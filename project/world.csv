Trump Announces 'Medal Of Freedom' Award For Charlie Kirk As JD Vance Meets Family After Shooting





US vice president JD Vance on Wednesday posted a heartfelt tribute to Charlie Kirk on social media, calling him “a true friend” and a major influence in his rise in national politics.Kirk, the conservative activist who was shot dead Wednesday at Utah Valley University, helped shape Vance’s path from a MAGA outsider to the vice presidency.“Charlie was fascinated by ideas and always willing to learn and change his mind,” Vance wrote.“Like me, he was skeptical of Donald Trump in 2016. Like me, he came to see president Trump as the only figure capable of moving American politics away from the globalism that had dominated for our entire lives. When others were right, he learned from them. When he was right — as he usually was — he was generous.”Vance said Kirk was crucial to his 2022 Senate campaign in Ohio, helping with strategy, fundraising and grassroots connections.“He introduced me to some of the people who would run my campaign and also to Donald Trump Jr, who took a call from me because Charlie asked,” Vance wrote.Kirk also remained deeply involved with Vance’s family. “Our kids, especially our oldest, struggled with the attention and the constant presence of the protective detail. I felt this acute sense of guilt, that I had conscripted my kids into this life without getting their permission.And Charlie was constantly calling and texting, checking on our family and offering guidance and prayers.”Vance recalled learning about Kirk’s shooting through group messages with friends and government officials. “God didn’t answer those prayers, and that’s ok. He had other plans. And now that Charlie is in heaven, I’ll ask him to talk to (the) big man directly on behalf of his family, his friends, and the country he loved so dearly.”Vance and his wife Usha accompanied the conservative activist on his final flight home.

Imprisonment in harsh conditions

Family’s response and fundraising challenges

Legal implications and future outlook





A 23-year-old British law student from Merseyside has been sentenced to 25 years in Dubai’s Central Prison after being convicted of drug trafficking. Caught with 50 grams of cocaine, Mia O’Brien now faces a future behind bars in one of the region’s most notorious prisons, as her family back home scrambles for support.Mia O’Brien, a law student from Liverpool University and resident of Huyton, Merseyside, was arrested in October after authorities allegedly discovered 50 grams of cocaine in her Dubai apartment. The drugs were found in a single large lump, and local officials charged her with drug dealing — a serious offence under the United Arab Emirates’ strict narcotics laws.O’Brien was arrested alongside a female friend and the friend’s boyfriend. All three faced similar drug charges. Despite pleading not guilty, Mia was convicted during a swift one-day court hearing on July 25. The judge sentenced her to 25 years in prison — often classified under UAE law as a life sentence — and imposed a fine of £100,000.According to estimates, the street value of the seized cocaine would be around £2,500 in the UK.Following her sentencing, Mia was transferred to Dubai Central Prison, a facility widely known for its harsh and often brutal conditions.Reports from previous years describe a system plagued by overcrowding, abuse, and systemic violence.According to her mother, Danielle McKenna, Mia is currently held in a cramped cell with six other inmates, most of whom are Nigerian nationals. She described her daughter’s emotional state as “absolutely devastated,” noting that Mia had always dreamed of becoming a lawyer or solicitor before this incident drastically altered her life path.Communication with Mia has been limited and closely monitored. “I speak to her but she can't say too much on the phone,” her mother said. Conditions inside the prison are reported to be extreme — with torture used to extract confessions and frequent accounts of rape and violence, both from inmates and prison staff.In an effort to bring her daughter home or improve her legal situation, Danielle McKenna launched a fundraising campaign on GoFundMe. However, the platform removed the page on Friday, citing violations of its Terms of Service.A GoFundMe spokesperson explained the takedown, referencing Term 9 of their Prohibited Conduct policy: “It was removed because it violates Term 9 of the Prohibited Conduct section in our Terms of Service. Term 9 prohibits raising funds on GoFundMe for the legal defense of certain alleged crimes.”In response, Danielle turned to social media to continue seeking help. She shared her personal bank details on Facebook, urging people to send donations directly. Explaining her move, she wrote: “I am going to set up my own, as they [GoFundMe] are nitpicking at everything.” She also noted that direct contributions would avoid platform fees: “This way I get to keep everything.”Despite the setback, she thanked those who had shown support: “I would just like to thank everyone.”On the original GoFundMe page, she had described Mia as a bright and well-meaning young woman who had fallen in with the wrong crowd:“Mia is only 23 years old and has never done a bad thing in her life. This is a young girl, who went to university to do law, and unfortunately got mixed up in the wrong so-called friends and made a very stupid mistake and is now paying the price.”Under UAE law, drug trafficking carries extremely severe penalties, including life imprisonment or, in rare cases, the death penalty. While Mia’s 25-year sentence is considered a “life sentence” under Emirati legal definitions, her family still hopes to reduce or overturn the decision through appeal or intervention.As of now, no official UK government statement has been made regarding diplomatic efforts in Mia’s case. However, past instances have seen British consular support offered in cases involving citizens jailed abroad.The case serves as a stark reminder of the strict anti-drug laws in the Middle East and the life-altering consequences that can arise from even a single misstep.","Mia O’Brien, a 23-year-old law student from Merseyside, was arrested in October.

US condemns decision, warns of response



Divided Brazil, inflamed politics



Bolsonaro’s future







Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro was sentenced to 27 years and three months in prison on Thursday after the country’s Supreme Court convicted him of attempting a coup to remain in power following his 2022 electoral defeat to President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.The unprecedented ruling handed down by a panel of five justices, four of whom voted to convict, makes Bolsonaro the first former Brazilian leader found guilty of trying to overturn a democratic election. He was convicted on five counts, including plotting to abolish the rule of law, belonging to an armed criminal organisation, and inciting violence.Bolsonaro, who has consistently denied wrongdoing, remains under house arrest in Brasilia. He can still appeal the decision. The court now has 60 days to publish the ruling, after which his lawyers will have five days to file motions for clarification. Legal experts say such appeals rarely change outcomes.The ruling immediately sparked international backlash, most notably from Washington. US President Donald Trump said he was “very unhappy” with the conviction, calling Bolsonaro “outstanding.”Secretary of state Marco Rubio denounced the ruling as a “witch hunt” in a post on X, vowing the Trump administration would “respond accordingly.”The United States had already slapped a 50 per cent tariff on Brazilian goods earlier this year, citing the case against Bolsonaro — a move analysts say foreshadowed further sanctions.In Brazil, the trial has inflamed political tensions. Supporters of the far-right leader have taken to the streets, claiming the case is political persecution. His eldest son, Sen. Flávio Bolsonaro, called the verdict a “supreme persecution,” insisting history would vindicate his father.Justice Cármen Lúcia, siding with the majority, said she was persuaded by evidence from the Attorney General’s Office. “He is the instigator, the leader of an organisation that orchestrated every possible move to maintain or seize power,” she said. Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who oversaw the case, branded Bolsonaro the head of a criminal coup plot.President Lula said Thursday that “hundreds of pieces of evidence” showed Bolsonaro attempted a coup against Brazil’s democracy.Bolsonaro is already barred from running for office until 2030 in a separate case, but he remains an influential figure in Brazilian politics. Observers expect him to back a political heir to challenge Lula in the next election.Despite Thursday’s ruling, Bolsonaro will not immediately go to prison. But with appeals unlikely to succeed and diplomatic tensions rising, Brazil now faces a volatile period of political and international fallout.","Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro sentenced to 27 years and three months in prison.

In a major push to modernise citizen services and reduce red tape, the UAE government has rolled out a streamlined process for renewing and replacing Emirates ID cards. Under the updated system, UAE citizens can now complete the entire procedure in a single step, with the card’s validity automatically determined based on age—mirroring the process used for Emirati passports.As part of the second cycle of the Zero Bureaucracy Programme, the Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Port Security (ICP) has overhauled the Emirates ID services for citizens. The key change simplifies what was once a multi-step procedure into a single-step process—now limited to submitting the application and paying the service fee.This major shift is intended to eliminate bureaucratic friction, enhance the customer experience, and align with the UAE’s wider goal of delivering efficient, digital-first government services. The ICP highlighted that this move is consistent with its broader strategy to modernise smart services, shorten service journeys, and meet the public’s expectations for convenience and accessibility.A central feature of the revamped system is the automatic determination of the Emirates ID validity period, a model borrowed from the country’s passport service. The validity is assigned as follows:This applies when the service requested is renewal.In the case of replacement, the new ID card will be issued with the same validity period remaining on the existing card. Applicants cannot alter or extend the validity duration manually in any scenario.The Emirates ID application form has also undergone a redesign in the smart services system, available via the ICP’s official website and mobile application. Notable improvements include:These changes help citizens complete the process more quickly, while reducing the possibility of errors or duplication.The updated services for both Emirates ID renewal and replacement are already live and accessible through the ICP’s online platforms. Citizens can now complete the full process through the website or smart app, without needing to navigate multiple steps or submit duplicate information.This transition marks another milestone in the UAE's commitment to digitally transform public services, enhance operational efficiency, and reinforce its reputation for excellence in governance and service delivery.UAE citizens can now renew or replace their Emirates ID through a simplified process that involves just one step.

Understanding solar eclipses – Types and what to expect

Total solar eclipse



The Moon completely covers the Sun.

Observers in a narrow zone experience brief daylight darkness.

Spectacular but rare. Partial solar eclipse



Only part of the Sun is covered by the Moon.

Creates a crescent or “bitten” appearance of the Sun.

This is the type occurring on September 21, 2025. Annular solar eclipse



The Moon is farther from Earth and doesn’t fully cover the Sun.

A ring of sunlight remains visible, forming the “ring of fire” effect.





In an extraordinary celestial turn, September 2025 is bookended by two eclipses, a lunar eclipse on the 7th and a solar eclipse just 15 days later. While the Moon recently turned a vivid red in a dramatic lunar display, the sky will offer another rare phenomenon: a partial solar eclipse on September 21, timed just before the equinox. However, this spectacle won’t be visible everywhere, and the UAE is among the regions that will miss it.The final solar eclipse of 2025 is scheduled for September 21. Unlike a total eclipse, this will be a partial solar eclipse, where the Moon covers only part of the Sun, creating a crescent-shaped sliver of sunlight.This event holds additional significance because it closely precedes the September equinox, which falls on September 22, 2025. The equinox is one of two moments in the year when the Sun is directly above the Earth’s equator, resulting in nearly equal day and night lengths across the globe. Because of this timing, the eclipse is also being called an ""equinox eclipse"", adding to its astronomical and symbolic intrigue.The event also carries cultural and astrological meaning. This year's Pitru Paksha — a fortnight in the Hindu calendar dedicated to ancestral remembrance and rituals — uniquely begins with a lunar eclipse and ends with this solar eclipse, a rare alignment astrologers consider especially potent.Also Read: Saudi National Day 2025 The September 21 partial solar eclipse will be visible only in specific parts of the Southern Hemisphere, offering clear views to skywatchers in select regions.Unlike the lunar eclipse on September 7, which had wide visibility across many countries, this solar eclipse will not be visible in the UAE or most parts of the Northern Hemisphere.Countries that will not witness any part of the eclipse include:This means millions of skywatchers across Asia and the Americas will miss the event entirely — a sharp contrast to the global excitement generated by the earlier lunar eclipse.A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon moves between the Earth and the Sun, partially or fully blocking sunlight in specific areas on Earth. These alignments don’t happen frequently in the same place due to the precise positioning required.There are three main types of solar eclipses:Although this particular eclipse is not a total one, its timing, rarity, and symbolic links to the equinox and Pitru Paksha make it a notable event in the 2025 celestial calendar.","The final solar eclipse of 2025 on September 21 will be partially visible in southern Australia.

A new video has surfaced, giving investigators a closer look at the 'person of interest' in the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The video shows the person of interest limping through a residential neighbourhood near Utah Valley University.The footage, obtained by TMZ, was recorded on home surveillance systems both before and after Kirk was shot and killed on Wednesday while speaking at a campus event.In the video, the person of interest is seen wearing a black long-sleeve shirt, a black hat, sunglasses and a backpack. At one point, the figure can be observed walking with a noticeable limp.The individual closely resembles the man already depicted in images released by authorities, showing someone descending steps at Utah Valley University.The FBI and Utah department of public safety have described the unidentified individual as a “person of interest,” urging anyone with information to come forward. A $100,000 reward remains in place for tips that lead to a breakthrough. Authorities have released fresh images of the suspect, who is seen wearing a black shirt with American flag, blue jeans grey cap and carrying a black backpack.Kirk, 31, founder of Turning Point USA and an ally of US President Donald Trump, was shot in the neck by a sniper’s bullet while addressing students during his signature “Prove Me Wrong” debate. He was later pronounced dead at a hospital.Law enforcement has already recovered a high-powered bolt-action rifle believed to have been used in the attack, along with a palm print, footprint and a forearm impression along the escape route.","New surveillance video shows limping 'person of interest' in Charlie Kirk assassination.

Investigation to find the shooter of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk has been intensified after authorities recovered a ""high-powered, bolt-action rifle"" from woods on Thursday. Now, investigators have collected a home surveillance camera after a family said that the suspect may have recorded the person of interest in a neighbour's backyard.According to Fox News Digital, a family member said that his camera may have recorded the suspect, who is on the run after killing 31-year-old Charlie Kirk at Utah University.Officials and agents from the US bureau of alcohol, tobacco, firearms and explosives reached his home to collect the surveillance camera. One of the officials was seen climbing a ladder and removing the entire floodlight unit, including a home security camera.“We think he ran down the alleyway, ditched his weapon, bypassed the fence where it ended and crossed through one of our properties,” said Erwin Steele, whose family owns several homes in the area, according to Fox News Digital. Steele’s brother owned the surveillance camera.Rifle, prints among key evidenceThe shooting occurred on Wednesday afternoon as Kirk, 31, founder of the conservative student group Turning Point USA and a father of two, addressed a crowd in the university courtyard.Investigators later found a high-powered bolt-action rifle in a wooded area near the route the suspect is believed to have used to escape, according to Robert Bohls, special agent in charge of the FBI’s Salt Lake City office.Authorities also recovered a palm print, a footprint and an impression believed to have come from a forearm along the escape path.The FBI on Thursday released two images of a man dressed in black they described as a “person of interest.” Officials have not said whether he is suspected of being the shooter, but urged the public to share any information about his identity.The Orem neighbourhood, which sits just beyond a chain-link fence separating it from the UVU campus, has become a focal point of the investigation. Residents say the escape route may have taken the suspect through backyards before he vanished.","Investigators have collected a home surveillance camera after a family said that the suspect may have recorded the person of interest in a neighbour's backyard.

Poll Is it ethical for governments to use technology from foreign countries for surveillance? Yes, if it protects citizens No, it compromises sovereignty





Pakistan — with the help of Chinese technology — is spying on millions of its citizens to curb dissent and free speech, an Amnesty International report said.According to the report, Pakistan is using a Chinese-built internet firewall that censors social media, enabling spy agencies to monitor at least 4 million mobile phones at a time through its Lawful Intercept Management System (LIMS). The firewall, known as WMS 2.0, inspects internet traffic and can block 2 million active sessions at once.The human rights watchdog said it reviewed licensing agreements, trade data, leaked technical files, and Chinese records linking the firewall supplier to state-owned firms in Beijing.Amnesty said the firewall uses equipment from US-based Niagara Networks, software from Thales DIS — a unit of France's Thales — and servers from a Chinese state IT firm. An earlier version relied on Canada’s Sandvine.""The two monitoring systems function in tandem: one lets intelligence agencies tap calls and texts, while the other slows or blocks websites and social media across the country,"" the report said.""Mass surveillance creates a chilling effect in society, whereby people are deterred from exercising their rights, both online and offline,"" it added.The report further said that Pakistan is currently blocking about 650,000 web links and restricting access to platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, and X.It also accused agencies of spying on at least 4 million mobile phones at a time through LIMS, while WMS 2.0 can block 2 million active sessions at once, Amnesty said.Amnesty noted that its findings draw on a 2024 Islamabad High Court case filed by Bushra Bibi, the wife of former Prime Minister Imran Khan, after her private calls were leaked online.In court, Pakistan's defense ministries and intelligence agencies denied running or even having the capacity for phone tapping. However, under questioning, the telecom regulator admitted it had already ordered phone companies to install LIMS for use by ""designated agencies.""Crackdowns have tightened in recent years, particularly after the military broke with then Prime Minister Imran Khan in 2022. Khan was later jailed, and thousands of his party activists were detained.","Amnesty International: Pakistan using Chinese-built internet firewall that censors social media.

Both were later taken into custody and moved to the Adiala checkpoint.PTI condemned the act as “shameful,” alleging the women were planted for political motives and accusing police of helping them escape in a car. “The women were sent to Aleema's media talk as part of an agenda,” the party said.Leaders across the political spectrum criticized the attack.Balochistan National Party-Mengal chief Akhtar Mengal condemned the act, calling it “the lowest form of politics.”He said, “Even in enmity, a woman deserves dignity.

A relatively unknown militant group, Ittihad-ul-Mujahideen (IuM) Pakistan, has claimed responsibility for the suicide car bomb attack on the Federal Constabulary Corps in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Bannu division on Tuesday.The outfit claimed the attack, which involved a car rigged with IED, killed more than two dozen members of the Frontier Corps but Pakistan acknowledged only six fatalities. Predictably, it blamed India for the attack. Pakistan claimed to have neutralised five operatives in a 12-hour counter operation but the group asserted that its 'fidayeen' blew themselves up after carrying out the attack. One of the suicide bombers was identified by the group as Abdul Aziz alias Qassid Mohajir, a resident of Afghanistan's Paktika province.The Pakistan army camp suffered massive destruction in the suicide attack. Pakistan military's ISPR played down the incident, the latest in a series of attacks on Pakistani military personnel. ""During early hours of Sept 2, Indian proxy 'Fitna al Khwarij' targeted the Federal Constabulary Headquarters in Bannu district. The Indian-sponsored Kharjis attempted to breach the perimeter security, however, their nefarious designs were swiftly foiled by vigilant and resolute response.In their desperation, the Kahrjis rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into the perimeter wall. The suicide blast resulted in the partial collapse of the perimeter wall and damage to adjacent civilian infrastructure, inflicting injuries to three innocent civilians,"" ISPR said.IuM Pakistan, active since April, comprises fighters from outfits like Hafiz Gul Bahadur Group, Lashkar-e-Islam and Jamaat-Ul-Ahrar. In the last few months, it has claimed multiple attacks in areas like North Waziristan, Miranshah and Tirah Valley. Its strikes included sniper, rocket launcher and grenade attacks, and ambushes on convoys, besides drone strikes. Its formation had attracted criticism from groups like Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan which termed itself as the most structured and legitimate jihadi group in Pakistan.","Ittihad-ul-Mujahideen (IuM) Pakistan has claimed responsibility for the suicide car bomb attack on the Federal Constabulary Corps in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Bannu division on Tuesday.

BEIJING: Pakistan's army chief field marshal Asim Munir had his first meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping , along with Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif , on Tuesday during which the two sides held wide-ranging talks on bilateral and regional cooperation.Munir is part of Sharif's delegation, which participated in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in Tianjin and will attend a grand parade of the Chinese army to be held here on Wednesday to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression.During his first visit to China in July after taking over as field marshal, Munir met vice president Han Zheng but not President Xi, unlike his predecessor general Qamar Javed Bajwa.His visit followed after he was hosted for lunch by US President Donald Trump, a rare gesture by an American leader which raised eyebrows in China, considering Pak-China all-weather ties.While Xi met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and a host of other leaders, who attended the SCO summit in Tianjin, Sharif was allocated the slot on Tuesday to meet the Chinese President in Beijing.Munir was expected to join Sharif to watch the parade in which the Chinese military plans to display its most modern weapons of all varieties, including aerial, ground, electronic and missile systems.The weapons systems were of big interest to the Pakistan military as over 80 per cent of its weapons acquisitions are from China.During the meeting, the two sides held wide-ranging talks on bilateral & regional cooperation, said deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar, who was also part of the team.Xi said that as global changes unseen in a century are unfolding at a quicker pace, a strong China-Pakistan relationship is conducive to safeguarding regional peace and development.The two sides should accelerate building an even closer China-Pakistan community with a shared future in the new era, to bring more benefits to the two peoples and set up a model for the broader neighbourhood, he said.China stands ready to work with Pakistan to build upgraded versions of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor and the China-Pakistan Free Trade Agreement, and hopes Pakistan will take effective measures to ensure the safety of Chinese personnel, projects and institutions in Pakistan, Xi was quoted as saying by the state-run Xinhua news agency.On his part, Sharif hailed the Global Governance Initiative (GGI), proposed by Xi at the SCO summit to improve global governance, saying it is of great significance for world peace, development and stability, and Pakistan will give it full support and work actively to implement it.Pakistan firmly sticks to the one-China principle, and looks forward to further strengthening friendship between the two countries and advancing cooperation in all fields, said Sharif, promising to spare no effort in ensuring the safety of all Chinese personnel, projects and institutions in Pakistan.","Pakistan's army chief field marshal Asim Munir had his first meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan's defence minister Khawaja Asif on Tuesday came up with a bizarre solution to tackle floods in the country's northern parts by suggesting that people store the floodwater and take it to their homes.While talking to a local news channel, Asif said that excess water should be taken as a ""form of blessing.""""Now this water, someone should store it.

Op Sindoor: Report Reveals Pakistan Lost Rs 1240cr In 2 Months After Shutting Airspace For India

The Express Tribune





Pakistan’s flagship social safety programme, the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), is once again under fire for corruption, with the Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP) uncovering large-scale graft involving its own employees. According to audit findings, as many as 324 officials, from the lowest Grade 1 to the highest Grade 22, embezzled over Rs 37 million, local media reported on Sunday.Citing the AGP’s revelations,said the rot runs through every level of the bureaucracy. What was envisioned as a lifeline for the country’s poorest has been consistently hollowed out by systemic fraud and abuse. And the Rs 37 million loss, auditors warn, may only scratch the surface.Just months earlier, audit reports for FY24 exposed irregularities worth Rs 141 billion in BISP, ranging from payments to ineligible beneficiaries to bogus biometric verifications and even funds being transferred to the accounts of deceased individuals.“In effect, those entrusted with administering aid to the poor are instead perpetuating poverty,” the report noted.The AGP findings also highlight the involvement of not just BISP employees but also banks and retailers, some of whom were caught illegally skimming fees from beneficiaries using BISP cards. Despite being identified, several perpetrators reportedly “escaped criminal charges despite being caught red-handed and named publicly,”reported.The culture of impunity, it added, remains entrenched. “Even if guilty officials are prosecuted and terminated, recent history has shown that the fear of consequences has not particularly slowed corruption in most government departments, and BISP is no different.”The report stressed that the system’s checks must be tightened: “Controls need to be more proactive, including transparent biometric systems, stricter verification processes and independent monitoring mechanisms.”With BISP catering to roughly 58 million people—nearly a quarter of Pakistan’s population—its credibility carries enormous weight. “Allowing it to become a corrupt and untrusted institution is not just a betrayal of honest and deserving beneficiaries, but of every single taxpayer and international donor supporting the programme,” the report warned.","As many as 324 officials, from the lowest Grade 1 to the highest Grade 22, embezzled over Rs 37 million.

Flood Threat For Pakistan As India Releases Water From Swollen Rivers Day After Alerting Islamabad





AMRITSAR: Embarrassed by a viral video showing its side of the parade path at Wagah border badly waterlogged - and its Rangers standing in knee-deep water - while the Indian side looks clean, Pakistan has blamed the elevation of Grand Trunk Road on the Indian side for the mess.The fact is India has already implemented a rainwater harvesting system and improved drainage management to prevent waterlogging.Pakistan is battling severe floods after relentless heavy rain over the past few days. Its side of the parade area at the site of the daily flag ceremony at the Wagah joint checkpost is wallowing in muddy knee-deep water. Sandbags are seen piled up at a few places on the Pakistani side ahead of the ceremony. In contrast, the Indian side is free of water, except for a small area near the international border gates.Sources say Pakistan has raised the elevation of GT Road with Indian authorities. Pakistan also hastily constructed drainage channels and elevated a portion of the road to facilitate water outflow. BSF IG, Punjab Frontier, Atul Fulzele said there was incessant and heavy rainfall on Aug 8-9, and the video was likely from that period.""There has been no waterlogging at any of the three sites of the ceremonial flag-lowering ceremonies - Attari, Hussainiwala, and Sadqi. "" However, several border outposts (BoPs) along the Punjab Frontier were inundated due to heavy rainfall, and some had to be evacuated, he said.BoPs located in enclaves beyond the Ravi river and short of the international border are also being evacuated due to severe flooding.","Pakistan is battling severe floods after relentless heavy rain over the past few days.

Nepal’s political turmoil has entered uncharted territory, with uncanny echoes of the violent upheavals in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. What began as a Gen Z–driven digital revolt against corruption and nepotism has forced Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli and his cabinet to resign and go into hiding, leaving the Himalayan nation on the verge of forming a caretaker interim government. The escalating unrest has also triggered talk of a “larger conspiracy” behind the anarchy.“I don’t see any conspiracy being hatched before September 8, the day Gen Z organised their spontaneous protests seeking justice. But the vandalism and the mindless violence that have taken place since then are clearly the handiwork of external and unknown actors,” said Namrata Sharma, Kathmandu-based senior journalist and vice president of the Nepal chapter of South Asian Women in Media (SAWM) told news agency PTI.Sharma called for urgent investigation into the forces behind the violence. “This escalation was definitely not part of Gen Z’s plan. It seems now that these external forces were keenly observing the initial developments from the sidelines and jumped into the fray, taking advantage of the situation, finding that the time was suitable for such acts,” she told PTI.The situation mirrors other recent uprisings in South Asia.In Dhaka, students took to the streets in August 2024 against a controversial job quota system, a movement that snowballed into nationwide protests and the eventual fall of Sheikh Hasina’s government. Hundreds died in the crackdown before Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus was chosen to head an interim government, with the army playing mediator.Sri Lanka too witnessed mass protests between March and July 2022, fuelled by an economic meltdown of inflation, blackouts, and crippling shortages. Demonstrators stormed government buildings and clashed with troops, leading to Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s ouster. Like in Nepal, a ban on social media only fanned the anger.“The conspirators in Nepal have lit the fire but have little control over the means to douse the flames,” said CK Lal, author and political analyst.“Going by the nature of coordinated attacks that have happened across the country, it seems some preparations have been made behind them for quite some time. The social media ban lasted for only four days. There’s no way such violent repercussions could have been orchestrated across the country in such a short span,” he added.Lok Raj Baral, former Ambassador of Nepal to India, underlined the differences despite parallels. “In Bangladesh, the ruling Awami League was banned and Sheikh Hasina fled the country. But in Nepal it is not so. The major political parties still remain here and I have reasons to believe that they will soon return,” he said.Still, Baral did not rule out the role of outsiders. “Within the country, there are groups of disgruntled elements who do not want the constitutional setup to remain in its present form,” he said.Sharma meanwhile pointed to Nepal’s sensitive location as a factor. “We are bound on both our north and south by two powerful neighbours, China and India, respectively. Western nations also keep a close eye on Nepal for its geopolitical location. So, there’s always a possibility of interference in our internal matters,” she said.But others urged restraint in drawing conclusions. “To normal people like you and me, stability and harmony in a country are desirable for neighbouring nations because prosperity spills over. But policymakers think differently. They feel that unstable powers are easier to manipulate and control. Their logic and reasoning are different from those of ours,” said Ramesh Parajuli, Senior Researcher with Nepal-based NGO Martin Chautari.",Nepal's political turmoil has uncanny echoes of the violent upheavals in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.

Sushila Karki, Nepal’s former Chief Justice and one of three names suggested by protestors to lead a proposed interim government in the unrest-hit Himalayan nation, is married to politician Durga Prasad Subedi — who was involved in a plane hijacking 52 years ago.Then a youth leader of the Nepali Congress, Subedi led a three-member team in a 1973 hijacking masterminded by Girija Prasad Koirala — who would later serve four terms as Nepal’s prime minister — to raise funds for an “armed struggle” against the monarchy under King Mahendra.On June 10, 1973, Subedi, along with Nagendra Dhungel and Basanta Bhattarai, boarded a 19-seater aircraft in Nepal's Biratnagar that was bound for Kathmandu. The plane was carrying Rs 30 lakh in Indian currency from India to the Nepali capital.Among the passengers were actor couple CP Lohani of Nepal and Indian film star Mala Sinha.As planned, the hijackers, after a brief struggle with the crew, forced the pilot to land in Forbesganj, Bihar, where five other conspirators were waiting. The group offloaded three boxes of cash before the aircraft quickly took off again with the remaining passengers.Within a year, after hiding in various locations across India, all members of the group — except Dhungel — were arrested one by one by authorities. They were later released on bail and returned to Nepal shortly before the 1980 referendum.","Sushila Karki is one of three names suggested by protestors to lead a proposed interim government in the unrest-hit Himalayan nation.

According to sources, the current discussions aim to nominate a caretaker leader who will oversee fresh elections within a set timeframe and map out the political transition.“The new executive head will be the one who will conduct fresh elections within a specified time frame,” the sources said to PTI.Alongside Sushila Karki and Balendra Shah, former Nepal Electricity Authority chief Kulman Ghising and Dharan Mayor Harka Sampang are also being considered for the interim leadership.Although sources say Shah has backed Karki’s candidacy, there is no consensus yet on who will head the new cabinet, with sections of the Gen Z movement expressing reservations about her.Nepal has been in turmoil since Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli resigned on Tuesday amid mass protests, prompting the Army to assume control of law and order.Sushila Karki made history in 2016 as Nepal’s first female Chief Justice. A former Supreme Court justice, senior advocate and law professor, she became known for rulings that challenged political interference. Her tenure ended abruptly in 2017 after lawmakers filed an impeachment motion accusing her of bias and overreach following her decision to overturn a police chief appointment on seniority grounds. Although automatically suspended, the motion failed before her retirement in June 2017. Born in Biratnagar in 1952, Karki studied political science at Banaras Hindu University and law at Tribhuvan University. She has written on gender equality and won several legal awards.Balendra Shah, popularly known as “Balen,” is a 35-year-old rapper-turned-politician serving as Kathmandu’s 15th mayor since May 2022. Running as an independent, he became the first non-party candidate to win the post. An engineer by training, Balen earned a civil engineering degree and later studied structural engineering at Visvesvaraya Technological University in Karnataka, India. Before politics, he was active in Nepal’s underground hip-hop scene, using music to criticise corruption and inequality. In June 2023, he grabbed headlines by banning the screening of Indian films in Kathmandu over a controversial dialogue in, cementing his reputation as an assertive, unconventional leader.Kulman Ghising, 54, former managing director of the Nepal Electricity Authority, has emerged as the leading choice to head Nepal’s interim government. Celebrated for ending the country’s crippling power cuts, he is viewed as a clean, pragmatic technocrat whose apolitical image aligns with Gen Z protesters’ calls for a corruption-free administration. Born on 25 November 1970 in rural Ramechhap, Ghising studied electrical engineering in Jamshedpur, power systems in Kathmandu and earned an MBA from Pokhara University. Joining the NEA in 1994, he rose through senior posts before taking charge in 2016, turning the utility profitable and restoring round-the-clock electricity to urban Nepal.",Nepal has been in turmoil since Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli resigned on Tuesday amid mass protests.

Nepal In Flames: PM KP Oli Resigns, Flees In Army Chopper As Gen Z Protesters Burn Down Parliament

Poll Do you support the Gen Z movement's protests against the lifestyles of 'Nepo Kids'? Yes, absolutely! No, I do not support it.

What happens next



Constitutional process



Possibility of interim government



Former chief justice seen as top choice



Who might protesters support?







A social media campaign by young Nepalis against the lifestyles of ""Nepo Kids"", the children of politicians flaunting wealth online, went on to grow into the deadliest unrest Nepal has faced in years and led to the resignation of the prime minister.On Wednesday morning, soldiers enforced a curfew in Kathmandu as smoke rose from the streets and speculation spread about a possible meeting between leaders of the Gen Z movement, the army, and the president.This followed two nights of violent protests in which tens of thousands marched, set fire to parliament and the Supreme Court, and clashed with security forces.The protests began in early September with a peaceful demonstration by young Nepalis frustrated with posts of politicians’ children showing luxury travel and expensive items while most people faced economic difficulties. Discontent had also been building for years over youth unemployment and limited opportunities.The government’s decision last week to ban more than two dozen social media platforms, including Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp, intensified the anger.For now, the army has taken charge. Army chief General Ashok Raj Sigdel met on Wednesday with ""representatives of Gen Z,"" according to a spokesman, though no further details were given.Meanwhile, the Nepal Army extended prohibitory orders in three districts of the Kathmandu Valley on Thursday, while allowing public movement during specific windows. Additionally, two persons died and more than a dozen inmates were injured when army troops opened fire on Thursday morning to stop a mass breakout from Ramechhap District Prison, local media reports said.Moreover, analysts said creating a ""transitional arrangement"" with broad legitimacy may be difficult, especially since the protesters have no single leader.Nepal’s 2015 constitution requires that a new prime minister be appointed from the party with a majority in parliament. If no party has a majority, the president appoints someone who can demonstrate support and they must secure a confidence vote within 30 days. If they fail, other members may try, and if none succeed, the house can be dissolved and elections held.Protesters, however, have expressed distrust of major party leaders, many of whom are in hiding. It is unclear whether they will accept this constitutional process.The constitution does not mention an interim government, but some experts suggest one could be created outside of the formal process if agreed upon.""Such a government can pursue the agenda for change that Gen Z want and also hold elections for a new parliament within six months,"" constitutional expert Bipin Adhikari was quoted as saying by the news agency Reuters, adding it should include broad representation.Sushila Karki, Nepal’s former chief justice, has emerged as the leading candidate to head an interim government, according to a representative of the protesters.""Right now, Sushila Karki’s name is coming up to lead the interim government — we are now waiting for the president to make a move,"" Rakshya Bam, who attended a meeting with the army chief about the country’s leadership, was quoted as saying by the news agency AFP.Protesters are also likely to support Balendra Shah, 35, a rapper and music composer who was elected mayor of Kathmandu in 2022 and has gained popularity among young people for his work to clean the city.Another possible choice is Rabi Lamichhane, a former television journalist who entered politics in 2022 by forming the Rastriya Swatantra Party.According to local media reports, protesters freed Lamichhane from prison on Tuesday, where he had been held while facing trial over alleged misuse of funds.","Nepal’s 2015 constitution requires that a new prime minister be appointed from the party with a majority in parliament.

NEW DELHI: Dramatic scenes unfolded in Nepal as protesters did not spare 'corrupt' ministers and their families, who were evacuated via military helicopters' rescue slings.Visuals of Nepalese hanging onto ropes and being rescued by choppers went viral on social media, with protesters looking on from ground.The suspension of social media platforms triggered violent demonstrations in Kathmandu, resulting in Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli's resignation and departure from the country. The military has been deployed to maintain order, with soldiers patrolling the capital's streets and implementing stay-at-home directives.Social media footage showed government officials and their relatives being airlifted to safety using army helicopter rescue slings amidst escalating public outrage. The footage, shared on X, captured individuals suspended from helicopter rescue slings whilst departing the crisis-stricken nation.On Tuesday, a massive demonstration, primarily comprising student protesters, giving it the term Gen Z protests, resulted in widespread vandalism of government officials' residences and the Parliament building.The protesters targeted and burned communication minister Prithvi Subba Gurung's house, attacked deputy prime Minister Bishnu Paudel's residence, Nepal Rastra Bank governor Biswo Paudel's property, and former home minister Ramesh Lekhak's dwelling.Various recordings documented the finance minister being pursued and assaulted by protesters, whilst another showed crowds attacking foreign affairs minister Arzu Rana Deuba and her spouse, former prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, at their Kathmandu residence.Military helicopters evacuated several ministers and their families during these incidents. Footage showed Deuba, bloodied and distressed in a field, awaiting rescue.Prisoners initiated fires in cells and guard facilities, destroying the main entrance before escaping. Military personnel prevented the breakout, relocating inmates to alternative facilities. The unrest began following the government's restriction of social media platforms, citing non-compliance with registration requirements. The demonstrations evolved to reflect broader societal frustrations, particularly amongst youth opposing perceived nepotism in political families.With youth unemployment at approximately 20 percent in the previous year, according to World Bank data, governmental estimates indicate over 2,000 young people daily depart Nepal seeking employment in Middle Eastern or Southeast Asian countries.","Dramatic scenes unfolded in Nepal as protesters did not spare 'corrupt' ministers and their families, who were evacuated via military helicopters' rescue slings.

DEHRADUN: Journalists at Kantipur Media Group, which publishes the English daily Kathmandu Post, and Kantipur, the highest selling Nepalese daily, said they saw their office burned by Gen-Z protesters but fought the odds to make sure Wednesday's edition was published to record the developments that shook their nation on Tuesday.""The edition was late, but it was there,"" one journalist said, requesting anonymity citing security concerns. Another likened her colleagues and herself to a bird from Greek mythology that rises from its own ashes. ""We are like the phoenix... We will rise again and continue to fight for the truth,"" she said.She added that on Tuesday both KMG dailies had published a ""hard-hitting"" editorial piece asking the now ousted govt to step down following the killing of 19 protesters, including a few schoolchildren. ""Despite that, protesters destroyed our office, accusing us of siding with the now ousted govt,"" she said. ""What was supposed to be an important day in our careers as the country was witnessing such a major movement against prolonged unemployment, poverty and corruption, turned into the most harrowing one,"" said the journalist, who has been working with KMG, Nepal's biggest media house, for nearly a decade.The office in Thapathalli area, in the Kathmandu city centre, was torched on Tuesday evening along with the parliament, Singha Durbar, Supreme Court, the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (equivalent to India's Lokpal), ministers' homes, and even the attorney-general's office.The offices of Annapurna Media Network were also set ablaze.One journalist, who claimed that nearly 50 staff, including women, were lucky to survive, told TOI from Kathmandu over the phone that they got out of the KMG office a couple of hours before the fire engulfed the entire building. ""All of us left the office by around 12.30. By 3 pm we learned that the nine-storey building hosting our offices on the 7th and 8th floors had been set on fire,"" the journalist said.","Journalists at Kantipur Media Group say they saw their office burned by Gen-Z protesters.

LONDON: A prestigious award for sparkling wine has gone to an English bubbly rather than a wine from the Champagne region in France for the first time ever.Nyetimber’s £130 (Rs 15,000) Blanc de Blancs 2016 Magnum on Tuesday became the first ever non-Champagne wine to win the Champion Sparkling Wine Trophy at the International Wine Challenge (ICW) in London in the competition’s history.It was described by judges as a “racy, pithy blanc de blanc.. a time capsule of a wine with mouth-watering acidity, citrus zest and camomile, with a chalky finish”. It achieved 97 points, beating four others in the shortlist including the €260 (Rs 27,000) champagne Le Clos Lanson Blanc de Blanc 2010.Nyetimber’s head winemaker, Cherie Spriggs, also won Sparkling Winemaker of the Year for the second time, having first been awarded the trophy in 2018. At that time, she was the first person outside of Champagne to win the award and the first woman.British wine has never had more sparkle. Nyetimber is now the favourite among discerning high classes in the UK and is served at top restaurants, hotels and bars such as Annabel’s, The Goring, The Savoy and The Ivy. Nyetimber is not yet on sale in India.Spriggs and husband Brad Greatrix, who have been making English sparkling wine at Nyetimber, an historic estate, which appears in the Domesday Book, now owned by Dutchman Eric Heerema, since 2007, put its success down to the greensand and chalk soils at their 11 vineyards in West Sussex, Hampshire, and Kent. The soil is similar to that of the Champagne region thanks to the same chalk seam which runs under the English Channel.With the weather in England getting warmer owing to global warming, the South Downs has become ideal for growing the classic champagne grapes: Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Pinot Meunier.","Nyetimber’s £130 (Rs 15,000) Blanc de Blancs 2016 Magnum on Tuesday became the first ever non-Champagne wine to win the Champion Sparkling Wine Trophy at the International Wine Challenge.

US President Donald Trump will make an unprecedented second state visit to the United Kingdom from September 16 to 18, accompanied by First Lady Melania Trump.Trump was previously hosted by the late Queen Elizabeth II in June 2019. Traditionally, US presidents serving a second term are not offered a state visit; instead, they are usually invited for tea or lunch with the monarch, as was the case with Barack Obama and George W Bush.However, in February, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer presented Trump with an invitation from King Charles III during a White House meeting on a UK-US trade deal. Keir called the invitation ""truly historic"" and ""unprecedented,"" while Trump described it as a ""great, great honour.""On the second day of the visit, Trump and Melania will travel to Windsor Castle, where they will be greeted by the Prince and Princess of Wales before a formal welcome by the King and Queen. A royal salute will be fired in Windsor and at the Tower of London.Trump will lay a wreath at St George’s Chapel on the tomb of Queen Elizabeth II. Later, a flypast featuring UK and US F-35 fighter jets and the Red Arrows will take place. That evening, a traditional state banquet will be held at Windsor Castle, during which both the King and the US president will deliver speeches.On the third day, Trump will meet Starmer at Chequers. The agenda includes viewing the Winston Churchill archives, holding talks, and delivering a joint news conference.During his 2019 state visit, Trump traveled on Air Force One, and his motorcade — including the armoured limousine The Beast — was flown in by US Air Force transport aircraft.

Poll Should politicians be held accountable for their past associations and communications? Yes No





The United Kingdom prime minister has directed the foreign secretary to withdraw Peter Mandelson from his post as Ambassador to the United States after newly disclosed emails revealed a far deeper relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein than was previously known.According to officials, the correspondence shows that Mandelson not only maintained extensive contact with Epstein but also suggested that Epstein’s first conviction was “wrongful” and should be challenged — a position not disclosed at the time of his appointment.“In light of that, and mindful of the victims of Epstein’s crimes he has been withdrawn as Ambassador with immediate effect,” a government spokesperson said.This sacking came after The Sun and Bloomberg revealed he had sent supportive messages to Jeffrey Epstein while the financier was under investigation for sexual offences in the US in 2008.Emails showed the veteran Labour figure telling Epstein he was “following you closely and here whenever you need” and advising him to “remember the Art of War” when dealing with prosecutors. He also reportedly urged Epstein to “fight for early release” shortly before the financier received an 18-month sentence for procuring a child for prostitution, writing the day before sentencing: “I think the world of you.”Responding to the reports, the 71-year-old told the BBC he had relied on assurances of Epstein’s innocence that “turned out later to be horrendously false.”Kemi Badenoch MP, Leader of the Conservative Party, said: “Peter Mandelson is now gone, but Keir Starmer failed yet another key test of leadership. I asked him about Peter Mandelson’s links to the notorious paedophile Jeffrey Epstein six times at Prime Minister’s Questions. And six times he could not provide any answers. He gave his full backing to a man unfit for office. This matters for you. Because the Prime Minister has been distracted from the serious national security and economic challenges our country is facing. ""“He is a weak Prime Minister, who doesn’t have the courage to do the right thing at the right time. “The deficit is growing, debt is mounting, the welfare budget is spiralling out of control, and we are bracing for punishing tax rises from Rachel Reeves this Autumn. Enough is enough. The British public deserve a government focused on making sure our country is safe, lives within its means, and puts the public finances back on a sound footing. Only the Conservatives can deliver that,"" he added.",Newly disclosed emails reveal a far deeper relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein than was previously known.

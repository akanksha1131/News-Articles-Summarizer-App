Police identified the suspect as Junior Boucher and the victim as 65-year-old Brian Hiltebeitel.Witnesses told police Boucher hit Hiltebeitel with a golf club near the first hole. He then chased Hiltebeitel to a pond. The attack continued in the water. Witnesses heard Hiltebeitel yell, ""He's trying to kill me!"" Police say Boucher choked Hiltebeitel before leaving the pond and walking, half-naked, toward a wooded area.Officers arrived shortly after and found Hiltebeitel’s body in the pond. Despite efforts to revive him, he was pronounced dead at the scene. Boucher was soon spotted fleeing the area and was arrested after police used an electronic control device to subdue him.Palm Beach Gardens police officer Javier Garcia told USA Today that authorities are still investigating the case, saying, ""Detectives have not discovered a motive as of yet, as this appears to have been a random act of violence.""Officers used an ""electronic control device"" to arrest Boucher before taking him to a hospital for a medical check-up. He was then transported to jail, where he remains without bond. Boucher, a West Palm Beach resident, refused to speak with detectives without an attorney present. He is set to appear in court on December 26 to face the murder charge.The attack occurred around the same time Boucher’s family had reported him missing to the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office. Court records show that the same day, two relatives filed an eviction notice against him. This had also happened in 2018, according to court documents.","Junior Boucher, 36, faces a first-degree murder charge after police say he beat a golfer to death with the victim's clubs at a local golf course.

"'Baseless, without factual or legal foundation': Israel to appeal to ICC on arrest warrant against Netanyahu",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/baseless-without-factual-or-legal-foundation-israel-to-appeal-to-icc-on-arrest-warrant-against-netanyahu/articleshow/115750184.cms,"Photo/Agencies

Israel announced on Wednesday that it will appeal the arrest warrants issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defense minister Yoav Gallant.The country also requested that the ICC suspend the warrants until the appeal is resolved, according to a statement from Netanyahu's office.The ICC issued the warrants last week, citing suspicions of crimes against humanity and war crimes related to Israel’s military actions in Gaza following Hamas’s attack on October 7, 2023.Netanyahu and other Israeli officials criticized the warrants, with the prime minister accusing the ICC of bias and saying, ""The State of Israel challenges the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court (ICC) and the legitimacy of the arrest warrants issued."" ""Israel's notice of appeal reveals in detail how the decision to issue the arrest warrants was baseless and devoid of any factual or legal basis,"" the statement further said.The statement added that a rejection of the appeal would highlight what he described as the ICC’s bias against Israel.""If the court rejects this request, it will further demonstrate to Israel's friends in the United States and around the world how biased the International Criminal Court is against the State of Israel,"" it said.The ICC has not commented directly on the appeal. Fadi El-Abdallah, an ICC spokesperson, said that the decision would rest with the judges if an appeal is submitted.The ICC also issued an arrest warrant for Hamas military chief Mohammed Deif . Israel had claimed in August that Deif was killed in a July airstrike in southern Gaza, but Hamas has not confirmed his death.The court said on November 21 that it had ""reasonable grounds"" to believe Netanyahu and Gallant were criminally responsible for the war crime of starvation as a warfare method, as well as for crimes against humanity, including murder, persecution, and other inhumane acts.According to the rules of the International Criminal Court (ICC), the United Nations Security Council can adopt a resolution to pause or defer an investigation or prosecution for one year, with the option to renew it annually.Once an arrest warrant is issued, the concerned country or the individual named in the warrant can also challenge the court's jurisdiction or the admissibility of the case.","Israel announced on Wednesday that it will appeal the arrest warrants issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defense minister Yoav Gallant.

The FBI confirmed Wednesday that multiple members of Donald Trump 's incoming administration have been targeted with bomb threats and swatting incidents , heightening security concerns as the former president prepares to assume his position in January. Among the incidents reported was a pipe bomb threat accompanied by a pro-Palestinian message.""The FBI is aware of numerous bomb threats and swatting incidents targeting incoming administration nominees and appointees, and we are working with our law enforcement partners,"" the agency said in a statement.Swatting, a dangerous hoax tactic in which emergency services are dispatched under false pretenses, has become increasingly common in the United States, often targeting high-profile political figures.Karoline Leavitt, a spokesperson for Trump’s transition team, condemned the threats in a statement, “Last night and this morning, several of President Trump’s Cabinet nominees and Administration appointees were targeted in violent, unAmerican threats to their lives and those who live with them.""Those targeted included New York Rep Elise Stefanik, nominated by Trump to serve as the next ambassador to the United Nations; Matt Gaetz, Trump’s initial choice for attorney general; Oregon Rep Lori Chavez-DeRemer, selected to lead the Department of Labour; and former New York congressman Lee Zeldin, tapped to head the Environmental Protection Agency.Elise Stefanik, one of the highest-profile figures among the nominees, disclosed that her New York residence was subjected to a bomb threat. Stefanik, a staunch Trump loyalist, said that the threat occurred as she was traveling home with her family for Thanksgiving.Former congressman Lee Zeldin also reported a threat involving a pipe bomb and a message referencing pro-Palestinian sentiments. Zeldin confirmed that he and his family were not home during the incident.""A pipe bomb threat targeting me and my family at our home today was sent in with a pro-Palestinian themed message,"" he wrote on X. ""My family and I were not home at the time and are safe.""Fox News Digital, citing anonymous sources, reported that other nominees, including John Ratcliffe, nominated to lead the CIA, and Pete Hegseth, Trump’s pick for defense secretary, were also targeted.These threats come as Trump, who survived an assassination attempt during a campaign rally in July, continues to face a polaried political environment. In that incident, the former president sustained a minor ear injury before the assailant was killed in a counterattack.In a separate case, a man was arrested in September for allegedly plotting to shoot Trump at his Florida golf course.","The FBI confirmed Wednesday that multiple members of Donald Trump's incoming administration have been targeted with bomb threats and swatting incidents.

"Ohio Transgender Bathroom Law: New Ohio law restricts transgender students’ access to school restrooms, 'bathroom bill' sparks outcry",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/new-ohio-law-restricts-transgender-students-access-to-school-restrooms-bathroom-bill-sparks-outcry/articleshow/115749879.cms,"Supporters defend 'privacy and safety'

'

Broader context of

transgender rights debate

Ohio governor Mike DeWine signed the “Protect All Students Act” on Wednesday, prohibiting transgender students from using school bathrooms, locker rooms, or overnight accommodations aligning with their gender identity. Dubbed the ""bathroom bill,"" the law applies to public and private schools and colleges, taking effect in 90 days.The legislation mandates that facilities be designated exclusively for males and females based on biological sex assigned at birth. While it lacks enforcement mechanisms, it exempts school staff, emergencies, and caregivers assisting young children or those with disabilities.The bill’s sponsor, Republican State Senator Jerry Cirino , defended it as essential for privacy and safety, stating: “It revolves around safety, security, and, I think, common sense. It protects our children and grandchildren in private spaces where they are most vulnerable.” Aaron Baer, president of the Center for Christian Virtue, praised the law, saying, “Common sense is on a winning streak in America today. No student should be forced to go into the bathroom or locker room with a student of the opposite sex.”Opposition to the law has been swift and strong. The American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio labeled it an “anti-trans bathroom bill,” arguing it compromises transgender students' safety. Jocelyn Rosnick, the ACLU's policy director, called it a “cruel invasion of students’ rights to privacy.” Equality Ohio 's executive director, Dwayne Steward, criticized the measure, warning it puts vulnerable youth at greater risk. Both groups pledged to continue advocating for transgender students' rights.Ohio joins 11 other states that have enacted similar bathroom restrictions, with 26 states restricting or banning gender-affirming care for minors. Earlier this year, Ohio passed laws limiting gender-affirming care and barring transgender athletes in women’s sports.The national debate over transgender rights intensified during Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, which included promises to restrict transgender participation in women’s sports and limit gender-affirming healthcare. With Trump’s election win, Republican lawmakers plan to push similar measures in state legislatures convening in early 2025.While proponents argue these laws protect privacy and safety, critics say they unfairly target marginalized communities. Legal challenges loom, as the US supreme court prepares to review Tennessee’s ban on gender-affirming care, a decision that could affect similar laws nationwide.","Ohio governor Mike DeWine signed the “Protect All Students Act’ on Wednesday.

Dr Jay Bhattacharya: The 'anti-Covid lockdown' Bengali tasked by Trump to fix public health,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/dr-jay-bhattacharya-the-anti-covid-lockdown-bengali-tasked-by-trump-to-fix-public-health/articleshow/115736505.cms,"Early Life and Education: A Multidisciplinary Foundation



A Career Dedicated to Health Policy and Research



Pandemic Controversy: The Great Barrington Declaration



Restoring Trust in Public Health Institutions



Dr Jayanta ""Jay"" Bhattacharya, a Stanford professor of medicine and economics, is set to bring a transformative vision to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) as its next director under President-elect Donald Trump . Known for his contrarian stance during the COVID-19 pandemic and his advocacy for evidence-based, economically sound health policies, Bhattacharya’s nomination signals a bold shift in the Trump administration’s approach to public health. His multifaceted career in medicine, economics, and policy places him in a unique position to redefine the role of the NIH in addressing the nation’s most pressing health challenges.Born in 1968 in Kolkata, India, Bhattacharya immigrated to the United States as a child and quickly distinguished himself academically. He earned his undergraduate, medical, and doctoral degrees from Stanford University , where he remains a tenured professor. His Ph.D. in economics and MD from the Stanford School of Medicine have allowed him to examine healthcare through a multidisciplinary lens, combining clinical insight with economic analysis. Bhattacharya’s upbringing in a multicultural environment, along with his academic training, has shaped his understanding of global health challenges and the need for policies that balance medical science with social and economic realities.Throughout his academic career, Bhattacharya has focused on the health and well-being of vulnerable populations. As the director of Stanford’s Center for Demography and Economics of Health and Aging, he has studied the impact of aging, government programs, and biomedical innovation on public health. His work spans critical areas such as chronic disease management, healthcare disparities, and the economic implications of medical advancements. A prolific researcher, he has authored over 150 peer-reviewed articles and serves as a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research, among other affiliations. These roles have positioned him as both a scholar and an influencer in shaping health policy debates.Bhattacharya gained international recognition during the COVID-19 pandemic for his controversial opposition to lockdowns and vaccine mandates. As a co-author of the Great Barrington Declaration , he proposed a strategy of ""focused protection,"" advocating for the shielding of vulnerable populations while allowing lower-risk groups to resume normal life. His views, though polarizing, sparked vital conversations about the trade-offs inherent in public health interventions. Bhattacharya argued that prolonged lockdowns caused more harm than good, particularly for economically disadvantaged communities, and called for a more balanced approach that considered the social and economic costs of pandemic policies. This willingness to challenge conventional wisdom aligns with the Trump administration’s ethos of questioning entrenched bureaucracies.As the incoming director of the NIH, Bhattacharya is expected to prioritize restoring public trust in health institutions. He has been a vocal critic of the erosion of trust during the pandemic, attributing it to inconsistent messaging and the suppression of dissenting voices. At the NIH, Bhattacharya plans to promote transparency and open debate, fostering a culture where diverse perspectives are welcomed. His leadership is likely to emphasize the importance of free speech in science, protecting researchers from political or ideological pressures and ensuring that public health decisions are rooted in robust evidence.One of Bhattacharya’s primary objectives will be addressing the crisis of chronic illness in the United States. Chronic diseases account for the majority of healthcare costs and are a leading cause of mortality. Bhattacharya’s research background equips him to design innovative strategies to tackle these illnesses, focusing on preventive measures and cost-effective treatments. By leveraging the NIH’s vast resources, he aims to advance research on the underlying causes of chronic conditions, such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease, with an eye toward improving quality of life and reducing healthcare expenditures.Bhattacharya is also a staunch advocate for biomedical innovation. He has long argued that new technologies and treatments are essential for improving health outcomes, particularly in underserved populations. At the NIH, he intends to prioritize research that accelerates the development of cutting-edge therapies while ensuring equitable access. His tenure is expected to highlight the role of innovation in addressing disparities in healthcare, making breakthroughs accessible to those who need them most.Another critical area of focus for Bhattacharya will be the integration of public health interventions with economic considerations. Drawing on his expertise as a health economist, he is likely to advocate for policies that strike a balance between public health benefits and their social and economic impacts. His leadership will aim to ensure that future health crises are managed in a way that minimizes harm to society while protecting the most vulnerable. This approach reflects his belief in targeted solutions rather than broad, one-size-fits-all mandates.Joining forces with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump’s nominee for Secretary of Health and Human Services, Bhattacharya will play a key role in reshaping the nation’s health agenda. Together, they plan to address systemic issues in healthcare delivery, chronic illness management, and the federal government’s approach to medical research. Bhattacharya’s appointment reflects the Trump administration’s commitment to reforming public health institutions and fostering innovation while maintaining a critical eye on economic sustainability.","Dr Jayanta ""Jay"" Bhattacharya is set to bring a transformative vision to the National Institutes of Health.

India voices concerns over Das' arrest

As India hit out at Bangladesh for the arrest of Hindu priest Chinmoy Krishna Das , Dhaka reaffirmed its commitment to communal harmony , and said that it is dedicated to protecting all citizens, regardless of religious identity.Bangladesh's ministry of foreign in a statement said that Das was arrested on “specific charges” and dismissed allegations of religious discrimination.It criticised statements and reactions surrounding the arrest of Das, calling them “misconstrued” and harmful to the spirit of friendship between Dhaka and New Delhi.“It is with utter dismay and deep sense of hurt that the Government of Bangladesh notes that the arrest of Sri Chinmoy Krishna Das has been misconstrued by certain quarters since Sri Chinmoy Krishna Das has been arrested on specific charges,” the ministry said.""The Government of Bangladesh maintains that such unfounded statements not only misrepresent facts but also stand contrary to the spirit of friendship and understanding between the two neighboring countries,"" the statement added.The priest’s detention has sparked significant backlash, with thousands of his followers staging protests in Chattogram. Demonstrators blocked prison vehicles and called for his immediate release after his bail plea was denied, leading to the death of a lawyer.Bangladesh reiterated its commitment to communal harmony, citing the peaceful Durga Puja celebrations last month as evidence.""Bangladesh reaffirms in the strongest terms that every Bangladeshi, regardless of his or her religious identity, has the right to establish, maintain or perform respective religious rituals and practices or express views without hindrance,"" the statement said.Chief adviser to the interim government of Bangladesh Muhammad Yunus, in a separate statement condemned the murder of lawyer during the protest in Chattogram and announced an investigation. “The Interim Government is committed to ensuring and upholding communal harmony in Bangladesh at any cost,” Yunus said in a statement.Yunus also urged citizens to ""keep calm"" and ordered heightened security in vulnerable areas.""He has urged people to keep calm and stay away from participating in any untoward activities. He has also ordered law enforcement agencies to step up security in the port city, including in all the vulnerable neighbourhoods,"" the statement said.Earlier today, India had expressed ""deep concern"" over the arrest and denial of bail to Das , and urged the authorities to ensure the safety of Hindus and all minorities.""We have noted with deep concern the arrest and denial of bail to Shri Chinmoy Krishna Das, who is also the spokesperson of the Bangladesh Sammilit Sanatan Jagran Jote. This incident follows the multiple attacks on Hindus and other minorities by extremist elements in Bangladesh. There are several documented cases of arson and looting of minorities' homes and business establishments, as well as theft and vandalism and desecration of deities and temples,"" the MEA said in a statement.""We urge Bangladesh authorities to ensure the safety and security of Hindus and all minorities, including their right of freedom of peaceful assembly and expression,"" the statement said.The arrest of Chinmoy Krishna Das has drawn international and local condemnation. The Bangladesh Hindu Bouddha Christian Unity Council (BHBCUC), the country’s largest minority group, expressed concerns over the government’s actions. “This arrest tarnishes Bangladesh’s global image on freedom of expression and human rights,” remarked Manindra Kumar Nath, Acting General Secretary of BHBCUC.ISKCON Kolkata’s Vice President, Radharaman Das, also weighed in, calling the arrest “unfortunate.” He described Chinmoy Krishna Das as “the face of the protest” against the violence and discrimination faced by minorities in Bangladesh.","Bangladesh says arrest of Chinmoy Krishna Das has been misconstrued.

Rising Costs of Debt Servicing



Trump’s Strategy to Tackle Debt



Economic Growth or Fiscal Crisis?



Balancing Debt and Policy Ambitions



Political Implications and Future Outlook



As Donald Trump begins his second term as President, the US confronts a debt crisis of historic proportions. With national debt now at $36 trillion, experts warn the Debt-to-GDP ratio could soon surpass 200%, placing immense strain on the economy.America’s debt has ballooned at an alarming pace. From $5.7 trillion at the start of the century to $23.2 trillion by 2020, the surge has been further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which added $16 trillion in just a few years. Over the last 316 days, the debt has grown by $6.3 billion daily, meaning every American now effectively owes $108,000.Currently, the national debt stands at 125% of GDP, but projections suggest it may reach 200% in the coming years. Such a ratio would mean the debt surpasses the size of the entire US economy, forcing the government to allocate more funds to servicing this debt than to critical sectors like infrastructure, education, and healthcare.As debt climbs, the US government is spending over $1 billion daily on interest payments alone. This year, servicing the debt is expected to exceed $1 trillion—more than what is allocated for national defence. Rising interest rates compound the problem, increasing borrowing costs for both the government and ordinary citizens.Shai Akabas, from the Bipartisan Policy Center, explained: “The current level of debt is driving up interest rates, including mortgages, and raising living costs for households. This will dampen economic growth and reduce opportunities for future generations.”President Trump has responded by establishing the Department of Government Efficiency, led by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, to streamline spending and reduce waste. Musk is optimistic about saving billions through cuts, including reductions in public broadcasting budgets and financial support for advocacy groups.However, Trump’s proposed tax cuts, including reducing corporate tax rates to 15%, have drawn criticism. Economists argue these measures may worsen the deficit by favouring the wealthy while reducing government revenue. Jessica Fulton of the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies noted: “Further tax cuts for high-income groups will increase the deficit at a time when fiscal discipline is urgently needed.”Higher interest rates have already strained American households, with the yield on 10-year Treasury notes rising from 0.6% in 2020 to 4.4%. This translates to increased borrowing costs for businesses and individuals, further slowing economic growth.Brian Riedl of the Manhattan Institute criticised the administration’s approach: “Reintroducing tax cuts while the deficit has tripled is fiscally irresponsible.” Many Republican lawmakers now question the viability of Trump’s fiscal agenda given the economic constraints.Trump’s second term presents a delicate challenge: reducing the national debt while implementing his policies, including tax cuts and tariffs. Rising debt servicing costs leave little room for investment in areas like infrastructure or national security.To offset spending, proposals to cut funding for environmental programmes and roll back parts of the Inflation Reduction Act are under consideration, though such moves may face legal and political hurdles.As the debt crisis deepens, political tensions between Democrats and Republicans are expected to escalate. Trump’s approach to handling the debt will not only shape his presidency but also influence America’s economic trajectory for years to come.Despite the challenges, Trump’s team remains optimistic. Transition spokesperson Karoline Leavitt stated: “The American people have given President Trump a mandate to deliver on his promises, including reducing costs. He will deliver.”With the US debt issue at the forefront of national debates, the stakes for Trump’s second term couldn’t be higher. The decisions made now will determine the nation’s economic stability and global standing for decades to come.","America’s debt has ballooned at an alarming pace.

Trump claims Mexico will 'stop' migration; Mexican President says no plan to close border,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/closing-our-southern-border-trump-says-mexican-counterpart-agrees-to-stop-migration/articleshow/115750859.cms,"US President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday announced that Mexico has agreed to ""stop"" migration, effectively closing the US southern border . Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo , however, responded to Trump's claim and said that Mexico's strategy is not to close borders but to build bridges between governments and people.After a telephonic exchange with Pardo, Trump said, ""Just had a wonderful conversation with the new President of Mexico, Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo.""“She has agreed to stop Migration through Mexico, and into the United States, effectively closing our Southern Border,” he added.Pardo, however, did not immediately respond to Trump's remarks and shared brief details of a discussion about migration ""strategy.""""We discussed Mexico's strategy on the migration phenomenon and I shared that caravans are not arriving at the northern border because they are being taken care of in Mexico,"" Sheinbaum said on X.Trump said that he and Sheinbaum Pardo also discussed illegal drugs coming into the US from south of the border during their “very productive conversation.”“We also talked about what can be done to stop the massive drug inflow into the United States, and also, U.S. consumption of these drugs,” he wrote.“It was a very productive conversation!” he added.This comes days after Trump said that he would impose tariffs of 25 percent on Mexican and Canadian imports and 10 percent on goods from China.""This Tariff will remain in effect until such time as Drugs, in particular Fentanyl, and all Illegal Aliens stop this Invasion of our Country!"" Trump wrote on his Truth Social page.Meanwhile, Mexican economy minister Marcelo Ebrard said that almost ""400,000 jobs will be lost"" in the United States if Trump followed through on his threat. He cited a study based on figures from US carmakers that manufacture in Mexico.Ebrard said the tariffs would also hit US consumers hard, citing the US market for pickup trucks, most of which are manufactured in Mexico. The minister said that the tariffs would add $3,000 to the cost of a new vehicle.""The impact of this measure will chiefly be felt by consumers in the United States... That is why we say that it would be a shot in the foot,"" Ebrard told reporters, speaking alongside Sheinbaum at her regular morning conference.Illegal migration was one of the top issues in the recently concluded US presidential elections.Trump vowed to enact the largest deportation in history, starting when he takes the oath of office January 20.Earlier this month, the president-elect confirmed that he would declare a “national emergency” to deport illegal migrants with the help of “military assets” once he steps back into office.","US President-elect Donald Trump announced that Mexico has agreed to ""stop"" migration, effectively closing the US southern border.

Kim Kardashian who is close to Ivanka Trump and was seen speaking with Elon Musk on several occasions dropping enough hints for people to conclude that she has gone MAGA said she did not take money from Tesla to pose with its futuristic robot. Kardashian posted a series of photographs of herself on Instagram and X posing in front of and inside a Tesla Cybercab with an Optimus robot in the driver's seat.A representative for Kardashian told the New York Times that no payments were received in exchange for the posts.Kardashian's connection with the Trumps is not new and the first photo of Ivanka Trump with Kardhasian emerged in 2023 when Kardashian held a birthday celebration at Funke, an Italian restaurant in Beverly Hills, California. The group photograph that Kardashian posted included Lauren Sánchez, the partner of Jeff Bezos, and Ivanka Trump.Ivanka is not in her father's inner circle any more Kardashian still has strong footholds in the MAGA territory.

In 2018, Kardashian, whose father was a prominent attorney and businessman, became involved in an effort to help free Alice Marie Johnson, who was sentenced to life in prison for her involvement in a 1996 cocaine smuggling operation. Kardashian met Donald Trump at the White House where she told him Johnson's story.In 2020, Kim let Trump down after she decided to not endorse any presidential candidate. “I was disappointed in Kim,” Donald Trump said in an interview. “With Kim, I did a lot of prison reform that she couldn’t get done with anybody else.” “I let people out of prison that I thought were deserving to be let out,” he added. “And then after it was all over, she announced that she’s not supporting me. And she only did that to be cool in Hollywood.”In this election too, Kardashian did not endorse any candidate and kept silent after Donald Trump's win.

President-elect Donald Trump Wednesday nominated Keith Kellogg , a retired Army lieutenant general, to serve as special envoy for Ukraine and Russia. ""He was with me right from the beginning! Together, we will secure PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH, and Make America, and the World, SAFE AGAIN!"" Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social.Kellogg, who will also be an assistant to Trump during his second term, has long been a top adviser for the president-elect on defense issues.""Keith has led a distinguished Military and Business career, including serving in highly sensitive National Security roles in my first Administration,"" Trump mentioned on Wednesday. Keith was also the national security advice to Mike Pence who was the vice president in Trump's first term.Kellogg has previously argued that Washington should arm Ukraine on the condition that Kyiv enter peace talks with Russia. Writing in a policy paper alongside another former Trump official, Fred Fleitz, they argued that the US should put Ukrainian NATO membership on hold indefinitely in exchange for a “comprehensive and verifiable deal with security guarantees.”The appointment was a much-awaited one as Trump claimed had he been the president, the Russia-Ukraine war would not have taken place. Trump has criticized the billions of dollars that the Biden administration has poured into Ukraine. Washington has recently stepped up weapons shipments and has forgiven billions in loans provided to Kyiv. The incoming Republican president has said he could end the war in 24 hours, comments that appear to suggest he would press Ukraine to surrender territory that Russia now occupies.Kellogg's plan to end the war, which began when Russia invaded the sovereign territory of Ukraine in February 2022, involves freezing the battle lines at their current locations and forcing Kiev and Moscow to sit down at the negotiating table, according to Reuters.80-year-old Keith Kellogg is married to Paige Kellogg and has three children.

Did David Plouffe delete his X account to avoid questions?



Kamala Harris' senior campaign adviser David Plouffe made an explosive claim that the party's internal polling never showed that the VP was ahead of Donald Trump in September and October. In fact, the internal polling showed her way behind, Plouffe said on Pod Save America podcast. It was the external polling that kept Kamala Harris leading Donald Trump marginally.“We were behind. I mean, I think it surprised people because there were these public polls that came out in late September, early October, showing us with leads that we never saw,” Plouffe said in his first interview since the election loss. The campaign said they just had short time for the campaigning indirectly putting the blame on President Joe Biden.Plouffe said the campaign faced difficulties to find out how to distance Harris from Joe Biden since they were part of the same administration.“Imagine if we said, ‘Well, we would have taken this approach on the border.’ Imagine the round of stories coming out after that of people saying, ‘Well, she never said that in a meeting,’ or ‘What meeting when she said this,’ or ‘I remember when she did that.’ And it was just, it wasn’t going to give us what we needed because it wouldn’t be a clean break.”“It’s always worth reminding people: It’s really hard for Democrats to win battleground states, OK? Let’s look at Pennsylvania: 25 per cent of the electorate is liberal, roughly, 34 per cent is conservative,” Plouffe said. “So in every battleground state, there’s more conservatives than liberals.”“In Pennsylvania, if exits are to be believed, Trump won conservatives 91-8. Harris won Liberals 93–6. Moderates, Harris won 56-43. But you kind of got to win 60 percent of them, right?” Plouffe said. “So, you know, for Democrats to win battleground states, to Quentin and Jen’s point, it is a false choice.”“And I think as we look ahead to ’26 and ’28, particularly where you have seen drift amongst noncollege voters generally, particularly those of color, specifically, you know, we obviously have to get some of that back. We can’t afford any more erosion. The math just doesn’t f‑‑‑ing work, okay?”“But, I don’t think this is a permanent realignment, but the point here is to win battleground states. Yes, of course you have to maximize your turnout and your vote share amongst liberal voters if you’re a Democrat,” he added. “That was a huge focus. You’ve got to win the center.”As the interview came, a viral post claimed that David Plouffe initially deleted his X account so that he didn't have to answer public questions because he was peddling fake data to get funds. ""David Plouffe initially deleted his 𝕏 account, likely so he didn't have to answer public questions about the FAKE data he was peddling to media in the final week, which unsurprisingly, they didn't even bother to confirm, but then the account reappears and now he is admitting on a podcast that not a single poll was legit and that their internal polling NEVER had Harris in the lead, ever and they were forced to lied to donors. It was all a giant scam.

On July 16th, the mission's Visible Emission Line Coronagraph (Velc) instrument captured data allowing scientists to pinpoint the start time of a coronal mass ejection (CME). Studying CMEs, massive bursts of charged particles from the Sun's outer layer, is a key goal of the mission.“Made up of charged particles, a CME could weigh up to a trillion kilograms and can attain a speed of up to 3,000km [1,864 miles] per second while travelling. It can head out in any direction, including towards the Earth,” explained Professor R Ramesh of the Indian Institute of Astrophysics , who designed Velc.He further stated, “Now imagine this huge fireball hurtling towards Earth. At its top speed, it would take just about 15 hours to cover the 150 million km Earth-Sun distance.”The observed CME began at 13:08 GMT and initially moved towards Earth before changing direction. While this particular CME posed no threat, solar storms and CMEs can disrupt Earth's magnetic field, affecting satellites, power grids, and communication systems. The mission aims to provide early warnings of these events. Aditya-L1 joins other space agencies like NASA and ESA in solar observation. Its unique vantage point allows constant solar monitoring, even during eclipses.Professor Ramesh highlighted Velc’s ability to mimic a total solar eclipse, allowing it to continuously observe the Sun's corona. This offers an advantage over other coronagraphs which may obscure parts of the corona.“But with Velc, we can precisely estimate the time a coronal mass ejection begins and in which direction it’s headed,” he stated.Combining Aditya-L1's data with observations from India's ground-based observatories is expected to improve our understanding of the Sun.","India's Aditya-L1 solar mission has achieved its first major result, providing data that could protect Earth's infrastructure from future solar activity.

Trump picks Covid lockdown contrarian Dr Jay Bhattacharya to lead NIH,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-picks-covid-lockdown-contrarian-dr-jay-bhattacharya-to-lead-nih/articleshow/115740910.cms,"Dr Jay Bhattacharya

TOI correspondent from Washington:

US President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday chose Kolkata-born and Stanford-trained physician Jay Bhattacharya , a Covid lockdown contrarian , to head the US National Institutes of Health (NIH). With a budget of nearly $50 billion spread across 27 centers and facilities of different biomedical disciplines, it is the nation's premier public health research institution.In a statement he posted on his SoMe platform, Trump said Dr Bhattacharya ""will work in cooperation with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (his health secretary pick) to direct the Nation’s Medical Research, and to make important discoveries that will improve Health, and save lives,” adding, “Together, Jay and RFK Jr will restore the NIH to a Gold Standard of Medical Research as they examine the underlying causes of, and solutions to, America’s biggest health challenges, including our Crisis of Chronic Illness and Disease.""Dr Bhattacharya gained prominence in 2021 when he opposed lockdowns and mask mandates as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, going against the mainstream official groupthink. In what was called the Great Barrington Declaration he co-authored with another Kolkata-born epidemiologist Sunetra Gupta and Martin Kulldorff, they advocated lifting COVID-19 restrictions on lower-risk groups to develop herd immunity, while advocating protection for vulnerable people.The approach was widely panned by establishment principals who called the shots, including WHO, but it found support in the MAGA constituency and the business community that was bristling at the government mandated shutdowns. Bhattacharya had met Trump in the White House during the Covid crisis to argue against the lockdowns, but like much of America and the world, the first-term President was also in thrall of Dr Antony Fauci's prescription of shutdowns and mask mandates, backed by then NIH Director Francis Collins.The clash between the two approaches rages to this day, with Dr Bhattacharya's choice setting off a firestorm in public health circles where one critic likened his appointment (and that of his putative boss Robert Kennedy Jr) to ""flat earthers given charge of NASA."" ""Jay Bhattacharya is an unwise pick for NIH. He’s combative, often unkind, & a scientific iconoclast. The Barrington Declaration caused needless deaths. But he’s qualified & has a record of accomplishment in academia & research. It rounds out a health team on the fringe of science,"" noted Lawrence Gostin, a Harvard professor specialising in public health law.In a statement, Bhattacharya said he is honored and humbled by Trump's nomination and pledged ""to reform American scientific institutions so that they are worthy of trust again and will deploy the fruits of excellent science to make America healthy again!""Trump also announced several other health-care appointments, including Johns Hopkins surgeon Marty Makary as his FDA commissioner, former GOP congressman Dave Weldon to lead Center for Disease Control and Janette Nesheiwat, a family and emergency medicine physician, to replace Vivek Murthy as the next U.S. surgeon general. All positions will need senate confirmation.Founded in 1887 and headquartered just outside Washington DC in Bethesda, Maryland, NIH has a storied history that includes the discovery of what is now regarded as basic knowledge (such as tooth decay is caused by bacteria) to the first trial of gene therapy in humans. It has a large number of Indian-origin researchers and scientists and a long history of collaboration with Indian institutions, including supporting research on HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, rotavirus, cancer and other diseases.","Kolkata-born and Stanford-trained physician Jay Bhattacharya to head the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) With a budget of nearly $50 billion spread across 27 centers and facilities of different biomedical disciplines, it is the nation's premier public health research institution.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115741036,imgsize-544163,width-400,resizemode-4/115741036.jpg"

(Reuters)

ISLAMABAD: At least eight supporters of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) were killed and dozens of others injured in Islamabad following what the party said was a sweeping crackdown overnight by security forces to disperse protesters demanding the release of jailed former prime minister and PTI chief Imran Khan Following the crackdown, Imran’s party ended its agitation but Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur addressed a press conference in his province on Wednesday saying the protest would go on. “Until Imran Khan’s call, this sit-in will go on,” he said without elaborating where it would be held. PTI has been in govt in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.Thousands of demonstrators, led by Imran’s wife Bushra Bibi, and Gandapur, had gathered in the capital on Tuesday vowing to stage a sit-in until their demands were met, including the release of political prisoners. Khan and many other PTI leaders and workers have been in jail for over a year on charges that they claim are politically motivated.Security forces launched a massive crackdown before midnight Tuesday after failing to stop protesters from marching to D-Chowk, a public square in Islamabad’s high-security red zone. In the evening authorities forced surrounding stores, cafes and markets to shut and then plunged the protest venue into darkness by switching off streetlights. Eyewitnesses said indiscriminate firing and teargas shelling, which started after 11pm and continued for about two hours, forced the PTI supporters, mostly Pashtuns from the northwest, to retreat.PTI claimed eight of its supporters had died in the late-night clashes and “hundreds” more were feared to have been killed. The govt stated three paramilitary troops and one policeman had died since the PTI launched its protest on Sunday. Islamabad’s police chief told media more than 900 people had been arrested in Tuesday’s raid, in which there were dozens of Afghan nationals.Sources at Islamabad’s two public hospitals said five civilians had died of gunshot wounds and dozens had been injured. According to PTI workers, they had picked up three bodies from the protest site.Information minister Attaullah Tarar said the protesters had fled in disarray, leaving behind vehicles, and even their shoes and clothes.PTI said in a post on social media that a “massacre has unfolded in Pakistan at the hands of security forces”. It accused the armed security forces of launching a violent assault on peaceful PTI protesters, firing live rounds with the intent to kill as many people as possible. It went on to compare last night’s clashes to the violence in the then East Pakistan in 1971. “The rulers have learned nothing from history and are prepared to destroy the country to cling to their illegitimate power,” the post stated. “With hundreds dead and countless injured, the interior minister’s threat to kill, and then the declaration of ‘victory’ over slaughtered innocents is enough evidence of the regime’s inhumanity,” it added.On Wednesday morning, the heavily fortified red zone was empty of protesters but dozens of smashed vehicles, including the charred remains of a truck from which Imran’s wife had been leading the protest, portrayed a grim picture.",At least eight supporters of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) were killed and dozens of others injured in Islamabad.

Bushra Bibi , the wife of former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan , is leading protests demanding his release from jail. At least five people have died in the resulting violence.Khan supporters, led by Bushra Bibi, marched in various locations, including D-Chowk in Islamabad. A planned rally on November 24 was prevented by an Islamabad High Court order citing the visit of Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko and a new public order law. Protests also occurred globally.Speaking to PTI workers, Bibi said, ""This is not just about my husband; it is about this country and its leader."" Addressing a rally, she added, ""Until Imran Khan is with us, we will not end this protest. I will remain here until my last breath, and I ask all of you to stand by us. This isn’t just about my husband. It’s about the future of our country and the leadership we deserve.""Khan was ousted in a no-trust motion in 2022 and has been imprisoned since. Bushra and Khan are now facing terrorism charges related to the November 24 protest. Bushra, who typically wears traditional Islamic attire covering her face, has become more politically active since Khan's imprisonment.Bushra Bibi, the wife of former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan, is facing several legal challenges, including a corruption case and a complaint filed by her ex-husband.Bibi, who married Khan in 2018, was recently released on bail after serving part of a 14-year sentence. She alleged attempts to poison her food while incarcerated. She and Khan were jailed and fined $2 million each in a corruption case related to state gifts. Khan and Bibi face approximately 200 legal cases following his removal from office.Bibi’s ex-husband, Khawar Maneka, is pursuing a case against her related to their divorce. Maneka, the son of a former minister, alleges a “fraudulent marriage.” His “fornication” claim was rejected. The case centers on whether Bibi observed the required waiting period before remarrying under Islamic law. Bibi and Maneka were married for 28 years and have five children.Bibi, approximately 50 years old, is known as a spiritual guide and faith healer. Khan has described her as a spiritual guide. Prior to marrying Khan, Bibi was married to Maneka and was known as Bushra Maneka. She is a follower of Sufism and a devotee of the Sufi mystic poet Baba Farid.Khan stated in 2018 that he did not see Bibi’s face until after their marriage. “In a rare, and till then the only TV interview in October 2018, she dismissed this as bunkum,” regarrumors that she had foreseen Khan’s prime ministership in a dream.","Imran Khan's wife, Bushra Bibi, is leading protests demanding his release from jail.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan deployed its army within the nation's capital on Tuesday with orders to shoot protesters if necessary, as deadly clashes escalated between the police and supporters of former PM Imran Khan.The govt said four paramilitary rangers and two policemen were killed late Monday and over 100 security personnel injured in the violence, as thousands of protesters marched to Islamabad to demand Khan's release from prison. PM Shehbaz Sharif blamed the protesters for the soldiers' deaths, accusing them of ramming the paramilitary troops with a convoy of vehicles. ""It is not a peaceful protest. It is extremism,"" he said in a statement, aimed at achieving ""evil political designs"".Zulfikar Bukhari, spokesman for Khan's party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), denied Sharif's accusation and claimed that two protesters had been killed and 30 more injured in the clashes, the worst political violence seen in months in the nation of 241 million people. One of the protesters was shot dead and the other was run over by a vehicle, Bukhari said. Authorities did not reply to a query seeking to confirm the deaths.Meanwhile, Amnesty International said the govt must fully protect the rights of protesters and rescind ""shoot-on-sight"" orders that it said gave undue and excessive powers to military.Khan's supporters dismantled roadblocks that had been put in place to stop them while patriotic songs blared from vehicles. Some danced in front of the slow-moving convoy, some chanting, ""Revolution! Revolution!"" When they reached the square late afternoon, some chanted ""Prisoner Number 804"" - a reference to Khan - while others climbed atop shipping containers that had been set up to block their advance.PTI workers, many of them brandishing slingshots and sticks, engaged security personnel in combat as they attempted to make way to D-Chowk, a central square in front of parliament located close to key govt buildings such as the presidency, the PM office, and the supreme court.

Govt tightens restrictions

Islamabad has become the centre of escalating unrest as thousands of supporters of jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan marched into Pakistan's capital, clashing violently with security forces. The protests, driven by the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, have led to six deaths, including four security personnel, and prompted the deployment of the Pakistan Army under Article 245 of the Constitution, with shoot-on-sight orders being issued, ARY news reported.Security forces have struggled to contain the protesters, who broke through barricades and flooded the Red Zone—a fortified area housing key government buildings. The demonstrations turned deadly when a vehicle in the convoy rammed into security personnel, killing four Rangers.To manage the situation, Islamabad's roads have been blocked with shipping containers, schools remain shut, and mobile internet services have been suspended. Tear gas and warning shots have been used to disperse crowds, but the PTI has vowed to press on until Khan is released. PTI leader Bushra Bibi has urged demonstrators to remain peaceful but resolute, saying, “The march will not end until Imran Khan is free.”The unrest stems from PTI’s demand for the immediate release of Imran Khan, who has been in prison since August 2023, convicted in multiple graft cases. PTI supporters argue the charges are politically motivated and claim the current government, led by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who they allege came to power through rigged elections.The United States has expressed concern over the deteriorating situation in Pakistan, urging restraint from all sides. US State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller stated, “We call on protesters to demonstrate peacefully and refrain from violence, and at the same time, we call on Pakistani authorities to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms.”The government has tightened restrictions, banning gatherings and limiting travel between cities. Travel between Islamabad and other cities has become nearly impossible due to shipping containers blocking roads, and all educational institutions have been closed. Mobile internet services and messaging platforms are experiencing significant disruptions in the capital.Police have arrested over 4,000 supporters of Khan since Friday and suspended mobile and internet services in certain areas of the country. On Thursday, a court issued a ban on rallies in the capital, with Naqvi stating that anyone who defied the order would be arrested.","Protests led by Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party have led to six deaths, including four security personnel.

When Khan invoked Tipu Sultan to announce protests



What is Bushra Bibi's Saudi Arabia connection



With over hundreds of supporters of jailed ex-PM Imran Khan marching towards Islamabad, Pakistan is voicing its dissent against the current Shehbaz Sharif government demanding the release of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leader.The government is determined to suppress the protest with force, which was initially set for November 24. However, the convoys paused overnight after PTI leaders announced they were ""in no hurry"" to reach the federal capital for their high-stakes protest. Meanwhile, workers and supporters from across the country have been attempting to defy arrests, baton charges, and tear gas as they join the demonstration.The United States urged both Pakistani authorities and the thousands of protesters marching on the capital to exercise restraint in their actions.""We call on protesters to demonstrate peacefully and refrain from violence and, at the same time, we call on Pakistani authorities to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms and to ensure respect for Pakistan's laws and constitution as they work to maintain law and order,"" state department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters.The protests, so far, have seen the death of a cop, with several people being injured on both the sides. Internet and mobile services have been shut down as the government is adamant to suppress this “well-thought-out conspiracy.”Over 1,257 party workers have been detained, and nearly 200 arrested while attempting to march towards Islamabad in response to the party’s call for action, according to ARY news.In a rallying call to the nation, Imran Khan declared November 24 as the day to ""break free from slavery,"" emphasizing the suspension of the rule of law, the constitution, and human rights in the country.“November 24th is the day to break free from slavery. The rule of law, constitution, and human rights are suspended in Pakistan, forcing the nation to come out to protest and make sacrifices. The nation must decide whether to wear the yoke of slavery like Bahadur Shah Zafar or to adorn the crown of freedom like Tipu Sultan,"" he said in a post on X.The former prime minister has claimed that his imprisonment is part of a political strategy orchestrated by the military and the ruling government to prevent him from regaining power. Khan and his PTI party have also alleged widespread rigging in the February elections, where they assert they won the popular vote, and are now calling for free and fair elections.Multiple cases have been filed in Pakistan's Punjab province against Bushra Bibi, the wife of Imran Khan, religious hatred, misleading the public, and attacking the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia through her statements, which Khan claims was ""deliberately taken out of context.""At least four cases were registered under the Telegraph Act of 1885 and other legal provisions following a video statement in which, Bibi claimed that the problems faced by her husband began after his visit to Madina, where he was seen exiting his plane without shoes.“Soon after Khan’s return, former army chief Bajwa started getting calls Ye tum kya utha key ley aaye ho (whom have you brought)? We are ending the Sharia system in this country and you have brought promoters of Sharia,” she said in the video.Defying these accusations, Khan said, ""Bushra Bibi's statement was deliberately taken out of context to draw our brotherly country KSA into a needless controversy. She didn't mention Saudi Arabia at all.""The ruled and the ruler coming face to face is a deja vu for South Asia with Bangladesh recently witnessing the ousting of its serving PM Sheikh Hasina, who fled to India after massive violent protests marred the streets of Indian neighbour.","Hundreds of supporters of jailed ex-PM Imran Khan are marching towards Islamabad. They are demanding the release of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leader. The government is determined to suppress the protest with force.

Islamabad PTI Protest: Tens of thousands of PTI protesters reach outskirts of Islamabad,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/tens-of-thousands-of-pti-protesters-reach-outskirts-of-islamabad/articleshow/115669575.cms,"The anti-government 'Final Call' protest rally of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), that started from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Peshawar on Sunday, has now reached the outskirts of Islamabad where massive security arrangements have been made to prevent its entry into the country's capital.

ISLAMABAD: Amid fierce teargas clashes with law enforcement personnel, tens of thousands of protesters of the Imran Khan-led Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) reached the outskirts of the capital, Islamabad, on Monday to demand the release of their incarcerated party chief, with his wife Bushra Bibi saying the demonstration would continue until the former PM was released from jail.Vowing not to allow the protest, the govt has blocked all routes into and out of Islamabad with shipping containers, and heavy contingents of police and other security forces have been deployed across the capital city. The protesters, however, intend to set up camp at Islamabad D-Chowk, a large square near a number of significant govt buildings, including the PM’s office, parliament and the Supreme Court.Imran has billed the ongoing protest as the “final call” to meet three demands — his release from jail, along with hundreds of party workers who were detained over the last two years, reversal of the 26th Constitutional Amendment which curtailed the powers of the judiciary, and the return of the “stolen mandate” of the Feb 8 elections.A convoy of protesters from the south-western province of Balochistan, which has travelled for four days and includes women and children, has been waiting at Islamabad’s entry point for other convoys to reach and then collectively march to the capital. “We are waiting for the main convoy, led by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa CM Ali Amin Gandapur, to arrive,” said Shahjehan Bazai, a PTI supporter. Imran’s wife has been part of the convoy led by Gandapur.“As long as Imran is not with us, we will not end this march,” she told supporters at a stop near the Hazara Interchange. “I will stay there till my last breath, and all of you have to support me. This is not just about my husband but about the country and its leader,” said Bushra, who was sentenced alongside Khan in Jan but released on bail in late Oct.Tensions between the two sides escalated into violence on Monday when thousands of people resumed their march towards the capital. Clashes erupted in the city’s suburbs, with footage showing PTI supporters setting police vehicles ablaze and hurling stones. Police shot tear gas at protesters who responded with slingshots.The party claimed that many of its members have been arrested in crackdowns across Pakistan. “We have already detained more than 4,000 Khan supporters, including five parliamentarians,” said Shahid Nawaz, a senior police officer in eastern Punjab.Pakistan interior minister Mohsin Naqvi said authorities would arrest more of Khan’s supporters if they reach Islamabad’s Red Zone (D-Chowk), which has been sealed off. “Anyone reaching it will be arrested,” he said.The protest, which govt is determined to foil with force, was originally scheduled to be staged on Nov 24, but the convoys took a breather last night after PTI leaders said they were in “no hurry” to reach the federal capital for their “do or die” protest as workers and supporters from across the country attempted to defy arrests, baton charges and tear gas to participate in the agitation.","Tens of thousands of protesters of the Imran Khan-led Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) reached the outskirts of the capital, Islamabad, on Monday.

Hundreds of supporters of jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan converged on the outskirts of Pakistan’s capital, Islamabad, on Monday, demanding his release and vowing to march on parliament for a sit-in protest.Authorities imposed a strict security lockdown, erecting barricades on highways to block the demonstrators, as Khan’s party reported clashes and unrest in other parts of the country. As the protests continue, one policeman has been reported killed. Numerous individuals from both sides have also sustained injuries during violent confrontations between Imran Khan's followers and security personnel near Islamabad on Monday. The casualties were confirmed by both a government minister and representatives from Khan's political party, according to Reuters.In regards to the protest, in an update provided Monday evening, PTI said that the convoy from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa entered Islamabad while others are expected to reach as soon as the obstacles clear.""The convoy of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa entered the limits of Islamabad! Convoys are reaching Islamabad from all over Pakistan. We did not stop until we reached Islamabad,"" said PTI. ""Where there are obstacles, as soon as they are removed, those caravans will again leave for Islamabad. These caravans will hit Islamabad like tsunami waves every day. This will continue until we win Khan's demands and the war for true freedom. We will not stop, we will not bend. We will persist. And will remain steadfast. Will die freed!"" added the party.Khan’s wife Bushra Bibi, also a part of the march, addressed the rally near Hazara Interchange saying, “My brothers, we will not end this march till Imran is not with us,” she said. “I will stay there till my last breath, and all of you have to support me. This is not just about my husband but about the country and its leader.”The procession is being headed by KP Chief Minister Amin Ali Gandapur. Several PTI officials, including Sanam Javaid Khan, Babar Saleem Swati, Faisal Javed, and Omar Ayub Khan were also part of the demonstration.Speaking to Dawn.com at Attock's Burhan Interchange, PTI's Shaukat Yousafzai confirmed the advancing convoys, noting their slow progress due to size and obstacles. He claimed police retreated upon seeing the “huge rally.” Yousafzai confirmed Gandapur’s intention to reach D-Chowk “peacefully but at any cost.” He added that the party would continue its protest until “innocent political prisoners,” including Khan, are released. Yousafzai criticized the government as incompetent, focused only on “baton-charge the public and block the roads.”PTI’s Barrister Gohar also affirmed the protest would continue. “This is Khan sahib’s final call, there is no such thing of calling this off,” he stated. Roads leading to Islamabad’s red zone, except for Margalla Road, are blocked.Punjab Information Minister Azma Bukhari questioned the effectiveness of the protest. “In this ‘final call’ […] I don’t think there will be a bigger disappointment than this,” she remarked. Bukhari noted approximately 80 arrests were made during Sunday’s protests in Punjab.The protest, initially scheduled for November 24, was delayed. The Islamabad High Court ruled the protest unlawful and directed the government to maintain order, especially with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko’s arrival in Islamabad for a three-day visit. PTI leader Asad Qaiser said the march would take a few days to reach Islamabad.Police used tear gas against protesters near Attock, who responded by throwing stones and setting a toll booth and van on fire. However, PTI brought large industrial fans to counteract tear gas. Ikram Khattana, PTI’s social media head in KP, said six locally manufactured fans are part of the Peshawar convoy, as reported by Dawn.The administration remains firm on preventing protesters from entering Islamabad. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi announced arrests for any attempting entry. Deputy PM Ishaq Dar called the protest a “well-thought out conspiracy,” noting its timing coincided with Lukashenko’s visit.Additionally, provincial Information Minister Uzma Bukhari, whilst confirming that authorities had detained approximately 80 of Khan's followers said, ""We wouldn't let them storm the capital.""The demonstration, which Khan termed as the ""final call"", represents one of numerous rallies organised by his party advocating for his freedom since his imprisonment in August last year. Their previous demonstration in Islamabad in early October resulted in unrest.Khan, who was removed from power through a parliamentary vote in 2022 following disagreements with Pakistan's influential military establishment, faces various accusations including corruption and incitement to violence, all of which he and his party consistently reject.","Hundreds of supporters of jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan converged on the outskirts of Pakistan’s capital, Islamabad, on Monday.

Khan has been behind bars for more than a year and has over 150 criminal cases against him.

They include five parliamentarians. Pakistan has sealed off Islamabad with shipping containers and shut down major roads and highways connecting the city with PTI strongholds in Punjab and northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces.

""Internet and mobile services will continue to operate as usual in the rest of the country,"" the posts said.The govt is imposing social media platform bans and targeting VPN services, according to internet advocacy group Netblocks. On Sunday, the group said live metrics showed problems with WhatsApp that were affecting media sharing on the app. Khan's supporters rely heavily on social media to demand his release and use messaging platforms like WhatsApp to share information.PTI spokesman Sheikh Waqas Akram said Khan's wife Bushra Bibi was travelling to Islamabad in a convoy led by the CM of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Ali Amin Gandapur. ""She cannot leave the party workers on their own,"" said Akram.

Bangladesh govt labelled Iskcon as a ""religious fundamentalist organisation"" whilst responding to a High Court writ petition seeking its ban on Wednesday.Framing of Iskcon as a “fundamentalist organisation” and seeking its prohibition came amid a wave of protests triggered by the arrest of Das, amplifying tensions in a nation grappling with rising religious discord.Attorney General Md. Asaduzzaman, representing the government, described ISKCON as a “religious fundamentalist organization” during the court proceedings. This characterization came under intense scrutiny, with ISKCON’s leadership and global Hindu organizations vehemently refuting the allegations. The High Court has directed the government to provide a comprehensive report on ISKCON and the broader law and order situation by Thursday.Madhu Pandit Das , ISKCON's president, appealed to both the Bangladeshi and Indian governments for intervention, urging the release of Chinmoy Das and the protection of minority communities. “We are a peace-loving Bhakti movement. Such allegations undermine our humanitarian efforts and global reputation,” he said.The Iskcon president said: “It is outrageous to make baseless allegations that ISKCON has anything to do with terrorism anywhere in the world. ISKCON urges the Government of India to take immediate steps and speak to the Government of Bangladesh and convey that we are a peace-loving Bhakti movement.

Ensuring justice and fair treatment for him is crucial,” the statement said.ISKCON also demanded the identification and accountability of perpetrators behind recent attacks on Hindus and called for robust measures to protect the civil rights of all minority members.The situation for Hindus, who make up about 8% of Bangladesh's 170 million population, has become increasingly worrying.

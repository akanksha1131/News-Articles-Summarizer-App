‘Killer Kristi!’ chants ring out in Manhattan

‘ICE Cold Killers’ signs as outrage spreads





A fatal shooting by an ICE officer in south Minneapolis has triggered outrage far beyond Minnesota, with large protests breaking out in New York City and demonstrators openly condemning Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.The woman who was killed has been identified by city officials as 37-year-old Renee Nicole Macklin Good, a US citizen who had moved to the Twin Cities from the Kansas City area. Officials said Good was acting as a legal observer of federal activity and was not the target of any ICE arrest.The shooting happened Wednesday morning at East 34th Street and Portland Avenue, just blocks from where George Floyd was murdered by a Minneapolis police officer in 2020, a killing that sparked weeks of protests across the US and around the world.According to the Department of Homeland Security, the ICE agent’s actions were justified. Federal officials described the woman’s actions before the shooting as an “act of domestic terrorism.” Local officials, however, say video recorded by witnesses contradicts that account and have called for ICE to leave the city.The incident occurred as DHS flooded the area with more than 2,000 officers as part of what it described as one of its largest immigration enforcement operations so far, under the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.The Minneapolis shooting quickly set off protests nationwide. In New York City, demonstrators gathered at Foley Square early Wednesday before marching to One World Trade Center, where Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was speaking about ongoing ICE operations, according to local media reports.By Thursday night, the crowd at Foley Square had grown larger than the night before, with heightened tensions bringing out more protesters, and a heavier police presence, both in the square and across the street at 26 Federal Plaza.Earlier in the day, around 200 protesters marched from Foley Square to 1 World Trade Center in an attempt to confront Noem directly. As she defended the actions of the ICE agent who shot Good, demonstrators in downtown Manhattan chanted “Killer Kristi!”“Go to hell, Kristi Noem!” protesters yelled.In New York, a crowd of roughly 300 people carried signs reading “ICE Cold Killers” and “ICE is Trump’s Gestapo.” The demonstrations were part of a broader wave of protests condemning ICE operations and the federal government’s handling of the shooting.Local officials in Minneapolis have continued to push back against the federal government’s account, saying eyewitness video undermines DHS claims and demanding answers, and accountability, for Good’s death.","A fatal shooting by an ICE officer in Minneapolis has triggered outrage far beyond Minnesota.

Netizens react to the video

Why does it matter?





Renee Good, a 37-year-old poet and mother was fatally killed by an ICE officer on January 7, 2026. The Minneapolis woman was driving an SUV when she was confronted by the agency's officials and was shot through her car window by one officer. The video of the brutal incident went viral on the internet, exposing the reality of the Trump administration's Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, leading to protests and calls for ICE to leave the city.A video of a woman attending a memorial for Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis on Thursday, has gone viral on X. ""It feels kind of wrong being here, in some way,"" she began. ""I don’t know where that stems from. Part of it is being a White woman. I am privileged. I have a lot of privilege. So I feel like my tears are not something that's necessary when black and brown people have been experiencing this. For a long time. This isn't new for them. I don’t know if that makes any sense,"" she told journalist Brecca Stoll of The Daily Wire, a conservative-leaning outlet, when asked why she feels wrong for showing up at the memorial.When asked about how she decided to show up for the memorial, she said: ""Well, I work two miles from here.So, driving by, two miles, I can stop.""The video was posted on the social media app by @Breaking911 and has received 5.4M views and 26K likes as of now. It sparked a debate in the comments section, reflecting various views on race in the United States at a time when immigrants are being targeted by the Trump administration.“If you have a person who thinks like this in your life please do what you can to help free them from their identitarian anxieties. White people should grieve and cry. You should not racialise your tears as a general matter,” wrote Tim Miller, former Republican strategist, on X.“Woke ideology has sent people literally bonkers,” wrote journalist Piers Morgan.""This is honestly more disrespectful than me just saying I don't care,"" wrote an X user.""Leftism, the ideology where you can literally give your life for the cause and still be derided for being white,"" added another.""America wasn't THIS racist since after Obama and before the Civil Rights movement,"" one pointed out.""EVEN GRIEF IS RADICALISEDThis is where the left has landed in 2026 A woman shows up to pay her respects to Renee Good — and instead of acting like a normal human being, she spirals into racial self-flagellation,"" added one.The fatal and shocking shooting of Good has sent America into a spiral. On one side are people finally grappling with the reality of the brutal atrocities performed by ICE ever since Trump's second term began in January 2025. On the other hand, extremists are justifying the act by blaming the Good herself for her untimely death.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has alleged that she sought to weaponise her vehicle against the ICE officer and that he feared for his life. However, critics have pointed out that the video footage of the shooting showed that Good was attempting to drive away and escape the situation and that the shooting was unnecessary.As the investigation has been taken over by the FBI, ICE continues to face large opposition from protestors across the states who have been privy to the agency's atrocities and shootings for a year now.","Renee Good, a 37-year-old poet and mother was fatally killed by an ICE officer on January 7, 2026.

Vivek Ramaswamy’s old take on caste surfaces on Twitter after he quits social media,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/vivek-ramaswamys-old-take-on-caste-surfaces-on-twitter-after-he-quits-social-media/articleshow/126443298.cms,"Usha Vance J**t Slur Sparks Firestorm: Vivek Ramaswamy’s Outburst Splits MAGA | ‘You Have No Place…’

How social media takes things out of context

America's evolving caste debate





Current Ohio gubernatorial candidate and former Republican presidential candidate, Vivek Ramaswamy recently went into a social media exile, announcing his decision to quit his personal social media accounts on X (Formerly Twitter) and Instagram. Citing the reasons that modern social media is becoming ""increasingly disconnected from the electorate"" and the messages being ""negative and bombastic,"" he shared the decision in an op-ed published in The Wall Street Journal on Monday.At the same time, an excerpt from his 2021 book 'Woke, Inc.: Inside Corporate America's Social Justice Scam' has resurfaced on Twitter and has been circulating all over the social media app. A post on the app, shared a photo of the excerpt written back in the day, highlighting Ramaswamy's description of Indian caste society and his experience with it. What followed was a familiar social media cycle: selective emphasis, rising outrage, and a narrative that quickly hardened into accusation.""Did you know that @VivekGRamaswamy was born into the highest caste of Indian, so special even royalty is below him? That his childhood servants can't walk through the same doors as him? That he wears a magic rope ""Poonal"" so he can be special even when naked?,"" called out the post, inciting numerous X users into criticising the politician.The post, which has received 94.3K views on the social media app, had parts of the excerpt strategically underlined to create a narrative where Ramaswamy boasted of himself being Brahmin, the highest caste in the Hindu society and that the people who provided service to his family were of the lower caste and entered the house through different gates. That every person who was a part of the society understood its values and principles. It portrays Ramaswamy as an extremely proud casteist, thus leading to comments such as: ""talking about discrimination with zero knowledge"" and "" Vivek is quite literally the worst type of human.""The book which the excerpt belongs to was published back in 2021 and was Ramaswamy's debut as an author. What the post described as a casteist lens is actually an attempt to explain a larger subject through a more comprehensible and personal anecdote.'Woke, Inc.' is a book about American corporate identity politics and caste is used as an illustrative example, not the subject. In the writing, Ramaswamy clearly explains how hierarchy does not always align with wealth or power across societies.He gives the example of an Indian society, mentioning the four castes, Brahmins the priests, Kshatriyas the kings, Vaishyas the commercial class and Shudras the service caste.He added that caste was a description of social and occupational hierarchy. Brahmins were obligated to pursue knowledge, which didn't come with money or political power. Thus, his grandfather worked as a farm manager, his father as an engineer and his uncle as a doctor. Social customs required the caste to wear a sacred string, Poonal, which was a cultural marker of caste, not a symbol of power.He shared the anecdote of his domestic help who lived with them like relatives and was respected just like family members, unbeknownst as a child that they belonged to a said lower caste. The distinction, he argues, was social rather than economic, a legacy of inherited norms rather than personal animus.It was these social values that led to the formation of rules. They were unfair, but for the people at the time they were associated with a 'proper understanding of the world'.Higher social rank did not mean an escape from the economic troubles for anyone who was a part of the society. The excerpt was a description, not the norm. But reading only the underlined parts of it could have anyone carrying a brick and walking towards the political leader.Numerous times social media screenshots are taken out of context, especially when they are targeted at non-Indian audiences who lack the social context. Explanations are reduced to screenshots, writings to advocacy and context disappears.Caste has become politicised in parts of the US, especially California. Back in 2023, Senate Bill 403 or SB403 was passed by the state legislature to explicitly ban caste discrimination. Although the bill was vetoed by Governor Gavin Newsom, it reflected growing concern about caste dynamics within South Asian immigrant communities, by adding caste as a protected class to the state's existing anti-discrimination laws.The same year Seattle became the first US city to outlaw caste discrimination with followed by Fresno. As per activists, the issue is more prominent in Americans of Indian descent and Hindus. Since most of them move to Silicon Valley and California, these places confront the issue of caste discrimination.But is it true? A 2018 report from Equality Labs, a California-based non-profit, stated that 25% of Dalit respondents said they had faced verbal or physical assault based on their caste; 50% of Dalits live in fear of their caste being outed; 67% reported being treated unfairly at their workplace.However, the survey was web-based, self-reported, and conducted among respondents already engaged with anti-caste advocacy.By contrast, a report by the Carnegie Foundation and YouGov, found only 1% of Hindu Indian Americans who identified themselves with a caste were Dalit. 80% of Hindus in America who identified with a caste, are upper caste. Of those Indian Americans who are Hindu, 50% have almost no friends from the same caste as themselves. Thus, caste is not how they self-segregate or identify each other.It is acts like these which substantiate Ramaswamy's quitting of social media. Circulating an old excerpt without proper clarification attempts to feed into the ""caste war"" narratives and makes social media a negative and bombastic place, as he described.This is not about the current situation of India or about Ramaswamy's current views and opinions. It is about how context can be distorted to manufacture conflict—particularly between cultures—through selective framing.","Ohio gubernatorial candidate and former Republican presidential candidate, Vivek Ramaswamy, quit his social media accounts on X (Formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

US Doomsday nuclear plane spotted in Washington: Why is it called the 'flying Pentagon',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/etimes/trending/us-doomsday-nuclear-plane-spotted-in-washington-why-is-it-called-the-flying-pentagon/articleshow/126445792.cms,"



What the “Doomsday Plane” actually is

What makes Doomsday Plane special and why was it spotted for first time in 51 years in Los Angeles? The US Air Force E-4B Nightwatch landing at Los Angeles International Airport sparks public attention. Pic Credit: X/@JeffVaughn

Inside the airborne command centre





Why the flight drew attention





Boeing E-4B Nightwatch, better known as the US military’s “Doomsday Plane,” made a rare and highly visible appearance this week, triggering speculation because of both its flight pattern and the geopolitical moment in which it occurred.Flight-tracking data showed the aircraft departing Offutt Air Force Base on January 6, flying to Camp Springs, Maryland, near Washington, DC, before later landing at Los Angeles International Airport. Videos of the landing circulated widely online, drawing attention precisely because the E-4B is designed to avoid public visibility.The aircraft is not part of routine executive travel, and its movements are rarely discussed. That alone made the flight noteworthy.US media later reported that Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth was aboard the aircraft. The Pentagon has not explained why the E-4B was used instead of a conventional government aircraft, nor has it offered details about the mission profile of the flight.The lack of official explanation has been a familiar feature of past E-4B movements, and part of what gives the aircraft its mystique.The E-4B Nightwatch serves as the National Airborne Operations Center, a flying command post designed to keep the US government functioning during the most extreme scenarios imaginable, including nuclear war, catastrophic attacks on US soil, or the destruction of ground-based command centres.Built on a heavily modified Boeing 747-200 airframe, the aircraft is hardened against electromagnetic pulse effects, shielded against nuclear and thermal radiation, and equipped with multiple layers of secure communications. It is a core component of the military’s Nuclear Command, Control and Communications system, often referred to as NC3, which enables senior leaders to authorize and manage nuclear forces under all conditions.Today’s E-4B fleet traces its origins to the E-4A, which entered service in the late 1970s. The first B-model aircraft was delivered to the US Air Force in January 1980, and by 1985 all aircraft had been converted to the upgraded configuration still in use today. All four E-4Bs are assigned to the 595th Command and Control Group at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska, which has operated under Eighth Air Force since October 2016.At least one aircraft is kept on continuous alert at all times. Each E-4B has a maximum takeoff weight of 800,000 pounds (around 360,000 kilograms), an unrefuelled endurance of roughly 12 hours, and an operating ceiling above 30,000 feet (about 9,091 metres). Designed to function as a flying government, it can carry up to 111 personnel, including senior command staff, intelligence teams and communications specialists. Each aircraft cost approximately $223.2 million in fiscal 1998 dollars, and despite entering service more than four decades ago, the E-4B remains a core component of US continuity-of-government planning.The main deck is divided into six functional areas, including command workspaces, conference and briefing rooms, an operations floor, communications hubs, and rest areas. Up to 110 personnel can be on board, ranging from senior command staff and intelligence teams to communications specialists, security units and flight crew.The aircraft can remain airborne for extended periods using in-flight refuelling, allowing national leadership to operate independently of ground infrastructure. Advanced satellite systems provide global connectivity, ensuring uninterrupted command authority.The E-4B’s mission is directed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and executed through US Strategic Command, with Air Force Global Strike Command responsible for aircrew, maintenance, security and communications support.Despite its ominous nickname, the E-4B has been activated in a real emergency only once, in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks, when it was used to ensure continuity of government.Training flights occur regularly, but public sightings are uncommon, which is why this week’s multi-city journey stood out.The appearance comes amid heightened global tensions, including a widening US military campaign linked to Venezuela and the recent capture of President Nicolás Maduro, who has since been transferred to New York to face criminal charges.US officials have not linked the E-4B’s movement to those developments. Even so, the coincidence of timing has fuelled online speculation, particularly given the aircraft’s singular role in worst-case national security planning.Whether the flight reflected routine logistics, senior-level travel requirements, heightened security precautions, or strategic signalling remains unclear. What is clear is that the E-4B exists precisely for moments when ambiguity, uncertainty and risk dominate the strategic landscape.When the Doomsday Plane appears in public view, it tends to raise the same quiet question every time: not what has happened, but what the US government is preparing for.","Boeing E-4B Nightwatch, better known as the US military’s “Doomsday Plane,” made a rare and highly visible appearance this week.

‘Will Shoot First, Ask Later’: NATO Troops ‘Ready For War’ If Trump Orders Greenland Invasion |Watch

Europe scrambles to push back

'$10,000 to $100,000 per person'





Denmark has warned that its troops are under standing orders to ""shoot first and ask questions later"" if Greenland comes under attack, as anxiety grows in Europe over the United States under President Donald Trump openly weighing military action to seize the Arctic territory.The country's defence ministry said a Cold War-era rule obliges soldiers to respond immediately to any foreign invasion without waiting for political clearance or formal orders. Speaking to Danish newspaper Berlingske, the ministry said the directive requires forces to ""immediately take up the fight"" if attacked and remains fully in force.The rule, introduced in 1952, states that in the event of an invasion, troops must act “without waiting for or seeking orders, even if the commanders in question are not aware of the declaration of war or state of war”. Danish officials said the provision applies regardless of who the invading force may be.The warning comes as European leaders struggle to frame a response to repeated statements by Trump, who has refused to rule out the use of force to annex Greenland. The White House has said Trump is still considering all options, heightening unease among Denmark’s allies.European governments have rallied behind Copenhagen, with calls for a coordinated response to any US move against Greenland.French foreign minister Jean-Noel Barrot said he would discuss the issue with his German and Polish counterparts, emphasising the need for collective action.“We want to take action, but we want to do so together with our European partners,” Barrot told France Inter radio.He added that US Secretary of State Marco Rubio had “discarded” the idea that Greenland could face an intervention similar to the recent US assault on Venezuela aimed at ousting President Nicolas Maduro. Despite those assurances, Denmark’s reaffirmation of its shoot-first doctrine underscores how seriously it is preparing for the possibility of escalation.The Trump administration is considering a plan to offer direct cash payments to Greenlanders in an effort to persuade them to break away from Denmark and move closer to the United States, according to multiple sources cited by news agency Reuters.US officials have talked internally about offering lump sum payments of between $10,000 and $100,000 per person to residents of Greenland. The island nation is currently a semi-autonomous Danish territory with a population of about 57,000 and has an abundance of useful natural resources. The idea remains at a preliminary stage and details are still unclear. Aides have discussed figures that could amount to nearly $6 billion in total, sources said.Another option being discussed is a Compact of Free Association, an agreement the US already has with some Pacific island nations. Under such deals, the US provides financial aid and defence protection in return for military access. Greenland would likely have to become independent from Denmark first, and payments could be used to encourage public support for that step or for a future agreement.Polls show most Greenlanders favour independence from Denmark, but surveys also indicate they do not want to become part of the United States.",Denmark warns troops to'shoot first and ask questions later' if Greenland comes under attack.

It is so obvious. I’m sorry, you can’t have him. Miller is the best.

‘Won’t Tolerate Imperialist…’: Mexico, Cuba Cross Swords With US Over ‘Illegal Venezuela Rule’

After, Venezuelan military op and threatening Greenland and Columbia, US President Donald Trump now seems to turn his attention to Mexico, to target drug cartels, following maritime attacks in the eastern Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea.“We are going to start now hitting land with regard to the cartels. The cartels are running Mexico,” said Trump in an interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity aired on Thursday night, signalling a tougher stance on cross-border cartel operations.Any direct action against cartels inside Mexico, however, would represent a major escalation of US military involvement in the region. Trump said on Sunday that he was pressing Sheinbaum to allow US troops to operate in Mexico against drug cartels, an offer he claimed she had previously rejected.then, Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum warned on Monday that the Americas “do not belong” to any single power, responding to Trump’s comments about Washington’s “dominance” of the hemisphere following Maduro’s capture.Trump’s remarks comes after the surprise capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro last weekend, the climax of months of sustained US military and economic pressure on the leftist regime.US had been carrying out strikes on suspected drug-trafficking vessels since September, killing more than 100 people. Trump has also said US forces conducted a land strike on a Venezuelan docking facility used by such boats. Caracas’ left-wing interim government has condemned the US strikes as a threat to regional stability.Trump also said that he plans to ""buy"" Greenland, following Denmark President gave a sharp reaction.

Can Barron Trump marry Denmark’s Princess and secure Greenland as dowry?

A somewhat orthodox idea running through the MAGA side of social media claims to have solved one of Donald Trump’s most controversial foreign policy obsessions.The so-called diplomatic solution suggests that Donald's son, Barron Trump, could marry Denmark’s Princess Isabella and secure Greenland for the United States as a dowry gift.The bizarre theory has gone viral after Trump once again revived his long-standing ambition to take control of Greenland, and potentially make it the 51st state that the US prez always wanted. The GOP government has described the Arctic territory as of strategic importance to US security.Supporters online now claim that a royal marriage between Trump’s youngest son, Barron, 19, and Princess Isabella, 18, would solve the problem.One user wrote on X: “The simple diplomatic solution is Barron Trump marries Princess Isabella of Denmark and Greenland is given to America as dowry payment”. The post attracted millions of interactions and AI-generated images of the imagined couple.There is no basis in law, diplomacy or royal protocol for such a claim, but it has gained traction at a time when Trump’s is considering different ways of acquiring Greenland, be it through diplomacy, by force, or just ""buying it.""Greenland is part of the Kingdom of Denmark but is a self-governing territory rather than part of Denmark proper, with its own government and parliament controlling most domestic affairs.Denmark’s Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen is not very happy with the MAGA chief thinking Greenland is available for the taking.Frederiksen told public broadcaster DR: “Unfortunately, I think the American president should be taken seriously when he says he wants Greenland.""Greenland does not want to be a part of the US: “I have made it very clear where the Kingdom of Denmark stands, and Greenland has repeatedly said that it does not want to be part of the United States.”She added: “If the United States attacks another NATO country, everything stops.”Greenland is an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark and is not a monarchy in its own right. Princess Isabella has no constitutional role over Greenland. Hence, the idea of a dowry transfer is legally meaningless.Nevertheless, Trump’s interest in Greenland is real.The island has a population of about 58,000 and no independent military. Denmark is responsible for its defence but has limited resources to cover such a vast area.Another option floated by Trump allies is buying Greenland, an idea previously raised by President Harry Truman back in 1946. Both Copenhagen and Nuuk have repeatedly said the territory is not for sale. Any purchase would require congressional approval, Senate backing and likely EU consent.A softer approach could involve influence campaigns aimed at encouraging Greenlandic independence, followed by a close partnership with Washington. However, many Greenlanders favour independence from Denmark; they do not want to become part of the US.","Theory suggests that Donald's son, Barron Trump, could marry Denmark’s Princess Isabella and secure Greenland for the United States as a dowry gift. There is no basis in law, diplomacy or royal protocol for such a claim, but it has gained traction.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126415278,imgsize-714608,width-400,resizemode-4/126415278.jpg"

Q. What should UK visa holders using physical documents or expired BRP cards do?

Q. What must travellers with an existing e-visa do before travelling?





Planning a trip to the United Kingdom from the UAE will soon require more than just a passport and ticket. Emirates has warned travellers that the UK is rolling out major changes to its immigration system, and missing a new digital requirement could mean being denied boarding altogether.Dubai-based Emirates has issued an official advisory for UAE residents traveling to the United Kingdom, urging them to familiarize themselves with new British entry requirements as the country transitions to a fully digital immigration system.According to the airline, the UK authorities are replacing physical immigration documents with electronic visas, known as e-visas, and introducing the Electronic Travel Authorisation, or ETA. The ETA is a digital permission to travel and will be mandatory for certain visitors who previously did not require a visa.These changes apply across multiple traveller categories and are being phased in ahead of a firm enforcement deadline.Emirates clarified that travellers who do not need a visa for short stays in the UK of up to six months will now need to obtain an Electronic Travel Authorisation.Passengers can check whether they need an ETA and apply through the official UK government website at www.gov.uk/electronic-travel-authorisation.The airline highlighted a critical date tied to this requirement. From February 25, 2026, eligible visitors who do not hold a valid ETA will not be allowed to board their transport and will not be able to legally travel to the United Kingdom.Emirates strongly advised customers to apply well in advance of their flight date to avoid disruptions at the airport.The advisory also targets travellers who already hold UK visas but rely on physical documents to prove their immigration status.According to Emirates, passengers who use paper immigration documents, or those who have an expired biometric residence permit (BRP) or biometric residence card (BCP), must take immediate steps to access their digital immigration status.These travellers are required to create an account with UK Visas and Immigration to convert their status to an eVisa. This can be done at www.gov.uk/eVisa.The airline emphasized that relying on outdated or physical documents could cause problems during travel as the UK moves away from paper-based verification.Emirates also addressed travellers who hold indefinite leave to remain in the UK. Passengers who currently prove their ILR status using a passport stamp or vignette are eligible to apply for a free No Time Limit application in order to access an e-visa.For travellers who already have an e-visa, the airline stressed the importance of keeping passport details up to date. If the passport intended for travel is not already linked to the eVisa account, travelers must notify UK authorities through www.gov.uk/update-uk-visas-immigration-account-details.Failing to update passport information could result in delays or complications during boarding or entry into the UK.Travelers who do not require a visa for short stays in the UK of up to six months must obtain an Electronic Travel Authorisation before travelling.From February 25, 2026, eligible visitors without a valid ETA will not be allowed to board their transport or legally travel to the United Kingdom.They must create a UK Visas and Immigration account to access their immigration status digitally through an e-visa.They must ensure the passport they intend to use is linked to their UK Visas and Immigration e-visa account and update it if necessary.","Emirates has issued an official advisory for UAE residents traveling to the UK.

Another Trump STRIKE! Fifth Oil Tanker With Venezuelan Oil ‘CAPTURED’; Russia Watches Closely





US President Donald Trump wore a small lapel pin showing a cartoon image of himself during a meeting with top oil executives at the White House on Friday.The pin, placed just below the traditional American flag pin on his suit, was noticed by reporters during a question-and-answer session. When asked about it, Trump said it was called a “Happy Trump”.“Somebody gave me this,” Trump told reporters. “Considering the fact that I’m never happy, I’m never satisfied. I will never be satisfied until we make America great again. But we’re getting pretty close.”The moment quickly drew attention online, with social media users sharing images and comments about the pin, which shows Trump with an exaggerated facial expression.The exchange happened during a meeting where Trump and members of his Cabinet met nearly two dozen representatives from some of the world’s largest oil companies. The discussions focused on future plans related to Venezuela’s oil production and possible US involvement and investments in the country’s energy sector.This was not the first time Trump has worn the same pin. He had worn it earlier during a February ceremony to swear in Tulsi Gabbard as director of National Intelligence, though he did not comment on it at the time.According to online listings, a pin with a similar Trump design is available for sale online.US presidents have traditionally worn American flag lapel pins since the September 11, 2001, attacks. Trump continued that practice, with the “Happy Trump” pin added alongside it during Friday’s meeting.","US President Donald Trump wore a small lapel pin showing a cartoon image of himself during a meeting with top oil executives at the White House on Friday.

Trump 'FEARS' Putin & Xi; Announces Greenland Takeover 'Easy Or Hard Way' To Keep Russia, China Away





US President Donald Trump late Friday once again spoke about taking action on Greenland, saying the US would have to do “something” or risk Russia and China stepping in. He said Washington does not want Moscow or Beijing as its “neighbours”.Speaking to reporters during a meeting with top oil and gas executives, Trump questioned Denmark’s claim over Greenland, saying that landing a boat there 500 years ago does not give ownership of the land.When asked about Greenland, Trump said, ""We are going to do something on Greenland, whether they like it or not, because if we don't do it, Russia or China will take over Greenland -- and we're not going to have Russia or China as a neighbour. I would like to make a deal the easy way but if we don't do it the easy way, we're going to do it the hard way"".He added, ""And by the way, I'm a fan of Denmark as well. They've been very nice to me. I'm a big fan but the fact that they had a boat land there 500 years ago doesn't mean that they own the land. We had lots of boats go there also. But we need that because if you take a look at outside of Greenland right now, they are Russian destroyers, Chinese destroyers and bigger there are Russian submarines all over the place.We're not going to have Russia or China occupy Greenland and that's what they're going to do if we don't. We will do something with Greenland either the nice way or the difficult way.""When questioned about why the US needed to “own” Greenland when it already has a military presence there, Trump said ownership was essential for defence.He said, ""When we own it we defend it. You don't defend leases the same way. You have to own it. Countries have to have ownership and you defend ownership. You don't defend leases. If we don't do it, China or Russia well. That's not going to happen... Nato has to understand that. I'm all for Nato. I saved it. If it weren't for me, Nato would not be there.""Trump’s repeated comments on Greenland have drawn strong pushback from Denmark and Greenland. Copenhagen has warned that its troops are under orders to “shoot first and ask question later” if Greenland comes under attack, as concerns grow in Europe over the US openly discussing possible military action against the Arctic territory.Earlier, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen rejected Trump’s claims that the US “needs” Greenland for security reasons, calling them an “unacceptable pleasure”.When asked what it would mean if the US used force against another Nato member, Frederiksen said, ""If the US attacks another Nato country, everything stops."" She added that while she could not predict Washington’s actions, ""there is full support from Europe that borders must be respected.""Trump has renewed his push to take over Greenland, a semi-autonomous Danish territory rich in natural resources such as rare earth minerals, uranium and iron. His latest remarks come days after the US used military force in Venezuela to seize President Nicolas Maduro.For decades, the US has viewed Greenland as strategically important. Under Trump, the island has again been placed at the centre of Washington’s Arctic strategy. Trump had earlier offered to buy Greenland in 2019 during his first term, but Denmark said it was not for sale.Trump has repeatedly warned that Russia and China could take control of foreign territories if the US does not act. Referring to the Venezuela operation, he said, ""If we didn't do what we did, China or Russia would have been in Venezuela.""In response to a question about Europe, Trump sharply criticised wind energy. He said, ""I'm not much of a windmill person. I can proudly say that we have not approved one wind mill since I've been in office and we're going to keep it that way. My role is to not let any windmill get build. They're losers. They lose money, they destroy your landscape, they kill your birds, they are all made in China"".He also suggested that Europe should question China about its own use of wind power.Trump said, ""They (China) use coal, oil and gas and some nuclear but they don't have windmills. They make them and sell them to suckers like Europe and suckers like the United States before. They are the worst form of energy, most expensive form of energy"".These remarks came shortly after Trump signed a memorandum directing the US to withdraw from international organisations, conventions and treaties that he said were “contrary to the interests” of the US.According to a White House statement, the move includes withdrawal from 35 non-UN organisations and 31 UN entities. Among the non-UN organisations listed are the India- and France-led International Solar Alliance, environmental bodies such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.Other organisations affected include the International Energy Forum, the International Renewable Energy Agency, the Partnership for Atlantic Cooperation and the Global Counterterrorism Forum.","US President Donald Trump said the US would have to do ‘something’ or risk Russia and China stepping in.

Donald Trump Tells Netanyahu He Stopped India-Pakistan War The 70th Time Since Op Sindoor Paused





During a White House meeting with US oil industry leaders on Saturday, President Donald Trump reiterated sweeping assertions about his foreign policy record, including his long-repeated claim that he single-handedly prevented a major war between India and Pakistan.Trump tied this and several other conflict de-escalation claims to his belief that he deserves a Nobel Peace Prize for his global peacemaking efforts.""I settled 8 wars... Some of them, which were just getting ready to start, like India and Pakistan, where already 8 jets were shot down... I got it done in rapid order, without nuclear weapons. I can't think of anybody in history who should get the Nobel Peace Prize other than me; nobody else settled wars,” said Trump.“President Putin called me, and mentioned about 2 of the wars he had been wanting to stop for 10 years... Pakistan's Prime Minister came here and made a public statement saying President Trump saved 10 million lives involving Pakistan and India, and that was going to be raging,” he added.Pressed by a reporter about Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado, who won the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize and dedicated it in part to Trump for US actions against the Maduro regime, Trump said he had not yet spoken with her but would do so and “might be involved in some aspect” of future efforts.In a previous interview with Fox News, Trump had described the India-Pakistan crisis as one of “eight and a quarter” wars he claimed to have ended, insisting his actions, including warnings about trade and tariffs, prevented a serious escalation. He said, “India-Pakistan was ready to go at it big … and I got that one stopped.”India has consistently rejected claims of US mediation in the May 2025 ceasefire, stating bilateral military-to-military talks led to the halt in hostilities without outside intervention. Foreign policy analysts also note that while Trump has supported ceasefires in several conflicts, his characterization of them as “ended wars” and a basis for Nobel consideration is widely disputed.","President Donald Trump said he stopped a looming war between India and Pakistan without nuclear weapons.

‘Won’t Stay Silent’: Macron Issues Big Warning To US As Trump Mulls Greenland Invasion





President Donald Trump warned that the United States will take action on Greenland, saying it will act “the easy way” or “the hard way” to prevent Russia or China from gaining influence on the Arctic island.Addressing a gathering on Saturday at the White House, Trump said, ""We are going to do something on Greenland, whether they like it or not, because if we don't do it, Russia or China will take over Greenland, and we're not going to have Russia or China as a neighbour. I would like to make a deal the easy way, but if not, we are going to do it the hard way.”Emphasising the strategic importance of the island, he said, “When we own it, we defend it...

We have to defend Greenland, because if we don't, China or Russia will.”The Trump administration is reportedly considering offering direct cash payments to Greenlanders to encourage closer ties with the United States. Sources cited by Reuters said officials have discussed lump sums ranging from $10,000 to $100,000 per person.Greenland, a semi-autonomous Danish territory with around 57,000 residents, is rich in natural resources.Denmark has expressed alarm over the potential US actions, warning that its troops are under standing orders to ""shoot first and ask questions later"" if Greenland comes under attack. European officials have also voiced concern over the United States openly weighing military options in the Arctic territory.The plan remains at a preliminary stage, with aides estimating that total payments could amount to nearly $6 billion. Another option under discussion is a Compact of Free Association, similar to agreements the US has with several Pacific island nations, in which the United States provides financial aid and defence protection in exchange for military access.

'Embarrassingly obvious': H-1B spouses sue US over ending automatic work permit extensions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/embarrassingly-obvious-h-1b-spouses-sue-us-over-ending-automatic-work-permit-extensions/articleshow/126443276.cms,"U.S. Rewrites H-1B Rules, Setback To Indian Workers; Check Who Is Eligible & Changes | WATCH





A new lawsuit filed by the spouses of H-1B visa holders has challenged the new US rule of ending the automatic extension of work permits. On October 29, 2025, the US Department of Homeland Security issued an interim final rule that ends the practice of automatically extending EADs for certain individuals who apply for renewal. The lawsuit said it violated the Administrative Procedure Act because it was arbitrary and capricious and failed to establish good cause for skipping notice and comment rulemaking, Bloomberg reported.The intention behind the new rule was more screening and vetting, the USCIS said in October. “USCIS is placing a renewed emphasis on robust alien screening and vetting, eliminating policies the former administration implemented that prioritized aliens’ convenience ahead of Americans’ safety and security,” said USCIS director Joseph Edlow. “It’s a commonsense measure to ensure appropriate vetting and screening has been completed before an alien’s employment authorization or documentation is extended. All aliens must remember that working in the United States is a privilege, not a right.”Under the new rule, individuals have to seek a timely renewal by properly filing a renewal application up to 180 days before their EAD expires. The longer an alien waits to file an EAD renewal application, the more likely it is that they may experience a temporary lapse in their employment authorization or documentation, the USCIS said.The lawsuit said the true rationale behind the move is embarrassingly obvious. “The administration’s true rationale, stripping the ability of people lawfully in the US to sustain themselves, is embarrassingly obvious,” it said.Although it failed to complete a rule ending work permits entirely for H-1B spouses, the administration “accomplished the same end by creating processing burdens, and pretextual biometric collections,” according to the suit.Spouses of H-1B visa holders are admitted on H-4 visa s to the US. They can only seek work permits after their spouse on an H-1B visa completes the initial steps to secure a permanent immigrant visa. For H-4 visa holders, the timeline for renewing can be even tighter because their legal status and employment authorization must coincide with their spouse’s status.","A new lawsuit filed by the spouses of H-1B visa holders has challenged the new US rule of ending the automatic extension of work permits.

US President Donald Trump said Friday that his administration would decide which oil companies will be allowed to operate in Venezuela following the capture of its leader, Nicolas Maduro, and pledged to guarantee security for their operations.“We're going to be making the decision as to which oil companies are going to go in, that we're going to allow to go in, going to cut a deal with the companies,” Trump told top energy executives at the White House.

""You're dealing with us directly, you're not dealing with Venezuela at all, we don't want you to deal with Venezuela,"" Trump told the gathering.“At least 100 Billion Dollars will be invested by BIG OIL, all of whom I will be meeting with today at The White House,” Trump said in a pre-dawn social media post.The investment push comes days after a U.S military raid captured Maduro, an action Trump has since framed as a major economic opportunity for the United States.He has said the US is seizing tankers carrying Venezuelan oil and taking over sales of 30 million to 50 million barrels of previously sanctioned oil, with plans to control those sales worldwide indefinitely.On Friday, US forces seized a fifth tanker over the past month linked to Venezuelan oil. The move highlights the administration’s intention to exert control over Venezuela’s exporting, refining and production of petroleum, signaling long-term US involvement in the sector as it seeks commitments from private companies.The strategy also aligns with Trump’s broader goal of keeping gasoline prices low. With many Americans focused on affordability, the administration has portrayed its actions in Venezuela as a way to influence global energy markets and ease pressure on prices at home.Companies attending the meeting include Chevron, which continues to operate in Venezuela, as well as ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips, which lost oil projects during a 2007 nationalization under former President Hugo Chávez.

Reports of several B1/B2 visa applications getting rejected surfaced on social media Friday, claiming that these rejections took place in the past few days. No clear reasons were given for these rejections; the applicants claimed. This came at a time when the H-1B visa stamping has been delayed in India for months, ever since the social media vetting began on December 15, 2025.B1/B2s are short-term visitor visas for business or tourism and can't be used for work in the US.

Minnesota ICE Killing: Jonathan Ross Pulled The Trigger On American; 'Has History Of Violence...'





Another shooting incident in which ICE agents shot a Venezuelan couple purportedly fleeing immigration enforcement in Portland on Thursday has escalated confrontation between the federal government in Washington and Democratic-led states and cities across America, rapidly becoming one of the most volatile issues heading into the 2026 midterm elections.Sparked by the deadly ICE encounter in Minneapolis in which a mother of three was gunned down, resulting in mass protests in Democratic strongholds and sharply competing narratives from Washington and local leaders, the conflict has evolved into more than a debate over immigration enforcement. At its core is a sweeping assertion by senior federal officials, including Vice President J.D. Vance, that ICE agents enjoy broad — even “absolute” — immunity from state or local prosecution when acting in the course of federal duties.That claim, coupled with the administration’s decision to hand both the Minneapolis and the Portland shooting investigations entirely to the FBI while cutting state authorities out of the process, has hardened opposition among Democrats and unsettled some Republicans as well.For Democratic leaders, particularly in urban centers and blue states, the issue has become a rallying cry around civil liberties and local autonomy.Governors, mayors, and attorneys general have framed the federal response as an unprecedented power grab, warning that if Washington can sideline state investigators in a civilian shooting, the precedent could extend far beyond immigration.Civil liberties activists are accusing the Trump administration of criminalizing protests as “terrorism,” with the objective of dividing the population via chaos and erosion of faith in institutions, and inciting cycles of revenge and violence to usher in authoritarian rule once the populace is worn down enough to the point they will accept any leadership that promises security.Democrats see political opportunity, especially in energizing young voters, communities of color, and progressive activists who have long viewed ICE as an unaccountable force. In Minnesota and Oregon, candidates are already tying the shootings to broader arguments about unchecked federal authority, using video evidence and eyewitness accounts to counter federal claims of self-defense.Republicans, meanwhile, face a more complicated calculus. On one hand, the administration’s hard-line posture plays well with voters who prioritize immigration enforcement and law-and-order messaging. GOP candidates in red districts and rural areas have defended ICE agents as operating in dangerous conditions and accused Democratic officials of undermining federal law enforcement -- challenging a raft of videos showing a woman trying to drive away from ICE agents.On the other hand, the claim of near-total immunity for ICE has not gone unchallenged — even within Republican ranks. Several GOP lawmakers have publicly voiced discomfort with what they see as federal overreach encroaching on states’ rights, a core conservative principle.“Immunity isn’t a blank check. If we’re trampling state investigations, we’re no better than the overreaching feds we criticized under Biden,” Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky wrote on X, reflecting a strain of libertarian skepticism that has grown louder as the administration doubles down.Beyond the immediate politics, analysts warn the confrontation could have lasting consequences for federal-state relations. Some describe an emerging “cold war” dynamic, in which blue states increasingly resist federal mandates through lawsuits, sanctuary policies, and even reduced cooperation on unrelated matters such as disaster response or infrastructure coordination.The FBI’s unilateral takeover of the shooting investigations, they note, could become a test case for Supreme Court battles over the 10th Amendment, which deals with center-state relations – further straining an already polarized judiciary. The 10th Amendment essentially says the federal government only has powers explicitly granted to it in the constitution; everything else is the domain of states. Political pundits are also warning that prolonged standoffs of this kind taking place in Minneapolis and Portland risk pushing the country toward “de facto balkanization,” with red and blue states differing widely on issues like immigration.The growing chasm is also exacerbated by salty language, including the popular Trumpian warning to critics to FAFO (F**k Around and Find Out). On Thursday, after ICE rained heat on an immigrant couple, Oregon Congresswoman Janelle Bynum released a statement that told the federal government, among other things, “Don’t f**k with us.”","Shooting incident in which ICE agents shot a Venezuelan couple purportedly fleeing immigration enforcement in Portland on Thursday has escalated confrontation between the federal government and Democratic-led states and cities.

Renee Nicole Good, the 37-year-old woman, who was shot dead by an ICE agent in Minneapolis, briefly left the US and lived in Canada after President Donald Trump won the election in 2024, reports claimed.

Some of her family members claimed Good was not an activist but her partner Rebecca said she brought her there. Eyewitnesses also claimed they were making videos of the protest.Good was married thrice and the last time was with Rebecca. With her first husband, Good had two children but did not get their custody after the divorce.

Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif in a controversial statement has urged the United States and Turkey to “kidnap” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu if they believed in justice and humanity, over the Israel-Gaza conflict.In a televised interview, whose clips have now gone viral on social media, Asif said the US should apprehend Netanyahu “just as Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro was taken away.”He added that Turkey could also seize the Israeli leader, and “Pakistanis are praying for it.”Describing Netanyahu as the “worst criminal of humanity,” Asif claimed that “no atrocities in history match those committed against Palestinians in Gaza.” He added, “No community has done what Israel has done to Palestinians in the last 4,000-5,000 years. He [Netanyahu] is the biggest criminal of humanity. The world has not seen a bigger criminal.”Asif also appeared to raise the issue of penalising those he termed as enablers of such crimes, beginning a sentence with, “And what does the law say about those who support such criminals…” before the show’s anchor, Hamid Mir, interjected and called for a break.Mir warned that Asif’s remarks risked being interpreted as a veiled reference to US President Donald Trump, and indicated that Asif would not remain on air after the break.Pakistan does not have formal diplomatic relations with Israel and has historically expressed strong support for the Palestinian cause. Islamabad also maintains close ties with Iran, another regional critic of Israeli policies.The international criminal court (ICC) has previously issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu in connection with alleged war crimes in Gaza, a legal development referenced during the interview.","Khawaja Asif said the US should apprehend Netanyahu “just as Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro was taken away” He added that Turkey could also seize the Israeli leader, and “Pakistanis are praying for it” Asif also appeared to raise the issue of penalising those he termed as enablers of such crimes.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126438854,imgsize-837064,width-400,resizemode-4/khawaja-asif-file.jpg"
Gen Z uprising in Pakistan? PhD student's article challenges those in power — why it was taken down,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/gen-z-uprising-in-pakistan-phd-students-article-challenges-those-in-power-why-it-was-taken-down/articleshow/126409692.cms,"Badshahi Mosque, Lahore (AP photo)





Is Pakistan heading towards a Gen Z uprising? A PhD student from the country has sparked a debate after critically examining present-day Pakistan, under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and army chief and de facto power centre Asim Munir , without naming either directly.The piece, written through a lens that shows contrast in powerful boomer generation and youth of Gen Z-Alpha, quickly struck a chord online and became a flashpoint for what many described as a quiet rebellion. It highlighted the widening divide between Pakistan’s ruling establishment, often referred to as “Boomers,” and its increasingly restless Gen Z population.The article, titled “It is over,” was written by US-based PhD student Zorain Nizamani and published in Pakistan’s daily The Express Tribune on January 1. It was later taken down, reportedly following pressure from the Pakistani military.“For the older men and women in power, it's over. The young generation isn't buying any of what you're trying to sell to them. No matter how many talks and seminars you arrange in schools and colleges, trying to promote patriotism, it isn't working,” Nizamani wrote.Writing from the perspective of Gen Z and Generation Alpha, Nizamani rejected what he described as an imposed narrative of patriotism pushed by those in power, arguing that such efforts no longer resonate with young Pakistanis.“Young minds, the Gen Z, the alphas, they know exactly what is happening, and despite your consistent efforts of trying to 'sell' your views of patriotism to them, they are seeing right through it. Thanks to the internet, thanks to whatever little education we have left, despite your best efforts of keeping the masses as illiterate as possible, you have failed. You have failed to tell people what to think, they are thinking for themselves. They might be a little too scared to speak their minds because they prefer breathing,” Nizamani wrote.He argued that forced patriotism, speeches and seminars cannot replace justice, opportunity and basic rights, and said young people clearly see corruption, inequality and hypocrisy despite censorship and propaganda.Nizamani also highlighted generational differences over economic freedom, writing, “The Gen Z wants erased restrictions on freelancing, the boomers want to increase regulations on freelancing.”Concluding his article, he wrote: “Boomers, we have had enough. We aren't buying your narrative anymore. It's worn out.”The article drew support from followers of former prime minister Imran Khan, who is currently incarcerated. The Canada wing of Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaaf (PTI) shared the article on X, highlighting its key points.“Zorain Nizamani's article ‘It is Over’ was removed from eTribune most likely for exposing the reality: DG ISPR's university visits are futile. The youth see through propaganda and are no longer easy to mislead or control,” the PTI Canada wing said.Pakistani activist Mehlaqa Samdani also linked the article’s removal to censorship. “Not surprisingly, this article is no longer accessible through the Express Tribune's digital edition, exactly the kind of censorship Zorain talks about,” she wrote.The episode has intensified online debate over whether Pakistan’s younger generation is moving from quiet disillusionment toward open resistance against an entrenched establishment widely seen as out of touch.","US-based PhD student Zorain Nizamani wrote an article on Pakistan's ruling establishment.

No IMF Loan In 6 Months? Pakistan Defence Minister’s Jet Export Claim Collapses Under Debt Reality

Pakistan's repeated reliance on IMF

Bangladesh shows interest in Pak's JF-17

Pak seeks JF-17 deal with Saudi Arabia





Pakistan on Tuesday expressed confidence that it may no longer need financial assistance from the International Monetary Fund within six months, with Pakistan defence minister Khawaja Asif claiming the country had seen a surge in aircraft orders following a four-day military standoff with India in May, Geo TV reported.Speaking on a Geo News programme, Asif made a fanciful claim while arguing that the May 2025 India-Pakistan conflict showcased Pakistan's ""resolve and military effectiveness"" to the world.Military tensions escalated in May 2025 after Pakistan-sponsored terrorists carried out a terror attack in Pahalgam, killing 26 civilians in April. India responded with a strong military operation, launching Operation Sindoor, under which it targeted and destroyed multiple terror camps and Pakistani military facilities.However, Khawaja Asif, appearing disconnected from the ground reality, made such statements after a Bangladeshi defence delegation met Pakistan's air chief to discuss a potential sale of the JF-17 Thunder, the multi-role fighter aircraft jointly developed by China and Pakistan.There are also reports of talks between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia to convert about $2 billion in Saudi loans into a JF-17 fighter jet deal, according to two Pakistani sources cited by Reuters.According to Arab News, several countries have since stepped up defence engagement with Pakistan.“Right now, the number of orders we are receiving after reaching this point is significant because our aircraft have been tested,” defence minister Asif told Pakistan’s Geo News channel.“We are receiving these orders, and it is possible that after six months we may not even need the IMF,” he said.Pakistan markets the Chinese co-developed JF-17 as a lower-cost multi-role fighter and has positioned itself as a supplier offering aircraft, training and maintenance outside Western supply chains.“I am saying this with full confidence,” Asif said. “If all these orders materialise over the next six months, we will not need the IMF.”Pakistan has repeatedly turned to the International Monetary Fund over the years, for financial support to stabilise its fragile economy, with such assistance tied to strict conditions including fiscal reforms, subsidy cuts and revenue-enhancing measures.In September 2024, the IMF approved a $7 billion bailout for Pakistan under its Extended Fund Facility (EFF), followed by a separate $1.4 billion loan under its climate resilience fund in May 2025, aimed at bolstering the country’s economic stability and climate resilience.Demonstrating Dhaka’s efforts to move closer to Islamabad, Bangladesh has expressed “potential interest” in acquiring the JF-17 Thunder fighter aircraft from Pakistan, along with plans to resume direct flights between the two countries from January 29 after a gap of more than a decade.The JF-17, jointly developed by China and Pakistan, was deployed by Pakistan against India during the May 7–10 hostilities. In November last year, Indian Air Force chief Air chief Marshal A P Singh said the aircraft was among at least five high-tech Pakistani fighters shot down during Operation Sindoor.This latest development and closeness between Pakistan and Bangladesh comes under the pretext of Dhaka's straining relations with India.Pakistan and Saudi Arabia are also in talks to convert around $2 billion in Saudi loans into a JF-17 fighter jet deal, as two Pakistani sources told Reuters, in a move that would deepen military cooperation between two Islamic nations. Pakistan and Saudi signed a mutual defence pact last year.The discussions highlight efforts by the long-time allies to operationalise defence cooperation at a time when Pakistan is under acute financial strain and Saudi Arabia is recalibrating its security partnerships amid uncertainty over US commitments in the Middle East.","Pakistani defence minister Khawaja Asif says country may not need IMF help in six months.

Pakistan’s Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry on Tuesday said that nearly 71% of terrorist incidents reported in 2025 originated from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP). He attributed this concentration to a “politically conducive environment and the flourishing political-criminal-terror-nexus which is flourishing there”.Data released by the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) reinforces the scale of the surge. KP recorded the sharpest rise in violence, with “fatalities rose from 1,620 in 2024 to 2,331 in 2025” — a year-on-year increase of more than 40%.The broader national picture is even starker. According to the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS), 2025 was the “deadliest” year in a decade, with 3,387 combat-related deaths. These included 2,115 terrorists, 664 security personnel, 580 civilians and 28 members of pro-government peace committees. PICSS said violence intensified in both “tempo and lethality”, pushing multiple security indicators to their highest levels in years.“Militant attacks climbed to their highest annual total since 2014, and the use of suicide bombings and small drones showed a clear upward trend,” the report said.Suicide attacks rose by 53%, while terrorist incidents overall increased to 1,063 — the highest since 2014.Security forces and civilians also bore rising costs. Security personnel fatalities rose 26% to their highest level since 2011, while civilian deaths increased by 24%, marking the worst toll in a decade. Injuries surged by 53% to 2,263, with sharp rises across all categories.The violence has been most acute in KP and Balochistan. In Bannu alone, Deputy Inspector General Sajjad Khan said 27 police personnel were killed in 134 attacks during 2025. Police carried out 168 intelligence-based operations, arresting 105 militants and killing 65, he said.Pakistan frequently accuses Afghanistan’s Taliban authorities of sheltering the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a militant group blamed for a sharp increase in attacks inside Pakistan since 2021. Afghan officials reject the allegations, insisting they do not permit their territory to be used for attacks against other countries.While the TTP operates independently from Afghanistan’s Taliban, the two groups maintain close ties.Relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan have deteriorated since October, when border clashes followed explosions in Kabul on Oct. 9 that Afghan officials attributed to Pakistan. Although Qatar later helped mediate a ceasefire, talks hosted by Turkey in November failed to produce a lasting agreement.","KP recorded the sharpest rise in violence, with “fatalities rose from 1,620 in 2024 to 2,331 in 2025’ The broader national picture is even starker. 2025 was the “deadliest” year in a decade, with 3,387 combat-related deaths.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126375028,imgsize-1338682,width-400,resizemode-4/photo-credit-ap.jpg"

ISLAMABAD: The polio vaccination campaign in Pakistan's merged districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa fell short of its target, leaving over 935,000 children under five unvaccinated, officials said, citing security challenges and population displacement as key hurdles, The Express Tribune reported.According to The Express Tribune, citing authorities, thousands of families from North and South Waziristan, Bajaur, and other merged districts have migrated to different parts of the country, complicating monitoring and vaccination efforts.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Khyber Pakhtunkhwa reported 19 polio cases in 2025, including four each in North Waziristan, Lakki Marwat, and Tank; three in Bannu; two in Torghar; and one each in Dera Ismail Khan and Lower Kohistan, as reported by The Express Tribune.Officials noted that staffing and operational support for WHO and Unicef programmes in the merged districts were reduced last year, while WHO funding cuts also affected campaign coverage, leaving children in these areas at heightened risk.In Sindh, more than 12,000 children under five were reportedly missed during the final polio drive of 2025 in Hyderabad and surrounding areas, according to The Express Tribune.Refusals were recorded mainly in Cantonment areas and municipal towns such as Hussainabad, Preetabad, Qasimabad, and Tando Jam, with absent households and parental refusals cited as primary reasons.Despite these gaps, the nationwide anti-polio campaign successfully vaccinated more than 44.6 million children across Pakistan, according to The Express Tribune.Punjab led with 22.9 million children vaccinated, followed by Sindh with 10.6 million, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with 7.15 million, and Balochistan with 2.58 million.Officials said contributions from other regions also added to the national tally.Authorities warned that without sustained vaccination efforts, particularly in displaced and high-risk populations, children in the merged districts remain vulnerable to polio, The Express Tribune reported.","Polio vaccination campaign in Pakistan's merged districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa fell short of its target.

Baloch leader Mir Yar Baloch has raised a “serious threat” warning over deepening China–Pakistan ties, claiming that China could deploy its military forces in Pakistan’s Balochistan region in the coming months.In an open letter to external affairs minister S Jaishankar, posted on X on New Year’s Day, Mir Yar Baloch said Baloch representatives view the growing strategic partnership between Islamabad and Beijing as “dangerous.”He said Balochistan has “faced decades of repression under Pakistan’s control,” including what he described as “state-sponsored violence” and “human rights abuses.”""The people of Balochistan have endured Pakistan's state occupation, state-sponsored terrorism, and egregious human rights atrocities for the past seventy-nine years. The time has now arrived to eradicate this festering affliction at its roots, ensuring lasting peace and sovereignty for our nation, "" he wrote.In his letter to EAM Jaishankar, Mir Yar Baloch said that China and Pakistan are rapidly moving toward the final stages of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a major Belt and Road Initiative project led by Chinese President Xi Jinping that passes through Balochistan.“The Republic of Balochistan views the escalating strategic alliance between Pakistan and China as profoundly dangerous.We warn that China, in collaboration with Pakistan, has advanced the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) to its final phases,” he said.He warned that unless Baloch resistance and defence forces are strengthened, the region could soon see direct Chinese military involvement.“Should the capabilities of Balochistan's defense and freedom forces not be further bolstered and if they continue to be overlooked as per longstanding patterns, it is conceivable that China could deploy its military forces in Balochistan within a few months,” the letter stated.Mir Yar Baloch also said that any Chinese troop deployment without the approval of the local people could have serious consequences for the region.“The presence of Chinese boots on Balochistani soil without the will of the 60 million Baloch people would pose an unimaginable threat and challenge to the futures of both Bharat and Balochistan,” he wrote.China and Pakistan have repeatedly rejected claims that CPEC has a military angle, saying the project is only economic. India, however, has always opposed CPEC, pointing out that it passes through Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir and affects India’s sovereignty and security.Earlier this year in the Rajya Sabha, minister of state for external affairs Kirti Vardhan Singh repeated India’s stance. In a written reply, he said: “Government's position on CPEC is clear and consistent. Government has consistently protested to parties concerned over the inclusion of the so-called 'China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)', which passes through parts of the Indian Union Territories of Ladakh and Jammu & Kashmir under illegal occupation of Pakistan, as a flagship project of 'OBOR/BRI' and asked them to cease these activities. Any proposed participation of third countries or expansion of the so-called CPEC projects to third countries is unacceptable.”Mir Yar Baloch also praised India’s recent counterterror military actions, highlighting Operation Sindoor, which targeted key terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir after the Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 people.“We commend the bold and resolute actions undertaken by the Modi Government in the previous year through Operation Sindoor, particularly targeting terrorism hubs facilitated by Pakistan and directed against the Pakistani military in response to Pahalgam terror attack. These measures demonstrate exemplary courage and a steadfast commitment to regional security and justice,” he wrote.There has been no official response so far from the Union government, or from Chinese or Pakistani authorities, to Mir Yar Baloch’s claims.",Baloch leader Mir Yar Baloch has raised a “serious threat” warning over deepening China–Pakistan ties. He claims that China could deploy its military forces in Pakistan’s Balochistan region in the coming months.

"India, Pakistan exchange list of nuclear installations: All about the 1988 agreement; what purpose does it serve — explained",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/india-pakistan-exchange-list-of-nuclear-installations-all-about-the-1988-agreement-what-purpose-does-it-serve-explained/articleshow/126285395.cms,"What the agreement says



Why the annual exchange matters



Historical context



Limits of the agreement







NEW DELHI: India and Pakistan on Thursday exchanged, through diplomatic channels, the list of nuclear installations and facilities covered under the Agreement on the Prohibition of Attack against Nuclear Installations and Facilities, the ministry of external affairs said.The exchange took place simultaneously in New Delhi and Islamabad, in keeping with the provisions of the bilateral agreement that governs the protection of nuclear infrastructure in both countries.According to the MEA, the agreement requires India and Pakistan to inform each other of the nuclear installations and facilities covered under the pact on 1 January of every calendar year. Thursday’s exchange marked the 35th consecutive exchange of such lists, with the first taking place on 1 January 1992.The annual exchange has continued uninterrupted for over three decades, even during periods of heightened political and military tension between the two neighbours.The Agreement on the Prohibition of Attack against Nuclear Installations and Facilities was signed on 31 December 1988 and entered into force on 27 January 1991, following the exchange of instruments of ratification by both sides.Under the agreement, both India and Pakistan commit themselves to refrain from undertaking, encouraging or participating in any action aimed at causing destruction of, or damage to, nuclear installations or facilities in the other country.The scope of the agreement is broad. Nuclear installations and facilities covered under the pact include nuclear power plants, research reactors, fuel fabrication units, uranium enrichment facilities, isotope separation plants, reprocessing units and sites storing significant quantities of radioactive material, whether fresh or irradiated.The agreement also specifies that both countries must exchange information on the locations of these facilities, typically in the form of latitude and longitude coordinates, once every year.The annual exchange of lists is designed to reduce the risk of accidental, miscalculated or deliberate attacks on sensitive nuclear infrastructure during periods of conflict or crisis.By formally identifying protected sites, the agreement seeks to prevent scenarios in which conventional military operations could inadvertently escalate into a nuclear crisis. An attack on a nuclear installation, even with conventional weapons, could have catastrophic humanitarian, environmental and strategic consequences.Security analysts view the exchange as a confidence-building measure that helps maintain a minimum level of predictability between two nuclear-armed neighbours with a long history of conflict.Notably, the exchange has continued even during times of strained relations, including after major crises such as the Kargil conflict, the 2001–02 military standoff, the 2016 Uri attack and the 2019 Pulwama attack and Balakot air strikes.When the agreement was negotiated in the late 1980s, both India and Pakistan were moving steadily towards overt nuclear capability, though neither had yet conducted nuclear tests. Concerns over pre-emptive strikes on nuclear facilities, particularly in the context of regional instability, were central to the discussions.The agreement was one of the earliest formal nuclear confidence-building measures between the two countries and predated their 1998 nuclear tests, after which both openly declared themselves nuclear weapon states.Since entering into force in 1991, the agreement has remained intact despite the absence of progress on broader nuclear arms control or risk-reduction mechanisms in South Asia.While the pact prohibits attacks on nuclear installations and facilities, it does not restrict the development, deployment or use of nuclear weapons themselves. Nor does it include verification mechanisms beyond the annual exchange of lists.The agreement also does not cover missile bases, command and control centres or other strategic military assets linked to nuclear weapons.Even so, diplomats and experts argue that the continued observance of the agreement reflects a shared recognition of the dangers posed by attacks on nuclear infrastructure.More than three decades after it came into force, the agreement remains one of the few enduring pillars of nuclear risk reduction between India and Pakistan.In an environment marked by limited dialogue and recurring tensions, the uninterrupted annual exchange of nuclear installation lists serves as a reminder that both sides continue to acknowledge the need to prevent catastrophic escalation.For now, the routine exchange remains a rare example of sustained institutional cooperation between the two countries in the nuclear domain.","India and Pakistan exchange list of nuclear installations and facilities covered under the Agreement on the Prohibition of Attack against Nuclear Installations and Facilities.

""To Build Peace That Lasts"": China Claims Credit for India-Pakistan Conflict, Follows Trump





ISLAMABAD: Traders across Pakistan have threatened a nationwide shutdown on January 16 if the government does not withdraw its decision to make the installation of Point of Sale (POS) machines mandatory, warning that the move would further burden small businesses and open new avenues for harassment by tax officials, as reported by Dawn.According to Dawn, the warning came during a protest rally held in Islamabad, where traders attempted to march from Aabpara Chowk towards the Red Zone to demonstrate against the Federal Board of Revenue's (FBR) directive.However, heavy police deployment stopped the procession near the Serena Hotel, forcing demonstrators to hold a sit-in at the spot.The protest was organised by the All Pakistan Anjuman-i-Tajran in collaboration with the Traders Action Committee and drew participation from shopkeepers and market representatives from Islamabad and Rawalpindi.Leaders of various trader bodies addressed the gathering, accusing the government of targeting small businesses instead of addressing large-scale corruption.Addressing the crowd, Ajmal Baloch, president of the Traders Action Committee in Islamabad, described the compulsory installation of POS machines as a ""black law"" designed to intimidate traders rather than reform the tax system.He claimed that under the guise of documentation, traders would be exposed to greater harassment and bribery demands by tax officials.Citing an International Monetary Fund assessment, Baloch alleged that corruption in Pakistan amounts to nearly PKR 53 trillion annually, with the FBR accounting for a major share.He accused the department of selectively targeting small shopkeepers while ignoring large-scale corruption.He also alleged that many FBR officials own assets beyond their known sources of income and that their families enjoy foreign education and luxurious lifestyles.The protest leaders also highlighted alleged irregularities in customs operations, claiming that consignments of legally imported goods had been seized and partially returned, while the rest allegedly disappeared, as highlighted by Dawn.Warning of tougher action ahead, the traders announced that if the government attempted to forcibly install POS machines or seal shops, they would block a major arterial road in Islamabad and stage a sit-in at Zero Point on January 16.They further threatened a countrywide shutdown strike if their demands were ignored.The protesters appealed to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to intervene and protect traders from what they described as arbitrary and heavy-handed actions by tax authorities, as reported by Dawn.","Traders across Pakistan have threatened a nationwide shutdown on January 16 if the government does not withdraw its decision to make the installation of Point of Sale (POS) machines mandatory.

Pakistan army chief field marshal Asim Munir hosted his daughter’s wedding last week in the garrison city of Rawalpindi, where she was married to her first cousin, Abdul Rehman, according to Pakistani media reports.The ceremony was attended by senior political leaders and top military officials but was kept low-key due to security considerations, with no official photographs released.Among those present at the ceremony were Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari, prime minister Shehbaz Sharif, deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar, Punjab chief minister Maryam Nawaz, the chief of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), and several serving and retired senior army officers, including former army chiefs.Pakistani journalist Zahid Gishkori said around 400 guests attended the event, which was deliberately kept subdued.Gishkori, in a video posted on social media platform YouTube, confirmed the family connection between the bride and groom. “Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir's daughter Mahnoor married his brother's son, ex-army captain turned civil servant Abdul Rehman Qasim,” he said.The groom, Abdul Rehman, is Munir’s nephew. According to local media, he previously served in the Pakistan Army as a captain before joining the civil administration through a quota reserved for army officers.He currently serves as an assistant commissioner.Munir has four daughters, and last week's ceremony marked the wedding of his third daughter.The wedding coincided with the arrival of UAE President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan in Pakistan on the same day, prompting speculation on social media about a possible link between the two events. However, Ghiskori said that the UAE president did not attend the wedding.Pakistan’s security and foreign policy under Munir remains critical. A report by Greek City Times said that global patience with Pakistan’s trajectory toward “religious extremism” was wearing thin, alleging that the country had moved toward a more theocratic posture while failing to curb radical elements at home.Another report by Asian News Post criticised Islamabad’s military-led approach to regional diplomacy, particularly in relation to Afghanistan, stating that the strategy had failed to stabilise borders or improve Pakistan’s international standing.","Munir has four daughters, and last week's ceremony marked the wedding of his third daughter.

Pakistan's former spy chief Faiz Hameed challenged his conviction by a military court which had sentenced him to 14 years in jail, media reports said on Monday.Hameed, the former chief of the powerful Inter-Services Intelligence, was convicted on December 11 by a Field General Court Martial (FGCM) on four counts - engaging in political activities, violating the Official Secrets Act, misusing authority and government resources, and causing wrongful loss to individuals.Hameed's lawyer Mian Ali Ashfaq confirmed that the appeal was filed two days ago, The Express Tribune newspaper reported.A separate application has also been submitted to the Court of Appeal's registrar at General Headquarters Pakistan Army, seeking a copy of the written decision, it said.""The appeal has already been filed,"" Ashfaq said, without disclosing the specific grounds raised in the challenge.Hameed was allowed to appeal against the sentence within 40 days, as given under Section 133-B of the Pakistan Army Act.The appeal will be heard by a Court of Appeals headed by a major general or a senior officer nominated by the army chief, who may uphold, modify or set aside the sentence.Hameed is being held at Special Prison Rawalpindi and has not been shifted to Adiala Jail, the report said.His conviction stems from a 2017 complaint filed by a property developer, who alleged that Hameed, then serving as a major general in the ISI, along with two other officers, raided his residence and business premises, confiscated valuables, and forced him to pay Rs 40 million while also funding a private television channel.The matter resurfaced in 2023 when the Supreme Court directed the property developer to approach the defence ministry, which subsequently instituted a Court of Inquiry in April 2024 to probe the allegations, leading to Hameed's arrest on August 12 that year.The FGCM proceedings commenced on August 12, 2024, and continued for around 15 months before the verdict was announced.Hameed retired from military service in November 2022, became the first former ISI director general to be tried by a military court and convicted.

Pakistan FM Ishaq Dar Admits India Hit Nur Khan Air Base In Operation Sindoor Strikes





Pakistan has once again found itself on the defensive after a senior government official publicly acknowledged the impact of India’s precision strikes on a key military installation during the escalation in May, following Operation Sindoor The admission came from Pakistan’s foreign minister and deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, who, during a year-end press briefing on Saturday, confirmed that India had targeted the Nur Khan Air Base in Rawalpindi’s Chaklala area. Dar acknowledged that the strike caused damage to the military installation and injured personnel stationed there.Addressing reporters, Dar said India had launched multiple drone incursions into Pakistani territory within a short span, underlining the scale of the operation. “They (India) send drones towards Pakistan. In 36 hours, at least 80 drones were sent... We were able to intercept 79 drones out of 80, and only one drone damaged a military installation and personnel were also injured in the attack,” he claimed, according to news agency ANI.Also Read: 'Was advised to take shelter in bunker': Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari's big Op Sindoor admission - watch The foreign minister went on to describe the sequence of events following the strikes, saying that Pakistan’s civil and military leadership, led by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, held an emergency meeting on the night of May 9 to respond to the evolving situation.He added that India “made the mistake” of attacking the Nur Khan Air Base in the early hours of May 10, a remark that further acknowledged the strike and its impact.Dar’s comments amount to a rare public admission by a top Pakistani official of India’s military action on Pakistani air bases in May. The strikes came after Operation Sindoor, launched by the Indian Armed Forces to target nine terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir, in retaliation for the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam that killed 26 civilians.The Pakistan Air Force’s Nur Khan Air Base in Chaklala suffered significant damage during the Indian precision strikes. India had launched Operation Sindoor in the early hours of May 7 as a direct response to the Pahalgam attack.The escalation that followed saw increased cross-border shelling by Pakistan and retaliatory action by Indian forces. The situation later took an unexpected turn when Pakistan’s Director General of Military Operations contacted his Indian counterpart to propose a ceasefire, which India accepted. The outreach from the Pakistani side was later confirmed by Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri, who said both sides agreed to halt all military operations on land, at sea and in the air.Satellite imagery released by Maxar Technologies on May 13 showed significant damage to multiple Pakistani air bases, including Nur Khan Air Base. The images revealed damage at four installations: Nur Khan Air Base in Rawalpindi, PAF Base Mushaf in Sargodha, Bholari Air Base and PAF Base Shahbaz in Jacobabad. A comparison of satellite images taken on April 25 and May 10 showed clear damage to air base facilities, corroborating the strikes.This is not the first time a senior Pakistani leader has acknowledged the attack on Nur Khan Air Base. In May, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif admitted that Indian ballistic missiles had hit the base and other locations, breaking from Pakistan’s usual practice of denying Indian military action.Addressing a ceremony at the Pakistan Monument on May 16, Sharif said, “At around 2:30 am on May 10, General Syed Asim Munir called me on a secure line and informed me that India's ballistic missiles had hit Nur Khan Airbase and other areas. Our Air Force used homegrown technology to save our country, and they even used modern gadgets and technology on Chinese jets,” Geo News reported.",Pakistan FM Ishaq Dar Admits India Hit Nur Khan Air Base In Operation Sindoor Strikes.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari admitted that he was urged to take shelter in a bunker for his safety during the four-day confrontation with India in May, a remark that underscored India’s prowess to strike deep into mainland Pakistan.According to Zardari, the advice came from his military secretary, though he claimed he refused to take shelter.“I had actually told him (secretary) four days earlier that a war was going to happen. But he came to me and said, ‘Sir, let’s go to the bunkers.’ I replied, ‘If martyrdom is to come, it will come here. Leaders don’t die in bunkers; they die on the battlefield. They don’t die sitting in bunkers,’” Zardari said on Saturday at a rally marking the death anniversary of his wife and former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, who was assassinated in 2007.He added that every worker of his Pakistan Peoples Party was ready to sacrifice his life for the nation.Zardari also responded to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “roti khao, varna meri goli toh hai hi” (eat your food peacefully, or else my bullet is waiting for you) warning to Pakistan, saying that it would be Pakistan that would fire the bullets.He further remarked that India may have an economy 10 times larger than Pakistan’s, but questioned where it would find the “courage” to fight a war.Indian armed forces launched Operation Sindoor on the intervening night of May 6–7 in retaliation for the Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 civilians.

Trump Puts Asim Munir On Gaza Test: Can Pak Army Chief Appease U.S & Avoid Backlash At Home?

Former Imran Khan aide Shahzad Akbar attacked in UK





Pakistan on Friday summoned Britain’s deputy high commissioner Matt Cannell after a video circulated online showing a woman at a rally in the UK referring to a possible attack on Pakistan Army chief General Asim Munir The ministry of foreign affairs called in Cannell to lodge a formal protest and demanded an investigation after the woman, speaking at a rally in Bradford in northern England, mentioned the possibility of the army chief being killed in a car bombing. Pakistani officials said the remarks went beyond political expression and raised serious security concerns.The rally was held in support of Pakistan’s jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan and was attended by his supporters living in the UK. Khan was removed from office through a no-confidence vote in April 2022 and has been in prison for nearly two years.The Bradford protest came days after a special court of Pakistan’s Federal Investigation Agency sentenced Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, to 17 years in prison each in the Toshakhana-II corruption case.According to Dawn, the court also imposed a fine of Pakistani Rs 16.4 million on each of them, with additional jail time possible in case of non-payment. The case relates to the alleged illegal retention and sale of state gifts received while Khan was in office.The video from the Bradford rally was initially shared on X by the UK chapter of Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party before being deleted.Explaining the decision, PTI UK said in a post on X: “We have removed a video from the recent Bradford protest featuring a citizen’s metaphorical remarks regarding General Asim Munir. Although we do not believe the individual incited violence, the post was deleted in an abundance of caution to prevent potential misunderstanding and legal safeguarding of the individual and her rights.”Pakistan’s deputy interior minister Talal Chaudhry said the remarks crossed a red line. Speaking to Geo Television, he said: “While Imran Khan’s party has been inciting supporters against the military, the car bomb threat at the Bradford rally crossed all limits. It does not fall into the category of freedom of speech.”He urged the UK government to investigate the incident and take legal action if laws were violated.Responding to Pakistan’s concerns, the UK High Commission in Islamabad said in a brief statement: “Where a foreign Government believes a crime has been committed, they should provide all relevant material to their UK police liaison. Any material that appears to break UK law will be reviewed by the police and may lead to a criminal investigation.”The diplomatic move comes amid escalating tensions between Khan’s supporters and Pakistan’s powerful military. Earlier this month, army spokesperson Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry described Khan as “mentally ill” during a press conference, after posts on Khan’s official X account referred to General Munir as “mentally unstable,” according to the Associated Press.Separately, tensions escalated further after PTI said Shahzad Akbar, a former adviser to Imran Khan was attacked in the United Kingdom on Thursday.In a post on X, Akbar said he was assaulted outside his home in Cambridge by an unidentified man.“Yesterday at approximately 8:08 a.m., I was attacked at my home by an unknown assailant dressed in what appeared to be construction or waste-collection attire,” Akbar wrote. “The individual asked, ‘Are you Shahzad Akbar?’ and immediately began assaulting me. The incident occurred in the presence of my family.”Akbar said he sustained facial injuries, including bruising and a fractured nose, and was taken to a local hospital before being discharged.“The police have taken cognizance of the matter and have assured me and my family that they are actively investigating this targeted attack and will work to apprehend both the perpetrator and those behind it,” he said.He added that he could not share further details at this stage, including CCTV footage, on the advice of authorities.“I have full faith in the rule of law and in British law enforcement to carry out their duties,” Akbar said, urging the UK government to ensure the safety of dissidents.In a follow-up statement, Akbar said the attack would not silence him.“I want to make one thing absolutely clear: If my views, political comments, or even my ‘face’ is not liked by anyone, such cowardly acts will only strengthen my resolve rather than silence me,” he wrote. “Violence will not intimidate me or deter me from speaking out.”The Pakistan government has previously submitted extradition documents to British authorities seeking Akbar’s return. Akbar, a PTI member, has been accused by the state of anti-government activities.",Pakistan summons Britain’s deputy high commissioner Matt Cannell.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan’s nuclear proliferation programme triggered deep concern at the highest levels of the United States and Russia, with both countries expressing that Islamabad’s nuclear activities made them “nervous”, according to newly declassified documents released by the US National Security Archive.The documents, made public this week following a Freedom of Information lawsuit, include verbatim transcripts of meetings and phone calls between former US president George W Bush and Russian president Vladimir Putin between 2001 and 2008. They reveal repeated discussions on Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal, links to Iran’s nuclear programme, and the role of the AQ Khan proliferation network.In a key Oval Office meeting in 2005, Putin raised concerns over evidence suggesting Pakistani-origin uranium had been found in Iranian centrifuges, questioning Western tolerance of Islamabad despite its proliferation record.“But it's not clear what the labs (Iran) have, where they are. Cooperation with Pakistan still exists,” Putin said during the meeting.Bush responded by referring to his discussions with then Pakistani president Pervez Musharraf, saying, “I talked to Musharraf about that. I told him we're worried about transfers to Iran and North Korea. They put AQ Khan in jail, and some of his buddies under house arrest. We want to know what they said.I keep reminding Musharraf of that. Either he's getting nothing, or he's not being forthcoming.”Putin reiterated his concerns, stating, “As far as I understand, they found uranium of Pakistani origin in the centrifuges.”Bush acknowledged the issue, saying, “Yes, the stuff the Iranians forgot to tell the IAEA about. That's a violation.”“It was of Pakistani origin. That makes me nervous,” Putin said, to which Bush replied, “It makes us nervous, too.”Also read: 'I want Pak': Rajnath recalls Vajpayee's unmatched wit; all about iconic moment The documents also highlight Putin’s blunt assessment of Pakistan during an earlier meeting with Bush in Slovenia in 2001. “I am concerned about Pakistan. It is just a junta with nuclear weapons. It is no democracy, yet the West makes no criticism of it. Should talk about it,” Putin said.According to the transcripts, both leaders expressed anxiety about Pakistan’s internal political instability, its military-led governance under Musharraf, and the risk that sensitive nuclear technology could fall into the wrong hands. The discussions repeatedly returned to the AQ Khan network, which was later confirmed to have supplied nuclear technology to Iran, North Korea, and Libya.The declassified records underscore longstanding international concerns about Pakistan’s nuclear command and control systems and the broader implications of its proliferation activities.The revelations come amid renewed scrutiny of Pakistan’s nuclear conduct. Last month, India criticised Islamabad following remarks by US President Donald Trump alleging that Pakistan had been secretly testing nuclear weapons.Reacting to Trump’s comments, Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said such actions were consistent with Pakistan’s history. “Clandestine and illegal nuclear activities are in keeping with Pakistan's history, which is centred around decades of smuggling, export control violations, secret partnerships, AQ Khan network and further proliferation,” he said.“India has always drawn the attention of the international community to these aspects of Pakistan's record,” Jaiswal added."," transcripts of meetings and phone calls between former US president George W Bush and Russian president Vladimir Putin released by US National Security Archive.

NEW DELHI: Exiled Bangladeshi-Swedish author Taslima Nasrin on Friday alleged that Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus , Bangladesh’s interim leader, has aligned himself with “fundamentalists” who are effectively running the country.“The fundamentalists are in power and Dr Yunus is supporting them. I do not know how we will restore this secular country, for which it fought against Pakistan in 1971,” Nasrin said at an event in Kerala's Thiruvananthapuram,. “Now the nation is divided, and Muslim extremists are killing and persecuting religious minority communities. This must be stopped.”In recent days, and since the fall of the Sheikh Hasina–led Awami League government in August 2024, after which the caretaker administration took charge, Bangladesh has witnessed multiple incidents in which Hindus have been killed.The Yunus administration has consistently denied that minorities are under threat, stressing that not all incidents were communally motivated, and distancing itself from allegations of targeted violence.Nasrin, however, said the situation was “very bad for Hindus in Bangladesh,” accusing Yunus of failing to act against what she described as “the killers, the fundamentalists and jihadis.”She also recalled the circumstances that forced her to leave Bangladesh in 1994 following the publication of her book Lajja.“When religious fanatics and extremists threatened my life and issued fatwas against me over my books, the government at the time took no action against them and instead issued an arrest warrant against me,” Nasrin told the audience. “Had the authorities acted against the fanatics and jihadists then, the country would not be in such a bad state today. The government used religion for political interests and to stay in power as long as possible. ”Nasrin also expressed hope that Bangladesh’s next general election would be “free and fair,” adding that meaningful change would come only if a “pro-secular party” came to power.The next general election in India’s neighbouring country is scheduled for February 12.","Exiled Bangladeshi-Swedish author Taslima Nasrin alleged that Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus has aligned himself with ‘fundamentalists’ Nasrin: “The fundamentalists are in power and Dr Yunus is supporting them.

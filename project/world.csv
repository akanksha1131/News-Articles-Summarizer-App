Who is Karoline Leavitt



President-elect Donald Trump on Friday named his ""highly effective communicator"" and campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt as his White House press secretary .""Karoline is smart, tough, and has proven to be a highly effective communicator,"" Trump said, adding, ""I have the utmost confidence she will excel at the podium, and help deliver our message to the American People as we, Make America Great Again.""Leavitt is the youngest White House press secretary, surpassing the previous record set by Ron Ziegler, who was 29 when President Nixon appointed him in 1969.The 27-year-old's appointment comes as a full circle from serving as an assistant press secretary in Donald Trump's first term to becoming one in the second term.Leavitt is a New Hampshire native who has previously served as assistant press secretary during Trump’s first term, from 2017 to 2021.After Trump’s 2020 defeat to Joe Biden, Leavitt served as communications director for Republican Representative Elise Stefanik, Trump’s pick for UN ambassador.In 2022, she ran for a New Hampshire House seat, winning the Republican primary before ultimately losing to Democrat Chris Pappas—but the experience sharpened her public speaking skills.Leavitt then returned to Trump’s orbit, leading communications for his 2024 campaign and transition team. Meanwhile, the Biden administration has seen two press secretaries: Jen Psaki and Karine Jean-Pierre.","Karoline Leavitt, 27, is the youngest White House press secretary in history.

"More Russians denounce each other over Ukraine, in echo of Soviet era",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/more-russians-denounce-each-other-over-ukraine-in-echo-of-soviet-era/articleshow/115349146.cms,"'Scum and traitors'

""From a bygone era""

LONDON: On the last day of January, a woman took her son to see paediatrician Nadezhda Buyanova at Polyclinic No. 140 in northwest Moscow. The boy, aged seven, had a problem with one of his eyes.The conversation that the boy's mother alleged took place during an 18-minute encounter at the clinic would change both women's lives and land the 68-year-old doctor in prison.The case hinged on a denunciation - part of a rising trend of Russians informing on fellow citizens for their views on the war in Ukraine and other alleged political crimes. Critics say the wave of denunciations is helping President Vladimir Putin 's government crack down on dissent.In a video recorded as she was walking away from the clinic, the mother, Anastasia Akinshina, said she had told the doctor the boy was traumatised because his father was killed fighting for Russia in the war in Ukraine.""Do you know what she told me? 'Well, my dear, what do you expect? Your husband was a legitimate target of Ukraine,'"" Akinshina said, mimicking the doctor's voice and intonation.Fighting back tears, Akinshina said she had raised the incident with the hospital administration and suspected they planned to hush it up.""So the question is: where can I complain about this bitch now, so that she'll be kicked out of the fucking country or sent to the devil in jail?"" she said in the video, which went viral on social media and thrust her into a high-profile criminal trial as the key prosecution witness.At the trial, Buyanova denied making the comment. But despite a lack of further adult witnesses, the denunciation was sufficient to destroy her 40-year medical career and her life.The doctor, who had been in pre-trial detention since April, appeared before a Moscow court on Tuesday, her grey hair closely cropped. She was found guilty under a wartime censorship law of ""publicly spreading deliberately false information"" about the armed forces and sentenced to five-and-a-half years in a penal colony.Buyanova was born in Ukraine but is a citizen of Russia, where she has lived and worked for three decades. Her lawyer Oscar Cherdzhiyev told Reuters the defence believed Akinshina acted out of malice because of the doctor's Ukrainian origins.Akinshina did not respond to written questions for this story, or answer her phone.At the trial, she stated: ""We are Russian. Buyanova hates Russians. She feels hostility towards me, that's what I think,"" according to a transcript by independent Russian outlet Mediazona.Two hospital staff who saw Akinshina after the consultation with Buyanova described her in evidence as being distraught.The prosecution's case was based almost entirely on Akinshina's account, along with a transcript read out in the trial of an interview with the child, conducted by an officer of the FSB security service. At first, Akinshina said the boy was not in the room when the comments were made, but later changed her story, telling the court she originally spoke in a state of shock.The judge rejected the defence's request to put its own questions to the child.Russian rights group OVD-Info has recorded 21 criminal prosecutions in politically-motivated cases based on denunciations since the launch of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Eva Levenberg, a lawyer with the group, told Reuters.Levenberg, who lives in Germany, said OVD-Info knew of a further 175 people who had faced lower-level administrative charges for ""discrediting"" the Russian army as a result of people informing on them in the same period, and 79 of these had been fined.Reuters was unable to independently confirm the numbers Levenberg provided.Russia's Justice Ministry did not respond to requests for comment about the data or the use of denunciations to support prosecutions, including in the Buyanova case. In response to a question posed by Reuters, Putin 's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the Kremlin does not comment on court rulings.Putin has said the country is in a proxy war with the West, and citizens need to help root out internal enemies. In March 2022, weeks after the invasion, he declared that the Russian people ""will always be able to distinguish the true patriots from the scum and the traitors, and just spit them out like a gnat that accidentally flew into their mouths.""Since the start of the Ukraine war, according to OVD-Info, the authorities have detained more than 20,000 people for various forms of anti-war statements or protests, and launched criminal cases against 1,094 individuals.In news reports, court cases and on social media, examples have come to light of neighbour informing on neighbour, churchgoers denouncing priests and students reporting on teachers.For some, the resulting current climate is reminiscent of the atmosphere of mutual distrust and suspicion under Soviet Communist rule.Olga Podolskaya is a former municipal deputy for the Tula region, south of Moscow, who by her own account earned a ""pesky"" reputation as an independent local politician prepared to stand up to the authorities. In the first hours after the Ukraine invasion, she added her signature to an open letter describing it as ""an unprecedented atrocity"" and urging citizens to speak out against it.Four months later, she was the subject of a public denunciation that asked for her finances to be investigated after she collected public donations to pay off a fine related to a protest in 2020. The denunciation was filed under the name ""Olga Minenkova"", but Podolskaya said no such person was ever identified, and she suspects the identity was a fake one. Reuters has seen a copy of the denunciation, but could not establish who filed it.Further public accusations followed, against her and her husband. Asked how she felt at the time, Podolskaya said it made her think of her great-grandfather, executed under Soviet dictator Josef Stalin in 1938 after someone informed against him.""The time of denunciations and 'enemies of the people' had returned. I realised that they were hinting I should leave the country,"" said Podolskaya.She left, in April 2023. In September that year she was placed on the Ministry of Justice's public ""foreign agent"" list. To protect her security, she asked Reuters not to disclose where she is based now.Doctor Andrei Prokofiev was targeted in 2023 by a prolific informer called Anna Korobkova who wrote to his employer demanding he be fired for anti-war comments he made to a foreign news outlet.Korobkova did not reply to a request for comment.In a letter last year to Alexandra Arkhipova, a sociologist who was the target of one of her denunciations, Korobkova said informing was ""in her blood"" as her grandfather had worked with Stalin's NKVD secret police. Arkhipova posted the letter on Telegram.Korobkova said she sent 764 denunciations to government agencies in the first year of the war alone, focusing on Russians who speak to foreign media. She likened her work to ""using submarines to destroy enemy ships"".Reuters was unable to confirm the extent or impact of her activity.Prokofiev told Reuters he suffered no repercussions, as he lives in Germany. But he fears going back to Russia: ""I don't think I would make it out of the airport. They would start a criminal case right away.""Prokofiev took a particular interest in Buyanova's case because, when he lived in Russia, his son was one of her patients. He describes her as a quiet, modest person - ""an elderly figure from a bygone era"" who tapped awkwardly with just one or two fingers on her computer.There has been some pushback against her trial. Prokofiev was among a total of 1,035 doctors who declared solidarity with Buyanova in an open letter, warning the case would put young people off entering medicine. Some of the doctors appeared in their scrubs speaking out in a video compilation posted on Facebook.Alexander Polupan, the doctor behind the Buyanova initiative as well as letters in support of dissidents including the late Alexei Navalny, said at least seven medics were questioned by police after signing them. Reuters could not verify those interrogations, and the Russian interior ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Polupan himself left Russia last year, ""when it became clear I would be arrested any day"", he told Reuters.Rachel Denber, Deputy Director of the Europe and Central Asian Division of New York-based Human Rights Watch, said prosecuting an older defendant from a respected profession sent a signal that nobody can afford to defy the official line on Ukraine.Even if Buyanova had said that Russian soldiers on the battlefield were legitimate targets for Ukraine, the assertion would be correct under international law, Denber said.""That is the Geneva Conventions,"" she added.International law governing war allows for the use of lethal force against clearly identified enemy combatants in certain situations.At the trial, prosecutors gave details of messages and images on Buyanova's mobile phone that did not relate to the dispute with Akinshina but were used to present a picture of someone with pro-Ukrainian and anti-Russian views.The defence said someone else had used the device and the messages weren't hers.In her final speech at the summing-up, the doctor was tearful. She asked the court to take into account her age, fragile health and decades of service.Supporters in tee-shirts printed with Buyanova's unassuming image shouted ""shame"" at the sentencing.Before the verdict was read, Buyanova expressed shock at what was happening.""I can't get my head around it,"" she told reporters. ""Maybe I will later.""","Nadezhda Buyanova, 68, sentenced to five-and-a-half years in a penal colony.

"Nasa says Sunita Williams in 'incredible health' on ISS, denies 'losing weight' talk",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/nasa-says-sunita-williams-in-incredible-health-on-iss-denies-losing-weight-talk/articleshow/115349072.cms,"Suni Williams, a Nasa astronaut on the International Space Station , is healthy and not suffering from any medical problems, Nasa's top medical officer said Thursday.The unusual pronouncement was prompted by news articles suggesting that Williams was experiencing health problems during an unplanned extended stay in orbit. That in turn set off widespread rumors on social media.Williams, 59, addressed the issue directly Tuesday during an interview with New England Sports Network. ""I think there's some rumours around outside there that I'm losing weight and stuff,"" she said. ""No, I'm actually right at the same amount.""Williams is one of the two astronauts whose stay at the space station was stretched from eight days to eight months because of propulsion problems with the Boeing Starliner spacecraft that took them there in June. While taking pains to insist that Williams and Butch Wilmore, the other astronaut, were not stranded, Nasa decided that Starliner would return to Earth empty and that Williams and Wilmore would join the space station crew until February. They are to head home on a SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft instead.A photograph that Nasa released in late September showed Williams and Wilmore making pizza on the space station. Williams' face appeared sunken and thin. An article in New York Post last week fueled speculation, quoting an anonymous Nasa employee who claimed she had lost significant body mass.The Post article said that Williams had been unable to consume enough calories to maintain her mass - the rigours of life in space include exercising a couple of hours a day to help maintain the astronauts' bones - and that Nasa doctors had spent a month working with her to regain mass.In an interview, Dr James D Polk, the chief health and medical officer for the space agency, said that was not true.""I've known Suni 20 years, and I'll tell you, Suni looks the same to me,"" he said. ""She's in incredible health right now.""Polk said all the American astronauts on the space station were doing well.

A whistleblower report on the U.S. government's secret UAP (Unidentified Aerial Phenomena) program was made public, sparking a renewed discussion about the existence of extraterrestrial life and the potential government cover-ups surrounding these phenomena. The report, titled Immaculate Constellation, was released by Representative Nancy Mace and presented during a Congressional hearing held on the same day.The hearing was titled “Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth”, and it addressed several pressing questions about UAPs: Are we being observed by intelligent extraterrestrial life? Has the U.S. government been concealing evidence about UAPs? Has the government recovered any non-human biological materials from UAPs? And most critically, does the U.S. possess any UAPs?In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Representative Mace raised pointed questions: “If UAPs don’t exist, why are taxpayer dollars being spent on something that isn’t real? And if they do exist, why is this information being deliberately hidden from the public?” These questions set the stage for an intense session where whistleblowers testified, some making alarming claims about the U.S. government's handling of UAP data and technology.The hearing featured testimony from four key figures—Luis Elizondo, a former Department of Defense official; Tim Gallaudet, a retired rear admiral of the U.S. Navy; Michael Shellenberger, a journalist and founder of Public news outlet; and Michael Gold, a former NASA official. All four agreed that the U.S. government is deliberately concealing information about UAPs. They suggested that certain UAPs could represent non-human intelligence and that the U.S. might possess advanced technologies that are not of this world.At a recent UAP hearing , Luis Elizondo, a key advocate for UAP transparency, firmly stated that ""UAPs are real"" and described how these phenomena, potentially linked to non-human intelligence, are monitoring sensitive military sites globally. He argued that the U.S. government has recovered UAP technologies, and other nations may possess them, while criticising the secrecy surrounding UAP programs.Retired Navy rear admiral Tim Gallaudet shared his 2015 encounter with a UAP during a naval exercise, highlighting the ""Go Fast"" video that showed an object exhibiting flight characteristics beyond known military technology. He emphasised that key UAP information is hidden in classified programs.Journalist Michael Shellenberger referred to comments by Presidents Trump and Obama, both suggesting the U.S. government holds undisclosed UAP information. He called for bipartisan transparency, arguing that the public has a right to know the truth, especially if UAPs pose a national security threat.Michael Gold, a former NASA official, highlighted the stigma that has long surrounded discussions of UAPs. He called on government agencies and the scientific community to overcome this stigma and open up to the possibility of scientific inquiry into the nature of UAPs. Gold echoed the famous phrase, “The truth is out there,” urging society to be brave enough to confront the possibility that humanity might not be alone in the universe.The 2024 hearing on Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs) built on earlier testimonies from military figures, including retired Navy pilot Ryan Graves and intelligence officer David Grusch, who had previously shared their experiences with UAPs.Graves, a former F/A-18 pilot, described multiple encounters with UAPs exhibiting advanced capabilities like supersonic speeds and the ability to hover in strong winds. He highlighted an incident in 2014 near Virginia Beach, where he and other pilots observed a mysterious object — a dark grey or black cube within a clear sphere — performing impossible manoeuvres. Graves raised concerns about underreporting and the withholding of critical information on these phenomena.David Grusch, a retired intelligence officer who had worked on the UAP task force, made explosive claims, stating that the U.S. government possessed crashed UAPs and potentially non-human biological material. Grusch revealed that he had interviewed over 40 witnesses and uncovered a multi-decade program focused on retrieving and reverse-engineering UAPs. He also suggested that some individuals had been harmed or threatened to suppress information on these technologies.Retired Navy Commander David Fravor recounted his famous 2004 encounter with a Tic-Tac-shaped UAP off the coast of California, which was later captured in Pentagon-released footage. Fravor described the UAP as having no visible flight controls and performing impossible manoeuvres, travelling at extreme speeds and defying the laws of physics. He emphasised that the object’s capabilities far surpassed anything the U.S. military currently possesses, suggesting it was not from any known nation.Fravor also emphasised that the technology witnessed in the Tic-Tac incident could represent a potential national security threat, given its capabilities far exceeded anything that the U.S. military possessed at the time. Fravor expressed awe at the object's performance but also voiced serious concerns about what it might mean for national security, warning that the technology involved could be far beyond anything the U.S. or its adversaries currently control.The testimonies of these whistleblowers, along with the release of the Immaculate Constellation report, have reignited public interest in UAPs and their potential implications for national security. While many of the questions surrounding these phenomena remain unanswered, the hearing underscored the growing demand for transparency and for the U.S. government to declassify critical data about UAPs. The revelations have set the stage for what could be a significant shift in our understanding of not just UAPs, but also the broader cosmic context in which humanity exists. The truth, as these whistleblowers have insisted, may well be out there—waiting to be uncovered.","The 2024 hearing on Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs) built on earlier testimonies from military figures, including retired Navy pilot Ryan Graves and intelligence officer David Grusch.

Why is Donald Trump's pick for Pentagon Pete Hegseth labelled as ‘insider threat’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/why-is-donald-trumps-pick-for-pentagon-pete-hegseth-labelled-as-insider-threat/articleshow/115349804.cms,"Why is 'Deus Vult' associated with white supremacist and far-right groups



NEW DELHI: Pete Hegseth , the Army National Guard veteran and Fox News host picked by US president-elect Donald Trump to lead the Department of Defense, was flagged as a potential “Insider Threat” by a fellow service member.Hegseth’s tattoo of the phrase “Deus Vult,” linked to white supremacist groups, raised concerns about extremist affiliations within the military ranks.Accordint to associated press a fellow Guard member who was the unit’s security manager and on an anti-terrorism team at the time, shared an email he sent to the unit’s leadership flagging a different tattoo reading “Deus Vult” that’s been used by white supremacists, concerned it was an indication of an “Insider Threat.”Hegseth has argued that he was unfairly targeted, asserting that the tattoo’s symbolism was misinterpreted. He has also criticised the Pentagon ’s efforts to tackle extremism within the military, saying such steps reflect a baseless, exaggerated issue.Since the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, Hegseth has downplayed both the violence and the involvement of military-trained individuals, stating on a Fox News panel that the crowd were “people who love our country” and who “love freedom.”However, the Pentagon responded with alarm as individuals in tactical gear moved in military-style formations on the Capitol steps. Among those facing the most serious charges from the insurrection, eight of the 14 convicted for seditious conspiracy had prior military service. More than 20 of the military-related individuals arrested were actively serving at the time, according to data from the University of Maryland’s START consortium.In his recent book, The War on Warriors, Hegseth maintained that only “a handful” of active-duty soldiers and reservists were present at the Capitol that day, ignoring the larger number of military veterans involved in the insurrection. He has described the Pentagon’s counter-extremism efforts as “fake” and “manufactured,” asserting it has pushed “rank-and-file patriots out of their formations.”Hegseth’s potential leadership could introduce a stark contrast at the Department of Defense. He would oversee an institution committed to tackling extremist influence within its ranks while continuing to claim that the issue is overblown and used to “peddle the lie of racism in the military.”The phrase ""Deus Vult,"" meaning ""God wills it"" in Latin, originated during the First Crusade in 1095 as a rallying cry for Christian soldiers who aimed to reclaim Jerusalem from Muslim rule. The phrase historically conveyed a sense of divine mission or purpose, but in modern times, it has been adopted by some white supremacist and far-right groups, who use it as a symbol of a perceived clash between ""Western"" (Christian) and ""Eastern"" (Islamic) cultures.White supremacist groups have co-opted ""Deus Vult"" to evoke the imagery of the Crusades as a justification for racist and xenophobic ideologies, portraying their cause as a similar battle to ""protect"" Western civilization. This modern usage distorts the original context of the phrase, turning it into a slogan for exclusionary, extremist beliefs.This association has made ""Deus Vult"" a contentious phrase in online spaces, especially in communities working to identify and counter hate speech, where it’s recognized as a dog whistle for far-right extremism.Also read: 'Democrats think this is Swastika': Row over chest tattoo of Trump's secretary of defense Pete Hegseth","Pete Hegseth was flagged as a potential “Insider Threat” by a fellow service member.

The United States of America has announced the return of over 1,400 looted artifacts worth nearly $10 million to India, according to a press statement by Manhattan district attorney’s office.The stolen antiquities which are being returned include a sandstone sculpture of a Celestial Dancer, stolen from a temple in Madhya Pradesh, in the early 1980s. It was looted and divided in two to make it easier to smuggle and sell.Professionally reassembled, the sculpture was later donated to the Metropolitan Museum of Art by one of Kapoor’s clients. The Celestial Dancer remained on display at the Met until it was finally seized by the Art Theft Unit (ATU) in 2023.“Today’s repatriation marks another victory in what has been a multi-year, international investigation into antiquities trafficked by one of history’s most prolific offenders. HSI New York and our colleagues at the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office have worked tirelessly with our partners in India and beyond to disrupt and dismantle the smuggling networks and in turn recover these invaluable pieces,” said HSI New York special agent in charge William S Walker in the statement.The recovered pieces were part of multiple ongoing investigations into criminal trafficking networks, including those tied to alleged antiquities trafficker Subhash Kapoor and convicted trafficker Nancy Wiener. The probe has found five individuals guilty.","The United States of America has announced the return of over 1,400 looted artifacts worth nearly $10 million to India.

Chinese hackers target US telecoms in major cyber-espionage operation: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/chinese-hackers-target-us-telecoms-in-major-cyber-espionage-operation-report/articleshow/115349500.cms,"A major cyber-espionage campaign linked to Chinese state-sponsored hackers has targeted several US telecommunications companies , including T-Mobile , Reuters reported quoting the Wall Street Journal.The FBI and the cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency (CISA) issued a joint statement revealing that hackers, believed to be affiliated with the Chinese government, compromised the networks of multiple telecom providers.Their goal was to obtain sensitive information, particularly from individuals involved in US government or political activities, the report said. While the FBI did not disclose the identities of the affected individuals, it confirmed that most of them were likely linked to political or governmental work.The hackers accessed customer call records and potentially intercepted private communications, although there is no evidence so far that customer data has been significantly impacted, as per the WSJ report. T-Mobile, one of the companies affected, has reassured its users that it is closely monitoring the situation and that no personal information appears to have been compromised.The FBI also noted that the hackers targeted data related to US law enforcement surveillance, suggesting that they were attempting to compromise sensitive programs such as those authorised under the foreign intelligence surveillance act (FISA).This cyber-attack follows a series of similar incidents attributed to Chinese hackers . Earlier this year, US authorities exposed a large-scale hacking operation, codenamed ""Flax Typhoon,"" in which malicious software was installed on over 200,000 consumer devices, including home routers and security cameras, creating a vast botnet.Furthermore, Chinese hackers have previously targeted the personal devices of political figures, including presidential candidates and high-ranking officials, raising further concerns about the scope of Chinese cyber-espionage efforts.While the Chinese government has consistently denied involvement in such activities, US officials have linked these attacks to broader state-sponsored campaigns aimed at stealing technological, political, and intelligence data.The FBI and CISA are working with telecommunications companies to strengthen defences against future intrusions, and investigations are ongoing to determine the full extent of the breach.","Hackers believed to be affiliated with the Chinese government.

The toxic smog affecting Lahore and other parts of Pakistan has worsened, with more than 15,000 cases of respiratory and viral infections reported in a single day, Ary News reported on Thursday.According to Swiss group IQAir, Lahore’s pollution index reached a staggering 1165, while New Delhi and surrounding areas hovered around 350.Hospitals in Lahore are experiencing an influx of patients presenting symptoms including dry cough, respiratory distress, pneumonia, and chest infections.The primary government healthcare facilities have recorded substantial patient numbers: Mayo Hospital attended to over 4,000 individuals, Jinnah Hospital treated 3,500 patients, Gangaram Hospital received 3,000 cases, and Children's Hospital managed more than 2,000 patients.Healthcare professionals in Pakistan have highlighted the increased risk to children and individuals with underlying conditions such as asthma and cardiac ailments, Ary News reported.The atmospheric pollution has triggered a surge in various ailments, including pneumonia, chest infections, and dermatological conditions.The World Health Organization (WHO) warns that air pollution can lead to strokes, heart disease, lung cancer, and respiratory issues. Children, babies, and the elderly are especially vulnerable to these health risks.PM2.5, the fine particulate matter that poses the greatest danger, is the chief pollutant in Lahore’s air. It originates from fossil fuel combustion, dust storms, and wildfires, and has been linked to asthma, heart and lung disease, cancer, and cognitive impairment in children.Pakistani authorities are implementing comprehensive measures to address this environmental crisis. According to Pakistani media outlets, the Punjab Provincial Disaster Management Authority of Pakistan officially classified smog as a ""calamity"" and implemented emergency protocols.The pollution, mainly caused by industrial emissions, vehicle exhaust, and agricultural stubble burning, has triggered health emergencies. As a result, schools have been closed, outdoor activities banned, and significant health concerns are mounting. The hazardous air poses serious risks, especially to children, the elderly, and those with respiratory conditions.Also read: Pakistan restricts outdoor activities, market hours to curb air pollution-related illness The government's response includes a three-month ban on wedding celebrations and new transport department regulations to combat smog across the province. Additionally, the Pakistan Punjab administration has suspended educational activities in schools and colleges.In Multan, located about 350 kilometres from Lahore, the AQI reached an even more alarming 2,000. In response, authorities have banned access to parks, zoos, and other public spaces, along with polluting tuk-tuks and restaurants using unfiltered barbecues.The extensive smog covering northern Pakistan has been documented by NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS).""A thick blanket of sky-soiling smog hung over northern Pakistan in early November 2024, causing air quality to plummet, schools to close, and sending hundreds of people to the hospital"", NASA MODIS said.""On November 12, the Punjab government website advised that the AQI for the province over the last 24 hours had averaged 604-well into the Hazardous range"", it added.NASA MODIS described the severe pollution, stating that, ""The tan haze is so thick that it completely obscures the landscape of Pakistan from view. Irregular patches of a lighter color indicate that fog hugs the ground underneath the haze. The city of Lahore, Pakistan--which has ranked as the most polluted city in the world in recent days--is located near the northeastern edge of the fog"".","Hospitals in Lahore are experiencing an influx of patients presenting symptoms including dry cough, respiratory distress, pneumonia, and chest infections.

China pushing to deploy its own security staff to protect citizens in Pak: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/china-pushing-to-deploy-its-own-security-staff-to-protect-citizens-in-pak-report/articleshow/115235972.cms,"File photo

Beijing is pushing Pakistan to allow its own security staff to provide protection to thousands of Chinese citizens working in the South Asian nation, during talks after a car bombing in Karachi that was seen as a major security breach, sources said.Last month’s airport bombing in the southern port city that killed two Chinese engineers returning to work on a project after a holiday in Thailand was the latest in a string of attacks on Beijing’s interests in Pakistan. The attacks, and Islamabad’s failure to deter them, have angered China, which has pushed Pakistan to begin formal negotiations for a joint security management system .Reuters spoke to five Pakistani security and govt sources with direct knowledge of the previously unreported negotiations, and reviewed a written proposal sent by Beijing to Islamabad. “They (Chinese) want to bring in their own security,” said one official, who sat in on a recent meeting, adding that Pa kistan had not so far agreed to such a step.A written proposal sent to Islamabad by Beijing, and forwarded to Pakistani security agencies for review, mentioned a clause allowing the dispatching of security agencies and military forces into each others’ territory to assist in counter-terrorism missions and conduct joint strikes. The dispatching would be done after discussions, but Pakistani agencies were averse to the proposal, one official said.Neither Beijing nor Islama bad confirmed the talks officially. The source, and two other officials, said there was a consensus on setting up a joint security management system, and that Pakistan was amenable to Chinese officials sitting in on security meetings and co-ordination. But there was no agreement on their participating in security arrangements on the ground. The first official said Pakistan had asked China for help in improving its intelligence and surveillance capabilities instead of direct involvement.The nature of the Karachi bombing has angered Beijing: A pick-up truck rigged with nearly 100 kg of explosives waited unchecked for 40 minutes near the outermost security cordon of the heavily guarded airport before its driver rammed it into the vehicle carrying Chinese engineers, officials said. “It was agrave security breach,” admitted one of the officials investigating the blast. Investigators believe the attackers had “inside help” in securing details of the itinerary and route.","Beijing is pushing Pakistan to allow its own security staff to provide protection to thousands of Chinese citizens working in the South Asian nation.

He urged the Pakistan government to take immediate action to curb the worsening air pollution and protect these vulnerable populations.Fadil, in a statement, said, ""I am extremely concerned about the well-being of young children who are forced to breathe polluted, toxic air. Over 11 million children under five years of age are exposed to this smog in the worst-affected districts.""He noted that even before this year’s record-breaking smog, 12% of deaths in children under five in Pakistan were attributed to air pollution—a number likely to increase with the ongoing crisis.Fadil warned of the additional risks to expectant mothers, stating that exposure to polluted air increases the likelihood of premature births, respiratory complications, and low birth weight. ""When pregnant women are exposed to polluted air, they are more likely to give birth prematurely, face respiratory issues, and their babies may have a low birth weight. We cannot afford to let our babies breathe toxic air. We cannot let the health, education, and well-being of millions of children suffer,"" he said.Calling on the government for immediate intervention, Fadil said that clean air is a fundamental right for every child, highlighting the urgency of protective measures to safeguard the health of Pakistan's youngest citizens amidst this crisis.Dawn reported that Punjab's Air Quality Index (AQI) has surged to critical levels, with seven districts, including Sialkot, registering AQI readings above 400 and one district reaching a staggering 774.In response to this escalating public health emergency, local authorities have temporarily closed schools until November 17. Residents are also being restricted from public parks, zoos, playgrounds, and museums to limit their exposure to the dangerous smog levels.The Unicef office in Islamabad highlighted that cities like Lahore and Multan are recording unprecedented levels of air pollution, with hospitals admitting numerous patients affected by the toxic air, including dozens of young children.","Unicef representative in Pakistan Abdullah Fadil warned of severe health risks facing around 11 million children.

The 'establishment'



Not the first time

More changes



The recent amendment to the Pakistan Army Act, which extends the tenure of the Chief of Army Staff (COAS) from three to five years, has sparked significant debate and concern regarding the implications for civil-military relations in Pakistan .This legislative change, hastily approved by the ruling coalition led by PM Shehbaz Sharif's PML-N, not only lengthens the term of the army chief but also removes the retirement age limit for four-star generals, effectively allowing military leaders to remain in power indefinitely.The amendment allows the current COAS, General Asim Munir , who was appointed in November 2022 and was set to retire in 2025, to potentially serve until 2027 or longer if further extensions are granted. This change is seen as a continuation of a trend where military leaders have managed to extend their tenures beyond traditional limits.The amendment was moved by defence minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif and received majority support despite strong opposition protests from the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, led by former PM Imran Khan.The PTI lawmakers criticised the expedited process of passing such crucial legislation without adequate debate, arguing that it undermines democratic principles in a country already grappling with political instabilityThe removal of the retirement age limit for the army chief raises critical concerns about the balance of power between civilian governance and military authority in Pakistan.Critics argue that this move consolidates military power at a time when civilian institutions are already perceived as weak. The ability for an army chief to remain in power indefinitely could lead to a scenario where military influence over political affairs becomes even more pronounced, effectively sidelining elected representatives.Michael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center, noted that such legislative actions transform the legislative into a ""rubber stamp"", thereby diminishing democratic governance.The Pakistan army has been a dominant force in the country's political landscape since its inception in 1947, often overshadowing elected governments.The military's involvement in politics began almost immediately, with its first significant intervention occurring in 1958 when General Muhammad Ayub Khan led a coup against the civilian government, citing corruption and inefficiency.Since that initial coup, the army has directly ruled the country for about 36 years, while also exerting considerable influence during periods of civilian rule.Major coups occurred under Ayub Khan (1958), Yahya Khan (1969), and Zia-ul-Haq (1977), each time justifying military rule as necessary for national stability.The military's rationale often centered around restoring order amid political chaos, which has led to a cycle of governance where elected officials frequently find themselves subordinate to military interests.The intertwining of military and political affairs has given rise to what analysts describe as the ""establishment"" or ""deep state"", where the military operates behind the scenes to influence policy decisions even when not in direct control.This dynamic has allowed the army to maintain significant control over key areas such as foreign policy, security, and economic management. For instance, during recent political upheavals, including the ousting of former Prime Minister Imran Khan in 2022, the military played a crucial role in shaping political outcomes.Elected governments have often been compelled to align their policies with military interests.Political leaders are acutely aware that their tenure could be jeopardized by military intervention if they stray too far from the army's preferences. This has led to a pattern where civilian governments consult with military leaders on critical issues, particularly those involving national security and foreign relations. The recent amendments to extend the tenure of the Chief of Army Staff reflect this ongoing power dynamic, allowing military leadership to exert even greater influence over governance without the constraints of a retirement age.In defense of the amendments, government officials have argued that extending military tenures is essential for maintaining stability and continuity in Pakistan's security leadership amid regional tensions. They contend that allowing military chiefs to serve longer terms will enable them to address national security challenges without disruptions caused by frequent leadership changes.Supporters of the amendment also claim that aligning military leadership tenures with other constitutional offices—many of which have five-year terms—provides a rational framework for governance.The legislative change is not unprecedented in Pakistan's history.Previous army chiefs have also enjoyed extended tenures through similar amendments or political maneuvering.General Qamar Javed Bajwa had his term extended multiple times during his tenure from 2016 to 2022.The pattern of extending military leadership has become almost standard practice, raising questions about accountability and oversight within Pakistan's political system.Observers note that General Munir's potential extended tenure could mirror historical figures like General Zia-ul-Haq, whose prolonged rule led to widespread discontent among both military ranks and civilians due to perceived mismanagement and authoritarian practices.The removal of age limits and potential for indefinite extensions could lead to a scenario where future army chiefs similarly consolidate power.Moreover, there are concerns that these changes may pave the way for further legal amendments aimed at consolidating military power across other branches of government.For instance, recent discussions around increasing the number of Supreme Court judges could be interpreted as an attempt to ensure favorable judicial outcomes for military interests.","The Pakistan army has been a dominant force in the country's political landscape since its inception in 1947.

Pakistan's Punjab province has introduced strict measures to combat rising illnesses caused by severe air pollution. Starting Monday, most outdoor activities are banned, and shops, markets, and malls in certain areas are required to close early.This move follows an earlier decision to shut down educational institutions and public spaces like parks and zoos in Lahore and nearby districts until November 17.Lahore, which has been ranked as the world's most polluted city by Swiss air quality monitor IQAir, recently recorded an Air Quality Index (AQI) of over 600, significantly lower than the alarming 1,900 it reached earlier in the month. For context, an AQI between 0-50 is considered 'good'.The worsening air quality has led to a sharp increase in cases of respiratory diseases, eye irritation, and conjunctivitis in districts like Lahore, Multan, Faisalabad, and Gujranwala.The Punjab government noted an unprecedented rise in patients suffering from these conditions, attributing the spread of pink eye disease to dust, smoke, and chemical exposure.As part of the new restrictions, outdoor sports events, exhibitions, and festivals have been prohibited, while essential religious activities remain exempt. Pharmacies, dairy shops, and vegetable outlets are allowed to operate until 8 pm (local time).The pollution crisis has been particularly severe in Lahore, where thick smog has caused reduced visibility, leading to road accidents. In one incident, nine people were injured on GT Road when a van collided with a parked truck due to the dense haze.Authorities in Multan are facing even more critical conditions, with the AQI reaching over 2,000 last Friday. The concentration of PM2.5 particles, a harmful pollutant known to cause severe respiratory issues, was recorded at 947 micrograms per cubic meter, which is nearly 190 times higher than World Health Organization guidelines.Critics have pointed out that the government has been slow to enforce preventive measures, with many residents seen without masks despite the hazardous air quality.Authorities have blamed cross-border winds from India for exacerbating the smog, claiming that pollutants drifting from across the border have worsened the air quality in Pakistan’s Punjab province. The Punjab government has expressed its intention to take up the issue with Indian authorities through diplomatic channels.","Pakistan's Punjab province has introduced strict measures to combat rising illnesses caused by severe air pollution.

LAHORE: Pakistan's Punjab province banned most outdoor activities and ordered shops, markets and malls in some areas to close early from Monday to curb illnesses caused by intense air pollution.The province has already closed educational institutions and public spaces like parks and zoos until Nov. 17 in places including Lahore, the world's most polluted city in terms of air quality according to Swiss group IQAir's live ratings.The districts of Lahore, Multan, Faisalabad, and Gujranwala have seen an unprecedented rise in patients with respiratory diseases, eye and throat irritation, and pink eye disease, the Punjab government said in an order issued late on Sunday.The new restrictions would also remain in force until Nov. 17, it said.""The spread of conjunctivitis/ pink eye disease due to bacterial or viral infection, smoke, dust or chemical exposure is posing a serious and imminent threat to public health,"" it said.While outdoor activities including outdoor sports events, exhibitions and festivals, and outdoor dining at restaurants have been prohibited, ""unavoidable religious rites"" are exempt from this direction, the order said.Some outlets like pharmacies, oil depots, dairy shops, and fruit and vegetable shops have similarly been exempted from the directions to close by 8 p.m. local time.Lahore's air quality remained hazardous on Monday, with an index score of more than 600, according to IQAir, but this was significantly lower than the 1,900 that it touched in some places earlier this month.A score of 0-50 is considered 'good'.Several parts of South Asia are engulfed by a toxic haze each winter as cold air traps dust, emissions, and smoke from farm fires.Punjab has blamed its particularly toxic air this year on pollution wafting in from India, where northern parts have also been battling hazardous air, and has said it will take the issue up with the neighbouring country through its foreign ministry.India's Supreme Court on Monday directed the Delhi government to decide by Nov. 25 on imposing a 'perpetual ban' on firecrackers, legal news portal Bar and Bench reported.Firecrackers set off by revellers on Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights that was celebrated on Oct. 31 this year despite a ban, has aggravated the region's pollution problem.","Pakistan's Punjab province has banned most outdoor activities and ordered shops, markets and malls in some areas to close early.

Users described difficulties connecting, with VPN Unlimited showing a peak of reported problems at around 6:15 pm and TunnelBear users noting connectivity issues into the evening.For many Pakistanis, VPNs are a vital tool for accessing blocked sites, including X (formerly Twitter), which has been restricted due to national security concerns. This recent wave of connectivity issues has reignited discussions over digital freedom and government policies limiting online access.Prime Minister Sharif's recent tweet congratulating Trump for his second term win garnered significant attention for both its content and the reaction it received. In his message, Sharif wrote, ""Congratulations to President-elect Donald Trump on his historic victory for a second term! I look forward to working closely with the incoming administration to further strengthen and broaden the Pakistan-US partnership.” However, X attached a community note to the tweet, pointing out that Sharif himself had banned X in Pakistan and was likely using a VPN to access the platform, which is “unlawful under Pakistani law.”This community note intensified debates over VPN usage in the country, with some citizens arguing that restrictive internet policies compel even government officials to bypass their own regulations. Another note was attached to a subsequent tweet by Sharif, congratulating Pakistan’s cricket team.In February, X was banned in Pakistan, with authorities citing “national security concerns” and non-compliance with local laws as justification. Despite the restrictions, X remains a key platform for official statements from the government.Last August, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) announced plans to scrutinise VPN services in the country, aiming to limit access to only those services that align with government regulations.

However, loans are still necessary to service existing debts, most of which are owed to Western financial institutions.The country had anticipated raising $3.2 billion against the $2.5 billion in debt needs since IMF’s approval of a $7 billion package for Pakistan in September. This included a $1.2 billion Saudi oil facility.As per sources, no agreement has been reached regarding the Saudi oil facility, five months into the fiscal year.Each month of delay reduces available funds by $100 million within the fiscal year. Pakistani authorities remain optimistic about convincing Riyadh to extend the facility. However, finance ministry spokesperson Qumar Abbasi did not respond to queries regarding the status of the $1.2 billion oil facility.Apart from IMP, Pakistan is also seeking a $1 billion loan from Dubai Islamic Bank, while requesting China to reschedule $3.4 billion in debt from China's Export-Import (Exim) Bank.Out of this amount, approximately $750 million is due in the current fiscal year. The rescheduling of this debt has been included in the country's external financing plans, as per sources.Due to its weakened financial position and the constraints imposed by the IMF agreement, Pakistan lacks the flexibility to repay its debt to China.Around $3.9 billion, of the total $6.5 billion in Chinese commercial debt, is due in the current fiscal year. The government successfully rolled over a $200 million debt that matured in September. However, sources suggest that no progress has been made in arranging another rollover, with a $1 billion payment due in March 2025.As part of its $3.2 billion plan, the government also secured Pakistan's most expensive loan in history—a $600 million facility from Standard Chartered Bank. The finance minister stated that this facility would not be utilized, while the IMF distanced itself from the loan arrangement.IMF's unexpected visit comes just six weeks after the loan's approval and four months before the planned review, which will evaluate performance against the July-September targets and assess progress for the October-December 2024 quarter.Official figures show a tax collection shortfall of Rs 190 billion over the past four months, with the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) collecting Rs 3.440 trillion, against a target of Rs 3.632 trillion, despite record-high taxes this year.",IMF's unexpected visit comes just six weeks after the loan's approval and four months before the planned review.

According to Swiss air quality monitor IQAir, Lahore’s AQI rose to 760, while Multan reached a staggering 1,914, making it one of the most polluted cities worldwide.The extreme pollution has left authorities scrambling to control the smog, with limited success reported.Lahore, under a thick blanket of smog for days, has witnessed widespread road closures due to low visibility, leading to multiple accidents. A serious incident on GT Road near Kalashah Kako saw nine people injured when a van collided with a stationary truck, its driver unable to see the parked vehicle through the dense haze.The smog has also forced Lahore high court to mandate a shutdown of all trade activities by 8 pm and close markets on Sundays, aiming to minimize pollution-inducing activity.In Multan, conditions reached what experts called ""apocalyptic"" levels, with the AQI exceeding 2,000 on Friday morning. The concentration of PM2.5—a hazardous particulate matter known to cause severe respiratory and cardiovascular issues—was recorded at 947 micrograms per cubic meter, nearly 190 times above World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. The WHO deems PM2.5 levels above five micrograms per cubic meter harmful.In response, the state government is on high alert, implementing emergency measures to curb pollution levels. Public parks and museums across major cities have been closed until at least November 17.Authorities have also faced criticism for failing to enforce preemptive anti-smog directives, with citizens often seen without masks despite the severe air quality.Multan, the largest city in southern Punjab, recorded an extremely dangerous Air Quality Index (AQI) of 2,135 between 8am and 9am on Friday, according to data from IQAir, as reported by Dawn. Later in the day, the AQI readings remained perilous, reaching 980 by 10 pm—more than three times above the “hazardous” threshold of 300. Several monitors across Multan, including those at the WWF-Pakistan Office, Shamsabad Colony, and Multan Cantonment, showed AQI levels as high as 2,316, 1,635, and 1,527 respectively.Authorities in Pakistan have attributed the worsening air quality in Lahore to cross-border winds carrying pollutants from neighboring India, alleging that these winds have pushed smog levels to ""dangerous"" extremes.","Pakistan's Air Quality Index (AQI) has soared to unprecedented levels, sparking alarm across Punjab province.

"India welcomes Sri Lanka president mandate, reiterates invitation",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/india-welcomes-sri-lanka-president-mandate-reiterates-invitation/articleshow/115343783.cms,"As President Anura Dissanayake of Sri Lanka consolidated his position with a thumping majority for his leftist coalition in Parliament, India welcomed the development while reaffirming its commitment to working with the island neighbour for mutual benefit.The Indian government reiterated its invitation for the president to visit India at an early date as Indian high commissioner Santosh Jha called on Dissanayake shortly after the outcome of the snap polls became clear. Jha was the first foreign dignitary to meet Dissanayake also after the latter was elected president in September this year.With 159 seats and 61 percent of the votes, the coalition, National People’s Power (NPP), won a landslide 2-3rd majority in the 225-member Parliament, cementing Dissanayake’s position as president. The alliance, led by Dissanayake’s Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) party, had only 3 seats in the outgoing Parliament.“As a fellow democracy, India welcomes the mandate and remains committed to further strengthening bilateral ties for the benefit of our peoples,’’ said the Indian high commission in a post on X, after Jha’s meeting with the president. Significantly, despite the Sinhala nationalism associated with the JVP, the Dissanayake-led alliance even outperformed Tamil parties in the north, including in the Tamil stronghold of Jaffna.Jha is learnt to have reiterated PM Narendra Modi’s invitation to Dissanayake to visit India at a mutually convenient date. The invitation had been delivered by external affairs minister S Jaishankar when he met the president last month.Jaishankar visited Sri Lanka barely a fortnight after the presidential polls, becoming the first foreign minister to call on the president. His visit signalled that Dissanayake, despite his party’s traditionally anti-India position, was responding positively to India’s efforts to reach out to him that saw the government hosting him here in February.In his meeting with Jaishankar in October, Dissanayake assured him that Lankan territory would never be allowed to be used in a manner inimical to India’s security interests. The president was said to have acknowledged the importance of efforts to promote trust, transparency and mutual sensitivity. This is important for India in the context of Sri Lanka’s growing ties with China even as, according to both governments, Indian and Lankan security interests remain intertwined.With Jaishankar assuring him that India will continue to prioritise its ongoing developmental assistance for Sri Lanka, Dissanayake had told him India’s economic support is critical to realising his vision of a prosperous Sri Lanka and for meeting the aspirations of the people.However, while Dissanayake has recognised the potential of export of renewable energy to India that could help reduce production costs in his country, India remains concerned about his pre-election threat to scrap a wind power project of the Adani group because of environmental issues. The president sees the project as violating Sri Lanka’s “energy sovereignty” and his government told the Supreme Court last month that it is reconsidering the approval granted to it by the previous government. It also said that the final decision will be conveyed to the court after the parliamentary polls and installation of the new cabinet.",President Anura Dissanayake of Sri Lanka consolidated his position with a thumping majority for his leftist coalition in Parliament.

Sri Lanka election results: President Dissanayake’s NPP claims landslide victory,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/sri-lanka-election-results-president-dissanayakes-npp-party-secures-parliament-majority/articleshow/115324254.cms,"Sri Lanka President's NPP party wins

The National People's Power (NPP) party led by Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake achieved a landslide victory on Friday in the parliamentary snap elections.The president's strategic decision to call for immediate elections proved successful, with the leftist coalition securing at least 123 seats in the 225-member assembly, according to the Sri Lanka election commission website.The party, previously held only three seats in the parliament, which led to his decision to dissolve the assembly and call for fresh elections.Dissanayake, who identifies as a Marxist, had been chosen as the President in September after promising to address corruption and retrieve misappropriated assets.Initial counting showed the coalition commanding 62 per cent of votes from more than three-quarters of counted ballots, significantly outperforming opposition leader Sajith Premadasa's party, which received only 18 per cent.""People voted to get rid of corruption and a corrupt system,"" IT professional Chanaka Rajapaksha, who supported the NPP in the polls, told AFP on Friday.Diisanayake had been confident in the party's win. ""We see this as a critical turning point for Sri Lanka. We expect a mandate to form a strong parliament, and we are confident the people will give us this mandate,"" he said after casting his vote on Thursday. ""There is a change in Sri Lanka's political culture that started in September, which must continue.""Dissanayake's NPP, founded in 2019, strived to secure two-third majority to implement key anti-poverty reforms and tackle economic challenges following Sri Lanka’s severe financial crisis. This crisis led to the ousting of former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa in 2022 and prompted a $2.9 billion IMF bailout.Dissanayake, who won the presidency in September, faced opposition from Sajith Premadasa's United People's Power and conservative factions. This win for NPP marks the first time a leftist coalition controls both the presidency and parliament, potentially shifting Sri Lanka’s policies toward a socialist approach and redefining its international relations, particularly with China and India.In Sri Lanka's parliamentary system, 196 out of the total 225 seats were contested under the country’s proportional representative electoral system. This electoral method distributes seats within each district amongst political parties based on their vote share. The additional 29 positions, designated as national list seats, are distributed to parties and independent groups in accordance with their overall proportion of votes received across the country.",President Anura Kumara Dissanayake's National People's Power (NPP) party won at least 123 seats in the 225-member assembly.

Bangladesh Journalist Killings: Bangladesh: What's behind the spike in journalist killings?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-whats-behind-the-spike-in-journalist-killings/articleshow/115321154.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: AP)

Lack of safety gear and training

Press freedom a major concern

Seeking justice remains an uphill battle

Mehedi Hasan , a Dhaka Times journalist, was killed on July 18 after being shot while covering a clash between law enforcement officials and anti-government protesters in theBangladeshicapital's southern Jatra Bari area.On the same day, Nadia Sharmeen , a reporter for Ekattor TV, was wounded by police gunfire.Attacks on media professionals rose particularly in July amid massive and intense student-led anti-government demonstrations that led to the ouster of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.Hundreds were killed in the unrest that began as a protest over government jobs and morphed into a large-scale revolt against the former prime minister's increasingly autocratic administration. Hasina eventually fled to India.Local media report that eight journalists have been killed in the South Asian country so far this year and hundreds wounded, the highest figure over the past decade.Reporter Nadia Sharmeen says the nationwide crackdown that led to her being wounded was the most brutal she had ever experienced.""They were shooting people everywhere around,"" she told DW. ""I survived luckily due to the safety gear I had on. But Mehedi was covering this violent protest without any safety gear. Maybe he would be alive today if he had gotten a bullet-proof vest and a helmet from his media house.""Sharmeen said many media outlets in Bangladesh did not provide safety gear for journalists even if they were working in conflict situations.Ibrahim Khalilullah, a journalist who has worked for various television stations for the past 10 years, shared a similar view.""Reporters are often sent to high-risk areas without essential protective gear. Also, many journalists lack basic safety knowledge on how to protect themselves while reporting on such events,"" he said. ""The lack of preparation poses a serious risk to their safety,"" he added.Bangladesh currently ranks 165 out of 180 in the World Press Freedom Index , the country's lowest ranking ever.And press freedom hasn't improved since the interim administration led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus came to power.Many legal cases have been filed against journalists accused of aiding and abetting the Hasina government's crackdown on anti-government demonstrators. Critics say the cases are not evidence-based and could set a bad precedent.The caretaker government also recently revoked press accreditations for 167 journalists.The targeting of journalists has raised significant concerns and drawn widespread criticism from rights groups.The interim administration, however, has maintained that it is committed to ensuring media freedom.Shafiqul Alam, the interim leader's press secretary, told DW that the administration was carrying out investigations into those killed during the anti-Hasina unrest.He stressed that media organizations must also reflect on their role in protecting journalists, especially when reporting in conflict settings.Meanwhile, Mehedi Hasan's father Mosharrof Hossain said he was being forced to move from pillar to post to get justice. He accused the police of inaction.""I want justice for my son. And police are not filing the case even after the court has ordered them to do so. I went to the police station at least 50 times, and they kept me going in a circle.""Masud Kamal, a senior reporter, blamed the country's ineffective justice system for creating a culture of impunity.""Bangladesh's justice system is weak due to heavy political influence. There are also other factors like legal costs, which many journalists and their families cannot afford,"" he pointed out. ""Investigations aren't impartial either; everything is politically influenced, and it's getting worse.""Kamal stressed that the situation was taking a heavy toll on journalists' families.""These families suffer as crimes against journalists go unpunished. Impunity has two sides: Wealthy perpetrators hire lawyers, are emboldened to threaten others and create a climate of fear,"" he said. ""Journalists must battle the government, media owners, poverty, and threats to their own lives — all to ultimately fulfil their role as journalists.""",Bangladesh ranks 165 out of 180 in the World Press Freedom Index.

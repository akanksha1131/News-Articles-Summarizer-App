Post-Maduro Venezuela: Foreign Reporters TARGETED, Gunfire & Armed Patrols Under Delcy Rodriguez





Venezuela’s interim leader Delcy Rodriguez on Tuesday firmly rejected claims by the United States that it is now in control of the country, and also announced a week of national mourning for those killed during the US military operation that led to the capture of President Nicolas Maduro.Speaking on state television, Rodriguez said Venezuela remained sovereign and was being governed by its own people. She pushed back against statements by US President Donald Trump, who has said Washington is now “in charge” and that Venezuela will hand over millions of barrels of oil to the United States.""The government of Venezuela is in charge in our country, and no-one else,"" Rodriguez said, three days after US special forces carried out a raid in the Venezuelan capital and detained Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, who have since been taken to the United States to face trial.At the same time, Rodriguez struck a sombre tone at home. She announced seven days of mourning for those killed in the US assault, describing them as people who lost their lives defending the country.""We are a people that does not surrender, we are a people that does not give up,"" she declared, paying tribute to the ""martyrs"" of the US attacks.Venezuelan authorities confirmed that at least 23 members of the armed forces, including five generals, were killed.Cuba, a close ally, said 32 Cuban military personnel also died. Venezuela has not released an official civilian death toll, though the attorney general said there were “dozens” of civilian and military casualties.In Caracas, thousands of Maduro supporters marched through the streets, demanding his release. While some Venezuelans oppose Maduro, fear of state repression has limited public celebrations over his downfall.The constitution says that once Maduro is formally declared absent, elections must be held within 30 days, setting the stage for a deeply uncertain period ahead for the country.",Venezuela's interim leader Delcy Rodriguez firmly rejects claims by the United States that it is now in control of the country.

Sergio Jimenez found dead as family describes final moments during livestream





A 37-year-old streamer died while live on camera in Spain, and police are now checking if viewers who paid to watch him could face legal trouble. The man, Sergio Jimenez, was found dead at his family home in Vilanova i la Geltrú, near Barcelona, during the early hours of December 31.Police confirmed the death is being treated as a serious case linked to an extreme online challenge. Investigators have not ruled out expanding the probe to see if anyone may be criminally responsible for encouraging risky behavior.According to Spanish authorities, Sergio Jimenez had agreed to take part in a private, pay-per-view livestream where viewers donated money and pushed him to carry out dangerous acts over several hours. While the broadcast was still running, his younger brother discovered him unresponsive in his bedroom.A spokesperson for the Mossos d’Esquadra said:“We can confirm we are investigating the death of a 37-year-old man found lifeless at a property in Vilanova i la Geltrú in the province of Barcelona in the early hours of December 31. We are awaiting the full autopsy results and are looking into the context of this man’s death to determine whether a crime has occurred.”Sergio Jimenez lived in the home with his mother, Teresa. She told Catalan newspaper El Periodico that the family had been worried about his online activity for months.She said:“Jordi, my eldest son, who lives in the Pyrenees, warned us a couple of months ago Sergio was making these kinds of videos.”Teresa described the moment she realized something was wrong.“I got up to go to the bathroom just before 2am and saw the door to his room was ajar. I asked him what he was doing but he didn’t answer.”She added:“I tried to go in, but there were clothes or something on the bedroom floor and I couldn’t. I kept asking him from outside but he didn’t answer. I could see him kneeling on the bed, as if he were praying.”Her other son, Daniel, rushed in and called emergency services after confirming Sergio had already died.Daniel said:“There was an almost empty bottle of whisky, a couple of cans of energy drinks and a pile of cocaine on a red plate. My brother was kneeling on the floor, his head resting on the mattress. The computer was on and I could hear voices asking him if he was sleeping off his hangover.”Spanish media reported the livestream was limited to a private group, where viewers paid money and demanded more extreme actions. Police are now checking whether those payments and messages could count as encouragement of dangerous behavior under Spanish law.Also Read: Did Twitch Get Hacked?

Faye Greenwood shares how a sudden heart attack led to a life-saving heart transplant





At just 24 years old, Faye Greenwood faced a moment that changed her life forever. The social media influencer suffered a sudden heart attack while on holiday in Paris, an event that later led to her needing a heart transplant. Speaking to the BBC on July 5, Greenwood said she never imagined something “that serious” could happen to her at such a young age.The heart attack happened while she was traveling with her now-fiancé, fellow influencer Ailbhe Lower, also known online as Mr. Bruv. At first, Greenwood did not believe her symptoms were life-threatening. Like many young people, she thought heart attacks happened to older adults, not someone living a healthy life.What followed was a long and frightening medical journey filled with confusion, delays, and life-changing decisions. faye Greenwood’s story now serves as a strong reminder that heart problems can affect anyone, no matter their age or lifestyle.The ordeal began in July while Faye Greenwood was in Paris. She told the BBC that she first felt chest pain and then started vomiting. Soon after, the pain became overwhelming.She said, “I can’t really remember a lot, but I just felt I was in really bad pain, something I’ve never felt before.”Greenwood described the moment as feeling like “doom” and said it felt as if “the world was closing in.” Her fiancé, Ailbhe Lower, explained that language barriers made the situation worse. Because Greenwood was young, people did not immediately think she was having a heart attack. He said this caused a delay of nearly six and a half hours before she was admitted to a hospital.Doctors later diagnosed Greenwood with dilated cardiomyopathy. However, they said it may not have caused the heart attack, and the exact reason for it is still unknown.While recovering, doctors told Greenwood she might need to wait up to a year for a heart transplant. Instead, a donor was found much sooner. She left the hospital just over four months after being admitted. Looking back, Greenwood said, “It’s just something you never really think that you’re going to have to deal with.”The couple also faced heavy costs. Greenwood said her hospital bill was close to $19,000 (£14,000). She also had to be flown back to the UK in an air ambulance, which cost another $54,000 (£40,000). She called the financial stress “really scary,” especially since they had been saving to move out of her fiancé’s mother’s house.Lower said it felt unfair that Greenwood suffered a heart attack despite living a healthier life than him.

Candace Owens criticizes Turning Point USA, Ben Shapiro, and AmFest decisions

Erika Kirk’s BIG SLAP To Candace Owens Amid Public Fight On Charlie Kirk’s Death | ‘Egypt Not Here…’





Candace Owens is back on YouTube after a short break, and she did not hold back. In her first episode of the year, Owens shared strong views about Turning Point USA’s AmFest, held last month. Right away, she made her point clear. She said the event looked “like a convention for a pyramid scheme.” She added that the conference felt more like a fun weekend trip than a serious political gathering.AmFest took place from December 18 to 21 and featured many well-known conservative voices. The event already drew attention for different reasons, and Owens’ comments added fresh fuel to the debate. She questioned the purpose of the event and said it did not feel connected to everyday people. According to Owens, money and image mattered more than real connection.As the episode went on, her words became sharper. She spoke about visuals at the event, the people invited on stage, and what she feels this all says about the future of politics.Owens said that comedian Tim Dillon explained AmFest best when he called it a “bad reality drama.” She agreed and said the event did not feel real to most people. “I think the bird’s-eye view of AmFest is that it looked like a convention for a pyramid scheme,” Owens said.“The conference looked and felt like a weekend in Las Vegas, like Disney World for adults.”She also questioned Turning Point USA’s choices after the death of its founder, Charlie Kirk . Candace Owens criticized a tent set up at the event that reminded her of the location where Kirk was shot. She called it “ghastly to look at” and said it was a “conscious decision.” Owens claimed the tent was approved by Michael McCoy’s wife and said there was “no way Erika Kirk did not know.”Later, Owens spoke about the future in a striking way. “I feel like we are fighting machines,” she said. “I think these people are not humans, that they are sentinels that maybe look like humans.”Owens also slammed Turning Point USA for giving a platform to Ben Shapiro. She said, “Ben Shapiro did not really like Charlie when he was alive, but he gave us a million dollars, so he is going to be at AmFest.” Shapiro later responded during his speech and urged people to call Owens out. Owens replied a day later, saying Charlie Kirk did not like him.Also Read: “I Want To Apologize”: Alex Jones Uses Sarcasm To Question Candace Owens Source Over Zodiac Killer Father Claim","Candace Owens is back on YouTube after a short break.

Twitch streamer Krimoe detained near the Houses of Parliament during live broadcast







A Twitch streamer has been arrested in London after a livestream showed a toy gun being waved near the Houses of Parliament. The incident happened in a busy public place, with famous landmarks clearly visible in the background. Police acted fast after the video appeared online and raised safety concerns.The streamer, known online as Krimoe, was broadcasting live on Twitch when officers arrived at the scene. He was later arrested on suspicion of having an imitation firearm in a public place. The arrest happened while the group was still live, making the moment spread quickly on social media.The Metropolitan Police confirmed that 11 men were arrested in total. All were later released on bail as officers continue their investigation. No one was hurt, but the case has sparked serious questions about public safety, livestream behavior, and responsibility online. The incident happened close to some of the most guarded locations in the UK, which is why police took it very seriously from the start.Krimoe, who has more than 48,000 followers, was part of a group livestreaming near the Houses of Parliament.The video showed the Big Ben and the Palace of Westminster clearly behind them.During the stream, a toy gun appeared on camera. It was pointed toward the lens and then passed around between people in the group. Moments later, police officers arrived and stopped the broadcast.The Metropolitan Police said in a statement that officers arrested 11 men “on suspicion of possession of an imitation firearm in a public place.” Police added that all suspects have been bailed while further checks are carried out.UK law treats imitation firearms seriously, especially in public places. Although it was a prop - it could still cause fear and panic especially when used in an environment such as Parliament that is very sensitive to the public. There were many comments made during the live-streamed incident stating how reckless the actions were. Others pointed out how livestreams can turn risky when creators try to shock viewers for attention.Twitch, which launched in 2011, allows users to broadcast live for long hours. While it started mainly for gaming, many streamers now use it for outdoor and lifestyle content. This case has again raised concerns about safety rules and how far creators should go during live broadcasts. Police have not confirmed when charging decisions will be made. For now, the investigation remains open.Also Read: Did Twitch Get Hacked?

Oman announces new fees for citizenship and nationality applications,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/oman-announces-new-fees-for-citizenship-and-nationality-applications/articleshow/126365443.cms,"Oman now charges OMR 600 for citizenship applications and OMR 200 for nationality withdrawal/Image: X





Applying for Omani citizenship will now come with a clearly defined price tag. In a move aimed at tightening and standardising nationality services, Oman has approved a new fee structure covering both citizenship applications and requests to relinquish nationality, according to details published in the Sultanate’s Official Gazette.Under the revised framework, the fee for submitting an application to obtain Omani citizenship has been set at OMR 600. This charge applies to foreign women married to Omani nationals, as well as widows or divorced spouses of Omanis. The same fee also covers applications submitted on behalf of the minor children of Omani women, ensuring a uniform cost across these family-based eligibility categories.In addition to citizenship applications, the updated regulations introduce an OMR 200 fee for requests related to the withdrawal or relinquishment of Omani nationality. This marks the formal introduction of charges for nationality renunciation, placing it alongside citizenship acquisition within a standardised administrative fee structure.The new fee schedule came into force on January 4, 2026, and applies across the Sultanate. Authorities have made clear that the decision is limited strictly to application and service fees. There are no changes to eligibility criteria, legal requirements, or the laws governing citizenship and nationality matters, and applicants must continue to meet the same conditions as before.Officials say the revised fees form part of broader efforts to streamline and standardise administrative procedures related to nationality services. By clearly outlining costs in the Official Gazette, the government aims to provide applicants with greater transparency, consistency, and certainty when navigating citizenship and nationality processes in Oman.","Oman now charges OMR 600 for citizenship applications and OMR 200 for nationality withdrawal.

Practical tips for fasting athletes in 2026



Shift Intense Training to After Sunset or Early Morning - Research shows that timing training around eating and drinking windows optimises performance and recovery during Ramadan. A systematic review in the Journal of Modern Social Sciences found that fasting athletes should adjust training schedules, emphasizing evening sessions after breaking the fast to allow fuel and hydration support before and after exercise. This approach helps maintain both endurance and strength while respecting the fast. Similarly, a World Health Organization–sourced review notes that athletic performance is least affected when tests or training occur after sunset or early in the day, rather than late afternoon during the fast. Prioritise Hydration Between Iftar and Suhoor - Hydration is a critical factor for athletes during extended fasting periods. Although fluid intake is restricted during daylight hours, experts recommend strategic rehydration between sunset (Iftar) and pre-dawn (Suhoor) to prevent dehydration and support performance. Sports nutrition discussions emphasise sipping water in smaller, frequent amounts and including electrolytes (sodium, potassium, magnesium) to replace sweat losses and maintain fluid balance. According to precision hydration specialists, proper hydration after breaking the fast not only supports training and performance but also aids muscle recovery, cardiovascular function and temperature regulation, all essential for athletes training hard. Plan Sleep Strategically and Use Naps When Needed - Sleep disruption is a common challenge during Ramadan because pre-dawn meals and late evening activities alter normal sleep patterns. Research shows that planned naps and adjusting sleep schedules can help offset sleep loss and support recovery, especially when night training sessions run late. Medical and nutrition sources warn that reduced or disrupted sleep can impair athletic performance, metabolic function and recovery. Prioritising sleep, including daytime rest when night training or social schedules cut into typical rest, is a key strategy for maintaining performance while fasting. Adjust Training Intensity According to Energy Levels - Scientific evidence indicates that athletes may need to modify training intensity during Ramadan rather than maintain pre-fasting volumes. A review published in PubMed found that maintaining performance depends on appropriate training intensity, timing and recovery and that athletes can sustain competitive levels when food, fluid and sleep are managed well. Sports dietitians and performance experts also recommend tailoring workouts to lighter sessions during fasting hours and higher-intensity sessions after Iftar to match fluctuating energy levels. This helps reduce the risk of fatigue, muscle breakdown and overtraining while fasting.

Bottom line: Fasting and performance can coexist

Are you a Muslim athlete training in Ramadan this February 2026 and wondering how will you compete while fasting from sunrise until sunset for 30 days? Whether it is world-class fighters, runners or team sport athletes, the art of performing while fasting is not only about their belief but strategy, timing and the science of doing things the right way.This balancing act has become an essential topic in sports science and new research is finally throwing light on the best ways to proceed when training hard on an empty stomach.One of the major points to be noticed about fasting athletes is related to the implications of fasting with respect to food and water intake. A systematic review published in the Journal of Modern Social Sciences in 2025 suggested that while Ramadan fasting alters hydration and energy availability, its impact on anaerobic and aerobic performance is generally limited if athletes manage training, sleep and nutrition properly. The study concluded, “effects on endurance and strength may be improved with proper training and nutrition management” and emphasizes maintaining consistent training during Ramadan as part of an effective strategy.This corresponds with sports nutrition studies, which have found that intermittent fasting such as the Ramadan diet, can enable the body to adapt in a manner where it utilises fat within its system with the help of spared carbohydrates.Based on research, fasting does not necessarily lead to reduced sports performance. Training sessions that take place after breaking the fast, that is, after iftar, show better results compared to training sessions conducted while fasting. This may be because water and nutrient consumption before and after training are essential for muscle and endurance recovery.Such an approach is supported by athletes and coaches alike. In Dubai, martial art competitors such as Bashayer Al Matrooshi and the national jiu-jitsu team of the UAE modify their schedules by training only after the iftar session, so that they refuel and hydrate before physically training.In many sports, the best athletes divide their trainings too with easy skill or activation exercises in the morning and strength or cardio trainings after sunset, when they can eat and drink normally.Contrary to common belief, several scientific investigations have found only modest performance drops or none at all when fasting athletes train smart. According to a 2007 study published in the Journal of Sports Science and Medicine , anaerobic performance and recovery were not significantly impaired by Ramadan fasting in elite athletes, provided hydration and rest were optimised.Another 2012 meta-analysis in Nutrients indicates that while fasting may reduce muscle glycogen and blood glucose, which can affect perceived exertion, anaerobic power and endurance can remain stable with proper timing of meals and training. Research on swimmers and young athletes also suggests that performance differences are often minimal or balanced by shifts in training intensity and recovery periods.Taken together, these findings show that performance loss is not inevitable but training adaptation, hydration planning and sleep timing are the real deciding factors.Fasting athletes are also susceptible to dehydration, in addition to food shortages. Since water is not taken for an entire day, it ends up becoming a big limiting factor, especially when training takes place in hotter environments. Two factors that have been widely observed to contribute to decreased performances in training in terms of balance, reaction time and energy levels include disturbed sleep and fluid restrictions.This explains why many pros pay much attention to post-sunset hydration strategies, as some training programs are designed around the time slots for iftar and suhoor (pre-dawn meals), which are essentially the slots for hydration replenishment before the onset of the new day's fast. Many teams now embrace the programs of hydration tracking, electrolyte replenishment and specific sleep timing to preserve performance while still observing the fast.Across different sports, Muslim athletes have found creative solutions where many schedule intense strength and conditioning sessions after sunset, when food and water are allowed. Fighters and combat athletes often train late at night to maximise recovery and energy availability. Some endurance athletes adjust by tapering mileage during fasting hours and increasing intensity only in the evening.Even elite performers, including NBA star Hakeem Olajuwon and professional footballers, have revealed publicly how Ramadan fasting didn't stop them from competing instead, in some cases, even sharpened their focus, discipline and mental resilience. Runners like Sifan Hassan and rowers like Mohamed Sbihi shift workouts to the non-fasting windows of the day. Top athletes conquer Ramadan fasting by prioritising recovery, nutrient timing and lower-intensity training sessions to maintain performance without health risk.Based on expert advice and scientific evidence, athletes can navigate Ramadan with minimal performance loss by:Fasting during Ramadan is not an antidote to athletic performance. However, there is an appropriate strategy that, if followed, will allow athletes to exert at an elite level, even when they are observing the fast. There are many discoveries being made in this field, which reveal the key fact that it is not the fast but the manner in which athletes respond to it, that impacts performance.",Ramadan does change the physiology but not always in negative ways.

No Hajj Visa Without It: Egypt Introduces Mandatory Health Rule for 2026 Pilgrims

Bottom line





Ahead of the 1447 AH/2026 Hajj season, the Egyptian government has announced that it will stop providing state-funded free pilgrimage slots. Instead, it will use electronic lottery systems and licensed paid pilgrimage packages. This is a significant change for millions of potential pilgrims and indicates reforms in Egypt’s public spending and Hajj logistics before the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia ’s upcoming Hajj season.Egypt’s Ministry of Social Solidarity and the National Foundation for Facilitating Hajj announced the results of the public electronic Hajj lottery for 2026 pilgrims, selecting approximately 12,000 applicants from across Egyptian governorates through a fully digital draw aimed at promoting transparency. Successful applicants must now pay for their pilgrimage arrangements through official channels.The confirmation of the lottery result was done through a press conference by Minister Maya Morsi. This highlights the fact that the lottery has currently become the main means for Egyptians, as opposed to a subsidized state sponsorship, for Egyptian Hajj visas.This is part of a bigger trend that has been underway for the past few years.During economic strains in 2022 and 2023, Egypt cancelled Hajj at state expense for the second consecutive year, opting not to use government resources to underwrite pilgrimages amid budgetary pressures.Separately, the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities opened Hajj registration via licensed tourism companies for the 2026 season, with applications accepted from mid-October and results published in early November. These packages are presented in economy, mid-range and premier options. They are fully paid pilgrim services, requiring applicants to cover costs ranging from accommodation to transport, managed through officially accredited tour operators.Government data showed that tourism Hajj packages this year were priced across categories to accommodate different budgets and that the ministry even reduced some prices slightly compared to the previous season to ease financial burdens. Here's what this means for Egyptian pilgrims -In addition to changes in government support and lottery systems for the Hajj 2026, Egyptian authorities have made it clear that Muslims going for Hajj must submit certain requirements regarding visas and health documents. The Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities has confirmed that pilgrims are required to present a “Health Fitness Certificate” before they can be given a Hajj visa. The health certificate is a medical document that verifies the pilgrims’ ability to carry out the Hajj rituals.All other official registration formalities have been conducted through the designated channels. The move is a part of the general procedural updates being undertaken to ensure that this is done in an orderly manner and in line with the rules established by the Saudi government, relating to visas as well as safety regulations among the crowds attendant at the annual pilgrimage. Notably, the process of visa application for tourism category Hajj pilgrims is put on hold until this certificate is submitted.Hajj is one of Islam’s five pillars and essential for Muslims who can afford it but rising costs and economic reforms have made traditional free or subsidised government sponsorships less viable. Egypt’s updated model meets the rising demand and Saudi Arabia ’s logistical changes for managing the annual pilgrimage. It prioritises transparency, fairness and controlled access through digital lotteries and regulated tourism channels.For potential pilgrims and their families, the message is clear. Hajj in 2026 will rely on paid, structured packages and lottery allocations instead of blanket government sponsorship.

Delcy Rodriguez was sworn in as Venezuela’s interim president on Monday, two days after US forces captured her predecessor, Nicolas Maduro, and his wife, Cilia Flores, to face trial in New York.Rodriguez took the oath in the National Assembly, telling lawmakers she did so ""in the name of all Venezuelans."" She has hinted she will cooperate with Washington. She had been serving as the vice president of the nation since 2018.Rodriguez was already effectively running the country since Maduro’s capture on Saturday. She initially said that Venezuela would “never again be anyone’s colony.”By Sunday evening, she dialled down her tone and issued a statement inviting the US government “to work jointly on an agenda of cooperation, aimed at shared development, within the framework of international law, and that strengthens lasting peaceful coexistence.”Addressing President Donald Trump directly, Rodriguez said: “President Donald Trump: our peoples and our region deserve peace and dialogue, not war. That has always been President Nicolás Maduro’s conviction and it is that of all Venezuela at this moment. This is the Venezuela I believe in and to which I have dedicated my life. My dream is for Venezuela to become a great power where all decent Venezuelans can come together.Venezuela has the right to peace, development, sovereignty and a future.”Rodriguez’s rise followed a series of extraordinary events. Maduro and Flores were captured by US forces and taken to New York, where they pleaded not guilty on drug and weapons charges in a federal court on Monday. The Supreme Court of Venezuela had sworn Rodriguez in as president on Saturday, and the country’s armed forces formally recognised her authority the next day, while still demanding the immediate release of Maduro and his wife at the same time.US President Donald Trump warned that Rodriguez could “pay a very big price” if she did not comply with his orders. He added that the US would now “run” Venezuela and hinted at a possible second strike if remaining members of Maduro’s administration refuse to cooperate with Washington. US secretary of state later clarified Trump's position that US will only create an oil blockade in Venezuela and does not want total hold and governance of the Latin American country.Furthermore, the situation sidelined Venezuela’s democratic opposition, which is led by Nobel Peace Prize winner María Corina Machado. Machado had dedicated her Peace Prize to Trump after winning it last year.A lot of Venezuelans have been celebrating Maduro’s downfall, but many remain cautious due to the alarming number of arrests of people who opposed the ousted leader.The American forces last week carried out Operation Absolute Resolve, in which they conducted coordinated strikes across key locations in Caracas, killing dozens.","Delcy Rodriguez was sworn in as Venezuela’s interim president on Monday.

UAE Visa Changes Hint at Bigger GCC Travel Plans in 2026

Humanitarian and special permits



Administration and documentation updates



Bottom line







The United Arab Emirates has swiftly moved into the New Year 2026 with several improvements to its visa and immigration systems where some modifications are indicative of the country’s growing vision to become the international destination for tourism, trade, innovation and living. From visa systems that are suited for the developing sectors to tighter sponsorship laws as well as easy visa issuance for tourists from target countries, many individuals are now wondering what the visa requirements are for the United Arab Emirates in 2026.Nearly a week into the New Year 2026 and the UAE seems to be in no mood to pause its pace. There are reports emerging about the UAE being on the verge of initiating two-year multiple-entry visas for work missions (Mission Visas), thereby ensuring flexibility for professionals.However, other regional initiatives, such as the Gulf Cooperation Council’s Unified Tourist Visa, which is still expected to roll out in 2026, may eventually enable visitors to move through all the GCC countries, including the UAE, using a single visa.At the forefront of the changes brought out in 2025 and now fully in effect in early 2026 are four brand-new visit visa categories designed to bring skilled specialists, creators, cultural participants and maritime tourists to the UAE. According to official updates, these include:This diversification goes well beyond traditional tourism, positioning the UAE as a destination not just for leisure travellers but for professionals in cutting-edge fields, creative talent and global event contributors.Another major shift that took effect in 2025 and continues into 2026 is the income-based sponsorship rule for residents who invite family and friends on visit visas. Instead of the prior, less-defined sponsorship requirements, UAE residents now need to meet specific monthly salary thresholds depending on the relationship:According to the authorities, this will go a long way towards making the system more transparent and will ensure that the sponsored visitors have adequate local support.In an attempt to build stronger relations with India, one of the largest markets for travel and business to the UAE, the country has expanded its visa-on-arrival services for Indians as of February 2025. Indians who possess valid visas or residence permits from countries such as Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea can now avail themselves of visa-on-arrival services at entry points to the UAE.This works in conjunction with the current eligibility for visas on arrival that had been granted to Indian nationals holding visas or residency in US, UK or other countries in the European Union , making it easier than ever for Indian nationals to enter the UAE on a short visit.The Golden Visa Residency Programme in the UAE, offering residency for 5 or 10 years, continued its steady growth in 2025 and into 2026 with further new occupations being added to attract the best worldwide talents. In addition to the classic investor groups, the visa has included individuals such as nurses with extensive seniority in their roles, educators and teachers, content creators and bountiful charity donors, particularly in Islamic endowment activities.These Golden Visa extensions continue to add to the UAE’s long-term plan of holding on to talent by providing security and flexibility to professionals and their families. The advantages extend to easier accessibility of property ownership, business setup and education opportunities.In 2025, the UAE introduced the Humanitarian Resident Permits, where the applicant can come from a country in the state of war, crisis or natural catastrophe and be allowed a stay in the UAE for a period not exceeding one year, renewable upon request, without the need for a sponsor. This is a major step in the human aspect in the visa systems and fits the UAE’s status as a world center for relief and stability.Beyond the new visa categories and sponsor requirements, there are other administrative reforms in the UAE that would ensure a smooth process as well as tightened security measures. Perhaps the most notable change, which applicants would need to be aware of is the compulsory submission of the passport's external cover page for all entry permit applications. It has been done in order to ensure better identity verification and greater accuracy when processing.Taken together, these reforms underline the UAE's forward-looking immigration strategy that balances economic growth, global talent attraction, tourism competitiveness and practical ease of movement for millions of visitors and residents every year. Whether you are an AI specialist looking to visit UAE on a visit visa, a family seeking to sponsor your relatives, a digital nomad desiring residency, or a traveller in search of a hassle-free entry from abroad, the United Arab Emirate's visa landscape stands wider, more diversified and more friendly towards opportunities than ever in 2026.","The United Arab Emirates has swiftly moved into the New Year 2026 with several improvements to its visa and immigration systems.

Planning, intent, and lack of remorse

“I don’t give a damn about how you judge me or what you think of me,” he said in one recording.

“I’m not going to apologize because during my lifetime no one sincerely apologized to me.”

“To say that I was extraordinarily satisfied, no, but also I don’t regret what I did,”

Views on responsibility, injury, and mental state

“Actually, I think that coming here, both times I did, was a f****g mistake. But to say that you all are extraordinarily bad, that would be neither bad nor good.”

“Honestly, my only regret is this thing in the eye,” he said, laughing. “But it was really hard, man.”

“I already know that you are going to say that I am mentally ill, or some shit like that,” he said. “That is all nonsense.”

“I am sane… I am sane, and… I’ve always been, more or less.”

“In my take on all of this,” he said, pausing repeatedly, “I think the world cannot be redeemed. To sum it all up, that is it.”





Federal assessment





Federal authorities say the man who killed two Brown University students and an MIT professor planned the attacks for at least six semesters and later recorded a series of videos in which he expressed no remorse, rejected apologies, and described the shootings as deliberate. The US Department of Justice released transcripts of the recordings on Tuesday, days after formally confirming the shooter’s death.The shooter, identified by law enforcement as Claudio Neves Valente, was a 48-year-old Portuguese national and former Brown University student. On 13 December, he opened fire inside an engineering building at Brown University, killing two students, Ella Cook and MukhammadAziz Umurzokov, and wounding nine others.Two days later, on 15 December, Valente fatally shot Nuno F.G. Loureiro at his home in Brookline, Massachusetts. Loureiro was an MIT professor and had attended school in Portugal decades earlier with Valente.On Thursday, 18 December 2025, the US Attorneys’ Offices, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives jointly announced Valente’s death. He was found dead inside a storage facility in Salem, New Hampshire.During a federal search of the storage unit, investigators recovered an electronic device containing several short videos Valente recorded after the shootings.In a statement released by the US Department of Justice, officials said the FBI recovered the device while executing a federal search warrant on 18 December. The videos were recorded in Portuguese and later translated into English.“In these videos, Neves Valente admitted that he had been planning the Brown University shooting for a long time,” the department said, adding that he did not provide a motive for targeting either the Brown students or the MIT professor.In the recordings, Valente said he had been planning the attack for more than six semesters and claimed he had numerous chances to carry it out earlier, but did not. In one video, he said he had “plenty of opportunities” but “always chickened out”.Across more than 11 minutes of footage, Valente spoke about the shootings, addressed how he was portrayed in the media, complained about a self-inflicted eye injury, and repeatedly rejected the idea that he owed anyone an apology.In another, he said:He framed his actions as intentional and final. He said his goal was to “leave on his own terms” and made clear he felt no regret for the killings themselves. In a DOJ statement, Valente was described as having “showed no remorse during the recordings”.the transcript reads.Valente also spoke at length about how he expected his actions to be interpreted. He dismissed claims that he was motivated by hatred of the United States, saying instead that the shootings were about opportunity rather than ideology.“When I say that I have no hatred toward America, I also have no love for it,” he said, before adding:He complained repeatedly about a serious eye injury he said he sustained during the attack on the MIT professor, describing it as the only thing he regretted.Valente rejected the suggestion that mental illness explained his actions.He insisted:Near the end of one recording, as the lights in the storage facility began to dim, Valente reflected on his worldview.The DOJ said Valente showed no remorse in the recordings and instead blamed others while complaining about his injuries.“He exposed his true nature when he blamed innocent, unarmed children for their deaths at his hand and grumbled about a self-inflicted injury,” the department said.Officials said the investigation into motive remains ongoing, but added that based on the evidence reviewed so far, authorities do not believe there is any continuing public safety threat linked to the shootings. Additional updates will be provided as more information is developed and after appropriate victim notifications.","US Department of Justice released transcripts of the recordings on Tuesday.

Trump mocks French President Emmanuel Macron





On Tuesday, December 6, 2026, US President Donald Trump gave a speech to the House GOP members at the Trump Kennedy Center in Washington, DC. From the impact of the Trump administration to the US's domination over the world and even his dancing skills, the 79-year-old leader of the nation addressed numerous topics and people in his 1-hour 25-minute speech.What should have been an address prepping the Republican leaders for the upcoming midterm elections, became a wide-ranging speech on everything he and his administration were able to achieve after the 'mess' they were handed post former President Joe Biden's term.Interestingly, Trump referenced three world leaders in his speech-Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi , former Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and French President Emmanuel Macron . He made some surprising and eye-raising comments about the world leaders that have left many shocked.While praising the 'brilliant' operation that the US military carried out during the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, he said that his decision should have been appreciated. ""They'd been after this guy for years and years and years. And you know he is a violent guy, he gets up there and he tries to imitate my dance a little bit. But he's killed millions of people,"" he said, justifying the attack and capture of the president and his wife on January 3, 2026.Next, he went on to praise the US military and its weapons. ""Nobody has our weapons, nobody has our quality of weapons. The problem is we don't produce them fast enough,"" he said.""We have the best weapons in the world, but it takes too long to get them. Including allies, when allies want to buy they have to wait four years for a plane, five years for a helicopter, we are not doing that anymore"" added Trump.He referenced how India had ordered 68 Apaches but had to wait for five years to receive them, which led to the country's prime minister, Narendra Modi reaching out to Trump. ""Prime Minister Modi came to see me, 'Sir, may I see you please? Yes!' I have a very good relationship with him. He's not that happy with me, cuz they are paying a lot of tariffs now, but they have now reduced it substantially, because of Russia,"" he explained. ""We’re getting rich from tariffs. Over $650 billion is set to flow into our country shortly"" he added.One of the most controversial segments of Trump's address was his mocking of French President Emmanuel Macron. While talking about the price of prescription drugs in America and comparing how the country paid more than any other country in the world, he referenced a conversation with Macron.Trump claimed he confronted Macron about the cost of prescription drugs, alleging that the US was paying '14 times more' than other countries for the same 'fat drug' Ozempic. He argued that America was subsidising lower prices across Europe and beyond. Thus, he contacted France and several other nations to increase their drug prices, a demand that initially faced pushback. ""Every country said the same thing,"" said the president.""No, no, no, we will not do this. Some were strong. Some were very nice, some were rude. But they all said one thing - no, we won't. And within, I'd say on average, 3.2 minutes, they were all saying, 'we would be honoured to quadruple our drug prices'.""He singled out Macron ""just as an example"" and shared how the threat of an increased tariff had the French president agreeing to the demand. ""Emmanuel, if on Monday, you haven't agreed to every single thing that we want, I'm putting a 25% tariff on everything coming out of France, including your wines, your champagnes and everything else,"" warned Trump.""Emmanuel said to me, 'Donald, uh, you have a deal, I would increase my prescription drug prices by 200% or whatever. I would love to do it would be such an honour,"" he claimed, Macron replied to him .While Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores face trial in New York, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and French President Emmanuel Macron are yet to respond to the shocking claims and comments which have made quite a buzz globally.","US President Donald Trump gave a speech to the House GOP members at the Trump Kennedy Center in Washington, DC.

‘ Rage baiting Indians,’ Nalin Haley boasts





A social media clash involving Vivek Ramaswamy and Nalin Haley, the son of former UN ambassador and Republican leader Nikki Haley , has ignited backlash online after Nalin openly bragged about provoking racist responses while taking aim at the Indian-American politician.The controversy erupted after Ramaswamy announced that he was stepping back from social media, a move that quickly became fodder for critics on the American right, including Haley’s son.Ramaswamy said the hostility he faced online had reached a breaking point, prompting him to quit social media platforms personally. In a Wall Street Journal opinion piece, the former DOGE leader wrote that he deleted X and Instagram from his phone on New Year’s Eve.“I’ll spend my newfound time listening to more voters in real-world Ohio, developing more policies to make our state affordable, and being more present with my family,” he wrote.Ramaswamy added that while his campaign team would continue using social media to distribute messages, he himself would stop scrolling through posts. He described social media as “a tempting alternative” to costly polling but warned that it often distorts reality.“The messages you’re most likely to see are the most negative and bombastic,” he wrote. Ramaswamy also said online commentary is largely shaped by bots and foreign actors, which can mislead politicians about what real voters think.The decision drew attention because it appeared to contradict Ramaswamy’s own earlier rhetoric. In a previous post that resurfaced widely, he had written: “If you’re scared of your comment section, you are not fit to lead.”Nalin Haley seized on that contradiction. In a post on X, he shared screenshots of Ramaswamy’s old comment alongside the Wall Street Journal op-ed announcing his withdrawal from social media.“If you’re wondering why the emoji is white now it’s cuz there’s a random intern on the other side of the screen Vifake Ramaslimey said just a few weeks ago that if you can’t handle mean words on a screen you can’t govern. For once he’s right and should take his own advice,” Nalin wrote.The post quickly went viral, triggering a flood of replies, some amused, others sharply critical, many of which focused on Nalin Haley’s language and personal attacks.As the comment section filled up, one user replied to Nalin Haley with a racist remark: “You will be deported back to India.” Rather than distancing himself from the comment, Nalin responded by embracing the controversy.“My all time favorite hobby is rage baiting Indians and Leftists into being racist. Never gets old,” he wrote. The remark drew fresh outrage, with critics accusing him of deliberately encouraging racist abuse for engagement, while supporters framed it as trolling political opponents.","Vivek Ramaswamy, an Indian-American politician, announced he was stepping back from social media.

Is this true?





Achieving the American dream has been the highlight of many lives. The ideal route involved getting a degree in the US, getting a job and building a career and life further ahead. For Indians, who are the largest recipients of H-1B visas this has been the golden route to a better life personally and professionally.But ever since the beginning of Trump's second term in 2025, the American scene has been surrounded by a do not enter tape for Indians. From increasing the H-1B fees to increasing the monitoring of the social media accounts of applicants, numerous policies and statements have made it clear that the American dream can be considered a distant one by the day.According to Indian-origin CNN journalist Fareed Zakaria, more and more Indian students are turning away from the US and the country only has itself to blame. Talking to American journalist Charlie Rose at his show 'A Charlie Rose Global Conversation', about the changing global education landscape, he said that the decline of Indian students heading to the US is not a temporary dip but an impactful structural shift.He shared the instance of a conversation with a friend who has invested in a business that helps students wanting to attend foreign universities get loans. ""He said my business is up 20% this year, but the American part of the business, Indians going to America, is down 50%.""When he asked his friend if this was a blip, he said no. This is because now, Indian students are searching for and discovering better alternatives. “People are discovering the rest of the world. They’re discovering that they could go to universities in Australia, in Canada, in Britain and they’re realising that it’s a third the price.

Germany reached 9% in 2025 from 4% in 2023 due to low tuition fees and post-study work opportunities. The UK has witnessed a whopping 143% surge capturing 39% of Indian students.

US President Donald Trump on Tuesday warned Republicans that failing to win the 2026 midterm elections would leave him vulnerable to impeachment by Democrats, as he sought to rally party lawmakers ahead of a high-stakes electoral cycle.“You gotta win the midterms ’cause, if we don’t win the midterms, it’s just gonna be – I mean, they’ll find a reason to impeach me,” Trump told House Republican lawmakers at a closed-door retreat in Washington. “I’ll get impeached.”Trump’s remarks came as Republicans prepare for November’s midterm elections, when all seats in the House of Representatives and a third of the Senate will be contested. With the GOP holding a razor-thin majority in the House, the outcome could determine the fate of Trump’s legislative agenda and his political standing in Washington.In a wide-ranging and often meandering speech that stretched close to 90 minutes, the president defended his actions during the Capitol riot five years ago, joked about courting transgender voters, and mocked a predecessor’s use of a wheelchair. While the event was intended to align the party’s executive and legislative wings, Trump devoted more time to airing grievances than outlining new policy initiatives.“We won every swing state. We won the popular vote by millions. We won everything,” Trump said, revisiting his 2024 election victory. “But they say that when you win the presidency, you lose the midterm.”Historical trends suggest the party in power often loses congressional seats during midterms, leaving Republicans with little margin for error. Trump acknowledged those risks but argued that his record should be enough to deliver victories in November.“You have so many good nuggets. You have to use them. If you can sell them we’re going to win,” he told lawmakers. “We’ve had the most successful first year of any president in history and it should be a positive.”The House GOP’s fragile majority has narrowed further following the death of California Rep. Doug LaMalfa and the resignation of former Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene. Trump noted the challenge facing Speaker Mike Johnson, saying, “You can’t be tough when you have a majority of three, and now, sadly, a little bit less than that.”Trump also referenced health care talks with insurers and briefly touched on Venezuela, tariffs and drug pricing, though he did not announce new legislative proposals. The meeting came amid renewed debate over Trump’s powers following the administration’s capture of Venezuela’s Nicolás Maduro, an operation largely backed by House Republicans.As the midterms loom, Trump made clear the stakes for his presidency, framing the election as a firewall against Democratic efforts to remove him from office.","President Donald Trump warned Republicans that failing to win the 2026 midterm elections would leave him vulnerable to impeachment by Democrats.

'End Of NATO': Denmark 'SURRENDERS' Greenland To U.S. As PM Admits Trump Serious About Takeover?





Hours after top Trump aide Stephen Miller audaciously asserted US “right” over Greenland, leaders of eight European nations on Tuesday stood up for Denmark and its self-governing constituent, bringing the 75-year old transatlantic alliance to a crossroad.""Greenland belongs to its people. It is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland,” leaders of France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, Denmark and the U.K said in a rare joint statement, pushing back at the US position.In stunning remarks on CNN on Tuesday, White House Deputy Chief of Staff and Trump immigration czar Stephen Miller questioned Denmark’s right to Greenland, while asserting that it is the formal position of the Trump administration that the long-recognized Danish realm should be part of the United States.“By what right does Denmark assert control over Greenland? What is the basis of their territorial claim? The United States is the power of Nato . For the US to secure the Arctic region, to protect and defend Nato and Nato interests, obviously Greenland should be part of the United States,” Miller said.The Trump aide repeatedly rebuffed the host’s question if he could take the military option off the table, scoffing at Greenland’s 30,000 population and asserting “We wouldn’t need military action…nobody is gonna fight the US militarily over the future of Greenland.”Indeed, the European statement, while pushing back at US claims, was not exactly muscular, preferring to remind Washington of mutual Nato obligations to defend the Arctic. It said that security in the Arctic must be achieved collectively with Nato allies, including the United States, by upholding the principles of the UN Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of border, adding ""These are universal principles, and we will not stop defending them. """"Nato has made clear that the Arctic region is a priority and European allies are stepping up. We and many other allies have increased our presence, activities and investments, to keep the Arctic safe and to deter adversaries. The Kingdom of Denmark—including Greenland—is part of Nato ,"" the statement said.Individually, European leaders have made stronger statements. Denmark’s Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has said any US invasion of Greenland would spell an end to Nato , and Germany’s foreign minister Johann Wadephul has warned that the United States will be at war with Europe if it grabs Greenland, asserting Nato members will have an obligation to defend Denmark if it was attacked by the US.“Greenland is part of the Kingdom of Denmark. And since Denmark is a member of Nato , Greenland will, in principle, also be subject to Nato defence,” he said.Greenland, a Danish colony from 1721 until 1953, is now an autonomous constituent country within the Kingdom of Denmark, locked in a relationship known as the Rigsfællesskab or ""Unity of the Realm.""While it is largely self-governing, Denmark controls Foreign Affair, Defense & National Security, and Monetary Policy. No administration before Trump’s had challenged this arrangement.Miller faced questions on the Trump White House position on Greenland after his wife, also a former White House staffer, posted on social media map of Greenland draped in US colors with the word “Soon” – soon after the US infiltration into Venezuela and its abduction of President Nicolas Maduro. The answers were a cold, chilling assertion of US “right” over Greenland that seemed to answer the question now raging across global capitals: Who’s next?","Leaders of eight European nations on Tuesday stood up for Denmark and its self- governing constituent, bringing the 75-year old transatlantic alliance to a crossroad.

Vivek Ramaswamy faces racist jab as Florida governor candidate James Fischer says ‘we wear shoes’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/vivek-ramaswamy-faces-racist-jab-as-florida-governor-candidate-james-fischer-says-we-wear-shoes/articleshow/126378334.cms,"Usha Vance J**t Slur Sparks Firestorm: Vivek Ramaswamy’s Outburst Splits MAGA | ‘You Have No Place…’





A Florida Republican gubernatorial candidate is facing backlash after a video surfaced appearing to mock Vivek Ramaswamy ’s Indian origin, drawing cheers from a crowd as he delivered what critics are calling a racially coded attack.The remarks were made by James Fishback, a 30-year-old hedge fund CEO and first-time Republican candidate for Florida governor, during a recent public event. In the clip circulating online, Fishback appears to ridicule Ramaswamy through a series of remarks that many have described as openly racist.The video begins with Fishback saying: “there is a fork in the road...I told that to Vivek and he said, ‘what’s a fork?’”The crowd immediately reacted with laughter and cheers, with Fishback visibly pleased as the joke landed.He then continued: “It’s weird we are all wearing shoes, it’s weird. We do that in oir country. We wear shoes. It would be weird if I showed uo not wearing shoes, right?”The clip ends shortly after, with applause from those in attendance.The exchange has fueled criticism online, with many pointing out that Ramaswamy’s Indian heritage appears to be the clear target of the remarks. One user pointed out, ""This guy is so fake.He used to support Vivek when he was trying to make a name for himself.""Another said, ""He’s running for mayor or standup comedian?""The rivalry between Fishback and Ramaswamy is not new, nor is Fishback’s hostility toward immigrants.Fishback has repeatedly positioned himself against immigration programs, particularly the H-1B visa system. He has previously stated that “there is no American Dream when H-1B visa holders are stealing jobs from Americans,” a comment he made after Ramaswamy posted about American exceptionalism, writing: “There’s no ‘Canadian Dream.’ There’s no ‘British Dream.’ There’s no ‘Chinese Dream.’ It’s called the American Dream for a reason. It’s what makes American exceptionalism possible.”Fishback has made opposition to the H-1B visa program a centerpiece of his campaign, declaring: “I’m running for Florida governor to end the H-1B scam so our workers can get great-paying jobs again.”Fishback, who is campaigning on a platform of “aggressive affordability” and “anti-H-1B” policies, reportedly drew more than 150 supporters to the event where the remarks were made.The situation is made more complex by Fishback’s past political ties. He previously served as an adviser to President Donald Trump’s government efficiency advisory commission, which Ramaswamy was co-chairing with Elon Musk. Fishback was also once described as a confidant of Ramaswamy.More recently, Fishback has found himself at the center of another major controversy, this time involving Walt Disney World.In late December 2025, Fishback attempted to host an unsanctioned political “meet-and-greet” at a Walt Disney World Resort. According to reports, more than 150 supporters gathered for the event. Disney security intervened, citing the company’s strict ban on unauthorized political activity on its private property.Fishback was escorted off the premises and later issued a formal lifetime trespass warning, barring him from all Disney-owned properties.The fallout escalated in early January 2026, when Fishback took to X (formerly Twitter), accusing Disney of political censorship and ideological manipulation.“Disney is no longer just a theme park; it is a political machine,” Fishback wrote in a viral post. “By banning a candidate for Governor from speaking to citizens, they are showing their true colors. They are terrified of leaders who will stop them from manipulating the youth with their ‘woke’ social engineering.”","James Fishback, a hedge fund CEO and first-time Republican candidate for Florida governor, appeared to mock Vivek Ramaswamy's Indian heritage.

'Been burned too many times': Trump loyalist Megyn Kelly refuses to cheer Trump and Fox News after Maduro capture,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/been-burned-too-many-times-trump-loyalist-megyn-kelly-refuses-to-cheer-trump-and-fox-news-after-maduro-capture/articleshow/126376474.cms,"Megyn Kelly’s Stunning Epstein Remarks Ignite Massive Backlash: “He Wasn’t a Pedophile”





Conservative commentator and longtime Donald Trump supporter Megyn Kelly said she would “exercise caution” over the Trump administration’s military operation in Venezuela, sharply criticizing her former employer Fox News for what she described as uncritical coverage following the capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro.Speaking on The Megyn Kelly Show on Monday, Kelly made clear she remains pro-Trump and pro-military, but warned against what she said would have been the expected tone had she still been working at Fox.“I would have known that I was supposed to cheerlead it, and I turned on Fox News yesterday, and I’m sorry, but it was like watching Russian propaganda,” Kelly said. “There was nothing skeptical. It was all rah-rah cheerleading, yes, let’s go.”She added that there “are serious reasons to just exercise a note of caution before we just get on the rah-rah train.”Kelly pointed to recent US military interventions, including Iraq and Libya, which she said ended in a “quagmire” and have failed “nine times out of ten.”“I have seen what happens when you cheerlead unabashedly US intervention in foreign countries, thinking it’s for our good and for the international good,” she said.She went on to criticize Fox News more broadly, saying she has “been embarrassed” in the past by being part of what she described as “green light territory” when it came to approving US military involvement overseas.“We’re not great at going into these foreign countries, decapitating them at the leadership level, and then saying, either we’re going to steer the country to a better place, or it’s going to steer itself,” Kelly said.Kelly also expressed deep discomfort with Trump floating the idea of “boots on the ground” in Venezuela, framing her concerns as a parent.“I speak for a lot of moms and dads, for that matter, when I say I’m staying in yellow territory until we know more, and I will not be joining the Fox News cheerleading brigade this time. I’ve been burned too many times,” she said.She also took aim at Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican who appeared alongside Trump on Air Force One on Sunday praising the operation.“The fact that Lindsey Graham is standing next to him is enough for me to know I don’t want it. I’m concerned,” Kelly said. “All of the neocons have been celebrating this whole thing like it’s, you know, Christmas in January, and that alone gives me pause. When Lindsey Graham is cheering, I’m not.”To underline her skepticism, Kelly invited Aaron Mate, an anti-war journalist, as her guest for the discussion.Later on Monday evening, Trump said the US would need to “nurse” Venezuela back to health, suggesting oil companies would play a central role and that taxpayers might ultimately help foot the bill.Trump said it would cost “a lot of money” to rebuild Venezuela’s energy infrastructure, but claimed the US could do it ahead of an 18-month timeline. He added, however, that American taxpayers could be on the hook, as oil companies may receive assistance to carry out the rebuilding.","Megyn Kelly said she would ‘exercise caution’ over the US military operation in Venezuela.

Craze, for love



A history of legal troubles







While the world might not be in love with FBI chief Kash Patel , he seems to have set an example for some young Republican members. A top aide to a Georgia Republican congressman is facing massive backlash after investigators alleged that he quietly handed out a fake internship to his girlfriend and got her on the federal payroll, despite her never having shown up for the job.Brandon Phillips, is a 39-year-old Chief of Staff to a Georgia representative. Mike Collins. Phillips has been accused of funding a paid congressional internship for a woman he was dating while she was simultaneously working elsewhere, as per a newly released report from the Office of Congressional Conduct (OCC).The findings, revealed in a 33-page referral were made public on Monday and have been forwarded to the House Ethics Committee for further review.As per the report, the OCC found ""substantial reason to believe"" that Phillips violated House rules by participating in the hiring and retention of Caroline Craze, 26, who was paid the dues of a district office intern despite never having worked at Collins' office.Craze received more than $10,000 in roughly four months for the alleged internship while she continued a full-time job elsewhere. As per the report, Craze's LinkedIn profile states her as working as an ""Internal Consultant"" at Cox Communications from January 2022 through January 2024.This overlaps with the period when the congressional office was paying her. Additionally, the OCC added that multiple witnesses had independently reported that Craze never worked in the office.“Ms. Craze never performed any duties in or for Rep. Collins’s District Office,” investigators wrote, despite being paid as an intern.Craze's Instagram profile obtained by the OCC includes pictures of her alongside not only Phillips but also Trump himself. Many on the internet have been questioning if the Phillips' decision was approved by Collins, too.Phillips on the contrary has been accused of failing to disclose the romantic relationship and improperly using his position to grant ""special favours or privileges"" to a person with whom he had a personal connection. House rules prohibit members and staff from engaging in biased employment decisions that benefit romantic partners.The report also mentioned Phillips' previous legal troubles. In 2022, he was arrested on a misdemeanour animal cruelty charge after he was accused of kicking a woman's dog. He was later released on a $1,200 bond.He also resigned as executive director of the Trump-Pence Georgia campaign in 2016 after reports of earlier criminal trespassing and battery charges resurfaced.As of now, Collin's office released a statement calling the complaint a politically motivated attack and describing it as “a sad attempt to derail one of Georgia’s most effective conservative legislators in Congress.”","Brandon Phillips, is a 39-year-old Chief of Staff to a Georgia representative.

Own goal? Pakistan admits political-criminal-terror nexus on its soil; report flags rising violence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/own-goal-pakistan-admits-political-criminal-terror-nexus-on-its-soil-report-flags-rising-violence/articleshow/126374963.cms,"



Pakistan’s Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry on Tuesday said that nearly 71% of terrorist incidents reported in 2025 originated from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP). He attributed this concentration to a “politically conducive environment and the flourishing political-criminal-terror-nexus which is flourishing there”.Data released by the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) reinforces the scale of the surge. KP recorded the sharpest rise in violence, with “fatalities rose from 1,620 in 2024 to 2,331 in 2025” — a year-on-year increase of more than 40%.The broader national picture is even starker. According to the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS), 2025 was the “deadliest” year in a decade, with 3,387 combat-related deaths. These included 2,115 terrorists, 664 security personnel, 580 civilians and 28 members of pro-government peace committees. PICSS said violence intensified in both “tempo and lethality”, pushing multiple security indicators to their highest levels in years.“Militant attacks climbed to their highest annual total since 2014, and the use of suicide bombings and small drones showed a clear upward trend,” the report said.Suicide attacks rose by 53%, while terrorist incidents overall increased to 1,063 — the highest since 2014.Security forces and civilians also bore rising costs. Security personnel fatalities rose 26% to their highest level since 2011, while civilian deaths increased by 24%, marking the worst toll in a decade. Injuries surged by 53% to 2,263, with sharp rises across all categories.The violence has been most acute in KP and Balochistan. In Bannu alone, Deputy Inspector General Sajjad Khan said 27 police personnel were killed in 134 attacks during 2025. Police carried out 168 intelligence-based operations, arresting 105 militants and killing 65, he said.Pakistan frequently accuses Afghanistan’s Taliban authorities of sheltering the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a militant group blamed for a sharp increase in attacks inside Pakistan since 2021. Afghan officials reject the allegations, insisting they do not permit their territory to be used for attacks against other countries.While the TTP operates independently from Afghanistan’s Taliban, the two groups maintain close ties.Relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan have deteriorated since October, when border clashes followed explosions in Kabul on Oct. 9 that Afghan officials attributed to Pakistan. Although Qatar later helped mediate a ceasefire, talks hosted by Turkey in November failed to produce a lasting agreement.","Nearly 71% of terrorist incidents reported in 2025 originated from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

ISLAMABAD: The polio vaccination campaign in Pakistan's merged districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa fell short of its target, leaving over 935,000 children under five unvaccinated, officials said, citing security challenges and population displacement as key hurdles, The Express Tribune reported.According to The Express Tribune, citing authorities, thousands of families from North and South Waziristan, Bajaur, and other merged districts have migrated to different parts of the country, complicating monitoring and vaccination efforts.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Khyber Pakhtunkhwa reported 19 polio cases in 2025, including four each in North Waziristan, Lakki Marwat, and Tank; three in Bannu; two in Torghar; and one each in Dera Ismail Khan and Lower Kohistan, as reported by The Express Tribune.Officials noted that staffing and operational support for WHO and Unicef programmes in the merged districts were reduced last year, while WHO funding cuts also affected campaign coverage, leaving children in these areas at heightened risk.In Sindh, more than 12,000 children under five were reportedly missed during the final polio drive of 2025 in Hyderabad and surrounding areas, according to The Express Tribune.Refusals were recorded mainly in Cantonment areas and municipal towns such as Hussainabad, Preetabad, Qasimabad, and Tando Jam, with absent households and parental refusals cited as primary reasons.Despite these gaps, the nationwide anti-polio campaign successfully vaccinated more than 44.6 million children across Pakistan, according to The Express Tribune.Punjab led with 22.9 million children vaccinated, followed by Sindh with 10.6 million, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with 7.15 million, and Balochistan with 2.58 million.Officials said contributions from other regions also added to the national tally.Authorities warned that without sustained vaccination efforts, particularly in displaced and high-risk populations, children in the merged districts remain vulnerable to polio, The Express Tribune reported.","Polio vaccination campaign in Pakistan's merged districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa fell short of its target.

China to deploy military in Balochistan?

Open Letter From Pakistan Backs India As Baloch Leader Signals Diplomatic Break With Islamabad





Baloch leader Mir Yar Baloch has raised a “serious threat” warning over deepening China–Pakistan ties, claiming that China could deploy its military forces in Pakistan’s Balochistan region in the coming months.In an open letter to external affairs minister S Jaishankar, posted on X on New Year’s Day, Mir Yar Baloch said Baloch representatives view the growing strategic partnership between Islamabad and Beijing as “dangerous.”He said Balochistan has “faced decades of repression under Pakistan’s control,” including what he described as “state-sponsored violence” and “human rights abuses.”""The people of Balochistan have endured Pakistan's state occupation, state-sponsored terrorism, and egregious human rights atrocities for the past seventy-nine years. The time has now arrived to eradicate this festering affliction at its roots, ensuring lasting peace and sovereignty for our nation, "" he wrote.In his letter to EAM Jaishankar, Mir Yar Baloch said that China and Pakistan are rapidly moving toward the final stages of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a major Belt and Road Initiative project led by Chinese President Xi Jinping that passes through Balochistan.“The Republic of Balochistan views the escalating strategic alliance between Pakistan and China as profoundly dangerous.We warn that China, in collaboration with Pakistan, has advanced the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) to its final phases,” he said.He warned that unless Baloch resistance and defence forces are strengthened, the region could soon see direct Chinese military involvement.“Should the capabilities of Balochistan's defense and freedom forces not be further bolstered and if they continue to be overlooked as per longstanding patterns, it is conceivable that China could deploy its military forces in Balochistan within a few months,” the letter stated.Mir Yar Baloch also said that any Chinese troop deployment without the approval of the local people could have serious consequences for the region.“The presence of Chinese boots on Balochistani soil without the will of the 60 million Baloch people would pose an unimaginable threat and challenge to the futures of both Bharat and Balochistan,” he wrote.China and Pakistan have repeatedly rejected claims that CPEC has a military angle, saying the project is only economic. India, however, has always opposed CPEC, pointing out that it passes through Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir and affects India’s sovereignty and security.Earlier this year in the Rajya Sabha, minister of state for external affairs Kirti Vardhan Singh repeated India’s stance. In a written reply, he said: “Government's position on CPEC is clear and consistent. Government has consistently protested to parties concerned over the inclusion of the so-called 'China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)', which passes through parts of the Indian Union Territories of Ladakh and Jammu & Kashmir under illegal occupation of Pakistan, as a flagship project of 'OBOR/BRI' and asked them to cease these activities. Any proposed participation of third countries or expansion of the so-called CPEC projects to third countries is unacceptable.”Mir Yar Baloch also praised India’s recent counterterror military actions, highlighting Operation Sindoor, which targeted key terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir after the Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 people.“We commend the bold and resolute actions undertaken by the Modi Government in the previous year through Operation Sindoor, particularly targeting terrorism hubs facilitated by Pakistan and directed against the Pakistani military in response to Pahalgam terror attack. These measures demonstrate exemplary courage and a steadfast commitment to regional security and justice,” he wrote.There has been no official response so far from the Union government, or from Chinese or Pakistani authorities, to Mir Yar Baloch’s claims.",Baloch leader Mir Yar Baloch has raised a “serious threat” warning over deepening China–Pakistan ties. He claims that China could deploy its military forces in Pakistan’s Balochistan region in the coming months.

"India, Pakistan exchange list of nuclear installations: All about the 1988 agreement; what purpose does it serve — explained",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/india-pakistan-exchange-list-of-nuclear-installations-all-about-the-1988-agreement-what-purpose-does-it-serve-explained/articleshow/126285395.cms,"What the agreement says



Why the annual exchange matters



Historical context



Limits of the agreement







NEW DELHI: India and Pakistan on Thursday exchanged, through diplomatic channels, the list of nuclear installations and facilities covered under the Agreement on the Prohibition of Attack against Nuclear Installations and Facilities, the ministry of external affairs said.The exchange took place simultaneously in New Delhi and Islamabad, in keeping with the provisions of the bilateral agreement that governs the protection of nuclear infrastructure in both countries.According to the MEA, the agreement requires India and Pakistan to inform each other of the nuclear installations and facilities covered under the pact on 1 January of every calendar year. Thursday’s exchange marked the 35th consecutive exchange of such lists, with the first taking place on 1 January 1992.The annual exchange has continued uninterrupted for over three decades, even during periods of heightened political and military tension between the two neighbours.The Agreement on the Prohibition of Attack against Nuclear Installations and Facilities was signed on 31 December 1988 and entered into force on 27 January 1991, following the exchange of instruments of ratification by both sides.Under the agreement, both India and Pakistan commit themselves to refrain from undertaking, encouraging or participating in any action aimed at causing destruction of, or damage to, nuclear installations or facilities in the other country.The scope of the agreement is broad. Nuclear installations and facilities covered under the pact include nuclear power plants, research reactors, fuel fabrication units, uranium enrichment facilities, isotope separation plants, reprocessing units and sites storing significant quantities of radioactive material, whether fresh or irradiated.The agreement also specifies that both countries must exchange information on the locations of these facilities, typically in the form of latitude and longitude coordinates, once every year.The annual exchange of lists is designed to reduce the risk of accidental, miscalculated or deliberate attacks on sensitive nuclear infrastructure during periods of conflict or crisis.By formally identifying protected sites, the agreement seeks to prevent scenarios in which conventional military operations could inadvertently escalate into a nuclear crisis. An attack on a nuclear installation, even with conventional weapons, could have catastrophic humanitarian, environmental and strategic consequences.Security analysts view the exchange as a confidence-building measure that helps maintain a minimum level of predictability between two nuclear-armed neighbours with a long history of conflict.Notably, the exchange has continued even during times of strained relations, including after major crises such as the Kargil conflict, the 2001–02 military standoff, the 2016 Uri attack and the 2019 Pulwama attack and Balakot air strikes.When the agreement was negotiated in the late 1980s, both India and Pakistan were moving steadily towards overt nuclear capability, though neither had yet conducted nuclear tests. Concerns over pre-emptive strikes on nuclear facilities, particularly in the context of regional instability, were central to the discussions.The agreement was one of the earliest formal nuclear confidence-building measures between the two countries and predated their 1998 nuclear tests, after which both openly declared themselves nuclear weapon states.Since entering into force in 1991, the agreement has remained intact despite the absence of progress on broader nuclear arms control or risk-reduction mechanisms in South Asia.While the pact prohibits attacks on nuclear installations and facilities, it does not restrict the development, deployment or use of nuclear weapons themselves. Nor does it include verification mechanisms beyond the annual exchange of lists.The agreement also does not cover missile bases, command and control centres or other strategic military assets linked to nuclear weapons.Even so, diplomats and experts argue that the continued observance of the agreement reflects a shared recognition of the dangers posed by attacks on nuclear infrastructure.More than three decades after it came into force, the agreement remains one of the few enduring pillars of nuclear risk reduction between India and Pakistan.In an environment marked by limited dialogue and recurring tensions, the uninterrupted annual exchange of nuclear installation lists serves as a reminder that both sides continue to acknowledge the need to prevent catastrophic escalation.For now, the routine exchange remains a rare example of sustained institutional cooperation between the two countries in the nuclear domain.","India and Pakistan exchange list of nuclear installations and facilities covered under the Agreement on the Prohibition of Attack against Nuclear Installations and Facilities.

""To Build Peace That Lasts"": China Claims Credit for India-Pakistan Conflict, Follows Trump





ISLAMABAD: Traders across Pakistan have threatened a nationwide shutdown on January 16 if the government does not withdraw its decision to make the installation of Point of Sale (POS) machines mandatory, warning that the move would further burden small businesses and open new avenues for harassment by tax officials, as reported by Dawn.According to Dawn, the warning came during a protest rally held in Islamabad, where traders attempted to march from Aabpara Chowk towards the Red Zone to demonstrate against the Federal Board of Revenue's (FBR) directive.However, heavy police deployment stopped the procession near the Serena Hotel, forcing demonstrators to hold a sit-in at the spot.The protest was organised by the All Pakistan Anjuman-i-Tajran in collaboration with the Traders Action Committee and drew participation from shopkeepers and market representatives from Islamabad and Rawalpindi.Leaders of various trader bodies addressed the gathering, accusing the government of targeting small businesses instead of addressing large-scale corruption.Addressing the crowd, Ajmal Baloch, president of the Traders Action Committee in Islamabad, described the compulsory installation of POS machines as a ""black law"" designed to intimidate traders rather than reform the tax system.He claimed that under the guise of documentation, traders would be exposed to greater harassment and bribery demands by tax officials.Citing an International Monetary Fund assessment, Baloch alleged that corruption in Pakistan amounts to nearly PKR 53 trillion annually, with the FBR accounting for a major share.He accused the department of selectively targeting small shopkeepers while ignoring large-scale corruption.He also alleged that many FBR officials own assets beyond their known sources of income and that their families enjoy foreign education and luxurious lifestyles.The protest leaders also highlighted alleged irregularities in customs operations, claiming that consignments of legally imported goods had been seized and partially returned, while the rest allegedly disappeared, as highlighted by Dawn.Warning of tougher action ahead, the traders announced that if the government attempted to forcibly install POS machines or seal shops, they would block a major arterial road in Islamabad and stage a sit-in at Zero Point on January 16.They further threatened a countrywide shutdown strike if their demands were ignored.The protesters appealed to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to intervene and protect traders from what they described as arbitrary and heavy-handed actions by tax authorities, as reported by Dawn.","Traders across Pakistan have threatened a nationwide shutdown on January 16 if the government does not withdraw its decision to make the installation of Point of Sale (POS) machines mandatory.

Pakistan army chief field marshal Asim Munir hosted his daughter’s wedding last week in the garrison city of Rawalpindi, where she was married to her first cousin, Abdul Rehman, according to Pakistani media reports.The ceremony was attended by senior political leaders and top military officials but was kept low-key due to security considerations, with no official photographs released.Among those present at the ceremony were Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari, prime minister Shehbaz Sharif, deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar, Punjab chief minister Maryam Nawaz, the chief of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), and several serving and retired senior army officers, including former army chiefs.Pakistani journalist Zahid Gishkori said around 400 guests attended the event, which was deliberately kept subdued.Gishkori, in a video posted on social media platform YouTube, confirmed the family connection between the bride and groom. “Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir's daughter Mahnoor married his brother's son, ex-army captain turned civil servant Abdul Rehman Qasim,” he said.The groom, Abdul Rehman, is Munir’s nephew. According to local media, he previously served in the Pakistan Army as a captain before joining the civil administration through a quota reserved for army officers.He currently serves as an assistant commissioner.Munir has four daughters, and last week's ceremony marked the wedding of his third daughter.The wedding coincided with the arrival of UAE President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan in Pakistan on the same day, prompting speculation on social media about a possible link between the two events. However, Ghiskori said that the UAE president did not attend the wedding.Pakistan’s security and foreign policy under Munir remains critical. A report by Greek City Times said that global patience with Pakistan’s trajectory toward “religious extremism” was wearing thin, alleging that the country had moved toward a more theocratic posture while failing to curb radical elements at home.Another report by Asian News Post criticised Islamabad’s military-led approach to regional diplomacy, particularly in relation to Afghanistan, stating that the strategy had failed to stabilise borders or improve Pakistan’s international standing.","Munir has four daughters, and last week's ceremony marked the wedding of his third daughter.

Pakistan's former spy chief Faiz Hameed challenged his conviction by a military court which had sentenced him to 14 years in jail, media reports said on Monday.Hameed, the former chief of the powerful Inter-Services Intelligence, was convicted on December 11 by a Field General Court Martial (FGCM) on four counts - engaging in political activities, violating the Official Secrets Act, misusing authority and government resources, and causing wrongful loss to individuals.Hameed's lawyer Mian Ali Ashfaq confirmed that the appeal was filed two days ago, The Express Tribune newspaper reported.A separate application has also been submitted to the Court of Appeal's registrar at General Headquarters Pakistan Army, seeking a copy of the written decision, it said.""The appeal has already been filed,"" Ashfaq said, without disclosing the specific grounds raised in the challenge.Hameed was allowed to appeal against the sentence within 40 days, as given under Section 133-B of the Pakistan Army Act.The appeal will be heard by a Court of Appeals headed by a major general or a senior officer nominated by the army chief, who may uphold, modify or set aside the sentence.Hameed is being held at Special Prison Rawalpindi and has not been shifted to Adiala Jail, the report said.His conviction stems from a 2017 complaint filed by a property developer, who alleged that Hameed, then serving as a major general in the ISI, along with two other officers, raided his residence and business premises, confiscated valuables, and forced him to pay Rs 40 million while also funding a private television channel.The matter resurfaced in 2023 when the Supreme Court directed the property developer to approach the defence ministry, which subsequently instituted a Court of Inquiry in April 2024 to probe the allegations, leading to Hameed's arrest on August 12 that year.The FGCM proceedings commenced on August 12, 2024, and continued for around 15 months before the verdict was announced.Hameed retired from military service in November 2022, became the first former ISI director general to be tried by a military court and convicted.

Pakistan FM Ishaq Dar Admits India Hit Nur Khan Air Base In Operation Sindoor Strikes





Pakistan has once again found itself on the defensive after a senior government official publicly acknowledged the impact of India’s precision strikes on a key military installation during the escalation in May, following Operation Sindoor The admission came from Pakistan’s foreign minister and deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, who, during a year-end press briefing on Saturday, confirmed that India had targeted the Nur Khan Air Base in Rawalpindi’s Chaklala area. Dar acknowledged that the strike caused damage to the military installation and injured personnel stationed there.Addressing reporters, Dar said India had launched multiple drone incursions into Pakistani territory within a short span, underlining the scale of the operation. “They (India) send drones towards Pakistan. In 36 hours, at least 80 drones were sent... We were able to intercept 79 drones out of 80, and only one drone damaged a military installation and personnel were also injured in the attack,” he claimed, according to news agency ANI.Also Read: 'Was advised to take shelter in bunker': Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari's big Op Sindoor admission - watch The foreign minister went on to describe the sequence of events following the strikes, saying that Pakistan’s civil and military leadership, led by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, held an emergency meeting on the night of May 9 to respond to the evolving situation.He added that India “made the mistake” of attacking the Nur Khan Air Base in the early hours of May 10, a remark that further acknowledged the strike and its impact.Dar’s comments amount to a rare public admission by a top Pakistani official of India’s military action on Pakistani air bases in May. The strikes came after Operation Sindoor, launched by the Indian Armed Forces to target nine terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir, in retaliation for the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam that killed 26 civilians.The Pakistan Air Force’s Nur Khan Air Base in Chaklala suffered significant damage during the Indian precision strikes. India had launched Operation Sindoor in the early hours of May 7 as a direct response to the Pahalgam attack.The escalation that followed saw increased cross-border shelling by Pakistan and retaliatory action by Indian forces. The situation later took an unexpected turn when Pakistan’s Director General of Military Operations contacted his Indian counterpart to propose a ceasefire, which India accepted. The outreach from the Pakistani side was later confirmed by Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri, who said both sides agreed to halt all military operations on land, at sea and in the air.Satellite imagery released by Maxar Technologies on May 13 showed significant damage to multiple Pakistani air bases, including Nur Khan Air Base. The images revealed damage at four installations: Nur Khan Air Base in Rawalpindi, PAF Base Mushaf in Sargodha, Bholari Air Base and PAF Base Shahbaz in Jacobabad. A comparison of satellite images taken on April 25 and May 10 showed clear damage to air base facilities, corroborating the strikes.This is not the first time a senior Pakistani leader has acknowledged the attack on Nur Khan Air Base. In May, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif admitted that Indian ballistic missiles had hit the base and other locations, breaking from Pakistan’s usual practice of denying Indian military action.Addressing a ceremony at the Pakistan Monument on May 16, Sharif said, “At around 2:30 am on May 10, General Syed Asim Munir called me on a secure line and informed me that India's ballistic missiles had hit Nur Khan Airbase and other areas.

(With ANI inputs)





NEW DELHI: Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari admitted that he was urged to take shelter in a bunker for his safety during the four-day confrontation with India in May, a remark that underscored India’s prowess to strike deep into mainland Pakistan.According to Zardari, the advice came from his military secretary, though he claimed he refused to take shelter.“I had actually told him (secretary) four days earlier that a war was going to happen. But he came to me and said, ‘Sir, let’s go to the bunkers.’ I replied, ‘If martyrdom is to come, it will come here. Leaders don’t die in bunkers; they die on the battlefield. They don’t die sitting in bunkers,’” Zardari said on Saturday at a rally marking the death anniversary of his wife and former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, who was assassinated in 2007.He added that every worker of his Pakistan Peoples Party was ready to sacrifice his life for the nation.Zardari also responded to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “roti khao, varna meri goli toh hai hi” (eat your food peacefully, or else my bullet is waiting for you) warning to Pakistan, saying that it would be Pakistan that would fire the bullets.He further remarked that India may have an economy 10 times larger than Pakistan’s, but questioned where it would find the “courage” to fight a war.Indian armed forces launched Operation Sindoor on the intervening night of May 6–7 in retaliation for the Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 civilians.

Trump Puts Asim Munir On Gaza Test: Can Pak Army Chief Appease U.S & Avoid Backlash At Home?

Former Imran Khan aide Shahzad Akbar attacked in UK





Pakistan on Friday summoned Britain’s deputy high commissioner Matt Cannell after a video circulated online showing a woman at a rally in the UK referring to a possible attack on Pakistan Army chief General Asim Munir The ministry of foreign affairs called in Cannell to lodge a formal protest and demanded an investigation after the woman, speaking at a rally in Bradford in northern England, mentioned the possibility of the army chief being killed in a car bombing. Pakistani officials said the remarks went beyond political expression and raised serious security concerns.The rally was held in support of Pakistan’s jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan and was attended by his supporters living in the UK. Khan was removed from office through a no-confidence vote in April 2022 and has been in prison for nearly two years.The Bradford protest came days after a special court of Pakistan’s Federal Investigation Agency sentenced Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, to 17 years in prison each in the Toshakhana-II corruption case.According to Dawn, the court also imposed a fine of Pakistani Rs 16.4 million on each of them, with additional jail time possible in case of non-payment. The case relates to the alleged illegal retention and sale of state gifts received while Khan was in office.The video from the Bradford rally was initially shared on X by the UK chapter of Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party before being deleted.Explaining the decision, PTI UK said in a post on X: “We have removed a video from the recent Bradford protest featuring a citizen’s metaphorical remarks regarding General Asim Munir. Although we do not believe the individual incited violence, the post was deleted in an abundance of caution to prevent potential misunderstanding and legal safeguarding of the individual and her rights.”Pakistan’s deputy interior minister Talal Chaudhry said the remarks crossed a red line. Speaking to Geo Television, he said: “While Imran Khan’s party has been inciting supporters against the military, the car bomb threat at the Bradford rally crossed all limits. It does not fall into the category of freedom of speech.”He urged the UK government to investigate the incident and take legal action if laws were violated.Responding to Pakistan’s concerns, the UK High Commission in Islamabad said in a brief statement: “Where a foreign Government believes a crime has been committed, they should provide all relevant material to their UK police liaison. Any material that appears to break UK law will be reviewed by the police and may lead to a criminal investigation.”The diplomatic move comes amid escalating tensions between Khan’s supporters and Pakistan’s powerful military. Earlier this month, army spokesperson Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry described Khan as “mentally ill” during a press conference, after posts on Khan’s official X account referred to General Munir as “mentally unstable,” according to the Associated Press.Separately, tensions escalated further after PTI said Shahzad Akbar, a former adviser to Imran Khan was attacked in the United Kingdom on Thursday.In a post on X, Akbar said he was assaulted outside his home in Cambridge by an unidentified man.“Yesterday at approximately 8:08 a.m., I was attacked at my home by an unknown assailant dressed in what appeared to be construction or waste-collection attire,” Akbar wrote. “The individual asked, ‘Are you Shahzad Akbar?’ and immediately began assaulting me. The incident occurred in the presence of my family.”Akbar said he sustained facial injuries, including bruising and a fractured nose, and was taken to a local hospital before being discharged.“The police have taken cognizance of the matter and have assured me and my family that they are actively investigating this targeted attack and will work to apprehend both the perpetrator and those behind it,” he said.He added that he could not share further details at this stage, including CCTV footage, on the advice of authorities.“I have full faith in the rule of law and in British law enforcement to carry out their duties,” Akbar said, urging the UK government to ensure the safety of dissidents.In a follow-up statement, Akbar said the attack would not silence him.“I want to make one thing absolutely clear: If my views, political comments, or even my ‘face’ is not liked by anyone, such cowardly acts will only strengthen my resolve rather than silence me,” he wrote. “Violence will not intimidate me or deter me from speaking out.”The Pakistan government has previously submitted extradition documents to British authorities seeking Akbar’s return. Akbar, a PTI member, has been accused by the state of anti-government activities.",Pakistan summons Britain’s deputy high commissioner Matt Cannell.

They reveal repeated discussions on Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal, links to Iran’s nuclear programme, and the role of the AQ Khan proliferation network.In a key Oval Office meeting in 2005, Putin raised concerns over evidence suggesting Pakistani-origin uranium had been found in Iranian centrifuges, questioning Western tolerance of Islamabad despite its proliferation record.“But it's not clear what the labs (Iran) have, where they are. Cooperation with Pakistan still exists,” Putin said during the meeting.Bush responded by referring to his discussions with then Pakistani president Pervez Musharraf, saying, “I talked to Musharraf about that. I told him we're worried about transfers to Iran and North Korea. They put AQ Khan in jail, and some of his buddies under house arrest. We want to know what they said.I keep reminding Musharraf of that. Either he's getting nothing, or he's not being forthcoming.”Putin reiterated his concerns, stating, “As far as I understand, they found uranium of Pakistani origin in the centrifuges.”Bush acknowledged the issue, saying, “Yes, the stuff the Iranians forgot to tell the IAEA about. That's a violation.”“It was of Pakistani origin. That makes me nervous,” Putin said, to which Bush replied, “It makes us nervous, too.”Also read: 'I want Pak': Rajnath recalls Vajpayee's unmatched wit; all about iconic moment The documents also highlight Putin’s blunt assessment of Pakistan during an earlier meeting with Bush in Slovenia in 2001. “I am concerned about Pakistan. It is just a junta with nuclear weapons. It is no democracy, yet the West makes no criticism of it. Should talk about it,” Putin said.According to the transcripts, both leaders expressed anxiety about Pakistan’s internal political instability, its military-led governance under Musharraf, and the risk that sensitive nuclear technology could fall into the wrong hands. The discussions repeatedly returned to the AQ Khan network, which was later confirmed to have supplied nuclear technology to Iran, North Korea, and Libya.The declassified records underscore longstanding international concerns about Pakistan’s nuclear command and control systems and the broader implications of its proliferation activities.The revelations come amid renewed scrutiny of Pakistan’s nuclear conduct. Last month, India criticised Islamabad following remarks by US President Donald Trump alleging that Pakistan had been secretly testing nuclear weapons.Reacting to Trump’s comments, Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said such actions were consistent with Pakistan’s history. “Clandestine and illegal nuclear activities are in keeping with Pakistan's history, which is centred around decades of smuggling, export control violations, secret partnerships, AQ Khan network and further proliferation,” he said.“India has always drawn the attention of the international community to these aspects of Pakistan's record,” Jaiswal added."," transcripts of meetings and phone calls between former US president George W Bush and Russian president Vladimir Putin released by US National Security Archive.

Pak PM Sharif's Party Leader Threatens India, Warns Missiles Will Respond If Bangladesh Is Targeted





In a sharp attack on Pakistan’s security establishment, Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman accused the military leadership of employing a “double standard” regarding cross-border military operations. Speaking at a recent gathering in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the influential Deobandi cleric questioned the logical consistency of Pakistan’s defence policy, specifically contrasting Islamabad’s recent strikes in Afghanistan with its diplomatic outrage over Indian activities within Pakistani borders.He asked Pakistan’s military brass why India’s actions inside Pakistan should be condemned when Islamabad justifies strikes in Afghanistan by calling them attacks on its enemies. Rehman argued that if Pakistan claimed a sovereign right to launch pre-emptive or retaliatory strikes against perceived enemies on Afghan soil, it weakened its moral and legal standing when protesting similar actions by India. “We sent militants to Afghanistan for 20 years. .. from giving them Kalashnikovs to Cruise missiles... we empowered them in every way. When you bombed Kabul, it was as if someone had bombed your Islamabad.This is the limit, isn’t it? If you had bombed the remote areas, you might have been able to tolerate it. So, you took some action there as well...”“...If you say, and I have questions, that we have attacked the enemy’s headquarters and you call this a legitimate statement, India says to you that it has attacked Bahawalpur, it has attacked Muridke, it has attacked the headquarters of those who are operating against us in Kashmir. Why are you objecting to this? And if you object to this, and if you have the same claims against Afghanistan, how will you justify it..?”Rehman’s criticism comes at a time when Pakistan’s Field Marshal Asim Munir continues his anti-India rhetoric and claims that Pakistan received “divine help” during the military confrontation with India in May which was felt during the days of intense fighting that followed Indian strikes on terror targets.Rehman’s comments touch upon a sensitive nerve in geopolitics, specifically referring to locations like Bahawalpur and Muridke — areas long identified as hubs for terrorist groups like JeM and LeT — which were decimated during Operation Sindoor. By asking, “Why different rules for India?” Rehman highlighted the strategic hypocrisy: justification of “counterterrorism strikes” in the west, while demanding absolute territorial sanctity in the east.",Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman accused the military leadership of employing a “double standard” regarding cross-border military operations.

'90% Own Tech...Took Out Rafale, S-400': Asim Munir Makes Absurd Claims On India-Pak Conflict





JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman on Tuesday said that Pakistan should not oppose attacks by India if the country itself was attacking Afghanistan.Speaking to journalists in Rehman said, “If you justify attacking Afghanistan by claiming you are targeting your enemy there, then why do you object when India targets its enemy in Bahawalpur and Murid (inside Pakistan)?”He further warned that continued tensions between the two neighbours would only destabilise the region and said dialogue and political engagement were the only lasting solutions.The JUI-F chief also slammed Pakistan's army saying political power belonged to the people and not the armed forces, reported local news paper The Express Tribune. ""Political strength is not the right of defence institutions; it belongs to the people and politicians,"" Rehman said.Rehman further said national progress depended on constitutional supremacy, not the dominance of one institution over others. The senior cleric-politician also opposed sending Pakistani troops to Palestine.On Afghanistan, Fazlur Rehman noted that no Afghan government, from the time of King Zahir Shah to Ashraf Ghani, had been friendly towards Pakistan, and asked whether this pointed to failures in Pakistan’s own policy. He said blaming Afghanistan alone would not help and called for honest internal debate.",JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman said Pakistan should not oppose attacks by India if the country itself was attacking Afghanistan.

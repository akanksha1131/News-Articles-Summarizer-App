Series of attack on Tesla vehicles and dealerships

US President Donald Trump claimed that recent arson attacks on Tesla vehicles across the country could be acts of ""domestic political terrorism"" driven by 'left-wing operatives'. His remarks came during a segment on The Ingraham Angle Tuesday night.The conversation with Fox News host Laura Ingraham touched on the incident of five Tesla set on fire in Las Vegas. When pressed by Ingraham on whether he considers these attacks an act of domestic terrorism, Trump responded, ""I think so,"" adding that he believes the perpetrators may be linked to politically motivated groups on the left.""The good thing is they have a lot of cameras in those places, and they've caught some already having to do with that,"" Trump said, adding, ""I think that you will find out that they're paid by people that are very highly political on the left.""Trump also praised Tesla CEO Elon Musk , describing him as a ""patriot"" who became an ally during the 2024 presidential campaign. ""I hardly knew Elon until the election,"" Trump admitted. ""He turned out that he liked me better than he liked these radical lunatics... because he's an intelligent person."" According to Trump, Musk believed that the country's future was at risk if he did not win re-election.The recent in Las Vegas is just one in a series of violent attacks on Tesla. In another incident recently, a man attempting to torch a Tesla charging station in protest against US President Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk ended up setting himself on fire, authorities said. In another incident of alleged arson, fire erupted in two Tesla Cybertrucks at a dealership in Kansas City, Missouri on Monday evening.The recent attack in Las Vegas is just one in a series of violent incidents targeting Tesla. According to the Kansas City Police Department, a fire erupted in two Tesla Cybertrucks at a dealership in Kansas City, Missouri, on Monday evening. Last week, ""more than a dozen"" shots were fired at a Tesla dealership in Tigard, Oregon. In Colorado, a Tesla dealership was firebombed, with vandals spray-painting ""Nazi cars"" on the building. On March 11, three Teslas were vandalized in Dedham, Massachusetts, with spray-painted messages and tire damage reported.These incidents follow a pattern of escalating violence against the electric vehicle company, which has faced vandalism and protests since Tesla CEO Elon Musk took on a government role.","Series of attack on Tesla vehicles and dealerships could be acts of 'domestic political terrorism' US President Donald Trump said he believes the perpetrators may be linked to politically motivated groups on the left.

Trump revokes Biden kids’ security details,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-revokes-biden-kids-security-details/articleshow/119185245.cms,"Hunter and Ashley Biden

President Donald Trump said Monday evening he was ending Secret Service protection for former President Joe Biden’s son Hunter and daughter Ashley.Not only did Trump declare in a social media post that Hunter Biden — who has been a Trump target for years — would lose his protection “effective immediately,” he mentioned his whereabouts: “He is currently vacationing in, of all places, South Africa, where the Human Rights of people has been strenuously questioned.” The post merged two of Trump’s recent fixations: He has talked constantly about his predecessor and the Biden family since returning to office. And he has talked a lot lately about what he sees as the plight of white farmers in post-apartheid South Africa.Trump’s post came after New York Post (a publication he reads closely) published an opinion article about Biden’s South African vacation and his security detail. On Monday afternoon, a reporter asked Trump about the topic as he was touring the Kennedy Center. “I just heard about it for the first time,” Trump said. He added that it was “really interesting” and that he plan ned to “take a look at it.” A few hours later, he made his post.Anthony Guglielmi, a Secret Service spokesperson, said: “We are aware of the president’s decision to terminate protection for Hunter and Ashley Biden. The Secret Service will comply and is actively working with the protective details and the White House to ensure compliance as soon as possible.” A representative for the Biden family declined to comment. This latest setback for Hunter Biden came days after he told a judge that he had “suffered a significant downturn in his income and has significant debt in the millions of dollars range” and therefore could not continue with a lawsuit against a former Trump aide.",President Donald Trump said Monday evening he was ending Secret Service protection for former President Joe Biden’s son Hunter and daughter Ashley.

French politician questions US on Statue of Liberty; White House hits back,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/french-politician-questions-us-on-statue-of-liberty-white-house-hits-back/articleshow/119186373.cms,"Statue of Liberty

Lost on briefing cross-talk:

TOI correspondent from Washington: The smackdown was swift, but the blowback was brutal. The Trump White House on Monday reaped a whirlwind in history after sowing the wind with a snarky putdown to a French politician’s suggestion that the US should return the Statue of Liberty , a gift from France, because Americans have chosen tyranny over freedom.“If it weren’t for the US, the French would be speaking German right now. So, they should be very grateful to our great country,” White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said, alluding to US help during World War II when Hitler’s Germany marched into France.The putdown came in response to remarks by Raphael Glucksmann, a left-wing politician in France, who said “It (Statue of Liberty) was our gift to you. But apparently you despise her. So she will be happy here with us.” Leavitt also referred to Glucksmann as an “unnamed, low-level politician”, manifesting the disdain with which the Trump White House speaks of many foreign politicians not aligned with its MAGA worldview.Blowback to the comments from the White House spokesperson came not from the French, but from many Ameri cans better versed in history.“Such a shocking, insulting statement about an ally from anyone, let alone a senior White House official. I hope our @PressSec knows that it’s only because of the French that we have an independent United States of America,” Michael McFaul, a former US ambassador to Russia, said. Many others said it was German defeat at the hands of Russia on the eastern front that saved France.Indeed, French help in freeing America from British colonial rule is consecrated right in front of the White House at Lafayette Park, with a statue of Major General Marquis Gilbert de Lafayette, who fought alongside George Washington at the Battle of Yorktown.Washington DC itself is a French-designed city, laid out by Pierre Charles L’Enfant — buried in Arlington National Cemetery —on the lines of Paris and Versailles.French support for American freedom came in preference to India, where Haidar Ali and Tipu Sultan beseeched Louis XVI, and later Napolean, for help against the British, only to see them choose to fund the Americans. Ironically, Lord Cornwallis who surrendered at Yorktown in 1781 later went to India and played a key role in defeating Tipu Sultan in the Battle of Srirangapatna.A little spark of that history is preserved in the American national anthem, the star spangled banner, in which the line “rockets red glare” is a reference to Congreve rockets used during the bombardment of Fort McHenry in Baltimore Harbor.The artillery was inspired by iron-cased rockets used by Tipu’s forces during the Anglo-Mysore war.","A French politician suggested that the US should return the Statue of Liberty because Americans have chosen tyranny over freedom.

1. Driving the news: The extent of the document release

2. Why it matters: A window into Cold War dynamics

3. Between the lines:

Lee Harvey Oswald

’s movements

4. Zoom In: Oswald’s contact with Soviet officials

5. What they're saying: KGB insight into Oswald

6. Behind the scenes:

Operation Mongoose

revealed

7. The big picture: Trump’s commitment to transparency

8. What’s still missing: Documents not yet public

9. No immediate game-changers

10. What next: Continued scrutiny and speculation

More than six decades after the assassination of President John F Kennedy stunned America, the Trump government has released a significant trove of previously classified documents. The release, mandated by President Donald Trump soon after he took office, encompasses over 1,100 files, totaling approximately 31,000 pages. These documents are part of a long-standing effort by historians, researchers, and conspiracy theorists to fully understand the circumstances surrounding JFK's death on November 22, 1963.While many experts caution that these files may not dramatically alter existing historical narratives, the continued fascination surrounding the assassination—and the persistent belief among many Americans that the full truth has yet to surface—means these newly revealed details are certain to attract intense scrutiny and debate.More than 1,100 previously classified files have now been released, amounting to over 31,000 pages. Originally, Trump had estimated 80,000 pages would be disclosed, illustrating the magnitude of information related to this historical event. The documents include CIA memos , FBI reports, and diplomatic cables.Historians emphasize that even though no revolutionary changes to the central narrative have been revealed yet, these documents provide valuable context about the intense atmosphere of suspicion and geopolitical tension during the Cold War era. They reveal intelligence operations and illustrate how the assassination impacted US-Soviet relations during a particularly volatile time.Significant portions of the newly released material detail the movements of assassin Lee Harvey Oswald. CIA memos outline Oswald’s travels to the Soviet and Cuban embassies in Mexico City weeks before the assassination, suggesting he sought visas to relocate to Cuba or return to the Soviet Union.One critical CIA memo from after the assassination highlights an intercepted phone call indicating Oswald spoke with a KGB officer at the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City in September 1963. The document doesn't confirm cooperation or direction but indicates close KGB monitoring of Oswald.An intriguing document from 1991 recounts CIA contacts with a KGB official. It stated clearly that Oswald was never controlled by the KGB, emphasizing his erratic behavior and describing him as difficult, if not impossible, for any intelligence agency to manage.“Confident that Oswald was at no time an agent controlled by the KGB,” the memo reads, describing the Soviet viewpoint.The documents shed further light on ""Operation Mongoose,"" a previously secret CIA-led sabotage operation against Fidel Castro's Cuban regime authorized by JFK himself. These insights underscore the extent to which covert Cold War conflicts were deeply entwined with JFK’s presidency.The document release fulfills a transparency promise Donald Trump made soon after taking office. Despite initial delays, Trump positioned himself as a president dedicated to revealing long-held government secrets. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard declared, ""President Trump is ushering in a new era of maximum transparency.""Despite the expansive release, researchers estimate roughly 3,000 files related to JFK’s assassination remain partially or wholly undisclosed. Moreover, the FBI recently discovered another batch of approximately 2,400 assassination-related records, which they are preparing to release through the National Archives. About 500 documents, including sensitive personal tax returns, were exempted from disclosure.Historians like Fredrik Logevall emphasize that while the documents enhance historical understanding, dramatic revelations altering the assassination narrative are unlikely.Larry Sabato, author and director at the University of Virginia Center for Politics, noted the task ahead for historians and researchers is substantial.“We have a lot of work to do for a long time to come, and people just have to accept that,” Sabato said.","More than 1,100 previously classified files have now been released, amounting to over 31,000 pages.

""We are committed to enhancing our ability to deliver clean air, water, and land for all Americans,"" Vaseliou added.

Just hours after President Donald Trump called for the impeachment of a judge who sought to pause the removal of more than 200 migrants to El Salvador, chief justice John G Roberts Jr issued a rare public statement. “For more than two centuries,” the chief justice said, “it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision. The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose.”President Trump, in a post on Truth Social about the judge, said, “This Radical Left Lunatic of a Judge, a troublemaker and agitator who was sadly appointed by Barack Hussein Obama, was not elected President He didn’t WIN the popular VOTE (by a lot!), he didn’t WIN ALL SEVEN SWING STATES, he didn’t WIN 2,750 to 525 Counties, HE DIDN’T WIN ANYTHING!

"Cities across the US are facing challenges with federal assistance, says Hoboken Mayor Ravi Bhalla",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/cities-across-the-us-are-facing-challenges-with-federal-assistance-says-hoboken-mayor-ravi-bhalla/articleshow/119184971.cms,"Times of India’s

Ravi Bhalla, the Indian American Mayor of Hoboken , New Jersey, is not disheartened by his defeat in the Democratic primary race for the US House from New Jersey’s eighth district, last year. Bhalla, who became mayor in 2017 and was re-elected in 2021; has now entered the race for the Democratic nomination for New Jersey state assembly in the Hudson County-based 32nd legislative district. From the lessons learnt during his Congressional campaign to the strong support from the Indian American community towards his state assembly campaign, Bhalla spoke to theIshani Duttagupta on various topics. Edited excerpts from the interviewQ: You have announced that you are running for the New Jersey state assembly. How is your campaign going?A: The campaign is going great so far and we have a lot of energy and excitement about the prospects for the future. I have had the privilege of serving as Hoboken mayor for eight years now and so it has given me an understanding of what the priorities are of residents both in Hoboken and the entire district. It is important to bring concerns of the district to the state level in Trenton [New Jersey state capital] to see how we can coordinate with local officials to move the district forward. We are aggressively trying to get the message out to the voters and we are confident that our campaign will be embraced by the electorate.Q: Are you finding a lot of support from the Indian American community for your campaign?A: Yes, absolutely. There are many Indian Americans who reside in Jersey City and there’s a little India section with a very robust section of the population who are of Indian origin. There’s also a large and growing number of Indian Americans in Hoboken and they have embraced not just my campaign as mayor but now my campaign for state assembly. When I knock on doors, I see many Indian Americans and they welcome me. There is a lot of excitement and the campaign is warmly embraced by the Indian American community. I think this is because of the historic under-representation of Indian Americans not just in New Jersey but nationwide. So this is part of the larger national campaign to make sure that South Asian and Indian voices are elevated at higher levels of state, federal, and local government. For donors, too, there’s a feeling that not just in the districts but nationwide they want to see faces from our community in positions of influence.Q: What have been your biggest achievements as Mayor of Hoboken?A: As mayor, one of the first things that I did was sign off an executive order declaring Hoboken as a fair and welcoming community. That’s because we want to make sure people from different communities and diverse backgrounds come to Hoboken and feel that they have equal rights under the law and are welcome and respected here. We appreciate and elevate diversity in Hoboken and anybody, no matter where they come from, is valued and welcomed when they are here. We have also made great strides in the area of economic turnaround in Hoboken. When I first became mayor, the bond rating was junk status. But because we have been able to stabilise taxes and reduce or eliminate structural deficits we have now been rated by S&P at AA+ which reflects fiscal responsibility and making sure that we have a budget that is sound and properly balanced. We are also taking strong strides in the area of climate action. Since large weather events like Superstorm Sandy , we have created innovative projects to make Hoboken resilient for generations to come. Lastly, I’d say that Hoboken has become a national model in the area of street safety and reducing the number of traffic violations and accident collisions. We seek to eliminate all traffic deaths and fatalities by 2030. We have taken many steps to make sure that our urban landscape is amenable to vulnerable communities whether it is children or seniors, who need to use our streets and roads safely, and also people who engage in micro-mobility whether it is walking or biking.Q: You are the first Sikh mayor in NJ – has that been a challenge?A: Being the first Sikh mayor hasn’t been challenging for me from a governmental perspective in terms of actually moving the city forward and making it grow in the right direction. From the electoral standpoint, there was a lot of scepticism about my viability as a candidate because there is a very small minority of South Asians and an even smaller minority of Sikhs who live in Hoboken. So that raised the question of whether I was an ideal candidate for an elected office in a city that does not have a sizeable population of Sikhs and Indians. But I tried to press upon people that though I was the son of immigrants from India, I was born and raised in the US. I’m just like everyone else – we care about the same things; we want our children to be educated and we want our streets to be clean and communities safe. These are issues that we all care about as residents of Hoboken and these transcend background. To the credit of Hoboken, they looked at which candidate could move Hoboken forward in a positive direction – that outweighed identity politics.Q: As a Democrat in public life, do you see challenges ahead because of the Republican president?A: There are not necessarily challenges for Democrats in public office, but mayors and cities across the US are facing challenges concerning federal assistance and appropriations that have been granted to them. This administration is trying to freeze a lot of the funding that is flowing from Washington DC to the ground level to cities and states across the country that make an actual difference to people’s lives from healthcare access to reproductive rights and supporting scientific and academic research. We are making sure that we have an inclusive city where rights are respected by all. These are all under attack by Washington DC right now and people at the frontlines are local units, mayors, governors and legislators who can push back and say that this is not America and this does not represent our values. In some cases, some actions are contrary to law and so there is a movement to push back in the hope that constitutional protections are in place for cities and for individuals which will be upheld by the courts. There have been many legal challenges that have gone in favour of people who challenged the Trump administration and Hoboken has joined in one of these. We seek to make sure that we protect the rights of all Hoboken residents and that’s a nationwide trend. We are disappointed but we are also energised to make sure that we do our duty as Americans to push back and stand up to the Trump administration.Q: You were a civil rights attorney; was the transition to politics a natural one for you?A: In some ways it was a natural progression. As a mayor you need to appreciate the way law intersects with policy and with government and having knowledge of the way the judicial system works is a benefit for me. I feel it will be a huge benefit if I have the privilege of serving in the state legislature considering that the intersection of law and government is something that is very real.Q: What were the takeaways from your Congressional campaign?A: It was a wonderful experience and I got to meet so many residents across the Congressional district and listen to their concerns. It was an opportunity to listen to real people on the ground and it’s been a huge benefit for me and given me understanding about the electorate and what is on their minds. I have got an understanding about the issues in the district; rising rents and cost of living issues about which people talked to me. These are our fundamental rights which are under assault. The Congressional campaign was about the federal and state governments stepping up to the Trump administration which is now trying to pull back some of those rights. We need to make sure that we step up as leaders and protect people who are vulnerable in the district. Running for Congress for me was a great opportunity to understand those issues in the district.Q: Does your district celebrate Indian culture in a big way?A: Yes, there is a large and growing Gujarati population in Jersey City and every Navratri celebration is attended by thousands of people. The Holi festival in Hoboken was just started by my administration as mayor; as also the Diwali festival. Every August, we also have the Indian flag at Hoboken city hall in honour of Indian Independence day. More than just symbols, these are means to celebrate and elevate diversity in our community and let the Indian American community know that the Hoboken government celebrates and supports their identity. I hope there will be many opportunities as legislator in the 32nd District to make sure that the Indian community has the resources to be activated to spread cultural education, especially at grade school level.","Ravi Bhalla, the Indian American Mayor of Hoboken, New Jersey, is not disheartened by his defeat in the Democratic primary race for the US House from New Jersey’s eighth district.

Trump's order

A federal judge on Tuesday blocked US President Donald Trump 's executive order prohibiting transgender individuals from serving in the military, adding to a series of judicial challenges to his broad policy initiatives.In Washington DC, US District Judge Ana Reyes determined that Trump's directive to exclude transgender troops likely infringes upon their constitutional protections.She postponed implementing her decision until Friday to allow the administration to lodge an appeal. ""The court knows that this opinion will lead to heated public debate and appeals. In a healthy democracy, both are positive outcomes,"" Reyes wrote. ""We should all agree, however, that every person who has answered the call to serve deserves our gratitude and respect.""The preliminary injunction was granted following a request from lawyers representing six active-duty transgender service members and two prospective military recruits. The plaintiffs include distinguished service members: an Army Reserves platoon leader from Pennsylvania, a Bronze Star recipient Army major who served in Afghanistan, and a Navy Sailor of the Year award winner.Their legal representatives from the National Center for Lesbian Rights and GLAD Law emphasise these troops simply wish to continue their military service. The attorneys highlighted the policy's sudden reversal, arguing it undermines unit cohesion and military strength whilst disparaging honourable transgender service members.On January 27, Trump issued an executive order stating that transgender service members' sexual identity ""conflicts with a soldier's commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one's personal life"" and undermines military preparedness.Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth responded with a policy that generally excludes individuals with gender dysphoria from military service. This condition, characterised by distress arising from a mismatch between assigned and identified gender, is associated with depression and suicidal ideation.The plaintiffs' legal representatives assert that Trump's order violates Fifth Amendment equal protection rights for transgender individuals. Government solicitors maintain that military officials should retain broad authority to manage service member assignments and deployments without judicial oversight.Whilst transgender service members constitute less than 1% of active-duty personnel, thousands currently serve in the military.A 2016 Defence Department policy permitted open transgender military service. During Trump's presidency, he implemented a transgender service ban, which the Supreme Court allowed. President Joe Biden later reversed this ban upon taking office.Hegseth's February 26 policy declares that service members or applicants showing symptoms of, having a history of, or currently diagnosed with gender dysphoria are unsuitable for military service due to strict mental and physical requirements.This comes after federal judges in Seattle and Baltimore have separately suspended Trump's executive order halting federal support for gender-affirming care for transgender youth under 19. Recently, a judge prevented prison officials from moving three transgender women to men's facilities and ending their hormone therapy access.Trump has also issued orders regarding gender-related school curriculum and aimed to prevent transgender athletes from participating in girls' and women's sports.","A federal judge on Tuesday blocked US President Donald Trump's executive order prohibiting transgender individuals from serving in the military. In Washington DC, US District Judge Ana Reyes determined that Trump's directive to exclude transgender troops likely infringes upon their constitutional protections. She postponed implementing her decision until Friday to allow the administration to lodge an appeal.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119183836,imgsize-800018,width-400,resizemode-4/119183836.jpg"

While the raid successfully led to the detention of more than two dozen individuals, including foreign nationals, it quickly descended into disorder as locals swarmed the premises to seize valuables, as reported by the local Pakistani newspaper The Nation. Laptops, monitors, keyboards, and other electronic equipment intended for investigative purposes were instead carried away by opportunistic looters.Videos circulating on social media captured scenes of individuals, young and old, forcing their way into the building and openly making off with electronic devices. A large crowd gathered outside, and despite the presence of law enforcement, the looting continued unabated. Eyewitnesses reported that FIA officials struggled to control the situation, allowing the ransacking to proceed unchecked. Amid the chaos, some foreigners linked to the scamming operation reportedly escaped.Sources within the FIA, quoted by The Nation, indicated that the agency had been aware of the call center's illegal activities for some time but delayed action while awaiting approval from senior authorities. The center was allegedly involved in defrauding individuals across multiple countries, using Pakistani employees to execute scams and extort money.The individuals detained during the raid were transferred to the FIA office for further questioning. However, the agency has remained tight-lipped about the broader investigation, declining to provide additional details despite repeated inquiries.

A key operative of LeT, he was involved in planning and executing multiple attacks in Jammu and Kashmir.

He was also known as Faisal Nadeem .

Qatal had strong ties with Hafiz Saeed , the mastermind behind the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks.

His terror activities date back to 2002-03 when he infiltrated India and operated in the Poonch-Rajouri region.

He founded terror outfits like People’s Anti-Fascist Force (PAFF) and The Resistant Force (TRF) to hide LeT and Jaish-e-Mohammed’s (JeM) activities.

PAFF, one of his proxy groups, was designated a terrorist organization by ministry of home affairs on January 7, 2023.

Abu Qatal , a top Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) operative and one of the most wanted terrorists, was gunned down by unidentified assailants in Pakistan's Jhelum Sindh on Saturday night.He was a high-priority target for Indian security agencies, including the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and the Indian Army, for his involvement in the 2023 Rajouri attack and the 2024 Reasi bus attack , along with other deadly assaults in Jammu and Kashmir.","Abu Qatal, a top Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) operative, was gunned down by unidentified assailants in Pakistan's Jhelum Sindh on Saturday night.

At least two Pakistsoldiers and nine terrorists were killed after the Pak security forces raided two hideouts used by an armed group in the restive northwest, triggering gun battles, Al Jazeera reported.The raids were conducted on Saturday in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Mohmand and Dera Ismail Khan districts, which border Afghanistan.According to local police, the fighters belonged to Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), also known as the Pakistani Taliban.Notably, TTP -- banned in Pakistan -- is a separate group but an ally of the Afghan Taliban, who reseized power in neighbouring Afghanistan in August 2021 as the United States and other NATO troops were in the final stages of a withdrawal from the country after 20 years of war.Many TTP leaders and fighters have found sanctuaries and have even been living openly in Afghanistan since the Taliban takeover, which also emboldened the Pakistani Taliban, according to Al Jazeera.In a separate incident on Saturday, fighters ambushed security forces in northwestern Pakistan's Kurram district, bordering Afghanistan, the report said, citing local police. Authorities have yet to confirm any casualties in that attack.Pakistan's military is engaged in an ongoing operation in Kurram, an area that has witnessed years of violence between Sunni and Shia Muslim communities, as reported by Al Jazeera. Hundreds of people have been killed in fighting between armed groups, exacerbating tensions in the region.Kurram has remained isolated since last November, after authorities blocked key roads following sectarian violence. The closure has led to severe shortages of medicine and food, deepening a humanitarian crisis.In another incident, a bomb exploded outside a mosque in the northwestern city of Peshawar, killing a religious leader, local police said on Saturday. It was unclear who was behind the attack, and an investigation was being conducted.","Pakistani security forces raid two hideouts used by an armed group, triggering gun battles.

According to the directive, such activities - whether on stage or in classrooms - must no longer take place in educational institutions.

Back-to-back attacks on mosques

Balochistan train attack

A powerful blast at a seminary-cum-mosque in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province’s Peshawar district killed a senior cleric and injured three others on Saturday, marking another attack on religious institutions in the region within 24 hours.Mufti Munir Shakir , the founder of the outlawed militant group Lashkar-i-Islam , succumbed to his injuries at Lady Reading Hospital (LRH), hospital authorities confirmed. The explosion took place in Urmur Bala village, prompting a swift response from police, the Counter-Terrorism department, and bomb disposal teams, who are now investigating the scene.Mohammad Asim, an LRH spokesman, confirmed the cleric's passing, stating, “Mufti Shakir was brought to LRH in a critical condition and succumbed to his injuries.”Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister’s Advisor on Health, Ihtesham Ali, expressed his condolences, calling Shakir’s death a ""martyrdom"" and mourning the loss.Mufti Munir Shakir was a controversial figure in Khyber tribal region, known for founding Lashkar-i-Islam in 2004. However, his extremist views and conflicts with another militant leader, Haji Namdar, led to his expulsion from Bara Qambarkhel within six months.After continued internal strife, a tribal jirga forced both Shakir and Pir Saifur Rehman out of Bara in early 2005. The group later came under the leadership of Mangal Bagh, a former bus driver turned militant, who was elevated to amir in May 2005.Pakistani security forces launched their first military operation against Lashkar-i-Islam in mid-2005, demolishing the house of Haji Rabat and destroying an FM radio station the group had set up inside a mosque.The blast comes less than a day after another explosion at Maulana Abdul Aziz Mosque in South Waziristan on Friday. The attack, carried out using an improvised explosive device (IED), left Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI) district chief Maulana Abdullah Nadeem and several others injured.The province has witnessed repeated attacks on mosques, particularly during Friday prayers when large gatherings make them vulnerable.Last month, a suicide blast at Darul Uloom Haqqania seminary killed six people, including JUI-S leader Maulana Hamidul Haq Haqqani, and injured 15 others.The Pakistan Army on Friday said that 18 of the 26 hostages killed in the Balochistan Liberation Army's recent ambush on a train were army and paramilitary soldiers.Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General, Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, stated during a press conference with Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfaraz Bugti that militants executed all 26 hostages before the military operation began.“The 26 hostages include 18 army and paramilitary soldiers, three other government officials and five civilians,” he confirmed.","Mufti Munir Shakir, the founder of the outlawed militant group Lashkar-i-Islam, succumbed to his injuries at Lady Reading Hospital (LRH), hospital authorities confirmed.

Smooth landing, rough questions

Passengers aboard Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) flight PK-306 got an unexpected surprise when their aircraft landed in Lahore—with one of its rear wheels missing. Despite what sounds like a scene from an action movie, the landing was smooth, and no injuries were reported.The big mystery now: Did the wheel vanish midair or was it never there to begin with?PIA officials have launched an investigation to determine whether the aircraft took off from Karachi already missing a wheel or if it fell off during takeoff. Some wheel fragments were reportedly found at Karachi airport, raising eyebrows about the plane’s condition before departure.""It appears that one of the rear wheels was in shabby condition when the aircraft took off,"" an official admitted, reported PTI.PIA’s damage control mode kicked in quickly.

The Dalai Lama’s succession has long been a point of contention between Tibetans and China, but his latest statement has escalated the dispute. In his newly published book,, the 89-year-old Tibetan spiritual leader has explicitly stated for the first time that his successor will be born in the ""free world""—outside of China. This defies Beijing’s longstanding claim that it has the sole right to choose the next Dalai Lama.For China, controlling the Dalai Lama’s succession is about more than religion—it’s about political authority and maintaining control over Tibet. The Dalai Lama, who fled to India in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule, has long been regarded as a “separatist” by Beijing. With his 90th birthday approaching in July, the question of who will succeed him has become urgent, as it could determine the future of Tibetan Buddhism and Tibet’s political movement. Below, we break down the key issues surrounding this controversy.Also read: ‘Will be born in free world’: Dalai Lama declares successor will be born outside China; Beijing counters China considers the Dalai Lama to be a symbol of Tibetan resistance and fears that an independent successor could fuel separatist sentiments. By controlling the reincarnation process, Beijing hopes to install a Dalai Lama loyal to the Chinese government, ensuring tighter control over Tibet. The current Dalai Lama, however, has made it clear that any successor appointed by China will not be respected by Tibetans:According to Tibetan Buddhist tradition, the Dalai Lama is reincarnated, and his successor is identified by senior monks through visions, signs, and tests. Historically, this process has been free from political interference. However, China insists that it has the final say, citing historical conventions:– Mao Ning, Chinese foreign ministry spokespersonIn, the Dalai Lama explains that his successor must be free from Chinese control to continue his spiritual and humanitarian mission:This move is intended to prevent China from appointing a successor who would serve its political interests rather than uphold the spiritual and cultural values of Tibetan Buddhism.Beijing has dismissed the Dalai Lama’s remarks, insisting that it alone has the authority to choose his successor. The Chinese Foreign Ministry called him:They also reiterated that the reincarnation must follow government regulations:The controversy over the Panchen Lama—a senior figure in Tibetan Buddhism—illustrates China’s approach to religious succession. In 1995, the Dalai Lama identified a six-year-old boy, Gedhun Choekyi Nyima, as the 11th Panchen Lama. Shortly after, the Chinese government abducted the child and appointed its own Panchen Lama, Gyaltsen Norbu, who is seen by many Tibetans as illegitimate.The original Panchen Lama has not been seen since, with China claiming that he is now living a ""normal life."" This fuels fears that Beijing will follow the same strategy with the next Dalai Lama.If China installs a Dalai Lama of its choosing, Tibetans and the global Buddhist community are unlikely to accept him. This could lead to two rival Dalai Lamas—one recognized by Tibetans in exile and another by China. The Dalai Lama himself has warned:A divided leadership could deepen the Tibetan resistance against Chinese rule and further strain China’s relations with the international community.The dispute over the Dalai Lama’s succession has global implications, especially for China’s relations with India and the US.Beijing has condemned such foreign involvement as an attempt to destabilize China.In, the Dalai Lama expresses concern over Tibet’s fate under Chinese rule but remains hopeful:He also reaffirmed that the struggle for Tibetan freedom will continue beyond his lifetime:(With inputs from agencies)","Dalai Lama says his successor will be born in the ""free world""—outside of China.

They paint an entire nation with a broad and unjustified brush. Bangladesh, like many countries around the world, has faced challenges with extremism, but it has continuously worked in partnership with the international community, including the US, to address these issues through law enforcement, social reforms, and other counterterrorism efforts.

United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres on Friday called for urgent international support for Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh, warning that cuts in humanitarian aid could lead to a disaster.Speaking at a joint press briefing in Dhaka during his four-day visit to Bangladesh, Guterres urged the international community to provide financial and political assistance to both the refugees and their host communities.""I strongly appeal to the international community to allow us to avoid any tragedy,"" he said. He also praised Bangladesh's “extraordinary generosity” in sheltering more than one million Rohingya refugees and described it as a testament to the country’s humanitarian spirit.Guterres visited Cox’s Bazar, where most of the Rohingya refugees live in overcrowded camps, and described the impact of global aid cuts on vulnerable populations as “a crime”, reported AP.He criticised the United States and European countries for slashing humanitarian assistance while increasing defence budgets.According to AP, the UN’s World Food Programme (WFP) has warned that without urgent funding, food rations for Rohingya refugees could be cut by half next month. A recent WFP letter stated that $81 million is needed to sustain operations until the end of the year, including $15 million for April alone.Guterres assured that the UN will continue efforts to secure funding and stressed that Rohingya refugees must not be forgotten. ""We cannot accept that the international community forgets about the Rohingya,"" he said.Bangladesh’s Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus met with Guterres and urged the UN to mobilise humanitarian aid and support the repatriation of Rohingya refugees to Myanmar, which he described as the ultimate solution.""We are trying to raise attention to the plight of the Rohingya people. The world should know how they are suffering. There is a feeling of frustration,"" Yunus was quoted as saying by AP.Guterres emphasised that Myanmar remains the homeland of the Rohingya and called on all parties in Myanmar to ensure their safe and voluntary return. ""My message to all parties in Myanmar is clear: exercise maximum restraint, prioritise the protection of civilians, and create conditions for the Rohingya to return home,"" he said, as per PTI.Bangladesh has consistently maintained that repatriation is the only long-term solution, but efforts have stalled due to ongoing political instability in Myanmar. The Buddhist-majority nation has been accused of genocide against the Rohingya in an international court.As per ANI, Guterres reaffirmed the UN’s commitment to advocating for Rohingya rights and ensuring that they receive humanitarian assistance.He also attended a photo exhibition in Dhaka, interacted with youth and civil society members, and held a joint press conference with foreign adviser Touhid Hossain.His visit will conclude with an iftar hosted by the chief adviser before he departs from Dhaka on March 16.","United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres on Friday called for urgent international support for Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh.

DHAKA: Amid growing protests against attacks on women and rising incidents of rape, Bangladesh police on Thursday imposed restrictions on all kinds of meetings, rallies, gatherings, processions and showdowns in key locations for an indefinite period.Areas under restriction include the official residence of chief adviser Mohammad Yunus, the secretariat and nearby locations. Bangladesh has witnessed intensified demonstrations in recent days, with protesters demanding resignation of the home adviser for failure to ensure safety and security of citizens, especially women and girls.Meanwhile, the Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council issued a press note stating that 92 incidents of violence targeting minorities and indigenous peoples occurred in the first two months of this year.

Indian radiographer suspended in UK for not knowing how to X-ray hand or foot,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/unable-to-perform-x-ray-indian-radiographer-suspended-in-uk/articleshow/119130183.cms,"Representative AI image: Indian radiographer suspended in UK

LONDON: A radiographer from Kerala has been suspended from practising in Britain for six months after a panel found she was not able to do basic procedures like X-raying a hand or foot that a radiographer “straight out of training would be able to do”, and that she was putting the health of UK patients at risk.Smitha Johny, an Indian national who trained in India, had declared her first language as English on her application to be registered with the health and care professionals council (HCPC) in 2021. By law, radiographers must be registered with it to work in the UK. She had also declared English as her first language on her application to work as a radiographer at the private hospital, North Downs Hospital, in Surrey, where she started working in Jan 2023. She also claimed to have 23 years of experience.Johny had to resign and is back in India.However, the health and care professions tribunal service found that she struggled to communicate with patients and colleagues in English, was unable to answer basic questions about the radiography process, could not identify basic anatomy, did not follow required guidelines, was unable to set a up an X-ray machine, failed a mandatory life support course, and misrepresented her experience. Theyfound her performance reflected incompetence rather than “misconduct”, saying she was “naïve” and “did not understand the expectations in the UK, which may be different from those where she was working in a remote part of India”.Her line manager, Fernando Pinto, was so concerned about her performance that he presented himself as a patient coming for a hip X-ray. She pointed the machine towards his knee, not his hip, which was a radiation breach causing unnecessary exposure, which could cause cancer. Pinto told the panel she showed “no knowledge about the X-ray machine”, did not know how to position it and did not know what any of the buttons were for. She also did not ask him enough about his personal details to check she was X-raying the correct patient.She was unable to recognise the scaphoid bone in the wrist, nor could she identify a fracture in the neck from an X-ray, and did not know what a femur bone was. She also failed the life support course because she could not understand anything the instructor was saying.At her three months review in April 2023, when confronted with her poor performance, she said she was “more like a manager in her previous role” and had worked on the hospital reception desk in India checking in patients. She also said she had worked with CT scanners and not X-rays. She was then told she would be put on authorised leave that could leave to termination.On April 24, 2023 she resigned.On April 26, 2023 her manager referred her to the HCPC raising concerns about her command of English and lack of professional knowledge. The hospital also contacted the home office, which gave her 60 days to leave the UK.In an earlier stage of the proceedings, Johny had said the X-ray machines in India were “entirely different to those at the hospital” and alleged there was “racism in the workplace”.Johny required a Malayalam interpreter to attend her virtual video hearing, which was held in March this year. She was in India at the time and only attended on the first day, saying she was ill and her “family condition is very bad”. She did not attend after that and did not make any submissions.","Smitha Johny, an Indian national who trained in India, had declared her first language as English on her application to be registered with the health and care professionals council (HCPC) By law, radiographers must be registered to work in the UK.

A scholar under threat

A technicality with huge consequences

The shock and fallout

A systemic issue?

A decorated historian, an Oxford alumna, and a researcher dedicated to unearthing India's colonial past—Manikarnika Dutta never imagined she would be fighting to remain in the country she has called home for over a decade. Yet, a bureaucratic technicality threatens to uproot her life and academic career.Manikarnika Dutta , 37, an assistant professor at University College Dublin, is facing deportation from the UK after the Home Office deemed her ineligible for indefinite leave to remain (ILR). The reason? Her extensive research trips to India, where she accessed critical archives for her work on British imperial history, exceeded the maximum number of days allowed abroad under UK immigration rules, reported the Guardian.Dutta, who moved to the UK in 2012 for a master's degree at the University of Oxford, later pursued doctoral research and held positions at Oxford and the University of Bristol. Her academic commitments necessitated travel, yet those very commitments are now being used to justify her removal.UK Home Office rules allow ILR applicants to spend a maximum of 548 days outside the country over a 10-year period. Dutta exceeded this by 143 days—an overage caused by essential research trips and international conferences. Despite her argument that these trips were integral to her role, the Home Office ruled against her, reported the Guardian.Adding to the controversy, her husband, Dr Souvik Naha, a senior lecturer at the University of Glasgow, was granted ILR under the same application process, while Dutta was rejected. The Home Office further argued that she does not have a family life in Britain, despite being married and residing in London with her husband for over 10 years.“I was shocked when I got an email saying I have to leave,” Dutta told The Observer. “I have spent the majority of my adult life in the UK. I never thought something like this would happen to me.”Her lawyer, Naga Kandiah, has launched a legal challenge against the decision, emphasizing that her travel was not personal but essential for fulfilling academic responsibilities. The case has sparked an outcry in academic circles, with many arguing that the UK's approach risks alienating top-tier global scholars.Dutta is not alone. Other academics have faced similar issues, raising concerns that UK immigration policies are failing to accommodate the realities of academic research. Experts warn that such rigid rules could discourage global talent from considering the UK as a long-term base for research and innovation.For now, the Home Office has agreed to review her case over the next three months. But Dutta remains in limbo, unsure of whether she will be allowed to continue her career in the UK or forced to leave the country she has called home for more than a decade.A Home Office spokesperson stated: “It is longstanding government policy that we do not routinely comment on individual cases.” However, the implications of Dutta’s case extend far beyond her personal situation, raising urgent questions about the UK’s commitment to retaining world-class academic talent.","Manikarnika Dutta, an assistant professor at University College Dublin, is facing deportation from the UK.

TOI correspondent from London: The UK government has announced new rules for recruiting foreign care workers in the UK, prioritising foreign care workers already in the country above those based overseas. Indian nationals are currently the largest recipient of care worker visas in Britain.From April 9, care providers in the UK who want to recruit a new worker from overseas will have to first prove that they have attempted to recruit a foreign worker from within England who needs new sponsorship.Thousands of Indians who came to the UK on care worker visas have been left in destitute conditions, with some facing deportation.Many paid huge fees to agents in India to come to the UK, only to find the care company that sponsored their visa for does not exist or has no care work. Once their licence was revoked, they faced deportation.The new rules will allow this pool of workers to get hired. Seema Malhotra, minister for migration and citizenship, said: “Those who have come to the UK to support our adult care sector should have the opportunity to do so, free from abuse and exploitation.”Between July 2022 and December 2024, the UK government revoked 470 sponsor licences in the care sector to clamp down on abuse and exploitation. Over 39,000 workers have been associated with these sponsors since October 2020.","Indian nationals are currently the largest recipient of care worker visas in Britain.

"British peers call for return of skulls, bones sourced illegally",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/british-peers-call-for-return-of-skulls-bones-sourced-illegally/articleshow/119026599.cms,"UK peers have called for human remains being displayed in British museums to be returned to the communities they belong to, and a ban on the sale of the same. In the UK, human body parts can legally be held in museums and private collections, as well as be put up for sale. The call to return human remains follows an uproar last year over the sale of a 19th century skull belonging to the Nagas at an antique centre in Oxfordshire. The sale was called off later.A significant number of British museums and cultural institutions hold ancestral remains in their collections, acquired during the colonial era, often through violence. During a debate on the matter, the House of Lords was told on Thursday that a human skull can sell for over Rs 1 lakh. Real human bones are sold as art, or in gothic shops. ""At its peak, India was exporting over 60,000 skeletons each year for the instruction of medical students. It was a lucrative colonial trade route. India banned the sales in 1985,"" said crossbench peer Baroness Black of Strome.Alok Kumar Kanungo, a Naga culture scholar, estimates the UK museums and private collections hold around 50,000 Naga objects.Culture minister Baroness Twycross, representing the govt at the debate, said she was ""appalled"" by the objects on sale online. The British Museum alone holds over 6,000 human remains, including mummified bodies.","In the UK, human body parts can legally be held in museums and private collections.

Delhi tries last-resort attempt to appeal Sanjay Bhandari extradition judgment,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/delhi-tries-last-resort-attempt-to-appeal-sanjay-bhandari-extradition-judgment/articleshow/118990729.cms,"Sanjay Bhandari

LONDON: The Indian govt has applied to the London high court for a point of law of general public importance to be certified to allow India to appeal the Sanjay Bhandari extradition judgment in Britain’s Supreme Court.The Indian authorities are seeking to extradite Bhandari (62), a defence middleman residing in London, to face criminal charges of money laundering and wilfully evading taxes in India by not declaring foreign assets and foreign income on his Indian income tax returns, claiming he evaded Rs 197 crore in taxes, contrary to Sec 51 of the Black Money Act.In the tax years 2012 to 2013 and 2015 to 2016 Bhandari, an Indian national, declared he had nil foreign assets despite having amassed Rs 731 crore of foreign assets, the charges state.On Feb 28 two high court judges, Lord Justice Holroyde and Mrs Justice Steyn, ordered Bhandari’s discharge on two grounds, namely that his extradition him to India would be a breach of both Articles 3 (torture) and 6 (fair trial) of the ECHR ( European Convention on Human Rights ).The judges said he would be at real risk of extortion, accompanied by violence, from other prisoners, and also from prison officials inside Tihar jail — where he would be detained — as he was “perceived to be rich”.They commented that “incidents of prison officials, including senior officials, taking bribes, engaging in, and facilitating, extortion, occur all too commonly” in Tihar jail and the risk was not removed by India’s assurances, amounting to an ECHR Article 3 breach.They also said because Bhandari would have to prove the attempt to evade tax was not wilful, rather than prosecuting authorities having to prove it was wilful, this was a flagrant denial of his rights under Article 6.A high court official told TOI: “An application was filed on Wednesday by the respondent (Indian govt) to certify two points of law of general public importance; and grant leave to appeal to the Supreme Court in relation to those two questions.”TOI understands that Delhi’s argument is that reversing the burden of proof is not a “flagrant denial of justice” as per Article 6. Delhi also claims that it should have been asked to provide further assurances about Bhandari’s treatment in Tihar jail rather than the extradition being turned down under Article 3.Bhandari, represented by Edward Fitzgerald KC, had appealed in the high court under six grounds, but the other four grounds were dismissed.","The Indian govt has applied to the London high court for a point of law of general public importance to allow India to appeal the Sanjay Bhandari extradition judgment in Britain’s Supreme Court.

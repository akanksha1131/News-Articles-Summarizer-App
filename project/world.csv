Wynn Al Marjan recruitment 2026

2,700+ roles in Ras Al Khaimah



Jobs beyond the resort floor

Looking ahead





If you are a professional in the UAE looking for your next career milestone, all eyes are currently on Ras Al Khaimah. As construction on the iconic Wynn Al Marjan Island races toward its final floors, the project is shifting from a construction site to a massive employment engine.With a total of 2,700 jobs to fill by its early 2027 opening, the recruitment phases are already moving from executive leadership into mid-management and specialized technical roles.The Wynn Resorts-backed Wynn Al Marjan Island project, a multibillion-dollar integrated resort and entertainment destination in Ras Al Khaimah, is rapidly stepping up its recruitment drive to fill thousands of jobs ahead of its early 2027 opening.According to the 2025 annual report, the resort plans to hire around 2,750 employees during 2026, with the workforce expected to grow to about 3,000 by the end of the year as hiring picks up pace to meet operational and training needs. Recruitment so far has focused on senior management and administrative functions, but line-level staff hiring will intensify throughout the year.This hiring surge directly responds to the resort’s expanding footprint: Wynn Al Marjan Island is set to be one of the UAE’s largest integrated resort developments, featuring 1,530 rooms and suites, over 22 dining venues, retail spaces, a theatre and a marina, all of which require large teams across hospitality, operations, guest services and entertainment functions.By early 2026, the resort has listed around 112 vacancies across departments such as marketing, gaming operations, finance, F&B (food and beverage), events, IT, legal and retail. These roles target candidates with diverse skills and experience levels, ranging from specialised operational positions like gaming managers or F&B supervisors to corporate support and service roles.Job postings on public job boards reflect a similar variety, including operational, support and managerial roles. Examples of openings sought by the resort include pastry shop coordinator, off-site warehouse assistant manager, recreation coordinator for staff accommodation and executive chef roles, indicating that both frontline and skilled professional opportunities are part of the recruitment mix.For UAE residents and expatriates seeking careers in hospitality, service, logistics, IT or facility management, this hiring cycle represents one of the largest opportunities in the emirate outside of Dubai and Abu Dhabi.As the resort nears completion, applicants with experience in hotel operations, customer service, technology support and food and beverage management are particularly likely to find roles matching their profiles.Recognising that housing is a key concern for large numbers of incoming staff, Wynn Al Marjan has also announced a dedicated residential community for employees in 2026.Wynn Oasis, a purpose-built staff housing project covering over 105,000 square meters near Marjan Island, aims to accommodate more than 7,000 colleagues, roughly 80 % of the planned workforce, when it opens. The community will include amenities such as fitness facilities, recreation spaces and services to support residents’ wellbeing, a factor that can make relocation and onsite employment more attractive for job seekers.This focus on workforce infrastructure suggests that many of the jobs won’t just be seasonal or short-term; they are part of a longer-term employment ecosystem tied to the resort’s growth, operations and contribution to Ras Al Khaimah’s broader tourism and economic strategy.For people seeking employment opportunities in the UAE’s hospitality and service sectors, this recruitment push comes as the industry rapidly expands beyond traditional hubs. The Wynn project is expected to create not only direct resort jobs but also indirect roles in supply chains, retail, logistics and transportation, contributing to broader job growth in Ras Al Khaimah and the wider UAE tourism ecosystem.The resort’s construction milestones, including the topping out of its iconic 70-storey tower and ongoing interior works, signal that operations will soon shift into high gear, further increasing demand for trained staff ready to meet the resort’s five-star service standards.In sum, the Wynn Al Marjan hiring wave in 2026 offers UAE job seekers significant opportunities across many professional areas. With roles expanding beyond traditional hotel jobs into broader operational, corporate and technical fields, this recruitment drive could shape employment prospects in Ras Al Khaimah for years to come.","The Wynn Resorts-backed Wynn Al Marjan Island project, a multibillion-dollar integrated resort and entertainment destination in Ras Al Khaimah, is rapidly stepping up its recruitment drive.

When China declared war on sparrows and triggered history’s deadliest famines that no one expected,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/when-china-declared-war-on-sparrows-and-triggered-historys-deadliest-famines-that-no-one-expected/articleshow/128339972.cms,"When China declared war on sparrows and triggered history’s deadliest famines that no one expected



China’s sparrow eradication campaign contributed to ecological collapse and famine



Increased food procurement worsened shortages



Findings highlight risks of ecological disruption





In 1958, sparrows became a target across China. The order formed part of what was called the Four Pests Campaign. At the time, officials said the birds were eating too much grain. There were warnings from scientists, though they did not carry much weight. A new academic paper returns to that moment and looks at what followed. Drawing on digitised farm records and ecological modelling, the researchers suggest the loss of sparrows may have unsettled more than expected. Crop yields dipped in some areas. Mortality rose during the Great Chinese Famine between 1959 and 1961. The study estimates that close to two million additional deaths could be linked, indirectly, to the eradication effort. The number sits within a much larger tragedy.The research “CAMPAIGNING FOR EXTINCTION: ERADICATION OF SPARROWS AND THE GREAT FAMINE IN CHINA” compared counties where sparrows were naturally more common with those where they were less suited to the landscape. The differences show up after 1958. Rice output fell by around 5.3 percent more in counties with higher sparrow suitability. Wheat dropped by roughly 8.7 percent more.Both crops grow above the soil and are exposed to insects. Sparrows had fed on some of those insects.Once the birds were gone, insect numbers may have climbed. The paper does not dramatise this point. It simply notes that sweet potatoes, which grow underground, did not decline in the same way. In some places they did slightly better.There was also the matter of grain collection. Procurement targets rose during these years. Officials believed production had improved. In some of the counties most affected by sparrow loss, the opposite appears to have been true.Mortality rates were about 9.6 percent higher in areas with greater sparrow suitability. The worst year was 1960. The study suggests that nearly one-fifth of crop losses during the famine period could be associated with the eradication campaign. It does not claim this was the sole cause. Other factors were already in motion.The Great Chinese Famine resulted in tens of millions of deaths. Weather, policy and economic pressure all played a part. This research adds another layer, one tied to ecological balance.Sparrows, the authors argue, acted as a quiet control on insect populations. Removing them shifted something in the fields. The broader point is less about birds alone and more about systems. When one element is taken out, the response is not always immediate or obvious. Sometimes it shows up later, in numbers that are harder to absorb.","In 1958, sparrows became a target across China. The order formed part of what was called the Four Pests Campaign.

"Is religion declining? 1 in 4 worldwide now non-religious, becomes third-largest group as Christianity falls",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/etimes/trending/is-religion-declining-1-in-4-worldwide-now-non-religious-becomes-third-largest-group-as-christianity-falls/articleshow/128347484.cms,"Between 2010 and 2020, the religiously unaffiliated grew by 270 million to 1.9 billion, rising to 24.2% of the global population.

Who are the ‘ Nones ’?

17% of “nones” identify as atheist.



20% say they are agnostic.



63% describe their religion as “nothing in particular.”

Nonreligious “nones” are now the world’s third-largest group, including atheists, agnostics, spiritual-but-not-religious, and those unaffiliated with organized religion.

The unaffiliated now make up 24.2% of the global population, driven largely by Christian disaffiliation.

Are ‘Nones’ nonbelievers?

Growth despite a ‘demographic disadvantage’

Religious switching: The main driver

Religious switching, especially Christians leaving faith, drove the unaffiliated’s growth to 1.9 billion, despite older age and lower fertility.

Country-level changes

Religiously unaffiliated people gained at least five percentage points in 35 countries between 2010 and 2020.

Where the ‘Nones’ Are Concentrated

China, the United States, and Japan together account for the largest populations of religiously unaffiliated people globally.

A note on age patterns and Simpson’s Paradox

The broader global context

Nearly a quarter of the world’s population now identifies with no religion, according to the latest analysis from the Pew Research Center’s Pew-Templeton Global Religious Futures project. Drawing on more than 2,700 censuses and surveys and covering 201 countries and territories that together accounted for 99.98% of the global population in 2020, the study finds that religiously unaffiliated people, widely known as the “nones,” grew both in absolute number and as a share of humanity between 2010 and 2020.The number of people who identify as atheist, agnostic or “nothing in particular” rose by 270 million over the decade, reaching 1.9 billion in 2020. Their share of the global population climbed from 23.3% in 2010 to 24.2% in 2020. Alongside Muslims, they were the only major category to grow as a percentage of the world’s population during that period. Their expansion has had measurable effects on the size and distribution of other religious groups, most notably Christianity, and on the number of countries with Christian majorities.In Pew Research Center surveys and in national censuses, the “religiously unaffiliated” category includes people who describe themselves as atheist, agnostic or “nothing in particular” when asked about their religion. In other data sources, this group includes those who select “No religion” or “None.” Scholars in the United States have used the term “nones” since at least the 1960s, and it has since become common in academic and media discussions.The category is internally diverse. In Pew’s latest data:As of 2020, 75.8% of the world’s population identified with a religion, while 24.2%, about 1.9 billion people, did not. This makes the religiously unaffiliated the third-largest group globally, after Christians (2.3 billion) and Muslims (2.0 billion).Since 2010, the share of people with a religious affiliation has declined by nearly one percentage point, from 76.7%, while the proportion with no affiliation has risen by a similar margin, up from 23.3%.Not all “nones” reject belief in God or the supernatural. While they are far less likely than religiously affiliated people to believe in God “as described in the Bible,” most do believe in God or some higher power. Only 29% of “nones” say there is no higher power or spiritual force in the universe.Most were raised in a religion, typically Christianity. Their current identity reflects disaffiliation from religious institutions rather than necessarily the rejection of all spiritual belief. Their institutional disengagement is pronounced: 90% of religiously unaffiliated people say they seldom or never attend religious services.On science and religion, “nones” are not monolithic. Most reject the idea that science can explain everything. At the same time, they express more positive views of science than religiously affiliated Americans do. In surveys, 43% say religion does more harm than good in American society, but many also acknowledge that religion can provide meaning and encourage people to treat one another well. Their views are mixed rather than uniformly hostile.The expansion of the unaffiliated is notable because, demographically, they face structural headwinds.Globally, the unaffiliated have the smallest share of children under age 15 (19%), while Muslims have the smallest share of adults ages 50 and older (13%). On average, the unaffiliated population is older and has lower fertility rates than many religious groups. In demographic terms, this places them at a disadvantage compared with groups that have younger age structures and higher birth rates.Yet their share of the global population increased. The reason lies primarily in religious switching.Pew’s analysis of 117 countries and territories compared what adults ages 18 to 54 say about the religion in which they were raised with their current religious identity. Religious switching tends to occur earlier in life, so this age range captures recent movement.Globally, for every adult who joined a religion after being raised without one, 3.2 left religion altogether. For every 100 people ages 18 to 54 who were raised without religion, 7.5 left the unaffiliated category while 24.2 joined it, a net gain of 16.7. As a result, the religiously unaffiliated experienced the largest net gains from switching.Christians experienced the largest net losses: for every 1.0 person who joined Christianity, 3.1 left. Most former Christians became religiously unaffiliated, though some joined other religions. Buddhists also saw more departures than arrivals, with 1.8 leaving for every 1.0 who joined.Hindus experienced slightly more departures than arrivals, while Muslims experienced the reverse. However, switching into and out of Hinduism and Islam remains relatively uncommon, so these ratios have only modest overall effects on their global population sizes.Switching helps explain why Christian populations shrank as a share of the global population despite relatively high fertility, and why the unaffiliated grew as a percentage of humanity despite older age structures and lower fertility.Religiously unaffiliated people gained at least five percentage points in 35 countries between 2010 and 2020. A percentage point refers to the simple numerical difference between two percentages. For example, if a group made up 10% of a country’s population in 2010 and 15% in 2020, that represents a five-percentage-point increase. This is not the same as a 5% rise in the number of people; it reflects a change in share of the total population.The largest increases in the unaffiliated share occurred in the United States, which rose by 13 percentage points, Uruguay by 16 points, and both Chile and Australia by 17 points. These shifts indicate a significant change in religious identification within a relatively short period.Christians, meanwhile, experienced substantial declines, defined in the study as a drop of at least five percentage points, in 41 countries, more than any other religious group. In all but one case, Christianity shrank as a proportion of the national population. The decreases ranged from a five-point drop in Benin to a 14-point decline in the United States and a 20-point fall in Australia.These changes altered religious majorities in several countries. As of 2020, Christians remained a majority in 120 countries and territories, down from 124 in 2010. Their share fell below 50% in the United Kingdom (49%), Australia (47%), France (46%) and Uruguay (44%). In each of these nations, the religiously unaffiliated now account for 40% or more of the population.The number of places with an unaffiliated majority increased from seven to 10 over the decade. The Netherlands (54%), Uruguay (52%) and New Zealand (51%) joined China, North Korea, the Czech Republic, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Macao and Japan, which already had unaffiliated majorities in 2010.By contrast, there was no change in the number of Muslim-majority countries (53), Buddhist-majority countries (7), Jewish-majority countries (1) or countries where “other religions” form a majority (1), indicating greater stability in those religious distributions during the same period.China remains the country with the largest number of religiously unaffiliated people. In 2020, about 1.3 billion people — roughly 90% of its population, identified as unaffiliated.The United States now has the second-largest number, with approximately 101 million religious “nones,” marking a 97% increase from a decade earlier. They make up about 30% of the U.S. population. Japan follows with 73 million unaffiliated people, up 8% over the same period, representing 57% of its population.China’s unaffiliated population alone is roughly seven times the combined total in the United States and Japan. Together, these three countries account for a substantial share of the global unaffiliated population.At the global level, unaffiliated people are older, on average, than affiliated populations. However, at the country level, the opposite pattern often appears. In China, Japan and most countries in Europe and the America, including the United States, the unaffiliated are younger than the affiliated.This apparent contradiction is an example of Simpson’s paradox. Because China and Japan have very large populations and high median ages, their demographic patterns heavily influence global averages. Both have unaffiliated majorities and aging populations, which shifts the global age profile upward.Between 2010 and 2020, the global population increased, and most religious groups grew in absolute numbers. However, only Muslims and the religiously unaffiliated expanded their share of the world’s population during that period.Christians remained the largest religious group worldwide, numbering 2.3 billion people in 2020. Yet their global share declined by 1.8 percentage points, falling to 28.8%. In contrast, Muslims grew by 347 million, more than all other religions combined, raising their share to 25.6% of the global population.The religiously unaffiliated also saw substantial growth, increasing by 270 million to reach 24.2% of humanity. Unlike many religious groups, this rise was not driven primarily by fertility rates. Instead, it stemmed largely from religious disaffiliation, particularly from Christianity. The net movement away from religion was strong enough to offset the unaffiliated population’s older age profile and lower birth rates, reshaping religious balances in dozens of countries.By 2020, nearly one in four people worldwide identified with no religion. While the pace and scale of change varied across regions and traditions, the overall shift was significant enough to reduce the number of Christian-majority countries and increase the number of nations where the religiously unaffiliated form a majority.","The number of people who identify as atheist, agnostic or “nothing in particular” rose by 270 million over the decade, reaching 1.9 billion in 2020.

"Sikh student assaulted after being mistaken for ‘Hindu’ at San Jose State University, Hindu groups condemn attack",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/sikh-student-assaulted-after-being-mistaken-for-hindu-at-san-jose-state-university-hindu-groups-condemn-attack/articleshow/128364915.cms,"Hindu groups respond, cite bias concerns

University statement and clarification





A Sikh student was assaulted on the campus of San Jose State University after being mistaken for Hindu, prompting condemnation from Hindu advocacy groups and renewed calls for stronger campus security. The incident, which occurred on 7 February, is being investigated by campus and local authorities as a possible hate crime.According to university officials, the student was attacked by a group of individuals who allegedly forced him to the ground and tore off his turban. During the assault, the attackers reportedly used the word “Hindu” as a slur, indicating a case of misidentification paired with bias-driven language. The suspects are believed to be non-students, and no arrests have been announced so far. Authorities say surveillance footage is being reviewed and witnesses interviewed.The CoHNA Youth Action Network (CYAN), the youth wing of the Coalition of Hindus of North America, condemned the attack in a statement issued on 13 February. While acknowledging that the victim is Sikh, the group said the alleged use of “Hindu” as a slur alongside physical violence points to anti-Hindu bias.CYAN said it stands in solidarity with the Sikh student and the Sikh community on campus, while also urging authorities to accurately identify the bias involved. The group argued that naming the prejudice correctly is essential for accountability, prevention, and student safety.San Jose State University president Cynthia Teniente-Matson condemned the assault, calling hate crimes “evil acts that harm entire communities.” She said the university does not tolerate hate, discrimination, or violence and is committed to supporting affected students, faculty, and staff.The university also acknowledged errors in its initial campus communication, which misidentified the victim’s religious identity, and later issued a clarification. Officials said the correction was made once more accurate information became available.CYAN and other advocates said the incident should not be viewed in isolation. The group cited data from the California Civil Rights Department, noting that a significant share of religion-based hate incidents reported in California in 2024 targeted Hindus. While the victim in this case was Sikh, CYAN said the alleged slur reflects overlapping vulnerabilities faced by Sikh and Hindu students.The organisation also raised concerns about campus security, pointing to the reported involvement of non-students as a sign of potential gaps. It urged university leadership to strengthen protections, engage directly with Hindu and Sikh student organisations, provide trauma-informed support services, and implement awareness programmes addressing religious bias.San Jose State University has said it continues to cooperate with law enforcement and treats hate crimes with seriousness. As the investigation remains ongoing, student groups and community organisations are calling for transparency, accountability, and steps to ensure the safety of religious minorities on campus.","A Sikh student was assaulted on the campus of San Jose State University after being mistaken for Hindu.

'We were not consulted': Imran Khan’s sister

Pakistan’s information minister Ataullah Tarar on Saturday announced that imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan will undergo treatment for an eye condition at a specialised medical facility, days after the Supreme Court ordered a medical evaluation amid growing concerns about the cricketer-turned-politician’s eyesight.Tarar wrote on X that an examination would be conducted by leading eye specialists as part of Khan’s ongoing treatment, which began in late January after the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder-chairman claimed ""partial loss of vision"" in his right eye.The minister, however, did not specify the medical facility or the date of treatment and urged the public to avoid speculation.“A detailed report will also be submitted to the Supreme Court. Conjecture, speculations, and efforts to turn this into political rhetoric and mileage for vested interests may please be avoided,” Tarar posted.Earlier this week, Khan’s lawyer and PTI member Salman Safdar told the Supreme Court that the ex-premier had lost roughly 85% of vision in his right eye. The court subsequently directed authorities to arrange a medical assessment by a panel of doctors and facilitate a telephone call between Khan and his two UK-based sons before February 16.PTI supporters have staged protests in the capital, Islamabad, and other cities, demanding that their party chief be shifted from prison to a hospital for specialised treatment. Some lawmakers from PTI and its allies are also staging a sit-in outside Parliament.Meanwhile, Khan’s sister Aleema Khan reacted angrily to Tarar's announcement, saying the family had not been consulted and demanding that family members and his personal physician be present during any future procedures.She confirmed that, following the Supreme Court’s directive, authorities had arranged a call between her brother and his two sons, who live with their mother and his former wife, British screenwriter and producer Jemima Goldsmith.Khan was removed from office in a parliamentary no-confidence vote in April 2022. He has alleged that his ouster was the result of a US-backed “conspiracy” involving political rivals and Pakistan’s then army chief, Qamar Javed Bajwa — allegations denied by Washington, Pakistan’s military, and Khan’s political opponents.The issue of Khan’s partial vision surfaced in late January when the federal government said the former prime minister had undergone a medical procedure for an eye condition and was in ""good health.""The PTI made a strong showing in the February 2024 parliamentary elections but did not secure a majority in the National Assembly, the lower house of Parliament. The party alleged the vote was “rigged,” a claim the government has denied.","Pakistan’s information minister Ataullah Tarar on Saturday announced that imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan will undergo treatment for an eye condition.

The transfer follows:

A nearly week-long hunger strike protesting prison conditions

Hospitalisation due to health complications

Reports of physical abuse during arrest and interrogation

New prison sentence and internal exile

Six years for “gathering and collusion to commit crimes”

One-and-a-half years for propaganda activities

Two years of internal exile to Khosf in South Khorasan province

A two-year ban on leaving the country

Growing health concerns

Who is Narges Mohammadi?

Iran’s use of the death penalty

Solitary confinement in prisons

Mandatory hijab laws for women

Restrictions on political freedoms

Nobel Peace Prize recognition

A life marked by repeated imprisonment





Iranian authorities have transferred Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi without prior notice to a prison in northern Iran, raising fresh concerns over her health and treatment in detention.Her family says the move, from a detention facility in Mashhad to Zanjan prison, was carried out without informing her lawyer or relatives, news agency AFP reported. The sudden relocation comes amid rising international alarm about reports of physical abuse, deteriorating medical conditions, and prolonged isolation.Mohammadi was arrested on December 12 in Mashhad after publicly criticising Iran’s clerical authorities during a funeral ceremony. She was initially held at a detention facility run by the intelligence ministry.According to her husband, Taghi Rahmani, who lives in Paris, the transfer to Zanjan prison was intended to “exile and displace” her. Her lawyer, Mostafa Nili, said she was only able to reveal details of the move days later during a brief phone call.Her lawyer has alleged she suffered severe blows to the head, resulting in dizziness, double vision, and blurred eyesight.Bruises and marks of assault were reportedly still visible.In February 2026, Mohammadi was sentenced to more than seven years in prison:Her legal team says the verdict is not final and may be appealed. They have expressed hope she could be temporarily released on bail for medical treatment.Health worries have followed Mohammadi for years. In November 2024, she underwent complex surgery in Iran in which part of a bone in her right leg was removed over cancer fears. Despite the seriousness of the procedure, she was reportedly returned to prison immediately afterward.Earlier this year, she launched another hunger strike to protest restrictions on contacting her family and lawyers. Her foundation described her physical condition as “deeply alarming.”Born April 21, 1972, in Zanjan, Mohammadi is one of Iran’s most prominent human rights activists. She serves as deputy director of the Defenders of Human Rights Center, an organization co-founded by Nobel laureate Shirin Ebadi.Over more than two decades, she has campaigned against:She became a leading voice during unrest following the 2022 death of Jina Mahsa Amini, which triggered nationwide protests.In October 2023, while imprisoned, Mohammadi was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize “for her fight against the oppression of women in Iran and her fight to promote human rights and freedom for all.”The Norwegian Nobel Committee later said it was “deeply appalled” by reports of mistreatment during her detention. Iran’s foreign ministry condemned the award.Mohammadi has been repeatedly arrested and jailed over the past 25 years. In 2016, she was sentenced to 16 years in prison on charges related to her activism. Though released in 2020, she was re-arrested in 2021 and has since continued reporting alleged abuse of detained women from inside prison.At 53, she has become both a symbol of resistance inside Iran and a globally recognised advocate for women’s rights and human dignity, even as she remains behind bars.Her latest transfer to Zanjan prison, the city where she was born, highlights the ongoing tensions between Iranian authorities and one of the country’s most internationally visible critics.","Narges Mohammadi was transferred without prior notice to a prison in northern Iran.

Saketh Sreenivasaiah, a 22-year-old Indian student in the US, was found dead, the Consulate General of India, San Francisco said on Sunday. According to news agency PTI, Saketh had been reported missing in Berkeley since the morning of February 9.In a post on X, the consulate said local police had confirmed the recovery of Saketh’s body. It added that consular officers are in direct contact with the family and will support them with all required formalities and services.“The Consulate deeply regrets to inform that local police have confirmed the recovery of the body of the missing Indian student, Saketh Sreenivasaiah. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his family and loved ones during this profoundly difficult time,” the consulate said.“The Consulate stands ready to provide all necessary assistance to the family, including coordination with local authorities and arrangements for the repatriation of the mortal remains to India at the earliest.

Ruemmler's ties to Epstein

Emails detail advice, personal exchanges and years-long ties





Kathryn Ruemmler, chief legal officer at Goldman Sachs and one of the highest paid lawyers in the US, resigned on Thursday night after the justice department released emails and other documents detailing her extensive relationship with infamous financier and convicted sex offender, Jeffrey Epstein For years, Ruemmler and the financial services firm had maintained that her contact with Epstein was strictly professional. However, emails, text messages and photographs released to the public last month presented a completely different picture, indicating that the lawyer had been closer to him even before she joined Goldman in 2020.Goldman’s chief executive David M Solomon said in a statement that he had accepted her resignation, “and I respect her decision.”Ruemmler had been general counsel since 2021 and also served as a partner and vice chair of the bank’s reputational risk committee. Earlier, she worked as White House counsel under Barack Obama and later as a white-collar defence lawyer at Latham & Watkins.“My responsibility is to put Goldman Sachs' interests first,” Ruemmler said.Goldman had defended her in recent weeks, saying that her links with Epstein happened before she was hired and were appropriate.However, the Justice Department’s latest release, more than 10,000 documents mentioning her, showed a relationship that stretched over many years.The records showed Ruemmler acting as a counsellor, confidant and friend to Epstein. She advised him on how to answer difficult questions about his sex crimes, spoke about her own dating life, discussed ways to avoid negative media coverage and called him “sweetie” and “Uncle Jeffrey”.According to The Guardian, an email “So lovely and thoughtful! Thank you to Uncle Jeffrey!!!” Ruemmler wrote to Epstein in 2018.In return, Epstein offered career guidance about her move to Goldman, introduced her to prominent businesspeople and gave her gifts including spa treatments, luxury goods and high-end travel. Furthermore, within the hundreds of messages examined by CNN about Epstein’s legal troubles and damage to his reputation, there were also more intimate notes between the pair, including talk of a potential trip to his island and references to presents he had given her.From 2014, Kathryn began what she described in one email as a “friendship”. She explained Epstein how the law distinguishes between underage victims of sex crimes and adult prostitutes. “I think the point is that if she was underage, she could not legally consent to engaging in prostitution,” Ruemmler wrote to Epstein in 2015.She also advised the disgraced financer on how to challenge the credibility of an accuser, saying in one message that his lawyer could push the woman into a “perjury trap.”Back in 2015, on Epstein’s 62nd birthday, Ruemmler sent him an email, writing, “I hope you enjoy the day with your one true love. :-)”. Some emails ended with “xoxo”, and the two exchanged photographs. In other conversations, she joked about the weight of visitors at New Jersey rest stops and speculated about the sexual orientation of a well-known hedge fund billionaire, according to the New York Times.Ruemmler, over a series of meetings, also asked for Epstein’s views on personal and professional issues, including her dating concerns. “men aren't interested in women my age,” one email said.Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs and Ruemmler have maintained that Epstein was never her client. Yet in 2018, when she helped him edit a legal document defending his 2008 plea deal for soliciting prostitution from a minor, the emails between them carried the subject line, “Attorney Client.”","Kathryn Ruemmler, chief legal officer at Goldman Sachs and one of the highest paid lawyers in the US, resigned on Thursday night.

‘No discussions for specific operations’: Anthropic denies Claude’s use by US military,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/no-discussions-for-specific-operations-anthropic-denies-claudes-use-by-us-military/articleshow/128370317.cms,".





AI firm Anthropic has stated that it has not held discussions with the US's department of war regarding the use of its AI system, Claude, for specific operations.""Anthropic has not discussed the use of Claude for specific operations with the department of war,"" the AI firm said, as cited by Reuters.Meanwhile, the Pentagon is reportedly considering ending its relationship with Anthropic over the company’s restrictions on how its models are used, Axios reported on Saturday, citing a senior administration official.The US military has asked four leading AI labs to allow the use of their tools for “all lawful purposes,” including sensitive areas such as weapons development, intelligence gathering, and battlefield operations. Anthropic has not agreed to these terms, leading to mounting frustration within the Pentagon after months of difficult negotiations.Anthropic has maintained that two areas must remain off-limits: mass surveillance of Americans and fully autonomous weaponry. A senior administration official noted that there is significant ambiguity over what falls within these categories, making it impractical for the Pentagon to negotiate individual use cases with Anthropic or risk the AI system, Claude, unexpectedly blocking certain applications.Tensions between the Pentagon and Anthropic escalated after The Wall Street Journal reported that the US military used Anthropic’s artificial intelligence model, Claude, during the operation to capture former Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.Claude was reportedly deployed as part of Anthropic’s collaboration with data analytics company Palantir Technologies, whose platforms are extensively used by the US department of defence and federal law enforcement agencies.In early January, US forces captured Nicolás Maduro and his wife during strikes on multiple sites in Caracas, and Maduro was flown to New York to face federal drug trafficking charges.Anthropic’s usage policies explicitly prohibit Claude from being used to facilitate violence, develop weapons, or conduct surveillance. The Wall Street Journal reports that the AI model was involved in a raid that included bombing operation, whichs has drawn attention to how artificial intelligence tools are being deployed in military contexts and whether existing safeguards are effective.According to the report, disagreements over the Pentagon’s desired use of Claude have contributed to growing tensions between the AI firm and US defence officials, with some administration officials considering cancelling a contract worth up to $200 million.Anthropic was reportedly the first AI developer whose model was used in classified operations by the department of defence, though it remains unclear whether other AI systems were used in the Venezuela mission for unclassified tasks.Claude is an advanced artificial intelligence chatbot and large language model developed by US-based AI company Anthropic. Designed for tasks such as text generation, reasoning, coding, and data analysis, Claude competes with other large language models, including OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini.The system can summarise documents, answer complex queries, generate reports, assist with programming, and analyse large volumes of text.","Anthropic says it has not discussed the use of Claude for specific operations with the department of war.

US Exits Mideast Base As Tensions With Iran Intensify Amid Trump's Warning | Watch





The United States has intensified its military campaign against Islamic State (ISIS) targets in Syria, with US Central Command (Centcom) releasing new footage and operational details from what it described as a sustained counterterrorism effort under Operation Hawkeye Strike.In a statement issued on Saturday, Centcom said the operation was launched following a December ambush in Palmyra that killed two US service members and an American interpreter.The campaign, initiated under the Trump administration, was framed by US officials as a response aimed at holding ISIS operatives accountable for the attack and preventing the group from regrouping in the region.The update shared by the US Centcom accompanied a warning that attacks on US personnel would be met with force. “Our message remains strong: if you harm our warfighters, we will find you and kill you anywhere in the world, no matter how hard you try to evade justice,” the statement said.According to Centcom, the latest phase of the operation ran from February 3 to February 12 and involved 10 precision strikes targeting more than 30 ISIS-linked sites.The strikes focused on weapons storage facilities, communications infrastructure and logistical hubs believed to support the group’s operations.Aircraft deployed in the campaign included F-15E Strike Eagles, A-10 Warthogs, AC-130J Ghostriders and MQ-9 Reaper drones, with Jordanian F-16s providing support.US officials said that since the launch of Operation Hawkeye Strike on December 19, 2025, at least 50 ISIS fighters have been killed or captured. The operation followed the Dec. 13 attack in Palmyra, in which a gunman described as a recent recruit to Syrian security forces with extremist ties carried out the assault before being killed at the scene.In the weeks after the attack, Secretary of War Pete Hegseth described the US response as a targeted operation rather than the beginning of a broader conflict, calling it a “declaration of vengeance.”Centcom also said the campaign forms part of wider efforts to stabilise the region amid shifting political dynamics in Syria. As part of these measures, more than 5,700 detained ISIS suspects were recently transferred from facilities in Syria to Iraq, a move officials said was intended to reduce the risk of mass jailbreaks and prevent the group from rebuilding its ranks.",The United States has intensified its military campaign against Islamic State (ISIS) targets in Syria.

US Judge JOLTS Trump’s Minnesota ‘Clean-up’, Orders ICE To Stop Detaining Refugees | 'Stop Terror'





Over 400 federal judges have ruled more than 4,400 times since October that the Trump administration is illegally detaining immigrants. This comes as detention numbers under Trump have jumped 75% to 68,000, sparking over 20,200 federal lawsuits from detainees seeking release, according to a Reuters report.The rulings challenge Trump's departure from a decades-old policy that allowed immigrants living in the US to remain free on bond while their cases proceed. Despite these court decisions, the administration continues to jail people indefinitely.""It is appalling that the Government insists that this Court should redefine or completely disregard the current law as it is clearly written,"" wrote US District Judge Thomas Johnston, a George W Bush appointee, in a recent case involving a Venezuelan detainee.The surge in cases has overwhelmed the Justice Department, forcing attorneys who usually handle criminal matters to defend immigration cases instead. Court records show more than 700 Justice Department lawyers working on immigration cases, with five attorneys each handling over 1,000 habeas cases.The crackdown has affected many immigrants without criminal records. Recent cases include a five-year-old Ecuadorean boy detained in his Minnesota driveway, a Ukrainian man with valid humanitarian status, and a Salvadoran father of a US citizen child with autism.Some detainees are facing significant hurdles in seeking relief. Many can't afford lawyers, with fees reaching $5,000 for habeas petitions. Others aren't aware of their right to file such cases or struggle to find legal representation.However, the administration defends its actions. White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said they're ""working to lawfully deliver on President Trump's mandate to enforce federal immigration law."" DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin blamed ""activist judges"" for attempting to block Trump's deportation agenda.The situation has led to violations of court orders. In Minnesota, judges found the government had violated 96 orders in 76 cases. Similar violations have been reported in New York, where judges have had to issue emergency rulings to prevent detainees from being moved to other states.","Rulings challenge Trump's departure from decades-old policy that allowed immigrants living in the US to remain free on bond.

Bondi Watches, Dems Freeze: Fitzgerald Drops Obama Video Backing Trump-Style Ops Against Illegals





Former US president Barack Obama stated that he believes in the existence of aliens but admitted he does not know where such life might be, during a podcast interview released on Saturday.“They’re real,” Obama said when asked about the existence of extraterrestrial life, in an interview with YouTuber Brian Tyler Cowen.“But I haven’t seen them. They’re not being kept at Area 51. There’s no underground facility — unless there’s this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the President of the United States,” the former president added.Area 51 is a highly secretive US Air Force base located in Groom Lake, Nevada, long surrounded by speculation and conspiracy theories suggesting the government may be concealing alien technology or remains.Interest in the possibility of extraterrestrial contact has increased in recent years, following the release of government documents detailing unexplained aircraft sightings.Among these are leaked radar recordings from US Air Force Reaper drones, captured 13 years ago, which reportedly show Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs), the government’s current term for UFOs, operating over the Middle East, as cited by the New York Post.This is not the first occasion on which Obama has spoken about UFOs and extraterrestrial life.“When it comes to aliens, there are some things I just can’t tell you on air,” he told The Late Late Show host James Corden in a 2021 interview.He also acknowledged that sightings of Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs) were real, adding that the government has been unable to determine the origin of the aircraft or explain their unusual flight patterns.“But what is true — and I’m actually being serious here — is that there’s footage and records of objects in the skies that we don’t know exactly what they are,” Obama had said.","Obama said he believes in the existence of aliens but does not know where such life might be.

Obama Era Lawyer Kathy Ruemmler Rocked As Epstein Message Resurfaces | Watch

Karyna Shuliak’s case

Marriage and citizenship

Work visas





Newly released files from the US Department of Justice show how Jeffrey Epstein used student visas, English-language schools, work permits and marriages to manage the immigration status of women in his orbit.Emails, bank records and legal correspondence reveal a pattern: enrolling women in language programs to secure student visas, sponsoring their expenses, pursuing special work visas and, in at least one case, arranging a marriage to obtain permanent residency and citizenship.In a 2012 email exchange about an unidentified woman’s travel plans, Epstein wrote: “Call immigration , does she need an I 20 with her visa ???” Messages show two associates scrambling to get answers before a flight the next morning. When the woman did not board, one person expressed relief: “I am glad she didn’t go,” they wrote. “I felt sick at the thought of her coming back on Je plane and something going wrong.”The records show that English-language schools were often used as an entry point. In November 2010, Karyna Shuliak enrolled at the Spanish American Institute in Midtown Manhattan. Such programs could provide the paperwork needed for a student visa, as long as applicants demonstrated sufficient funds or had a financial sponsor.Emails and bank statements indicate Epstein sponsored and paid fees for multiple women.“this is the english language school that anna in paris would like to join,” Epstein wrote in 2017 regarding the American Language Communication Center, as quoted by Bloomberg. “Get an I 20 issued and get a visa shees russian but staying in paris.”The courses frequently prepared students for the TOEFL exam, required for many US colleges. In 2015, one employee wrote: “Jeffrey is in need of TOEFL books again for the island,” asking for books to be sent overnight. Later emails show Epstein requested 10 TOEFL prep books for his Paris apartment.Shuliak’s case illustrates how immigration hurdles were handled.Epstein arranged her admission to Columbia University’s dental school in 2011 as a transfer student from Belarus who had not completed her degree. The process was described in the files as complicated.By mid-2012, concerns arose about her visa status. “I am so sorry if you were given the run a round with the immigration office today,” a Columbia dental school official wrote to Shuliak in July 2012. “At this time I believe that everything is fine with your immigration status.” Columbia and the official did not respond to requests for comment.Epstein sought additional help. In late 2012, he contacted British investor Ian Osborne.“I don’t want to ask as I prefer her not to be a part of my file,” Epstein wrote. “I recall you had a good lawyer friend for immigrarion in washington.”Osborne replied that he knew someone connected to senior immigration officials and mentioned Greg Craig, then a partner at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom and a former White House counsel to President Barack Obama. Craig “uses an excellent specialist immigration law firm – and then gives Ali Mayorkas over at INS the heads-up,” Osborne wrote. “I will call you later today to coordinate.”Mayorkas, who later served as Secretary of Homeland Security under President Joe Biden , is not mentioned again in the messages, and there is no indication he was aware of the matter. Osborne said he regretted meeting Epstein and was unaware of his illegal behaviour.Lawyers later told Epstein that Shuliak had overstayed her student visa and had a pending asylum case, complicating efforts to reinstate her status. “We will need to decide if pushing the asylum and redoing it, is a more like path to sucess than the prosecutorial descretion re the reinstatement,” Epstein wrote.By August 2013, Epstein was working with immigration lawyer Arda Beskardes.“We should also talk about the marriage asap. are you in NYC?” Beskardes wrote to Epstein and a redacted address.A month later, Shuliak contacted the lawyer. “ Can we meet sometime tomorrow? That will be me and Jen,” she wrote.On October 9, 2013, Shuliak married in New York. The spouse’s name was redacted from the marriage certificate, but both listed the same Manhattan address that appears repeatedly in the files as housing women and guests connected to Epstein. Records later showed Shuliak and Jennifer held a joint bank account.“Yes Arda, sorry for the delay, waiting for the rest of the info from Jen,” Shuliak wrote in response to a follow-up from Beskardes, as reported by Bloomberg.In mid-2014, Shuliak applied for a family-based Green Card. An interview was scheduled by December. In January 2015, she wrote to Beskardes: “I have received my green card!! Thank you so much for all your help!!!”Three years later, she was naturalised as a US citizen. On the day of her citizenship interview, one of Epstein’s regular immigration lawyers sent a celebratory message: “now that she’s an american you should throw her a big ole party,” the lawyer wrote. “with a mechanical bull, red white and blue balloons, and deep fried snickers bars on flag toothpicks”.Shuliak began divorce proceedings in October 2018, months after becoming a citizen. The divorce was finalised less than a year later.The files also show efforts to secure work visas for women associated with Epstein.His long-time legal adviser, Darren Indyke, filed a work visa application for one woman, citing her volunteer work with Epstein’s foundation and her modelling career.In other cases, lawyers sought O-1 visas, reserved for individuals with “extraordinary ability or achievement,” describing applicants as accomplished in modelling, communications, public relations and art curation. It is unclear how many petitions were approved.A former bookkeeper for MC2 Model Management said in a sworn deposition that Epstein guaranteed a $1 million credit line to the agency. Its founder, Jean-Luc Brunel, was accused in a civil lawsuit of bringing underage girls to the US for sexual purposes and supplying them to Epstein. Brunel died in 2022 while facing rape charges.“Mr Epstein was paying for the visas. But, you know, all the visas were done through – through Karin’s or MC Squared,” the former bookkeeper said.","Emails, bank records and legal correspondence reveal a pattern: enrolling women in language programs to secure student visas, sponsoring their expenses, pursuing special work visas and, in at least one case, arranging a marriage to obtain permanent residency and citizenship.

Former President of the United States of America, Barack Obama has spoken out for the first time about the racist video of him and his wife Michelle that was posted by Trump on Truth Social recently. In an interview with journalist Brian Tyler Cohen, he called his successor's behaviour ""deeply troubling"" and termed it a ""clown show.""“Just days ago Donald Trump put a picture of you, your face on an ape’s body — and so again, we’ve kind of seen the devolution of the discourse,” said Cohen. “How do we come back from the place that we have fallen into?” he asked.Obama, 64, said that the majority of Americans found this behaviour deeply troubling. While it received attention and created a distraction, he claimed there were still people in the country who believed in the values of decency, courtesy and kindness. “First of all, I think it’s important to recognise that the majority of the American people find this behaviour deeply troubling,” Obama responded. “It is true that it gets attention. It’s true that it’s a distraction, but as I’m travelling around the country, as you’re travelling around the country, you meet people — they still believe in decency, courtesy, kindness.”He stated that there was a ""sort of clown show"" playing out on social media and on television, adding that the sense of propriety and decorum for the office has been lost. “What is true is there doesn’t seem to be any shame about this among people who used to feel like you had to have some sense of decorum and a sense of propriety and respect for the office. So that’s been lost,” he added.This marks the first time Obama has spoken out about the racist now-deleted video that the President posted on Truth Social on February 6, 2026. It featured animated versions of Barack and Michelle Obama depicted as apes while 'The Lion Sleeps Tonight' played in the background. While the post created much outrage online, Trump claimed he ""didn't see"" the racist bit in it and added he ""didn't make a mistake"" while refusing to apologise.Elsewhere in the interview, Obama also praised Bad Bunny's Super Bowl LX halftime performance. He said people who don't speak Spanish and had never been to Puerto Rico were enjoying the artist's show. ""It was a reminder of what Dr King called the beloved community can look like... There's room for everybody here. And that I think is where we win,"" he said, while also acknowledging that ""not all the lyrics were politically correct.

A 25-year-old man allegedly went on a violent rampage inside a Brooklyn subway station on Saturday morning, pushing one woman onto the tracks and punching another in the face before being taken into custody, police said.The shocking incident unfolded around 8:45 a.m. at the 53rd Street station on the R line in Sunset Park. According to authorities, the suspect first approached a 51-year-old woman standing on the platform and punched her in the face without provocation.Moments later, he allegedly turned toward a 43-year-old woman and shoved her onto the tracks. The victim managed to scramble to safety before an oncoming train arrived, officials said.Officers from the NYPD’s 72nd Precinct and Transit District 34 rushed to the scene. Both women were taken to a nearby hospital and are expected to survive. The 51-year-old sustained facial injuries, while the other victim reported pain in her knee and back.Police sources said the suspect fled the station immediately after the attacks. Following a search of the surrounding area, officers tracked him down at a shelter on the 5100 block of 20th Avenue and took him into custody for questioning.Charges were pending as of Saturday evening, with the investigation ongoing.The incident comes amid concerns over safety in the city’s transit system.

Musk accused Hoffman of ""dark deeds"" and repeated visits to Epstein's properties, while Hoffman countered that the FBI cleared him. The exchange, fueled by newly released Epstein files, highlights differing accounts of their interactions with the disgraced financier.

Epstein Death Shock: Doctor Claims Injuries Point To Strangling, Not Suicide | Watch

Liar, you are guilty of dark deeds and haven’t been cleared of anything.







You stayed at Epstein’s island, Epstein’s ranch in New Mexico and Epstein’s house in New York. You offered to help him with PR. You gave him gifts …







Maybe if it was only one stay over, you could claim it…





— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 14, 2026









Tesla CEO Elon Musk and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman recently traded jabs online, accusing each other over their past relationships with Jeffrey Epstein. Both business tycoons claimed the other had potential criminal conduct tied to associations with the late child sex offender.Both Musk and Hoffman have been featured in the latest release of Epstein files by the Department of Justice, revealing new angles into their relations with Epstein. On Friday, the X owner took to his social media platform calling for Hoffman to be ""investigated"" over his ties to the disgraced financier.Hoffman fired back in a post claiming the FBI had already ""cleared"" him of any connections, but Musk on the other hand was yet to be investigated. ""The FBI cleared me. You on the other hand…"" he wrote.Musk, who is known for not taking threats lightly launched into a blistering attack against the tech billionaire, calling him a ""liar"" and pointing out that Hoffman visited Epstein's island, his ranch in New Mexico and his house in New York about three times, which could not be a ""mistake.""“Liar, you are guilty of dark deeds and haven’t been cleared of anything. You stayed at Epstein’s island, Epstein’s ranch in New Mexico and Epstein’s house in New York.You offered to help him with PR. You gave him gifts,” Musk wrote in a social media post on X late Friday night.“Maybe if it was only one stay over, you could claim it was a mistake. Maybe. But there is NO possible explanation for the second time, let alone the third time. As the record shows, you were an eager repeat customer.”The origins of the tussle go back to Tuesday when Musk accused Hoffman of having visited Epstein's private island. “The big difference between you and me, Reid, is that you went and I did not. In fact, you went multiple times,” he wrote in an X post, rejecting any comparison between their associations with Epstein.“And, as the email shows, I obviously didn’t anticipate anything actually shady, as I was bringing my wife at the time (Talulah). Nonetheless, UNLIKE YOU, I came to my senses and declined to go. Epstein tried to get me to go to his island so many times that eventually I just blocked him,” Musk said in a follow-up post.However, as per Hoffman, his encounters with Epstein were for institutional funding rather than personal ties. He said his visits were made in an effort to raise money for the MIT Media Lab, which he was working on alongside the lab's former director Joi Ito.Musk, who previously claimed that Epstein ""tried repeatedly"" to get him to visit his private island, was actually revealed to have asked for an invitation to Little Saint James himself. In a 2012 email sent to Epstein, he asked which night would be ""the wildest party on your island"" while noting that he would likely be accompanied by his then-wife, Talulah Riley . However, it remains unclear if Musk followed through on the attendance.As for Hoffman, the billionaire venture capitalist's account of his ties with Epstein was also contradicted by the new documents. In 2019, he told the Axios publication that his last contact with Epstein was in 2015, but later acknowledged meeting him at least six times after that, including three in-person encounters. However, he had not been cleared by the FBI in any investigation over Epstein files. Trump did order a probe into the ties of many Democrats with the late criminal in 2025 but the results of the same are yet to be made public, if investigated.The two have frequently engaged in an online tussle previously. In March 2025, Musk accused Hoffman of funding protests against Tesla, which the billionaire denied, pointing out that some simply may not like the Tesla CEO. As per Hoffman, their beef lies in his ""having made OpenAI successful with his departure"", after Musk left OpenAI's board. ""Because he left saying, you know, 'You're all a bunch of jacka**** and you'll fail,' and I helped them succeed. ""Epstein was found dead in his New York City jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. He pleaded guilty and was convicted of procuring a minor for prostitution in 2008.","Tesla CEO Elon Musk and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman recently traded jabs online, accusing each other over their past relationships with Jeffrey Epstein.

In a shocking explosive rant, President Donald Trump wrote a nearly 500-word spiel about regretting hosting comedian Bill Maher at the White House. In the post made on Truth Social on Saturday, he called the host a 'jerk' who has 'zero confidence' during their time together and diagnosed him with the famous Trump Derangement Syndrome.The President revealed that Maher came to the White House for a dinner at the request of a mutual friend and he was surprised by Maher's behaviour which he described as ""extremely nervous, ZERO confidence.""He claimed Maher admitted that he was scared which he found ""somewhat endearing"" and the two had a quick and easy great dinner. However, while the comedian was ""very respectful"" about their meeting for his first show after their dinner, over a period of time, he went to being ""very boring, ANTI TRUMP"" with no credit to the work the President has done to bring the country back from ""OBLIVION"".Trump claimed it was a ""total waste of time for me to have invited this jerk"" to the White House. This was because in a recent episode of his show ""Real Time With Bill Maher"" the host criticised Trump's comments made in a Truth Social post where he claimed that China is plotting to ""terminate ALL ice hockey"" in Canada, in reference to the country's new trade relations with the East Asian tycoon.Maher allegedly criticised Trump's comments saying ""What kind of a person would say such a foolish thing as this,"" which apparently reached the President's ears.""He went on and on about the Hockey statement, like ‘What kind of a person would say such a foolish thing as this,’ as though I were being serious when I said it,"" wrote Trump.However, in his social media rant, Trump claimed Maher's television ratings ""are so low that nobody will learn about his various Fake News statements about me,"" while also putting him in the likes of his other TV show host nemesis including ""Kimmel, Fallon or Colbert.""""Maher asked me if he could come back to the White House again and, with his friend, also asked to come to the wonderful White House Christmas Party, but he didn’t. Regardless, I’d much rather spend my time MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN than wasting it on him.""While calling Maher ""slightly more talented"" than his peers, yet ""highly overrated"" Trump accused him of having a serious case of Trump Derangement Syndrome with there being nothing that can cure him of ""this very serious disease.""""Thank you for your attention to this minor matter.

In an April 11 episode of his show, Maher claimed that everything he had ever not liked about Trump was ""I swear to God, absent, at least on this night with this guy.""He also recently slammed the racist Obama video Trump posted on his Truth Social account, calling the defence of the since-deleted video ""rather lame"" and accusing the White House of being ""hypocrites.""","President Donald Trump wrote a nearly 500-word spiel about regretting hosting comedian Bill Maher at the White House.

Imran Khan’s Family Stages Prayer Protest After Being Barred From Meeting Him At Adiala Jail





The Supreme Court of Pakistan on Thursday directed authorities to constitute a medical board to assess the health of jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan after reports surfaced about a loss of vision in one of his eyes.A bench comprising Chief Justice Yahya Afridi and Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan also instructed officials to facilitate communication between Khan and his two sons, who live in the United Kingdom with his former wife, British producer and screenwriter Jemima Goldsmith.“The issue of Imran’s health is most important. Intervention is necessary. His phone calls with his son are also important,” Chief Justice Afridi said during the hearing.The order came after the bench resumed hearing a case about the jail conditions of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder-president and ordered a detailed medical check-up before February 16. During the hearing, Attorney General Mansoor Usman Awan said it was the state’s responsibility to provide the former prime minister with medical care.The order also came two days after the court asked PTI leader and lawyer Salman Safdar to meet Khan at Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail, where the cricketer-turned-politician has been held since August 5, 2023, following his conviction in a corruption case.Safdar later submitted his report to the court after meeting Khan. It was the first meeting with the jailed leader since December 2, when his sister, Uzma Khan, was allowed to see him for 20 minutes.Meanwhile, Dawn newspaper, citing the report, noted that it detailed Safdar’s meeting with Khan, the condition of his cell, the facilities provided to him, a description of his living area and the process the lawyer followed to reach the jail.In the report, Safdar quoted Khan as stating that despite receiving treatment, including an injection, he has only 15% vision left in his right eye.Khan reportedly told Safdar that until October 2025, he had normal vision in both eyes. He later began experiencing constant blurred and hazy vision, which he repeatedly reported to the then jail superintendent, but no action was taken.The report added that Khan eventually suffered a sudden and complete loss of vision in his right eye. An eye specialist from Pims Hospital, Dr Muhammad Arif, was then called to examine him.He was diagnosed with a blood clot that caused serious damage. Despite treatment, including an injection, his vision in the right eye remains at only 15 per cent.A day earlier, Safdar denied making any statement about Khan’s health on Tuesday, clarifying that anything attributed to him on the matter had been misrepresented or misreported.However, on the day he met Khan, Safdar told reporters that the jailed leader was “fine and healthy.”","The Supreme Court of Pakistan has ordered a medical board to assess the health of Imran Khan.

Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif has delivered a scathing assessment of his country’s past alliances with Washington, telling the National Assembly that Islamabad had been “used like toilet paper and then discarded” after serving American interests in Afghanistan.Speaking during a debate on terrorism following a deadly suicide bombing at a Shia mosque in Islamabad, Asif said Pakistan had repeatedly joined “superpower wars” that were never its own.“We took part in two wars that were fought on the soil of Afghanistan,” Asif told lawmakers. Referring to the Soviet intervention in 1979, he claimed it was carried out “at the invitation of the government in Kabul” and that the narrative of an outright invasion was shaped by the United States.Pakistan, he said, entered those conflicts “in the name of Islam and religion”, but in reality two former military dictators sought legitimacy and the backing of a global power.“These were not our wars; they were superpower wars,” he said, adding that Pakistan and its land were used and then discarded ""like toilet paper.""Asif went on to describe terrorism in Pakistan as the “blowback of mistakes committed by dictators in the past”.He added that Pakistan had failed to learn from history, continuing to shift between Washington, Moscow and London in pursuit of short-term interests.""For our own interests, we sometimes turn to Washington, sometimes to Moscow, and sometimes to Britain. We have built strong franchises here, which was not the case 30 or 40 years ago,"" Asif said.Recalling then US President Bill Clinton’s brief stop in Islamabad in 2000, a visit lasting only a few hours at the end of a longer India trip, Asif said it underscored how transactional the relationship had become. Clinton’s engagement with then military ruler Pervez Musharraf was framed by US demands on democracy, non-proliferation and militancy, reinforcing.Asif’s remarks came as parliament passed a resolution condemning the attack on Imambargah Qasr-e-Khadijatul Kubra in Islamabad’s Tarlai area, where a suicide bomber killed 31 people and wounded 169 during Friday prayers. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility. Thousands attended funerals across the capital as grieving families demanded accountability. “What happened yesterday has left us extremely angry and deeply hurt,” said Bushra Rahmani, whose brother was among the wounded.The minister urged political unity, lamenting what he called a lack of consensus even in condemning terrorism. “It is very important that we have a national identity on which no one disagrees,” he said, criticising those who, for political reasons, avoided attending the funerals of victims.","Defence minister Khawaja Asif criticises Pakistan's past alliances with the U.S. and Russia.

‘China no longer trusts us’

Backdrop of deadly Islamabad attack





Pakistan’s Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman on Sunday launched a sharp attack on Pakistan’s handling of militancy and its Afghanistan policy, questioning how extremist elements continue to cross the border even as trade remains blocked.Speaking at a public gathering in Rawalpindi, Rehman highlighted what he described as a glaring contradiction in Islamabad’s approach towards Afghanistan. “In all these decades, we never paused to ask why our Afghan policy failed so miserably. Not a single pomegranate or melon can enter Pakistan, yet terrorists keep crossing the border,” he said, smiling as he made the remark.Referring to repeated claims by Pakistani authorities that militants were entering from Afghanistan, Rehman added, “Authorities say terrorists are coming from there. If they are coming, stop them. If they are coming, eliminate them. The Afghan government has never objected to your actions.”The JUI-F leader also criticised Pakistan’s broader foreign and economic policies, calling them “complete failures”. He said Islamabad’s diplomatic approach had left the country increasingly isolated.“India is our enemy, Afghanistan is our enemy, and even Iran and China are upset with us,” Rehman said, adding that the public deserved answers.“A nation cannot survive when its policies produce only isolation, mistrust and insecurity.”He argued that Pakistan’s foreign policy was being driven not by elected governments but by the military establishment. “One general comes and says we will negotiate; another comes and says we will wage war,” he said.Rehman also took aim at the government’s handling of the China-Pakistan economic corridor (CPEC), claiming that the flagship infrastructure project had stalled due to declining Chinese confidence.“CPEC has seen no real progress during this tenure because China no longer trusts us,” he said, questioning whether “even a single brick” had moved under the current government. He claimed Beijing had expected the Pakistan democratic movement (PDM) government to stabilise relations and revive projects, but remained dissatisfied.Rehman’s remarks come amid heightened tensions following a suicide bombing at a mosque in Islamabad on Friday that killed 69 people and injured more than 170, according to local media reports citing hospital officials. The blast occurred during Friday prayers at Imambargah Qasr-i-Khadijatul Kubra in the Tarlai area, Dawn reported.After Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif suggested on X that preliminary findings pointed to the attacker having travelled to and from Afghanistan, Kabul rejected the allegation. Afghanistan’s ministry of national defence termed the claim “irresponsible and baseless” and urged Pakistani authorities to take responsibility for internal security lapses, Afghan media outlet Ariana News reported.The Afghan ministry said similar accusations had been made in the past following attacks in Balochistan and other parts of Pakistan, without conclusive evidence.","Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman criticises Pakistan’s handling of militancy and its Afghanistan policy.

'Not Vassals Of Trump & Elon Musk': Spain's Deputy PM Makes Blistering Exit From 'Place Of Hate' X





Pakistan’s decision on granting a licence to Starlink to operate in its satellite internet market has been delayed amid data security concerns, geopolitical sensitivities and competition from Chinese firms, local media reported on Sunday.Starlink, owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk , is among five companies seeking approval to provide satellite-based internet services in Pakistan. However, officials say unresolved security considerations and broader geopolitical factors have slowed the clearance process.According to the Express Tribune, the government has raised concerns that Starlink’s services could allow certain data transmissions to bypass Pakistan’s monitoring, regulatory and safety checks. “We cannot allow a license to Starlink without ensuring a safety check to ensure the safety of the data of consumers in Pakistan,” a senior government official was quoted as saying by Express Tribune.Sources cited by the newspaper said authorities had tested scenarios in which Starlink was expected to pick up sensitive data while providing satellite-based internet services. “But the real reason is that the government has tested some cases in which Starlink was supposed to pick up some sensitive data while providing satellite-based internet services,” sources said.Officials added that the government is working to address these issues, which have delayed the approval process.The report also cited the fallout between US President Donald Trump and Elon Musk as a factor being weighed by the Pakistani establishment. While Trump and Musk had enjoyed a close relationship in the past, they later drifted apart. Officials indicated that Pakistan, which has seen improved ties with the United States since Trump returned to power last year, is cautious about taking steps that could draw scrutiny from Washington.At present, Pakistan maintains control over internet data traffic largely through Pakistan Telecommunication Company Limited, which holds a majority stake in the country’s undersea cable infrastructure. Authorities are concerned that similar oversight may not be feasible with satellite-based services, raising fears of potential data breaches or loss of regulatory control.Satellite internet services are expected to focus primarily on remote and underserved regions, including Balochistan, where conventional broadband infrastructure remains limited. Currently, authorities are able to monitor internet traffic and suspend connectivity when required for security reasons. Officials have expressed concern that enforcing similar controls over satellite-based networks could prove more challenging.The Pakistan Space Activities Regulatory Board has confirmed that five companies, including Starlink and China-based Shanghai Spacecom Satellite Technology Limited, have shown interest in entering the satellite internet market. Chinese firms already have a strong presence in Pakistan’s telecommunications sector and are viewed as direct competitors to US-based companies such as Starlink.While consultations with stakeholders have been completed, the PSARB has yet to finalise the licensing framework. According to officials, additional time is needed to establish safety mechanisms before satellite-based internet services are permitted to begin operations.","Starlink, owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk, is among five companies seeking approval to provide satellite-based internet services in Pakistan.

NEW DELHI: Global terror outfit Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the deadly blast at a Shia mosque in Islamabad that led to over three dozen casualties on Friday.

Amaq claimed over 200 casualties in contrast to the official Pak govt admission of 36 deaths and injuries to scores.The suicide bomber was identified by Amaq as Saifullah Ansari. His photograph taking the bayah (oath of allegiance) was also posted by the IS mouthpiece. The statement also mentioned that hundreds of Pakistani Shias had joined the pro-Iran 'Zaynabiyoun brigade' militia in Syria.The claim by Amaq followed an official denial by Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which strongly rebutted any involvement in the incident.The blast, which occurred during prayers at the Khadijatul Kubra mosque in Tarlai area, was the deadliest in Islamabad since the 2008 Marriott hotel bombing.The explosion coincided with the visit of Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev to Pakistan.

'Home-Grown Ills': Islamabad Mosque Blast Triggers Blame Game As India Rejects Pakistan's Blame





The Islamic State on Saturday claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing at a Shiite mosque in Islamabad, which killed at least 36 people and injured many others.In a statement released through its Amaq News Agency, the Islamic State in Pakistan, an offshoot of Daesh, said the bomber opened fire at security guards when they tried to stop him at the entrance and then exploded inside among worshippers.The group also said Shiite Muslims in Pakistan were a target, claiming they provided recruits to militias fighting the Islamic State in Syria.The blast took place on Friday at the Khadijatul Kubra mosque-cum-shrine in the Tarlie area of the capital. The attacker, identified as 32-year-old Yasir from Peshawar, entered the mosque while worshippers were offering weekly prayers and detonated explosives.Authorities in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province said they arrested four suspects, including three alleged facilitators and the mastermind, during intelligence-based raids in Peshawar and Nowshera.Investigators said an identity card recovered during the probe confirmed the attacker’s identity. Official records showed his permanent address in Abbas Colony on Charsadda Road in Peshawar.Officials also said the attacker had spent around five months in Afghanistan before the bombing, where he allegedly received training in weapons handling and suicide attacks.Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif had earlier claimed that India and Afghanistan were involved in the attack, without presenting any evidence.India had strongly rejected the allegations, saying, ""It is unfortunate that, instead of seriously addressing the problems plaguing its social fabric, Pakistan should choose to delude itself by blaming others for its home-grown ills.

Pakistan has been invited to participate in upcoming talks between Iran and the United States aimed at easing tensions between the two countries, slated to take place on Friday in Turkey.“Pakistan has received the invitation for the upcoming talks between Iran and the United States,” Pakistan foreign office spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said while responding to a query, reported Dawn.Pakistan's deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar is expected to take part in the meeting, the daily reported citing a diplomatic source, adding that “Islamabad’s participation was seen as significant.”An Arab official told AFP on condition of anonymity that the meeting is likely to be held in Turkiye on Friday. The format of the talks remains unclear, though the official said the main meeting would take place that day.A regional official told Reuters that the priority of the talks was to avoid conflict and de-escalate tensions between Iran and the US, adding that several regional powers had been invited at the foreign ministers’ level.According to the official, countries invited include Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Egypt, Oman and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).US outlet Axios, citing two sources and a US official, reported that Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi was expected to meet US envoy Steve Witkoff in Istanbul to discuss a possible agreement related to Iran’s nuclear programme.Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian confirmed on Tuesday that he had instructed Araghchi to pursue “fair and equitable negotiations” in an environment “free from threats and unreasonable expectations”.The talks, he said in posts on X, would be held “within the framework of our national interests”.US President Donald Trump has said he is hopeful Washington would “work something out” with Iran but warned on Monday that “bad things would happen” if no deal was reached.In an interview with CNN on Sunday, Araghchi said: “President Trump said no nuclear weapons, and we fully agree. We fully agree with that. That could be a very good deal.”“In return, we expect sanctions to be lifted,” he added, while warning that Iran was prepared for war if talks failed, saying any conflict would likely spread beyond Iran.Turkiye has been leading diplomatic efforts to defuse tensions, with Araghchi visiting Istanbul last week and engaging with regional counterparts, including in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan.Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia and the UAE have assured Tehran that they would not allow their airspace or territory to be used for military action against Iran, while Jordan has said it would not act as a “launching pad” for any such action.","Pakistan has been invited to participate in upcoming talks between Iran and the United States.

Aleema’s application seeking exemption from personal appearance was rejected.The case, registered at Sadiqabad Police Station, relates to a protest at D-Chowk in Islamabad on November 24, 2024 and includes charges of protesting against the government, chanting anti-government slogans, vandalism and stone-pelting. ATC Judge Amjad Ali Shah conducted the hearing.The court also issued a show-cause notice to the Superintendent of Police (SP), Rawal, for failing to execute the arrest warrants.The SP has been directed to appear before the court on Wednesday and explain why Aleema Khan was not arrested and presented despite clear orders, according to Pakistani news website Express Tribune.During Monday’s hearing, Aleema Khan’s defence counsel sought a one-day exemption, citing difficulties in travel and daily affairs after her bank accounts, Computerised National Identity Card and passport were reportedly blocked. The court, however, did not accept the plea.The proceedings have drawn attention as Aleema Khan had earlier skipped multiple hearings in the case and appeared only after the court issued property seizure orders and several arrest warrants. She is among those nominated as accused in protest-related cases filed following the November demonstrations.The protest followed Imran Khan’s “final call” for nationwide demonstrations demanding the restoration of the party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) electoral mandate, the release of party leaders and the reversal of constitutional changes.The D-Chowk protest ended on November 26 after a security operation, with several cases registered across Rawalpindi district. In total, 29 cases linked to the protest have been filed in the district, with Imran Khan named in several and his wife, Bushra Bibi, charged in all 29 cases.","Pakistani anti-terrorism court issues non-bailable arrest warrants against Aleema Khan.

'Physically handicapped': Khawaja Asif's brutal admission as Pakistan forces battle BLA,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/physically-handicapped-khawaja-asifs-brutal-admission-as-pakistan-forces-battling-bla-in-balochistan/articleshow/127880579.cms,"Balochistan Crisis: Pakistan-Origin Commentator Takes Apart Islamabad, Exposes Lies On India

Troops ‘physically handicapped’ by vast terrain

Insurgency background and wider fallout





Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif said the country’s security forces are “physically handicapped” by the sheer size of Balochistan as they battle a fresh surge in militant violence, after authorities reported killing 177 insurgents in sweeping counter-terror operations across the province.Addressing the national assembly, Asif described the scale of the challenge facing troops deployed in Pakistan’s largest and least populated province, where coordinated attacks triggered one of the deadliest security crises in recent years. His remarks came after militants launched simultaneous assaults in multiple towns, targeting civilians, homes and security installations.“Balochistan constitutes over 40 per cent of Pakistan geographically...To control it is much more difficult than a populated city, and it needs deployment of massive forces. Our troops are deployed there and are in action against them (terrorists), but they are physically handicapped by guarding and patrolling such a big area,” Asif told lawmakers, as quoted by PTI.Security officials said the death toll of militants had risen to 177 in the past two days following large-scale raids and gun battles.The operations were launched after insurgents carried out coordinated attacks at 12 locations, with authorities confirming that at least 17 police and security personnel were killed, along with dozens of civilians.Asif said the weekend violence claimed 33 civilian lives and 17 members of the security forces. He ruled out talks with the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), saying no negotiations would be held with “terrorists” responsible for killing civilians, including women and children.Balochistan, which borders Iran and Afghanistan, has long faced a separatist insurgency driven by ethnic Baloch groups who accuse the central government of discrimination and exploitation. Authorities say groups such as the BLA have targeted security forces, infrastructure and projects linked to the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor.Train services between Balochistan and the rest of Pakistan remained suspended for a third day, while mobile and internet services were cut in several districts during clean-up operations. Provincial officials said services were expected to resume once the security situation stabilised.Asif dismissed claims that Balochistan had been neglected, saying the province had seen development, including multiple airports. He also rejected the “missing persons” narrative, alleging that names of militants killed in operations had appeared on such lists. “This narrative has been concocted. I also used to support this cause and protest over it. But, terrorists and criminal elements have hijacked all these narratives,” he said.","Khawaja Asif says security forces are 'physically handicapped' by sheer size of Balochistan.

Dhaka: Amid preparations by Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) to form the next govt, Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami on Saturday called for a recount in 30 constituencies for the 13th parliamentary election, alleging irregularities in the vote-counting process.Speaking at a press conference, Jamaat leaders said a recount could significantly alter the outcomes at several of the 30 seats. Jamaat assistant secretary general and head of its central publicity department Ehsanul Mahbub Zubayer urged the authorities to suspend the swearing-in of declared winners in the disputed constituencies until the recount process is completed.He alleged that the results were ""deliberately altered to defeat the candidates of Jamaat and the 11-party alliance,"" claiming that certain officials in the administration and Election Commission were complicit in the poll irregularities. The party, he said, is pursuing legal remedies over the matter.","Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami calls for a recount in 30 constituencies for the 13th parliamentary election.

Newly elected members of Bangladesh parliament are set to take oath on February 17, Dhaka Tribune reported on Saturday. The cabinet members are scheduled to be sworn in later the same day, the the report said, citing Election Commission secretary Akhtar Ahmed.The 13th parliamentary election took place on February 12, with polling conducted in 299 of the country’s 300 constituencies. The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) emerged dominant, securing 209 seats, while Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami won 68. The National Citizens Party (NCP), a member of the 11-party alliance, captured six seats, and Bangladesh Khelafat Majlis, contesting under the same coalition, won two.Earlier, in his first address to the nation post victory in polls, BNP chief Tarique Rahman talked about ""Bangladesh First"" policy when it comes to the foreign relations with its neighbours.""We have cleared ourselves regarding the foreign policy which is in the interest of Bangladesh, and the interest of the Bangladeshi people comes first. By protecting the interest of Bangladesh and the Bangladeshi people, we will decide our foreign policy,"" he said.He also said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi should be invited for the swearing-in.His return to Bangladesh signals a major realignment in Dhaka’s political landscape. After spending 17 years in exile, the 60-year-old leader is set to assume the prime minister’s office following the BNP’s sweeping electoral victory.His ascent is likely to reshape India-Bangladesh ties, which had strengthened during Sheikh Hasina’s rule but experienced friction after her removal. Rahman has indicated a practical, measured stance toward New Delhi, underscoring the need for “mutual respect and understanding” in bilateral engagement.Several core issues are expected to define the next phase of relations: border management, allegations of illegal migration and insurgent activity across frontiers; the sharing of transboundary river waters, particularly the Teesta and Padma; the safety of Hindus and other minorities amid recent incidents; and economic cooperation, including prospects for expanded trade and investment.","The 13th parliamentary election took place on February 12, with polling conducted in 299 of the country’s 300 constituencies.

A senior leader of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party on Saturday said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi should be invited to Dhaka as BNP chief Tarique Rahman prepares to assume office as Bangladesh’s next Prime Minister following the party’s landslide victory in the general elections.BNP leader ANM Ehsanul Hoque Milan expressed hope that South Asian leaders, including PM Modi, would be invited to the swearing-in ceremony. Speaking to reporters in Dhaka after the party’s victory, he said, ""I don't know exactly what they're doing, but hopefully they'll invite everyone. I don't know exactly, but he (PM Modi) should be invited. It's general courtesy. The organisers will do it. I hope the whole world will be with us. ""Highlighting the party’s broader foreign policy approach, Milan added, ""friends to all, malice to none.""His remarks come as the BNP prepares to form the next government after securing a decisive mandate in the 13th national parliament elections held on February 12. The result marks the party’s return to power after nearly two decades, with Tarique Rahman set to take office as Prime Minister, in line with the party’s earlier announcement.According to the Election Commission, results for 297 seats have been declared so far. BNP candidates have won 209 seats, while the party is also leading in two constituencies where results are currently suspended.BNP allies have secured three additional seats, taking the BNP-led alliance’s total to 212 seats. In comparison, Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami has won 68 seats, while its allies in the 11-party alliance have secured nine more, bringing their total to 77 seats. The Election Commission has already issued the official gazette notification for the elected Members of Parliament, according to Prothom Alo.Preparations for the formation of the new government are now under way. The new cabinet is expected to be sworn in within the next three to four days, with the Cabinet Division completing all necessary arrangements.The oath-taking ceremony will be held at Bangabhaban and administered by President Mohammed Shahabuddin, as per constitutional provisions.Cabinet secretary Sheikh Abdur Rashid said, ""We hope the oath-taking ceremony will be held within the next three days, or at most four days."" He added that preparations were complete and the ceremony could be held even sooner if required.Officials said arrangements have been made to host around 1,000 guests at the ceremony.The developments come amid warm diplomatic outreach from New Delhi.

A mandate with strategic implications





Bangladesh’s 13th national parliamentary elections have handed the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) a commanding mandate, marking a decisive political shift after months of turbulence.But beyond the scale of victory, the outcome has drawn attention for another reason, the return of several controversial leaders whose past convictions, later acquittals and anti-India links are likely to shape regional calculations.The polls, which saw BNP chief Tarique Rahman secure a two-thirds majority, were widely viewed as a reset following the mass uprising that led to the ouster of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina.The BNP-led alliance won 212 seats, securing more than a two-thirds majority in Parliament, while the Jamaat-e-Islami-led alliance won 77 seats. Hasina’s Awami League was barred from contesting the elections.Hasina fled to India in 2024 amid the unrest, after which Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus headed an interim administration. Since her departure, relations between Dhaka and New Delhi have remained strained.While Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated Rahman on his party’s “decisive victory” and expressed hope of strengthening ties, the electoral success of figures such as Lutfozzaman Babar, Abdus Salam Pintu, ATM Azharul Islam and Hasnat Abdullah adds a more complex layer to India-Bangladesh engagement.Former state minister for home affairs Lutfozzaman Babar, contesting on a BNP ticket, secured a sweeping win in the Netrokona-4 (Madan–Mohanganj–Khaliajuri) constituency..Babar received 160,351 votes, defeating Jamaat-e-Islami candidate Al Helal Talukder, who polled 39,309 votes, a margin of 121,042 votes. He was unofficially declared elected.“This victory is the victory of the people. I will continue to work for the development of the area, strengthening infrastructure, and fulfilling the expectations of the people,” Babar said, thanking voters for a peaceful poll, according to Dhaka Tribune.His return marks a dramatic reversal of fortune. In 2014, a special tribunal sentenced him to death in the 10-truck arms haul case, one of the largest arms smuggling cases in Bangladesh’s history.The case stemmed from the seizure of 10 truckloads of weapons at the Chittagong Urea Fertiliser Limited jetty on April 1, 2004.Investigators had believed the consignment was intended for the Indian separatist group ULFA.However, in 2024, the Bangladesh high court acquitted Babar and several others in the case, overturning the earlier death sentences.The sentences of others, including ULFA chief Paresh Baruah, were reduced. Former Jamaat chief Motiur Rahman Nizami, also convicted in the case, was executed in 2016.Former BNP vice-chairman Abdus Salam Pintu has also returned to Parliament after securing 1,98,867 votes in Tangail-2, the highest tally in the district, reported The Daily Star.He defeated his Jamaat rival by a margin of 1.38 lakh votes. His younger brother, Sultan Salahuddin Tuku, won from Tangail-5.Pintu’s political comeback follows nearly 17 years behind bars. He was arrested in 2008 in connection with the 2004 grenade attack on an Awami League rally that killed 24 people and injured more than 300. In 2018, a trial court sentenced him and 18 others to death.In December 2024, he was released from prison after the high court acquitted him.However, his name has also surfaced in connection with alleged anti-India activities. Pintu was accused of aiding the Pakistan-based militant group Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami (HuJI) in carrying out attacks against India.He was also accused of funding extremist elements operating from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and Bangladesh. There was, however, no official confirmation of these specific allegations.The grenade attack case itself is regarded as one of the most heinous political crimes in Bangladesh’s history. Despite the acquittal, Pintu’s past continues to attract scrutiny, particularly in the context of India-Bangladesh security cooperation.Following his electoral win, Pintu and his brother pledged to work for the welfare of the people.Jamaat-e-Islami leader ATM Azharul Islam won the Rangpur-2 seat with 135,556 votes, defeating BNP candidate Mohammad Ali Sarkar, who secured 80,538 votes.Azharul had been sentenced to death in 2014 after being convicted by the International Crimes Tribunal for crimes against humanity during the 1971 Liberation War, including charges of rape, murder and genocide.In 2025, Bangladesh’s Supreme Court overturned his conviction, terming the earlier judgment flawed. He was released after more than a decade in custody.His acquittal triggered polarised reactions. Jamaat supporters welcomed the ruling, while student groups at Dhaka University and Rajshahi University staged protests, accusing the interim administration of “rewriting history”. Clashes were reported between rival student groups following the verdict.Azharul had been a senior Jamaat leader at a time when the party opposed Bangladesh’s independence in 1971, a deeply sensitive chapter in the nation’s history that continues to shape political narratives.In Cumilla-4, National Citizen Party (NCP) candidate Md Abul Hasnat, widely known as Hasnat Abdullah, won with 1,66,583 votes, defeating his nearest rival, who secured 49,885 votes.Hasnat has drawn attention in India for his sharp rhetoric. In late 2025, he warned that India’s northeastern states could be “isolated” and suggested offering refuge to separatist groups if Bangladesh were destabilised.He described India’s northeast as geographically “vulnerable” due to its reliance on the narrow Siliguri Corridor, often referred to as the “Chicken’s Neck”.His remarks came at a time of heightened tensions following the killing and subsequent death of student activist Sharif Osman Hadi, whose death sparked large protests in Dhaka.Prior to the attack on him, Hadi had shared a controversial map related to India on social media, which drew criticism. In the aftermath of his death, anti-India slogans were heard during some protests and sections of public discourse increasingly reflected nationalist sentimentAmid these developments and reported threats near the Indian High Commission in Dhaka, India summoned Bangladesh’s High Commissioner Riaz Hamidullah, conveying “strong concerns” over the deteriorating security situation and the activities of certain extremist elements around the mission.In a recent video, he was seen calling for a ban on ISKCON and saying that Chinmoy Krishna Das, a Bangladeshi Hindu monk, should be hanged.Abdullah’s rise indicates the growing political space occupied by figures who adopt overtly nationalist or anti-India positions, a development closely watched in New Delhi.In addition to the electoral success of these leaders, the return of the BNP to power has also revived Dhaka’s demand for the extradition of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina from India, creating an early diplomatic challenge for New Delhi.Soon after the party’s landslide win, senior BNP leader Salahuddin Ahmed made it clear that the new government would pursue her return. “The foreign minister has already placed the case for her extradition, and we also support it,” he said, adding that the matter should be handled “according to the law” between the foreign ministries of both countries.Hasina has been in New Delhi since August 2024 after being removed from office during a mass uprising. In November 2025, a special tribunal in Bangladesh sentenced her to death in absentia for crimes against humanity linked to the violent crackdown on protesters during the 2024 unrest.She is also facing multiple other cases filed by the interim administration.India has confirmed that Dhaka sent an official request for her extradition, including a note verbale and a formal letter. The MEA has said the request is being “examined”.External affairs minister S Jaishankar earlier stated that Hasina’s stay in India was her personal decision following developments in Bangladesh.Hasina, however, has rejected the charges, calling them politically motivated. She has said she was not given a fair opportunity to defend herself and claimed she was denied lawyers of her own choice during the trial in absentia.She has also expressed willingness to face proceedings in what she described as a neutral and fair international forum.In its election manifesto, unveiled by Tarique Rahman, the BNP outlined a firmer foreign policy approach under the slogan “Friend Yes, Master No” and a doctrine described as “Bangladesh Before All”.While India was not explicitly mentioned, the document emphasised taking a stricter stand on issues such as alleged “border killings”, “push-ins”, smuggling, and securing Bangladesh’s fair share of water from shared rivers including the Teesta and the Padma.Senior BNP leader Salahuddin Ahmed said Dhaka sought normal relations with all neighbours, including India, but on the basis of equality and mutual respect.Rahman reinforced that message in his first public address after the results were declared. He said Bangladesh’s foreign policy would be guided by the principle that “people come first”, stressing that national interest would determine the country’s external engagement, including with New Delhi.“The interests of Bangladesh and its people comes first and it will determine our foreign policy,” Rahman said.Calling for unity after the decisive mandate, he described the victory as belonging to “freedom loving pro-democracy people” and urged political forces to work together despite differences.Even as Rahman adopted a measured tone, his adviser Humayun Kabir made pointed remarks about regional radicalisation. In an interview with news agency PTI, Kabir said extremism was a broader South Asian challenge, referring to “Hindu extremism and far-right intolerance” in India and extremist elements in Pakistan.He added that Bangladesh would pursue balanced relations and would not limit its partnerships to any single country, an apparent reference to criticism that the previous administration was overly aligned with New Delhi.Soon after the results were announced, Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated Rahman and reaffirmed India’s commitment to a “democratic, progressive and inclusive Bangladesh”.The two leaders also spoke over the phone, signalling an intent to maintain engagement despite policy differences.With the BNP holding a strong mandate and Hasina remaining in India, the extradition question is likely to become one of the first major tests of how the two sides recalibrate ties after Bangladesh’s political shift.The BNP’s emphatic victory may restore electoral legitimacy after a turbulent political chapter. However, the composition of the new Parliament introduces uncertainty about the direction of policy.The return of leaders once sentenced in major criminal cases, alongside figures associated with hardline rhetoric on India, complicates the diplomatic landscape at a sensitive moment in bilateral ties.The renewed push for Sheikh Hasina’s extradition adds further pressure to an already delicate equation.For India, which, under Hasina, developed close security coordination and counter-insurgency cooperation with Dhaka, the transition will require careful diplomatic calibration.Issues such as border management, cross-border militancy, water sharing and minority safety are likely to resurface more prominently in the coming months.Whether the BNP’s mandate translates into substantive policy shifts or remains anchored in domestic political positioning will determine the trajectory of India-Bangladesh relations.What is clear is that the political reset in Dhaka has introduced new variables into a relationship that both sides describe as strategically important.","Bangladesh's 13th national parliamentary elections have handed the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) a commanding mandate. The polls were widely viewed as a reset following the mass uprising that led to the ouster of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina. The electoral success of figures such as Lutfozzaman Babar, Abdus Salam Pintu, ATM Azharul Islam and Hasnat Abdullah is likely to shape regional calculations.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128350742,imgsize-1113838,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-2026-02-14t195044.jpg"

What the BNP’s victory means for India





Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) chief Tarique Rahman on Saturday said that Dhaka’s foreign policy would be guided by the principle that “people come first,” including in its ties with India.In his first address after the party’s sweeping electoral victory, Rahman said that the country’s national interest would remain the central focus of his government’s external engagement.Responding to a question on relations with New Delhi, Rahman said: “The interests of Bangladesh and its people comes first and it will determine our foreign policy,” he said.Rahman also used his first address to call for national unity following the decisive mandate. The BNP secured more than a two-thirds majority in the parliamentary elections, the first since the 2024 uprising that led to the ouster of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina.According to the Election Commission, the BNP-led alliance won 212 seats, while the Jamaat-e-Islami-led alliance secured 77 seats. Hasina’s Bangladesh Awami League was barred from contesting the polls.In his speech, Rahman dedicated the victory to those who, he said, had sacrificed for democracy.“Freedom loving pro-democracy people of the country have once again brought victory to the Bangladesh Nationalist Party,” he said.“This victory belongs to Bangladesh, belongs to democracy, this victory belongs to people who aspired to and have sacrificed for democracy,” he added.He urged political forces to work together despite differences. “Our paths and opinions may differ, but in the interest of the country, we must remain united,” Rahman said.Even as Rahman adopted a measured tone on foreign policy, his adviser Humayun Kabir made pointed remarks about radicalisation in the region.In an interview with PTI, Kabir said, “Radicalisation is a problem in South Asia. We see Hindu extremism and far-right intolerance growing in Indian society, and in Pakistan, we also hear of extremist elements. In Bangladesh, it is not at that level, but there are some issues.”He called for stronger regional cooperation and information sharing to counter extremism and said a BNP government would seek “balanced relations” with all countries, including India.“What we want are balanced relations. We will not limit our relationships to a single country,” Kabir said, referring to criticism that the previous government was overly aligned with New Delhi.Soon after the results were declared, Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated Rahman on his party’s victory and reaffirmed India’s commitment to strong bilateral ties.In a post on X, PM Modi wrote: “I convey my warm congratulations to Mr Tarique Rahman on leading BNP to a decisive victory in the Parliamentary elections in Bangladesh. This victory shows the trust of the people of Bangladesh in your leadership.” He added, “I look forward to working with you to strengthen our multifaceted relations and advance our common development goals.”PM Modi also spoke with Rahman and reaffirmed India’s commitment to close bilateral ties. In a post on X, PM said, “Delighted to speak with Mr. Tarique Rahman. I congratulated him on the remarkable victory in the Bangladesh elections.”He added, “I conveyed my best wishes and support in his endeavour to fulfil the aspirations of the people of Bangladesh.”The BNP, in turn, thanked India for recognising the electoral verdict and expressed hope that relations would strengthen under the new government.Rahman’s return marks a significant political shift in Dhaka. The 60-year-old leader returned to Bangladesh in December after 17 years in exile in Britain. He is the son of former president Ziaur Rahman and former prime minister Khaleda Zia.Under Sheikh Hasina’s tenure, India and Bangladesh developed close strategic and security ties. However, relations saw strains after her ouster.The BNP’s earlier terms in office were marked by periodic friction with India, particularly during its 2001–06 coalition with Jamaat-e-Islami, when New Delhi raised concerns about insurgent groups allegedly operating from Bangladeshi territory. In contrast, India viewed Hasina as a dependable partner on security cooperation.Despite that history, Rahman has recently signalled a pragmatic approach. In previous remarks, he has emphasised “mutual respect and mutual understanding” in ties with India.Several sensitive issues are expected to shape the next phase of bilateral relations — including border security, alleged illegal migration, water-sharing of transboundary rivers such as the Teesta, and the safety of minorities.The safety of the Hindu community, in particular, remains a closely watched issue. Just days before the elections, a 62-year-old Hindu trader, Susen Chandra Sarkar, was hacked to death in Mymensingh district. Authorities have said investigations are ongoing. India has previously expressed concern over attacks on minorities in Bangladesh, calling them a matter of grave concern.","BNP secured more than a two-thirds majority in the parliamentary elections, the first since the 2024 uprising that led to the ouster of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina.

BNP's Tarique Rahman Set To Become Bangladesh PM After Sweeping Victory In Historic Comeback





Bangladesh Nationalist Party chairman Tarique Rahman’s adviser Humayun Kabir on Saturday said that ""Hindu extremism and far-right intolerance"" are growing in India, describing radicalisation as a wider South Asian concern.He also called for balanced and cooperative ties with New Delhi as the BNP prepares to form the next government following its sweeping electoral victory.In an interview with PTI, Kabir said, “Radicalisation is a problem in South Asia. We see Hindu extremism and far-right intolerance growing in Indian society, and in Pakistan, we also hear of extremist elements. In Bangladesh, it is not at that level, but there are some issues,” he said.He emphasised that regional governments must work together instead of functioning in isolation.“That is why all of us need to share counter-terrorism evidence and assessments and strengthen cooperation. Sitting in isolation and not engaging in information exchange or security cooperation only hinders progress,” Kabir said.“It is important to have cooperation at all levels, which is the norm of diplomacy, especially between elected governments in our region.Going forward, information sharing and working together will build confidence in detecting and tracking terrorists and extremists in the region,” he added.Kabir also responded to questions about India’s concerns regarding the safety of minorities, especially Hindus in Bangladesh.Referring to the previous government led by Sheikh Hasina, he said, “For the last 15 years under the Hasina regime, there have been deep and disturbing concerns that the foreign policy was more aligned with India’s foreign policy rather than Bangladesh’s. These concerns will continue to exist.”He said that the BNP would pursue what he described as a more balanced foreign policy.“What we want are balanced relations. We will not limit our relationships to a single country, and we will not accept any agreements that prevent us from doing business with others. We will avoid such agreements and disclosures,” he said.On allegations of minority violence, Kabir maintained that communal harmony prevails in Bangladesh.“The minority violence seen in India does not exist in the same form in Bangladesh, where communal harmony prevails,” he said.Providing context on the political transition, he added, “After the 5th August uprising, Bangladesh was without a government for five days, yet no one attacked minorities, as our leader, Tarique Rahman, urged people to remain calm and not take the law into their own hands.”“He provided calm leadership to ensure stability until the interim government was formed. In Bangladesh, Muslims and minorities live together peacefully, and communal harmony is strong,” Kabir said.The remarks come as the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) secured a sweeping victory with more than two-thirds majority in the parliamentary elections held after the 2024 uprising that led to the ouster of Sheikh Hasina.The issue of minority safety has been under renewed focus following recent incidents of violence. Just days before the parliamentary elections, a 62-year-old Hindu trader, Susen Chandra Sarkar was hacked to death inside his shop in Mymensingh district. Police said unidentified assailants attacked him with a sharp weapon and later fled the scene.","Bangladesh Nationalist Party chairman Tarique Rahman’s adviser Humayun Kabir on Saturday said that ""Hindu extremism and far-right intolerance"" are growing in India. He also called for balanced and cooperative ties with New Delhi as the BNP prepares to form the next government.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128342776,imgsize-679204,width-400,resizemode-4/128342776.jpg"
Jamaat wins in Bangla border areas spark worries,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/jamaat-wins-in-bangla-border-areas-spark-worries/articleshow/128334768.cms,"BNP Demands Sheikh Hasina's Extradition From India After Bangladesh Poll Win





Concerns have deepened after Friday’s Bangladesh poll results showed hardliner Jamaat-e-Islami and its allies winning many of their 68 seats in areas bordering India. The total tally is Jamaat’s highest in over 25 years.Jamaat’s historical and ideological proximity with Pakistan raises the risks for India, a peril flagged by BJP. The saffron party had bagged in 2021 more than 16 Bengal assembly constituencies that share borders with the areas of Bangladesh where Jamaat has made inroads. “Bangladesh is a different country. We expect the newly formed govt to maintain law and order and ensure minorities will not be persecuted. But Jamaat’s victory along the border is worrying. It clearly shows there has been strong radicalisation on both sides of the border,” Union minister Sukanta Majumdar of BJP said.South 24 Parganas, North 24 Parganas, Nadia, Murshidabad, Malda and Alipurduar are among the Bengal districts that share borders with Bangladesh zones where Jamaat has come up trumps. Broadly, Jamaat has put its footprint on much of western Bangladesh, including Satkhira, Mymensingh, Rajshahi, Rangpur and Gaibandha.Functionaries of exiled former PM Sheikh Hasina’s Awami League indicated that Jamaat, banned earlier, started spreading its influence over the past year. “Jamaat is a radical outfit which believes in hardlines which was never acceptable to democratic parties like Awami League. Unfortunately, they spread their organisation during the tenure of the interim govt,” said Salim Mahmud, former Awami League MP of Chandpur (1).In the 2001 election, Jamaat won 17 seats. In 2008, it was reduced to two. In 2013, Jamaat’s registration was cancelled by Bangladesh’s Supreme Court. While Hasina banned Jamaat, the interim govt lifted it in 2024.",Jamaat-e-Islami and its allies won many of their 68 seats in areas bordering India.

"‘Lucky to be alive’: British woman survives 30ft plunge at Wales waterfall, demands stricter safety measures",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/lucky-to-be-alive-british-woman-survives-30ft-plunge-at-wales-waterfall-demands-stricter-safety-measures/articleshow/128358469.cms,"Rescue effort took four hours

Dispute over warning signs

Rising safety concerns





A 50-year-old British woman has said she feels “lucky to be alive” after plunging nearly 30 feet off a narrow, eroded path at a popular waterfall trail in Wales, an area that has seen multiple fatalities in recent years.She is now urging authorities to introduce stronger safety measures to prevent further tragedies. Suzie Dyer, a gardener from Hereford and mother of one, was hiking with a friend along the scenic Four Waterfalls Walk in Waterfall Country, located in Bannau Brycheiniog, also widely known as the Brecon Beacons, on New Year’s Day when the accident occurred.The circular trail passes several well-known waterfalls, including Sgwd Clun-Gwyn, Sgwd Isaf Clun-Gwyn, Sgwd y Pannwr and Sgwd yr Eira.According to Dyer, after visiting the first waterfall on the route, she proceeded onto what appeared to be a continuation of the path. “It was narrow and badly eroded,” she said. “The next minute, I was over the edge. My friend was shouting and screaming, it was horrific.”She fell into a gorge below, sustaining severe injuries to her hip, pelvis and back.Her husband later revealed that she also shattered her elbow, with the bone protruding, and required multiple surgeries, including reconstructive arm surgery, pelvic repairs and spinal treatment.She was reportedly hypothermic on arrival at hospital.Three fellow hikers rushed to help her before members of the Central Beacons Mountain Rescue Team and emergency services arrived. The complex rescue operation lasted four hours before she was stabilised and airlifted to hospital.Recalling the ordeal, Dyer said, “When I was lying there, all I could think was, ‘I’m not ready to leave my daughter.’ I don’t think anyone thought I would survive, but I did for some reason.”The area is jointly managed by Natural Resources Wales (NRW), the Bannau Brycheiniog National Park Authority and local councils. NRW stated that the fall likely occurred on a Public Right of Way that is not part of the official waymarked Four Falls Trail and insisted that “clear” warning signs were in place, including notices about unstable ground, falling rocks and previous fatal accidents.The national park authority also maintained that signage clearly indicated the forward path was closed due to dangerous conditions.However, Dyer disputes this claim. “No one warned me. There were no barriers, no tape to say it was shut. I would never break the rules,” she said, calling for stronger preventative measures such as physical barriers and clearer hazard warnings.Waterfall Country has witnessed a surge in visitors since the Covid-19 pandemic, with approximately 300,000 people visiting annually. Since 2023, three walkers have died in the area, prompting renewed scrutiny over safety standards.In earlier inquests into similar deaths, a coroner had called for clearer and more direct signage at key points near waterfalls, warning that “future deaths could occur unless action is taken.” Concerns were also raised about the inadequate mobile phone signal in the remote terrain.Local residents say rescue call-outs have become frequent, especially on weekends, and have echoed demands for improved supervision and clearer warnings.While authorities say improvements have been made to footpaths, steps and signage, Dyer believes more decisive action is needed.“The road to recovery is long,” her husband said, adding that she remains in good spirits despite being largely confined to her sofa as she heals.For Dyer, the message is simple: better safety measures could save lives, and spare families the trauma she narrowly escaped.","Suzie Dyer, 50, was hiking with a friend on New Year's Day in Wales.

"Major row over Britain's Nato envoy Angus Lapsley bringing intern girlfriend, half his age, to official residence: 'They are not hiding it'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/major-row-over-britains-nato-envoy-angus-lapsley-bringing-intern-girlfriend-half-his-age-to-official-residence-they-are-not-hiding-it/articleshow/128274284.cms,"



Britain's ambassador to Nato, Angus Lapsley, has triggered a major diplomatic row after he brought his Italian girlfriend into his official residence in Brussels. The woman is nearly half her age and has been identified as Francesca Cortini, an intern, in reports. They met each other at Nato headquarters in Belgium. The couple has now set tongues wagging as insiders observed that they are not even trying to hide their relationship. The girlfriend was present at the residence for Christmas and summer receptions.The official residence, however, is not only meant for him.The lavist British residence in Belgium, a converted five-storey hotel, is also the address of two other Brotish ambassadors -- to Belgium and to the EU.The UK's incoming ambassador to the EU, Dame Caroline Wilson, who is yet to take charge and to shift to the address, said it was ""inappropriate"" for the pair to live together at the official residence.The relationship has been deemed so significant that Admiral Sir Keith Blount, Nato’s deputy supreme allied commander [in] Europe and the most senior British officer in the alliance, has reportedly been alerted.But the relationship won't cost Lapsley his pose as Nato policy does not prohibit a relationship between a senior official and a subordinate.Nato requires managers to declare any real or perceived conflict of interest and Lapsley made his bosses aware of the relationship that began after his separation from wife Gina.Lapsley, the father of two, is known for delinquency as he had his security clearance suspended in 2021 after he left top secret documents at a bus stop in Kent. The files had the locations of British special forces in Kabul.Lapsley also left behind at least one personal diary, which resulted in Ben Wallace, the defence secretary at the time, later calling for his security clearance to be reconsidered. Lapsley used the diary to express his frustration at the department and wrote about his relationships with individuals.The UK's incoming ambassador to the EU, Dame Caroline Wilson, said it was ""inappropriate"" for the pair to live together at the official residence.","Angus Lapsley has brought his Italian girlfriend into his official residence in Brussels.

British Indians have continually helped British economy prosper since WWII: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/british-indians-have-continually-helped-british-economy-prosper-since-wwii-report/articleshow/128273774.cms,"



LONDON: A white paper published by the Aston India Centre has shown how Indian migrants to the UK have repeatedly helped transform the British economy since World War II.Described as “one of the most consequential migration stories of modern Britain”, the paper, titled “Migration of the Indian Diaspora to the UK”, explores four waves of migrants from the 1940s post-war reconstruction to the post-2019 post-Brexit influx, showing how Indian migrants have strengthened Britain’s capacity to rebuild, adapt and prosper.It recommends the UK adopt a smarter migration strategy to align visa routes with employer demand, mutual qualification recognition with India, and for sector regulators in the UK and India to work together to verify credentials of workers and hold joint assessment clinics with employers to speed up recruitment and ensure the best people are hired.Written by the joint directors of Aston India Centre at Aston University, Prof Sangeeta Khorana and Prof Pawan Budhwar, as well as Manish Tiwari, chairman of Here&Now365, the report shows how Indian migrants have helped fill labour shortages since the 1940s. Until the 1970s there was no visa requirement for most Commonwealth citizens to move to the UK, and post-WWII the UK had many labour shortages which Indians came to fill, attracted by wage differentials and political upheaval back home.In 1972 a large number of Indians with British passports expelled from Uganda moved to the UK. More arrived via family reunion visas and set up businesses in places like Leicester and Birmingham.In the 1990s, Indians flowed to the UK to work in the services sector, especially IT, also transport, manufacturing and hospitality, attracted by the strong economy.Brexit in 2016 led to a loss of EU-origin workers in the UK. That, combined with policy liberalisation, led to a large influx of Indians as students, healthcare workers and skilled workers. Covid also triggered huge labour shortages in Britain. Indians are now the largest cohort on the skilled worker route and Indian migrants account for around 16% of all NHS professionals and 13% of the tech workforce.Since 2019 highly-skilled Indian migrants and entrepreneurs, specialists in AI, fintech, life sciences, advanced manufacturing and the digital sector, have established businesses and driven technological innovation not just in London, but in the regions as well. British Indians are now the wealthiest ethnic group in the UK by median net worth and have broadened Britain’s culinary traditions, music, film, literature and festivals. British Indians increasingly feature in public life, from local councils to being the PM, which helps social cohesion, the report said.Budhwar told TOI: “The white paper provides evidence-based analysis about the contribution of the Indian diaspora to the UK’s economy, culture and social capital. It highlights that the Indian diaspora are not a burden and are contributing significantly.”","White paper shows how Indian migrants to the UK have repeatedly helped transform the British economy since World War II.

Bangladeshi migrant avoids deportation from UK over 20-year jail sentence imposed under Sheikh Hasina’s regime in Dhaka,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/bangladeshi-migrant-avoids-deportation-from-uk-over-20-year-jail-sentence-imposed-under-sheikh-hasinas-regime-in-dhaka/articleshow/128273210.cms,"Protest Held Outside UK Parliament Demanding Labour Govt To Press Bangladesh Over Hindu Persecution





A Bangladeshi migrant has won the right to remain in Britain after a court ruled that he cannot be deported because he would face a 20-year prison sentence on explosives charges if he returned home.The man, referred to in court as MM, was granted asylum after successfully arguing that the charges against him in Bangladesh were false and politically motivated. He said he had been targeted by the previous Awami League government because of his links to an opposing political group, reports the Daily Mail.The Home Office accepted that the bomb charges were probably bogus but said that he could safely return because the political situation in Bangladesh had changed. However, the Upper Tribunal ruled in his favour.MM told the tribunal that he was a “political leader” of Islami Chhatra Shibir, the student wing of the Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami party. He said the Awami League had brought false criminal charges against him in 2015 while he was in Cyprus.He provided court documents showing that he had been convicted in his absence and sentenced to 20 years in prison. The documents were verified as genuine.Seven other men, including Ahsan Habib, Mostafa Kamal, Mehedi Hasan, Rabiul Islam, Monowar Hossain, Jamirul Islam and Moynul Islam, were previously convicted and given the same sentence.Upper Tribunal Judge Madeleine Reeds said: “[It was] confirmed that the [migrant's] case relied upon the preserved finding that there were genuinely issued court documents demonstrating that he had been convicted and sentenced to 20 years imprisonment and that there were two further outstanding arrest warrants and the question was what risk the [he] faced on return in light of having been convicted in absentia and considering the country information. ""They added: “He submitted that the Home Office's approach to the case was difficult to follow in light of the preserved finding that the documents were genuinely issued documents from the court that were politically motivated and false rather than based on any criminal conduct.""Also: “Those documents having been found to be genuine, is therefore determinative of the appeal in MM's favour.”The Home Office argued that the removal of Sheikh Hasina and the Awami League from power in August 2024 meant MM would no longer be at risk. After months of student-led protests that turned into a nationwide uprising, Hasina resigned and fled to India. A United Nations report said up to 1,400 people were killed during the unrest, most shot by security forces.Judge Reeds said the Awami League had not been fully removed from power and still had supporters inside government offices and law enforcement. She referred to reports saying the country remains unstable and that some innocent people have been arrested while authorities review cases believed to be politically motivated.She concluded: “I therefore conclude that there is a reasonable likelihood on these particular facts of the [migrant] being detained for what both parties accept are politically motivated charges and conviction and which are not legitimate and do not reflect any wrongdoing by [him].""And added: “Whilst they relate to events from the previous regime, the conviction remains and the sentence is a long one and on the evidence as it stands, there is a real risk that he will not be released on bail.”The tribunal allowed his appeal, meaning he will remain in UK.", Bangladeshi migrant has won the right to remain in Britain. Court ruled that he cannot be deported because he would face a 20-year prison sentence on explosives charges if he returned home. He said he had been targeted by the previous Awami League government because of his links to an opposing political group.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128273210,imgsize-1493062,width-400,resizemode-4/128273210.jpg"

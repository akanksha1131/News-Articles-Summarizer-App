US President-elect Donald Trump nominates former congressman Billy Long as IRS commissioner,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-president-elect-donald-trump-nominates-former-congressman-billy-long-as-irs-commissioner/articleshow/115988862.cms,"US President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday nominated former Missouri Republican congressman Billy Long as the head of the Internal Revenue Service , signalling the removal of the current Biden-appointed leader.Trump made this announcement via his social media platform, proposing a change at the IRS during a crucial period when the Biden administration has invested heavily in modernising the agency and enhancing tax collection procedures.""I am pleased to announce that former Congressman Billy Long, of the Great State of Missouri, will be appointed to serve as the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Billy brings 32 years of experience running his own businesses in Real Estate and, as one of the premier Auctioneers in the country. He then served 12 years in Congress, because he 'felt it was important for his constituents to have a Representative who has signed the front of a check!'"" Trump said in a post on Truth Social.Daniel Werfel, appointed by President Joe Biden in 2022, currently leads the IRS. Werfel, who brought experience from both Democratic and Republican administrations as a former management consultant and civil servant, was meant to serve until 2027.The Republican party has consistently opposed the Biden administration's IRS strategy, particularly the allocation of approximately $80 billion in additional funding over ten years. GOP representatives successfully reduced this amount by $20 billion and continue to seek further reductions. The IRS faces public unpopularity, with Republicans frequently criticising it as intrusive and inefficient, New York Times reported.Budget specialists indicate that increased IRS funding helps generate government revenue through improved tax law enforcement and collection of owed taxes.Long, who previously worked as an auctioneer, did not participate in the House tax-writing committee during his congressional tenure. However, he demonstrated his auctioneering abilities in Washington, notably when Trump invited him to conduct a lighthearted auction of the Stanley Cup during the St. Louis Blues' White House visit.Trump stated on social media: ""I have known Billy since 2011 - He is an extremely hard worker, and respected by all, especially by those who know him in Congress. Taxpayers and the wonderful employees of the IRS will love having Billy at the helm.""Traditionally, presidents do not appoint new IRS commissioners upon taking office, and Long's appointment requires Senate confirmation. Biden waited for Charles P. Rettig's term to conclude before appointing Werfel.In a recent Tax Notes podcast, Werfel expressed: ""I have a vision of my last day on the job being Nov. 12, 2027. My frame of mind on the IRS is that it's nonpartisan, is that our priorities can and should shift with new Treasury leadership.""","US President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday nominated former Missouri Republican congressman Billy Long as the head of the Internal Revenue Service.

Manhunt underway for killer of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson after fatal shooting,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/manhunt-underway-for-killer-of-unitedhealthcare-ceo-brian-thompson-after-fatal-shooting/articleshow/115988631.cms,"A manhunt for the killer of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson , who was shot dead on Wednesday morning, is underway.Brian Thompson, 50, was shot outside the Hilton hotel at 1335 Avenue of the Americas just after 6:45 am after arriving early for the company’s annual investor conference. A man wearing a mask approached him and fired at him repeatedly, police said as per CBS news.The shooting happened ahead of an investors conference that UnitedHealth Group, the parent company of UnitedHealthcare, was scheduled to host on Wednesday at the Hilton, according to a spokesperson for the subsidiary.According to the cctv footage, that is being circulated on social media platforms, the shooter appeared to be a light-skinned male, wearing a light-brown or cream-colored jacket, a black face mask, black and white sneakers, and a distinctive grey backpack.Authorities said the gun appeared to malfunction, and the gunman cleared the jam before firing again and fleeing northbound into an alleyway between 54th Street and 55th Street. The shooter then continued to walk westbound on the Avenue of the Americas, where he got on to an electric Citi Bike and rode northbound towards Central Park, CBS news reported.Police say they recovered three live 9mm rounds and three discharged 9mm shell casings. Authorities also recovered a cellphone.Authorities are also investigating the suspect's point of origin.Surveillance images released by the police show the suspect at a Starbucks, located two blocks from the incident, moments before the shooting. According to police statements to CBS News, they discovered unspecified ""forensic evidence"" at the Starbucks location. The NYPD 's Crime Scene Unit is currently testing recovered items for DNA and fingerprints.At UnitedHealthcare, investigators and security personnel are examining records to establish potential motives, including any previous threats or connections to dissatisfied or terminated employees, according to a law enforcement source. The organisation has confirmed its support of the investigation . Kenny stated that police are reviewing social media content and conducting interviews with employees, family members, and Thompson's associates.","Brian Thompson, 50, was shot outside the Hilton hotel at 1335 Avenue of the Americas just after 6:45 am.

"Biden administration weighs preemptive pardons for Fauci, Schiff, and other ahead of Trump return",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/biden-administration-weighs-preemptive-pardons-for-for-fauci-schiff-and-other-ahead-of-trump-return/articleshow/115987950.cms,"US President Joe Biden ’s senior aides in the White House are conducting a vigorous internal debate over issuing preemptive pardons to protect various public officials, including Dr Anthony Fauci from potential prosecution under a Trump administration, who is set to take over the presidential post next month, according to the Politico report.The urgency has heightened following President-elect Donald Trump 's announcement of Kash Patel as his choice to lead the FBI, given Patel's public statements about pursuing Trump's critics. However, officials are cautious about issuing pardons to individuals who haven't committed crimes, as it might appear improper and validate Trump's criticisms.The discussions, led by White House counsel Ed Siskel and chief of staff Jeff Zients, encompass both current officeholders and former officials who have drawn Trump's ire. Potential candidates include Sen.-elect Adam Schiff, former Rep. Liz Cheney, and Dr Fauci. Trump has previously stated that ""Cheney should go to Jail along with the rest of the Unselect Committee!""As soon as the report came, Dr Fauci's odds of being pardoned by President Biden skyrocket on Polymarket.These deliberations reflect growing concerns among Democrats about potential retribution under a second Trump presidency. The recent broad pardon of Hunter Biden demonstrates the administration's worries about future prosecutions.Some Democratic lawmakers support preemptive pardons, citing the precedent of Gerald Ford's pardon of Richard Nixon. Senator Ed Markey and Representative Brendan Boyle have publicly advocated for such measures. However, others, including potential recipients like Schiff, have expressed reservations.A particular concern for Biden's team is the financial burden of legal defence that investigations could impose on officials. Some appointees are reportedly seeking higher-paying positions to prepare for potential legal expenses.The administration also faces pressure to extend clemency to ordinary citizens, particularly following Hunter Biden's pardon. Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries has called for pardons for working-class Americans imprisoned for non-violent offences, as per Politico.The central question revolves around interpreting Trump's statements about potential retribution against Democrats and perceived Deep State opponents, considering both their seriousness and literal implications.Historical presidential pardons have sparked controversy, yet the current situation facing Biden officials appears more complex than previous cases, such as George HW Bush's pardon of Caspar Weinberger or Bill Clinton's pardon of Marc Rich. The situation intensifies as Trump's associates discuss potential tribunals against opponents.The president's decision to pardon his son has created additional complications, particularly amongst Democratic Party members already concerned about Biden's re-election campaign at age 82. The administration now faces questions about extending similar legal protection to officials who have drawn criticism from Trump and his supporters.Congressional Democrats present conflicting viewpoints. Senator Ed Markey (D-Mass.) has referenced Gerald Ford's pre-emptive pardon of Richard Nixon as a potential model, noting its implementation before any formal charges.""If it's clear by January 19 that [revenge] is his intention, then I would recommend to President Biden that he provide those preemptive pardons to people, because that's really what our country is going to need next year,"" Markey said on WGBH last week.Representative Brendan Boyle (D-Penn.), who recently hosted Biden in his district, has advocated for comprehensive pardons. ""This is no hypothetical threat,"" Boyle stated, continuing: ""The time for cautious restraint is over. We must act with urgency to push back against these threats and prevent Trump from abusing his power.""","US President Joe Biden’s senior aides in the White House are conducting a vigorous internal debate over issuing preemptive pardons to protect public officials.

Why Joe Biden pardoned his son

White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre came under fire Monday after President Joe Biden announced pardon to his son Hunter Biden -- a move any hint of which was consistently shot down by the White House. And the press secretary, whenever asked whether Biden would pardon his son, said no. On Monday, Jean-Pierre was asked aboard Air Force One why she persistently lied about the issue to which the press secretary reacted by saying: ""The president took an action because of how politically infected these cases were.""“The system doesn’t get corrupted by politics for people whose name is not Biden?” a reporter asked. “You’re twisting and misrepresenting what I’m saying. I’m talking about a particular issue right now,” Jean-Pierre said.“Does the president believe now and agree with President-elect Trump that the justice system has been weaponized for political purposes and that it needs root and branch reform?” another asked.“No. Read the president’s statement. Seriously, read the president’s statement. He said he believes in the Department of Justice. He does. He says it in his statement. He also believes that war politics infected the process and it led to a miscarriage of justice,” she said.In his statement, Joe Biden said he wrestled with the decision which was made over the weekend. ""I believe in the justice system, but as I have wrestled with this, I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice — and once I made this decision this weekend, there was no sense in delaying it further. I hope Americans will understand why a father and a President would come to this decision,"" Biden said.""No reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter’s cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son — and that is wrong,"" Biden said in his statement. ""There has been an effort to break Hunter — who has been five and a half years sober, even in the face of unrelenting attacks and selective prosecution. In trying to break Hunter, they’ve tried to break me — and there’s no reason to believe it will stop here. Enough is enough.""Hunter Biden was scheduled to be sentenced on December 12 for his conviction on federal gun charges. On December 16, he was to be sentenced for a separate criminal case of tax evasion.","Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, repeatedly said Joe Biden would not pardon his son Hunter Biden.

Ousted Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina accused country's interim leader Muhammad Yunus of failing to safeguard minority communities and perpetrating what she described as ""genocide.""In her first public address since resigning in August amidst widespread anti-government protests, Hasina, speaking virtually at an event in New York, alleged targeted attacks on religious minorities, including Hindus, Buddhists, and Christians.Speaking at an event marking Bangladesh's Vijay Diwas , the Awami League leader highlighted the worsening plight of minorities under the current regime. ""What is this persecution of minorities for? Why are they being ruthlessly attacked?"" she questioned.She also claimed there was a plot to assassinate her and her sister Sheikh Rehana, mirroring the tragic fate of their father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who was assassinated in 1975.According to a report by news agency PTI, she referred to her ouster and the violent storming of her official residence, Ganabhaban, on August 5. Hasina said, “The armed protestors were directed toward Ganabhaban. If the security guards had opened fire, many lives would have been lost. I was forced to leave, and I told them not to fire no matter what happened.”Hasina, speaking in Bengali, said Yunus and other leaders of the interim government were orchestrating violence against minorities. “Today, I am being accused of genocide. In reality, Yunus has been involved in genocide in a meticulously designed manner. Hindus, Buddhists, Christians – no one has been spared. Eleven churches have been razed, temples and Buddhist shrines have been broken. When Hindus protested, the Iskcon leader was arrested.”She further alleged that her decision to leave Bangladesh in August was aimed at reducing violence but lamented that attacks on minorities had only intensified.During the event, Hasina also alleged a conspiracy to assassinate her and her sister. “When people were dying indiscriminately, I decided I should leave,” she said, adding that the violence continued despite her resignation.India has expressed growing concerns over escalating violence and persecution of minorities, particularly Hindus, in Bangladesh.Bangladesh's interim government head, Muhammad Yunus, has accused the ousted Sheikh Hasina regime of ""destroying everything"" and vowed to delay general elections until sweeping constitutional and judicial reforms are implemented. The remarks came in an interview with Nikkei Asia and were reported by Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha on Wednesday.The 84-year-old Nobel laureate emphasised the need for comprehensive changes in governance before the country can proceed to the polls. ""We need comprehensive reforms in the economy, governance, bureaucracy, and judiciary (before holding elections),"" Yunus said.Yunus also reiterated his government's intent to seek Sheikh Hasina’s extradition from India once her trial in Bangladesh's International Crimes Tribunal concludes. “Once the trial concludes and a verdict is reached, we will formally request India to hand her over,” Yunus said, adding that an international treaty signed by both nations would obligate India to comply.","Ousted Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina accused country's interim leader Muhammad Yunus of failing to safeguard minority communities.

Nepal signs framework agreement with China on Belt and Road initiative after years of delay,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/nepal-signs-framework-agreement-with-china-on-belt-and-road-initiative-after-years-of-delay/articleshow/115973377.cms,"Nepal, China sign Framework for Belt and Road Cooperation replacing 'grant financing' with 'aid financing'

Nepal has signed a framework agreement with China to move forward on the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the country's foreign ministry announced on Wednesday. This development comes seven years after an initial pact was signed in 2017, marking a significant step toward implementing infrastructure projects under China’s ambitious global connectivity program.The agreement was signed during Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s four-day visit to Beijing, his first foreign trip since taking office in July.""Today, we signed the Framework for Belt & Roads Cooperation,"" Oli announced on X. ""As my official visit to China concludes, I am honoured to reflect on the bilateral talks with Premier Li Qiang, discussions with NPC Chairman Zhang Leji, and the highly fruitful meeting with President Xi Jinping.""Breaking with tradition, Oli chose China over India for his inaugural visit, signaling a shift in Kathmandu’s diplomatic priorities. Historically, Nepal has maintained strong cultural and economic ties with New Delhi.The agreement, signed by Nepal’s foreign secretary Amrit Bahadur Rai and China’s Liu Sushe of the national development and reform commission, is expected to pave the way for implementing BRI projects. However, specifics of the framework remain undisclosed.Though Nepal joined the BRI in 2017, no projects have been realized under the framework so far. In a joint statement, both nations reaffirmed their commitment to building the trans-himalayan multi-dimensional connectivity network (THMDCN) and enhancing connectivity in areas like roads, railways, aviation, and power grids.""Both sides expressed their commitment to strengthening connectivity between the two countries... to help Nepal transform from a land-locked country to a land-linked country,"" the statement read.The BRI framework agreement lays the groundwork for project planning and financing, potentially including road upgrades and new transportation corridors. Until now, no projects had materialized due to the absence of a formal cooperation framework and political divisions in Nepal.Debt concerns have sparked debate within Nepal’s coalition government. While the agreement may unlock new opportunities, the Nepali Congress party, a key ally in Oli’s coalition, opposes reliance on loans for these initiatives.China has already funded key projects in Nepal, such as the Pokhara International Airport , constructed with a $216 million loan under the BRI. Although hailed by Beijing as a success, the airport faces operational challenges, including limited international flights due to India’s airspace restrictions.Addressing a gathering at Peking University, Oli highlighted the potential benefits of the BRI for Nepal. ""China has strongly supported Nepal's development, and the BRI project initiated under the visionary leadership of President Xi Jinping would further deepen bilateral relations,"" he said.Calling for Chinese investments, Oli assured, ""We will facilitate the investments for realising the national aspiration 'Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali.' We are committed to providing investment security.""Foreign minister Arzu Rana Deuba echoed these sentiments, saying that Oli’s visit had elevated Nepal-China relations to new heights.",Nepal has signed a framework agreement with China to move forward on the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) This development comes seven years after an initial pact was signed in 2017.

DHAKA: Bangladesh must ensure ""appropriate"" legal representation for all detainees in keeping with basic human rights principles , a US state department spokesperson said in Washington, hours after arrested Hindu monk Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari's bail hearing in a Chittagong court on Tuesday was adjourned by a month as he didn't have a counsel.Principal deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel said this after a reporter wanted to know US's response on the monk, who has been charged with sedition, not finding ""a willing lawyer"" in Bangladesh to represent him since being arrested and jailed.Patel said his view was ""consistent with"" what US expected of every government. ""There needs to be respect for fundamental freedoms, respect for religious freedom and basic human rights,"" he said.Vedant Patel said any kind of protest “needs to be peaceful” and that, during any crackdown, governments must respect the rule of law and uphold basic human rights. “And that’s something we will continue to emphasise.”In Dhaka, the interim government's chief adviser Muhammad Yunus issued an invitation to Indian journalists to investigate allegations about persecution of Hindus and report the reality. “We are working to explain this to the Indian government and counter the misinformation,” he said. This was after his meeting Wednesday with members of all parties, barring ousted Awami League, to seek “national unity” amid growing outrage over Chinmoy Krishna’s arrest and reports of atrocities on Hindus and other minorities.Yunus advised politicians to steer clear of attempts at “provocation”, dismissing reports of continuing attacks on Hindus as “propaganda”. He said it was imperative to inform the world that “Bangladesh remains united and is resilient against any fabricated narratives from abroad”. Yunus has convened another meeting Thursday with religious leaders.","Bangladesh must ensure ""appropriate"" legal representation for all detainees, US says.

Media criticism

Allegations cloud nomination

Penelope Hegseth , the mother of Pete Hegseth , President-elect Donald Trump ’s nominee for secretary of defence, is now defending her son after previously accusing him of mistreating women in a 2018 email.Speaking on Fox News’ ‘Fox & Friends’ on Wednesday, she claimed her earlier words were written ""in haste"" and with ""deep emotions"" during a difficult period in her son’s life.“I wrote that out of love,” Penelope said during the interview, explaining that the email was sent during Pete’s contentious divorce from his second wife, Samantha.The email, published by The New York Times, accused Pete of being an “abuser of women” and criticised him for “dishonesty, sleeping around, betrayal, debasing, and belittling.” However, she noted that just two hours later, she sent an apology email retracting her accusations, although that email has not surfaced publicly.Penelope Hegseth took aim at The New York Times for publishing her email, accusing the outlet of threatening her for a comment. “They say, ‘Unless you make a statement, we will publish it as is.’ I think that’s a despicable way to treat anyone,” she told Fox News.She expressed gratitude to Trump for his belief in her son, stating, “Trump knows Pete. And he knows the Pete of today.” Penelope described her son as a devoted patriot and father, adding, “He’s fought and almost died for this country.”Hegseth’s nomination has been overshadowed by a slew of allegations, including sexual misconduct, financial mismanagement at veterans' charities, and concerns over his drinking habits.A 2017 police report alleged sexual assault, which Hegseth denied but later settled out of court for an undisclosed sum. The New Yorker also detailed claims from former colleagues that Hegseth turned a blind eye to harassment and engaged in inappropriate behaviour while leading veteran advocacy groups.Despite these accusations, Hegseth has remained resolute. Speaking to CBS News, he said, “Why would I back down? I’ve always been a fighter. I’m here for the fighters.”President-elect Trump has so far stood by Hegseth, reportedly telling him to “keep fighting” amid the increasing criticism.As the allegations mount, speculation has arisen that Trump may replace Hegseth with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis , a former Navy legal officer. DeSantis, who was initially considered for the role, is reportedly back on the shortlist, as doubts about Hegseth’s confirmation continue to grow.Meanwhile, Hegseth continues to meet with Republican senators to garner support, but his path to confirmation appears increasingly challenging.Reports from CBS News indicate that several senators, including Lindsey Graham, have expressed concerns about the “disturbing” allegations.","Penelope Hegseth previously accused her son of mistreating women in an email.

Dr Nicole Saphier, a prominent Fox News contributor, has strongly defended her colleague Pete Hegseth following an NBC News report alleging concerns about his on-air conduct. Saphier, known for her regular appearances on ‘Fox & Friends’, dismissed the claims on social media, saying she has never witnessed any unprofessional behaviour from Hegseth during their years of working together.Taking to platform X, formerly Twitter, Saphier wrote: ""I have routinely sat on the couch with @PeteHegseth for 8 years. Not once did I suspect he had consumed anything other than an egg sandwich and coffee before going on air.""Her statement follows NBC News's report citing ""10 current and former Fox employees"" who alleged smelling alcohol on Hegseth before broadcasts, a claim Saphier, along with other Fox personalities, has categorically denied.Will Cain, a current cohost of Fox & Friends, described the allegations as ""horses***"" on X, while fellow cohost Rachel Campos-Duffy echoed similar sentiments, criticising NBC for relying on anonymous sources and not reaching out to Hegseth's closest colleagues.Campos-Duffy stated, ""The losers at NBC News never reached out to me either… You now have 2 people who sat next to him 8+ hours a week on the record.""Other Fox News contributors have also rallied behind Hegseth. Guy Benson, Joey Jones, and Lisa Boothe all dismissed the claims as baseless, with Boothe calling the report a ""malicious smear.""Piers Morgan, a frequent guest on Fox & Friends, also lent his voice in support, describing Hegseth as ""utterly professional on camera and a nice, respectful guy off it.""The controversy has surfaced at a pivotal moment for Hegseth, who has been nominated by President-elect Donald Trump to serve as the next US Secretary of Defense.A Trump transition spokesperson categorically denied the allegations, describing them as ""disgusting"" and politically motivated attacks against a ""decorated combat veteran.""As the controversies around Pete Hegseth continue to mount, Trump is reportedly considering replacing Hegseth with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis as his pick for secretary of defence, reported the Wall Street Journal.","Nicole Saphier, a Fox News contributor, has strongly defended her colleague Pete Hegseth following an NBC News report alleging concerns about his on-air conduct.

Karachi, meanwhile, recorded an AQI of around 200, indicating ""very unhealthy"" air quality, and ranked as the fourth most polluted city globally. The air quality in Karachi slightly improved during the day but largely remained unsafe.The smog crisis extends beyond Lahore and Karachi, affecting other major cities. Multan reported an AQI of 294, making it the second-most polluted city in Pakistan. Rawalpindi and Peshawar recorded AQIs of 220 and 204, respectively, reflecting a similar trend of dangerously poor air quality, reported the Express Tribune.Even Islamabad, the federal capital, experienced elevated pollution levels, with an AQI of 170, ranking it seventh among Pakistcities. Experts attribute this widespread air pollution to unregulated vehicle emissions, industrial waste, and urban development patterns that neglect environmental considerations.Health experts have raised alarms over the long-term effects of such unprecedented pollution levels, particularly on vulnerable populations. Before this crisis, air pollution was responsible for 12 per cent of deaths in children under five in Pakistan, The Express Tribune reported.With the current smog emergency, these numbers are likely to rise sharply.Children, pregnant women, and individuals with pre-existing health conditions are expected to bear the brunt of the health consequences, which could have devastating impacts in the coming years if corrective measures are not urgently implemented.","Lahore has emerged as the most polluted city in the world, with air quality levels described as ""hazardous"" The city's PM2.5 concentration levels were measured to be 24.2 times above the World Health Organisation's (WHO) recommended guidelines.

Pak sectarian violence: Death toll rises to 130 as clashes continue in Kurram despite ceasefire,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pak-sectarian-violence-death-toll-rises-to-130-as-clashes-continue-in-kurram-despite-ceasefire/articleshow/115868783.cms,"PTI photo

PESHAWAR: The death toll from sectarian violence in Pakistan's restive Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province surged to 130, with at least six people killed and eight injured on Sunday, as clashes in the volatile Kurram district continued for the eleventh consecutive day.The clashes between Alizai and Bagan tribes in the district started on November 22, after an attack on a convoy of passenger vans near Parachinar in which 47 people were killed a day earlier. Several passengers who had sustained grave injuries succumbed later, raising the toll in the convoy killing to 57.Police said the situation remained tense, and violence persists despite a recent ceasefire agreement between the Sunni and Shia groups.The six new deaths reported on Sunday brought the death toll to 130, while the total number of injured rose to 186 after eight fresh injuries were reported.The 10-day truce brokered last week has been rendered ineffective by intermittent violence, which shows no signs of abating.A high-powered delegation, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Secretary Nadeem Aslam Chaudhry and IGP Akhtar Hayat Gandapur, had also negotiated a ceasefire last weekend, but violence resumed shortly afterwards.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi earlier planned to dispatch members of the grandpeace jirga (council of tribal leaders) from Kohat division to Kurram for engaging with leaders from both warring factions to negotiate peace.Addressing a gathering of political leaders and tribal elders in Kohat on Sunday, he called for strict action with public cooperation to make the region weapon-free through joint operations.He said he was ready to go to Kurram and stay there for as many days as the jirga suggested to ensure peace in the region.""No other country or province will resolve our issues. We must take responsibility for improving the situation ourselves,"" he said.Kundi announced an All-Parties Conference (APC) for peace and the province's rights and invited Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur to join it.The governor stressed the role of religious scholars in promoting peace, urging them to focus on unity.Several other leaders addressed the gathering, putting aside their ideological differences on other issues.The continued violence forced the closure of the main Peshawar-Parachinar Road for travel, and commuting at the Pak-Afghan Kharlachi border has also been suspended.The closure of the main arteries has created a scarcity of oil, food commodities and medicines in the region.The Kurram region is also experiencing a communication blackout, with mobile and internet services suspended and educational institutions closed.Police and other security forces personnel had been deployed in various parts of Lower Kurram, said Deputy Commissioner Javed Ullah Mehsud, adding that all-out efforts will be made for a truce in other areas today as well.""We are hopeful for progress on a ceasefire and reopening of transport routes,"" he stated.Previous efforts to mediate peace, including a seven-day truce brokered by provincial officials in November have failed to hold.","Death toll from sectarian violence in Pakistan's restive Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province surges to 130.

They have been identified as Waris, son of Saleem, and Nisar, son of Aslam. They were taken to an unknown location.In Karachi, a rickshaw driver named Sadiq Ahmed, son of Dilmurad, and a resident of Kan Gichk, was reportedly arrested in the Lea Market area. His whereabouts are also unknown.During this series of disappearances, one individual, Sheyak, son of Allah Bakhsh, who was abducted in Gwadar on November 22, has since returned home.Human rights activists and advocacy organizations have expressed grave concern over the escalating cases of enforced disappearances in Balochistan.

The Baloch nation is enduring the worst forms of oppression. With each passing day, disturbing reports of extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances emerge. Hundreds of innocent individuals and their families are subjected to this cruel practice, and in many cases, these victims are executed.""The statement further condemned the silence of human rights organizations and the media, highlighting that the genocide of the Baloch people is intensifying while the world remains indifferent. The lives of the Baloch people hold no significance to anyone. State violence has reached its peak.In the statement posted on X, BYC stated, ""Today alone, eight Baloch individuals were forcibly disappeared from a single household, leaving behind no male member, including an elderly person, Dr. Zafar, and his son, Raheem Baloch. Additionally, five of Dr. Zafar's guests were abducted from his house. While Dr. Zafar was later released after severe humiliation and torture, the others remain forcibly disappeared.""The BYC expressed its grave concern, emphasizing that despite their peaceful efforts, the genocide they are resisting is rapidly intensifying.Vowing to continue its resistance movement, the BYC stated, ""We can never, and will never, remain indifferent while our people endure such brutality. BYC will continue to strengthen and expand the resistance movement against the ongoing Baloch genocide.""",At least 10 Baloch men have been reportedly forcibly disappeared by Pakistforces in separate incidents.

"Trump floats deal with Russia, China to cut defence spending",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-floats-deal-with-russia-china-to-cut-defence-spending/articleshow/118292422.cms,"Donald Trump

President Trump floated the idea of a three-way meeting with the leaders of Russia and China in which the countries would agree to cut defence spending in half.Trump, speaking to reporters in the Oval Office Thursday, suggested that he'd seek such a deal with Presidents Xi and Putin, saying the money could be spent better elsewhere. ""One of the first meetings I want to have is with President Xi of China, President Putin of Russia,"" Trump said. ""And I want to say, 'let's cut our military budget in half.' And we can do that. And I think we'll be able to do it.""The comments topped off another one of the free-wheeling press interactions that have become common in Trump's second term. Such deep cuts in defence spending would fundamentally reshape US military posture around the world and face sharp pushback from US contractors and lawmakers whose states benefit from billions of dollars in defence spending every year.Trump's views also underscored how willing he is to upend standard foreign-policy craft in Washington. He has made no secret of his desire for closer ties with Russia and China, two US adversaries. He sparked an uproar this week by having a phone call with Putin to start talks on ending the Ukraine war. US allies in Europe said any such talks must take place with Ukraine's participation.It's also far from certain that China or Russia would agree to such cuts given how US defence spending of about $850 billion dwarfs their annual outlays. China was forecast to spend about $230 billion in 2024 and is in the middle of a major military expansion. Russia's 2024 budget has grown significantly since the start of war in Ukraine but was still about half that.When asked about Trump's remarks at a regular press briefing in Beijing on Friday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said ""the limited national defence spending of China is what is needed to defend its national sovereignty, security and development interests, and what is needed to safeguard world peace.""",President Trump said he wants to meet with the leaders of Russia and China.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called Saturday for the creation of a European army , as he insisted Kyiv and its backers on the continent must be listened to in peace talks with Russia .Speaking at a gathering of top policymakers in Munich, the Ukrainian leader said that with the return of President Donald Trump to the White House Europe could no longer count on Washington to always have its back.Trump stunned allies and upended the status quo of US support for Ukraine this week when he announced he would likely soon meet Russian leader Vladimir Putin to start truce talks.Zelenskyy's rallying cry came a day after he met US Vice President JD Vance as Kyiv scrambles to ensure it is not sidelined in Washington's push to wrap up the three-year war. ""Let's be honest - now we can't rule out the possibility that America might say no to Europe on issues that threaten it,"" Zelenskyy said. ""I really believe that time has come. The Armed Forces of Europe must be created.""The push for a joint continental force has been mooted for years without gaining traction and Zelenskyy's intervention seems unlikely to shift the balance.In the short-term, the priority for Kyiv remains ensuring its voice is heard at any peace talks involving Russia and that it doesn't get a bad deal. ""Ukraine will never accept deals made behind our backs without our involvement,"" Zelenskyy said in a speech. ""No decisions about Ukraine without Ukraine. No decisions about Europe without Europe.""

Allies of Elon Musk 's stationed within the education department are considering replacing some contract workers who interact with millions of students and parents annually with an artificial intelligence chatbot , according to internal department documents and communications.The proposal is part of President Donald Trump's broader effort to shrink the federal workforce and would mark a major change in how the agency interacts with the public. The education department's biggest job is managing billions of dollars in student aid, and it routinely fields complex questions from borrowers.The department currently uses call centers and a rudimentary AI bot to answer questions. The proposal would introduce generative AI , a more sophisticated version of AI that could replace many of those human agents. The call centres employ 1,600 who field over 15,000 questions per day from student borrowers.The vision could be a model for other federal agencies, in which humans are replaced by technology, and behemoth contracts with outside companies are shed or reduced in favor of more automated solutions. In some cases, that technology was developed by players from the private sector who are now working inside or with the Trump administration .","The proposal is part of President Donald Trump's broader effort to shrink the federal workforce.

'Fire Them': Trump's Executive Order Shocks U.S; Musk To Axe 15 Federal Agencies' Employees



None of this has been done thoughtfully or carefully

CDC workforce faces major reduction under Trump administration



Trump administration removes nuclear staff, who oversee country’s weapons stockpile

The Trump administration's workforce reduction measures had left federal workers anxious and bewildered. Unknown about their future, the probationary staff who lack civil service protections are struggling to find a way to save their job.Federal employees expressed significant distress on Friday regarding the administration's latest workforce reduction initiative. As dismissal notices circulated throughout agencies, affected staff nationwide struggled with the sudden changes.Several employees who had accepted deferred resignation offers found themselves terminated regardless, raising questions about others in similar situations.Some federal staff members facing termination were given a mere 30 minutes to collect their items and depart from government premises. Moreover, the firing was done via Microsoft Teams group calls or pre-recorded messages. Some were told that they would be laid off over email but never received such mails.Following Donald Trump's directive, federal organisations were instructed to dismiss primarily probationary personnel, affecting up to 200,000 staff members, with some being hastily escorted out, according to the Washington Post.Friday witnessed additional extensive job cuts as the US interior department terminated approximately 2,300 staff members.The interior department, responsible for the nation's natural resources and administration of 500m acres of public territory, including national parks, underwent significant staff reductions. Three anonymous sources with direct knowledge confirmed these widespread dismissals to Reuters.Reuters also reported dismissals of probationary staff at two US agriculture department research facilities, citing two unnamed sources. While the precise number of dismissed employees remains unconfirmed, the terminations reportedly occurred overnight.A disabled Army paratrooper, David Rice , discovered his termination from the US department of energy on Thursday evening, where he had been serving as a probationary employee since September.Rice, who handled foreign affairs specialising in radiation exposure health matters, had received assurances about his position's security. However, upon logging in for a meeting Thursday evening, he discovered his termination notice via email.""It's just been chaos,"" stated Rice , 50, who relocated to Melbourne, Florida, and purchased a house after securing the position.Whilst supporting government efficiency measures, Rice expressed dissatisfaction with the implementation. ""It's just random people, they're probational people, getting fired for no reason other than the fact that they're easier to let go,"" he explained.He emphasised that government workers aren't adversaries. ""We're just out here trying to do something that we actually believe in, that matters,"" Rice said.A judicial order has temporarily halted mass redundancies and data removal at the consumer financial protection bureau. This came after the employees' union initiated legal proceedings, with their legal representatives emphasising the urgency to prevent widespread dismissals and data elimination.The directive remains effective until March 3, when US District Judge Amy Berman Jackson will review the case. The administration has already suspended most CFPB operations and closed its premises. The organisation was established post-2008 financial crisis to safeguard consumer interests.Nicholas Detter, formerly employed in Kansas as a natural resource specialist supporting farmers with soil and water conservation, received his dismissal via email Thursday night. Despite agreeing to the administration's deferred resignation scheme, promising payment until September 30, Detter never received the official agreement despite his documented acceptance.""None of this has been done thoughtfully or carefully,"" he remarked, noting that such dismissals would create significant delays in the programme established after the 1930s Dust Bowl.Andrew Lennox , a 10-year Marine veteran and probationary employee at the Veterans Affairs Medical Centre in Ann Arbor, Michigan, received an unexpected termination email Thursday evening.""In order to help veterans, you just fired a veteran,"" said Lennox, 35, an ex-USMC infantryman with service in Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria. Having joined the VA in mid-December, Lennox expressed his desire to continue serving. ""This is my family, and I would like to do this forever,"" he stated.The VA announced over 1,000 dismissals on their website, citing annual savings exceeding $98 million and improved veteran services. ""I was like: 'What about this one,'"" Lennox commented.Approximately 1,300 probationary staff at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will lose their positions, representing about 10% of the agency's total workforce under the Trump administration's directive.CDC leadership received verbal notification during a Friday meeting with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, according to an anonymous federal official present at the meeting who spoke to The Associated Press confidentially.The impacted staff will receive four weeks of paid administrative leave, though the timing of individual notifications remains unclear.The CDC, operating with a £9.2 billion core budget, serves as America's primary defence against public health threats. Prior to these reductions, the organisation employed approximately 13,000 people, including over 2,000 staff stationed internationally.Trump administration officials terminated over 300 personnel on Thursday night at the National Nuclear Security Administration, an organisation responsible for nuclear stockpile management, as part of wider Energy Department redundancies, according to four informed sources.CNN sources indicated the officials appeared unaware of the agency's role in overseeing American nuclear weapons.An Energy Department representative challenged the reported figures, informing CNN that ""less than 50 people"" were ""dismissed"" from NNSA, primarily those in administrative and clerical positions.The organisation began withdrawing the dismissals on Friday morning.The dismissed staff included NNSA personnel stationed at nuclear weapons manufacturing facilities. These employees supervised contractors involved in nuclear weapons production and conducted weapons inspections.The terminations also affected NNSA headquarters staff responsible for documentation.","Federal employees expressed significant distress on Friday regarding the administration's latest workforce reduction initiative.

He's going to say, 'Everything is on the table, let's make a deal'.""Whilst affirming Ukraine's independence as a non-negotiable element in any agreement with Putin, Vance was non-committal about the extent of Russian-occupied territory that might remain under Kremlin control.""There are any number of formulations, of configurations, but we do care about Ukraine having sovereign independence,"" the vice president explained. The specifics of security guarantees from the US or European nations would be determined during negotiations, according to Vance.He indicated that Trump might adjust negotiating terms based on how discussions progress.Vance elaborated on Trump's flexibility, suggesting items could be added or removed from negotiations depending on the parties' behaviour and Ukrainian priorities.Trump posted on Truth Social: ""[W]e want to stop the millions of deaths taking place in the War with Russia/Ukraine.""Later Thursday, Trump confirmed Ukraine's participation in Russian negotiations whilst expressing support for Russia's return to the G-7.","US Vice President JD Vance said the US might impose sanctions and consider military intervention if Russia's Vladimir Putin fails to conclude the ongoing Ukraine conflict.

NEW DELHI: Eight years after he was declared an absconder by a court in Delhi, Mohammed Usman , a hardened operative of the al-Qaida in Indian subcontinent ( AQIS ) has been traced in Pakistan, sources say.Usman is learnt to be lodged in Lahore jail subsequent to his arrest in a criminal case in that country. A routine enquiry from the ministry of external affairs by the Pak govt about a dozen Indian origin inmates and fishermen lodged in different jail led to this discovery and ultimately blew Usman's cover.Usman, a resident of Sambhal , had absconded after Delhi Police's special cell first the first AQIS module in 2015. He was termed a fugitive in 2016 along with other AQIS chiefs Asim Umar aka Sanaul Haq and Farhatullah Ghori besides other operatives identified as Sharjeel Akhtar, Mohammed Arshiyan, Rehan, Shahid Faisal, Umar Hyderabadi and Abu Sufiyan.A group of arrested AQIS operatives including Mohammad Asif were convicted in 2023. The court had then observed that the prosecution would revive its case against these accused -- who have been declared s ‘Proclaimed Offenders’ vide order dated 12.07.2016 -- when they are arrested by the police.The operation against the AQIS module had kicked off after special cell received information that the terrorist outfit was trying to set up its base in India. ""The objective is to disturb its peace and tranquility for which its module became active in Western UP, particularly in District Sambhal. The tip was developed and surveillance mounted to ascertain the identity of suspects visiting foreign countries including Iran, Turkey and Pakistan in a suspicious manner,"" recalled a senior investigator.During investigation, the arrested suspects spilled the beans on Usman and others and also revealed the identity of elusive AQIS chief Maulana Asim Umar as Sanaul Haq, a resident of Deepa Sarai in Sambhal.""One of the accused Zafar Masood had visited Pakistan in November-December, 1999 pretending to be doing the business of 'Pan/Kattha' and met Asim Umar at a training camp named Harkat-e-Mujahidin .

Jobs of over 20,000 federal employees are under jeopardy after US President Donald Trump ordered the heads of agencies across the government to start firing employees who were still within their probationary period.Some federal staff members facing termination were given a mere 30 minutes to collect their items and depart from government premises. Moreover, the firing was done via Microsoft Teams group calls or pre-recorded messages.Some were told that they would be laid off over email but never received such mails. Following Donald Trump's directive, federal organisations were instructed to dismiss primarily probationary personnel, with some being hastily escorted out, according to the Washington Post.This comes after intensified cost-cutting measures were launched by President Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), under Elon Musk's leadership, including potential elimination of entire governmental departments.Here are the federal agencies which have started purging workersThe Interior Department dismissed about 2,300 employees following directives from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). These employees were on probationary status, meaning they were recently hired, the Hill reported.The department, which oversees national parks, tribal affairs, endangered species, and energy production on federal lands, is now led by Doug Burgum, former governor of North Dakota and a former GOP presidential candidate, who was confirmed earlier this month.Department of veterans affairs (VA) laid off over 1,000 new employees as part of a wave of federal government cuts. The firings affected probationary employees with less than two years of service.According to the VA, the layoffs are expected to save over $98 million annually, with the savings redirected toward healthcare and benefits for veterans.The Environmental protection agency (EPA) terminated nearly 400 employees after receiving the OPM directive. Under the leadership of newly confirmed Administrator Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.), the agency explained that these layoffs followed a thorough review in line with Trump's executive orders.This comes just days after the EPA put over 160 employees from the Office of environmental justice on leave, a team responsible for addressing pollution in vulnerable communities.The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is laying off nearly all of its 5,200 probationary employees, although some with specialized skills may remain. This includes up to 1,300 employees from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).Additionally, two key staff members from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) are leaving. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the environmental lawyer and former presidential candidate, was confirmed to lead HHS this week, despite controversy over his previous anti-vaccine views and stance on abortion.Over 100 employees were let go at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) following the OPM directive. Most of those terminated were probationary employees. Jonathan McKernan has recently been appointed as the new chair of the agency, replacing acting director Russell Vought, who also serves as the director of the Office of Management and Budget.However, a federal judge blocked the administration from proceeding with firings without cause, as part of a legal agreement reached with the National Treasury Employees Union.The US forest service, part of the department of agriculture (USDA), laid off more than 2,400 employees, about 10% of its workforce. The USDA manages nearly 200 million acres of land.These layoffs followed the Senate’s confirmation of Brooke Rollins to lead the agency, continuing the rapid pace of confirmation for President Trump’s Cabinet picks.The education department fired at least 30 employees after the OPM directive, with more cuts expected. These layoffs came shortly after the Institute of Education Sciences, the department’s research arm, canceled over 160 contracts due to funding cuts.Education Secretary nominee Linda McMahon recently pledged to work with Congress to potentially abolish the department, with plans to move essential programs to other parts of the government.Small business administrationIn line with President Trump’s executive order, more than 100 probationary employees at the Small Business Administration (SBA) were terminated. These layoffs followed earlier erroneous termination notices, which were later rectified by the president’s directive.Kelly Loeffler, President Trump’s nominee to lead the SBA, is expected to be confirmed soon despite potential plans to reduce the agency’s size.",President Donald Trump ordered the heads of agencies across the government to start firing employees who were still within their probationary period. Some federal staff members facing termination were given a mere 30 minutes to collect their items and depart from government premises. This comes after intensified cost-cutting measures were launched by President Trump's Department of Government Efficiency.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118292033,imgsize-1577983,width-400,resizemode-4/118292033.jpg"

His mother, grandmother, and girlfriend were freed in November 2023, but Sasha remained in captivity while his father was killed in the attacks.""I’m incredibly relieved to share the news that our AWS teammate, Sasha Troufanov, who had been held hostage since the October 7, 2023, attacks in Israel, has been released from captivity,"" Jassy wrote in a message to Amazon employees.In his message, Jassy detailed the company's efforts to assist Troufanov’s family, sharing that a team of Amazon experts had worked ""behind the scenes"" to help secure his release. However, Jassy explained that Amazon had refrained from commenting publicly on the situation ""for fear that we would negatively impact their ability to be released or how they were treated in captivity.""Amazon faced criticism for its silence on Troufanov's abduction earlier in May 2024 after it was revealed that he worked for the company. Many speculated that Amazon’s low profile was a strategic move to protect its brand. However, hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, a vocal supporter of Israel, defended Amazon's decision to keep quiet.""It’s been an extremely trying time for everybody who knows and cares for Sasha — a lot of angst and feelings of helplessness. But, it can’t approach what Sasha and his family have been through, and we will continue to support them and do everything we can to help them heal,"" Jassy wrote in his message.He also said that his ""heart goes out to everyone impacted by the war"" and expressed hope that there would be a ""long-term peaceful path.""Troufanov’s release came on Saturday, alongside two other hostages, Iair Horn and Sagui Dekel-Chen, an American citizen. However, just days before their release, Hamas had threatened to delay it over alleged ceasefire violations by Israel.US President Donald Trump had weighed in on the situation, demanding that Israel should ""let all hell break out"" if Hamas did not release all remaining hostages by a specified deadline.Hamas ultimately reversed its threat on Thursday, confirming that the release would proceed as planned.The release took place amid a fragile ceasefire agreement reached between Israel and Hamas on January 19, 2025. Under this deal, 33 hostages were to be freed in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners, bringing an end to over 15 months of war.","Sasha Troufanov, an electrical engineer with Amazon Web Services, was abducted during the deadly October 7 attacks in Israel.

Black Hawk helicopter crew may read wrong altitude before crash and missed radio communications: Investigators,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/black-hawk-helicopter-crew-may-read-wrong-altitude-before-crash-and-missed-radio-communications-investigators/articleshow/118283576.cms,"The crew of an Army helicopter, which collided with an American Airlines near Washington DC, may have read the wrong altitude before the crash and missed radio communications, according to the National Transportation Safety Board.A passenger jet and a Black Hawk helicopter that collided in midair on the night of January 29 and crashed into the Potomac River near Reagan National Airport near Washington, DC, claiming the lives of 67 people.NTSB chief Jennifer Homendy told explained that crucial instructions were possibly missed due to overlapping radio transmissions. The helicopter crew, conducting a night vision goggle certification flight, might have missed important tower communications about runway changes.“That transmission was interrupted -– it was stepped on,” she said, leaving them unable to hear the words “pass behind the” because the helicopter's microphone key was pressed at the same moment.The helicopter pilots may have also missed part of another communication, when the tower said the jet was shifting to a different runway, she said.Homendy said the helicopter was on a “check"" flight that night where the pilot was undergoing an annual test and a test on using night vision goggles. Investigators believe the crew was wearing night vision goggles throughout the flight.It will take more than a year to get the final NTSB report on the collision, and Homendy warned reporters that many issues were still being probed.“We're only a couple weeks out,” from the crash, she said. “We have a lot of work to do.”The investigation revealed the Black Hawk was flying at approximately 325 feet, exceeding its 200-foot limit. Discrepancies in altitude readings were noted, with the pilot reporting 300 feet whilst the instructor indicated 400 feet. The helicopter's radio altimeter recorded 278 feet at impact.Aviation experts, including William Waldock from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University and retired pilot John Cox, provided insights about radio communication issues and visual separation protocols. Cox emphasised that the helicopter crew had accepted responsibility for maintaining visual separation with the airliner.The Army crew members were identified as Capt. Rebecca M. Lobach, Staff Sgt. Ryan Austin O'Hara, and Chief Warrant Officer 2 Andrew Loyd Eaves. The American Airlines pilot was Jonathan Campos. The passengers included hunters, students, parents, and members of the Skating Club of Boston returning from a development camp.President Donald Trump made unsubstantiated claims about the crash, initially blaming the helicopter's altitude and later criticising the air traffic control system.

Harnai lies some 160 km east of Quetta, the capital of Balochistan province.Authorities said they were investigating the attack, with officials saying evidence was being collected and that preliminary investigation showed the explosive material had been planted on the roadside.No group has claimed responsibility for the attack yet. But the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), a militant organisation fighting for independence, is active in the restive province that borders Afghanistan and Iran. The group usually targets security forces as well as Pakistanis from other provinces. Local media reported that most of the workers killed or injured came from KP’s Puran village.The BLA has also targeted Chinese projects in the region, arguing that foreigners are exploiting resource-rich Balochistan while the impoverished residents are left behind.Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif responded to the incident by reaffirming his commitment to aggressively working to eradicate terrorism in the country.",A bomb planted by the road exploded as a pickup truck carrying coal mine workers went by.

Before that, at least 300 Pakistanis had drowned in a migrant boat that sank off Greece in June 2023, with Italy their intended destination.In a travel alert, Pakistan’s Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) has identified Libya as one of 15 transit countries used for human trafficking.Each year, thousands of Pakistanis pay traffickers large sums for risky and illegal journeys to Europe, hoping to find work and send money back to their families. Many also take these perilous routes to escape conflicts and religious persecution.Pakistani authorities claim human smugglers send migrants seeking illegal entry into Europe to Libya, located around 300km from Italy. From there, they either take them by boat to Europe or relocate them to the coastal cities of Morocco and Mauritania in west Africa.On Monday, UN’s International Organisation for Migration (IOM) said it was “deeply alarmed” by the dozens of migrants’ bodies found in mass graves in southeastern Libya.

ISLAMABAD: At least 16 Pakistanis died and 10 others are unaccounted for after a boat carrying dozens of Europe-bound migrants sank at the weekend off the coast of Libya , officials said Tuesday.The ministry of foreign affairs said that 33 of the 37 survivors were in Libyan police custody and one was being treated at a hospital. An estimated 65 people were on the boat, it said.Prime minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed his deep grief and sorrow for those lost in the capsizing in Marsa Dela port in the western city of Zawiya.Sharif ordered the foreign ministry to complete the process of identifying the victims and provide assistance to those affected. He also ordered action against those involved ""in heinous acts like human trafficking,"" according to a statement.Most of the victims came from Kurram, a district in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province bordering Afghanistan , where hundreds of people have been killed in recent years in sectarian clashes.""People try to travel to Europe through illegal means because of unemployment"" at home, said Javed Hussain, a nephew of Shehzad Hussain, one of the victims. He said mourners were gathering at the homes of those who perished in the latest tragedy.In January, authorities said dozens of Pakistanis died when a boat capsized off West Africa. Some of the survivors later accused smugglers of killing 43 migrants in a dispute over payment. Pakistan has since confirmed the deaths of 13 of its nationals.Hundreds of Pakistanis die every year while trying to reach Europe by land and sea with the help of human smugglers. They also use dangerous land and sea routes to reach Europe in an effort to find jobs.Libya, which has borders with six nations and a long shore on the Mediterranean, was plunged into chaos following a Nato-backed uprising that toppled and killed longtime leader Moammar Gadhafi in 2011. Since then, the oil-rich country has emerged as the dominant transit point for migrants fleeing war and poverty in Africa and the Middle East for Europe.At least 674 migrants were reported dead and more than 1,000 missing off Libya in 2024, according to the International Organization for Migration's missing migrants project. More than 21,700 migrants were intercepted and returned to the chaos-stricken country.In 2023, the IOM reported 962 migrants dead and 1,563 missing off Libya. Around 17,200 migrants were intercepted and returned to Libya that year, it said.Those who are returned are held in government-run detention centers rife with abuses, including forced labor, beatings, rapes and torture - practices that amount to crimes against humanity, according to UN-commissioned investigators. The abuse often accompanies attempts to extort money from the families of the imprisoned migrants before releasing them or allowing them to leave Libya on traffickers' boats to Europe.","At least 16 Pakistanis died and 10 others are unaccounted for after a boat carrying dozens of Europe-bound migrants sank off Libya.

The CPI ranks 180 countries and territories by their perceived levels of public sector corruption on a scale of zero (highly corrupt) to 100 (very clean), Dawn.com reported.The CPI report is released annually by Transparency International Berlin.Transparency International Pakistan (TIP) has no role either in the collection of data or the calculation of the country's score, TIP explains.The score for Pakistan also reduced by two points from 29 in CPI 2023 to 27 in CPI 2024.According to a Transparency International document listing Pakistan's CPI ranking and scores from 1996 to 2024, which was seen by Dawn.com, the country's score in the past 10 years has ranged between 27 and 33 points (a higher score indicating less corruption).Since 2012, when the index changed to a scoring scale of 100 from 10, Pakistan's score rose from 27 to 33 in 2018 but declined consecutively back to 27 last year.Statistics from the past show that in 1996, Pakistan ranked only second-last out of 54 countries part of the index back then, with a score of 1/10.From 1997 to 2011, the country's score went back and forth, reaching as high as 2.7 in 1998 and dropping as low as 2.1 in 2004 and 2005.According to TIP chair Justice (retired) Zia Perwez, the scores of all countries in the region except Oman, China, Turkiye and Mongolia declined. The downslide for the region showed that Pakistan was one of the countries holding up against the overall trend in the region.Global corruption levels remained alarmingly high, with efforts to reduce them faltering, according to the CPI report, which exposed serious corruption levels across the globe, with more than two-thirds of countries scoring below 50 out of 100.Almost 6.8 billion people live in countries with CPI scores under 50 - equivalent to 85 per cent of the world population of 8 billion.For the seventh year in a row, Denmark obtained the highest score on the index (90) and was closely followed by Finland (88) and Singapore (84).Countries with the lowest scores were mostly fragile and conflict-affected ones like South Sudan (8), Somalia (9), Venezuela (10), Syria (12), Libya (13), Eritrea (13), Yemen (13) and Equatorial Guinea (13).While the CPI noted that the Middle East and North Africa's rising average score was a ""reason for optimism"", it pointed out that it was the first increase in over a decade and only by one point - to 39 out of 100.According to Transparency International, the top-scoring region was Western Europe and the European Union, but its score ""decreased overall for the second year in a row - many leaders are serving business interests rather than the common good and laws are often poorly enforced"".""While Asia Pacific does have a range of improving countries, its average score is decreasing, as vicious cycles of corruption and climate change impacts take their toll,"" it added.Over a quarter of the countries in the sample (47) got their lowest score yet on the index, including Austria (67), Bangladesh (23), Brazil (34), Cuba (41), France (67), Germany (75), Haiti (16), Hungary (41), Iran (23), Mexico (26), Russia (22), South Sudan (8), Switzerland (81), the United States (65) and Venezuela (10).Over the past five years, seven countries have significantly improved their scores in the index: These include Cote d'Ivoire (45), the Dominican Republic (36), Kosovo (44), Kuwait (46), the Maldives (38), Moldova (43) and Zambia (39).The global average on the index remained unchanged at 43, highlighting the need for urgent action against corruption and warning of a critical global obstacle to implementing successful climate action.",Pakistan's ranking on the corruption perception index (CPI) has dropped by 2 spots from 133 in 2023 to 135 in 2024. The CPI ranks 180 countries and territories by their perceived levels of public sector corruption. Denmark obtained the highest score on the index (90) and was closely followed by Finland (88) and Singapore (84),"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118143924,imgsize-229061,width-400,resizemode-4/118143924.jpg"

Pakistani lawyers stage protest against high-level meeting of constitutional body to pick eight SC judges,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistani-lawyers-stage-protest-against-high-level-meeting-of-constitutional-body-to-pick-eight-sc-judges/articleshow/118118105.cms,"Representative image (Image credits: ANI)

ISLAMABAD: Hundreds of lawyers on Monday staged protests in Pakistan's national capital against a high-level meeting of a constitutional body with the agenda to appoint at least eight judges of the supreme court. The judicial commission of Pakistan (JCP) meeting was being held despite opposition by four apex court judges, the legal fraternity, resistance by opposition the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf and controversy over the recent transfer of judges to the Islamabad high court (IHC), which was opposed by five IHC judges.The JCP, a top body empowered to approve judicial appointments, will finalise appointments for eight vacant supreme court judges.Lawyers gathered at various locations in Islamabad, with the lawyers' action committee staging a protest near D-Chowk. But police responded by closing several key entry points to the Red Zone, which houses key buildings, including the supreme court.Dozens of protestors gathered at Serena Chowk as they were stopped from going to the supreme court due to the closure of the Red Zone. They chanted ""Azaadi"" (freedom) and ""Lawyers' unity zindabad"" (long live lawyers' unity). They were also holding a banner written in Urdu and reading "" 26th constitutional amendment unacceptable"".Clashes were also reported between lawyers and police when they tried to enter the Red Zone. However, there was no report of any arrest or injury during the protest.The protest led to the suspension of metro bus services on multiple routes between Islamabad and Rawalpindi, causing significant inconvenience for commuters. The closure of the Red Zone has caused traffic disruptions, leading to heavy congestion on different roads in the capital.Earlier, the legal fraternity in the country was already expressing concerns against the new appointments and transfers following the controversial 26th constitutional amendment passed last year.The lawyers' representatives had held a convention at the Islamabad district courts, opposing the 26th amendment and demanding the cancellation of the JCP meeting.They also announced on February 3 to protest against the transfer of three high court judges to the IHC but it could not elicit a widespread response. The Karachi bar association had supported the strike call by staying away.Last month, the Lahore high court bar association (LHCBA) moved an application before the apex court through advocate Muhammad Waqar Rana, seeking postponement of the JCP meeting.The JCP earlier this month asked all high courts to send a list of five senior judges from each for consideration for the appointment of eight of them to the supreme court.Initially, the IHC had forwarded the names of three judges - chief justice Aamer Farooq, justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani and justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb - to the JCP because justices Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri and Babar Sattar did not meet the minimum requirement of five years of service.However, as justice Sarfraz Dogar was made the IHC senior puisne judge following his transfer there from the Lahore high court, his name has also been sent to the JCP.Days before justice Dogar's name was added, five judges of the IHC approached chief justice Yahya Afridi and IHC chief justice Aamer Farooq to reclaim their seniority.Separately, four SC judges, senior puisne judge justice Mansoor Ali Shah, justice Munib Akhtar, justice Ayesha Malik and justice Athar Minallah, in a letter to the chief justice showed concerns last week and are also seeking the postponement of today's JCP session until a decision is made on the petitions against the 26th Amendment.The opposition PTI party in a letter to the chief justice on Sunday asked to postpone the commission's meeting.The 13-member JCP is led by the chief justice and includes four judges of the apex court, as well as parliamentarians from both the treasury and opposition and others.The lawyers and opposition allege that the government was trying to 'pack' the top judiciary with hand-picked judges to influence the fate of political cases, a concern rejected by the government.","Hundreds of lawyers stage protests in Islamabad against high-level meeting of constitutional body.

Policemen at the checkpost offered stiff resistance in an encounter which lasted two hours, following which the terrorists fled,” the provincial police said in a statement.Pakistan has experienced an escalation in militancy in KP, adjacent to Afghanistan, following the collapse of a tenuous truce between TTP and the state in Nov 2022.Pakistani authorities have linked the surge in militant violence to cross-border incursions from Afghanistan, alleging that the Kabul administration is facilitating TTP fighters, a claim Afghan authorities refute. Most of these assaults have been directed at security and law-enforcement personnel, although civilians and govt officials have also been impacted.In KP’s Dera Ismail Khan district last week, four soldiers were killed by gunfire and an improvised explosive device (IED) unleashed by terrorists.In Balochistan, another restive province in Pakistan’s south, 18 soldiers were killed in an attack by terrorists earlier this month.Islamabad think-tank Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) has described 2024 as the most lethal year for security forces in a decade, with a minimum of 685 military and police fatalities resulting from 444 terror attacks.Alongside such attacks, militants have stepped up targeted killings and kidnappings of officials in KP and Balochistan.","Nearly a dozen militants stormed a police check post at Karak district in Pakistan’s restive northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province.

ISLAMABAD : The UN refugees and migration agencies on Wednesday expressed their concern over Pakistan 's decision to deport thousands of Afghan refugees awaiting relocation to the United States and elsewhere.The UN refugee agency, UNHCR , and the international organization for migration in a statement said they were seeking clarification from Pakistan, which said last week it would deport the refugees back to Afghanistan unless their cases were processed quickly by the countries that had agreed to take them in.About 20,000 Afghans were approved for resettlement in the US under a program that helps people at risk because of their work with the American government, media, aid agencies and rights groups. They were among tens of thousands of Afghans who fled to neighboring Pakistan after their country fell to the Taliban in 2021.However, they were left in limbo after President Donald Trump paused US refugee programs last month.""A UNHCR-issued non-return advisory has been in place since 2021, calling for a suspension of forced returns of Afghan nationals from any country regardless of their status,"" the joint UNHCR-IOM statement said.Pakistan's prime minister Shehbaz Sharif last week gave the green light to evict Afghans without papers from the cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi before March 31, in preparation for deportation if they were not relocated to their host countries.UNHCR and IOM said they are especially concerned for Afghan nationals who face a risk of harm upon return, such as ethnic and religious minorities, women and girls, journalists, human rights activists, and members of artistic professions like musicians and others.It said since January 1, 2025, an uptick in arrests of Afghan nationals in Islamabad and Rawalpindi has caused significant distress, with reports of Afghan nationals of various documentation statuses being rounded up.The Trump administration also announced the US refugee admissions program would be suspended from January 27 for at least three months. It has shocked Afghans who were hoping to travel to the United States soon.Afghans in Pakistan have been virtually living in hiding since 2023 when a crackdown began on foreigners who are in the country without proper documentation. An estimated 800,000 Afghans have either gone back voluntarily or been deported since despite criticism from UN agencies, rights groups and the Taliban.Besides thousands of Afghans who are living in Pakistan and awaiting travel to host countries, there are around 1.45 million Afghan nationals registered with UNHCR as refugees in Pakistan as well but their stay has been extended until June.In the statement, UNHCR and IOM urged ""Pakistan to implement any relocation measures with due consideration for human rights standards, including due process, and the legal status of proof of registration (POR) and afghan citizen card (ACC) holders, who have resided in Pakistan for an extended period of time"".""Pakistan has a proud tradition of hosting refugees, saving millions of lives.

DHAKA: The foreign ministry of Bangladesh on Thursday said the Yunus government will send a ""formal reminder"" to India regarding the extradition of deposed PM Sheikh Hasina when it deems the timing is appropriate. ""It (the reminder) will be sent when the political leadership feels it is the right time,"" ministry spokesperson Mohammad Rafiqul Alam told reporters. Pressed for details, he emphasised that the matter involves both political considerations and diplomatic procedures .Alam confirmed that Bangladesh had formally requested Hasina's extradition in Dec, submitting a set of relevant documents along with a diplomatic letter (note verbale) to India.On whether Bangladesh had provided an arrest warrant to facilitate the extradition, Alam said all required materials, received from the relevant ministries, had been included in the note verbale. When asked about the timing of a possible reminder to India, Alam reiterated that it would be a ""diplomatic and political decision"" and that govt would proceed accordingly. Alam said despite Bangladesh's formal request, India is yet to respond. ""We continue to expect a response from New Delhi ,"" he said.India's foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal has confirmed that New Delhi received Bangladesh's extradition request.

Taliban's security challenges

One killed and three others suffered injuries in a suicide attack on Afghan ministry of urban development and housing on Thursday.""The suicide attacker wanted to enter the ministry and one of the mujahideen (security forces) shot him and then in the result of the explosion another person near him was killed and three injured,"" interior ministry spokesman Abdul Mateen Qani told AFP.Although violence in Afghanistan has significantly decreased since the Taliban reclaimed power in 2021, the Islamic State (IS) group continues to launch deadly attacks challenging their rule. IS has previously targeted Taliban officials, foreign diplomats, and civilians in Afghanistan.A doctor at Kabul's Emergency Hospital, speaking anonymously, said that ""five to six injured"" individuals had been brought to the facility for treatment. However, official casualty figures often differ from those reported by medical personnel on the ground.There was no immediate claim of responsibility for Thursday's attack, but IS has a history of carrying out high-profile bombings in Afghanistan. In December, the group claimed responsibility for a suicide attack that killed Khalil Ur-Rahman Haqqani, the Taliban government's minister for refugees, inside his Kabul office. Just a day before Thursday's attack, IS also claimed responsibility for a deadly assault on a northern Afghan bank, which left eight people dead. The attack specifically targeted Taliban employees collecting their salaries.IS-Khorasan, the Afghan chapter of the Islamic State founded in 2015, has been behind some of the deadliest attacks in the country. The group gained global attention in August 2021 when it bombed Kabul airport during the chaotic US evacuation, killing around 170 Afghans and 13 American service members.Since taking power, the Taliban government has declared security its highest priority, claiming success in curbing IS activities through an extensive crackdown. However, IS remains a persistent threat, continuing to target government officials and civilians alike.Security forces frequently seal off attack sites, making independent verification of casualty figures difficult. The Taliban maintains that its counterterrorism measures have weakened IS, but Thursday's bombing highlights the ongoing security challenges the administration faces.","One killed and three others injured in suicide attack on Afghan ministry of urban development and housing.

UN reports rights abuses in B'desh 2024 protest response, estimates 1,400 killed

DHAKA: A UN report released on Wednesday found that human rights abuses were inflicted on members of Bangladesh's Hindu, Ahmadiyya Muslim and indigenous communities during the anti-discrimination protests that led to Sheikh Hasina govt's fall and its aftermath in 204.While 100 arrests related to attacks on distinct religious & indigenous groups have reportedly been made, perpetrators of many other acts of revenge violence and targeted attacks on such groups still enjoy impunity, UN Human Rights Office said. After fall of the govt, ""widespread attacks were reported against Hindu homes, businesses and places of worship"", it said. The report validates India's repeated claims of targeted attacks on Hindus & temples.Widespread attacks were reported against Hindu homes, businesses, and places of worship, especially in rural and historically tense areas such as Thakurgaon, Lalmonirhat and Dinajpur, as well as other places such as Sylhet, Khulna, and Rangpur"", said the UN report titled 'Human Rights Violations and Abuses related to Protests of July and August 2024 in Bangladesh'.These destructions were especially prevalent in areas perceived to be sympathetic to the Awami League as Hindus have often been stereotypically associated with this political faction, it added. The report, based on the deaths reported by various credible sources, also estimated that as many as 1,400 people may have been killed during July 1-Aug 15 last year and thousands were injured, the vast majority of whom were shot by Bangladesh's security forces.""Bangladesh's former govt, security and intelligence services, alongside violent elements associated with Awami League, systematically engaged in a range of serious human rights violations during last year's student-led protests,"" it added.Former PM Sheikh Hasina left the country on Aug 5 and Muhammad Yunus-led interim govt began its journey three days later. The report released by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights documented ""troubling instances"" of retaliatory killings and revenge violence during the student-led protests. It stated that security and intelligence services ""systematically engaged"" in rights violations that could amount to crimes against humanity.UN Human Rights chief Volker Turk described the response as a ""calculated and well-coordinated strategy"" by the Hasina govt to retain power amid mass opposition. ""Hundreds of extrajudicial killings, arbitrary arrests, detentions, and torture"" were carried out with political leadership's knowledge and coordination, he added.Director of Rights and Risks Analysis Group (RRAG) Suhas Chakma criticised the report for not identifying individual officers responsible for the carnage, citing the limitations of Yunus's interim govt, which restricted the investigation period from July 5 to Aug 15, 2024.The report also includes recommendations to reform Bangladesh's security and justice sectors. ""The interim govt must ensure that violent crimes targeting supporters of Awami League, police officers, or members of distinct religious and indigenous groups are promptly and independently investigated with due diligence and that identified perpetrators are brought to justice,"" it said.","UN reports rights abuses in B'desh 2024 protest response, estimates 1,400 killed. 100 arrests related to attacks on distinct religious & indigenous groups have reportedly been made. perpetrators of many other acts of revenge violence and targeted attacks on such groups still enjoy impunity.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118196706,imgsize-566875,width-400,resizemode-4/118196706.jpg"

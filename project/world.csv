Here are 10 key facts about Charlie Kirk assassination case:

Robinson allegedly confessed and left a chilling note



Was the attack premeditated?

Discord at the centre of investigation



A ‘leftist ideology’ and online radicalisation



What we know about his partner

Details from Tyler Robinson's childhood

Electronic devices and ammunition offer further clues



Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty



The Fallout: National mourning and political repercussions



Security questions and a nation on edge







Six days after conservative activist Charlie Kirk was shot and killed while speaking at Utah Valley University, investigators are piecing together a clearer picture of the man accused of carrying out the assassination. Tyler Robinson, 22, was arrested soon after the rooftop attack and now faces the prospect of a capital murder charge.As the FBI and local authorities continue to piece together Robinson’s motive and movements, new revelations paint a chilling portrait of a quiet, intelligent young man whose ideology reportedly turned extreme.FBI Director Kash Patel revealed that Tyler Robinson allegedly sent a text message before the shooting, stating: “I had the opportunity to take out Charlie Kirk and I was going to do that.” When asked why, he reportedly said: “Some hatred cannot be negotiated with.” According to Patel, Robinson also made online admissions and “essentially admitted” to the shooting through witness interviews. Investigators recovered remnants of a destroyed note in which he claimed he was going to carry out the attack.Robinson allegedly shot Kirk from a rooftop hundreds of yards away from Utah Valley University’s campus, where Kirk was addressing a large crowd. Law enforcement found a rifle wrapped in a towel and a screwdriver near the scene. DNA evidence on both items matched Robinson, according to FBI Director Patel. Investigators also recovered engraved bullets containing taunting messages, including one that read: “Hey, fascist! Catch!”Discord, a messaging platform popular with gamers, has become a focal point of the investigation.Authorities say Robinson communicated with others via Discord about retrieving a weapon from a “drop point” and had conversations involving bullet engraving. However, Discord officials told Fox News Digital that these messages did not take place on their platform and that they found no evidence Robinson used Discord to plan the attack. Nonetheless, the FBI is examining Robinson’s entire digital footprint, including chat logs, phone messages, and social media activity.Utah Governor Spencer Cox said Robinson's family and friends described him as politically shifting “to the left” in recent years and spending increasing time in the “dark corners of the internet.” Authorities believe his ideology played a role, although a clear motive remains unconfirmed. “There clearly was a leftist ideology,” said Cox on NBC’s Meet the Press, noting that Kirk’s controversial stances, particularly on transgender issues, may have made him a target.Robinson's romantic partner is transgender, a detail some political figures have pointed to as a possible reason behind the assassination, given Kirk’s vocal stance against transgender rights. However, authorities have not confirmed any direct connection between Robinson’s personal relationship and the motive for the killing. Utah’s public safety commissioner said the partner has been “incredibly cooperative” and had no knowledge of the plan.Robinson grew up in St. George, Utah, in what appears to be a stable and outdoors-oriented family. He was a high school honours student, scoring in the 99th percentile nationally on standardised tests. He was accepted into Utah State University on an academic scholarship but only completed one semester. At the time of the shooting, he was a third-year student in an electrical apprenticeship programme at Dixie Technical College. His family has not commented publicly.FBI agents seized multiple electronic devices from Robinson’s home, including laptops, gaming systems, and mobile phones. According to Director Patel, investigators are conducting a “reverse daisy chain analysis” of everyone Robinson contacted. Ammunition found at the scene featured anti-fascist engravings and meme-culture references. Prosecutors have not ruled out additional federal charges, depending on what further evidence is uncovered.Utah prosecutors are expected to indict Robinson for first-degree murder and other felonies, including obstruction of justice and unlawful discharge of a firearm. State Attorney General Pam Bondi has stated her office will pursue the death penalty, describing it as “very real in Utah,” where firing squads remain a legal form of execution. Federal prosecutors are also weighing potential charges.Kirk’s assassination has triggered a wave of grief across the country. Vigils were held in Washington D.C., Arizona, and Utah. At Utah Valley University, students created a makeshift memorial of flowers and flags. Vice President JD Vance, a personal friend of Kirk, hosted an emotional tribute on The Charlie Kirk Show. Meanwhile, public workers, teachers, and even media commentators have faced consequences for mocking or criticising Kirk’s death, sparking a national conversation about free speech and political civility.The attack has raised serious questions about the adequacy of security at political events, especially on college campuses. Kirk often insisted on being close to students and the public, with varying levels of protection. As more details emerge, officials and security experts are reviewing protocols. FBI Director Patel stressed that authorities are still investigating whether Robinson acted entirely alone or had support. Utah officials said they are examining every possible contact Robinson had in the lead-up to the assassination.","Tyler Robinson, 22, allegedly shot conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University.

Setback for Trump? Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook to stay in role ahead of rate meeting; appeals court steps in,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/setback-for-trump-federal-reserve-governor-lisa-cook-to-stay-in-role-ahead-of-rate-meeting-appeals-court-steps-in/articleshow/123911273.cms,"Donald Trump, Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook

U.S. Dollar CRASHES Hours After Trump's Unprecedented Move Against Fed Governor Cook | Details





A federal appeals court has ruled that Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook can remain in her post, allowing her to take part in this week’s closely watched interest rate meeting, despite President Donald Trump’s attempt to remove her from the board. The decision from the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit came on Monday, hours after Trump announced Cook’s dismissal in a letter posted on Truth Social, accusing her of mortgage fraud.“In light of your deceitful and potentially criminal conduct in a financial matter, [Americans] cannot and I do not have such confidence in your integrity,” Trump wrote. “I have determined that there is sufficient cause to remove you from your position.” Cook, the first Black woman to serve on the Fed’s board, has denied the allegations and pledged not to be “bullied to step down.” She has also filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, arguing that the accusations are unrelated to her role at the central bank and remain unproven.The allegations originated with Bill Pulte, head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, who claimed Cook had listed more than one home as her primary residence in 2021 to secure favourable mortgage terms.The Justice Department has since opened an investigation, with subpoenas issued in Georgia and Michigan, and reports suggesting a grand jury in Atlanta is examining the case. Cook has not been charged, and her legal filing describes the allegations as a pretext to force her out and open a seat for Trump to fill.Legal experts say the case raises fundamental questions about the independence of the Federal Reserve. Governors can only be removed “for cause,” a standard that historically covers proven misconduct or neglect. Trump’s move marks the first attempt by a president to fire a sitting Fed governor in the institution’s 112-year history, and observers expect the dispute could reach the Supreme Court.The legal fight comes as the Fed begins a two-day policy meeting, with markets anticipating a rate cut of at least 25 basis points. Investors are watching closely for signals of further easing as the US economy slows and trade talks with China continue.","Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook can remain in her post, despite President Donald Trump's attempt to remove her from the board.

Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, has been left reeling after the body of a student, Demartravion “Trey” Reed, was found hanging from a tree on campus, Fox News reported. The 21-year-old, from Grenada, Mississippi, was discovered on Monday morning in the central part of campus near the pickleball courts, according to University Police Chief Michael Peeler. He confirmed that Reed’s death is under investigation but said there is no evidence of foul play and no ongoing threat to campus safety.In a statement, Delta State President Dr Dan Ennis said the community was “deeply saddened by this loss” and that he had spoken to Reed’s family to express the university’s “heartbreak.” He added that counselling services were being made available to students, faculty and staff. The Mississippi Bureau of Investigation, the Bolivar County Sheriff’s Office, Cleveland Police Department, and the Bolivar County Coroner are all involved in the inquiry, with an autopsy set to be conducted.Fox 13 Memphis reported that Reed’s body was discovered around 7am on September 15. Chief Peeler told reporters that while the circumstances were tragic, students should know the campus remains safe.“I just want to confirm, this is a safe campus. Delta State University is a beautiful place to be. It’s just unfortunate this loss that comes heavily to our campus,” he said.The discovery prompted the immediate closure of the campus, with all classes and events cancelled. The Independent reported that celebrations marking the university’s 100th anniversary, scheduled for Monday, were also called off. Officials said further updates would be shared “when appropriate” and urged compassion for Reed’s loved ones during what they described as a “difficult time.”The university has not confirmed when normal operations will resume.

JD Vance hosts 'The Charlie Kirk Show': US VP lashes out at liberals; recalls Erika’s tribute,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/jd-vance-hosts-the-charlie-kirk-show-us-vp-lashes-out-at-liberals-recalls-erikas-tribute/articleshow/123911323.cms,"Trump Unleashes Crackdown After Kirk’s Murder: Visa Bans, Mass Firings, Military Probes Sweep US





US Vice-President JD Vance has said that national unity is impossible with people who celebrate the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk , warning that such behaviour fuels further political violence.Speaking as guest host of The Charlie Kirk Show on Monday, Vance said: “Call them out, and hell, call their employer. We don't believe in political violence, but we do believe in civility.”The vice-president took over presenting duties from his ceremonial office at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, with the programme livestreamed into the White House press briefing room. It was the first episode of the podcast since Kirk, 31, was fatally shot in the neck while moderating a debate at Utah Valley University last week.Vance, who flew Kirk’s body home to Arizona aboard Air Force Two, said he was “filling in for somebody who cannot be filled in for”. He recounted conversations with Kirk’s widow Erika, describing him as “a kind, loving husband”, and admitted her words had inspired him to “be a better husband and… a better father”.In his remarks, Vance directly challenged those making light of Kirk’s assassination. “There is no unity with the people who celebrate Charlie Kirk's assassination,” he said.“There is no unity with someone who lies about what Charlie Kirk said in order to excuse his murder… And there is no unity with the people who fund these articles, who pay the salaries of these terrorist sympathisers who argue that Charlie Kirk, a loving husband and father, deserved a shot to the neck because he spoke words with which they disagree. ”He added: “I’m desperate for our country to be united in condemnation of the actions and the ideas that killed my friend. I want it so badly that I will tell you a difficult truth. We can only have it with people who acknowledge that political violence is unacceptable.”Other Republicans have echoed calls for accountability. Florida congressman Randy Fine said he would “demand their firing, defunding, and licence revocation”, while South Carolina’s Nancy Mace urged federal funding to be cut from universities that refuse to act.Vance, who described Kirk as a close friend and mentor, credited him with helping President Donald Trump’s re-election and with shaping the administration. “If it weren't for Charlie Kirk, I would not be the vice president of the United States,” he said.","US Vice-President JD Vance said national unity is impossible with people who celebrate the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

Charlie Kirk Predicted His Own Death? Trump Ally’s Old Post On ‘Left-Wing Murderers’ Goes Viral

Who is Tyler Robinson ?







Matt Robinson, believed to be the father of 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, was hailed as the 'father of justice' as he reportedly turned his son in after Tyler allegedly killed Charlie Kirk. The New York Post reported that Tyler confessed to his father but was not ready to surrender. He even threatened to kill himself rather than surrender to the authorities when his father wanted to call the police. But his parents convinced him to speak with their youth minister, who also happens to be a US Marshal Service fugitive task force officer. The minister then called a deputy with the federal agency, and the FBI took Robinson into custody.Earlier in the day, US President Donald Trump confirmed that the Charlie Kirk shooter is in custody. “I think, with a high degree of certainty, we have him,” Trump told “Fox & Friends” during a live interview at the cable giant’s Manhattan studio, saying he heard just minutes before his 8 am interview. “Somebody who was very close to him turned him in,” the president said, then revealing it was the suspect’s dad who relayed it through “a minister who was involved with law enforcement.That 'somebody who was very close to him' was his father.""Matt Robinson is a good father who did the right thing. Probably horrific to have to make that choice about your child but I'd like to think that teaching your children that actions have consequences is important.

Understanding solar eclipses – Types and what to expect

Total solar eclipse



The Moon completely covers the Sun.

Observers in a narrow zone experience brief daylight darkness.

Spectacular but rare. Partial solar eclipse



Only part of the Sun is covered by the Moon.

Creates a crescent or “bitten” appearance of the Sun.

This is the type occurring on September 21, 2025. Annular solar eclipse



The Moon is farther from Earth and doesn’t fully cover the Sun.

A ring of sunlight remains visible, forming the “ring of fire” effect.





In an extraordinary celestial turn, September 2025 is bookended by two eclipses, a lunar eclipse on the 7th and a solar eclipse just 15 days later. While the Moon recently turned a vivid red in a dramatic lunar display, the sky will offer another rare phenomenon: a partial solar eclipse on September 21, timed just before the equinox. However, this spectacle won’t be visible everywhere, and the UAE is among the regions that will miss it.On September 21, 2025, a partial solar eclipse will occur near the equinox, visible mainly across select regions in the Southern Hemisphere. Unlike a total eclipse, this will be a partial solar eclipse, where the Moon covers only part of the Sun, creating a crescent-shaped sliver of sunlight. Even as a partial eclipse, it provides a rare chance to observe the Sun’s changing face.This event holds additional significance because it closely precedes the September equinox, which falls on September 22, 2025. The equinox is one of two moments in the year when the Sun is directly above the Earth’s equator, resulting in nearly equal day and night lengths across the globe. Because of this timing, the eclipse is also being called an ""equinox eclipse"", adding to its astronomical and symbolic intrigue.The event also carries cultural and astrological meaning. This year's Pitru Paksha — a fortnight in the Hindu calendar dedicated to ancestral remembrance and rituals — uniquely begins with a lunar eclipse and ends with this solar eclipse, a rare alignment astrologers consider especially potent. This celestial pairing not only marks an important astronomical event but also deepens the spiritual significance of Pitru Paksha for many observers.Also Read: Saudi National Day 2025 The September 21 partial solar eclipse will be visible only in specific parts of the Southern Hemisphere, offering clear views to skywatchers in select regions.Skywatchers in visible regions must use proper solar filters or eclipse glasses to view the partial eclipse safely.Unlike the lunar eclipse on September 7, which had wide visibility across many countries, this solar eclipse will not be visible in the UAE or most parts of the Northern Hemisphere.Countries that will not witness any part of the eclipse include:This means millions of skywatchers across Asia and the Americas will miss the event entirely — a sharp contrast to the global excitement generated by the earlier lunar eclipse.A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon moves between the Earth and the Sun, partially or fully blocking sunlight in specific areas on Earth. These alignments don’t happen frequently in the same place due to the precise positioning required.There are three main types of solar eclipses:Although this particular eclipse is not a total one, its timing, rarity, and symbolic links to the equinox and Pitru Paksha make it a notable event in the 2025 celestial calendar.This will be the last solar eclipse of 2025, concluding a year that featured two solar eclipses","The final solar eclipse of 2025 on September 21 will be partially visible in southern Australia.

More Than 150,000 Evacuated in Pakistan Punjab After India’s Flood Alert

Relief in Jalalpur Pirwala, Alipur

Waters recede, but threat not over

Fields and cattle lost





Even as floodwaters began to recede in parts of south Punjab, the scale of destruction remains staggering, nearly 2.5 million people have been forced to flee their homes and at least 101 lives have been lost, the Dawn reported.The Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) has called the ongoing evacuation and relief drive one of the largest in recent memory. More than 1,500 boats were deployed to rescue stranded families, with 12,427 people evacuated from villages along the Chenab, Ravi and Sutlej rivers.Multan, Muzaffargarh and Rahim Yar Khan districts bore the brunt of the floods. Entire villages were submerged — including the union council of Lati Mari in Alipur tehsil, home to 40,000 people.“Nearly 15,000 people from our basti had to leave on their own as water rose,” said Syed Kausar Shah, a local resident. “Homes and crops were destroyed, and people escaped on a hired boat. Some now live in relief camps, others under the open sky.” He added that two villagers drowned while attempting to flee.Officials declared Jalalpur Pirwala and Alipur tehsils safe after a major flood wave passed through Head Panjnad.Multan Deputy Commissioner Waseem Hamid Sindhu confirmed that 100,000 people had been evacuated from Jalalpur Pirwala alone in three days.Breaches in Shujabad and Jalalpur Pirwala are now being filled, while helicopters and drones drop food and medicine into cut-off areas. Boats continue to ferry supplies into rural belts.At a press briefing in Bahawalpur, PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said Panjnad Headworks still faced a “high flood” but levels had dropped from 700,000 cusecs earlier this week to 575,000 cusecs on Saturday. By evening, the Flood Forecasting Division reported further decline to 492,695 cusecs.“There is no threat to Jalalpur Pirwala and Alipur cities,” Kathia assured, adding that water in Bahawalpur would also recede within 24 hours.

Protests Erupt in Pakistan, as Imran Khan Supporters Call for His Release

“

(With ANI inputs)





The sons of jailed former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said their father “will not be broken” by his “unlawful” imprisonment, as his legal team lodged an appeal with the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture.The elder son, Sulaiman Khan, condemned Khan's treatment in a statement attached to the appeal:Our father is being kept in conditions that no human being should endure. These are violations of his rights, and they amount to torture.”The younger son, Kasim Khan, said:The UN has already recognised that our father’s imprisonment is arbitrary and unlawful. What he is enduring now shows how far the regime will go to break him. But he will not be broken.”Sulaiman and Kasim are the cricketer-turned-politician’s sons with British filmmaker Jemima Goldsmith, with whom he was married for nine years until 2004. They live in the UK with Goldsmith.The appeal, filed by the US-based law firm Perseus Strategies on behalf of Khan’s legal team, alleged a “systematic pattern of abuse, including prolonged solitary confinement, denial of medical care, contaminated food, and restricted access to legal counsel and family visits.”His lawyers argued that these conditions breach Pakistan’s obligations under the UN Convention against Torture (CAT) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). They urged the UN to press authorities to safeguard the former PM’s physical and mental well-being.Khan has been in prison since August 2023 after being charged in multiple cases.","The sons of jailed former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said their father “will not be broken” by his “unlawful” imprisonment.

Poll Do you believe the reconstruction of LeT's Markaz Taiba is a threat to regional security? Yes, it poses a significant threat. No, it will not impact security.

How India destroyed LeT HQ



Why its reconstruction is a matter of concern?







Pakistan is financing the reconstruction of Lashkar-e-Taiba’s (LeT) Muridke headquarters, Markaz Taiba, which was destroyed in precision airstrikes during Operation Sindoor on May 7. According to ANI, citing an agency dossier, LeT has launched fundraising campaigns under the pretext of flood relief to support the redevelopment project.Moreover, Islamabad has already allocated PKR 4 crore, though the group estimates costs at over PKR 15 crore. The dossier stated that its army and ISI remain involved in sustaining and reviving LeT.Senior commanders Maulana Abu Zar and Yunus Shah Bukhari are overseeing the project, due by February 2026, mirroring past cases where LeT diverted humanitarian aid, including most of the 2005 earthquake relief, to militant infrastructure.This comes amidst Pakistan's continuous assertions on global platforms that it was combating terrorism.The Indian Air Force (IAF), earlier this year, showcased the extensive damage caused to LeT Muridke headquarters during Operation Sindoor, highlighting the precision and reach of the strikes.Muridke, home to LeT’s Markaz Taiba, was identified as a critical target. The strikes hit senior leadership residential areas and office buildings where commanders convened for planning and operations.The IAF showed videos captured directly from the weapons, pointing out the level of devastation within the complex.The airstrikes reportedly killed around a dozen high-value terrorists, including Yusuf Azhar, the IC-814 hijacker, Abu Jundal (also known as Mudassar), the Muridke chief of LeT, and the son of the planner of the 2016 Nagrota attack. The operation, conducted in retaliation for the Pahalgam killings, reinforced India’s ability to carry out precise, high-impact missions inside enemy territory.The ongoing reconstruction of LeT Markaz Taiba headquarters has raised serious concerns regarding regional security, given the facility’s central role in training and radicalizing terrorists. Established in 2000, the complex serves as both a residence for senior commanders and a training ground where recruits are instructed in intelligence gathering, arms handling, and other operational skills. Analysts warn that reviving the facility could strengthen LeT’s operational capabilities and enable the recruitment of new militants.Markaz Taiba functions as the “alma mater” of LeT, providing courses that combine physical and arms training with ideological indoctrination. The center attracts recruits from within Pakistan and abroad, using religious and radicalization programs to cultivate loyalty and operational skills among future militants. Its facilities, including a mosque and guest house financed by Osama bin Laden, underscore the longstanding support the organization has received from international terror networks.The scale of the operation at Markaz Taiba further amplifies the threat. The facility reportedly trains around 1,000 students annually, preparing them for operational roles within LeT. Past evidence has shown that graduates of this center have gone on to participate in high-profile attacks, including the 26/11 Mumbai attacks, highlighting the direct link between the facility and acts of cross-border terrorism targeting India.LeT’s historical connection with Pakistan’s intelligence apparatus adds another layer of concern. Senior commanders at the facility, including those who oversaw training for the 26/11 perpetrators, have operated under the guidance of the ISI.","Pakistan is financing the reconstruction of Lashkar-e-Taiba’s (LeT) Muridke headquarters, Markaz Taiba.

A 21-year-old girl was brutally gang-raped in Afghan Refugee Camp No. 16 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Haripur, The Express Tribune reported.Police on Saturday reported a brutal sexual assault. According to the First Information Report (FIR), the woman was on her way to the camp for work when the suspects dragged her into nearby fields, raped her for about two hours, and robbed her of Rs3,000 and a gold nose pin. She named the accused as Bacha, Nadi, Rozi Khan, Javed and Naseer, and said she was also beaten when she tried to resist.Khalabat police have registered a case against all five under Section 375A of the Pakistan Penal Code, which prescribes death or life imprisonment for gang rape. The incident has sparked outrage among local residents, and the victim’s family has demanded exemplary punishment for the accused.The UN refugee agency has reported that the expiry of the Proof of Registration (PoR) card grace period on August 31 has led to a sharp surge in Afghan returns from Pakistan, as per Dawn.According to a situation report released on Friday, voluntary returns in August rose by 254 per cent and deportations by 191 per cent compared with July, coinciding with the launch of the third phase of the ‘Illegal Foreigners Repatriation Plan’ (IFPR).As of September 4, a total of 531,700 Afghans had returned from Pakistan. Since April, more than 483,700 have gone back to Afghanistan, including 145,200 in August alone, with about 55,000 making the journey in just the last four days of the month.","A 21-year-old girl was brutally gang-raped in Afghan Refugee Camp No. 16 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Haripur.

A Pakistani Taliban ambush in northwest Pakistan on Saturday resulted in the deaths of at least 12 soldiers, as confirmed by local government and security officials to AFP.During a military convoy's passage through South Waziristan district at 4:00 am, ""armed men opened fire from both sides with heavy weapons"", resulting in 12 security personnel deaths and four injuries, according to a local government official.The area's security officer verified the casualties and reported that the assailants captured the convoy's weaponry.The Tehreek-e-Taliban (TTP), also known as the Pakistani Taliban, took responsibility for the attack via social media.This incident ranks among the most severe attacks in recent months within Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where the TTP previously controlled significant territories until a 2014 military operation forced their retreat.Since the Afghan Taliban's return to power in Kabul in 2021, militant activities have intensified in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border regions. Although distinct organisations, the TTP maintains close ties with the Afghan Taliban.Pakistan contends that Afghanistan fails to remove militants who use Afghan soil to attack Pakistan, whilst Kabul authorities reject these claims.Local residents across various Khyber Pakhtunkhwa districts have recently reported TTP-branded graffiti appearing on buildings, expressing concerns about a potential return to the group's previous control during the height of the US ""War on Terror"".A high-ranking local government official recently informed AFP about increased TTP fighter presence and attack frequency.Since January 1, approximately 460 individuals, predominantly security forces personnel, have lost their lives in attacks by anti-state armed groups in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan provinces, according to AFP's records.Pakistan experienced its most lethal period in nearly ten years during the previous year, with over 1,600 fatalities, including almost half being soldiers and police officers, as reported by the Islamabad-based Center for Research and Security Studies.","Pakistani Taliban ambush in northwest Pakistan kills at least 12 soldiers.

Poll Is it ethical for governments to use technology from foreign countries for surveillance? Yes, if it protects citizens No, it compromises sovereignty





Pakistan — with the help of Chinese technology — is spying on millions of its citizens to curb dissent and free speech, an Amnesty International report said.According to the report, Pakistan is using a Chinese-built internet firewall that censors social media, enabling spy agencies to monitor at least 4 million mobile phones at a time through its Lawful Intercept Management System (LIMS). The firewall, known as WMS 2.0, inspects internet traffic and can block 2 million active sessions at once.The human rights watchdog said it reviewed licensing agreements, trade data, leaked technical files, and Chinese records linking the firewall supplier to state-owned firms in Beijing.Amnesty said the firewall uses equipment from US-based Niagara Networks, software from Thales DIS — a unit of France's Thales — and servers from a Chinese state IT firm. An earlier version relied on Canada’s Sandvine.""The two monitoring systems function in tandem: one lets intelligence agencies tap calls and texts, while the other slows or blocks websites and social media across the country,"" the report said.""Mass surveillance creates a chilling effect in society, whereby people are deterred from exercising their rights, both online and offline,"" it added.The report further said that Pakistan is currently blocking about 650,000 web links and restricting access to platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, and X.It also accused agencies of spying on at least 4 million mobile phones at a time through LIMS, while WMS 2.0 can block 2 million active sessions at once, Amnesty said.Amnesty noted that its findings draw on a 2024 Islamabad High Court case filed by Bushra Bibi, the wife of former Prime Minister Imran Khan, after her private calls were leaked online.In court, Pakistan's defense ministries and intelligence agencies denied running or even having the capacity for phone tapping. However, under questioning, the telecom regulator admitted it had already ordered phone companies to install LIMS for use by ""designated agencies.""Crackdowns have tightened in recent years, particularly after the military broke with then Prime Minister Imran Khan in 2022. Khan was later jailed, and thousands of his party activists were detained.","Amnesty International: Pakistan using Chinese-built internet firewall that censors social media.

Both were later taken into custody and moved to the Adiala checkpoint.PTI condemned the act as “shameful,” alleging the women were planted for political motives and accusing police of helping them escape in a car. “The women were sent to Aleema's media talk as part of an agenda,” the party said.Leaders across the political spectrum criticized the attack.Balochistan National Party-Mengal chief Akhtar Mengal condemned the act, calling it “the lowest form of politics.”He said, “Even in enmity, a woman deserves dignity.

A relatively unknown militant group, Ittihad-ul-Mujahideen (IuM) Pakistan, has claimed responsibility for the suicide car bomb attack on the Federal Constabulary Corps in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Bannu division on Tuesday.The outfit claimed the attack, which involved a car rigged with IED, killed more than two dozen members of the Frontier Corps but Pakistan acknowledged only six fatalities. Predictably, it blamed India for the attack. Pakistan claimed to have neutralised five operatives in a 12-hour counter operation but the group asserted that its 'fidayeen' blew themselves up after carrying out the attack. One of the suicide bombers was identified by the group as Abdul Aziz alias Qassid Mohajir, a resident of Afghanistan's Paktika province.The Pakistan army camp suffered massive destruction in the suicide attack. Pakistan military's ISPR played down the incident, the latest in a series of attacks on Pakistani military personnel. ""During early hours of Sept 2, Indian proxy 'Fitna al Khwarij' targeted the Federal Constabulary Headquarters in Bannu district. The Indian-sponsored Kharjis attempted to breach the perimeter security, however, their nefarious designs were swiftly foiled by vigilant and resolute response.In their desperation, the Kahrjis rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into the perimeter wall. The suicide blast resulted in the partial collapse of the perimeter wall and damage to adjacent civilian infrastructure, inflicting injuries to three innocent civilians,"" ISPR said.IuM Pakistan, active since April, comprises fighters from outfits like Hafiz Gul Bahadur Group, Lashkar-e-Islam and Jamaat-Ul-Ahrar. In the last few months, it has claimed multiple attacks in areas like North Waziristan, Miranshah and Tirah Valley. Its strikes included sniper, rocket launcher and grenade attacks, and ambushes on convoys, besides drone strikes.

The provincial disaster management authority (PDMA) has warned that heavy rains could trigger urban flooding in Lahore, Gujranwala, and Gujrat.According to Dawn, the Chenab at Trimmu has already recorded a massive outflow of over 532,000 cusecs, classified as a “very high” flood, with projections of swelling to nearly 700,000 cusecs. The Ravi River is also in severe flood at Balloki Headworks with over 144,000 cusecs, while Sidhnai Headworks reported over 105,000 cusecs and rising.","Pakistani defence minister Khawaja Asif shared a bizarre flood mitigation measure for those affected asking them to consider ""storing"" the water in ""tubs"" His comments came as surging water levels in Pakistan rivers left 2.4 million people homeless in Punjab and 41 people dead.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123658833,imgsize-964457,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

KATHMANDU: On a stroll through Kathmandu’s Thamel district—the beating heart of Nepal’s tourist trade—the presence of China is hard to miss. Shop signs flash Mandarin translations, and even restaurant menus have dish details elaborated in the language. In narrow lanes once dominated almost entirely by Indian backpackers and European trekkers, Chinese tourists now form a noticeable second wave.At Tribhuvan International Airport, the shift has been made official. Alongside a long-standing immigration counter reserved for Indian citizens, a new one has been set up for Chinese travellers, with colourful words saying: 'Celebrating 70 years of Nepal-China friendship'. The gesture complements an existing visa-free regime for Chinese citizens, making their entry smoother than ever in the Himalayan nation.For Mausam Rana, a hotel manager in Thamel, the impact is visible in the guest ledger. “Indians still form the bulk of our clientele,” he said. “But Chinese numbers are rising. Till some time back, our hotel used to have around 15 or 20 Chinese tourists in a month—now it’s double that.With campaigns like 'Visit Nepal' this year and better flight connections, the peak season could bring even more.”Official data seems to confirm what the eye sees. In August, Nepal welcomed 88,680 foreign visitors, a 22 % rise from last year. Indians accounted for 40 %, Chinese 8.5 %, and Americans about 6 %. Himal Gautam, director at department of tourism, Nepal, told TOI, ""In August, a total of 7,533 Chinese tourists visited Nepal in comparison to 6,614 in the same month last year. SImilarly, in May, a total of 8,824 tourists from China visited our country against 8,381 in May last year.Indian tourists have always topped the chart in terms of foreign tourists visiting our country. But we are happy that more tourists are also coming from China and other countries as well.""The new relationship extends beyond tourism. Chinese automakers—BYD, Leap Motors, Omoda, XPENG, Dongfeng Forthing, Great Wall, to name a few, have flooded Kathmandu’s streets with sleek electric vehicles. Taxi driver Sushil Thapa, who has worked the roads for two decades, says Indian cars once ruled. “Now, whole fleets run on Chinese EVs. They’re stylish, affordable, and packed with features.”For Kathmandu-based analysts like Kanchan Jha, the trend is unmistakable. “It reflects a look-beyond-India mindset,” he said. “Our ties with India remain deep, but there is value in cultivating another giant across the mountains.”","In August, Nepal welcomed 88,680 foreign visitors, a 22 % rise from last year.

Poll Do you support the idea of using social media platforms for political activism? Yes, it's crucial for democracy. No, it can lead to chaos.





Nepal’s interim prime minister has announced her first cabinet appointments, in a move to stabilise the country after violent youth-led demonstrations forced the previous government out.At a ceremony held outdoors beside the torched presidential office, President Ram Chandra Paudel swore in three senior ministers on Monday in an event that was carried live on television.Among the new ministers, lawyer Om Prakash Aryal, recognised for his work on corruption, governance and human rights, will lead the home, law, justice and parliamentary affairs portfolio.Kulman Ghising, who is credited for ending years of crippling power cuts as head of the Nepal Electricity Authority, will oversee energy, infrastructure, transport and urban development, reported AFP.The former finance secretary Rameshwor Khanal, a renowned economist, takes charge of the finance ministry, confronting unemployment that affects one in five Nepalis aged 15 to 24.According to World Bank data, the country’s GDP per capita stands at only $1,447. Sushila Karki , 73-year-old former chief justice now serving as prime minister, faces the task of steering the country towards elections in March while addressing calls for clean governance.The crisis began on September 8, when a ban on social media set off mass demonstrations that tapped into years of economic frustration. Crowds torched parliament and other government buildings as anger spread, in scenes not seen since the end of the civil war and abolition of the monarchy in 2008.Government figures put the death toll at 72 over just two days, with another 191 still in hospital, as per an AFP report.Karki’s elevation followed behind-the-scenes talks led by army chief General Ashok Raj Sigdel and President Paudel, who also engaged with “Gen Z” activists. Thousands of young protesters had used Discord to push her candidacy.She admitted on Sunday that she had “not wished” to take the post, but that her “name was brought from the streets”.Karki pledged her administration would work “according to the thinking of the Gen Z generation”, saying young people wanted “the end of corruption, good governance and economic equality”.","Sushila Karki, 73, sworn in as Nepal's interim prime minister on Monday.

KATHMANDU: As Nepal struggles to recover from the Sept 8–9 protests that left at least 72 people dead and the country grappling with a trail of destruction, police personnel involved in controlling the surging crowds that took to the streets, say they were caught in a Catch-22 situation.“Nobody bothered to know what we went through. We became villains in the eyes of the public just because we followed govt orders. If we hadn’t obeyed, we would have faced consequences. If we did, we had to risk our lives controlling the volatile crowds. Either way, we were doomed. Sadly, nobody saw our situation,” said a police officer deployed at Durbar Marg, which was slowly returning to normalcy on Sunday.Among the dead were three Nepal police officers too. An assistant head constable stationed near the charred remains of Singha Durbar, said the silence over the deaths of the police personnel was ""deeply painful"". “Everyone talks about the protesters. But we, too, are humans with families. Our colleagues, who were sole breadwinners for their families, were brutally thrashed and killed on the streets. The trauma their family members are enduring is unimaginable. ”Cops say the least the new govt can do is give jobs to dependents of those killed. “The most eligible family member should be allowed to replace them in the force,” a senior sub-inspector said. “And those responsible for killing the three personnel must be brought to justice, just as there is demand for action against those who killed protesters.

Experts Hail ‘Nepal’s Step Towards Democracy’, Praise Sushila Karki’s Six-Month Deadline For Power





As Nepal picks up its pieces following the violent protests that left many of the country's iconic buildings as well as hundreds of govt offices and homes badly damaged, an unusual economy is stirring amidst the rubble. Scrap dealers in Kathmandu are bracing for a windfall, as heaps of building material, metal and junk is cleared from vandalised govt complexes, burnt-down car showrooms, and ransacked supermarkets.""The junk largely comprises charred cars, damaged furniture and other metal scrap from torched public buildings,"" an official of the Kathmandu Metropolitan City administration said. ""It will eventually be auctioned to scrap dealers through tenders once cleanup is complete,"" he added.Among the areas that were ravaged in the Sept 8-9 'Gen Z' protests that led to downfall of the KP Sharma Oli government were the historic Singha Durbar, the Supreme Court, office of the attorney general, and the parliament building in Kathmandu. Besides, scores of govt offices in around 250 municipalities were damaged due to vandalism and arson, a spokesperson at the ministry of federal affairs and general administration was quoted as saying by The Kathmandu Post.Biratnagar’s four-storey municipal building was reduced to rubble, while two ward offices were burned. Birgunj saw three of its seven buildings rendered unusable, and 95 per cent of municipal properties destroyed, the newspaper reported.“What happened to the properties was very unfortunate. They should not have been damaged. But then somebody has to now take care of disposal of the mess. Scrap dealers will do that,” said Paban Tamling, a local scrap merchant. He added that business could triple or even quadruple.“Before the protest, the annual business of scrap dealing in Kathmandu was around 2 crore Nepalese rupees. But now, after the vandalism and arson, it would easily cross over 5 crore,” Tamling added.Deepak Jaiswal, who runs the recycling firm 'Thalo Kawadi', echoed the sentiment. “We are waiting for officials to finish assessing the damage and then float tenders. The number of bidders this time will surely increase, as many will try to jump into the business. It sounds odd after such tragic events, but it’s the harsh truth—someone’s loss is another’s business.”","Scrap dealers in Kathmandu are bracing for a windfall as heaps of building material, metal and junk is cleared from vandalised govt complexes, burnt-down car showrooms, and ransacked supermarkets.

Nepal police have re-arrested over 3,700 inmates who escaped during last week’s violent anti-government protests, officials said on Sunday.Deputy Inspector General Binod Ghimire, spokesperson for Nepal Police, reported that 3,723 prisoners have been returned to jail, while 10,320 remain at large, urging the public to remain alert.More than 13,500 inmates escaped from prisons across Nepal within 24 hours of the Gen Z protest movement, triggering the country’s worst internal security crisis in decades. The mass jailbreak has also raised concerns in India, where some fugitives are wanted or linked to criminal networks along the Bihar and Uttar Pradesh border.While a handful of escapees have reportedly promised to return once unrest subsides, most remain untraceable. The crisis has been further complicated by the burning of court records in arson attacks, hampering follow-up action by authorities.A joint campaign by the Nepali Army, Nepal Police, and Armed Police Force is underway to track down and arrest the escaped prisoners, DIG Binod Ghimire said, as cited by PTI.Among the escapees are some of Nepal’s most notorious convicts and politically sensitive detainees. They include former junior minister Sanjay ‘Takla’ Sah, convicted for the 2012 Janakpur bomb blast and the 2007 murder of industrialist Arun Kumar Singhania.Others are kidnapper Uday Shetti, known for cross-border operations in the Raxaul-Sitamarhi corridor, suspended deputy prime minister Top Bahadur Rayamajhi, on trial in the fake Bhutanese refugee scam, and former home secretary Tek Narayan Pandey. Singhania’s killing drew outrage in Bihar and Jharkhand, where his family remains active in business and media.","More than 13,500 inmates escaped from prisons across Nepal within 24 hours of the Gen Z protest movement.

Sushila Karki Sworn In as Nepal’s Interim Prime Minister

Poll Do you believe Sushila Karki's government will effectively restore stability in Nepal? Yes, definitely No, not at all





As she took charge of Nepal's interim prime minister on Sunday, Sushila Karki’s first act was to define the limits of her own power. Taking charge at Singha Durbar on Sunday, the former Chief Justice made clear that her government is only a bridge to elections.In the same breath, she located the moral core of her authority in the Gen Z protests of September 8, declaring those killed as ""martyrs"" and promising their families state compensation. By doing so, Karki framed her government not as a continuation of discredited politics, but as an answer to the demand for justice that brought her to power.Sushila Karki, former Chief Justice of Nepal, became the country’s first woman to hold the post of prime minister when she assumed office at Singha Durbar on Sunday, days after violent protests across the country.After taking charge, Karki addressed the media and said her government’s role is limited to ensuring stability, justice, and preparing for elections within six months.She inherits an office vacated by KP Sharma Oli after days of violent protests left 72 people dead. These protests, led largely by young Nepalis, were sparked by the government’s social media ban but quickly turned into a movement demanding accountability, economic reform, and an end to corruption.""I and my team are not here to taste the power. We won't stay for more than six months. We will hand over the responsibility to the new parliament. We won't succeed without your support,"" she said at a press conference.She recognised the September 8 youth-led protest and announced that those who died will be honoured as martyrs. She also declared that their families would receive compensation of NRs one million each.""27 hours of movement is first in Nepal. They are demanding economic equality and the eradication of corruption. All the deceased of September 8 are announced martyrs and will be given one million each. Expenses of the injured will be borne by the government, and they will also be compensated,"" she said.According to The Himalayan Times, 72 people have died in the protests so far — 59 demonstrators, 10 prison inmates, and three police officers.Karki said the government would help in sending the bodies of the deceased to their home districts. She also said that those who suffered damage to personal property will be supported by the state. Reconstruction and economic recovery will be a priority. ""We are in an economic crisis. We should discuss and work on the reconstruction,"" she added.Karki, who earlier served as Nepal’s first female Chief Justice, has taken over with the backing of the Gen Z-led protest movement.The September 8 demonstrations, led mainly by young activists, were triggered by anger over corruption, lack of accountability, and the government’s decision to ban social media.The 73-year-old was sworn in as interim Prime Minister on Friday. Protesters had endorsed her name, citing her independence and integrity, after Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli resigned following the unrest.","Sushila Karki, former Chief Justice of Nepal, became the country’s first woman to hold the post of prime minister when she assumed office on Sunday.

NAIROBI: A Nairobi court issued an arrest warrant Tuesday for a British citizen in connection with the high-profile death of a young Kenyan mother whose body was found in a septic tank over a decade ago.Agnes Wanjiru, 21, died in 2012 after she reportedly went partying with British soldiers at a hotel in central Nanyuki town, where Britain has a permanent army garrison.The Office for the Director of Public Prosecutions (ODPP) said it had informed the court ""that evidence gathered links the suspect, a United Kingdom citizen, to the murder"".Nairobi High Court judge Alexander Muteti said there was ""probable cause to order the arrest of the accused and his surrender before this court for his trial"", granting a warrant for ""one citizen and resident of the United Kingdom"".Following the judge's ruling, the ODPP said in a statement on X that ""extradition proceedings would now be initiated to ensure the suspect is brought before a Kenyan court"".Wanjiru's sister, Rose Wanyua Wanjiku, 52, welcomed the announcement and told AFP: ""Let justice prevail"".""As a family we are very happy because it has been many years but now we can see a step has been made,"" she said.- 'Accelerate progress' -A spokesperson for the British government acknowledged the DPP had ""determined that a British National should face trial in relation to the murder of Ms Wanjiru in 2012"".The government remains ""absolutely committed to helping them secure justice"", but will not comment further due to legal proceedings, according to a statement.In October 2021, The Sunday Times reported that a soldier had confessed to his comrades to killing Wanjiru and showed them her body.The report alleged that the murder was taken to military superiors, but there was no further action.A Kenyan investigation was opened in 2019 but no results have been disclosed. The ODPP said earlier that a team of senior prosecutors had been assembled to review the case.British defence minister John Healey met the family earlier this year, stressing the need to ""accelerate progress"" on the case.Since Kenya gained independence in 1963, Britain has kept a permanent army base near Nanyuki around 200 kilometres (125 miles) north of the capital Nairobi.The British Army Training Unit in Kenya is an economic lifeline for many in Nanyuki but has faced criticism over incidents of misconduct by its soldiers.","A Kenyan court issues an arrest warrant for a British citizen in connection with the high-profile death of a young Kenyan mother.

FULL SPEECH: Elon Musk’s EXPLOSIVE Message To Americans After Kirk’s Murder | ‘Fight Back Or Die’

Poll Should public figures avoid using inflammatory language during protests? Yes, it prevents violence No, free speech comes first





UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s office on Monday criticised US tech billionaire Elon Musk for using what it described as ""dangerous and inflammatory language"" during a televised speech at one of the UK’s largest far-right protests.About 150,000 people joined the London protest on Saturday, organised by activist Tommy Robinson under the banner ""Unite the Kingdom.""In his address, Musk called for Britain’s parliament to be dissolved and for Starmer’s Labour government to be replaced. He also told the crowd that ""violence is coming"" and that ""you either fight back or you die.""Starmer’s spokesperson said: ""The UK is a fair, tolerant and decent country, and so the last thing the British people want is dangerous and inflammatory language, which threatens violence and intimidation on our streets.""Protesters marched over Westminster Bridge and gathered near Downing Street, where speakers included far-right figures from Europe and North America.UK home secretary Shabana Mahmood also condemned the protest, which saw violent clashes, and referred to Musk as a ""hostile billionaire"" for urging people to fight against Britain’s democracy.Speaking in the House of Commons, Mahmood said 26 police officers were injured and 24 protesters arrested during the demonstration.She added that while many protesters exercised their right to protest, ""some turned on the brave police officers who were there to keep the peace.""She continued: ""Those violent thugs will face the full force of the law, but those who turn to violence on Saturday do not represent who this country really is. When a foreign billionaire calls on our citizens to fight against our ancient democracy, I know this is met by the vast majority with a shake of the head. That is because we are, in truth, a tolerant country. And yes, we are a diverse one too. You can be English with roots here that stretch back 1,000 years. But you can also be English and look like me.""Mahmood repeated Starmer’s earlier message that the St George’s Cross and Union Jack flags are ""symbols of unity"" and should not be used to divide people.""The words that were used at the weekend are abhorrent and I know that the vast majority of people in this country will feel the same way; whether you're a hostile state or a hostile foreign billionaire, no one gets to mess with British democracy,” she added.Starmer had said on Sunday: ""Britain is a nation proudly built on tolerance, diversity and respect. Our flag represents our diverse country and we will never surrender it to those that use it as a symbol of violence, fear and division.""At the protest, Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, claimed that UK courts had put the rights of undocumented migrants above those of the ""local community."" He cited a Court of Appeal ruling that overturned an injunction stopping asylum seekers from being housed at the Bell Hotel in Essex.""They told the world that Somalians, Afghans, Pakistanis, all of them, their rights supersede yours — the British public, the people that built this nation,"" he told the crowd.Robinson’s supporters later threw objects at anti-racism counter-protesters as both groups faced off on Whitehall in central London.","UK PM's office criticises Elon Musk for using ""dangerous and inflammatory language"" Musk called for Britain's parliament to be dissolved and for Starmer's Labour government to be replaced.

LONDON: UK PM Keir Starmer on Monday condemned ""dangerous"" comments by Elon Musk after the X and Tesla owner told an anti-immigration rally that violence is coming to Britain and they must fight or die. But the UK govt resisted opposition calls to sanction Musk for the remarks. Starmer denounced violence on the fringes of Saturday's 1,00,000 or more-strong ""Unite the Kingdom"" demonstration in London organized by far-right campaigner Tommy Robinson.Addressing the demonstration, Musk called for the dissolution of Parliament and an early election to remove Starmer's center-left govt. Starmer's spokesman, Dave Pares, said he didn't think ""the British public will have any truck with that kind of language. ""The UK is a fair, tolerant and decent country, so the last thing that British people want is dangerous and inflammatory language which threatens violence and intimidation on our streets,"" he said. Ed Davey, leader of the Liberal Democrats, the third-largest party in UK Parliament, urged Starmer, Conservative opposition leader Kemi Badenoch and Reform UK leader Nigel Farage to join him in condemning Musk's attempt ""to sow discord and incite violence "" and interfere with UK democracy. Davey urged Starmer to block Tesla from getting govt contracts.Starmer's spokesman said the govt had no plans to sanction Musk over his comments. Starmer wrote on X that peaceful protest ""is core to our country's values.

Man arrested over 'racially motivated rape' of British PIO woman in Oldbury,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/man-arrested-over-racially-motivated-rape-of-british-pio-woman-in-oldbury/articleshow/123906639.cms,"



LONDON: A man has been arrested on suspicion of rape after a British Sikh woman was physically attacked and raped in Oldbury last week. Police are describing the rape as “racially motivated”.West Midlands police arrested a man, aged in his 30s, on Sunday night. He remains in custody.The woman, in her 20s, told police she was raped and beaten between 8am and 8.30am on Sept 9 in Thame Road and that the two male white perpetrators shouted at her: “You don’t belong in this country, get out.”The Sikh woman, in a statement issued through Sikh Youth UK, said: “All I was doing was going about my day on my way to work, and what has happened has deeply affected us. Through it all my family has been my rock, and my community has stood strong beside me.”Sandwell police chief superintendent Kim Madill said: “This is a significant development in the investigation which remains on-going.”The rape has triggered huge concern and fear among the Sikh community, who feel anti-Sikh hate crimes are not being treated with utmost seriousness by the British govt.The UK Gurdwara Alliance sent a letter to home secretary Shabana Mahmood which states: “Silence from you and the home office following the racist sexual attack last Tuesday is unacceptable.We need you to show public solidarity with the victim and the Sikh community. Most Sikhs are visibly identifiable by our articles of faith and appearance and have been vulnerable worldwide since 9/11.”Responding to a question in the House of Commons on Monday, Mahmood said: “The horror of a sexual assault motivated by race or ethnicity is absolutely appalling. I’m sure the whole House will join me in condemning such crimes in the strongest possible terms. This govt will not stand for any incitement to racial hatred or violence and it is imperative, and I think incumbent, on all members of the House to make sure we all jointly, collectively hold that line. ”Dabinderjit Singh, lead executive for political engagement at Sikh Federation (UK), said: “We hope the other man will also be arrested, charged and prosecutions will quickly follow for this vile crime.”","A man has been arrested on suspicion of rape after a British Sikh woman was physically attacked and raped in Oldbury last week.

'Stop Radical Islam': Anti-Immigrant Vs Anti-Racism Protesters Clash In Liverpool; UK Cops In Action

The Reddit post on moving back to India from the UK went viral.





A post by an Indian Redditor who claimed that there is enough racism in the UK against Indians that they started to feel unwelcome and moved back to India went viral as people found the experience relatable. The post came as a huge anti-immigrant protest, organized by far-right activist Tommy Robinson, took place in London.The Redditor claimed they turned down as extension of the visa because it was difficult to adjust with the UK lifestyle. ""Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of positives - great public transport, amazing grocery options, personal freedom, great work-life balance, clean air, and so much space to walk. There’s a lot of things I liked too. But overall, the lack of vibrancy, combined with living alone and struggling to make friends, wore me down. The salary hit will hurt, but mentally I couldn’t cope in the UK anymore. Some people thrive there, but I just couldn't,"" the person wrote.""Most Brits I met were polite and tolerant, but I did experience subtle (and sometimes not subtle) racism. Enough that I started to feel unwelcome, like I didn’t belong,"" the viral post read.""India has a whole lot of problems. I guess it comes down to the problems you find you can tolerate in the end!"" the writer added, replying to a post.The post went viral as several NRIs expressed their feelings about the UK and how it's not a great option because of the cost and also racism. ""I agree with all your points.

Britain, the Petulant Empire



Ricky Gervais - Armageddon - ''I love Illegal Immigrants'' Joke

A Tired Democracy in Labour’s Hands



Hello, Mr Robinson...

Musk’s Words



“You either fight back or you die.”

“Whether you choose violence or not, violence is coming to you.”

“There’s got to be a dissolution of Parliament and a new vote held.”

“My appeal is to British common sense… if this continues, that violence is going to come to you.”

“There’s a massive incentive on the left to import voters. If they can’t convince their nation to vote for them, they’re going to import people from other nations to vote for them. It’s a strategy that will succeed if it is not stopped.”

“The left is the party of murder and celebrating murder. That’s who we’re dealing with here.”

These weren’t tweets carefully crafted for plausible deniability. They were frontal assaults, wrapped in conspiracies about Labour’s immigration policies. The claim that Starmer’s government is “importing voters” was pure nativist paranoia, but it resonated with a crowd already convinced Britain is being “replaced.”

Musk’s Grooming Gang Crusade



The Scandal



Can Musk Do a Trump in Britain?



Reason One: Britain Has No Trump



Reason Two: The System Is Built to Block Insurgents



Reason Three: Keep Calm and Trust the System







There’s a certain irony that anti-immigration rhetoric is the strongest political currency in Britain right now. The same Britain that once sent its ships across the seven seas, peddling opium in Canton, sugar in the Caribbean, and civilisation as a side hustle everywhere else. The same Britain that built its fortunes by traversing the globe and telling everyone else to play by its rules. And now, when denizens of those very lands show up at Heathrow with legal visas or rubber dinghies, the keepers of empire clutch their pearls. Suddenly, movement across borders is an existential threat. Apparently it was fine when the British moved, but not when the world moves back in their direction.This is the backdrop Elon Musk has parachuted into, with the grace of a meme lord and the menace of a billionaire arsonist. He has found Britain’s sorest nerve—immigration—and jabbed it with the same glee he once reserved for short-sellers. Grooming gangs, free speech, Tommy Robinson: Musk has taken Britain’s ugliest domestic quarrels and broadcast them to the world, not because he loves Britain, but because chaos is his native language.Which brings us to the real question: can Musk pull a Trump in Great Britain? Can the man who helped bend American democracy around a reality-TV demagogue do the same to a parliamentary system that prides itself on being too boring to collapse?The first obstacle to answering that question is Britain itself.This is a country that never got over the loss of its empire. The sun may have set on the colonies, but the nostalgia shines brighter than the July drizzle. Britain still teaches itself a Disneyfied history of Magna Carta, Churchill, and “We Stood Alone,” while airbrushing out the famine in Bengal or the fact that “Rule Britannia” was basically the anthem of global piracy.That unresolved imperial hangover feeds directly into today’s immigration hysteria. Britain acts shocked—shocked!—that people from South Asia, Africa, and the Middle East want to live in the country that once ruled them, looted their resources, and redrew their borders. Immigration isn’t an accident of globalisation. It is the boomerang of empire. Britain threw its weight around the world for centuries, and now the world is throwing itself back.Yet the political class behaves as if migration is an alien invasion. The Tories reduced it to a three-word slogan—“Stop the Boats.” Labour promises competence while quietly nudging right. Even when net migration is fuelling universities, health care, and the economy, the debate remains stuck in Daily Mail hysteria. Britain is the empire that colonised the world and now wants a refund.The July 2024 general election delivered Keir Starmer’s Labour a crushing majority, ending fourteen years of Conservative decline. By all logic, Labour should now enjoy stability: a solid parliamentary bloc, five years to govern, the Tories reduced to rubble. Instead, within a year, Starmer’s government already looks exhausted. Approval ratings have tanked, and the party that promised change has settled into the bureaucratic boredom of managing decline.The problems aren’t minor. Immigration is once again the public’s number one concern. The NHS is stretched past breaking. Public services creak under austerity’s hangover. And despite a commanding Commons majority, Labour already looks like it’s governing on probation.This is what makes Musk’s interventions sting. He isn’t yelling at a Conservative government limping toward defeat. He’s taunting a Labour government barely out of its honeymoon, daring it to explain why things already feel worse. Britain wanted an alternative. Labour won on that promise. But in the absence of tangible change, Musk’s circus suddenly feels more relevant than Starmer’s carefully ironed suits.On a September weekend in London, Tommy Robinson’s “Unite the Kingdom” march drew an estimated 110,000–150,000 people—by far one of the largest demonstrations Britain has seen in decades. Organisers billed it as a “free speech” event, but the message was anti-immigration to its core. Placards warned of civil war, chants called out the Labour government, and the police reported twenty-six officers injured after clashes, with four seriously hurt. Twenty-five people were arrested.Counter-protests by Stand Up to Racism brought about 5,000 people to nearby streets. The state deployed roughly 1,000 officers to keep the sides apart. Bottles flew, fists landed, and Britain’s fractured immigration debate spilled onto its pavements.And then, beamed in via screen, came Elon Musk.Musk’s intervention was not subtle. His speech hit hard, framed less as commentary and more as a call to arms:This was not Musk’s first British foray. Earlier in 2025 he went on a posting spree about grooming gangs, accusing Labour of complicity, calling for officials to be hanged, and demanding Tommy Robinson’s release. It was sensationalism masquerading as concern, and it put Labour on the defensive over cases that long predate Starmer’s premiership.The irony is glaring: Musk isn’t solving Britain’s problems; he’s exploiting them. His attacks make Labour look like the party that ignores children, immigration, and crime, at precisely the moment when Starmer most needs credibility.Every political earthquake in Britain shakes around immigration, but nowhere has the betrayal felt sharper than in the grooming gang scandals. For years, local councils and police forces looked the other way as gangs — disproportionately made up of men of Pakistani origin — preyed on vulnerable white working-class girls in towns like Rotherham, Rochdale, and Telford. Reports show officials feared being branded racist, so they let crimes fester. Britain, in its obsession with maintaining the illusion of multicultural harmony, sacrificed its own daughters.That failure is more than just a tragedy. It is an open wound in the national psyche, one that populists can reopen at will. When Elon Musk tweets about grooming gangs, he isn’t importing an American culture war — he’s plunging his finger into Britain’s self-inflicted scar tissue.And here’s the irony: after decades of cowardice, the state now swings its authority in the opposite direction. Instead of facing its failures honestly, it arrests ordinary citizens for posting memes. What it once ignored in fear of offending a community, it now over-polices to signal virtue. The result is a political climate where genuine crimes were overlooked, but digital jokes are prosecuted. It is this inversion of justice — tolerance for predators, intolerance for speech — that makes Musk’s interventions resonate with a public that feels doubly betrayed.So, can Musk pull a Trump here? Structurally, no. Legally, no. Culturally, unlikely. Donald Trump was a perfect storm: a reality-TV celebrity with name recognition, a tabloid appetite for scandal, and the instinct to speak to grievances no one else would touch. He didn’t just use social media; he embodied the fantasy of smashing politics with a sledgehammer. Britain, for all its flirtations with Boris Johnson, has no such figure right now. Johnson tried to cosplay Trump, but collapsed under the weight of wine bottles and WhatsApps. Nigel Farage talks the talk but has never had the charisma or machinery to seize Downing Street. Tommy Robinson can fill the streets, but not the ballot box. Until Britain produces a true populist figure who can straddle celebrity, grievance, and electoral appeal, Musk has no avatar to ride to power.Trump won because the US Electoral College makes it possible to lose the popular vote and still become president. America’s system rewards geographic quirks: scrape narrow wins in the right swing states and you can govern a country that mostly didn’t vote for you. Britain doesn’t work like that. First-past-the-post is brutal, but it’s also stabilising: it punishes insurgent parties whose votes are spread thin. Reform UK can poll 20–30% nationally and still end up with a handful of seats. There are no Super PACs to supercharge campaigns, no billionaire chequebooks, and no presidential race for Musk to hijack with memes. Unless Britain’s system itself cracks, Musk’s meddling hits a ceiling.Another reason why Musk has an uphill task is because Britain’s political system — a peculiar mix of monarchy and parliamentary democracy — has survived crises that would have broken most other states. Where the continent went through upheavals, toppled kings, and communist revolutions, Britain largely sidestepped the red madness. The monarchy has always acted as a weathervane: not the source of power, but a shrewd symbol of it, capable of bending whichever way the wind was blowing. It has survived Cromwell, communism, and will survive Musk.Even Oliver Cromwell, the man who chopped off a king’s head and declared himself Lord Protector, could only stretch the experiment one generation. Within a few years of his death, the monarchy was back, restored like an old habit Britain couldn’t quit. No matter how radical the politics, the crown remained the centrepiece of continuity.And when Marx himself lived in London — scribbling in the British Library, penning Das Kapital, and watching revolutions rage across the continent — he could do little more than write. His ideas may have shaken Paris, Moscow, and Beijing, but Britain absorbed him as just another eccentric émigré. Here, the communists weren’t storming Buckingham Palace; they were politely running for council seats in Islington.The monarchy, ever the chameleon, survived by becoming a national mood ring: pomp when Britain felt imperial, pageantry when Britain felt nostalgic, and soft-power branding when Britain felt irrelevant.For Musk, this is an immovable obstacle. The system isn’t fragile in the way America’s was in 2016. It has centuries of practice in deflecting chaos, muting revolt, and dressing decline in ceremonial robes. A republic can produce a Trump; a monarchy produces commemorative tea sets.In other words, Britain has survived Cromwell, communism, and countless prophets of upheaval not by fighting change head-on but by absorbing it, softening it, and turning it into ceremony. Musk may fancy himself a disruptor, but disruption is precisely what Britain’s political immune system is built to withstand. The system has outlasted kings, protectors, and ideologues; it will almost certainly outlast a billionaire with Wi-Fi.Britain tamed Marx. Musk shouldn't be a problem.",Elon Musk sent a series of tweets after the murder of Labour MP Chris Kirk. He called for a dissolution of Parliament and a new vote to be held.

‘Prosecute Israeli Leaders’: Hamas Sends Urgent Warning To Arab World; Big Action Looms?





Israelis will be barred from enrolling at a prestigious government-run defence studies institute in London over the war in Gaza, UK media reported Monday.The Royal College of Defence Studies, which is overseen by the defence ministry, will bar Israeli students from next year, according to The Times and Telegraph newspapers.The post-graduate college part of the Defence Academy of the United Kingdom offers training for ""strategic thinkers and leaders within the armed forces and civil service"", according to its website, with international students allowed to study specific courses.A UK ministry of defence official in June confirmed to parliament that the college was providing ""non-combat academic courses"" to ""fewer than five"" members of the Israeli military.The ministry did not immediately reply to an AFP request for comment.But Amir Baram, the director general of Israel's defence ministry who studied at the college, slammed the decision as a ""discriminatory act"" and ""disloyalty to an ally at war"".""Frankly, Israel's exclusion is nothing less than an act of self-sabotage of British security,"" Baram, also a senior Israeli army military official, reportedly wrote in a letter to the UK defence ministry.Britain has suspended some arms export licences to Israel for weapons used in Gaza, but some UK-made parts, such as components for Israeli F-35 warplanes, were exempt.Last week, Israeli officials were banned from attending a major arms fair in London as Prime Minister Keir Starmer tries to put some distance between his government and Israel's war against Hamas.However, 51 Israeli weapons companies still attended the show, including major arms manufacturer Elbit, prompting a pro-Palestinian protest outside the exhibition.London has slammed Israel's latest push to escalate its nearly two-year-long military offensive in Gaza as ""wrong"".","Israelis will be barred from enrolling at a prestigious government-run defence studies institute in London.

Harry & Charles Reunite In Secret; William Restless, Kate’s Solo Move Adds To Speculation





Britain’s Prince Harry has defended his autobiography, saying he had no regrets about publishing it more than two years ago, even though it caused tensions within the British royal family.""I don't believe that I aired my dirty laundry in public,"" British King Charles III's younger son told the Guardian in an interview.""It was a difficult message, but I did it in the best way possible. My conscience is clear,"" he said.The book, released in January 2023, gave a detailed account of his life as a prince and of the royal family. It sold in large numbers but drew criticism from Buckingham Palace for his remarks about family members, including his brother's wife Catherine and his stepmother Camilla.The book further strained Harry’s ties with the royal family. He had stepped down from royal duties in 2020 and moved to California with his wife, Meghan.Before meeting Charles on Wednesday in an unannounced visit, Harry had not seen his father for 19 months. Their last meeting was in February 2024, when Harry travelled to the UK after Charles revealed his cancer diagnosis. The king is still under treatment.Harry, who continues to hold the title Duke of Sussex, said Spare was ""not about revenge"".""The book? It was a series of corrections to stories already out there. One point of view had been put out and it needed to be corrected.""Harry had earlier said he hopes for ""reconciliation"" with his father, as he ""did not know how much longer my father has"".""It is about accountability,"" he told the Guardian in Kyiv, which he visited on Friday for charitable reasons.""I know that (speaking out) annoys some people and it goes against the narrative,"" he said.This was the second time Harry had visited Ukraine since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022. He made a trip to the western city of Lviv in April.""We cannot stop the war but what we can do is do everything we can to help the recovery process,"" Harry told the Guardian newspaper while on an overnight train to Kyiv.Harry, a British Army veteran who served in Afghanistan, is the founder of the Invictus Games, a Paralympic-style event designed to inspire military veterans around the world as they work to overcome battlefield injuries.

The US vice president JD Vance announced that he will host 'The Charlie Kirk Show' from the White House on Monday to pay tribute to his slain friend.The show is scheduled to air at noon, less than a week after Kirk was assassinated during a college campus visit in Utah.Vance and Kirk had been close friends for many years, long before Vance entered politics. In a letter to Kirk shared after his death at Utah Valley University, Vance reflected on their time together.He noted that Kirk was one of the first people he contacted when he decided to run for the US Senate in 2021 and that Kirk helped connect him with others who could support his campaign, including Donald Trump Jr.Vance described Kirk as one of his most dedicated advocates over the years, who even helped guide the selection process that ultimately led to Vance becoming vice-president.The vice president said he first learned about Kirk being shot through group messages with friends and government officials while in a meeting in the West Wing.“God didn’t answer those prayers, and that’s OK. He had other plans. And now that Charlie is in heaven, I’ll ask him to talk to big man directly on behalf of his family, his friends, and the country he loved so dearly,” Vance wrote.Vance had also accompanied Kirk’s body during transport from Utah to his home state of Arizona.Images from the flight show Kirk’s wife, Erika, dressed in black and holding their two young children, walking hand-in-hand with second lady Usha Vance. The vice president and uniformed service members helped carry the flag-draped casket onto the plane.Earlier, on Wednesday, Vance paid tribute to Kirk on social media, calling him “a true friend” and a major influence in his rise in national politics. Kirk, the conservative activist who was shot at Utah Valley University, helped shape Vance’s path from a MAGA outsider to the vice presidency.“Charlie was fascinated by ideas and always willing to learn and change his mind,” Vance wrote. “Like me, he was skeptical of Donald Trump in 2016. Like me, he came to see President Trump as the only figure capable of moving American politics away from the globalism that had dominated for our entire lives. When others were right, he learned from them. When he was right — as he usually was — he was generous.”Vance said Kirk was crucial to his 2022 Senate campaign in Ohio, assisting with strategy, fundraising, and grassroots connections. “He introduced me to some of the people who would run my campaign and also to Donald Trump Jr, who took a call from me because Charlie asked,” he wrote.Kirk's children also remained deeply involved with Vance’s family and they often spent time together. ""Our kids, especially our oldest, struggled with the attention and the constant presence of the protective detail. I felt this acute sense of guilt that I had conscripted my kids into this life without getting their permission,"" Vance said.""And Charlie was constantly calling and texting, checking on our family and offering guidance and prayers,"" he added.","US vice president JD Vance will host 'The Charlie Kirk Show' from the White House on Monday.

‘Fight back or die’: Musk tells London far-right rally to topple govt,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/fight-back-or-die-musk-tells-london-far-right-rally-to-topple-govt/articleshow/123886248.cms,"London: Thousands Of Anti-Immigration Protesters Clash With Police | Watch





LONDON: US tech billionaire Elon Musk appeared via video link at a far-right rally in London Saturday, telling Britons to “fight back or you die” and urging them to overthrow their govt and dissolve Parliament.The “Unite the Kingdom” march, organised by far-right activist Tommy Robinson, drew around 150,000 people. Violence broke out when a section of Robinson supporters allegedly tried to storm police cordons keeping them apart from a 5,000-strong counter-protest by Stand Up to Racism.Twenty-six police officers were wounded — four seriously, with broken teeth, a suspected broken nose, concussion, a prolapsed disc and a head wounds. Police said 24 arrests were made, with more expected.Musk told the crowd “the Left are the party of murder” and railed against what he called the “woke mind virus”. He alleged Britain faced “destruction” from uncontrolled migration and failures to stop grooming gangs. “Whether you choose violence or not, it is coming to you, you either fight back or you die,” he said. “The BBC is complicit in the destruction of Britain.”Musk called for a change of govt and fresh elections, warning of “genuine risk of rape and murder and destruction of the country and dissolution of entire way of life”.Reactions were swift. PM Keir Starmer condemned the violence: “People have a right to peaceful protest … But we will not stand for assaults on police officers … Britain is a nation proudly built on tolerance, diversity and respect. Our flag represents our diverse country and we will never surrender it to those that use it as a symbol of violence, fear and division.”Protesters carried Union Jacks, St George’s flags and large wooden crosses. Some waved placards reading “Stop the boats” and “Save the kids.” One demonstrator held a light-up crucifix, while others displayed images of US activist Charlie Kirk. At Whitehall, the crowd recited the Lord’s Prayer before a Christian rock band performed.Bottles, flares and other projectiles were allegedly thrown as police used batons, shields, horses and dogs to push crowds back. Mounted units and police dogs were deployed.Assistant commissioner Matt Twist said many had protested lawfully but “many came intent on violence”.Business secretary Peter Kyle called Musk’s remarks “slightly incomprehensible and totally inappropriate”. He praised the scale of the rally as proof of free speech but acknowledged Robinson had “tapped into a sense of disquiet and grievance in society”.","US tech billionaire Elon Musk appeared via video link at a far-right rally in London Saturday.

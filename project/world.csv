Hours after Israel withdrew its troops from Gaza City in the opening stage of a US-brokered ceasefire , tens of thousands of Palestinians trudged back to sift through bombed out buildings overseen by Hamas security operatives.The Hamas interior ministry said in a statement on Friday that its police force would deploy across the territory. By Saturday, masked men wearing caps labelled ""Internal Security"" and armed with Kalashnikov assault rifles were inspecting car trunks and reasserting their authority, according to witnesses and images posted on social media and filmed by Al Jazeera.It was an early sign that Israel's goal of removing the Islamist group from power - and US President Donald Trump's aim of a lasting peace - won't be simple. Nor will the task of rebuilding.""Everybody I know has lost their house,"" said Mahmoud Faraj, who left Gaza City with his family last month when Israeli troops took over. Speaking by phone, he said, ""My family is staying in the south of Gaza in their displacement site because there is no home to return to.""The scale of destruction in Gaza City may be slightly less than in the southern part of the coastal enclave but is still massive. Most high-rise buildings have been levelled - Israel says they contained Hamas intelligence infrastructure - and some streets are unrecognisable.Hamas has agreed to free 20 living hostages - and hand over the remains of 28 others - by Monday, when Trump arrives in Jerusalem to address the Parliament before heading to Egypt for a signing ceremony.","Hamas interior ministry said in a statement on Friday that its police force would deploy across the territory.

'NONSENSE': Hamas' Big Attack On Trump's 'PRO-ISRAEL' Plan Hours Before Gaza Hostage Release





A viral video shows NYC mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani being chased from Foley Square by protesters accusing him of antisemitism and demanding he denounce Hezbollah and Sharia law.In the video, Mamdani is seen being escorted by his security through the square toward a waiting vehicle, while a man trails behind shouting, “denounce Hezbollah! denounce Sharia law!”The footage, shared on X, captures protesters surrounding Mamdani as they shout and drum during the tense exchange.Mamdani had been speaking at Foley Square in a show of support for New York Attorney General Letitia James, who was indicted earlier this week on mortgage fraud charges linked to a property she owns in Virginia.The protester appeared to confront Mamdani over his recent remarks marking the second anniversary of Hamas’s October 7 attack, in which he accused the Israeli government of waging a “genocidal war” in Gaza and said the US “has been complicit through it all.”""Two years ago today, Hamas carried out a horrific war crime, killing more than 1,100 Israelis and kidnapping 250 more. I mourn these lives and pray for the safe return of every hostage still held and for every family whose lives were torn apart by these atrocities,"" Mamdani said.Mamdani condemned Israel’s actions in Gaza, citing a death toll exceeding 67,000 and the destruction of homes, hospitals, and schools.""Every day in Gaza has become a place where grief itself has run out of language.I mourn these lives and pray for the families that have been shattered,"" the statement by Mamdani read.Mamdani’s remarks prompted the Israeli foreign ministry to repost his statement on X, accusing him of “acting as a mouthpiece for Hamas propaganda.”""By repeating Hamas’s lies, he excuses terror and normalizes antisemitism. He stands with Jews only when they are dead. Shameful,"" the Israeli foreign ministry said.Mamdani has faced repeated calls to repudiate Hezbollah and condemn slogans like ""Globalize the Intifada.""In a June 2025 appearance on ""Meet the Press,"" he declined to fully comply, stating that policing language is not the role of a public official, while affirming his opposition to incitement to violence and antisemitism, as cited by Fox News.","Video shows NYC mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani being chased from Foley Square by protesters accusing him of antisemitism.

Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy praised his US counterpart Donald Trump for his “outstanding achievement” in securing a Gaza ceasefire during a “very positive and productive” phone call.""I had a call with US President Donald Trump—a very positive and productive one. I congratulated @POTUS on his success and the Middle East deal he was able to secure, which is an outstanding achievement. If a war can be stopped in one region, then surely other wars can be stopped as well—including the Russian war,"" Zelenskyy said through a post on X.The two leaders also discussed Russian strikes on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure and measures to strengthen the country’s air defences, Zelenskyy said, “as well as concrete agreements that we are working on to ensure this.”The leaders also discussed the possible supply of Tomahawk long-range missiles, according to two sources familiar with the matter, as reported by Axios.Tomahawk missiles would enable Ukraine to target deep into Russian territory, including Moscow, with Kyiv arguing they could pressure Putin to come to the negotiating table.The call took place a day after Russia carried out a major strike on Ukraine’s energy grid, cutting power in parts of Kyiv and nine other regions, as cited by AFP.Trump, who unveiled the first phase of a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas on Wednesday, previously met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in August but was unable to secure a peace agreement.Relations between the two leaders have improved significantly since their tense televised encounter at the White House in February.Since then, Trump has adopted a tougher stance toward Moscow while showing support for Ukraine. In September, he wrote on Truth Social that Kyiv should seek to “take back” all occupied territory with the backing of Europe and Nato.On Friday, US First Lady Melania Trump announced she had facilitated the release of Ukrainian children abducted by Russia, using an extraordinary back channel to communicate directly with Putin.",Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy praised his US counterpart Donald Trump for his “outstanding achievement” in securing a Gaza ceasefire.

‘Do you want her to live?’ Teen’s chilling words to sister



‘Cleaning,’ said the accused as mother entered blood-soaked home



Mother blames medical system for failure



‘We ask the public to withhold judgment’







A Staten Island mother has described in harrowing detail how her mentally ill son allegedly killed and decapitated her boyfriend in their home earlier this week - an act she believes could have been prevented if his medical treatment had been properly managed.According to The New York Post, 19-year-old Damien Hurstel confessed to stabbing and beheading his mother’s live-in boyfriend, Anthony Casalaspro, 45, inside their family apartment on Cary Avenue in West Brighton on Monday. Police have charged him with second-degree murder, manslaughter, and criminal possession of a weapon.Authorities said the crime scene showed Casalaspro’s severed head beside his torso in a walk-in shower, with a saw, a bowl, and a spoon nearby. The Post reported that the handle of a silver-colored spoon was sticking out of the dismembered skull.In an interview with The Post, Hurstel’s mother Alicia Zayas recounted how her 16-year-old daughter, Bri, came face to face with her blood-soaked brother just moments after the killing.“She said, ‘Are you gonna hurt mom?’” Zayas recalled her daughter asking. “And he said, ‘Do you want her to live?’ And she said, ‘Yes, please.’He said, ‘Okay, she’ll live.’”Bri then asked if she could leave the blood-splattered bathroom where, according to police sources cited by The Post, the victim’s brain had been partially removed with a spoon. “Are you gonna tell mom?” Damien asked his sister. “No,” she replied.Bri fled the apartment, hid behind a backyard shed, and immediately called her mother. “She called me scared,” Zayas said. “I could hear it in her voice. I said, ‘Are you somewhere safe?’ She said, ‘Damien killed Anthony, and he doesn’t have a head.’”Zayas told The Post she rushed home to find the front door open. Before going inside, she warned her daughter, “If you don’t hear from me in two minutes, you need to call 911. Tell them to come quickly.”Inside, she saw blood everywhere. Her son was in the kitchen. “His eyes looked different,” she recalled. “He has light eyes. The eyes looked dark. It looked weird. I said, ‘Damien, what’s going on? What’s wrong, honey? What are you doing?’”“Cleaning,” Damien responded flatly, “as if he’s cleaning dishes, like it’s normal,” she said.When Zayas asked where Casalaspro was, her son told her, “He’s in the bathroom. But you don’t want to go in there.”“I said, ‘Well, Damien, I have to go in there. I have to see Anthony,’” she remembered. She walked slowly toward the bathroom, too frightened to turn her back to him.“There’s blood everywhere,” she said. “I saw the scene and started screaming, ‘Why? Why? Why? Why? He loves you. Why would you do this?’”Zayas called 911. “Come quick,” she told the dispatcher. “My son killed my boyfriend. They said, ‘Can he be saved? … How do you know he’s dead?’ I said, ‘He has no head.’”She then ran outside to wait for police and pleaded with responding officers not to harm her son.Zayas told The Post that her son’s actions stemmed from untreated and mishandled mental illness. She said doctors had changed his medication in January without informing her, discontinuing Depakote, an antipsychotic he had been taking for years.She discovered the change only when a CVS pharmacist told her Damien needed to be weaned off the old drug slowly. “Why wouldn’t they tell us?” Zayas said. “They’re doctors. I’m sure they knew.”Once Damien turned 18, his psychiatrist refused to share treatment details with her due to privacy laws. “I didn’t even know what doctors he was going to,” Zayas said. “I don’t even know if he was going to all the appointments. Every morning I remind him to take his medications. He said he was taking it.”Zayas said her son began showing mental health issues at age six, after his father went to prison. At 13, after being sexually abused by another student, he started hallucinating and was diagnosed with PTSD and major depression. “He saw shadow figures, very disturbing images, almost like horror movies,” she said. “He would draw them for me.”He was first prescribed antipsychotics at that time and was hospitalized twice after suicide attempts. By 14, she said, he was stable and on medication. “I’m just devastated,” she said. “My son wasn’t like this before. He was a good boy. Something is seriously wrong with him.”She added that Damien could sometimes be violent - once assaulting her on her birthday when she asked him to clean the kitchen - but insisted her boyfriend, Casalaspro, “was not abusive.”Zayas’ attorneys, Mark Fonte and Louis Gelormino, said their firm is working to obtain Damien’s psychiatric records to understand what led to the killing. “We ask the public to withhold judgment,” said Gelormino. “Damien Hurstel is an extremely troubled young man with a long documented history of mental health issues.”Zayas said she and Casalaspro, a city sanitation worker, had been planning to buy a home together. “I’m heartbroken,” she said. “Anthony was a great man. He was helping me raise my kids. He didn’t have to do that.”","Damien Hurstel, 19, confessed to stabbing and beheading his mother's live-in boyfriend, Anthony Casalaspro, 45, inside their family apartment on Cary Avenue in West Brighton on Monday.

'Democracy Under Siege': Ex-US Official Slams Trump's 'Enemy Within' Barb, Crackdown On Dissent

Who is Letitia James?







New York Attorney General Letitia James, who was indicted on charges of bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution, said that she is a ""fearless"" person.Calling the charges of bank fraud ""baseless,"" James referred to a civil fraud lawsuit she successfully filed against President Donald Trump and his company for alleged fraudulent business practices, which resulted in a fine of approximately $465 million being overturned by an appeals court in August.The statement also mentioned the resignation of US Attorney Erik Siebert, who departed his position after President Trump criticised him for not bringing charges against James and former FBI Director James Comey. Comey was indicted last month following the appointment of US Attorney Lindsey Halligan, Axios reported.James said, ""This is nothing more than a continuation of the president's desperate weaponization of our justice system. He is forcing federal law enforcement agencies to do his bidding, all because I did my job as the New York State Attorney General."" She continued, ""These charges are baseless, and the president's own public statements make clear that his only goal is political retribution at any cost. The president's actions are a grave violation of our Constitutional order and have drawn sharp criticism from members of both parties.Regarding Siebert, James said, ""His decision to fire a United States Attorney who refused to bring charges against me—and replace them with someone who is blindly loyal not to the law, but to the president—is antithetical to the bedrock principles of our country."" She added, ""This is the time for leaders on both sides of the aisle to speak out against this blatant perversion of our system of justice.""The Attorney General concluded, ""I stand strongly behind my office's litigation against the Trump Organization. We conducted a two-year investigation based on the facts and evidence—not politics. Judges have upheld the trial court's finding that Donald Trump, his company, and his two sons are liable for fraud.""""I am a proud woman of faith, and I know that faith and fear cannot share the same space. And so today I am not fearful, I am fearless, and as my faith teaches me, no weapon formed against me shall prosper. We will fight these baseless charges aggressively, and my office will continue to fiercely protect New Yorkers and their rights. And I will continue to do my job.""In response, Halligan stated, ""No one is above the law. The charges as alleged in this case represent intentional, criminal acts and tremendous breaches of the public's trust. The facts and the law in this case are clear.""Letitia “Tish” James is the 67th Attorney General for the state of New York. Elected in 2018, she became the first woman of colour to hold statewide office in New York and the first woman to be elected Attorney General. James brings decades of experience and a strong record of achievements to her role as a powerful and effective attorney.Prior to her current position, she was the public advocate for the City of New York. Elected in 2013, she became the first woman of colour to hold citywide office. During her tenure, her office passed more legislation than all previous public advocates combined, including a groundbreaking law that banned questions about salary history from the employment process to address the pervasive gender wage gap.Before serving as public advocate, James represented the 35th Council District in Brooklyn in the New York City Council for ten years. As a council member, she passed the Safe Housing Act, legislation that required landlords to improve living conditions for tenants in New York City’s worst buildings.Prior to her election to the City Council, James was head of the Brooklyn Regional Office of the New York State Attorney General’s Office. James began her career as a public defender at the Legal Aid Society. A proud Brooklynite, she is a graduate of Lehman College and Howard University School of Law.","New York Attorney General Letitia James was indicted on charges of bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution.

Elusive figure





WASHINGTON: US First Lady Melania Trump said Friday she had secured the release of Ukrainian children abducted by Russia after establishing an extraordinary back channel of communication with President Vladimir Putin In a rare public announcement at the White House, she revealed weeks of behind the scenes diplomacy with the Kremlin chief after he held a summit in Alaska with her husband, US President Donald Trump.Eight children displaced by Moscow's 2022 invasion of Ukraine had been returned to their homes in the last 24 hours, she said.The 55-year-old said that Putin had agreed to help after she passed him a letter through Trump at the summit, a meeting which otherwise ended without a breakthrough in resolving the war now in its fourth year.""Much has unfolded since President Putin received my letter last August. He responded in writing signalling a willingness to engage with me directly and outlining details regarding the Ukrainian children residing in Russia,"" she told reporters.""Since then, President Putin and I have had an open channel of communication regarding the welfare of these children.""The Slovenian-born former model said that both sides had also had ""several back channel meetings and calls, all in good faith.""""My representative has been working directly with President Putin's team to ensure the safe reunification of children with their families between Russia and Ukraine,"" she said.""In fact, eight children have been rejoined with their families during the past 24 hours.""Seven of them were returned to Ukraine from Russia, she said, while one young girl went back to Russia from Ukraine.Three were separated from their parents and ""displaced to the Russian Federation by frontline fighting,"" she said.The others including the girl returned to Russia were ""separated from family members across borders"" by the conflict.Kyiv has accused Moscow of abducting almost 20,000 children from parts of the east and south of Ukraine after Moscow's troops invaded in February 2022.Ukraine has made the issue of the abducted children a diplomatic priority.The International Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant for Putin and his children's rights commissioner, Maria Lvova-Belova, over the allegations of child abductions.Russia has said it moved some Ukrainian children from their houses or orphanages for protection due to the threat of hostilities.Melania Trump said in her announcement that Russia had ""demonstrated a willingness"" to share details to identify abducted children, including biographies and photos.She said she would continue to work for more children to return to their homes.""This is an important initiative for me. It is built on shared purpose and lasting impact,"" she added.The announcement marked a rare glimmer of progress in the Ukraine war, which Trump vowed to solve within 24 hours of taking office but now admits is the most difficult conflict he has tried to solve.It was also a rare solo appearance by Melania Trump, who has been an elusive figure at the White House since her husband's return to power in January, preferring to spend her time in New York or Florida.But she has highlighted a number of initiatives, often involving children.Melania also accompanied her husband on his state visit to Britain in September, making a joint appearance with Princess Catherine, wife of heir to the throne Prince William.",Melania Trump says she has secured the release of Ukrainian children abducted by Russia.

But lately, it has cropped up in a less warm and fuzzy context: to refer to people clinging anxiously to their jobs in a murky market.Workers are quitting at much lower rates than they were a few years ago, and are instead ""job hugging."" In August, consulting firm Korn Ferry used the term in an article to describe the way workers have been ""holding on to their jobs for dear life."" A spokesperson wrote in an email that the firm might have coined the phrase but that he couldn't say for sure. Since then, it has popped up in several news articles and even on ""The Daily Show. ""The term is striking a nerve partly because it represents a sharp reversal from the ""great resignation"" period of 2021 and 2022, when tens of millions of Americans quit their jobs. At the time, the labor market was hot, after a steep decline in employment at the start of the pandemic.But the market has again cooled significantly. Employers added a measly 22,000 jobs in August, according to the latest federal data. In June, the US economy lost 13,000 jobs, its first dip since December 2020, according to revised data.Hiring is down in many industries. Unemployment, though low overall, is hitting recent college graduates hard.The job market is filled with distressing signals and uncertainty. Tariffs are hobbling companies. Immigration raids are decimating the workforces of some industries and igniting fear in communities. Artificial intelligence is spooking everyone (though Yale researchers found that so far, few workers have been displaced by AI). Quits reflect workers' confidence -- and at the moment, they do not seem particularly confident.""Unless you have a better option, quitting a job in risky times is a huge gamble,"" Nick Bloom, an economist at Stanford, said in an email.When they can't quit, employees may end up feeling stuck in place, which can stunt their career development, said Peter Cappelli, a professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. The situation can also hurt their financial health because job hoppers tend to get higher raises.For the most part, workers leave jobs once they have secured a better opportunity. ""Almost nobody quits and then pouts and goes home and then thinks, 'Gee, what am I going to do next?'"" Cappelli said. But when workers don't leave, other people can't fill those roles, stalling movement in the job market.Though worker turnover is expensive for employers, having a team of stressed employees who don't want to be there isn't ideal, either. ""Churn"" is a bad word among bosses, but some amount of it can be healthy.On paper, this job market is more ""normal"" than the overheated one of the early 2020s. Still, many of the dynamics today -- the Trump administration's immigration offensive, the hyped-up AI market, the psychic scars of the early pandemic shutdowns and the years of scarce labor that followed -- make for an uneasy time.Stressed-out workers may find comfort in embracing a loved one amid the uncertainty. A job, for all the stability it provides, cannot hug you back.","Workers are quitting at much lower rates than they were a few years ago.

Mike Jhonson 'Exposes' Democrats On Day 10 Of US Govt Shutdown | Watch





President Donald Trump has directed the Pentagon to use all available funds to ensure that US troops receive their paychecks on October 15, despite the ongoing government shutdown, triggered by a standoff between Republicans and Democrats. In a statement posted on Truth Social, Trump criticised Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer and the Democrats for the impasse, accusing them of holding the military and national security “hostage.”Trump said, “Every day gets better” - a remark by Schumer - is “wrong,” warning that without action from the Democrats, troops could miss their pay, “I DISAGREE! If nothing is done, because of ‘Leader’ Chuck Schumer and the Democrats, our Brave Troops will miss the paychecks they are rightfully due on October 15th,” Trump wrote.He added, “That is why I am using my authority, as Commander in Chief, to direct our Secretary of War, Pete Hegseth, to use all available funds to get our Troops PAID on October 15th. We have identified funds to do this, and Secretary Hegseth will use them to PAY OUR TROOPS.”Trump reiterated his stance against the government shutdown and urged the Democrats to reopen the government before working on issues such as healthcare, which he said they want to “destroy”.“The Radical Left Democrats should OPEN THE GOVERNMENT, and then we can work together to address Healthcare, and many other things that they want to destroy,” he said.Schumer’s comment- “each day our case to fix healthcare and end the shutdown gets better and better and stronger and stronger”- was made on Thurdsay on the Senate floor, where he attempted to strike a confident tone regarding Democrats' position in the ongoing negotiations over federal funding.However, the remark triggered sharp reactions across the Republican spectrum. Senate majority leader John Thune said, “Democrats couldn’t care less whether military families miss a paycheck tomorrow”. He further criticised Democrats saying “it isn’t a political game”.The government shutdown, triggered by the failure of Congress to agree on funding, has raised concerns about its impact on federal employees and military personnel, with October 15 marking the next scheduled payday for troops.This move by Trump highlights ongoing political tensions in Washington as the shutdown continues. The Pentagon has yet to publicly confirm details regarding the funding directive.","President Donald Trump has directed the Pentagon to use all available funds to ensure that US troops receive their paychecks on October 15.

US military plant explosion: ‘No survivors’ found after Tennessee blast; at least 16 presumed dead,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-military-plant-explosion-no-survivors-found-after-tennessee-blast-at-least-16-presumed-dead/articleshow/124486925.cms,"Debris after blast (AP)

Tennessee Bomb Factory Blast: All 19 Workers Presumed Dead In Shocking Explosion





Investigators now say a massive explosion at a Tennessee military explosives facility killed 16 people, officials announced Saturday.Earlier reports had listed 18 people as missing following Friday’s blast, but Humphreys County Sheriff Chris Davis clarified at a press conference that two individuals, whose vehicles and personal items were found at the site, were not present when the explosion occurred.The blast occurred around 7:45am local time during an early shift, destroying an entire building on the plant’s campus and scattering debris over at least half a square mile. Residents reported feeling the impact up to 20 miles away, with several mistaking the tremors for an earthquake or meteor strike.“It’s not like working an accident. It’s not like working a tornado. We’re dealing with explosions. And I would say at this time, we’re dealing with remains,” Davis said.Authorities are now using cell tower data and employee records to confirm who was on site at the time of the incident. The FBI and the bureau of alcohol, tobacco, firearms and explosives (ATF) have joined the investigation, which will be co-led by local sheriff’s offices.The cause of the explosion remains unknown, and officials said the site remains volatile due to leftover ordnance and unstable chemicals. Controlled detonations are expected as part of the recovery and safety measures.AES manufactures explosives primarily for the US military, including demolition charges and bulk munitions. The company has received several defense contracts, largely from the US army and navy, according to public records. It operates an eight-building facility in a heavily wooded area of Humphreys county.A vigil was held Friday night by community members who gathered to pray and sing hymns like “Amazing Grace.” Sheriff Davis, visibly moved, spoke of the broader impact on the tight-knit community. “We need our communities to come together and understand that we’ve lost a lot of people. This does not only affect those families, it runs deeper … this could be people that you grew up with,” he said.The company, in a statement, called it a “tragic accident” and thanked first responders, “Our thoughts and prayers are with the families, coworkers, and community members affected by this incident,” said Wendall Stinson, CEO of AES.In 2019, AES was cited by OSHA for minor violations related to chemical safety and radiation exposure, according to AP records. The area has also witnessed industrial accidents in the past - including a fatal explosion at another local ammunition facility in 2014.Tennessee governor Bill Lee posted on social media asking for prayers and confirming he is closely monitoring the situation.(With inputs from agencies and CNN)","The blast occurred around 7:45am local time during an early shift, destroying an entire building on the plant’s campus.

A community gathering that began as a festive, peaceful homecoming event ended in tragedy on Friday night, after gunfire erupted near midnight in the small town of Leland, Mississippi, killing four people and injuring at least 12 others.The shooting occurred on Main Street, shortly after a homecoming football game and tailgate hosted by Leland High School, officials said. While the event initially wrapped up without incident, celebrations later moved into the heart of town for a community block party - a long-standing tradition - when violence suddenly broke out.“All of the victims are adults,” local officials said, with several identified as recent graduates of Leland High School who had returned home for the annual reunion, reported The New York Post.Four of the wounded were airlifted to nearby hospitals, including Baptist Medical Center in Jackson. Their medical conditions have not been disclosed. As of now, no suspects have been identified or taken into custody. The Mississippi bureau of investigation is assisting with the probe.Leland Mayor John Lee, who took office in June, expressed shock over the incident.“We solicit prayers for our community from people across the world that’s hearing this information,” Lee said.“We’re not a city of high crime. It’s very, very low crime here. Everybody knows everybody, we all get along well and we’re just devastated by this event.”School Superintendent Jessie King, who was present at the tailgate and game earlier in the evening, described the atmosphere before the violence as entirely calm.“This year’s party had been ‘picture perfect’ and showed no indication of the violence that was to come,” King told The Post.“We left there believing we’d check this one off for one in the books,” she said. “No issues whatsoever. No triggers, no warnings that something like this would take place. The football game and the tailgate on the campus - everyone was having a good time and it closed down in good spirits.”The annual homecoming event typically draws hundreds of visitors to the town and serves as an informal reunion for former students, who often bring college friends along. This year was no exception.Late NFL linebacker Johnie Cooks, a Leland High School alumnus and former New York Giants Super Bowl champion, was a regular at the event. Cooks passed away in 2023 at the age of 64 after suffering a stroke.Friday’s incident marks the second mass shooting in Mississippi that night linked to high school football games. In Heidelberg, about 200 miles away, another shooting left two dead and one injured following a game.Authorities have not yet confirmed what led to the Leland shooting.","The shooting occurred on Main Street, shortly after a homecoming football game and tailgate hosted by Leland High School, officials said.

'Somebody Is Not...': Trump’s Fiery Reaction To Biden’s Cancer News





Former US president Joe Biden is receiving radiation and hormone treatments for prostate cancer discovered in May, according to a spokesperson's statement on Saturday.""As part of a treatment plan for prostate cancer, President Biden is currently undergoing radiation therapy and hormone treatment,"" the spokesperson confirmed, as quoted by AFP.The 82-year-old former president's office revealed in May that Biden had been diagnosed with aggressive prostate cancer that had spread to his bones, following urinary symptoms and the discovery of a prostate nodule. ""Cancer touches us all. Like so many of you, Jill and I have learned that we are strongest in the broken places,"" Biden, whose son Beau Biden succumbed to cancer in 2015, wrote on X platform at the time.""Thank you for lifting us up with love and support,"" he added (at the time).Biden's health became a significant concern following a publication that alleged his deteriorating condition during his campaign for a second presidential term against Donald Trump In July 2024, following a poor debate performance against Trump, Biden withdrew from the race and supported vice president Kamala Harris's presidential bid. Harris subsequently lost to Trump, who commenced his second term in January.The American Cancer Society identifies prostate cancer as the most prevalent cancer among men.The condition is notably frequent in elderly men, with studies indicating approximately 80 percent of men over 80 have cancerous cells in their prostate gland.Despite being highly treatable when detected early, it ranks as the second leading cause of cancer mortality in men, according to the organisation. Hormone therapy, while effective in reducing tumours and slowing cancer progression, does not provide a cure.","Former US president Joe Biden is receiving radiation and hormone treatments for prostate cancer.

'Corn Pop': Activists strip at Maine School board meeting to protest trans-inclusive sports policy — Video,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/corn-pop-activists-strip-at-maine-school-board-meeting-to-protest-trans-inclusive-sports-policy-video/articleshow/124473355.cms,"



Three activists stripped down to their underwear during a Maine school board meeting to protest the district’s trans-inclusive sports policy.The eyebrow-raising protest, led by local firebrand Nick Blanchard (who fittingly goes by “Corn Pop”), took place in Augusta as two women and a man slowly disrobed while Blanchard delivered a dramatic speech.Two women and a man slowly and perfunctorily removed their clothes at the close of the Augusta School Department meeting as Blanchard, who goes by the name “Corn Pop,” delivered an impassioned monologue.“I’m about to show you guys how uncomfortable it is for girls,” Blanchard said as the women disrobed. Two individuals stood in the school board meeting with their shirts removed while board members sat behind a curved wooden desk.“You feel uncomfortable? Because that’s what these young girls feel like when a boy walks into their locker room and starts changing in front of them. That’s what these young girls feel like every time a young boy changes in front of them.” The stunt elicited a range of responses from the school board members, with some outraged, a few averting their gaze, and others remaining entirely unbothered.“This is Maine’s capital,” Blanchard continued. “We should be setting an example for the rest of the state.You know what example you guys are setting? That we do not care about the young girls in the rest of the state.” Following the protest going viral locally, Blanchard stated that more than 150 people have contacted him in support of his stance on the Title IX policy, Central Maine reported.“Do I think these tactics work in a way of changing policy? Probably not,” Blanchard told the outlet.“But the only way to get them to listen to us is to do something crazy and get in the national spotlight.” The Augusta school board voted in favour of their current policy, which adheres to the Maine Human Rights Act. That law allows a student athlete to participate on the team that corresponds with their gender identity, WGME reported.President Trump signed an executive order in February aimed at keeping biological men out of women’s sports through Title IX.The Maine demonstration follows a similar stripping protest in California. Local mother Beth Bourne, who chairs the group Moms for Liberty, undressed down to her underwear at a Davis Joint Unified School Board meeting on September 18 to protest the allowance of transgender students to use girls’ locker rooms.Multiple individual school districts in both Maine and California have passed resolutions to support compliance with Trump’s executive order, Fox News reported.","Nick Blanchard, who goes by Corn Pop, led the protest in Augusta, Maine.

Who is Portland Frog?

What is the Portland Frog ?



There is a Portland Chicken







As US President Donald Trump deploys the National Guard to Portland and Chicago in search of unrest, local residents have countered with humor, none more striking than a protester in Portland, Oregon, who showed up in an inflatable frog costume.Dubbed the “Portland Frog,” the demonstrator has since gone viral, with videos and photos flooding social media.Portland residents have taken to wearing inflatable costumes to mock what one frog-costumed protester described as “insane government overreach.”""It is a strategy to cut the narratives of the Trump administration, which says we are extremely violent. No, we are protesting, but with humor,"" said Seth Todd, who wears the frog costume, as reported by Le Monde.On October 2, Todd joined protesters outside the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention center to oppose the expulsion of undocumented migrants from Portland. During the demonstration, police fired tear gas into the vent of his frog costume as he attempted to assist fellow activists being targeted by law enforcement.Protesters are using the tools at their disposal, smartphone cameras, social media, and satire, to turn “war” rhetoric into a punchline.The dress-up “dismantles their narrative a little bit,” said Jack Dickinson, who dressed up as a Chicken, as cited by Willamette Week.“It becomes much harder to take them seriously when they have to post a video saying Kristi Noem is up on the balcony staring over the Antifa Army and it’s, like, eight journalists and five protesters and one of them is in a chicken suit,"" he added.Local Oregon officials remain united in asserting that the situation does not warrant deployment of the National Guard. On October 4 and 5, federal Judge Karin Immergut issued two rulings blocking the president’s order to send in troops, at least until October 18.""This is an American city. We do not need any intervention. This is not a military target. The president will not find lawlessness or violence here,"" the city's mayor, Keith Wilson, said in a statement.","Protesters in Portland, Oregon, have taken to wearing inflatable frog costumes to mock what one protester described as “insane government overreach.” The dress-up “dismantles their narrative a little bit,” said Jack Dickinson, who dressed up as a Chicken.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124473159,imgsize-639881,width-400,resizemode-4/image-xwutangkids.jpg"

Hamas' Power Move: Shifts Hostages To Secure Gaza Locations Before Signing Trump Peace Plan | Report

Poll Do you believe the US troops' arrival in Israel will help achieve lasting peace in Gaza? Yes No

Gazans on their way home







US troops began arriving in Israel overnight as part of a mission to help implement and oversee the Gaza ceasefire agreement, a source was quoted as saying by ABC News.Admiral Brad Cooper, head of the US Central Command, arrived in Israel on Thursday.According to the report, the 200-member team is set to arrive over the weekend, traveling from the US and other bases across the Middle East. Officials stated that US personnel will help establish a joint control center, coordinate the various security forces entering Gaza, and liaise with the Israel Defense Forces.Officials said US Central Command will set up a “civil-military coordination center” in Israel to help manage the delivery of humanitarian aid, as well as provide logistical and security support to the region devastated by two years of conflict, as cited by AP.The US role is to establish a Joint Control Center to coordinate and integrate the multinational force entering Gaza.Egyptian, Qatari, Turkish, and likely Emirati military officials will be part of the team, which is expected to be based in Egypt. Officials have emphasized that no US troops are planned to enter Gaza.Thousands of displaced Palestinians began returning on foot to the ruins of their homes in Gaza on Friday, following a ceasefire and the initial Israeli withdrawal under the first phase of a war-ending agreement.A long column of people moved north along the coastal road toward Gaza City, the enclave’s largest urban center, which had faced heavy attacks in one of Israel’s most intense offensives of the conflict.""Thank God my house is still standing,"" Ismail Zayda, a resident of Gaza City was quoted as saying by Reuters. ""But the place is destroyed, my neighbours' houses are destroyed, entire districts have gone.""Although a ceasefire was in place, Israeli troops remained in roughly half of the Gaza Strip, with certain areas still off-limits, an Israeli military spokesperson warned.Palestinians heading north reported walking for hours under the watch of Israeli drones and hearing distant explosions.“I managed to reach the outskirts of Beit Lahia but could not move toward the centre because of the danger still present. Drones started firing at anyone who advanced toward the city,” Zuheir, a 34-year-old nurse, was quoted as saying by the Guardian.Palestinian health authorities reported that medical teams recovered 100 bodies across Gaza following the Israeli withdrawal.As residents returned home, uncertainty remained over whether the ceasefire and hostage-prisoner exchange between Israel and Hamas, the most significant step yet toward ending two years of conflict, would result in lasting peace under US President Donald Trump’s 20-point plan.","The 200-member team is set to arrive over the weekend, traveling from the US and other bases across the Middle East.

PESHAWAR: Seven policemen were killed and 13 others injured in a terrorist attack at a police training centre in Pakistan 's restive Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, the army said on Saturday.The attack took place late Friday night when seven to eight terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) launched a coordinated assault using heavy weapons on the Dera Ismail Khan Police Training Centre in the DI Khan district, near the South Waziristan border.On the intervening night of October 10-11, terrorists attempted to breach the perimeter of the police training school by ramming an explosives-laden truck into its main gate, triggering a massive explosion, the army said in a statement.While one policeman was killed in the attack, six others died in the retaliatory exchange of fire between the security personnel and the terrorists.After the intense five-hour engagement, six terrorists were also eliminated, the army said.During the exchange of fire, the militants continued throwing hand grenades.A mosque inside the institute complex was targeted by the terrorists.

Pakistan Panics After Taliban Issues Warning, Accuses India of Using Afghanistan Soil for Terror





Pakistan has lodged formal objections with Afghanistan’s Ambassador in Islamabad over several ‘elements of the India‑Afghanistan joint statement’, particularly the reference to Jammu and Kashmir as 'part of India'.It also rejected remarks by Afghan foreign minister Mawlawi Amir Khan Muttaqi that “terrorism is an internal problem of Pakistan,” the Pakistani ministry of foreign affairs (MOFA) said.The foreign office said: “It was conveyed that the reference to Jammu and Kashmir as part of India is in clear violation of the relevant UN Security Council resolutions and the legal status of Jammu and Kashmir. The Joint Statement is highly insensitive to the sacrifices and sentiments of the people of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir in their just struggle for the right to self‑determination.”In addition, Islamabad strongly rebutted Muttaqi’s claim, saying: “Pakistan has repeatedly shared details regarding the presence of Fitna‑e‑Khawarij and Fitna‑e‑Hindustan terrorist elements operating from Afghan soil against Pakistan with support from elements within Afghanistan.”The Pakistani statement added that deflecting responsibility by branding terrorism in Pakistan as an ""internal matter"" does not relieve Afghanistan’s interim government of its duty to ensure regional peace and security.It also urged that “unauthorised Afghan nationals residing in Pakistan” return to their country.These protests follow a joint statement issued on October 10 during Muttaqi’s visit to India, where both nations reiterated condemnation of terrorism emanating from regional countries, affirmed respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, and affirmed that the Afghan government would not permit any group or individual to use Afghan territory against India.In that statement, external affairs minister S Jaishankar expressed gratitude for Afghanistan’s condemnation of the April 22 terrorist attack in Pahalgam, Jammu & Kashmir, while Afghanistan reaffirmed its support in counterterrorism.""Both sides emphasised respect for each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The external affairs minister appreciated the Afghan side's understanding of India's security concerns. The Afghan foreign minister reiterated the commitment that the Afghan government will not allow any group or individual to use the territory of Afghanistan against India,"" the statement issued by the ministry of external affairs (MEA) read.Muttaqi is on a week-long visit to India (October 9–16), the first such high-level visit since the Taliban takeover in 2021.

Strategic hedging, not endorsement







NEW DELHI: In a diplomatic manoeuvre that could reshape regional equations, India announced on Friday that it will upgrade its technical mission in Kabul to a full-fledged embassy. The decision was announced during Taliban foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi’s high-profile visit to New Delhi. On the same day, the Afghan foreign minister, from Indian soil, condemned Pakistan for bombing civilian areas in Paktika, Afghanistan — the first of its kind that came against the backdrop of escalating tensions between Kabul and Islamabad.During the meetings, external affairs minister S Jaishankar underlined that India’s engagement “contributes to Afghanistan’s national development, as well as regional stability and resilience,” while announcing a fresh round of development projects across Afghan provinces. The upgrade of India’s technical mission to a full-fledged embassy signals a significant deepening of diplomatic ties without extending formal recognition to the Taliban regime.Later the same day, Muttaqi held a press briefing in New Delhi, sharply condemning Pakistan for bombing civilian areas in Paktika, calling it a “provocative act” and a violation of Afghanistan’s sovereignty. “Such issues cannot be resolved by strength.Countries with disputes should resolve them internally. Peace and prosperity are good for all,” he said, stressing the widening rift between Kabul and Islamabad.India had shut its Kabul embassy in August 2021 after the Taliban’s return to power, maintaining only a skeletal presence through a technical team since June 2022 to oversee humanitarian aid. The embassy upgrade marks the deepest level of engagement between India and the Taliban since the fall of the Ashraf Ghani government. This move stops short of formal recognition but signals a decisive shift in India’s Afghanistan strategy.The timing of the announcement was significant. It came just hours after Afghanistan’s defence ministry accused Pakistan of bombing civilian areas in Paktika near the Durand Line. “Pakistan violated Afghanistan’s airspace, bombing a civilian market in the Marghi area of Paktika near the Durand Line and also violating Kabul’s sovereign territory,” the ministry said in a post on social media. Calling it “an unprecedented, violent, and provocative act”, Kabul warned that defending its territory is its right.From Indian soil, Muttaqi chose to respond sharply. “I think it’s a wrong step by the Pakistan government. Such issues cannot be resolved by strength. Countries with disputes should resolve them internally. Peace and prosperity are good for all,” he told reporters in Delhi. “Some attacks happened in border areas, and we condemn them. We have opened doors for dialogue and diplomacy.”The unusually strong language stressed the widening rift between the Taliban and Pakistan, their uneasy patron for decades. Relations have deteriorated over Islamabad’s military operations against Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) fighters allegedly sheltering in Afghanistan. In March 2024, Pakistani airstrikes in Khost and Paktika killed several civilians, triggering warnings from Kabul of “consequences”. This fracture, analysts say, has created a new strategic opening for India.India has historically had a fraught relationship with the Taliban. During the 1990s, New Delhi backed the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance while Islamabad openly supported the Taliban regime. After 2001, India became one of Afghanistan’s largest regional donors, pledging over USD 3 billion for development projects. But the Taliban’s return to power in 2021 disrupted India’s presence and leverage in the country. New Delhi maintained limited contact, focusing on humanitarian assistance and regional coordination with Iran and Central Asian partners.Now, with Pakistan–Taliban ties fraying, India is recalibrating. By reopening its embassy, hosting Muttaqi, and accepting Taliban-appointed diplomats (though not at the ambassadorial level), India is signalling a willingness to engage without granting formal recognition. Strategic analysts describe this as “hedging” — positioning itself to gain influence should Pakistan’s grip weaken further, while safeguarding its own security concerns.Professor Rajan Kumar of the School of International Studies at Jawaharlal Nehru University says this evolving situation presents India with a rare diplomatic opening.“The ongoing conflict with Afghanistan and Pakistan certainly offers an opportunity for India can be a stabilising factor even in the ongoing conflict with Pakistan. India’s presence matters a lot to Afghanistan because it will provide some kind of legitimacy to the Taliban government, even though India is unlikely to recognise the regime as such,” he says.The engagement carried clear economic undertones as well. Muttaqi invited Indian companies to invest in Afghanistan’s mining sector and called for the opening of the Attari–Wagah border for direct India–Afghanistan trade. “Pakistan and India should open the Wagah border to facilitate trade between Afghanistan and India. It will benefit the people of all three countries,” he said.Currently, India trades with Afghanistan primarily via Iran’s Chabahar port due to Pakistan’s denial of overland access. But the route faces uncertainty after the United States revoked India’s sanctions waiver for Chabahar in September 2024, complicating transit. While Chabahar remains a strategic hedge, its operational limitations make direct India–Afghanistan connectivity via Pakistan attractive in theory — though politically fraught.India also announced a new slate of development projects: a Thalassemia Centre and 30-bed hospital in Bagrami district, oncology and trauma centres in Kabul, maternity clinics across Paktika, Khost and Paktia, and donations of ambulances, medical equipment and vaccines. These announcements draw on India’s legacy of over 500 development projects across all 34 Afghan provinces, including the Parliament building and the Salma Dam.Security remains at the core of India’s engagement. Without naming Pakistan, both sides “unequivocally condemned all acts of terrorism emanating from regional countries” in their joint statement. Jaishankar said, “We have a common commitment towards growth and prosperity. However, these are endangered by the shared threat of cross-border terrorism that both our nations face. We must coordinate efforts to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.” Muttaqi, meanwhile, pledged that Afghanistan “won’t allow any group to use the country against others”, identifying Daesh (ISIS) as the main regional threat.For India, the key is ensuring Afghan soil is not used for anti-India activities — a core concern since the IC-814 hijacking in 1999. Prof. Kumar explains this strategic bottom line:“What can happen, and what India is probably thinking, is that the land of Afghanistan may not be used for terrorist activities against India. That would be a huge achievement from the Indian perspective,” he says.India has so far avoided pressing the Taliban hard on human rights. Muttaqi remained vague when asked about women’s rights, saying, “All countries have their own customs and traditions and these should be respected.” While India has consistently raised rights issues at multilateral forums, officials have avoided making them a precondition for engagement.Perhaps the most consequential element of India’s strategy is its decision to reopen its embassy in Kabul without formally recognising the Taliban regime — a nuanced diplomatic line that gives New Delhi both flexibility and leverage. By restoring a physical diplomatic presence, India can deepen engagement on the ground and signal its relevance in Afghanistan’s evolving power dynamics, without extending official legitimacy to a government that remains internationally unrecognised and controversial for its human rights record.This approach reflects a clear distinction between establishing an embassy and granting diplomatic recognition. India has previously maintained similar diplomatic arrangements, such as with Palestine, where the presence of an embassy does not automatically translate into full diplomatic recognition of a government. In the Afghan context, this allows India to engage pragmatically while aligning its policy with the broader stance of the United Nations, the European Union and Western countries, most of which have opted for functional engagement without recognition.By doing so, New Delhi positions itself strategically. It can build channels of communication, potentially shape outcomes on critical security and connectivity issues, and apply pressure on regional actors like Pakistan and China, both of which are wary of India expanding its influence in Afghanistan. At the same time, India avoids prematurely endorsing a regime whose policies on women’s rights and governance remain at odds with international norms.India’s outreach is also informed by broader regional considerations. Russia and China have already established working relationships with the Taliban. Western governments are engaged in dialogue on counterterrorism and aid. New Delhi, analysts say, does not want to be the outlier.As Prof. Kumar notes, “Since Russia is talking, China is already there, and American and Western governments are also talking, India should not be left out. We may have ideological differences with the Taliban regime, but since other countries are talking to the Taliban in different forms, we should also try to moderate our policy and engage on several issues.”This balancing act is not without challenges. The Taliban regime remains ideologically rigid, especially on women’s rights and governance. Connectivity through Chabahar faces geopolitical headwinds. And there is no guarantee that the Taliban will limit anti-India groups indefinitely. Yet, by opening formal diplomatic channels, India aims to secure a seat at the table rather than watch from the sidelines as others shape Afghanistan’s future.Muttaqi’s visit to Delhi, marked by strong rhetoric against Pakistan, overtures for trade, and assurances on terrorism, reflects Kabul’s attempt to diversify its diplomatic bets. For India, the outreach is less about endorsing the Taliban regime and more about strategic positioning: insulating itself against security risks, reasserting influence in a region long dominated by Pakistan, and adapting to a shifting geopolitical landscape.New Delhi’s approach remains cautious but deliberate. It is engaging the Taliban to pursue its security and strategic objectives, without abandoning its normative concerns or rushing into recognition. In the complex triangle of India–Afghanistan–Pakistan, this marks the beginning of a new phase — one where India is no longer merely reacting to developments in Kabul, but actively shaping them.","India announced on Friday that it will upgrade its technical mission in Kabul to a full-fledged embassy.

Government response and TLP’s history





Massive protests by the hardline Islamist groupescalated into violent clashes across multiple cities on Friday and Saturday, leaving at least 11 people dead and dozens injured. Demonstrators marched towards Islamabad in what they called a “Gaza March” to express solidarity with Palestinians and planned to stage a protest outside the United States embassy.TLP launched its protests in Lahore on Thursday, announcing plans to march to the US embassy in Islamabad to oppose the US-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Hamas following two years of conflict in Gaza. While the demonstrations were initially organised to challenge the ceasefire, the party said the focus had shifted to expressing solidarity with Palestinians.“We have no demands other than showing solidarity with the people of Gaza,” senior TLP member Allama Muhammad Irfan told AFP as the protesters set off for Islamabad.The rally, led by TLP chief Saad Rizvi, began after Friday prayers from the party’s base on Multan Road in Lahore. Thousands joined, chanting religious slogans and carrying sticks and rods. Police set up barricades and used tear gas at key junctions — including Yateem Khana Chowk, Chauburji, Azadi Chowk, and Shahdara — but protesters broke through, clashing with security forces and pelting stones.Videos on social media showed demonstrators seizing government vehicles and damaging public property.Violence soon spread to Islamabad and Rawalpindi, where authorities placed shipping containers to block roads and fired tear gas to disperse crowds. In return, protesters hurled stones at police. Public life in the twin cities was severely disrupted, with schools shut, the Metro bus service suspended, and mobile internet blocked for a second consecutive day.According to Arab News, TLP claimed that 11 of its supporters had been killed and 50 injured since Thursday, though officials have not commented on the claim. Lahore police confirmed multiple injuries among officers and said more than 100 TLP activists had been arrested for attacking law enforcement and damaging property.Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi warned that no group would be allowed to march on Islamabad “under any circumstances,” while State Minister for Interior Talal Chaudhry accused the TLP of “political blackmail” and misusing religious sentiments. “Peaceful protest is a democratic right,” Chaudhry said, “but there is no room for violence or mob pressure.”Founded in 2015, the TLP has a history of staging disruptive protests on religious and political issues. Since its rise in 2017, the group has repeatedly brought parts of Pakistan to a standstill through mass marches and sit-ins that have paralyzed the capital and major highways for days.",Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) launched protests in Lahore on Thursday.

At Least 24 Killed As Pakistan Air Force Bombs Tirah Village In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa





The Pakistani Taliban, also known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), claimed responsibility for a series of deadly attacks on Friday across northwestern districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, killing 20 security personnel and three civilians.As per news agency AFP, the coordinated assaults included a suicide bombing at a police training school in Dera Ismail Khan district, along with clashes in other districts bordering Afghanistan.Eleven paramilitary troops were killed in the Khyber district, while seven policemen died when a suicide bomber drove an explosives-laden vehicle into the gate of the Dera Ismail Khan police training school, followed by an armed assault.“Seven police personnel were martyred and 13 were injured in the attack, while six terrorists were also killed,” Muhammad Hussain, a senior local police official, was quoted as saying by AFP.In Bajaur district, five people—including three civilians—were killed during clashes between militants and paramilitary forces, AFP reported.Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif strongly condemned the attacks, saying, “Such cowardly acts by terrorists cannot shake our resolve against terrorism.We are determined to completely eliminate terrorism from the country.”Islamabad has accused Afghanistan of allowing militants to operate from its territory, a claim denied by Kabul. Pakistani defence minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif warned, “Everyone will have to bear the consequences, including those providing the hideouts. Enough is enough”, adding that any response could cause collateral damage.Friday’s attacks reflect a surge in militancy in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa since the US-led troop withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021.As per news agency AP , the assault on the police training school in Ratta Kulachi on Friday involved heavy weapons and lasted nearly six hours.Around 200 recruits and trainers were inside during the attack, and officers returned fire, preventing mass casualties. Six militants were killed in the operation, along with the seizure of suicide vests, explosives, and weapons.Security forces have faced rising threats this year, with over 500 people, including 311 troops and 73 police officers, killed in militant attacks from January to mid-September, according to AFP.The TTP, though allied with the Afghan Taliban, operates independently and remains a major threat along Pakistan’s northwestern border.","The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for a series of deadly attacks across northwestern districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

LAHORE: Violent clashes erupted Friday between police and Islamists in Pakistan 's eastern city of Lahore after security forces tried to stop thousands of demonstrators from leaving for the capital, Islamabad, where they planned to stage a pro-Palestinian rally outside the US Embassy, officials said.The clashes in the capital of Punjab province began Thursday but intensified Friday after police baton-charged the demonstrators and fired tear gas to disperse them at multiple locations. Protesters hurled stones at officers in response.In a statement, the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan party, or TLP, claimed that two of its supporters had been killed and 50 others injured since Thursday. There was no immediate comment from the Punjab provincial government, which is headed by Punjab chief minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif, the niece of the prime minister.The protest comes after Hamas and Israel agreed to a ceasefire plan brokered by US President Donald Trump.Speaking to thousands of worshippers in Lahore at Friday prayers, TLP chief Saad Rizvi announced the march, saying, ""We will now march from Lahore to the US Embassy"" in Islamabad.He said: ""I will walk at the head of the long march. Arrest is not a problem, bullets are not a problem, shells are not a problem - martyrdom is our destiny.""Police officers were swinging batons and firing tear gas to disperse demonstrators near the main TLP office, according to witnesses, who said residents also faced severe difficulties because of the tear gas.The violence has disrupted daily life in parts of Lahore, as residents struggled to reach home because of road closures and continued clashes.On Friday, authorities shut schools, colleges and universities in Lahore, a city of more than 14 million people.The government of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has suspended mobile internet service in Islamabad and nearby Rawalpindi as part of measures aimed at preventing demonstrators from reaching the national capital.Authorities have also placed shipping containers along the main motorway, the main highways and roads leading to Islamabad to block protesters.Lahore is about 350 kilometers (210 miles) from Islamabad.The U.S. Embassy in Islamabad issued a security alert ahead of the march, warning of possible disruptions and urging American citizens to exercise caution.""Large crowds and traffic congestion are expected, along with a precautionary security presence, an increased number of checkpoints, and associated disruptions to local mobile and internet networks in the region,"" the embassy said, adding that the duration of the protests is unknown.It advised U.S. citizens to avoid large gatherings, remain aware of their surroundings and keep a low profile.Deputy Interior Minister Talal Chaudhry said Thursday that the TLP had not submitted a request for permission to hold the rally. The group denied the claim, saying it had applied for permission for a peaceful march to express solidarity with Palestinians.The TLP, known for staging disruptive and sometimes violent protests, has drawn criticism online. But many users have accused the government of overreacting by blocking roads even before the demonstrators began their march.""Why are these demonstrators coming to Islamabad for the rally when the peace process has already started in Palestine?"" asked Mohammad Ashfaq, 35, as he turned back from a road block in Islamabad.He said he tried using longer routes to reach the city, but police had also blocked those roads with shipping containers.

Why the defeat hurts Pakistan



How Trump’s self-promotion cost him







Opposition leader María Corina Machado of Venezuela has been awarded the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize , beating a crowded field of nominees that included US President Donald Trump , whose campaign for the honour had drawn international attention. The Nobel Committee said it was honouring Machado “for her tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of Venezuela and for her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy. ”The decision dealt a personal blow to Trump, who had publicly lobbied for the award, calling himself the “president of peace” and repeatedly claiming to have “ended six or seven wars.” But it is also a diplomatic setback for Pakistan , one of the countries that had formally nominated Trump for the prize, portraying him as a “champion of peace.”Pakistan had gone all in on Trump this year. Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif and Field Marshall Asim Munir made a visit to the White House in August, where they met Trump in a rare Oval Office engagement. Islamabad hailed the meeting as a breakthrough moment in US-Pakistan ties, saying the two sides had discussed cooperation on counter-terrorism, regional security, and new economic ventures. This was Munir’s third trip to the oval office just this year alone.Sharif, speaking later at the United Nations, described Trump as “a champion of peace” and said nominating him for the Nobel Peace Prize was “the least we could do.” Pakistan’s nomination cited Trump’s claimed role in “de-escalating” tensions between India and Pakistan, a claim New Delhi has consistently rejected.In recent months, the Trump administration has pushed to deepen economic ties with Islamabad even as trade talks with India remain stalled. The US government announced its intent to collaborate with Pakistan on critical minerals and hydrocarbons, while Trump himself unveiled a plan to help Pakistan develop its “massive oil reserves.”On his Truth Social platform, Trump said, “We have finalised a deal with Pakistan, where both countries will collaborate on developing Pakistan’s extensive oil reserves… Perhaps, in the future, they might sell oil to India!”The boast turned out to be wildly optimistic. According to energy data, Pakistan has just 0.02% of the world’s crude oil reserves, less than a tenth of India’s production. Yet Islamabad’s enthusiasm for Trump reflected both economic desperation and the hope of finding a patron in Washington amid regional isolation.For Islamabad, Trump’s loss is more than symbolic. Pakistan’s government had staked diplomatic capital on its public embrace of the US president, even as India-Pakistan tensions simmered. By nominating Trump and describing him as a “friend of peace,” Sharif’s administration had hoped to reset relations with Washington, a move seen as a pivot away from Beijing.Instead, Pakistan now faces embarrassment on two fronts: Trump’s failure to win the Nobel Prize and the exposure of Islamabad’s overreach. The White House never released an official readout of the Trump–Sharif–Munir meeting, and Washington’s silence contrasted sharply with Islamabad’s exuberant press releases and photos of a smiling Trump flashing his signature thumbs-up.The loss also weakens Pakistan’s argument that Trump’s mediation ended the brief but intense India–Pakistan conflict earlier this year, a claim denied by India’s military, which maintains that the ceasefire was negotiated directly between the two countries’ commanders.For now, the Nobel Peace Prize has gone to a woman fighting for democracy in Venezuela. But for Donald Trump and his unlikely backers in Islamabad the snub serves as a reminder that peace cannot be won through press releases or self-congratulation. It must be earned.For Trump, the Nobel campaign was intensely personal. Over the past year, he has repeatedly told reporters that he “should have gotten [the prize] four or five times” and that “everyone says” he deserves it. He even reminded UN delegates in September that his “peace record” was unmatched, claiming to have ended wars between Israel and Iran, India and Pakistan, and “even Thailand and Cambodia.”But this relentless self-promotion likely backfired. Members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee have long avoided appearing to reward leaders who lobby openly for recognition. “We base our decision only on the work and the will of Alfred Nobel,” Committee Chair Jørgen Watne Frydnes said, adding that lobbying or political pressure had “no bearing” on their choice.Moreover, Trump’s record remains divisive. While he claims credit for brokering ceasefires, critics point out that many conflicts he boasts of ending were never formally resolved, and others, such as the war in Ukraine, continue to rage. His domestic policies including mass deportations, expanded war powers, and withdrawal from global climate pacts have also undercut his image as a peacemaker.As one expert told the Associated Press, the Nobel Committee prefers to honour the “durability of peace and the quiet work of institutions”, not the “rhetoric of power.”","María Corina Machado of Venezuela has been awarded the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize.

Hamas-style Ambush Stuns Pak: 12 Soldiers FALL Into Pakistani Taliban Trap, Drones Captured | Watch





A deadly ambush by Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) fighters near the Afghan border in the early hours of Wednesday claimed the lives of at least 11 Pakistani soldiers, including two senior officers - Maj Tayyab Rahat and Lt Col Junaid Arif.The attack was reported from the Kurram district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) province. TTP fighters launched heavy gunfire at a military post, catching Pak military personnel by surprise. The TTP also suffered casualties in the fierce gunbattle, which lasted for a few hours, though the exact number remains unclear, sources said.The latest attack comes amid rising tensions, with the TTP retaliating against the Pakistani military's support for terror groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), which have gained ground in KPK of late. The ideological divide between the groups - the TTP adheres to Deobandi ideology and is anti-Pakistan, whereas groups like LeT follow the Ahle Hadith ideology and are pro-Pakistan -- is only fuelling the violence.Despite Pakistan's long-standing support for the Taliban, a militant group trained in Deobandi madrasas and instrumental in the fight against Russian and American forces, as well as local ethnic groups like the Tajiks, the TTP has defied Islamabad's expectations by asserting its autonomy.This independence poses a potential challenge for Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency, particularly in its plans to establish a new base for LeT in KPK, a region considered a Taliban stronghold.The TTP has turned vocal against Pak government's directly facilitating the relocation of terror groups from POK to Khyber regions. The situation turned tense when Pakistani military launched a ""clean-up drive"" in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to neutralise TTP cadres in Lower Dir district, a move aimed at smoothening LeT operations. The drive, launched in June, has not only resulted in the death of over two dozen TTP operatives but also allowed the LeT to start constructing its new terror centre within a month of the operation.","The attack was reported from the Kurram district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) province.

The Bangladesh Army on Saturday announced that it has taken into custody 15 serving officers over the alleged cases of enforced disappearances during the tenure of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina , who stepped down following student-led protests in August 2024.The army’s action comes three days after Bangladesh’s International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) issued warrants for 25 military officers, AFP reported.

They are detached from their families and are being held in high-security detention with guards and other necessary arrangements,” Major General Md Hakimuzzaman, the army’s adjutant general, told reporters at the military headquarters in Dhaka.The remaining 10 include nine retired officers and one who is on leave pending retirement, the senior army official added.Hakimuzzaman acknowledged that the arrests would impact troop morale ahead of the general elections, likely to be held in February 2026.“I can’t deny that the arrest warrants against military officers are affecting us, but we will remain steadfast in ensuring justice,” he remarked.The country’s interim government, led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus and which took charge days after Hasina’s ouster, formed the commission to investigate the disappearance cases.It has so far received around 1,700 complaints.The accused officers are expected to appear before the ICT on October 22.This marks the first time such a large number of senior-ranking serving and retired security officials are likely to face civilian trials in Bangladesh.India’s eastern neighbour witnessed large-scale student-led protests that began in July last year against government job quotas.

A powerful offshore earthquake , preliminarily measured at magnitude 7.6, struck off the southern Philippine province of Davao Oriental on Friday morning, killing two people.Social media has been flooded with videos showing the quake’s immediate impact. In one clip, chaos erupts at Tagum City Davao Hospital, with staff and patients rushing out of the building as tremors shake the structure.Another video shows an office or building interior where files and boxes topple from tables, tubelights sway dangerously, and lights flicker out. Employees are seen ducking under desks, trying to protect themselves from falling debris.On the streets, some residents are forced to get down on their hands and knees to maintain their balance as the ground shakes beneath them, highlighting the intensity of the tremor.Authorities have warned of possible aftershocks and a hazardous tsunami in nearby coastal areas, urging residents to follow evacuation protocols and stay tuned to official updates as the situation develops.The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology said it was expecting damage and aftershocks from an earthquake centred at sea approximately 62 kilometres (38 miles) southeast of Manay town in Davao Oriental province.The quake was caused by movement along a fault at a shallow depth of 10 kilometres (6 miles). The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Honolulu said hazardous waves were possible within 300 kilometres (186 miles) of the epicentre.It said waves up to 3 metres (10 feet) above normal tides were possible on some Philippine coasts, and smaller waves were possible in Indonesia and Palau. Office of Civil Defense deputy administrator Bernardo Rafaelito Alejandro IV warned that tsunami waves could hit six nearby coastal provinces from Davao Oriental up to two hours after the earthquake struck at 9.43 am He asked people to immediately move to higher ground or further inland away from coastal areas. “We urge these coastal communities to be on alert and immediately evacuate to higher grounds until further notice,” Alejandro said in a video news briefing.“Owners of boats in harbours and those in the coastal areas...should secure their boats and move away from the waterfronts,” he said. The Philippines is still recovering from a Sept. 30 earthquake with a magnitude of 6.9 that left at least 74 people dead and displaced thousands of people in the central province of Cebu, particularly Bogo city and outlying towns.One of the world’s most disaster-prone countries, the Philippines is often hit by earthquakes and volcanic eruptions because of its location on the Pacific Ring of Fire, an arc of seismic faults around the ocean.

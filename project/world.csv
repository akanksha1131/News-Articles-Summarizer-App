One bill or two? Trump and GOP debate legislative path for sweeping reforms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/one-bill-or-two-trump-and-gop-debate-legislative-path-for-sweeping-reforms/articleshow/117068973.cms,"AP photo

US President-elect Donald Trump visited Capitol Hill on Wednesday for a closed-door meeting with Republican senators, as party leaders strategise on advancing his agenda ahead of his upcoming inauguration.Republicans are gearing up to reduce taxes, cut spending, and curb immigration, with a wide-ranging agenda that will need the party to come together on numerous complex policy decisions.The GOP is divided over whether to pass his proposals in one comprehensive bill or split them into two.""I like one big beautiful bill, I always have and always will, but if two is more certain, it does go a little bit quicker because you can do the immigration stuff early,"" Trump said, as quoted by the New York Times on Tuesday.House Republicans favour a single bill that encompasses tax cuts, border security, and energy initiatives. In contrast, Senate Republicans, led by Senator John Thune, are considering splitting the plan into two packages. Thune’s strategy would push for border security and energy provisions in the first bill, with tax cuts to follow in the second.One tool Republicans are eyeing is budget reconciliation, a complicated process that allows legislation to pass with a simple majority, bypassing potential filibusters in the Senate.As Trump meets with Republican lawmakers, both in Washington and at his Mar-a-Lago estate, the party is working to unite around a plan that will give them the momentum they need in the upcoming term.Trump's return to the Capitol is a significant moment, especially after the January 6 riot four years ago, which saw his supporters storm the Capitol.","US President-elect Donald Trump visited Capitol Hill on Wednesday for a closed- door meeting with Republican senators.

Marine Le Pen: French far-right leader Marine Le Pen pays tribute to her politically polarising father,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/french-far-right-leader-marine-le-pen-pays-tribute-to-her-politically-polarising-father/articleshow/117069532.cms,"French far-right leader Marine Le Pen pays tribute to her politically polarising father (Picture credit: AP)

PARIS: French far-right leader Marine Le Pen paid tribute Wednesday to her father Jean-Marie, calling the founder of the National Front , who has died aged 96, a ""warrior"" in politics as their relationship was marked by notoriously harsh disputes amid her efforts to make the party more mainstream.In a post on social media platform X, Le Pen wrote: ""A venerable age had taken the warrior away but given us back our father,"" suggesting she was able to reconcile with him.Jean-Marie, who has three daughters, including Marine, the youngest, was a polarizing figure, convicted multiple times of antisemitism, discrimination and inciting racial violence.""Many people he loved are waiting for him up there. Many who love him mourn him here below,"" Le Pen wrote. ""Fair winds and following seas, Papa!""Jean-Marie Le Pen 's death was announced on Tuesday when his daughter was on her way back from the French territory of Mayotte, in the Indian Ocean, which was hit by a devastating cyclone in December.Marine Le Pen's legal issues Marine Le Pen is widely considered as one of France's top contenders for the next presidential election scheduled in 2027. She was runner-up to President Emmanuel Macron twice in previous elections.Yet her political future in part depends on the verdict to be rendered by a Paris court on March 31 over charges of embezzlement of European Parliament Funds. The court could declare her ineligible to seek public office if she was to be found guilty.Le Pen and other party officials are accused of having used money intended for European Union parliamentary aides to pay instead staff who worked for the party between 2004 and 2016, violating the 27-nation bloc's regulations.Anti-far right gatherings Thousands of demonstrators gathered on the Republic Plaza in Paris on Tuesday evening to celebrate the death of the far-right politician. The crowd could be seen dancing and chanting: ""Happy New Year, Jean-Marie is dead.""Similar gatherings took place in other French cities, including Lyon and Marseille.French anti-racist group SOS Racisme said Jean-Marie Le Pen spent his life promoting the far right through ""racism, xenophobia, antisemitism and Holocaust denial."" The group also paid tribute in a statement to ""generations of activists who have given their time, youth and energy to fight the National Front and its ideas.""Father-daughter public disputes In an interview in 1987, Jean-Marie referred to the Nazi gas chambers as a ""detail in World War II history.""He repeated the remark in 2015, saying he ""did not at all"" regret it, triggering the ire of his daughter, by then the party leader, seeking to distance herself from her father's extremist image. That year, he was kicked out of the party, later renamed the National Rally, as part of the younger Le Pen's efforts to transform it into one of France's most powerful political forces.At the time, Jean-Marie publicly denounced a ""felony"" and asked his daughter to ""give back her name,"" arguing she should not use ""Le Pen"" anymore. He also launched legal proceedings to challenge his exclusion that ultimately failed.""I had such profound disagreements on that topic with my own father that I had to exclude him from the movement,"" Marine Le Pen told BFM television in May 2024. ""It was complicated for me emotionally, but I did it.""Jean-Marie Le Pen's funeral will take place on Saturday in his birth town of La Trinite-sur-Mer , in the western Brittany region.","French far-right leader Marine Le Pen pays tribute to her politically polarising father.

'The joke is over': Canadian finance minister says Trump's '51st US state' remarks no longer funny,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/the-joke-is-over-canadian-finance-minister-says-trumps-51st-us-state-remarks-no-longer-funny/articleshow/117068893.cms,"Dominic LeBlanc and Donald Trump

'He should focus on his own issues'

'A South Park episode'

'I don’t know who is misinforming him'

'We are not going to be annexed'

Canadian finance minister Dominic LeBlanc on Wednesday said that US President-elect Donald Trump ’s remarks about Canada becoming the 51st US state are no longer a ""joke.""“The joke is over,” LeBlanc said. “It’s a way for him, I think, to sow confusion, to agitate people, to create chaos knowing this will never happen.”LeBlanc’s comments come as Prime Minister Trudeau announced his resignation, adding another layer of complexity to US-Canada relations. Trudeau will remain in office until a new Liberal leader is chosen.Trump had initially suggested that Canada should become the 51st US state during a dinner with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau . He has also proposed using “economic force” to pressure Canada, citing what he describes as a US trade deficit with the country.LeBlanc called Trump’s rhetoric “counterproductive” and said he is in contact with the incoming US administration about border security to avoid potential tariffs.Apart from LeBlanc, many Canadian officials have reacted strongly to Trump’s repeated comments suggesting Canada should become the 51st US state.“The timing is awful for sure,” said Canadian Liberal lawmaker Judy Sgro, referring to the leadership change. “But we will do what we have to do to ensure that Canada stands strong.”Sgro also addressed Trump directly: “He should focus on his own issues in his own country, because he’s got lots of them.”Immigration minister Marc Miller called Trump’s remarks “ridiculous.” “There is no chance of us becoming the 51st state. I think that this is beneath a president of the United States,” Miller said. “I said a few weeks ago that this whole thing was like a South Park episode.”Trump has also claimed the US does not need Canadian imports like automobiles, lumber, and dairy. Ontario Premier Doug Ford disputed this, stressing Canada’s significant oil exports to the US.“I don’t know who is misinforming him. Right now we ship 4.3 million barrels of crude oil into the US. Sixty percent of their energy imports are coming from Canada.”Ford warned of retaliation if tariffs are imposed.Canadian foreign minister Mélanie Joly said that while she takes Trump’s threats seriously, “At the same time we can’t take the bait. We have to show we have a strong economy and we are strong and we are not going to be annexed.”Canada is a major supplier of steel, aluminum, and uranium to the US, as well as a key source of critical minerals. Billions of dollars in goods and services cross the US-Canada border daily. Beyond his comments on Canada becoming the 51st US state, Trump has also talked about acquiring Greenland and the Panama Canal.","Canadian finance minister Dominic LeBlanc said that US President-elect Donald Trump’s remarks about Canada becoming the 51st US state are no longer a ""joke"" Trump has proposed using “economic force” to pressure Canada, citing what he describes as a US trade deficit.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117069404,imgsize-728104,width-400,resizemode-4/117069404.jpg"

A state of emergency was declared by California governor Gavin Newsom as wildfires raged across Los Angeles.The towering blazes ignited on Tuesday and were driven by winds gusting up to 70 mph (112 kph) in certain areas, creating an inferno that firefighters struggled to contain. For a time, the winds rendered aerial firefighting efforts too dangerous. By Wednesday morning, however, firefighting aircraft resumed operations, dropping water and retardants over the flames.Governor Gavin Newsom reported that more than 1,400 firefighters have been deployed to combat the fires, with additional support coming from Oregon, which has dispatched 240 firefighters and 60 engines. The Los Angeles Fire Department issued an extraordinary call for all off-duty personnel to join the fight.Preliminary estimates by AccuWeather place the damage and economic losses from these fires between $52 billion and $57 billion. The destruction is concentrated in Pacific Palisades, where at least 1,000 structures have been decimated, making the Palisades Fire the most destructive in Los Angeles history. It surpasses the Sayre Fire of November 2008, which destroyed 604 structures in Sylmar.Social media has been flooded with heart-wrenching videos capturing the fire’s wrath. Harrowing footage shows flames consuming entire neighborhoods and forcing mass evacuations.Videos also document firefighting planes scooping water from the Pacific Ocean and releasing it over residential areas in a desperate effort to battle the infernos.The fire’s proximity to iconic landmarks, including the Hollywood Sign, has heightened public alarm, with some residents reporting flames visible from across Los Angeles.The devastation has prompted an outpouring of support, with neighboring states and local organizations stepping in to aid rescue operations.

Ford’s fiery history of defiance

Trudeau’s take: A snowball’s chance in hell

Trump’s grand vision

Ontario Premier Doug Ford has never been one to shy away from a confrontation, but his latest sparring match with former US President Donald Trump has taken the Canada-US dynamic into uncharted territory. At a press conference on Monday, Ford fired back at Trump’s provocative suggestion that Canada should become the 51st state, offering a counterproposal that caught everyone off guard.“To the president, I’ll make him a counteroffer,” Ford said, visibly irritated by the question. “How about if we buy Alaska? And we’ll throw in Minnesota and Minneapolis at the same time? You know, it’s not realistic.”Ford’s remarks were in response to Trump’s renewed push for unification with Canada, which the former president claimed would benefit both nations economically and militarily. Ford, however, was having none of it.“He may be joking, but under my watch, that will never, ever happen,” Ford declared, emphasizing his commitment to protecting Canadian sovereignty .This isn’t the first time Ford has locked horns with Trump. In 2024, the Ontario Premier threatened to cut off electricity exports to over a million Americans and ban American-made beer in retaliation for Trump’s proposed 25% tariffs on Canadian goods.“If they come at us, we have to stand up for Canadians,” Ford said at the time. “It would cut off the lights to a million-and-a-half Americans.”Canada is the largest exporter of energy to the US, with states like Michigan and New York heavily reliant on Ontario’s electricity. Ford’s bold threats underscored the delicate interdependence between the two nations.Outgoing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also weighed in on Trump’s 51st state proposal. In a fiery post on X (formerly Twitter), Trudeau dismissed the idea outright:“There isn’t a snowball’s chance in hell that Canada would become part of the United States,” he wrote. “Workers and communities in both our countries benefit from being each other’s biggest trading and security partner.”Trudeau’s rebuttal came as Trump ramped up his rhetoric on Truth Social, claiming that many Canadians “LOVE being the 51st state” and that merging the two nations would eliminate tariffs and bolster security against Russia and China.Trump’s ambitions don’t stop at Canada. The president-elect has also revived his interest in purchasing Greenland, a move he first floated during his previous term. On Monday, he posted a meme on Truth Social showing a map of North America with both Canada and Greenland covered in the American flag, captioned “Oh, Canada!”“We will protect it, and cherish it, from a very vicious outside World. MAKE GREENLAND GREAT AGAIN!” Trump proclaimed, while his son, Donald Trump Jr., toured Greenland wearing a MAGA hat.","Ontario Premier Doug Ford has never been one to shy away from a confrontation, but his latest sparring match with former US President Donald Trump has taken the Canada-US dynamic into uncharted territory.

In a war of words, Elon Musk took a swipe at Justin Trudeau on Wednesday, belittling the Canadian Prime Minister by calling him a “girl” and dismissing his authority with the jab, “You’re not the governor of Canada anymore.” This came after Trudeau publicly rejected Donald Trump’s provocative suggestion that the United States could take over Canada.Trudeau, who announced his resignation as Prime Minister earlier this week amid plummeting popularity, fiercely rebuffed Trump’s idea. “There isn’t a snowball’s chance in hell that Canada would become part of the United States,” Trudeau declared in a fiery post on X (formerly Twitter), emphasizing the mutual benefits of Canada-US trade and security partnerships.Musk, never one to hold back, mocked Trudeau’s statement. “Girl, you’re not the governor of Canada anymore, so doesn’t matter what you say,” the Tesla CEO retorted, triggering an avalanche of reactions on social media.Meanwhile, Trump doubled down on his controversial remarks, saying at Mar-a-Lago that Canada joining the US would be “something really special.” The President-elect dismissed the idea of military force, saying, “No, economic force,” while hinting at a 25% tariff on Canadian imports as leverage. Trump has repeatedly called the Canada-US border an “artificially drawn line” and referred to Trudeau as the “governor of Canada.”Adding fuel to the fire, Musk praised the dramatic political shifts of 2025 in another X post, celebrating what he called the return of “great men.” Highlighting Trudeau’s resignation, he wrote, “Trump won. Trudeau resigned. Masculinity is back. Great men are ascendant. And just in time. We’re going to need them.”Trudeau’s decision to step down follows growing dissent within his own Liberal Party amid a struggling economy and bleak approval ratings. With Canada’s next federal election looming by October 20, polls predict a landslide victory for the Conservatives, signaling a seismic political shift in the Great White North.","Elon Musk took a swipe at Justin Trudeau on Wednesday, belittling the Canadian Prime Minister.

Musk’s support: A call for justice

In a fiery exchange that dominated the first PMQs of 2025, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch took aim at Prime Minister Keir Starmer over his refusal to launch a national inquiry into the grooming gangs scandal . The showdown saw Badenoch accusing Starmer of brushing aside the issue of accountability, as she called for a fresh investigation into the systematic abuse, supported by an unexpected ally—Elon Musk.Badenoch opened her line of questioning with a scathing remark about the ""decades-long rape gangs scandal"" that continues to haunt communities across the UK. “There are thousands of victims, but no one has joined the dots or has the total picture. It is almost certainly still going on,” she said, demanding answers from the PM about whether the ""full extent"" of the gangs’ activity had been uncovered.Starmer, however, took a defensive stance, citing numerous local and national inquiries that have already been conducted. He stressed the need for action based on the information already gathered, rather than prolonging investigations further. “What is needed now is action on what we already know,” Starmer said. But Badenoch wasn’t backing down.“The problem,” she shot back, “is that these previous inquiries have not held anyone accountable in a meaningful way. One victim from Telford said she wants a national inquiry because it will hold people accountable in a way that previous inquiries have not.” Her words rang with urgency, a demand for justice that could no longer be ignored.Badenoch’s challenge became more pointed as she pressed Starmer: “The PM called for nine inquiries in the last Parliament. Does he not see that by resisting this one, people will start to worry about a cover-up?” Starmer, unfazed, accused Badenoch of “jumping on the bandwagon,” claiming she had never raised the issue when she was in power as children’s minister and women’s equalities minister.Badenoch responded sharply, declaring, “Be a leader, not a lawyer.” She reminded Starmer that the focus must be on the victims, not political maneuvering. “This is not about you, Starmer, or your past work with the Crown Prosecution Service. It’s about the victims, the children who have suffered in silence.”At one point, Starmer attempted to deflect, stating that another lengthy inquiry would delay justice until 2031, but Badenoch was having none of it. “Shorter inquiries are possible. We don’t need to repeat what has already been done,” she argued, emphasizing that the national inquiry should address the racial and cultural motivations behind the abuse, which has often been downplayed.The two leaders clashed once more over past government actions, with Badenoch calling out Starmer’s dismissal of the Conservatives’ work. “He knows full well we accepted 18 of the 20 recommendations in the Jay Inquiry and went further, launching a gangs taskforce,” she retorted. Despite this, Starmer accused the Tories of failing to act on those very recommendations, insisting his party had been “acting” while the Conservatives merely “tweeted and talked.”The tension reached a boiling point when Badenoch demanded: “How are MPs going to explain to their constituents that obeying the whip is more important than doing the right thing?” Starmer, stung by her words, snapped back, accusing the Tories of “bandwagon-jumping” and labeling their approach “misguided” and “short-sighted.”Amidst the back-and-forth, an unlikely figure weighed in on the debate. Elon Musk, the billionaire tech mogul and owner of X, backed Badenoch’s call for action, using his platform to draw attention to the scandal. “Please call your member of parliament and tell them that the hundreds of thousands of little girls in Britain who were, and are still being systematically, horrifically gang-raped deserve some justice in this world,” Musk wrote in a post that quickly gained traction.“This is vitally important, or it will just keep happening,” Musk added, aligning himself with Badenoch’s stance and bolstering her demand for a national inquiry.","Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch took aim at Prime Minister Keir Starmer over his refusal to launch a national inquiry into the grooming gangs scandal.

At least five people have lost their lives, and thousands have been displaced as wildfires in Los Angeles continue to rage. Additionally, more than 1,000 buildings, including homes, businesses, and landmarks, were destroyed.According to a report by the Associated Press, the fires burned through affluent neighbourhoods such as Pacific Palisades and Calabasas, home to celebrities and multimillion-dollar homes. Entire blocks were levelled, with luxury cars reduced to husks and swimming pools filled with ash. Palisades Village lost major grocery stores, banks, and even a library.The flames spread so rapidly that many people had little time to escape. Police officers took refuge in their patrol cars, while residents of a senior living centre were hurried to safety in wheelchairs and hospital beds, navigating the streets in the foothills northeast of Los Angeles.Hollywood productions have also come to a halt, and landmarks such as the Getty Villa faced significant threats from the advancing flames.The fires, which have consumed over 42 square miles, are among the most destructive in Los Angeles’ history. Pacific Palisades was hit hardest, surpassing the damage caused by the 2008 Sayre fire. Winds reaching 80 mph worsened conditions, briefly grounding firefighting aircraft.California Governor Gavin Newsom deployed over 1,400 firefighters and National Guard troops to combat the wildfires, while President Joe Biden has pledged federal aid to support the response efforts.With climate change fuelling longer fire seasons and stronger winds, officials warned the danger is far from over. Dry winds, including the notorious Santa Anas, have contributed to warmer-than-average temperatures in Southern California, which has not seen more than 0.1 inches (0.25 centimeters) of rain since early May.","The fires, which have consumed over 42 square miles, are among the most destructive in Los Angeles’ history.

WASHINGTON: The medical license of an Indian American physician has been permanently revoked for illegally recruiting and harbouring two Indian women to be household servants for low pay. Dr Harsha Sahni , who maintained a rheumatology practice in Colonia, New Jersey, pleaded guilty to federal charges of conspiracy to conceal and harbour aliens and filing a false tax return last February.She is scheduled to begin serving a 27-month prison sentence handed down by a federal court judge in October 2024, attorney general Matthew J Platkin and the division of consumer affairs announced on Wednesday.Sahni had been temporarily suspended from the practice of medicine since September 2023, as the State pursued an administrative action to revoke her license in the wake of her criminal plea.""The revocation announced today brings closure to a disturbing case in which a physician sworn to uphold the highest standards of care and compassion exploited and abused vulnerable victims for her own financial gain,"" attorney general Platkin said.""There is no place in the medical profession for this kind of criminal conduct and utter disregard for humanity.""""Dr Sahni's treatment of the women she illegally harboured as cheap labour for her and her family violated the most basic rules of the medical profession and caused her victims unimaginable suffering,"" said Cari Fais, director of the division of consumer affairs.""Only the permanent revocation of her medical license could adequately protect New Jersey and its residents from the dangers she posed as a practising physician,"" Fais said.Sahni had pleaded guilty to the charges last February.

President-elect Donald Trump’s upcoming inauguration has sparked unprecedented demand from donors, leaving some seven-figure donors without VIP access to key events due to limited capacity.According to a New York Times report, the inaugural committee has raised more than $170 million so far, a record-breaking figure that surpasses his 2017 inauguration haul of $107 million.Private events such as the exclusive ""candlelight dinner"" on January 19, featuring Trump and his wife Melania, have become highly sought after, with some donors offering as much as $1 million despite receiving no guarantees of access. The dinner is considered the highlight of a series of events beginning on January 17.Corporate America and wealthy individuals have shown a growing eagerness to align with Trump’s administration. Trump had also recently said after being elected that he is being embraced by business executives, a sharp contrast to his first presidential win eight years ago.""In the first term, everybody was fighting. In this term, everybody wants to be my friend,"" he had said.“Space is limited,” read marketing materials sent to prospective contributors, with the committee halting ticket sales earlier than expected due to extraordinary demand.Free public tickets for the January 20 swearing-in ceremony remain available through members of Congres. However, the rush for VIP packages underscores the desire for exclusive access among the wealthy and well-connected.Funds raised are expected to approach $200 million, with leftover money likely allocated to a Trump presidential library fund.Trump's allies have already raised over $250 million since Election Day for political projects.","The inaugural committee has raised more than $170 million so far, a record- breaking figure that surpasses his 2017 inauguration haul of $107 million.

THIS IS WHAT JOE BIDEN IS LEAVING ME. THANKS JOE!”The situation in California has grown dire, with firefighters facing severe water shortages as wildfires continue to rage across the state. Across Pacific Palisades and other areas, fire hydrants have run dry, leaving emergency responders unable to access enough water to contain the flames. In many places, water supplies have dwindled, and pressure in hoses has dropped, leaving firefighters desperate for resources.The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), a key US government agency responsible for disaster response and recovery, has reportedly been left without adequate funds to prepare for future crises, leaving California ill-prepared to handle the current wildfire situation.

It’s burning at levels even worse than last night. This is not government.

ISLAMABAD, Pakistan's finance minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Tuesday announced that the federal government has decided to cut the number of affiliated agencies by half, abolishing 1,50,000 jobs, as part of a sweeping cost-cutting and efficiency drive.""We are reducing the federal government's size step by step. So far, 80 departments have been consolidated into 40,"" Aurangzeb said at a press conference where he highlighted the government's goal to complete these reforms by June 2025.He added that 60% of vacant positions have been abolished, which comes to 150,000 government jobs.He said that right-sizing was part of the restructuring initiative launched in mid-2024 by a committee formed under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to rationalise expenditures and improve performance.According to the minister, the committee was to look into 43 ministries and their subordinate agencies. He said that the federal government's annual expenditure on these departments was Rs900 billion.He said that the six ministries that the government had initially selected for right-sizing included Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan, States and Frontier Regions (SAFRON), IT and Telecom, Industries and Reproduction, National Health Services and Capital Development Authority (CAD).He said that the Ministry of Kashmir Affairs, Gilgit-Baltistan and SAFRON are being merged and CAD is being abolished.According to the minister, in the second phase, out of the 60 subordinate institutions of the Ministry of Science and Technology, Commerce Division, Housing and Works, and National Food Security Research, 25 institutions will be abolished, 20 will be reduced in size and nine will be merged.""We took four ministries in the second phase and after that, we have now taken five more ministries,"" he said, adding that those selected for the third phase were ministries of federal education and professional training, information and broadcasting, power division, finance division, and national heritage and culture.He said that work had been done over the past several years to reduce the size of the federal government, but ""the problem was that if you wanted to do everything possible at once, it couldn't be done, so we decided to do it gradually, in stages.""The minister said the federal government also plans to transfer hospitals to provincial administrations. ""This is not just about cutting costs; it's about improving efficiency,"" he said.Aurangzeb also said that the plan was to shift Pakistan's economic framework towards export-driven growth, supported by digitalisation and technology initiatives and the prime minister is expected to inaugurate a new technology-related program in Karachi soon.He said that the government's focus on macroeconomic stability helped the key indicators to improve and Pakistan was standing at a promising economic juncture due to various government efforts.The size of the Pakistani government came into the crosshairs after the sharp increase in expenditures and questions were being raised over it.The current government has been taking steps and reducing the size and expenses. It abolished the traditional pension system for government employees last year and reduced the pension benefits for the current employees.","Pakistan's finance minister Muhammad Aurangzeb announced that the federal government has decided to cut the number of affiliated agencies by half. 60% of vacant positions have been abolished, which comes to 150,000 government jobs.

What is the case?

'Imran Khan broke all records'

A Pakistani court has postponed the verdict announcement in GBP 190 million Al-Qadir Trust corruption case against former Prime Minister Imran Khan. The verdict is now scheduled for January 13, according to Islamabad accountability court staff.The delay was attributed to Judge Nasir Javed Rana's leave, the court staff said. Both the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) prosecutor and the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder's lawyers have been informed about the postponement. This marks the second delay in the case. The verdict, initially reserved on December 18, was first scheduled for December 23The case alleges that Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, received land and billions of rupees from Bahria Town. In exchange, they allegedly legalized £190 million returned to Pakistan by the UK during Khan's tenure in office.In December 2023, the NAB filed a corruption reference against the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder, Bushra Bibi, and several others. The investigation focused on the alleged acquisition of hundreds of acres of land for the Al-Qadir University Trust, which reportedly caused a GBP 190 million loss to the national treasury.The charges state that Imran Khan and other accused individuals misappropriated PKR 50 billion (equivalent to GBP 190 million at the time), transferred by the UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) to the Pakistani government, ARY News reported.As part of the investigation, NAB filed a corruption reference against Imran Khan, Bushra Bibi, and six others in connection with the Al-Qadir University project, which was initially registered on December 26, 2019.Pakistan defence minister Khawaja Asif recently reiterated the corruption allegations against Khan in this case. “There has been a lot of corruption in the last 75 years, but Imran Khan broke all records,” Asif said, further alleging that Khan and his associates were heavily involved in corrupt activities.","The verdict is now scheduled for January 13, according to Islamabad accountability court staff.

Does Pakistan minister's comment on Ghazni signal foreign policy shift?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/does-pakistan-ministers-comment-on-ghazni-signal-foreign-policy-shift/articleshow/116973163.cms,"NEW DELHI: Pakistan's old antic to taunt India by naming its missiles after Afghan invaders has taken an unexpected turn in the wake of a new conflict with Afghanistan.The controversy ignited when Pakistan defence minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif described Mahmud of Ghazni - a figure celebrated in Pakistan's historical narrative - as ""merely a plunderer"". His remark, delivered during a televised interview, stunned many in a country where school textbooks have long celebrated Mahmud for his raid on the Somnath temple in India in 1026. This dispute put the spotlight on naming of missiles after figures who invaded India to rile the country.Pakistan has named its missiles after Ghazni who raided and destroyed the legendary Shiv Mandir at Somnath, after Ahmad Shah Abdali who won the third battle of Panipat after defeating the Marathas and massacring thousands of them, and after Muhammad Ghori who defeated Prithviraj Chauhan.The choices of invaders from Afghanistan were deliberately meant to not only rile India but also leave no doubt that Pakistan's ballistic missile programme was India-centric, a narrative that resonated domestically, while deflecting international scrutiny.Asif is a hardliner himself. This time, however, he seemed to target a different audience. His comment came amid escalating tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Pakistan recently conducted airstrikes in Afghanistan, claiming it targeted Pakistani Taliban operatives allegedly harboured by the Afghan Taliban. Analysts suggest Asif's critique of Mahmud was less about historical revisionism and more an attempt to antagonize the Afghan Taliban.The Afghan govt promptly denounced Asif's statements as reckless. Within Pakistan, the remarks sparked a polarizing debate. Some welcomed the re-evaluation of Mahmud's legacy, while others, including members of Asif's own political party, rebuked him. Senator Mushahid Hussain Syed, a former information minister, urged Asif to consult Romila Thapar's work on Somnath. Thapar, a respected Indian historian, posits that Mahmud's attack was motivated by economic and political factors rather than religious zeal, challenging the colonial-era framing of it as a Hindu-Muslim conflict.As the controversy lingers, it raises a provocative question: If Mahmud of Ghazni is no longer regarded as a hero, should the Ghaznavi missile be renamed? This debate transcends mere symbolism, hinting at broader shifts in Pakistan's foreign policy, historical narratives, and regional positioning, amid growing international and domestic pressures.","Defence minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif described Mahmud of Ghazni as ""merely a plunderer"" His comment came amid escalating tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan.

World Bank to approve $20 billion programme for Pakistan: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/world-bank-to-approve-20-billion-programme-for-pakistan-report/articleshow/116966227.cms,"Representative image.

Key focus areas of the framework

Reducing child stunting



Combating learning poverty



Enhancing climate resilience



Decarbonising the environment



Expanding fiscal space



Boosting private investment to improve productivity



Approval from World Bank

Shielding projects from political shifts

Pioneering 10-year partnership

Private sector lending boost

Shifting World Bank strategy

Implementation through rolling business plans

The World Bank is set to approve a $20 billion package for Pakistan, marking the launch of a 10-year initiative to shield development projects from political instability. The programme, "" Pakistan Country Partnership Framework 2025-35 "", will target crucial areas of improvement in Pakistan’s most neglected sectors, with a focus on long-term, stable development, according to reports from Pakistan-based daily newspaper The Express Tribune.The framework will focus on six areas:These priorities have garnered broad support across Pakistan’s political spectrum, making them more likely to remain stable throughout the 2025-2035 period, which is expected to include at least three general elections.The framework is scheduled for approval by the World Bank board on January 14, 2025, following which, the World Bank’s vice president for South Asia, Martin Raiser, is expected to visit Islamabad to discuss the programme’s implementation. This initiative is seen as a long-term solution to protect development projects from Pakistan’s volatile political environment.According to the World Bank’s assessment, this strategy ""will help shield the programme from the country's volatile polity and frequent swings in priorities and requests that follow government changes.""The official documents reveal that past transitions in government have led to the ""fragmentation of the World Bank portfolio and diluted impacts."" A key official, who was part of the framework development, said that the World Bank picked Pakistan as the first country where it would introduce the 10-year partnership strategy.""The World Bank's total indicative lending envelope for fiscal year 2025 to 2035 will total around $ 20 billion,"" as per a draft of the framework quoted by the Express Tribune.Of this, $14 billion will come from the World Bank’s concessional arm, the International Development Association (IDA), while the remaining $6 billion is expected to be provided through the relatively expensive International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD).However, these loans rely on several factors, including the evolution of IDA funding, Pakistan’s performance under the Sustainable Development Finance Policy, and the country’s debt vulnerability indicators.In addition to the $20 billion in loans to the Pakistani government, the framework also aims to facilitate $20 billion in private sector lending through the World Bank’s two other arms: the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). This brings the total value of the World Bank’s engagement in Pakistan to $40 billion. However, the official loans to the government will remain capped at $20 billion.This new lending initiative marks a significant shift in the World Bank’s approach. Rather than focusing on smaller, short-term projects, the framework will concentrate on larger, more impactful investments. It will phase out lending to 10 less impactful sectors like transport, power transmission, telecoms, tertiary healthcare, and higher education, which are seen as less impactful in terms of long-term development.Instead, the World Bank will focus on ""larger projects on average, more frequent scale-ups and expansions, and less pilots and one-off operations"", according to the planning document.The implementation of the 10-year framework will be guided by two-year rolling business plans, which will be agreed upon by both the World Bank and the Pakistani government. By concentrating on long-term, high-impact areas, the World Bank’s new strategy aims to help Pakistan tackle its most pressing socio-economic challenges.","The World Bank is set to approve a $20 billion package for Pakistan, marking the launch of a 10-year initiative to shield development projects from political instability.

Gohar confirmed that all ongoing discussions are solely with the government, Dawn reported.According to Gohar, the PTI leadership initially pursued discussions with the military, acknowledging the army's significant role in decision-making in the country. These contacts were heading in a ""positive direction"" until the arrest of PTI founder Imran Khan in a new case.Gohar detailed that Khan had been granted bail in the Toshakhana case, which involved the controversial purchase of a Bulgari jewellery set, but was soon rearrested on charges related to the September 2024 protest, leading to the collapse of talks with the military.""Now, the PTI is not holding backdoor talks with the establishment,"" Gohar said. However, he emphasised that the possibility of future talks with the military has not been completely closed, leaving room for potential negotiations later. This statement reflects PTI's focus on engaging in dialogue exclusively with the government at this juncture.The PTI chairman also responded to rumours about an alleged offer to move Imran Khan from Adiala Jail to his residence in Banigala. Gohar swiftly dismissed the claims, reiterating that Khan views his detention as illegal. ""There is no point in considering such an offer,"" Gohar stated, aligning with Khan's position on the matter. The PTI leader's refusal to entertain any conditional release further reinforces the party's stance on his unjust incarceration, reported Dawn.Furthermore, Gohar rejected the idea of a trilateral meeting between Imran Khan, PML-N President Nawaz Sharif, and PPP's Asif Ali Zardari, which had been suggested by PML-N leader Rana Sanaullah to resolve the nation's ongoing political crises. He characterised the proposal as ""idealistic,"" citing the irreconcilable differences between the political figures involved.""I might see this day [talks between the three leaders] in my life, but for now, this isn't possible,"" Gohar remarked, indicating that such a dialogue is highly unlikely at the present time.Meanwhile, in Peshawar, PTI's Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqqas Akram addressed the issue of the ongoing talks with the government. He assured that the expected judgment in the £190 million case on January 6 would not derail the negotiations.""The talks will continue, keeping in view the government's seriousness,"" Akram stated, emphasising that the party had not linked the verdict to the discussions. He also spoke about the release of PTI workers who had been sentenced by military courts, clarifying that their freedom had no connection to the ongoing talks with the government.""Our workers were released because they were innocent, and it was not possible to further keep them in jail,"" Akram asserted.The PTI has also been actively engaged in a civil disobedience movement , which began with an appeal to overseas Pakistanis not to send remittances. Akram suggested that the impact of this action would begin to show within two months. He said the PTI would evaluate the situation and consider withdrawing the movement if the government met their demands, such as releasing all imprisoned party members and forming a judicial commission to probe the May 9 and November 26 protests, Dawn reported.""The civil disobedience movement is necessary for a country where the Constitution, laws, and human rights are violated and lawmakers are abducted,"" Akram explained, underscoring the PTI's ongoing commitment to reform. He also criticised the internet disruptions, warning that they would negatively affect Pakistan's digital economy, particularly the youth who contribute significantly to the sector.","Gohar Ali Khan confirms that all ongoing discussions are solely with the government.

The deadly attack had sparked further violence and road closures in the district, restricting access to medicine, food and fuel in the area as casualties in fighting between Sunni and Shia tribes surged to 136.

Under the peace agreement, both sides have agreed on the demolition of bunkers and the handover of heavy weapons to the authorities.“Both sides will give a coordinated plan of action within 15 days for the collection of weapons,” Saif said, adding that bunkers already existing in the area will be dismantled within a month.After the demolition of bunkers, according to the official, any party that launches an attack will be considered a “terrorist” and action will be taken against it.Another provision of the peace agreement states that anybody who violates the terms of the agreement by employing weapons against the other would face a Pakistani Rs 10 million ($35,933) fine. It stated that families displaced by the recent hostilities would be rehabilitated.Shia Muslims dominate parts of Kurram although they are a minority in the rest of Pakistan, which is majority Sunni.

She also suffers from diabetes and cirrhosis of the liver. The Hasina govt had consistently refused requests for Khaleda to travel abroad for treatment after her conviction in a graft case in 2018.

Bangladesh's former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia left for London on Tuesday night for medical treatment .Zia, a political rival of ousted PM Sheikh Hasina , went abroad on a special air ambulance sent by Qatar's emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani.The 79-year-old's personal physician AZM Zahid Hossain told news agency AP that Qatar's emir arranged a special aircraft with medical facilities for the former prime minister.Enamul Haque Chowdhury, a close aide of Zia, told reporters that the air ambulance flew Zia to London, where her eldest son Tarqique Rahman has been in exile since 2007. Rahman is also the acting chairman of Zia's Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and is expected to lead the party toward the election.Zia's planned visit to London comes when Dhaka is embroiled in uncertainty, with Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus-led interim government in charge of the country since Hasina's ouster on August 5 last year.The BNP has been negotiating with the Yunus-led government for a quick election.The party initially demanded polls in three months, but later said it wanted to allow the interim government more time. However, the party is now pressing for an election sometime this year.Zia was sentenced to 17 years in jail under Hasina's rule in two corruption cases stemming from 2001-2006 when she was prime minister.In November, easing the way for Zia's political comeback, the Bangladesh high court acquitted the former prime minister severing a 7-year sentence in a corruption case.Zia was lodged in the Old Dhaka Central Jail on February 8, 2018, after a special court sentenced her to five years in prison in the Zia Orphanage Trust corruption case.On October 30, 2018, the high court raised her punishment to 10 years. However, later, she was convicted in the Zia Charitable Trust corruption case.Amid the Covid outbreak, the government temporarily released Zia from jail after 776 days through an executive order, suspending her sentence on March 25, 2020, with conditions that she would stay in her Gulshan house and not leave the country.After Sheikh Hasina was ousted from Bangladesh in the wake of a mass uprising against her government, Zia was completely freed by an order of Bangladesh President Mohammed Shahabuddin.Zia served as the prime minister of Bangladesh from March 1991 to March 1996, and again from June 2001 to October 2006.","Khaleda Zia left for London on Tuesday night for medical treatment.

The Inspector General of Police has been tasked with ensuring the accused are apprehended and presented before the tribunal.This is the second arrest warrant issued against Hasina, who fled to India following the collapse of her Awami League-led government amid unprecedented anti-government protests in August. Complaints of crimes against humanity and genocide during the July-August mass uprising have further intensified legal scrutiny.Prosecutors allege that Hasina’s administration established a culture of state-sponsored enforced disappearances. Chief Prosecutor Mohammad Tajul Islam told reporters that elite law enforcement units such as the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) and the Directorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI) were frequently used to abduct individuals, with many victims never returning.Last month, the interim government formally requested Hasina’s extradition from India. While New Delhi acknowledged receiving the request, it has refrained from commenting publicly.The ICT has recorded multiple cases against Hasina, including accusations of genocide and crimes against humanity. A commission established by the interim government has reported 1,676 complaints of enforced disappearances during her tenure, alleging that 27% of victims remain unaccounted for.","Interim government revokes passports of 97 individuals, including ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.

Tibet-Nepal Tragedy: Most Powerful Quake Hits; Buildings Collapse Like A Pack Of Cards | Watch

Aftershocks and historical seismic activity

A powerful earthquake of magnitude 7.1 struck the remote Tibetan plateau near the Nepal border on Tuesday, leaving at least 126 dead and over 180 injured in its wake, news agency AFP reported. The tremor, which hit Tingri County in Tibet's Xigaze City , caused buildings to collapse, roads to fracture, and sent goods tumbling off supermarket shelves, sparking panic across the region. Dozens of aftershocks followed, further complicating rescue operations.Footage captured in Shigatse showed shoppers fleeing as goods toppled, while rescue workers scoured mounds of debris in a desperate hunt for survivors. China’s ministry of emergency management confirmed at least 1,000 homes were damaged, leaving streets littered with rubble and cars crushed under fallen debris.The earthquake struck at 9.05 am local time, at a shallow depth of 10 kilometres, according to the US Geological Survey (USGS). Its epicentre was in Tingri County, a sparsely populated area with just under 7,000 residents across 27 villages. Reports indicate significant damage to infrastructure, with authorities deploying over 3,000 rescuers and activating emergency relief measures.As rescue operations continue, the death toll stands at 126, with more than 180 injured. Many remain trapped under rubble, while freezing temperatures and ongoing aftershocks complicate rescue efforts. Shigatse, one of Tibet's holiest cities, suffered significant damage, reminiscent of its plight during the 2015 Nepal earthquake Chinese President Xi Jinping called for “all-out efforts” to rescue trapped residents, minimise casualties, and secure shelter for displaced families. The central government dispatched 22,000 disaster relief items, including winter supplies like tents and quilts, to the region, which experiences harsh winters at altitudes exceeding 4,000 metres.In Nepal, the tremors were strongly felt in the capital, Kathmandu, 230 kilometres away, and other northern districts, forcing residents to flee to open spaces. Though no fatalities were reported in Nepal, minor damage to buildings was recorded, particularly in high-altitude areas like Solukhumbu near Mount Everest.Approximately 50 aftershocks were recorded within hours, with magnitudes reaching up to 4.5. The Tibetan plateau, situated at the collision zone of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates, is highly prone to earthquakes. Past disasters in the region include the devastating 2015 earthquake that killed nearly 9,000 people in Nepal and caused significant damage in Tibet.Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama expressed condolences, saying he was ""deeply saddened"" by the loss of life and destruction. Meanwhile, the Chinese military deployed drones and air support to assess the disaster zone, with Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing overseeing relief efforts on-site.","A magnitude 7.1 earthquake hit Tibet on Tuesday, causing severe damage in Tingri County.

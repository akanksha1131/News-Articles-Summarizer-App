Syria authorities name HTS military chief as transitional defence minister,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/syria-authorities-name-hts-military-chief-as-transitional-defence-minister/articleshow/116843945.cms,"Some of the thousands gathered at the historic Umayyad Mosque in Damascus, for the first Friday prayers since rebels toppled President Bashar Assad of Syria, on Dec 13, 2024.

DAMASCUS: Syria's new authorities announced on Tuesday that the military chief of the Islamist group that spearheaded the offensive that toppled longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad had been appointed defence minister in the transitional government.""The General Command announces the nomination of General Murhaf Abu Qasra as defence minister in the new government of the Syrian Arab Republic,"" said a statement carried by the official news agency SANA.Abu Qasra, 41, a former agronomist, led the armed wing of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) for five years.As commander of the Islamist rebel forces, he played a key role in the offensive that ousted Assad on December 8 after a lightning advance from north Syria to the capital Damascus.On Sunday, Abu Qasra was given the rank of general in a decree from HTS chief Ahmed al-Sharaa, now Syria's de facto leader.Some other key positions in the transitional government, headed by Mohammad al-Bashir, have already been filled.Bashir, who led the rebels' self-proclaimed ""Salvation Government"" in their northwestern Idlib bastion, was made interim prime minister until March 1.In an interview with AFP on December 17, Abu Qasra used his real name for the first time after years of going by his nom de guerre Abu Hassan al-Hamawi, which referenced his native Hama region in central Syria.He said in the interview that HTS would be ""the first"" to dissolve its armed wing and integrate into the national forces, demanding that other groups do the same.Abu Qasra also said that the new leadership would seek to extend its authority to semi-autonomous, Kurdish-held areas in Syria's north and northwest.In the interview, Abu Qasra called on the international community to ""find a solution"" to repeated Israeli strikes and an ""incursion"" into Syrian territory in the wake of Assad's fall.Leader Sharaa has also criticised Israel's military action, which he said ""threatens a new unjustified escalation in the region"".But he noted that ""the general exhaustion in Syria after years of war and conflict does not allow us to enter new conflicts.""","Abu Qasra, 41, led the armed wing of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham for five years.

Israel eliminates Hamas commander Abd al-Hadi Sabah linked to Kibbutz Nir Oz attack on October 7,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/israel-eliminates-hamas-commander-abd-al-hadi-sabah-linked-to-kibbutz-nir-oz-attack-on-october-7/articleshow/116843596.cms,"The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed on Tuesday the elimination of senior Hamas commander Abd al-Hadi Sabah in a targeted drone strike. Sabah, a Nukhba Platoon Commander in Hamas' Western Khan Yunis Battalion, was reportedly instrumental in orchestrating the October 7, 2023, attack on Kibbutz Nir Oz, which resulted in widespread casualties.According to an official IDF statement, the strike that killed Sabah was carried out in southern Gaza’s Khan Yunis area.The operation, coordinated with Israel's Security Agency (ISA), targeted Sabah based on precise intelligence.The IDF’s statement, shared on X, described Sabah as one of the key figures behind the infiltration of Kibbutz Nir Oz during what it termed the “murderous October 7 Massacre .” Sabah was also accused of spearheading multiple attacks against IDF troops throughout the ongoing conflict.“Abd al-Hadi Sabah, who operated from a shelter in the Humanitarian Area in Khan Yunis, was one of the leaders of the infiltration into Kibbutz Nir Oz during the October 7 Massacre,” the IDF’s post stated. “The IDF and ISA will continue to operate against all of the terrorists who took part in the October 7 massacre.”The IDF also revealed that its forces, in collaboration with the Shin Bet (Israel's General Security Service), recently eliminated 14 Hamas militants, six of whom were directly involved in the October 7 attack. These operations were executed under the command of the IDF’s 162nd ""Steel"" Division, which has been actively engaged in Gaza’s Jabalia and Beit Lahia regions.The October 7 assault by Hamas marked one of the deadliest attacks in recent history, claiming over 1,200 Israeli lives and resulting in more than 250 hostages being taken. While efforts to secure the release of hostages continue, approximately 100 individuals remain in captivity, with many feared dead.In retaliation, Israel launched a large-scale counteroffensive aimed at dismantling Hamas’ infrastructure in Gaza. The campaign, however, has led to significant civilian casualties, with Palestinian deaths exceeding 45,000, according to local reports. The rising humanitarian toll has prompted international calls for an immediate ceasefire.","IDF confirms elimination of senior Hamas commander Abd al-Hadi Sabah in targeted drone strike.

Possible reasons for plane crashes in 2024



Increased air traffic in the post-pandemic world: After the COVID-19 pandemic, the world has seen a strong bounce back in global air travel. With more scheduled flights, there is a resultant increase in the volume of air traffic, increasing the likelihood of accidents, but only slightly. The increased number of flights means that even with a low rate of accidents per flight, there will be a higher number of incidents.

Weather conditions: Many of the crashes reported in 2024 occurred under extreme weather conditions. For instance, flights in dense fog, thunders, and icy conditions make the general flying conditions uncertain. In general, adverse weather conditions are commonly attributed to pilot error, mechanical failure, and delays in responding to emergency situations, factors that often lead to crashes.

Mechanical failures and technical issues: Modern aircraft are designed to prevent crashes. However, sometimes mechanical failures or system malfunctions can cause crashes. Engine failure, hydraulic failure, or even electronic malfunction are some of the common problems. Such issues mostly occur in old aircraft that haven't been updated.

Pilot and human errors: Despite advances in automated systems, human error remains a significant contributing factor in many aviation accidents. Pilots may misinterpret weather conditions, miscommunicate during flights, or fail to respond appropriately to technical malfunctions. As the aviation industry grows and air traffic increases, the potential for pilot fatigue or lapses in judgment also increases.

Small aircraft accidents: In 2024, most reported accidents involve small aircraft, and they are highly accident-prone compared to the commercial jets. They are exposed to more severe weather conditions, and they suffer more mechanical breakdowns. Sometimes, private pilots may not enjoy the same rigorous training as well as equipment resources that the pilots of commercial airlines do, increasing the risk for accidents.

Increased exposure: The media report on aviation accidents in a much broader and faster scale as is evident from the emergence of the concept of social media. These make the visibility of every occurrence very high even though it is a relatively rare accident. Frequency of report by media creates an impression of frequent occurrence even though the real number of occurrences remains low.

Regulatory and compliance issues: In contrast, regulations and standards over aviation have improved significantly from previous years; however, every country and air company does not apply the same degree of strictness in observing safety measures. Financial constraints in certain regions, as well as insufficiently trained or out-of-date equipment, sometimes make the rate of accidents there relatively higher than elsewhere. Most accidents in 2024 could be traced back to either some form of technical failure or failing in safety controls.

It has been a disastrous year for the world of aviation in 2024, which raised the world's concerns over safety in flying. Two major accidents in December of this year-the one in South Korea and the other in Azerbaijan-took almost 220 lives, which had cast a shadow over global air travel. These disastrous events that happen during holidays remind the world of questions about the reliability of flight transport and services airlines provide throughout the globe.It has made phenomenal improvements in safety over the years but reminds the world that risks will be part of the situation, particularly those involving extreme weather or technical failures.Except for these South Korea and Azerbaijan crashes, small aircraft across the world suffer fatal accidents of 2024, including within Scotland, Brazil, and also Papua New Guinea, and within Malawi. A military incident led to a tragic accident. Fatalities indicate that many small aviation accidents are found to be in commercial and private aviation due to technical failure as well as several other reasons; adverse weather might be one main reason, which is human-related, and several security issues prevail.Thus, this series of accidents educates about the vast importance of continued vigilance in aviation safety, with the authorities, airlines, and manufacturers needing to be steadfast in eliminating any such future tragedies.On 28 December 2024, a tragic accident occurred when a Boeing 737-800, operated by Jeju Air, crashed while making an emergency landing at Muan Airport in South Korea. The flight was headed from Bangkok, Thailand, to Seoul. It belly-landed, veered off the runway, and caught fire upon hitting a wall. Tragically, all 175 passengers and 4 of the 6 crew members on board were killed. Only two crew members survived, rescued from the wreckage. The disaster took place during the peak holiday season, creating an emotional shock from the crash.Azerbaijan Airlines flight J2-8243 was traveling from Baku, Azerbaijan, to Grozny, Russia. On December 25, 2024, the flight crashed near Aktau, Kazakhstan. The aircraft reportedly suffered from altitude and speed issues, potentially due to mechanical failure. The plane declared an emergency and began its descent, which was complicated further by dense fog. Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev later stated that the aircraft had been shot at from the ground in Russia, which may have contributed to its failure. The crash claimed 39 lives, but 29 people survived. This raised concerns on both mechanical failure and external interference in flight operations.A small aircraft with a pilot aged 50 crashed on December 23, 2024, near the Fife Airport in Scotland. It has been reported that the aircraft performed unusual maneuvers immediately after takeoff before plummetering down to a field. The investigators are trying to check whether it is a result of human error, mechanical failure, or bad weather conditions. The incident raises again the risk factor associated with the smaller aircraft, which in most cases lack up-scale technology common in bigger commercial aircraft.December 22, 2024 - A private plane, piloted by Brazilian businessman Luiz Claudio Galeazzi, crashed in the town of Gramado, Brazil. The small plane carrying Galeazzi, his wife, three daughters, and five other members of the Galeazzi family, struck the chimney of a building, followed by a house and a shop. The crash killed all the passengers on board and injured at least 17 people on the ground. The cause of the crash is yet to be ascertained, but the collision with buildings and the injuries to bystanders indicate that it was in a highly populated area, which has brought into question the safety of private flights over urban zones.On December 22, 2024, a Britten-Norman BN-2B-26 Islander aircraft of North Coast Aviation crashed in Morobe Province, Papua New Guinea. The aircraft was on a flight from Wasu Airport to Lae-Nadzab Airport. Unfortunately, all five people on board were killed. The cause of the crash is not known; however, weather or technical problems are suspected to have led to the accident. Papua New Guinea's rugged terrain and frequent weather problems make flying in the country especially dangerous.On December 20, 2024, a Cessna plane flying from Porto Velho to Manaus in Brazil disappeared. The wreckage and the bodies of two people inside-the pilot and the passenger-were discovered in the Amazon rainforest on Christmas Day. The reasons for the disappearance are still being investigated, but the area was remote, and the possible mechanical failure of the plane may have led to the crash.On 17 December 2024, a Kamaka Air LLC-operated Cessna 208B Grand Caravan crashed on take-off from Daniel K. Inouye International Airport, Honolulu, Hawaii. It reportedly entered into an uncontrolled descent shortly after lifting off the ground, doing a sharp left bank before impacting into a building. Both pilots died in the crash. Initial reports indicate possible flight control malfunctions and a problem with the mechanical condition of the aircraft.On December 17, 2024, a Bombardier BD-100-1A10 Challenger 300 aircraft crashed near San Fernando Airport in Argentina. The pilots on board died when the aircraft missed the runway, hit a perimeter fence, collided with a tree, and caught fire. The cause is still under investigation, but it seems that pilot error or equipment failure may have contributed to the crash. It marks the importance of proper training and aircraft maintenance in preventing runway-related accidents.On August 23, 2024, a domestic charter flight, TFT209, operated by Thai Flying Service Co, crashed 100 kilometers southeast of Bangkok. The aircraft, a Cessna Caravan C208B, crashed while en route from Suvarnabhumi to Trat. All 9 people on board were killed. Weather conditions and possible mechanical failure are under investigation as potential causes of the crash. This incident serves as a reminder of the risks involved in charter aviation, particularly with smaller aircraft.It happened on August 11, 2024, when an ATR-72 turboprop owned by VoePass crashed in the town of Vinhedo, Brazil. The flight was from Cascavel to head to São Paulo, which happened due to bad weather and a technical failure, killing the 62 passengers on board. The crash was one of the deadliest in Brazil in recent history. Many believe it boils down to proper aircraft maintenance and crew training.On July 24, 2024, a CRJ-200 plane of Saurya Airlines crashed while taking off from Kathmandu's Tribhuvan International Airport en route to Pokhara. Nineteen people died in the crash, with one survivor on board, a captain. Rescue operations were more challenging as the aircraft caught fire after the crash. Mechanical failure, human error, or adverse weather conditions are being probed as contributing causes.On June 10, 2024, a military plane carrying Malawi's Vice President Saulos Klaus Chilima, among others who were headed from Lilongwe to Mzuzu crashed with all the people on board succumbing to death. These individuals included former Malawi's First Lady, Shanil Dzimbiri. The crash has been suspected of being contributed to by weather visibility and mechanical breakdown.On May 19, 2024, the U.S.-made Bell 212 helicopter carrying Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi and six other passengers crashed in the mountainous Varzeqan region near the Azerbaijan border. All on board the helicopter were killed. It is suspected that weather and geography contributed to this accident.A Northwestern Air plane, with workers from the global miner Rio Tinto on board, crashed near Fort Smith in the Canadian Northwest Territories January 23, 2024. Six were confirmed dead - two crew members and four passengers. Only one was reported alive from the accident.The incident stirred concerns regarding air travel to such remote locations since rescue teams as well as other weather factors often make the operation a complicated process.On January 2, 2024, Japan Airlines Airbus A350-941 crashed against a smaller Coast Guard aircraft on the runway of Tokyo's Haneda airport. While all 379 people on board the JAL flight survived, five of the six crew members in the Coast Guard aircraft were lost in the incident. The accident, which occurred in ground operations, remains under investigation, but it is suspected to be due to a mishandling of the runways or failure of some equipment.The apparent increase in plane crashes in 2024 can be attributed to several factors, even though the general rate of aviation accidents has decreased over the years due to improvements in safety protocols, technology, and regulations. High-profile crashes this year, however, have stirred up public concern and renewed scrutiny on the safety of air travel. Some of the key factors that may explain why people perceive more crashes in 2024:","Pilot error, mechanical failures, and mechanical system malfunctions are factors that often lead to crashes. The increased number of flights means that even with a low rate of accidents per flight, there will be a higher number of incidents. As the aviation industry grows, the potential for pilot lapses increases.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116827752,imgsize-83654,width-400,resizemode-4/116827752.jpg"

There are countries out there that are so small, so remote, or so obscure that they've barely made it onto your radar. These hidden gems are often overshadowed by more famous destinations, yet they have rich histories, vibrant cultures, and stunning landscapes waiting to be explored. From tiny island nations to landlocked territories with fascinating traditions, the world is full of countries that deserve more attention.Whether it's the quirkiness of the name or the location of uniqueness and interesting facts, there must surely be something about these 7 hidden nations to astound you. Want to get informed about some of the world's greatest secrets? Well, pack your bags because, believe it or not, all of these lesser-known countries are off the beaten track.Kiribati is an island nation located in the central Pacific Ocean. It consists of 33 islands, of which 20 are inhabited. The country occupies a very large area of approximately 3.4 million square kilometers, thus ranking as one of the most geographically spread countries in the world. South Tarawa is the capital, which lies on the largest and most populous atoll. The official languages are English and Gilbertese, and the population is mainly Micronesian and Christian.Kiribati is special because it is the first country to welcome every new day, as it lies west of the International Date Line. It is also the home of Kiritimati Island, the largest coral atoll in the world, which is part of the Line Islands group. Interestingly, Kiribati is the only country situated in all four hemispheres: northern, southern, eastern, and western.The locals pronounce the word ""Kiribati"" as ""Kiri-bas,"" replacing 't' with an 's.'As the most incredible fact of its own, Kiribati is the only nation with all of its islands divided among four hemispheres, located in Micronesian regions. Its atolls fall directly across the equator.Kiribati is also one of the most vulnerable countries affected by climate change. The rising sea level has fully submerged one of its atolls. There is an indication from the UN reports that Kiribati might become uninhabitable by 2100 if climate change trends are maintained.Located close to the Philippines, Palau is an archipelago comprising more than 300 islands, which are distributed over six island groups. The beautiful country in question has a long history of foreign influence, because it has been ruled throughout the centuries by various empires such as Spanish, German, Japanese, and Americans. Palau gained medium independence in 1994 as it entered a Compact of Free Association with the United States, which still remains a formative influence for the current political and economic environment of Palau. Palau has a small population of around 18,000. The country is also famous for its commitment to environmental conservation, especially the marine protected areas. It is considered one of the most favorite destinations for eco-tourism. The cultural heritage of Palau is a mix of Micronesian and Polynesian influences, with both Palauan and English as official languages.Palau follows a very strict matrilineal system, and women are the primary decision-makers. This cultural pattern affects most of the matters in life, such as inheritance, marriage, and funerals, which focus on women.One of the unique Palau cuisines is fruitbat soup-a delicacy made from fruit bats, coconut milk, ginger, and spices. Such a dish has cultural values, and many people in this country enjoy it.Interestingly, Palau is one of the few independent nations that does not have a military. Under the Compact of Free Association with the United States, Palau relies on the U.S. for defense against foreign threats. However, the country maintains a small Maritime Surveillance Unit of 30 personnel who monitor its coastal waters.Tuvalu is a small Polynesian nation situated roughly halfway between Hawaii and Australia. It comprises nine coral atolls scattered across the central Pacific Ocean. While Tuvalu is endowed with an idyllic setting and natural beauty, the low-lying geography makes the country face immense challenges, as its average elevation stands at only three meters above sea level. Tuvalu has approximately 11,000 people and uses fishing, agriculture, and remittances from Tuvaluan citizens working abroad to survive. Being one of the smallest and most isolated nations in the world, it has become a key nation in international debates about climate change and environmental issues. It is also famous for its sense of community, rich Polynesian culture, and its effort to preserve its traditional way of life.Tuvalu is the smallest country in the UN in terms of population. Its estimated population is a mere 11,192 people, ranking 193rd in the world.The country uses the Australian Dollar, which can prove quite challenging to get in Fiji; the only place offering flights to Tuvalu. It has no ATMs as well.Tuvalu has a mean elevation of just two meters, a height that makes it most susceptible to rising sea levels caused by climate change. Coastal erosion is already observed in two of its nine islands.Comoros is an island nation that falls between Madagascar and Mozambique in the Indian Ocean. It has four main volcanic islands: Mayotte, Anjouan, Moheli, and Grand Comore. Comoros is a land with very diverse cultures: African, Arab, and French heritage. This country has an amazing nature: beautiful beaches, verdant forests, and volcanic mountains. Moroni is its capital city and it lies on Grand Comore, which is also the biggest of all these islands. Despite its beauty, Comoros faces a lot of economic challenges and political instability. The nation is mostly an agricultural economy and relies on the production of ylang-ylang for perfume production. Comoros is also one of the least developed countries in the world, facing poverty and unemployment, but its unique geography and rich cultural diversity make it interesting.The origin of the name ""Comoros"" is the Arabic term for ""moon,"" which is pronounced ""qamar."" The moon is also represented on the national flag of Comoros.Comoros was a French colony before gaining independence from France in 1975, with the exception of the island of Mayotte, which remained a French territory.The country's main export partners are France, India, and Germany, and its main import partners are the UAE, France, and China.Among its two islands, Barbuda is one of the territories that make up the independent country of Antigua and Barbuda, which gained its independence from the United Kingdom back in 1981. Being more silent and peaceful compared to Antigua, Barbuda is located to the north. The island is rich in untouched natural beauty because Barbuda is famous for its pure beaches, crystal-clear water, and peaceful atmosphere, creating a hidden gem for travel. The island boasts a population of approximately 1,600 residents who are highly connected to the nation's rich cultural background. In combination, the islands of Antigua and Barbuda present a unique synthesis of history, culture, and tourism that is very lively while Barbuda offers a haven for people looking for the more relaxed experience.Among its prize-winning beaches is the incredible Pink Sand Beach, one of the most beautiful and unique beaches in the world, known for soft, pinkish sand and crystal-clear waters.Codrington Lagoon of the small uninhabited island in Barbuda is Frigatebird Sanctuary. Thousands of frigatebirds find shelter and nest there-they form one of the largest populations of these magnificent birds found in the world.With only about 1,600 people, Barbuda is one of the least populated islands in the Caribbean, giving it a serene and calm atmosphere compared to its busting neighbor, Antigua.","Kiribati is the only country situated in all four hemispheres: northern, southern, eastern, and western.

The Pentagon on Monday repatriated a Tunisian detainee who was brought to the US military prison at Guantanamo Bay, the day it opened, was never charged at the war court and was approved for transfer more than a decade ago. Ridah Bin Saleh al Yazidi , 59, spent years languishing at the wartime prison because deals could not be made to repatriate or resettle him.He was airlifted from the base in a secret operation that was completed 11 months after the defence department notified Congress that it had reached an agreement to return him to Tunisian custody, the Pentagon said. It offered no details on the security arrangements surrounding his return.Yazidi's transfer was the fourth in two weeks in a late Biden administration push to reduce the detainee population at the prison, which held 40 prisoners when President Biden took office. His departure left 26 detainees, 14 of them approved for transfer to other countries with diplomatic and security arrangements. Another nine are in pretrial proceedings or convicted of war crimes. The prison enters its 24th year in Jan.Yazidi was the last of a dozen Tunisians once held at the prison, most of whom were captured in Afghanistan or Pakistan after the Sept 11 attacks and brought to Guantanamo Bay as terrorism suspects. He was sent to the wartime prison the day it opened, Jan 11, 2002, and so was photographed kneeling anonymously in a crude open-air compound at Guantanamo's Camp X-Ray in one of the detention operation's most iconic photos.With his transfer, only one other person among those original 20 detainees is still held at the prison: Ali Hamza al-Bahlul, who is serving a life sentence for conspiring to commit war crimes as a media adviser to Osama bin Laden. nyt","Ridah Bin Saleh al Yazidi, 59, spent years languishing at the wartime prison because deals could not be made to repatriate or resettle him.

Brad Spafford arrested

150 explosive devices discovered

Neighbor alerted authorities

The Federal Bureau of Investigation recently uncovered 150 explosive devices, mostly pipe bombs, at a Virginia home—a cache federal prosecutors have called the largest collection of ""finished explosive devices"" in the FBI's history. A Virginia man, Brad Spafford, has been arrested in connection with the discovery. He was initially taken into custody for possessing an unregistered short-barreled rifle.Brad Spafford was arrested on December 17 at a farm near Norfolk, following a single-count criminal complaint alleging his illegal possession of an unregistered short-barrel rifle.Upon searching Spafford's 20-acre property in Isle of Wight County, federal agents discovered over 150 explosive devices, primarily pipe bombs, in a detached garage. Some were marked ""lethal."" Additional pipe bombs were found inside Spafford's home within a backpack displaying a grenade-shaped patch and a ""#NoLivesMatter"" logo, according to prosecutors.The ""#NoLivesMatter"" logo is associated with a far-right ideologypromoting violence.Prosecutors in US District Court in Norfolk submitted documents detailing Spafford's explosives to support their request to keep him detained until trial. They described the discovered explosives as the largest collection of ""finished explosive devices"" in FBI history.The investigation into Spafford began in 2023 after a neighbor alerted authorities, as reported by the website Court Watch. The neighbor claimed Spafford lost three fingers on his right hand while working with a homemade explosive. According to the neighbor, Spafford was accumulating weapons and ammunition and had expressed being ""preparing for something"" he ""would not be able to do alone.""The neighbor reported Spafford used President Biden's photos for target practice and believed ""political assassinations should be brought back."" After the attempted attack on then-President-elect Trump in July, Spafford allegedly told his neighbor he ""hoped the shooter doesn't miss Kamala.""During an October visit to Spafford's farm, the neighbor, wearing a recording device, said Spafford discussed having various explosives and plans to fortify his property with ""a 360-degree turret"" for a .50-caliber rifle.","Brad Spafford was arrested on December 17 at a farm near Norfolk, Virginia.

It’s salt added to the wound,” said retired FDNY lieutenant Jim McCaffrey, whose brother-in-law, Battalion Chief Orio Palmer, died after reaching the 78th floor of the South Tower. “If anybody deserves the death penalty, these terrorists do.”The plea agreements, signed by Pentagon official Susan K Escallier, have been criticised for bypassing victims’ families. Sally Regenhard, who lost her firefighter son Christian in the attacks, expressed outrage: “These people should have been tried at the scene of the crime in Manhattan federal court, just blocks from Ground Zero.”The original allegations came to light in July when reports revealed the deal, prompting widespread backlash. Austin initially revoked the agreements, giving families a glimmer of hope, but the appeals court rejected his authority to intervene.Maureen Santora, whose firefighter son Christian also died on 9/11, condemned the decision. “Taking the death penalty off the table is deeply disturbing and unjust. These terrorists were responsible for killing nearly 3,000 people. They even told us at Guantanamo Bay, ‘We’d do it again,'""he was quoted as saying by the New York Post.Critics have also linked the case to broader concerns over clemency under President Biden. Retired NYPD officer Jim Smith told the New York Post, “This is part of Biden’s MO. He’s released murderers and rapists.

Fingerprint data helped investigators



Why did Zapeta-Calil set the woman on fire?



The remains of the victim of the New York subway horror were mostly ashes, placing the investigators in front of a dead end as establishing the identity of the victim became a challenge. What they could gather immediately after the victim was set on fire was that she was an adult woman and had some mobility issues because there was a walker by her side.Rest was in the dark while accused Sebastian Zapeta-Kalil said he had no memory of setting the woman on fire.10 days after the horrific incident for which the NYPD drew flak for their nonchalant behavior, the investigators revealed that the woman was 61-year-old Debrina Kawam from New Jersey. She was a homeless person. There is no evidence that Kawam knew Zapeta-Calil, the 33-year-old illegal migrant, who set her on fire.Investigators established the identity of the victim through fingerprint data, dental records and DNA evidence as there was nothing else. They also gathered surveillance footage from the subways hoping to find a clear image of the woman's face before the fire.The woman was already on the train when Zapeta-Calil boarded it in Queen. They both rode to the end of the line in Coney Island.After arrest, the perpetrator said he had no memory of the incident. They did not know each other. Hence, the horrific incident looks like a freak one that the perpetrator did out of intoxication. Kawam was sitting motionless, probably asleep, when Zapeta-Calil walked up, took out a lighter and set her on fire. He then stepped out of the train and sat on a bench staring at the fire and the smoke. When he set her on fire, he also waved a shirt at her which only helped the fire spread.When Zapeta was witnessing his victim burning down, a viral video showed one NYPD official passing by as the people on the platform were screaming, When the NYPD reached the woman, Zapeta was still on the platform but they did not notice him as they tended to Kawam. Their body cameras captured him and then his photos were released. Three teenagers called 911 and informed the police that Zapeta-Calil was aboard another train in Brooklyn.","Debrina Kawam, 61, was sleeping when she was set on fire.

Jill Biden hasn't been a fan of Kamala Harris since the 2020 election when Harris accused Biden in a debate of opposing busing policies that desegregated schools she attended as a young Black girl.Though Joe Biden never publicly blamed Kamala Harris for the election loss and wholeheartedly endorsed her as a capable candidate to defeat Trump, now as his presidency is coming to an end, he said that his list of regrets includes opting out of the presidential race.Following Biden's debate performance on June 27 on CNN which was called disaster, Biden dropped out of the campaign on July 21. Kamala Harris got a relatively shorter time for her campaign, though she never blamed Biden for her election defeat. However, there were clashes between the two teams and Kamala Harris could not openly disagree with Biden's policies to lure more voters as she was part of all crucial decisions of the Biden administration.Biden has recently told his associates that he would have won the election but did not hold Kamala Harris responsible for his withdrawal from the race.During the campaigning, there were several instances when Joe Biden's action could be interpreted as sabotage to Harris' campaigning and her campaign was reportedly frustrated with Biden's comments like calling Trump supporters 'garbage' etc.The WSJ report said that the belief that Biden could have won isn’t widely shared in the White House or among the Democratic establishment, where the more common view is that the party would have suffered a much larger electoral defeat and lost even more congressional seats had Biden remained the nominee. White House aides, many who’ve been on job searches since early November, described the work environment in recent weeks with words like “draining” and “depressing.”","The Bidens and Kamala Harris appeared so distant in public that many speculate that the Bidens did not even vote for her.

What took so long to identify the victim?



Who is Debrina Kawam? What we know about her



Who is Amelia Carter?



Almost 10 days after a woman was torched in a subway car in New York City, the NYPD could finally identify the woman as New Jersey's Debrina Kawam , a 61-year-old homeless person. Kawam was sleeping on the train at the Stillwell Avenue-Coney Island station 7.30 AM on December 22 when illegal Guatemalan immigrant Sebastian Zapeta-Calil set her on fire.The incident sent a shockwave across the country as shocking visuals of the incident surfaced on social media.In those visuals, the woman was seen standing in the fire inside the train while people were recording her footage and exclaiming -- instead of throwing a blanket on her. An NYPD officer was also seen walking by in a viral footage.Initially, the NYPD only revealed that the victim was an adult woman and probably had some mobility issue which prohibited her from running away from the fire. Wrapped in a blanket and under many layers of clothes, she was sleeping inside the train, when Zapeta-Calil approached her and set her blanket on fire. Zapeta also fanned a shirt near her so that the fire spread. The woman remained immobile while Zapeta walked out of the train and saw the woman burning inside. The woman stood up when she was completely gutted.The woman was charred beyond recognition and there was no easy way to establish the identity of the woman. Police found a walker at the site which indicated that she had some mobility issues.Police also concluded that she was a homeless person as no relatives filed any missing complaint either.The identity could finally be established through fingerprints, the New York Post reported.Little is known about the 61-year-old homeless victim of the horrific incident. Police confirmed that she was homeless and she had a walker and several bags nearby.Social media users dug up a Facebook profile by the name of Debrina Kawam and claimed that she was a former business and marketing manager at a pharmacy. But it is not confirmed whether the profile actually belonged to the victim.Amelia Carter is a false identification of the NYC subway horror victim spread on social media along with an AI-generated photo.","Debrina Kawam, 61, was sleeping on the train at the Stillwell Avenue-Coney Island station 7.30 AM on December 22 when illegal Guatemalan immigrant Sebastian Zapeta-Calil set her on fire.

A Parsi family that knows all about booze in Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/a-parsi-family-that-knows-all-about-booze-in-pakistan/articleshow/116842907.cms,"In 1947, when the British transferred power to India and Pakistan, many businesses also changed hands. One of them was Murree Brewery , among the oldest distilleries in Asia, which was then largely owned by a British family. The Bhandaras of Lahore became its new owners. They were a Parsi family that had thrived in the liquor business.Isphanyar Bhandara now runs Pakistan's top brewery.He recently made a brief halt in New Delhi on his way to Nepal. ""It's my tenth visit to India,"" the businessman-politician said cheerfully, a Pakistan flag lapel pin on his coat the only green in his otherwise blue attire.Liquor business is heavily regulated in the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. About 96% of the country's population is Muslim. The brewery, accordingly, points out on its website, ""Under the country's laws Pakistan Muslims are prohibited from consuming alcoholic drinks. Non-Muslims and foreigners require a consumption permit.""Nonetheless, the business has been rewarding for the Bhandaras. ""The forbidden fruit is always sweet,"" said Isphanyar. ""We make beers from Australian barley. Our vodkas and single malts are also doing very well. It's all about quality. We also make and export fruit juice and are heavily into (bottled) water,"" he added.Success though hasn't been limited to the arena of trade. Isphanyar is also a member of the Pakistan National Assembly . His father was a central minister under Zia-ul-Haq in the 1980s and an MP during the Pervez Musharraf regime.But, as a community, the Parsis have wilted. In 1947, Isphanyar says, about 20,000-25,000 of them lived in Pakistan. Like in India, they played a major role in nation-building, especially in cities like Karachi. They were among the top businessmen and jurists and were engaged in philanthropic work. In the 19th century, Parsis were also among the early cricketers of Karachi. According to an article in scoreline.org, a team of Parsi cricketers toured England in 1886. In 1952, when Pakistan's cricket team toured India, southpaw batter Rusi Dinshaw was part of the squad, although he didn't get to play a Test.""Today, we are less than 1,000,"" says Isphanyar. ""Most of the Parsi population is in its 80s or 90s, a bit like the Japanese. There are very few young Parsis in Pakistan today,"" he said.Many left due to economic reasons, others due to law and order issues. One such migrant was the renowned writer Bapsi Sidhwa, whose novel, Ice Candy Man, was made into a feature film called 'Earth' by director Deepa Mehta. Sidhwa passed away in Houston on Dec 25 last year; she was Isphanyar's aunt.The 54-year-old businessman gets raw material and machinery from India. ""A lot of companies in Pakistan do. The problem is, it is via Dubai,"" he said. But there are other reasons why he wants more trade between the two neighbours.""We can disagree on Kashmir, put it on the back burner. We don't have to concede our position and India doesn't have to concede theirs. But we should keep the baggage of history aside and look at the common good of the common people. We should open the Wagah border,"" he said.More business will benefit the underprivileged, he believes. ""We need it for the common man - dal, roti, cheeni, stuff like that. It will lower the inflation in Pakistan. I've made my presentations to our Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif saab. I'm keeping my fingers crossed,"" he said.Not many know that the brewery - it gets its name from the scenic resort town - was set up in 1860, just three years after the 1857 revolt, to mainly service British troops. Edward Dyer, father of Reginald Dyer, the perpetrator of the 1919 Jallianwala Bagh massacre, was its first manager. By 1890, water shortage and other logistical issues had forced the distillery to shift to the Rawalpindi area, where it continues to be headquartered.There was a time when Murree Beer was sold in India. ""In fact, Pakistan railways had put up tracks inside the brewery that used to carry beer to places like Kabul, Amritsar and, of course, to Karachi port,"" he said. But the state of politics and, consequently, policies, changed in Pakistan in the late 1970s when, exceptions aside, alcohol was banned. But as reputed Dawn columnist Nadeem Paracha wrote in 2013, ""Despite the violence and the eventual prohibition on the (open) sale of alcohol and bars in Pakistan in April 1977, Pakistanis never did stop drinking.""About two decades back, a possible joint venture project proved abortive. ""In 2006, when Vijay Mallya (former chairman of United Spirits) visited Pakistan to watch a cricket match, the prospect of doing something together was broached with my father. But politics did not allow them to come together,"" he said.Political relations between the two countries have further dipped now. But Isphanyar is an optimist. He wants the situation to improve. And more Indo-Pak trade , he insists, is the way to begin.","In 1947, when the British transferred power to India and Pakistan, many businesses also changed hands. The Bhandaras of Lahore became its new owners. They were a Parsi family that had thrived in the liquor business.

The ' Uraan Pakistan ' five-year National Economic Transformation plan is aimed at steering the country towards sustainable growth from macroeconomic stability, the premier said while addressing the launching ceremony here.The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz leader said the government has set an investment target of USD 10 billion annually and an enabling environment is being created to attract local investments as well.Sharif said privatisation and outsourcing are vital to save huge losses for which political dialogue is necessary and for which the private sector will be encouraged""Today is a historic day as we commence the journey of Uraan Pakistan,"" he said, and added that the purpose of the programme is development and it is important that all stakeholders work together.The prime minister credited the public for enduring economic hardships and pledged to build on the current stability, describing it as ""only the beginning"".Sharif also criticised the previous government for straining relations with ""friendly nations"", stating that their conduct left Pakistan isolated on the global stage.He outlined goals for economic reforms, expressing hope that Pakistan's current agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) would be its last.""Through hard work, we can achieve success. Inflation has visibly decreased and the collaboration between the government and institutions continues to strengthen,"" he said.The prime minister stressed on the need for reducing the cost of inputs like electricity and gas to ensure sustainable growth. He said local industries should be made more compatible to save foreign exchange and expand exports, emphasising that export-led growth is the only option to make Pakistan a stronger economy.He also highlighted the coalition government's struggle to stabilise the economy during Pakistan's 2023 financial crisis.""When we were on the brink of default and striving for the IMF programme, we decided to prioritise saving the state over politics,"" he said.Praising the collaboration between government institutions, he said, ""I have never seen such a partnership before. My prayer is for this unity to endure as we move forward with solidarity and determination, learning from past mistakes.""Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said ""Uraan Pakistan"" aims at attaining a sustainable GDP growth rate of six per cent by 2028, one million jobs annually, and ten billion dollars private investment per year.He said this plan is accompanied by a comprehensive implementation mechanism to hit the export target of 60 billion dollars by fiscal year 2028.He added that PM Sharif established a delivery unit at the prime minister's office (PMO) to coordinate the implementation of sectoral plans and roadmaps.""Pakistan recorded a fiscal surplus for the first time in 24 years, reduced inflation from 38 per cent to 5 per cent and improved the policy rate from 13 per cent to 22 per cent. The stock market is now the second-best performing globally, and investor confidence - both local and foreign - has surged,"" he said.Aurangzeb emphasised that the programme is laying the groundwork for sustainable economic growth, adding, ""This is a turning point for the nation's economic stability.""Radio Pakistan reported that Uraan Pakistan is built on pillars of 5Es, entailing exports, e-Pakistan, environment, including food and water security, energy and infrastructure as well as equity, ethics and empowerment.The plan would place Pakistan on a path of sustainable high growth moving towards a stronger and more prosperous future with the commitment to build a solid foundation to transform Pakistan into a trillion dollar economy by 2035 and a three trillion dollar economy by 2047.",Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif unveils national plan for fast-track economic development.

"Pakistan's textile exports face setback, fall short of $17 billion amid political instability",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistans-textile-exports-face-setback-fall-short-of-17-billion-amid-political-instability/articleshow/116833378.cms,"Pakistan's textile industry, which was once poised to achieve higher export earnings, started to lose its momentum, as per The Express Tribune.2024 has been a challenging year for this crucial sector, often referred to as the backbone of the nation's industrial economy.In the fiscal year 2023-24, textile exports saw a modest growth of 0.93 per cent, generating a substantial USD 16.7 billion in export revenues.However, during the first five months of FY25, textile exports reached USD 7.607 billion, reflecting a 10.51 per cent increase compared to the same period last year Express Tribune reported.In the first 11 months of 2024, textile exports totaled just USD 15.43 billion. Industry millers anticipate that the December figure could be approximately USD 1.5 billion, resulting in the year ending with exports falling short of USD 17 billion.Ijaz Khokhar, Patron-in-Chief of the Pakistan-textile-exports, stated, ""The early months of this calendar year were relatively good for the textile industry, particularly exports, as they showed a positive trend.""The positive trend started to decline after the initial months. The primary cause was ongoing political instability, which has persisted for more than two years. Khokhar remarked, ""We have lost at least 40 per cent of our export orders because buyers, hesitant to trust Pakisttextile millers due to political challenges, are shifting their orders to Vietnam.""Others noted that Pakistan also missed the chance to secure orders that were diverted from Bangladesh due to its political turmoil. Waqas Hanif, a mid-sized textile miller from Lahore, said, ""Textile millers in Pakistan should have fully taken advantage of the opportunity created by the political change in Bangladesh. However, our millers have been unable to meet the demand because of price differences.""According to the Express Tribune report a significant portion of the demand was once again redirected to Vietnam, as Pakistani millers lacked product diversification. Hanif highlighted, ""Vietnam is far more advanced in the textile and other sectors. They offer a wide range of products and are able to offer lower prices.""Pakistan was once the top choice for international buyers due to its competitive prices. However, the country has consistently struggled with product diversification. Over the past decade, the government, textile millers, analysts, and foreign buyers have all emphasized the need for diversification.While a few millers are making efforts, the industry as a whole remains far from developing the new products required by European Union and American buyers. The government's support in this area has also been lackluster. Some economists caution that ongoing political tensions, along with stringent measures from the finance ministry and the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), could severely harm the sector, which remains the largest source of export revenue.""The local industry has not been growing for years, so how can we expect product diversification or an increase in export revenue?"" asked Ahmad Aziz Subhani, an economist based in the UAE.Recently, the FBR included the textile sector in the standard tax regime, requiring millers to pay a 2 per cent advance tax instead of the previous 1 per cent. Furthermore, they are now obligated to submit all their business information to the FBR.Subhani stated that following the tax increase, many Pakistani textile companies have been relocating to Dubai. ""So far, about 400 companies have set up offices in Dubai and registered with the Dubai Chamber of Commerce. This will likely lead to under-invoicing of export orders by several Pakistani millers, further reducing export revenue,"" he added.The report further stated that many textile industry leaders highlight that the sector is heading in the wrong direction.""We are struggling with high energy costs, which have led to a reduction in mills and a shift of orders to Vietnam. We are uncertain about how many billions of dollars we've lost because of this,"" said Ashraf Ali, a textile retailer based in Faisalabad. He further mentioned that a cotton crisis is looming, as nearly half of the spinning units have shut down due to a liquidity shortage and delays in the FBR's release of sales tax refunds.""We should expect a rise in yarn prices and a shortage of the product in 2025,"" Ali added. The industry is also awaiting the start of Trump's second term, as many factors depend on the policies the incoming US president will implement.Many millers argue that any restrictions, whether due to political instability or other factors, would have a detrimental impact on Pakistan's textile industry. They also pointed out that the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war and the conflict in the Middle East could further escalate tensions and affect the global economy.In summary, textile exports for the current fiscal year are likely to decline or remain flat due to the various challenges the industry is facing. The sector has almost given up on reaching its USD 25 billion export target, as they believe that without a clear textile policy and the active involvement of key stakeholders in decision-making, achieving this goal would remain an unrealistic aspiration.

Diplomatic efforts amid rising hostilities

What lies ahead?

Tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan have escalated into deadly clashes at the border, leaving at least eight individuals dead and 13 others, including civilians, injured on the Afghan side. The ongoing conflict, which persisted into late Saturday night, comes amidst the growing strain between the two nations, once considered allies.The violence followed an intense exchange of fire, reportedly triggered by Pakistan's targeted airstrikes on alleged camps of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in Afghanistan's eastern Paktika province earlier in the week.Pakistani security officials claim the strikes were a response to a failed infiltration attempt by militants from Afghanistan.According to Pakistani sources, militants attempting to breach the border on Friday night were repelled by Pakistani forces. The following morning, these militants allegedly joined Afghan forces to launch coordinated attacks on Pakistani border posts using light and heavy weapons. The attacks targeted several areas, including Ghozgarhi, Matha Sangar, Kot Ragha, and Tari Mengal.Pakistani forces retaliated, reportedly inflicting significant losses and forcing the attackers to abandon their posts. However, the violence also claimed the life of one Frontier Corps soldier and left 11 others injured.Pakistan has long accused the Afghan Taliban of harboring TTP militants who have intensified attacks on Pakistani security forces in recent months. These attacks, particularly in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan regions, have heightened security concerns in Islamabad.While urging the Afghan government to take decisive action against the TTP, Pakistan said that dialogue between the two nations could not occur amidst ongoing violence.While these diplomatic calls were failing, tensions flared after Pakistan's airstrikes in the Barmal district of Paktika on December 24, which reportedly killed at least 46 individuals, including women and children. The Taliban's ministry of defense condemned the strikes, describing them as an attack on civilians and vowing retaliation.The airstrikes came on the same day a Pakistani delegation led by Special Representative Muhammad Sadiq met Afghan leaders in Kabul in an attempt to resume diplomatic dialogue after a year-long hiatus. However, the Afghan government lodged a formal protest over the airstrikes, accusing Pakistan of targeting civilians rather than militants.The escalating conflict comes against the backdrop of strained relations following the TTP's termination of a ceasefire with Pakistan in November 2022. Since then, attacks by the TTP have claimed the lives of numerous Pakistani soldiers, further deteriorating ties between the neighbors.The renewed border violence, marked by both airstrikes and ground clashes, shows a growing distrust between Kabul and Islamabad. While Pakistan continues to demand action against the TTP, the Afghan Taliban denies harboring militants and accuses Pakistan of targeting civilians under the guise of counterterrorism operations.","Tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan have escalated into deadly clashes at the border.

GWADAR: The inauguration of the New Gwadar International Airport (NGIA) has been delayed for the third time due to ongoing security concerns in the region.Originally scheduled to begin operations on January 1, 2025, the airport, which is a key part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), will now remain closed indefinitely, the Balochistan Post reported.Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) has also cancelled its first commercial flight, which was set to coincide with the opening, according to reports from The Balochistan Times.The NGIA, a major infrastructure project funded by China at a cost of USD 250 million, is designed to accommodate large aircraft such as the Airbus A380. The airport's original opening date of August 14, 2024, was planned to coincide with Pakistan's Independence Day celebrations but was postponed due to protests organised by the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC).The second delay followed a series of deadly attacks by the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), which targeted key CPEC-related infrastructure, including highways, railway bridges, and mineral transport vehicles, as reported by The Balochistan Post.This latest delay highlights the growing security risks posed by Baloch separatist groups that oppose Chinese investments in the region.The BLA, a major armed group advocating for Baloch independence, has repeatedly targeted Chinese projects and nationals in Pakistan. Notable attacks include a 2018 suicide bombing on a bus carrying Chinese engineers, assaults on the Chinese Consulate in Karachi, and a 2023 attack in Gwadar that killed 13 people, including four Chinese nationals.The BLA has also warned foreign nationals to avoid Balochistan, calling it a ""war zone,"" according to The Balochistan Post.In response to these threats, the Civil Aviation Authority and the Balochistan government have decided to review security arrangements before proceeding with the airport's opening. The BLA's Majeed Brigade has vowed to continue its campaign against Chinese interests, further complicating Pakistan's efforts to maintain stability and attract foreign investment to the region.","The inauguration of the New Gwadar International Airport has been delayed for the third time.

The boy, identified as Balach, son of Sabrullah, is from the Panjgur district, and his family members claimed that he was forcibly taken from his home ten days ago during a raid by Pakistani forces.According to The Balochistan Post, Balach was reportedly subjected to physical abuse before being taken away while still injured.Authorities have yet to comment on the incident, which has sparked concern among local and international human rights organisations.The Pakistani military's repeated targeting of the family has been documented, with previous incidents including a raid on their residence where property was damaged and two hand grenades were thrown outside, though no injuries were reported.According to local sources, the forces have conducted regular raids on the house, subjecting the family to continuous intimidation, as per the report.In another incident, Pakistani forces detained a man identified as Fazal Bashir in the coastal city of Gwadar. Fazal, a resident of Hirabad area in Kech district, was detained on December 23, and his location remains unidentified, according to The Balochistan Post.His family has sought assistance from human rights organisations to determine his whereabouts, worried about his safety. The persistent issue of enforced disappearances in Balochistan continues to draw attention, with local activists and human rights organisations demanding accountability and the release of missing persons.Despite continuous calls for justice, these incidents highlight the ongoing accusations against Pakistani security forces in the region.The families of Balach and Fazal have requested authorities to investigate their cases and provide information about their missing relatives.Balochistan continues to witness systematic abductions and killings, affecting various segments of society including activists, politicians, journalists and civilians, who are reportedly taken by security forces, according to news agency ANI.The Pakistani military faces frequent accusations of using enforced disappearances as a tactic against insurgents and separatist groups. Human rights organisations and Baloch nationalist groups argue that these abductions aim to suppress opposition.These disappearances often lead to torture and extrajudicial killings, intensifying the human rights situation in the region, the report added.","The boy, identified as Balach, is from the Panjgur district of Balochistan.

May 9 Riots and aftermath

International outcry

Pakistan's response

Pakistan's military courts have sentenced 60 more civilians to prison for their alleged involvement in the violent May 9, 2023, riots that targeted military sites and other facilities following the arrest of former Prime Minister Imran Khan This brings the total number of convictions related to the unrest to 85, according to announcements from the military’s Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).Among those sentenced is Hassan Niazi , Khan’s nephew, who received a 10-year prison term for his alleged role in the attack on the Lahore Corps Commander’s residence, also known as Jinnah House.The ISPR stated that the Field General Court Martial handed down the sentences after reviewing evidence and ensuring due process. “Sequel to the announcement of the May 9 punishments... the Field General Court Martial has promulgated the punishments to the following remaining 60 culprits after examining all evidence, ensuring the provision of all legal rights to the convicts, completion of due process, and the appropriate legal proceedings,” the ISPR announced.The convicted individuals face sentences ranging from two to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment. They have the right to appeal the decisions under Pakistan's Constitution.The unrest on May 9 erupted after Imran Khan’s arrest in a corruption case. Supporters of Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party allegedly attacked key military installations, including the Army General Headquarters in Rawalpindi, the Corps Commander’s House in Lahore, and an ISI office in Faisalabad.In response, authorities detained hundreds of individuals, and 103 were handed over to military courts for trial, sparking widespread criticism of the opaque judicial process.The convictions have drawn sharp rebukes from international entities, including the United States, United Kingdom, and the European Union. Critics argue that the use of military courts to try civilians undermines judicial independence and transparency.“These military courts lack judicial independence, transparency, and due process guarantees,” the US State Department said. Similarly, the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth, and Development Office (FCO) criticized the lack of transparency and independent oversight in the trials, emphasizing the importance of adhering to fair trial standards under international law.The European Union also expressed concern, highlighting that Pakistan’s actions contradict its obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and commitments tied to the GSP+ trade program.The Pakistani government has defended the use of military courts, citing the Supreme Court’s decision that allowed the military to proceed with trials of civilians involved in the riots. The Foreign Office reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to international human rights obligations, asserting that the trials were conducted in accordance with national laws.The ISPR emphasized that the convictions reflect the military’s resolve to uphold justice and maintain the authority of the state, stating, “The Nation, Government, and Armed Forces remain steadfast in their commitment to upholding justice and ensuring that the inviolable writ of the state is maintained.”","Pakistan's military courts have sentenced 60 more civilians to prison for their alleged involvement in the violent May 9, 2023, riots.

This has been the fourth time in the past few years that Pakistan has conducted airstrikes inside Afghanistan, and the second time since March 2024.“Last night (Tuesday), Pakistan bombarded four points in Barmal district of Paktika province. The total number of dead is 46, most of whom were children and women,” said Zabihullah Mujahid, spokesperson for the Afghan Taliban govt. He added that six others, mostly children, were wounded.Condemning the airstrikes, the Afghan defence ministry called them “barbaric” and a clear “aggression”. It stated that several refugees, including women and children, were killed and injured. “The Pakistani side should understand that such arbitrary measures are not a solution to any problem,” Enayatullah Khowarazami, spokesperson for Afghanistan’s defence ministry, wrote on social media platform ‘X’. “The Islamic Emirate (Afghan Taliban regime) will not leave this cowardly act unanswered, but rather considers the defence of its territory and sovereignty to be its inalienable right,” he added.The strikes took place hours after Pakistan special representative for Afghanistan Mohammad Sadiq met interim Afghan foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi and interior minister Sirajuddin Haqqani in Kabul, intending to resume diplomatic dialogue after a year-long gap. The deteriorating ties, however, are likely to worsen following Tuesday night’s airstrikes, analysts said.Pakistan alleges the Afghan government harbours armed groups, particularly the TTP, which conducts cross-border assaults against Pakistani security forces. In one of the worst recent assaults on security forces, the TTP had claimed responsibility for the killing of at least 16 Pakistani soldiers in South Waziristan last week.Kabul, however, denies providing shelter to armed groups or allowing their territory to be used for cross-border attacks.Border tensions between the two countries have surged since the Taliban regime took control in 2021, with Pakistan experiencing a revival of militant activity along its western border. Deadly air attacks by Pakistan’s military in Afghan border regions in March, which the Taliban claimed killed eight civilians, had sparked confrontations along the the disputed border between the two countries.","Pakistani security officials said the airstrikes took place in Murgha and Laman areas of Barmal district, in Afghanistan’s eastern Paktika province.

Yet now, the same individuals are lobbying internationally against these courts,"" Tarar said.He assured that military trials adhere to fair trial principles and dismissed claims of injustice in military trials.The military courts tasked to hear cases of suspects involved in the attacks on military facilities on the May 9, 2023 protest last week sentenced 25 civilians to prison terms ranging from 2-10 years.Khan's party criticized the verdicts, arguing that military courts have no jurisdiction over civilians.",Information minister Attaullah Tarar says military courts are competent to deal with cases related to attacks on army facilities.

Pakistan has repeatedly accused the Afghan Taliban of providing shelter to TTP fighters, who have increased attacks on Pakistani forces in recent months. In response, the Afghan Taliban denies these allegations, asserting that civilians, not militants, were targeted in the latest strikes.“The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan considers this a brutal act against all international principles and blatant aggression and strongly condemns it,” said the Afghan ministry of defence. “The Islamic Emirate will not leave this cowardly act unanswered but rather considers the defense of its territory to be its inalienable right.”Islamabad contends that many TTP leaders and fighters have fled to Afghanistan, finding refuge in border provinces under Taliban protection. Afghan officials, however, have refuted these claims, stating that the victims of the bombings were primarily displaced civilians.The strikes came just after Mohammad Sadiq, Pakistan’s special representative for Afghanistan, visited Kabul for discussions on trade and bilateral relations.

International and local reactions

Thousands of protesters, led by student activists, marched through Dhaka on Tuesday, calling for the prosecution of ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Demonstrators demanded justice for the deaths of hundreds during a mass uprising that toppled Hasina’s 15-year rule in July.The “March for Unity,” organised by the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement , began at Dhaka’s Central Shaheed Minar.Protesters chanted for Hasina’s trial and urged the banning of her Awami League party. Addressing the rally, movement convener Hasnat Abdullah declared, “Since August 5, we have no more enemies in Bangladesh. Our only enemy is the Awami League.”Hasina fled to India on 5 August following weeks of violent unrest in which security forces were accused of suppressing protests with excessive force. The uprising, which claimed hundreds of lives, ended her tenure as the country’s longest-serving prime minister.Last week, Bangladesh formally requested India to extradite Hasina, who faces numerous charges, including crimes against humanity for the deaths of protesters. A note verbale, a formal diplomatic message, was sent to India on Monday.Bangladesh’s foreign adviser Touhid Hossain confirmed the development, stating, “We sent a note verbal to the Indian government, saying the Bangladesh government wants her back here for judicial process.” India’s Ministry of External Affairs acknowledged receipt of the request but declined further comment.Under the 2013 extradition treaty, amended in 2016, murder charges are excluded from being classified as “political offences.”""Extradition may be refused if the offence for which it is requested is an offence of a political character,"" the treaty states.Bangladesh’s interim government, led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, has committed to prosecuting those responsible for the bloodshed. Yunus has sought international cooperation, including from the International Criminal Court. “We will seek the return of the fallen autocrat Sheikh Hasina from India,” Yunus said.Meanwhile, Hasina’s son, Sajeeb Wazed, has criticised the charges as politically driven. Speaking from the US, he called the accusations a “witch hunt” aimed at undermining his mother’s legacy.","Demonstrators demand justice for the deaths of hundreds during a mass uprising that toppled Hasina’s 15-year rule in July.

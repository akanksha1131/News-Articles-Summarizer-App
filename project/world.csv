Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi has become the first hospital in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region to deploy the Artisse Intrasaccular Flow Modulator, a cutting-edge device for treating wide-necked brain aneurysms. As a designated Centre of Excellence for stroke by the Department of Health – Abu Dhabi, the hospital continues its commitment to advancing minimally invasive neurological care while offering safer, more effective alternatives to traditional brain surgery.Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi has introduced a novel advancement in neurovascular care with the adoption of the Artisse Intrasaccular Flow Modulator, a specialized implant designed to treat wide-necked intracranial aneurysms. This technology represents a new standard in stroke treatment across the MENA region.Cerebral aneurysms, often referred to in broader terms as strokes, develop when a weakened section of a brain blood vessel expands or balloons. If left untreated, they pose a high risk of rupture and can lead to subarachnoid hemorrhage, a life-threatening form of brain bleeding. Traditionally, treatment involved invasive open brain surgery.However, new approaches are shifting towards minimally invasive techniques, significantly reducing patient risk and improving long-term outcomes.The Artisse device, unlike older methods which typically require multiple coils or filaments, uses a single intricately designed mesh structure that is deployed directly into the aneurysm. This device fills the aneurysmal sac, blocking blood flow into it and permanently sealing it off from the brain’s circulation. It remains in place for life, eliminating the need for follow-up surgeries.The procedure begins with catheter-based access, typically through the groin or arm, to reach the affected vessel in the brain. Using advanced 3D imaging and angiography, physicians position the device with precision. Depending on the complexity, the procedure can take between two and eight hours. Post-operative follow-ups are critical; imaging is usually conducted at three and six months to ensure full occlusion of the aneurysm.The first patient treated with the Artisse device at Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi showed successful aneurysm occlusion in their three-month follow-up, affirming the device’s therapeutic potential.Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi’s Neurological Institute has long adopted a multidisciplinary model of care, combining the expertise of specialists in neurosurgery, interventional neuroradiology, and neurology. This approach ensures that patients receive personalized treatment plans, guided by the latest imaging and catheter-based innovations.According to Dr. Khalil Zahra, Staff Physician of Neurosurgery at the Neurological Institute:Dr. Zahra also emphasized the long-term potential:The Department of Health – Abu Dhabi (DoH) has formally recognized Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi as a Centre of Excellence for stroke care, further reinforcing the hospital’s regional leadership in specialized treatment pathways.Dr. Fayeza Al Yafie, Executive Director of the Healthcare Quality Sector at DoH, commented on the significance of this development:This milestone reflects not only a technological breakthrough but also the outcome of sustained collaboration between Cleveland Clinic and Mubadala Investment Company. Their long-term partnership has enabled a level of care within the UAE that reduces the need for patients to seek complex treatment abroad.Established through a partnership agreement in 2006, Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi was envisioned as a transformative step in healthcare delivery for the region. The facility officially opened its doors in May 2015, after nearly a decade of meticulous planning. More than 300 physicians and clinical staff worked in collaboration with architects, designers, and planners from around the world to shape the hospital’s advanced care environment.Backed by a bold initiative from the Government of Abu Dhabi, the hospital was designed to expand access to critical and complex care services that were previously unavailable locally.Today, Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi operates as part of a global institution that spans:The official inauguration took place on December 3, 2015, led by Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, then Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces.By introducing the Artisse Intrasaccular Flow Modulator, Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi has taken another decisive step toward redefining neurological care in the MENA region, combining cutting-edge science, collaborative care, and a vision for long-term innovation.","Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi has become the first hospital in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region to deploy the Artisse Intrasaccular Flow Modulator.

‘You’ve got to be yourself’: JD Vance hits out at Newsom for imitating ‘Trump-style’ posts; says Democrats need authenticity,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/youve-got-to-be-yourself-jd-vance-hits-out-at-newsom-for-imitating-trump-style-posts-says-democrats-need-authenticity/articleshow/123422047.cms,"File photo: US Vice President JD Vance (right) and California Governor Gavin Newsom (Picture credit: AP)





US Vice President JD Vance on Wednesday ridiculed California Governor Gavin Newsom for imitating President Donald Trump ’s social media style, calling the approach inauthentic and unlikely to help Democrats win over voters.Speaking on Fox News’s The Ingraham Angle, Vance dismissed the strategy as misguided. “This idea that Gavin Newsom is somehow going to mimic Donald Trump’s style, I think that ignores the fundamental genius of President Trump’s political success, which is that he’s authentic,” Vance said.“He just is who he is,” Vance added. “You’ve got to be yourself. You’ve got to talk to people honestly about the issues.”Newsom, considered a potential 2028 Democratic presidential contender, has in recent weeks rolled out a new online strategy that mirrors Trump’s distinctive approach, long, capitalised rants, dismissive nicknames for rivals, boasts about his policies, and posts laced with exclamation marks.According to the New York Times, his press office X account, which once shared routine policy updates, has transformed into a parody of Trump’s Truth Social feed, branding him “AMERICA’S MOST FAVORITE GOVERNOR.”The change comes amid Democrats’ post-2024 election soul-searching, with some party figures arguing they need a sharper, Trump-like tone to compete. Vance, however, urged them to rethink. “Some free political advice from the president of the United States, stop sounding like crazy people,” he said.“Don’t be a crazy person. Be authentic. If the Democrats did that, they’d do a hell of a lot better.”Vance also pointed to what he called the success of Trump’s federal crime crackdown in Washington, DC, where the president declared a public safety emergency on 11 August.According to the vice president, violent crime dropped 35% and robberies fell 55% in just nine days. “These numbers highlight that law and order is a question of political will,” he told Fox News. “If you’ve got the political will to enforce the law, you can make even cities like DC safe again.”Newsom, for his part, has defended his mocking online style. He argued it is a deliberate attempt to expose Trump’s rhetoric by reflecting it back. “If you’ve got issues with what I’m putting out, you sure as hell should have concerns about what he’s putting out as president,” the governor recently said, as reported by the New York Times.His office has continued with the approach after seeing a surge in online engagement, with follower numbers climbing significantly this month.While some Democrats have embraced the strategy as “fighting fire with fire,” critics say it risks looking childish. Conservative commentator Tomi Lahren recently declared that Newsom had “embarrassed himself” to the point of being disqualified from higher office.Vance’s blunt message, however, was that no amount of theatrics can replace policy. “Gavin Newsom can mimic Donald Trump all that he wants to, but they’re still going to lose unless they get better policies that actually serve the American people”.",US Vice President JD Vance ridiculed California Governor Gavin Newsom for imitating President Donald Trump ’s social media style.

Mail-in voting trends





US President Donald Trump on Monday announced that he would lead a movement to abolish mail-in ballots and voting machines before the 2026 midterm elections, saying they fueled “massive voter fraud” and undermined confidence in the electoral process.In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump said he planned to sign an executive order aimed at eliminating what he described as “highly inaccurate” and “controversial” voting machines, while pushing for traditional paper ballots with watermarks.According to Trump, paper ballots were faster, more reliable, and left “no doubt” about election results. “I am going to lead a movement to get rid of MAIL-IN BALLOTS, and also, while we’re at it, Highly ‘Inaccurate,’ Very Expensive, and Seriously Controversial VOTING MACHINES, which cost Ten Times more than accurate and sophisticated Watermark Paper,” he posted.He added that the effort, which he expected Democrats to oppose, would help bring “honesty” to the 2026 midterm elections. “We are now the only Country in the World that uses Mail-In Voting. All others gave it up because of the MASSIVE VOTER FRAUD ENCOUNTERED,” Trump wrote.Trump argued that states were merely “agents” of the federal government in counting and tabulating votes and insisted they must follow presidential directives “for the good of the country.”He accused Democrats of relying on mail-in voting to remain competitive due to their “radical left” policies. “With their HORRIBLE Radical Left policies, like Open Borders, Men Playing in Women’s Sports, Transgender and ‘WOKE’ for everyone, and so much more, Democrats are virtually Unelectable without using this completely disproven Mail-In SCAM,” Trump said.“Elections can never be honest with mail-in ballots or voting machines, and everybody knows it, especially the Democrats,” he added.Trump’s comments came days after his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Following the meeting, Trump said Putin agreed with him on ending mail-in balloting.""Vladimir Putin, smart guy, said you can't have an honest election with mail-in voting,"" Trump told Fox News after Friday's Alaska summit.Mail-in voting allows eligible voters to cast ballots through the postal system. It includes absentee ballots, used when voters cannot reach polling stations due to illness, travel, or other valid reasons, and mail-in ballots, which can be requested by any eligible voter in many states.A mail-in ballot refers to the actual ballot paper that voters complete and return by mail under this system.Although mail-in voting has long been part of the US election process, Trump has repeatedly attacked it since the 2020 presidential election, claiming it enabled widespread fraud.However, election officials and courts have found no evidence of large-scale fraud linked to mail-in ballots.Despite Trump’s opposition, several Republican-led states, including Florida, have embraced mail-in voting as a secure and convenient method of expanding voter participation. Trump himself voted by mail in previous elections and had encouraged his supporters to do the same for the 2024 presidential election.Mail-in ballots reached record highs in 2020, when states expanded options amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Usage declined in 2024, according to the US Election Assistance Commission.In the 2024 general election, more than two-thirds of voters cast ballots in person, while about three in 10 voted by mail. Every US state offers some form of absentee or mail-in ballot option, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.","US President Donald Trump announced he would lead a movement to abolish mail-in ballots and voting machines before the 2026 midterm elections.

Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Monday said he would deploy 4.5 million members of the country’s militia in response to what he described as renewed threats from the United States, after Washington raised the bounty for his arrest and launched anti-drug operations in the Caribbean.""This week, I will activate a special plan with more than 4.5 million militiamen to ensure coverage of the entire national territory -- militias that are prepared, activated and armed,"" Maduro announced on state television.The militia, created by Maduro’s predecessor Hugo Chavez, is officially said to number about five million, though the real figure is believed to be lower. Venezuela’s overall population is around 30 million.Maduro denounced what he called ""the renewal of extravagant, bizarre, and outlandish threats"" from Washington.Earlier this month, the administration of US President Donald Trump doubled its reward to $50 million for Maduro’s capture. He faces US drug trafficking charges, with Washington accusing him of leading the Cartel de los Soles, a network it blames for large-scale cocaine smuggling. The Trump administration also announced sanctions against the group and the Venezuelan government last month.The US military has reportedly dispatched several vessels to the southern Caribbean as part of Trump’s campaign against Latin American drug cartels.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Tuesday said President Donald Trump had directed that the US-Mexico border wall be painted black, arguing that the dark surface would make it too hot for migrants to climb.Speaking at a press conference in Santa Teresa, New Mexico, Noem said, ""that is specifically at the request of the president, who understands that in the hot temperatures down here, when something is painted black, it gets even warmer, and it will make it even harder for people to climb.”“Now, if you look at the structure that’s behind me, it’s tall, which makes it very, very difficult to climb, almost impossible.

And today, we are also going to be painting it black"", she added.Trump had signed what he called a “big, beautiful bill” last month, allocating $165 billion to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The bulk of the funds were earmarked for strengthening the southern border and deporting migrants who were in the country illegally. Of this, $46.5 billion was dedicated to the construction of the new border wall, work on which had begun during Trump’s first term in the White House.Noem said the wall would also undergo a technological upgrade with the addition of “technology, cameras, sensors.”Reports of Trump’s plans to paint the border wall black had first surfaced during his earlier administration in 2020, when officials confirmed they were testing a black coating along certain sections.","Trump administration pushes for US-Mexico border makeover; paint walls black to deter migrants.

Yosemite National Park: Ranger fired for hanging transgender pride flag on El Capitan; justice department eyes charges,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/yosemite-national-park-ranger-fired-for-hanging-transgender-pride-flag-on-el-capitan-justice-department-eyes-charges/articleshow/123399493.cms,"Ranger fired for hanging transgender pride flag on El Capitan





A ranger at Yosemite National Park has been dismissed after helping drape a giant transgender pride flag across El Capitan, sparking a wider crackdown on protests at the California landmark.Shannon “SJ” Joslin, a 35-year-old ranger and biologist who studies bats, confirmed they were terminated last week after unfurling the 66-foot-wide flag on 20 May with a group of climbers.The flag, which remained for around two hours, was removed voluntarily. In a letter of dismissal, Yosemite’s acting deputy superintendent said Joslin had “failed to demonstrate acceptable conduct” in their role as a federal employee, reported The New York Times.Joslin, who identifies as nonbinary, was quoted as saying by news agency AP that she had acted out of personal conviction amid policies from the Trump administration that “target trans people.” She added, “I hung the flag as a way to tell myself we’re safe in national parks. Instead, this firing says the opposite, that federal workers who don’t align with this administration must stay silent or be eliminated.”Two other rangers who joined the action have been placed on administrative leave pending investigation, Joslin said.Park officials confirmed the justice department is considering administrative and possible criminal action against both employees and visitors involved.Violators could face fines of up to $5,000 and jail terms of six months.The Park Service tightened rules a day after the incident, banning flags or banners larger than 15 square feet in 94% of the park. “Displaying signs, banners and flags outside of designated First Amendment areas detracts from the visitor experience,” said spokesperson Rachel Pawlitz, as cited by AP.Yosemite, she added, must balance free expression with the protection of wilderness and visitor safety.Advocates have condemned the firing. Environmentalist and drag performer Pattie Gonia, who joined in hanging the flag, was quoted by AP as she called Joslin “a respected pillar within the Yosemite community.”Jayson O’Neill from Save Our Parks claimed the decision was meant to intimidate workers from speaking out, while Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility is now representing Joslin.Demonstrations at El Capitan have become more frequent. Earlier this year, protesters displayed an inverted US flag to criticise Trump-era cuts to the Park Service workforce.Since Trump took office, the service has lost about 2,500 employees, with a further $900 million cut proposed for next year, according to AP.For Joslin, Yosemite was more than a workplace. “Everything I did was off the clock and had nothing to do with my role,” she was quoted as saying by The New York Times.“Yosemite is my whole life”, she added.","Shannon ""SJ"" Joslin, a 35-year-old ranger and biologist who studies bats, confirmed they were terminated last week.

Radioactive shrimps found?

What is Cesium-137, why is it harmful?





The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Monday warned consumers not to eat certain frozen shrimp products sold at Walmart after tests revealed possible contamination with Cesium-137, a radioactive isotope.Federal officials said three lots of Great Value brand frozen shrimp were pulled from Walmart stores after the isotope was detected in shipping containers and a sample of breaded shrimp imported from Indonesia. “If you have recently purchased raw frozen shrimp from Walmart that matches this description, throw it away,” FDA officials said in a statement.Walmart has recalled frozen, raw shrimp sold in 13 states following the warning, the Associated Press reported.Cesium-137, also known as Cs-137, is a byproduct of nuclear reactions, including nuclear weapons testing, reactor operations and nuclear accidents. It is the most common radioactive isotope of cesium, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Cs-137 is also used in medical devices, gauges, and radiation therapy to treat cancer, while in some cases, it emerges as a waste product of nuclear reactors.According to the agency, exposure to low levels of Cesium-137 over time could pose a “potential health concern.”Trace amounts of the isotope are found globally in soil, air and food. While the levels detected in the shrimp were far below FDA intervention thresholds, officials said avoiding potentially contaminated products could help reduce unnecessary exposure to radiation.",FDA warns against consuming certain frozen shrips; cites potential Cesium-137 contamination.

Hurricane Erin’s outer bands brushed North Carolina’s Outer Banks, prompting Highway 12 closure

NHC warned of “life-threatening surf and currents,” storm surge and flooding across US East coast

Evacuations began in Outer Banks; NY, NJ closed beaches as Erin churned northward.





The National Hurricane Center (NHC) warned of “life-threatening surf and currents” along much of the US East coast as Hurricane Erin’s outer bands brushed North Carolina on Wednesday evening.A storm surge warning was issued for Cape Lookout to Duck, North Carolina, while a tropical storm warning was in effect from Beaufort Inlet to Chincoteague, Virginia, including the Pamlico and Albemarle sounds.The NHC advisory at 8 pm ET said hurricane-force winds extended outward up to 105 miles from the storm’s center, with tropical-storm-force winds reaching 265 miles.Hurricane Erin, now a Category 2 hurricane, was not forecast to make landfall in the US. However, ""storm surge will be accompanied by large waves, leading to significant beach erosion and overwash,"" has put beaches in the Bahamas, Bermuda, Atlantic Canada, and the US East Coast at risk.The National Weather Service cautioned that waves could exceed 10 feet in the region. Coastal flood warnings were in place for parts of Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, and along the bay south of the York River.Erin had earlier intensified to Category 5 on Saturday before weakening to Category 3 on Sunday morning. It regained strength later that day, with satellite data and a US Air Force Hurricane Hunter mission showing improved organization.Forecasters expected slow strengthening through Thursday night.North Carolina Governor Josh Stein declared a state of emergency on Tuesday to mobilise resources and assist evacuations in the Outer Banks. Low-lying tourist areas were already being cleared.Precautionary measures extended to the Northeast. New York Mayor Eric Adams announced all city beaches would remain closed for swimming on Wednesday and Thursday “due to dangerous riptides from Hurricane Erin.” New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy also urged residents and visitors to avoid the ocean, citing hazardous currents and high surf.On Tuesday, Erin’s slow northward movement had already unleashed rough surf and dangerous rip currents along the East Coast, triggering dozens of water rescues, swimming bans, and beach closures.","Hurricane Erin's outer bands brush North Carolina's Outer Banks.

"Gerrymandering row: Barack Obama backs Newsom’s redistricting plan in California; calls it a ‘smart, measured’ response to Texas",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/gerrymandering-row-barack-obama-backs-newsoms-redistricting-plan-in-california-calls-it-a-smart-measured-response-to-texas/articleshow/123421265.cms,"File photo: Former US President Barack Obama (Picture credit: AP)





Former US President Barack Obama has thrown his weight behind California Governor Gavin Newsom’s push to redraw House districts, calling the plan a “responsible” way to counter Republican efforts in Texas.Speaking at a Martha’s Vineyard fundraiser on Tuesday, Obama said he admired Newsom’s decision to link California’s proposed changes to Republican-led redistricting elsewhere.“He said this is going to be responsible. We’re not going to try to completely maximise it. We’re only going to do it if and when Texas and/or other Republican states begin to pull these manoeuvres,” Obama remarked, according to the New York Times.The former president, who raised $2 million for the National Democratic Redistricting Committee at the event, added that while he disliked gerrymandering,Democrats could not “unilaterally allow one of the two major parties to rig the game.” He warned, “If we don’t respond effectively, then this White House and Republican-controlled state governments all across the country, they will not stop, because they do not appear to believe in this idea of an inclusive, expansive democracy.”Newsom has proposed a November ballot measure, labelled Proposition 50, that would allow Democrats to bypass California’s independent redistricting commission and enact a party-drawn map.The plan, which he nicknamed the “Election Rigging Response Act,” would only be triggered if Texas or another Republican state pushes through mid-decade changes. If passed, it could reshape five districts currently held by Republicans, boosting Democrats in the 2026 midterms.Obama reinforced that his support was conditional. “Over the long term, we shouldn’t have political gerrymandering in America, just a fair fight between Republicans and Democrats based on who’s got better ideas,” he wrote separately on X on Wednesday.“But since Texas is taking direction from a partisan White House and gerrymandering in the middle of a decade to try and maintain the House despite their unpopular policies, I have tremendous respect for how Governor Newsom has approached this”, he further wrote.Newsom, widely seen as a possible 2028 presidential contender, thanked the former president on Wednesday. “Thank you President Obama for backing Proposition 50 and standing up for America’s democracy,” he posted on X.The redistricting clash has intensified since US President Donald Trump urged Texas leaders to redraw maps in a way that could eliminate five Democratic-held seats.Republican lawmakers in Texas approved the redrawn maps on Wednesday, intensifying the battle over control of the House. In response, Democrats in California, Illinois and New York are weighing counter-moves. Reacting to the Texas bill, Newsom posted on X: “It’s on. See you in November.”According to the LA Times, California lawmakers are expected to vote soon on whether to call the special election.Obama acknowledged the tension between his long-standing opposition to gerrymandering and his present stance.“I wanted just a fair fight … but California is one of the states that has the capacity to offset a large state like Texas,” he told donors, describing Newsom’s approach as a “smart, measured” solution tailored to “a very particular problem in a very particular moment in time.”","Former US President Barack Obama has thrown his weight behind California Governor Gavin Newsom's push to redraw House districts.

The FBI arrested Cindy Rodriguez Singh, one of its “Ten Most Wanted Fugitives,” in India in connection with the murder of her 6-year-old son, Noel Rodriguez Alvarez.Rodriguez Singh had been wanted for the 2022 murder of her son and was placed on the FBI’s most wanted list. On October 3, 2024, Interpol issued a Red Notice against her, which was circulated to all member countries, including India.Singh has been transported to the United States and will be turned over to Texas authorities.Rodriguez Singh was added to the ""most wanted"" list in July this year. FBI had also raised the reward for information leading to her arrest from $25,000 to $250,000.Fox News Digital reported that Rodriguez Singh was facing an active federal warrant for “unlawful flight to avoid prosecution” and a Texas state warrant for “capital murder of a person under 10 years of age.”Authorities said Noel was one of ten children born to Rodriguez Singh. While three siblings lived with their grandparents, the others stayed with her and her husband, Arshdeep Singh, in Everman, a suburb of Fort Worth under squalid conditions.Investigators said Arshdeep Singh, Noel’s stepfather, was of Indian origin. They believed Rodriguez Singh fled the US with him and six of her children to India.Just days after Noel was officially reported missing, the couple and their children boarded a one-way flight to India on March 22, 2023. Noel was not on that flight and had not been seen since.","Cindy Rodriguez Singh was arrested in India in connection with the murder of her 6-year-old son, Noel Rodriguez Alvarez.

ODNI-shakeup: Trump administration orders major cuts to US intelligence office as 40% staff axed; $700 million budget slashed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/odni-shakeup-trump-administration-orders-major-cuts-to-us-intelligence-office-as-40-staff-axed-700-million-budget-slashed/articleshow/123420218.cms,"File photo: US director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard (Picture credit: AP)





The Trump administration has announced sweeping cuts to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), slashing its budget by over $700 million a year and reducing its workforce by more than 40%.As per news agency AP, director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard confirmed the restructuring on Wednesday, saying the changes were designed to end “the weaponisation of intelligence” and restore public trust.“Over the last 20 years, ODNI has become bloated and inefficient, and the intelligence community is rife with abuse of power, unauthorised leaks of classified intelligence, and politicised weaponisation of intelligence,” Gabbard said in a statement, as reported by AP.She added that her goal was to “provide objective, unbiased, timely intelligence” to the president and policymakers.According to Politico, the initiative, described by ODNI as “ODNI 2.0”, will eliminate hundreds of jobs and consolidate several offices, including the Foreign Malign Influence Centre, the Cyber Threat Intelligence Integration Center and the National Intelligence University.Some functions will be folded into other intelligence agencies or the National Defence University.According to Axios, ODNI staff have already been cut from around 2,000 in February, when Gabbard took charge, to about 1,500. Following this restructuring, the number will drop further to roughly 1,300.A senior official cited by Axios said that President Trump had even discussed the possibility of shutting down ODNI entirely, but Gabbard’s review concluded it still serves an “important role” in coordination.Among the most high-profile changes is the dismantling of the Foreign Malign Influence Centre, created in 2022 under President Biden to counter foreign disinformation campaigns. Gabbard claimed it had a “hyper-focus” on elections and had been used to suppress free speech.Emerson Brooking of the Atlantic Council, however, disputed that characterisation, saying the centre’s task was “supposed to solve for redundancy, not add to it,” AP reported.The overhaul has drawn sharply divided reactions in Congress. Senate Intelligence Committee chair Tom Cotton praised the move as a return to ODNI’s original mission. By contrast, Democrat Senator Mark Warner expressed doubts, citing Gabbard’s “track record of politicising intelligence,” while Representative Jim Himes called the cuts “a profound betrayal” of ODNI’s duty to protect Americans.Staff affected by the layoffs will receive 60 days’ notice, Axios reported.In total, Gabbard aims to cut $1.3 billion across all 18 US intelligence agencies in the coming years.","The Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) has been restructured.

A US federal appeals court on Wednesday stayed a lower court’s order that had temporarily protected around 60,000 migrants from Honduras, Nicaragua, and Nepal from deportation. The decision, issued by the 9th US circuit court of appeals in San Francisco, supports the Trump administration’s move to end temporary protected status (TPS) for these groups, reported news agency AP.The three-judge panel, comprising appointees of Presidents Clinton, Bush, and Trump, granted the emergency stay, pausing the earlier July 31 ruling by US district judge Trina L Thompson. Her order had blocked the administration’s attempt to terminate TPS, citing a lack of ""objective review of the country conditions"" in places like Honduras and Nicaragua.TPS shields migrants from deportation and allows them to work legally in the US It can be extended by the secretary of homeland security in cases of war, natural disasters, or unsafe political conditions in a migrant’s home country.Secretary Kristi Noem had determined that conditions no longer justified TPS for 51,000 Hondurans and 3,000 Nicaraguans, with protections set to expire September 8. TPS for 7,000 Nepalis was scheduled to end August 5.The migrants had lived in the US for over two decades following Hurricane Mitch in 1998.Immigration advocates, including the national TPS Alliance, have challenged the decision, alleging it was politically driven and racially motivated. At a Tuesday hearing, US Deputy assistant attorney general Drew Ensign argued the government faced “irreparable harm” if blocked from implementing its policies.Responding to criticism, DHS assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin said, “TPS was never meant to be a de facto asylum system, yet that is how previous administrations have used it for decades.”The next hearing in the case is scheduled for November 18.The Trump administration has also moved to terminate TPS for migrants from several other countries, including Venezuela, Haiti, Ukraine, Afghanistan, and Cameroon. Some of those decisions are under litigation.","US appeals court stays lower court's order that protected 60,000 migrants from Honduras, Nicaragua, and Nepal from deportation.

Vice President JD Vance’s lunch event with national guard troops at Union Station on Wednesday was disrupted by a wave of protests, as demonstrators voiced opposition to the Trump administration’s security deployment in the capital.Vance, joined by defence secretary Pete Hegseth and White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, met National Guard members - many from red states such as South Carolina, Ohio, and Mississippi - at a Shake Shack inside the station. The visit was intended as a gesture of appreciation for troops deployed to patrol Washington, DC, according to CNN.As Vance entered the venue, he was met with a mix of applause and boos. Protesters blocked from entering the second floor of the restaurant chanted “shame,” “this is our city,” and “we want the military out of our streets.” In response, others began chanting “USA.”When questioned by reporters during a brief press interaction, Vance dismissed the demonstrators as “crazy” and “communists.” Miller added, without evidence, that the protesters were “elderly white hippies” and “not part of the city,” as quoted by the news outlet.Referencing his past visit to Union Station with his children, Vance said, “They were being screamed at by violent vagrants, and it was scaring the hell out of my kids.”The visit highlighted ongoing tensions between DC residents and the Trump administration’s decision to deploy federal forces in the city. A Washington Post-Schar School poll earlier found that about 80% of DC residents oppose the move and the federal takeover of the city’s police department.Vance pushed back against those numbers, stating: “I’m highly skeptical that a majority of DC residents don’t want their city to have better public safety and more reasonable safety standards.”A college student at Union Station, who asked not to be named, told CNN, the troop presence felt “overwhelming.” She added, “I thought I had read that the crime rate in DC is actually going down?”While city officials and Democrats have raised similar points, Vance claimed crime is “massively underreported.” When asked for supporting data, he responded: “Just talk to a resident of this city.”Some media reports suggest that the department of justice is currently investigating whether DC’s metropolitan police department manipulated crime data.As Vance concluded the visit and returned to the main level, more boos followed. “I heard you buddy,” he responded to one protester. “This is the guy who thinks people don’t deserve law and order in their own community,” he said to Hegseth.Outside, another group of protesters gathered near parked National Guard vehicles. One sign read: “Criminals out of DC? Start with the Epstein files.”","DC Vice President JD Vance met with national guard troops at Union Station on Wednesday.

No Epstein grand jury transcript unsealing: Judge rejects DOJ’s request; testimony called ‘hearsay’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/no-epstein-grand-jury-transcript-unsealing-judge-rejects-dojs-request-testimony-called-hearsay/articleshow/123417285.cms,"Representative image (AP)





A federal judge in Manhattan has denied the US government's request to unseal grand jury transcripts related to the sex trafficking case against late financier Jeffrey Epstein , saying the records offer limited value compared to the wider case file already held by the department of justice, reported news agency AP.The ruling on Wednesday by US District Judge Richard Berman follows a similar decision by the judge who presided over the case of Ghislaine Maxwell , Epstein’s former associate, who is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence after being convicted of aiding Epstein’s abuse of underage girls.In his order, Berman noted that no victims testified before the grand jury and that the only witness was an FBI agent who had ""no direct knowledge"" of the alleged crimes. The agent’s testimony, described as mostly hearsay, was presented over two sessions on June 18 and July 2, 2019, alongside a PowerPoint presentation and a call log - all of which will remain sealed.Berman wrote, “the grand jury testimony is merely a hearsay snippet of Jeffrey Epstein’s alleged conduct,” adding that the motion to unseal the transcripts appeared to be a “diversion” from the more comprehensive case materials already in the government’s possession, as quoted by the agency.The decision comes amid increased scrutiny over the DOJ’s approach to transparency in the Epstein case. Last month, public backlash followed the justice department’s statement that it would not release additional documents from the investigation.“The government is the logical party to make comprehensive disclosure to the public of the Epstein file,” Berman said, criticising the limited nature of the records it sought to unseal.Meanwhile, Maxwell’s legal team has indicated willingness to cooperate with the House Oversight Committee, which is seeking her testimony as part of a Republican-led probe. However, her lawyers have requested immunity and access to questions in advance, which the committee has rejected. Chair James Comer said the panel was willing to delay her deposition until after her Supreme Court appeal, expected to be resolved in late September.",Federal judge in Manhattan has denied the US government's request to unseal grand jury transcripts related to the sex trafficking case against late financier Jeffrey Epstein.

Ten commandments in Texas schools blocked: Judge cites first amendment; public classrooms exempt for now,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ten-commandments-in-texas-schools-blocked-judge-cites-first-amendment-public-classrooms-exempt-for-now/articleshow/123416429.cms,"Representative image (AP)





A federal judge on Wednesday temporarily blocked Texas from enforcing a new law that would require public schools in Houston, Austin and other districts to display the Ten Commandments in every classroom, ruling that the measure likely violates the US Constitution, reported news agency AP.The ruling came in response to a preliminary injunction request filed by a coalition of families from different faith backgrounds - Christian, Jewish, Hindu, Unitarian Universalist and nonreligious - who argued that the mandate infringes on the First Amendment’s separation of church and state.US district judge Fred Biery, in his 55-page ruling, noted that displaying the religious text in classrooms could lead to students asking questions that teachers would feel obligated to answer.“Even though the Ten Commandments would not be affirmatively taught, the captive audience of students likely would have questions, which teachers would feel compelled to answer. That is what they do,” Biery wrote, as quoted by the agency.The temporary injunction prevents 11 school districts and their affiliates from implementing the law, which was set to take effect on September 1. The judge began his ruling by quoting the First Amendment and ended it with the word “Amen.”Texas is the largest state to attempt such a mandate, and the case is part of a broader legal battle likely to reach the US Supreme Court. A similar law in Louisiana was recently blocked by a federal appeals court, while a judge in Arkansas halted implementation in four districts.Texas attorney general Ken Paxton called the ruling “flawed” and confirmed plans to appeal. “The Ten Commandments are a cornerstone of our moral and legal heritage, and their presence in classrooms serves as a reminder of the values that guide responsible citizenship,” Paxton said in a statement, according to the agency.The families challenging the law are represented by the American civil liberties union, Americans united for the separation of church and state, and the freedom from religion foundation.“Today’s ruling is a major win that protects the constitutional right to religious freedom for Texas families of all backgrounds,” said Tommy Buser-Clancy, senior staff attorney at the ACLU of Texas.A broader lawsuit involving three Dallas-area districts and the state’s education commissioner is still pending in federal court.","A federal judge on Wednesday temporarily blocked Texas from enforcing a new law.

“Anti-American activity will be an overwhelmingly negative factor in any discretionary analysis,” according to a recent policy announcement by the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), the country’s immigration agency.In other words, if you want a visa of any kind – be it a student visa, or a work visa; or wish to apply for a green card or US citizenship – the outcome of your application will depend on whether the concerned official perceives you as having pro-American ideologies“America’s benefits should not be given to those who despise the country and promote anti-American ideologies. USCIS is committed to implementing policies and procedures that root out anti-Americanism and supporting the enforcement of rigorous screening and vetting measures to the fullest extent possible,” said USCIS spokesman Matthew Tragesser. “Immigration benefits—including to live and work in the United States—remain a privilege, not a right,” he added.As per this recent policy, USCIS officials will also scrutinise whether applicants have endorsed, promoted, supported, or otherwise espoused the views of a terrorist organization or group, or whether they support or promote anti-American ideologies or activities, antisemitic terrorism, antisemitic ideologies and antisemitic terrorist organizations.This latest announcement follows similar announcements and policy changes made in earlier months by the Trump administration. For instance, as reported by TOI, in early April USCIS announced that social media accounts would be monitored and international students, those applying for green card status, and those seeking non-immigrant work visas (including H-1B) for jobs affiliated with educational institutions will have their visa applications denied if such individuals are perceived as being antisemitic.Later, in mid-June, USCIS announced reopening of visa interviews for international students (those seeking a F-visa or M-visa) and those aspiring to visit US on an exchange visa (J visa) but stated that such applicants must ensure that their social media accounts are public and not set to private settings. More recently, the definition of ‘good moral character’ – an essential requirement for acquiring American citizenship was revised. USCIS stated it would consider the totality of circumstances, weighing both negative conduct (misdemeanours like driving under influence, or non payment of tax dues) and positive attributes (like educational qualifications, lawful employment history) in determining eligibility for citizenship.Immigration attorneys cite that policies that can grant an individual immigration benefits – be it a US visa, green card or even citizenship are becoming subjective – much is left to the discretion of the official assessing the applications.As regards the latest policy guideline that anti-American activities would be a serious negative discretionary factor, voices on social media were aghast. “Is this the 1950s?”, posted an individual.New York based immigration attorney, Cyrus D. Mehta said, “How does the USCIS define ‘anti-American’. Being critical of the Trump administration or for that matter any administration should not be deemed as anti-American. Indeed, it should be considered a virtuous activity to be critical of America or its administration as it is through criticism and dissent that we can reflect on all points of view, self correct, grow and evolve. ” Another immigration attorney resorted to sarcasm, by posting on a social media platform, “USCIS to deny green cards, if applicants don’t calp loud enough for the national anthem; The Trump Administration has issued a new rule requiring immigrants to pretend they like ranch dressing...""","US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), the country’s immigration agency, has announced that anti-American activity will be an overwhelmingly negative factor in any discretionary analysis. USCIS officials will also scrutinise whether applicants have endorsed, promoted, supported, or otherwise espoused the views of a terrorist organization.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123414265,imgsize-954551,width-400,resizemode-4/123414265.jpg"

Maryam Riaz Wattoo, sister of former Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan ’s wife Bushra Bibi, has alleged that Bushra was forced to go on a hunger strike in prison before she was allowed to meet her family, ARY News reported.Both Bushra and Imran are behind bars facing multiple cases of corruption. Since his arrest in 2023, Khan has consistently maintained his innocence, asserting that the charges were fabricated by his opponents to prevent his political comeback.Maryam further claimed that Bushra was being kept in “difficult and unlawful” conditions. She said the ceiling of her cell leaked, the electric board had live current, rats moved around inside, and electricity was cut for up to two days.Speaking on ARY News, Maryam said Bushra was allowed to meet her family only after more than a month of repeated appeals. She said the family was also made to wait outside the jail for hours.Maryam alleged that Bushra’s health has worsened. “She has lost around 15 kilograms and has become very weak,” she said, adding that her sister’s morale remained strong.She also said that Bushra has not been given bail in several cases and has not been allowed to meet her husband, PTI founder Imran Khan.Meanwhile, Dawn reported that Imran Khan has nominated Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PMAP) chairman Mahmood Khan Achakzai as opposition Leader in the national assembly, and Azam Khan Swati as opposition leader in the senate.","Maryam Riaz Wattoo, sister of former Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan ’s wife Bushra Bibi, has alleged that Bushra was forced to go on a hunger strike in prison.

Rescuers in Pakistan are struggling to recover bodies after flash floods triggered by relentless monsoon rains killed at least 321 people in the past 48 hours, officials told AFP on Saturday. Most casualties were reported in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where 307 people died as rivers burst their banks and houses collapsed.A video shared by RT.com showed the scale of destruction as torrents swept through towns and villages, leaving entire neighbourhoods in ruins. The floods, described by residents as “doomsday”, have left many communities cut off with relief efforts hampered by washed-out roads and ongoing rainfall.Authorities said around 2,000 rescue workers are engaged in operations across nine districts, but access remains severely restricted.“Heavy rainfall, landslides in several areas, and washed-out roads are causing significant challenges in delivering aid, particularly in transporting heavy machinery and ambulances,” Bilal Ahmed Faizi, spokesman for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s rescue agency, told AFP.“Due to road closures in most areas, rescue workers are travelling on foot to conduct operations in remote regions,” he added.Buner district has been hardest hit, recording at least 184 deaths. Other badly affected areas include Shangla, Mansehra, Swat, Bajaur and Battagram. The provincial government has declared these mountainous districts as disaster zones.Survivors have described terrifying scenes as torrents tore through homes without warning.“I heard a loud noise as if the mountain was sliding. I rushed outside and saw the entire area shaking, like it was the end of the world,” Azizullah told AFP. “The ground was trembling due to the force of the water, and it felt like death was staring me in the face.”Mass funerals were held across affected districts on Friday, with mourners grieving in front of rows of bodies covered by blankets. Local schoolteacher Saifullah Khan said: “We still have no clear idea who in this small village is alive and who is dead. I help retrieve the bodies of the children I taught, I keep wondering what kind of trial nature has imposed on these kids.”Officials warned the death toll is likely to rise further as dozens remain missing. Pakistan’s meteorological department has issued more rain alerts, warning that the intensity of the monsoon will worsen over the next two weeks.","Floods triggered by relentless monsoon rains have killed at least 321 people in Pakistan.

ISLAMABAD: The foreign ministers of Afghanistan, China and Pakistan on Wednesday agreed to expand their cooperation in multiple fields, including extension of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ) to Kabul.Pakistan Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Afghanistan acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi took part in the 6th Trilateral Foreign Ministers Dialogue in Kabul which focused on political, economic and security cooperation.The agreement on extension of the multi-billion dollars CPEC comes as Islamabad and Beijing are expected to launch the second phase of the project later this month during Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's visit to China to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit.Pakistan's Foreign Office in a brief statement on X said that the three sides ""committed to strengthen joint efforts against terrorism"".""They also reaffirmed their commitment to deepening collaboration in trade, transit, regional development, health, education, culture, and combating drug trafficking, as well as, extension of CPEC to Afghanistan,"" it said.This is the first visit by the Chinese foreign minister to Afghanistan since the Taliban stormed to power in 2021 while the third by Dar to the Afghan capital since April.According to sources, China has played a role in easing tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan.In a bilateral meeting with his Afghanistan counterpart, Pakistan's foreign minister claimed there was an ""increase in terrorist attacks"" in his country by terrorist outfits operating from Afghanistan, the Foreign Office said.In the last trilateral meeting in May in Beijing, the foreign ministers of the three countries had first agreed to expand the CPEC to Afghanistan to boost ""trilateral"" cooperation.India has been severely critical of the CPEC as it passes through Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir.

At least 76 people were killed, including 17 children, in western Afghanistan after a bus carrying refugees collided with a truck and motorcycle and caught fire, according to provincial government spokesman Ahmadullah Muttaqi and local police.According to a news report from Al Jazeera, police said that the accident occurred due to the excessive speed and negligence of the bus. The bus route to Kabul was carrying refugees who were recently deported from Iran, according to provincial official Mohammad Yousuf Saeedi.They were part of a massive wave of Afghans who were deported from Iran recently.Earlier, Iranian minister of interior Eskandar Momeni announced that around 800,000 people would be deported by March.Saeedi said that all the passengers boarded the bus at a border crossing point, Islam Qala.Three passengers survived the accident after the bus collided with a motorcycle first and then hit the truck, which was carrying fuel. The collision was so strong that it led to the eruption of fire.Two people in the truck and another two on the motorcycle were among the deceased.","At least 76 people were killed, including 17 children, in western Afghanistan.

Climate crisis drives displacement





After decades of war, Afghanistan is moving to assert sovereignty over its water resources, a shift that is testing fragile ties with neighbouring countries.Since taking power in 2021, the Taliban have launched large-scale infrastructure projects, including dams and canals, to harness river flows that spill into Iran, Pakistan, and Central Asia.But as per news agency AFP, these efforts are fuelling disputes, with climate change worsening water shortages across the region.The most contentious initiative is the Qosh Tepa canal, a mega-project designed to irrigate 560,000 hectares of farmland in northern Afghanistan. Experts say it could divert up to 21 per cent of the Amu Darya’s flow, a river already vital for water-stressed Central Asian states. Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, backed by Kazakhstan, have raised alarms that the project could further shrink the Aral Sea and destabilise the region’s water-sharing arrangements, which date back to the Soviet era.Water governance specialist Mohd Faizee cautioned and was quoted by AFP as saying, “No matter how friendly the tone is now, at some point there will be consequences for Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan when the canal starts operating.”Taliban officials, however, insist the canal will not cause significant harm. Project manager Sayed Zabihullah Miri was cited by AFP as saying that the Amu Darya has “an abundance of water, especially when it floods and glacial meltwater flows into it”.They argue the project is critical to boosting food security in a country where climate-driven crop failures and humanitarian crises remain widespread.Iran, Afghanistan’s western neighbour, is the only country with a formal water-sharing treaty, signed in 1973 over the Helmand river. But the accord has never been fully honoured. Tehran frequently accuses Kabul of restricting flows through upstream dams, especially during droughts.The Taliban maintain that water scarcity, worsened by climate change, leaves them unable to release more.A report by the Afghanistan Analysts Network noted that Afghan authorities also believe they have long been denied their fair share of Helmand waters due to poor management and political neglect.Meanwhile, disputes also simmer over the Harirud basin, which flows into Iran and Turkmenistan, where Afghanistan recently inaugurated the Pashdan dam. Analysts say reduced security risks after the war could accelerate such projects, reshaping regional water dynamics.To the east, Afghanistan shares the Kabul river basin with Pakistan, which eventually feeds into the Indus. Unlike Iran, no treaty exists between the two neighbours. While water disputes have not dominated their rocky bilateral relations, Kabul’s attempts to revive old river projects and build new ones could trigger friction.Yet, Afghanistan’s financial struggles and lack of technical expertise mean most large-scale projects will take years to complete. This delay may ease immediate diplomatic concerns, but for Afghans grappling with severe water shortages in the capital and beyond, the wait could deepen suffering.Afghanistan’s water disputes cannot be separated from the worsening climate emergency. According to the UN’s International Organisation for Migration (IOM), nearly five million people were affected by floods, droughts, and other climate shocks in early 2025, with almost 400,000 displaced.“Crop failure, dry pastures and vanishing water sources are pushing rural communities to the edge,” the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation warned in July.Villagers in the north were quoted by AFP as saying that they were pinning hopes on the Qosh Tepa canal to revive farming, though its completion is still more than a year away. In contrast, communities in western Herat have watched the Harirud river run dry, forcing families who were deported from Iran to return to barren land with little to farm.Meanwhile, extreme rainfall has added another layer of crisis. Warmer temperatures mean heavier downpours, often triggering devastating flash floods. In Maidan Wardak, a community leader said, “I’m around 54 years old, and we have never experienced problems like this before.”Taliban officials admit their efforts fall short. Energy and water minister Abdul Latif Mansoor recently conceded that while canal and dam projects are underway, “the measures we have taken so far are not enough”.Limited funding, international isolation and restrictive governance have left Afghanistan struggling to cope with climate shocks, even as it faces one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises.For millions of Afghans, everything now comes down to water, too little in times of drought, too much during floods, as the Taliban’s push for control over rivers becomes a defining issue for the country and its neighbours alike.","Afghanistan is moving to assert sovereignty over its water resources, a shift that is testing fragile ties with neighbouring countries.

A United Nations-backed investigator has revealed disturbing evidence of “systemic torture” inside Myanmar’s detention centres, describing electric shocks, strangulations, gang rape and the burning of sexual body parts among the abuses that were documented over the past year.Nicholas Koumjian, head of the international independent team investigating atrocities in the country, spoke as the group released its latest annual report on Tuesday, covering the 12 months to 30 June.The country has been in turmoil since February 2021, ever since the army overthrew Aung San Suu Kyi’s elected government, sparking a civil war. As peaceful protests were crushed with lethal force, those opposing military rule took up arms.Since then, conflict has engulfed large parts of Myanmar.The investigative team, as quoted by AP, said that it had made progress in identifying security personnel involved in detention operations, as well as “perpetrators who have summarily executed captured combatants or civilians accused of being informers.”These perpetrators included members of the security forces, affiliated militias and opposition armed groups.The report details the ""documented torture in Myanmar’s detention facilities which includes beatings, electric shocks, strangulations, gang rape, burning of sexual body parts and other forms of sexual violence,"" according to a summary of the findings.“Our report highlights a continued increase in the frequency and brutality of atrocities committed in Myanmar,” Koumjian said. “We are working towards the day when the perpetrators will have to answer for their actions in a court of law.”“We have uncovered significant evidence, including eyewitness testimony, showing systematic torture in Myanmar detention facilities,” he further added.The team also launched new investigations into atrocities committed in Rakhine state, where the military and the Arakan Army, an opposition force, are battling for control.Rakhine has long been the scene of grave abuses. More than 700,000 people from the Rohingya minority fled to neighbouring Bangladesh in 2017 to escape persecution. About 70,000 more crossed the border last year after the Arakan Army effectively seized control of the territory.The Independent Investigative Mechanism on Myanmar has been operating since 2018 under a mandate from the UN-backed Human Rights Council to document human rights abuses and violations in the country.It has already shared evidence with authorities pursuing cases involving the Rohingya at the International Criminal Court and the UN’s International Court of Justice.","U.N.-backed team releases annual report covering the 12 months to 30 June.

Three Thai soldiers were injured in a landmine explosion on Saturday while patrolling near the Cambodian border, just days after the two countries agreed to extend a fragile ceasefire following their deadliest clashes in decades.The blast took place in Sisaket province at around 10 AM local time (0300 GMT), the Royal Thai Military said in a statement. One soldier sustained a severe leg injury, another suffered wounds to his back and arm, while the third experienced serious ear damage from the blast’s pressure.Tensions have been high since last month’s five-day conflict over disputed ancient temples along the 800-kilometre (500-mile) border, which left at least 43 people dead and forced more than 300,000 residents from their homes.

This is so because the seismic waves from shallow earthquakes have a shorter distance to travel to the surface, resulting in stronger ground shaking causing more damage to structures and greater casualties.According to the Red Cross, Afghanistan lies on several fault lines between the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates, particularly in the Hindu Kush mountain region, making it one of the most earthquake-prone areas in the world.The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA), Afghanistan warn that frequent quakes continue to pose a serious threat to communities in the country, which are already vulnerable due to decades of conflict and underdevelopment.The organization also noted that the country is highly vulnerable to natural disasters, including seasonal flooding, landslides and earthquakes.","An earthquake of 4.4 magnitude struck Afghanistan on Wednesday. The quake occurred at a depth of 155 kilometers. The epicenter was located at latitude 36.51°N and longitude 70.70°E. This was the second quake recorded today, as seismic activity continues to affect the region.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123140011,imgsize-727677,width-400,resizemode-4/123140011.jpg"

Bangladesh Interim Chief Yunus To Stay After Resignation Threat Amid Protests Over Rohingya Corridor

July Declaration unveiled:

Tight security and public celebration:





Bangladesh’s interim chief adviser and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus on Tuesday announced that the country’s next general elections will be held in February 2026, ahead of the holy month of Ramadan. He made the declaration during his address to the nation via state television, BTV and radio to mark the first anniversary of the mass uprising that ousted former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina ""On behalf of the interim government, I will write to the Chief Election Commissioner, requesting that the Election Commission organise a national election in February 2026, before the next Ramadan,"" Yunus said.The announcement marks a shift from his earlier indication that polls would be held in April. The revised timeline comes after consultations with major political parties, including the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) headed by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia which had called for earlier elections.""We will all begin mental preparation and institutional arrangements from tomorrow to complete all arrangements so that this year's election is memorable in the country's history in terms of joy and celebration, peace and order, voter turnout, and cordiality,"" he added.Yunus urged political parties to ensure that youth and women are not excluded from their manifestos or future governance plans. ""Remember, the youth who have changed Bangladesh have the power to change the world as well,"" he said.Earlier today, the interim government had also formally released the ""July Declaration"", a 26-point document outlining proposed reforms in governance, constitutional and political issues.Top leaders from political groups such as the BNP, Jamaat-e-Islami, and the newly formed National Citizen Party (NCP) were present during the official unveiling at the Bangladesh Parliament Complex, commemorating the uprising anniversary.The declaration sharply criticized the 1972 Constitution after its independence war against Pakistan in 1971, calling for reforms aligned with the will of the people.""Whereas, the post-independence Awami League government failed to materialise the people's aspirations because of the weaknesses in the procedures of drafting and in the structure of the constitution, along with its inappropriate application,"" the July Declaration said.It also condemned Sheikh Hasina’s administration, accusing it of turning Bangladesh into a fascist, mafia and failed state through alleged authoritarian rule and human rights violations.""Whereas, during the rule of Sheikh Hasina, under her very leadership, an extreme force that was anti-people, autocratic and against human rights turned Bangladesh into a fascist, mafia and failed state and thereby tarnished Bangladesh's international image,"" it added.The document calls for the 2024 uprising to be given official recognition and proposes that the July Declaration be included in a reformed constitution.Tens of thousands gathered at Manik Mia Avenue in Dhaka to mark the anniversary of Hasina’s ouster. The government declared the day a national holiday. Security was heightened across the capital, with police checkpoints and patrols in sensitive areas.Sheikh Hasina, who had been in power for 15 years, fled to India in August last year following mass protests. Her party, the Awami League, has since been banned by the interim administration, and its registration has been revoked by the Election Commission, effectively barring it from contesting in future polls unless the ban is lifted.Meanwhile, Human Rights Watch (HRW) raised concerns over the interim government's progress on human rights.""The hope of the thousands who braved lethal violence a year ago when they opposed Sheikh Hasina's abusive rule to build a rights-respecting democracy remains unfulfilled,"" said Meenakshi Ganguly, deputy Asia director at HRW.She warned that the interim leadership is struggling to balance security reform with pressures from hardliners and rival political factions.As the nation reflects on the events of the past year, Bangladesh remains on high alert. The month of August also marks the anniversary of the 1975 assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the country’s founding figure and Hasina’s father.","Bangladesh's interim chief adviser and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus announced that the country’s next general elections will be held in February 2026.

Protests mark Hasina’s exit anniversary: Student-led party rallies in Dhaka; calls for new constitution,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/protests-mark-hasinas-exit-anniversary-student-led-party-rallies-in-dhaka-calls-for-new-constitution/articleshow/123078902.cms,"Protesters on the streets of Dhaka (AP)





A newly formed political party led by students who played a key role in the anti-government protests that led to the ouster of former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina held a rally in the country's capital Dhaka on Sunday, pledging to build a new Bangladesh amid ongoing political uncertainty surrounding the next national election, reported news agency AP.The National Citizen Party, formed by the organisers of last year’s protests, gathered near the Shaheed Minar monument with around 1,000 supporters. Party leader Nahid Islam announced a 24-point agenda and called for the creation of a new constitution to replace the one adopted in 1972.“Exactly one year ago, at this Shaheed Minar (memorial), we vowed to free this country from the hands of dictatorship. By responding to that call, we together defeated the fascist rule and regained control of our country,” Islam said.“Let us all unite and transform this historic 24-point agenda into reality to build a new Bangladesh, a Bangladesh that fulfills the dreams of all citizens, as we move toward the formation of our second republic,” he added, as quoted by the agency.The party did not provide specific details on the proposed constitution but said its goal was to reflect the aspirations of a new generation of Bangladeshis.Separately, the student wing of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) also held a large rally in Dhaka.BNP acting chairman Tarique Rahman, who has been in exile in London since 2008, addressed the crowd virtually and urged supporters to mobilise young voters ahead of the upcoming polls, according to AP.Rahman said, “We must reclaim our democratic rights and engage the youth in shaping Bangladesh’s future.”The rallies took place two days before the interim government, led by Nobel peace prize laureate Muhammad Yunus is set to mark the first anniversary of Sheikh Hasina’s departure from power.Hasina fled to India on August 5, 2024, following weeks of mass protests and political unrest that resulted in hundreds of deaths and thousands of injuries. Yunus assumed office on August 8.The demonstrations come amid criticism of the interim government’s handling of law and order, with opposition parties accusing it of failing to contain mob violence and uphold human rights.With Hasina’s Awami League banned and the political future still unclear, the rallies highlighted the growing activity among both new and established political forces ahead of the next election.","National Citizen Party, formed by the organisers of last year’s protests, gathered near the Shaheed Minar monument with around 1,000 supporters.

Key points at a glance

Move to Forest Lodge planned for later this year (property not officially confirmed).

Eight bedrooms, Georgian era, private setting in Windsor Great Park (tennis court, period interiors).

Long-term base: reports suggest they intend to remain there even when William is king.

Funding: rent and renovations to be covered privately.

Other homes: Kensington Palace (work) and Anmer Hall (weekends) remain in use.

Note: There has been no formal public announcement naming Forest Lodge as the future royal residence once William is king. The picture above reflects consistent reporting across multiple outlets and the confirmed plan to move house this year.





Prince William and Kate Middleton plan to move into Forest Lodge in Windsor Great Park later this year. Reports suggest the family intend to keep it as their main home even when William becomes king. There’s no official confirmation of the specific property; Palace aides have only said the Wales family will move house later this year.Forest Lodge is an eight-bedroom Georgian house with the privacy and space the family has not had at Adelaide Cottage. Photos and records show period details inside and a tennis court on the grounds, with a quiet, wooded setting inside the park. People’s interiors coverage has highlighted archived images—fireplaces, Venetian windows and detailed ceilings—from an early-2000s shoot that give a sense of the house’s character.A move before Christmas remains the working assumption if refurbishment keeps pace. Reporting points to a handover before year’s end, but the timing will depend on the house being ready.The choice fits how they live now. The children attend school near Windsor, and Eton College is close for Prince George when the time comes. Staying based in the park keeps school runs simple and daily life steady.There is also a clean-slate feel. The past stretch has been difficult for the wider family.A move to a larger home in the same area offers routine without fresh upheaval.Forest Lodge would mark a shift from old habits. The monarch has long been linked to Buckingham Palace as a primary base. The plan here is different: Prince William and Kate Middleton are expected to keep using London and other palaces for work, while home life stays in Windsor. Ongoing renovation work at Buckingham Palace adds a practical reason to keep the family settled where they are.Money matters appear straightforward. Coverage says the couple will fund rent and current renovations privately, drawing on William’s income from the Duchy of Cornwall. The goal is a family home first, with formal spaces available when needed.They will still hold on to other places. Kensington Palace remains their London base for duties. Anmer Hall in Norfolk stays as a country retreat. Forest Lodge would sit at the center of that small triangle.Practical details are still emerging. Reports describe a preference for limited live-in staff and separate quarters for their longtime nanny—consistent with the low-key way they have run the household in recent years. The property is large enough to place security and help at a distance from family rooms.The move is not yet complete. Work on the house continues, and any relocation would also require arrangements typical for residences on Crown land. The family will make the switch when it is ready. If the plan holds, Forest Lodge becomes the anchor now and in the future, while official palaces remain the stage for state work. The idea is simple: keep the children’s routines intact and handle the Crown’s business where it belongs.",Prince William and Kate Middleton plan to move into Forest Lodge in Windsor Great Park later this year.

Britain agrees to drop mandate for Apple to provide 'back door',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/britain-agrees-to-drop-mandate-for-apple-to-provide-back-door/articleshow/123395824.cms,"Representative Image





SAN FRANCISCO: The Trump administration has reached an agreement with Britain to spare Apple from a request that the company create a tool to give British law enforcement organisations access to customers' cloud data.Tulsi Gabbard, US director of national intelligence, said Monday night that Britain had ""agreed to drop its mandate for Apple to provide a 'back door' that would have enabled access to the protected encrypted data of American citizens and encroached on our civil liberties.""Britain's decision to back off the policy comes after Apple spent months lobbying officials in Washington and rolled back an encrypted storage feature for British users. In the face of govt pressure around the world, the company has been resolute that it won't create a back door that allows access to phones or encrypted user data because it is afraid such a tool could be abused.Much of Apple's predicament in Britain played out in private after the govt issued a secret order this year. The request came after Britain amended its Investigatory Powers Act of 2016, which allows it to compel companies to turn over data and communications to law enforcement and intelligence agencies.Apple helped make the secret order public by declaring in Feb that iPhone users in Britain would begin seeing messages on their phones saying the company no longer offered its Advanced Data Protection feature. The capability, which remained available in the US, had allowed British users to encrypt almost all of their iCloud data, including messages,notes, photos and backups.Gabbard said Britain's agreement would ""ensure Americans' private data remains private and our Constitutional rights and civil liberties are protected."" nyt",Britain dropped a request for Apple to create a tool to give law enforcement access to customers' cloud data.

Royal Navy gets its first Hindu chaplain,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/royal-navy-gets-its-first-hindu-chaplain/articleshow/123394957.cms,"The UK's Royal Navy has appointed Bhanu Attri as its first-ever Hindu chaplain. (PTI Photo)





LONDON: A pandit raised in India has become the Royal Navy’s first ever Hindu chaplain.Bhanu Attri (39), who grew up in Himachal Pradesh but now lives in Essex, formally passed out of Britannia Royal Naval College in Dartmouth last week and is also the Royal Navy’s first non-Christian chaplain.He was one of two chaplains and 148 new Royal Navy officers to pass out.Chaplains offer religious, pastoral, welfare and moral support to any member of the naval service, regardless of faith, who need it either at a base, or on ships and submarines. Attri, a Hindu priest with decades of experience running a Hindu temple in London, will also offer Hindu prayer ceremonies for Hindus.There are around 40 Hindu personnel serving full-time in the Royal Navy, plus another 30 in the Maritime Reserves. In the UK military, as a whole, there are more than 1,550 Hindus serving full-time, mostly in the army.Whilst most cadets underwent 29 weeks of training, he underwent a slightly different 13-week course: six weeks of officer instruction, which included learning about the Royal Navy’s worldwide role, its present-day mission, and how to survive a sinking ship; four weeks at sea, and three weeks focused on the role of a military chaplain.Bhanu will now join the chaplaincy at HMS Drake, serving the thousands of personnel working in and around Devonport Naval Base, ashore and at sea.“Passing out from Britannia Royal Naval College to become the first ever Hindu chaplain in the fleet is a profound honour,” Attri said. “The chance to represent individuals from other diverse religions brings meaningful representation for the Hindu community and reflects the Navy’s commitment to diversity, inclusion, and spiritual care for all. My family feels immense pride.”Anil Bhanot, Hindu adviser to the ministry of defence (MoD), said: “In 2023 the Royal Navy created a position for a Hindu chaplain and I endorsed Pandit Bhanu Prakash Attri for best fitting the criteria. He has qualifications from India equivalent to a Sanskrit scriptural postgraduate degree.” Bhanot said he wanted to encourage more Hindu youth to join the British armed forces.“Although our spiritual Bhoomi is India, our Karma-Bhoomi is the UK and MoD represents our protective arm,” he said.","Bhanu Attri (39), who grew up in Himachal Pradesh but now lives in Essex, formally passed out of Britannia Royal Naval College in Dartmouth last week.

LONDON: A man has been convicted of causing grievous bodily harm with intent for his role in the shooting of a nine-year-old Keralite girl when she was eating ice-cream with her family in a restaurant in Dalston.The girl was hit in the head by the first of six bullets fired from a passing stolen motorcycle at a Turkish restaurant at 9.20 pm on May 29, 2024. She was caught up in a gangland shooting.Javon Riley (33) of Tottenham, London, was also found guilty by a jury at the Old Bailey of attempting to murder three men — Mustafa Kiziltan (35) Kenan Aydogdu (45) and Nasser Ali (44) — who were sitting outside Evin Restaurant. The three men were the intended targets. All four were taken to hospital for emergency surgery.The men had affiliations with Hackney Turks and the shooting was ordered by the Tottenham Turks, a rival gang, the court heard. Both gangs are responsible for importing most of the UK’s heroin.The girl has been left permanently injured with a titanium plate in her skull and a bullet still in her brain. She was in hospital for three months and will continue to have physical and cognitive difficulties throughout her life.Her parents hail from Kerala’s Ernakulam district and moved to Birmingham three years ago for work. Following the verdict her mother said: “This was not just an accident — even if our daughter was not the intended target, those responsible were still attempting to take lives, it is brutal and inhumane. We live with this pain every day, knowing nothing will ever be the same for our family.”Riley denied the charges but was convicted on Monday following a three-week trial. He did not pull the trigger but scoped out the area over several days, which included drinking pina coladas at the bar opposite. On the night of the attack, he travelled past the scene several times in a stolen car to ensure the targets were present and helped the gunman evade capture. The gunman and firearm have never been found. Detectives are offering up to £15,000 (Rs 17 lakh) for information that leads to the gunman. Riley, who is not a member of Tottenham Turks, refused to name the gunman or the person who ordered the shooting fearing for his safety.He will be sentenced on Sep 12.","Javon Riley (33) of Tottenham, London, was also found guilty by a jury at the Old Bailey of attempting to murder three men.

"‘Crushing cost’: UK parents skip meals, forego heating to afford school uniforms",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/crushing-cost-uk-parents-skip-meals-forego-heating-to-afford-school-uniforms-survey/articleshow/123384048.cms,"Representative AI image





A survey has found that parents in England are skipping meals and relying on buy-now-pay-later services like Klarna to cover the cost of school uniforms ahead of the autumn term.The survey, conducted by parenting charity Parentkind, found that many parents were being pushed into debt to afford school uniforms. Nearly half (45 percent) of respondents said they planned to use credit cards, while a third (34 percent) expected to rely on services such as Klarna.Of the 2,000 parents surveyed, nearly half (47 percent) expressed concern over the high cost of school uniforms, often running into hundreds of pounds for branded items. More than a quarter (29 percent) reported skipping food or heating to meet the cost.Education secretary Bridget Phillipson has called on schools to urgently ease the burden on struggling parents by cutting back on mandatory branded uniform items, ahead of an upcoming change in the law.“School uniform matters, but it shouldn’t break the bank. No family should have to choose between putting food on the table and buying a new blazer,” said Bridget Phillipson as quoted by the Guardian.“Parents have told us they want fewer costly branded items, and that’s exactly what we’re delivering. Schools can help ease the pressure on families right now by reducing the number of branded items they require.” Philllipson added.From September 2026, schools in the UK will be limited to three branded items, plus a branded tie for secondary and middle schools, under the government’s Children and Schools Bill. However, Phillipson has urged parents to adopt the changes earlier on a voluntary basis.The new legislation will allow parents to purchase basic uniform items, such as shirts and trousers, from general retailers like Aldi and Marks and Spencer.At present, schools can require parents to purchase multiple logo-branded items from specialist suppliers, with some demanding more than five, and in certain cases up to 10, pushing total uniform costs to as much as £400 when PE kits are included.“Parents have faced the crushing cost of sending their children to school for far too long. For many families the bills soar into the thousands every year, covering uniforms, books, stationery, trips, laptops and travel. These reforms are the first real step towards ending that injustice,” Parentkind’s chief executive Jason Elsom was quoted as saying by the Guardian.“Limiting branded school uniform items will make a difference straight away. Our research shows 85% of parents believe this will cut costs, 71% prefer to buy plain items and add the logo later, and 83% say unbranded uniform is just as good quality. This is about keeping money in parents’ pockets without sacrificing school pride,” Elsom said.Almost 9 in 10 parents (86 percent) of children aged between 4 to 15 in state schools in England said branded uniforms made no difference to a student’s behavior, as per the survey conducted.",Parents in England are skipping meals and relying on buy-now-pay-later services like Klarna to cover the cost of school uniforms.

Iowa Senator Joni Ernst defended her controversial statement ""we all are going to die,"" at a town hall meeting and said that ""you need to listen to the entire conversation.""Speaking to CBS News on Monday, Ernst said, ""I'm very compassionate, and you need to listen to the entire conversation.""During a heated town hall on Friday, Senator Joni Ernst sparked viral attention with remarks about mortality as she defended a controversial GOP-backed domestic policy bill. The legislation, dubbed the One Big Beautiful Bill act—a nod to former President Trump's nickname for it—seeks to implement work requirements for certain Medicaid recipients, among other reforms.Tensions rose when Ernst attempted to explain the proposed changes to Medicaid, prompting someone in the crowd to shout that the policy would lead to deaths.Ernst elaborated that the legislation would ""focus on those that are most vulnerable"" and assured that ""those that meet the eligibility requirements for Medicaid we will protect.""Subsequently, Ernst posted an ironic video apology on Instagram, stating, ""I made an incorrect assumption that everyone in the auditorium understood that, yes, we are all going to perish from this Earth. So, I apologize. I'm really, really glad that I did not have to bring up the subject of the Tooth Fairy as well.""Her remarks drew criticism from potential electoral challengers. Democratic nominee candidate Nathan Sage accused Ernst of showing contempt for constituents, whilst State Representative JD Scholten announced his campaign launch, citing Ernst's town hall behaviour as motivation.The House legislation would implement additional Medicaid restrictions, including requirements for non-disabled adults without children to work, volunteer or study. It also introduces more frequent eligibility assessments, reduces funding for states covering undocumented immigrants, freezes provider taxes and prohibits gender transition service coverage.The proposed modifications to Medicaid and SNAP could generate substantial savings, potentially funding extensions of Trump's 2017 tax cuts and enhanced border security measures.Ernst acknowledged at the town hall that whilst she supports certain aspects of the House-passed legislation, ""the bill will be changing"" as it progresses through the Senate, where some Republicans advocate for reduced Medicaid cuts.","Iowa Senator Joni Ernst defended her controversial statement ""we all are going to die,"" at a town hall meeting and said that ""you need to listen to the entire conversation"" The legislation, dubbed the One Big Beautiful Bill act, seeks to implement work requirements for certain Medicaid recipients.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121586033,imgsize-45878,width-400,resizemode-4/121586033.jpg"
Trump shuts down proposal to allow Iran's civilian nuclear enrichment,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-shuts-down-proposal-to-allow-irans-civilian-nuclear-enrichment/articleshow/121583529.cms,"US President Donald Trump

Trump Allows Iran Limited Nuclear Uranium Enrichment Under New Proposal - Axios





US President Donald Trump on Monday seems to have rejected a proposal from his special envoy to Iran that would have allowed Tehran to retain low-level uranium enrichment for civilian purposes. Trump insisted that any deal to ease US sanctions must require Iran to fully dismantle its nuclear enrichment program.“Under our potential Agreement — WE WILL NOT ALLOW ANY ENRICHMENT OF URANIUM!” Trump posted on social media but there is no clarification whether he was talking about the proposal or not.Trump’s stance appeared to contradict recent efforts by his envoy, Steve Witkoff, who had reportedly offered Iran the option to continue limited enrichment for uses like nuclear medicine and power, in exchange for shutting down its heavily fortified underground sites.The proposal also included a regional consortium to oversee civilian uranium enrichment, a concept dating back to negotiations around the 2015 Iran nuclear deal.Tehran has denied it is seeking nuclear weapons but has refused to consider any deal that completely ends its enrichment activities. The US and Iran have recently held several rounds of direct nuclear talks, the first in years, as Trump has framed a deal as the best way to avoid military conflict.The latest proposal reportedly included significant concessions that could provoke strong opposition from Israel and pro-Israel lawmakers in Washington. Trump had sharply criticized the 2015 nuclear agreement and withdrew the US from it in 2017 during his first term.",US President Donald Trump seems to have rejected a proposal from his special envoy to Iran.

'You're killing my people so I kill you': Witness recounts Colorado attacker Mohamed Sabry Soliman shouted before setting fire,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/youre-killing-my-people-so-i-kill-you-witness-says-colorado-attacker-mohamed-sabry-soliman-shouted-before-setting-fire/articleshow/121576613.cms,"Mohamed Sabry Soliman took off his vest when they started to catch the fire.

Row over Mohamed Sabry Soliman's identity







A witness who saw Colorado terrorist attack suspect Mohamed Sabry Soliman up close during when he targeted a Jewish crowd told CNN that Soliman was singling people out and called them 'killer'. ""F**k you zionsist. You're killing my people so I kill you,"" Soliman said, as eyewitness Brian Horowitz told CNN.Horowitz said the attacker then locked eyes with him. ""That’s when he looked at me and said you’re a killer,"" Horowitz said. The man used a flamethrower and lobbed Molotov cocktails but no one died from the attack. Eight victims — four men and four women between the ages of 52 and 88 — were transported to nearby hospitals for treatment.A major row broke out after Soliman, an Egyptian, was initially called a white man in some news channels before he was identified as an Egyptian who has been overstaying his visa. Republicans slammed Democrats for referring to Soliman as a 'Colorado man' while Donald Trump's aide Laura Loomer said the GOP is also not addressing the actual issue and calling him an illegal immigrant but not an 'Islamic terrorist'.Loomer said Soliman's daughter just graduated high school as class of 2025 and has been accepted to both the University of Colorado Colorado Springs and Colorado University in Denver. ""She must not be allowed to remain in the US to attend university on US soil since her father is an Islamic terrorist,"" Loomer said, adding that she came to the US from Kuwait two years ago""Notice how the GOP narrative around Mohamed Soliman is that he is an 'illegal alien'.Barely any of them are calling him an Islamic terrorist. He likely left Egypt because they crack down on the Muslim Brotherhood there. As a supporter of the Palestinian movement, Soliman is obviously a Muslim Brotherhood terrorist,"" Loomer said, calling Mohammed the most dangerous name in the world.Soliman arrived in the area of the incident around 1pm and lingered there for some time. Soliman was wearing a utility vest over his shirt and was carrying a garden sprayer which was filled with gasoline. People thought he was a gardener. Witnesses said that Soliman took off his vest and shirt because they had started to catch fire during the attack. Soliman was taken to an area hospital after his arrest for burns he sustained to his hands during the attack.","Mohamed Sabry Soliman targeted a Jewish crowd with a flamethrower and lobbed Molotov cocktails but no one died from the attack.

US special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, dismissed Hamas' response to a proposed ceasefire deal with Israel, calling it ""totally unacceptable"" and saying it ""only takes us backward. ""In a post on X, Witkoff said,""I received the Hamas response to the United States' proposal. It is totally unacceptable and only takes us backward.

The group confirmed it would release the hostages as part of the deal.Witkoff said that the only path forward was for Hamas to accept the current proposal, backed by the US and approved by Israel so that negotiations could begin.""That is the only way we can close a 60-day ceasefire deal in the coming days in which half of the living hostages and half of those who are deceased will come home to their families and in which we can have at the proximity talks substantive negotiations in good-faith to try to reach a permanent ceasefire,"" he added in his post.The US proposal calls for negotiations about a permanent ceasefire to begin immediately on the first day of the 60-day truce.

The US Coast Guard intercepted a 25-foot sailboat carrying 16 Mexican nationals off the coast of California on Saturday and handed them over to border patrol, the agency said.The overcrowded boat was first spotted by a Coast Guard lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft about 54 miles off the coast of Point Loma near San Diego. A cutter was dispatched and the vessel, Petrel, stopped the sailboat and took the migrants into custody, according to a Coast Guard press release issued Sunday.All of those on board said they were from Mexico.The Coast Guard has increased efforts to intercept migrant vessels following US President Donald Trump ’s promise to deport illegal immigrants in the US.This latest interception comes after similar incidents in recent months. Earlier this month, a “panga-style” boat carrying Russian nationals and migrants from the Dominican Republic was stopped about three miles off the coast of Puerto Rico.In February, a 30-foot sailboat packed with 132 Haitian migrants, including women and children, was intercepted about 50 miles off the Florida coast.One of the largest recent interceptions happened last year, when over 300 Haitian migrants were stopped near the Bahamas and sent back home.","The US Coast Guard intercepted a 25-foot sailboat carrying 16 Mexican nationals off the coast of California on Saturday.

MILWAUKEE: A Wisconsin man is facing charges accusing him of forging a letter threatening President Donald Trump's life in an effort to get another man deported.Prosecutors said in a criminal complaint filed Monday that Demetric D. Scott was behind a letter sent to state and federal officials with the return address and name of Ramón Morales Reyes.Scott was charged Monday with felony witness intimidation, identity theft and two counts of bail jumping. His attorney, Robert Hampton III, didn't immediately return an email from The Associated Press seeking comment.Immigration agents arrested Morales Reyes, 54, on May 21 after he dropped his child off at school in Milwaukee. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced the arrest, saying he had written a letter threatening to kill Trump and would ""self-deport"" to Mexico. The announcement, which also was posted by the White House on its social media accounts, contained an image of the letter as well as a photo of Morales Reyes.But the claim started to unravel as investigators talked to Morales Reyes, who doesn't speak English fluently, and obtained a handwriting sample from him that was different than the handwriting in the letters, according to court documents.Morales Reyes is listed as a victim in the case involving Scott, who is awaiting trial in Milwaukee County Jail on armed robbery and aggravated battery charges. The trial is scheduled for July.Law enforcement officers listened to several calls Scott made from the jail in which he talked about letters that needed to be mailed and a plan to get someone picked up by ICE so Scott's trial could get dismissed, according to the criminal complaint. He also admitted to police that he wrote the letters, documents said.Morales Reyes works as a dishwasher in Milwaukee, where he lives with his wife and three children. He had recently applied for a U visa, which is for people in the country illegally who become victims of serious crimes, said attorney Kime Abduli, who filed that application.Abduli told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel on Monday that she was glad Morales Reyes was being cleared of any involvement in the letter writing.His deportation defence lawyer, Cain Oulahan, wrote in an email Monday night that the main focus now is to secure Morales Reyes' release from custody and the next step will be to pursue any relief he may qualify for in immigration court.""While he has a U visa pending, those are unfortunately backlogged for years, so we will be looking at other options to keep him here with his family, which includes his three US citizen children,"" Oulahan wrote.","Demetric D.

Could you own one?





A simple penny you’ve overlooked could be worth a life-changing amount. One rare 2001-D Lincoln cent has made waves in the numismatic world for an extraordinary reason: a minting error that combines the front of a penny with the back of a dime. This so-called “mule error” coin, produced at the Denver Mint, has sold for over $100,000 at auction. While it looks like an ordinary penny on one side, flipping it over reveals a design never meant to be there. If you have one, even in poor shape, it could still be worth tens of thousands.The 2001-D Lincoln cent mule error is a result of a rare mistake at the Denver Mint. While the front (obverse) of the coin features the usual portrait of Abraham Lincoln, the reverse side is where things take a surprising turn: instead of the Lincoln Memorial, it shows the reverse of a Roosevelt dime. This unexpected pairing of obverse and reverse designs is called a ""mule"" error—an accidental blend of two different coins.Only a handful of these coins are known to exist, making them incredibly rare. Experts believe fewer than 10 may have ever entered circulation. Because of this rarity, they’ve become highly valuable in the collector market. Even damaged or worn versions of this coin could sell for $20,000 or more.Four of these rare coins have already made headlines with their auction results:These figures reflect the coin’s growing demand and scarcity, especially among error coin collectors.Because these coins were unintentionally released into circulation, it’s possible—though extremely unlikely—that one could still be found in everyday pocket change. The key is to look for a 2001 penny with a ""D"" mint mark (for Denver) on the front, and then check the reverse. If it shows the torch, olive branch, and oak branch design found on a Roosevelt dime instead of the Lincoln Memorial, you may have something special.While the odds of finding this mint error are slim, it’s a reminder of how even small mistakes can create big value in the world of numismatics. So next time you empty your wallet, take a moment to inspect your coins—you might just be holding a $100,000 treasure.","The 2001-D Lincoln cent mule error is a result of a rare mistake at the Denver Mint.

Trump amplifies another conspiracy theory: Joe Biden is a robotic clone,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-amplifies-another-conspiracy-theory-joe-biden-is-a-robotic-clone/articleshow/121579923.cms,"



WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump shared an outlandish conspiracy theory Saturday night on social media saying former President Joe Biden had been ""executed in 2020"" and replaced by a robotic clone, the latest example of the president amplifying dark, false material to his millions of followers.Trump reposted a fringe rant that another user had made on the president's social media platform, Truth Social, just after 10 p.m. Saturday. The White House did not respond to requests for comment on the post about Biden, whom Trump has targeted for criticism almost daily since the start of his second term.The president has blamed Biden for all manner of societal ills and assailed his mental acuity, including with the specious theory that Biden's aides used an autopen to enact policies and issue pardons without Biden's knowledge. (Trump has acknowledged that his administration uses the autopen system on occasion.)Trump has long had a penchant for sharing debunked or baseless theories online, but his embrace of conspiracies is not limited to social media. He has also elevated false claims inside the White House and surrounded himself with Cabinet officials promoting such theories.Last month, while sitting next to the president of South Africa in the Oval Office, Trump claimed that white South African farmers were victims of mass killings and displayed an image intended to back up his assertion; the image was actually of the conflict in eastern Congo.Trump has falsely asserted that white South Africans are victims of genocide, even though police statistics do not show that white people in the nation are any more vulnerable than other groups.Trump's first four years in the White House were filled with false or misleading statements -- according to one tally, he made 30,573 of them, or 21 a day on average -- and he repeatedly shared conspiracy theories in the lead-up to the 2024 election.A New York Times analysis of thousands of Trump's social media posts and reposts over a six-month period in 2024 found that at least 330 of them described both a false, secretive plot against Trump or the American people and a specific entity supposedly responsible for it. They included suggestions that the FBI had ordered his assassination and accusations that government officials had orchestrated the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021.Trump's repost of the robot conspiracy theory came a day after Biden told reporters that he was feeling good after beginning treatment for an aggressive form of prostate cancer. Trump has suggested that Biden's diagnosis last month was not new and had been concealed from the public.",Trump reposted a fringe rant that another user had made on the president's social media platform.

US heat alert! Why summer 2025 could be the most dangerous in decades according to NOAA,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-heat-alert-why-summer-2025-could-be-the-most-dangerous-in-decades-according-to-noaa/articleshow/121579586.cms,"US Heat Alert

US to experience coast-to-coast heatwaves, NOAA warns



The West and Southwest, including Southern California, Arizona, and Nevada

The Gulf Coast and Florida, where high humidity will exacerbate heat index values

The Northeast and New England, regions historically less prepared for extreme heat events

Which US cities will face the worst heat in 2025



1. Northeast and New England

Cities like Boston, Hartford, and New York City could experience more frequent 90°F+ days than usual. These areas lack widespread air conditioning compared to hotter climates, making heat preparedness critical.

2. The Southwest and Four Corners

This region, already accustomed to hot summers, is expected to see record-breaking high temperatures. Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Albuquerque could face days topping 115°F.

3. The Pacific Northwest

Typically known for mild summers, Seattle and Portland are under threat of multiple heat domes, similar to the deadly 2021 event. Infrastructure in these areas is still adapting to extreme heat.

4. Florida and Gulf Coast

High heat combined with tropical moisture could lead to oppressive heat indices over 110°F, creating a “wet sauna” environment. The risk of heat stroke and heat exhaustion is high.

Why cities feel like ovens: The urban heat island effect

Philadelphia is expected to exceed 40 days over 90°F, up from a historical average of 34

Chicago may experience back-to-back days above 95°F

Houston and Dallas could face “dangerously hot” periods with overnight temperatures staying above 80°F

Why heat causes more deaths than storms



Seniors over age 65

Young children

People with cardiovascular or respiratory conditions

Outdoor workers, especially in agriculture and construction

Wildfire threats: Fueling the fire season

High-risk zones in June:

Coastal Southeast

Central Texas

Four Corners region

Northern and Southern California

Later in the summer, wildfire threats could expand to:

Hawaii

The Great Basin

Southern Plains

Power grid and infrastructure challenges



Adaptation and safety measures



Personal safety tips

Stay hydrated with water, not sugary or alcoholic drinks

Avoid strenuous outdoor activity between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.

Wear light, breathable clothing

Use fans and air conditioning, or seek cooling centers

Community-level adaptations

Expanding green spaces and tree cover

Installing reflective rooftops and pavements

Establishing early warning systems for heat alerts

Subsidizing access to air conditioning for low-income households

Climate change and the bigger picture

The last 10 summers have all ranked in the top 15 warmest on record

Sea surface temperatures in the Pacific and Gulf of Mexico are near historic highs, fueling atmospheric changes

Heatwaves are lasting longer, starting earlier, and occurring more frequently





As meteorological summer officially begins on June 1, 2025, the United States is preparing for what may become one of its hottest summers in recorded history. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has issued an alarming seasonal outlook through its Climate Prediction Center (CPC), forecasting significantly above-average temperatures across nearly the entire country, as per The Economic Times report. Unlike past years that showed regional variability, the 2025 summer projection offers little reprieve anywhere in the US or even in most of Alaska. Driven by persistent atmospheric patterns, elevated sea surface temperatures, and the residual effects of climate change, this summer is shaping up to test the nation’s resilience to heat, wildfires, and health crises like never before.From densely packed urban neighborhoods to arid rural lands, the effects of this prolonged heat event are expected to ripple across infrastructure, agriculture, public health, and emergency services. Here's an in-depth look at what to expect, where the worst heat will strike, and how cities and individuals can prepare.According to NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center, model simulations show overwhelming support for a hotter-than-average summer across the continental US and much of Alaska. Areas most at risk of experiencing prolonged heat waves include:Johnna Infanti, a meteorologist with NOAA’s CPC, stated that “model guidance was overwhelmingly above normal across the US,” suggesting this forecast is one of the most confident summer projections ever released.Urban areas are uniquely vulnerable due to the urban heat island (UHI) effect—caused by concrete, asphalt, and limited green space retaining heat. According to NOAA:Lack of tree canopy, dark rooftops, and minimal airflow intensify the heat, disproportionately affecting low-income and elderly populations.Heat remains the leading weather-related cause of death in the United States, surpassing hurricanes and floods. Vulnerable populations include:Heat stroke, dehydration, and heat exhaustion are all life-threatening conditions that can escalate quickly. Emergency departments are urged to prepare for spikes in admissions during heat waves.NOAA also projects below-normal precipitation for the Northern Rockies, Northwest, and central parts of the Great Plains. As vegetation dries out under extreme heat, wildfire risk surges.Wildfire smoke also presents a public health threat, worsening air quality for millions.Extreme heat drives up energy demand as households rely on air conditioning. States like Texas, California, and Arizona are particularly vulnerable to blackouts or rolling brownouts due to increased electricity usage.Water utilities, transportation infrastructure (such as buckling roads and warped train tracks), and emergency services may also struggle under the stress of high temperatures.Cities like Phoenix and Los Angeles have already implemented “heat officers”—government positions dedicated to heat mitigation planning. More cities are likely to follow.While seasonal weather variations play a role, the long-term warming trend driven by climate change continues to amplify the severity of summer heat. According to NOAA’s 2025 State of the Climate Report:Scientists agree that extreme summer heat is no longer an anomaly—but a new normal.","US to experience coast-to-coast heatwaves, NOAA warns. West and Southwest, including Southern California, Arizona, and Nevada. Gulf Coast and Florida, where high humidity will exacerbate heat index values.

NEW YORK: A US federal judge on Monday cancelled the planned trial of US aviation giant Boeing over crashes of its 737 MAX aircraft that left nearly 350 people dead.The trial had been scheduled to begin June 23, but the Justice Department and Boeing reached a preliminary agreement last month to settle the long-running criminal probe into the crashes.US District Judge Reed O'Connor granted the request of both parties to vacate the trial date and cancelled the criminal trial which had been scheduled to be held in Fort Worth, Texas.But the judge still must give his final approval to the settlement and he could reschedule a trial if he fails to give the deal his green light.Under the agreement, which has drawn condemnation from some families of crash victims, Boeing will pay $1.1 billion and the Justice Department will dismiss a criminal charge over the company's conduct in the certification of the MAX.The agreement resolves the case without requiring Boeing to plead guilty to fraud in the certification of the MAX, which was involved in two crashes in 2018 and 2019 that claimed 346 lives.The Justice Department described it as ""a fair and just resolution that serves the public interest.""""The Agreement guarantees further accountability and substantial benefits from Boeing immediately, while avoiding the uncertainty and litigation risk presented by proceeding to trial,"" it said.Family members of some MAX victims slammed the proposed settlement, however, as a giveaway to Boeing.""This kind of non-prosecution deal is unprecedented and obviously wrong for the deadliest corporate crime in US history,"" Paul Cassell, an attorney representing relatives of victims, said when the settlement was announced.The Justice Department cited other family members who expressed a desire for closure, quoting one who said ""the grief resurfaces every time this case is discussed in court or other forums.""The preliminary agreement was the latest development in a marathon case that came in the wake of crashes that tarnished Boeing's reputation and contributed to leadership shakeups at the aviation giant.The case dates to a January 2021 Justice Department agreement with Boeing that settled charges that the company knowingly defrauded the Federal Aviation Administration during the MAX certification.The 2021 accord included a three-year probation period. But in May 2024, the Justice Department determined that Boeing had violated the 2021 accord following a number of subsequent safety lapses.Boeing agreed in July 2024 to plead guilty to ""conspiracy to defraud the United States.""But in December, Judge O'Connor rejected a settlement codifying the guilty plea, setting the stage for the incoming Trump administration to decide the next steps.",Boeing's planned trial over deadly 737 MAX crashes called off by US judge.

KARACHI: Members of the Hindu community in Pakistan's Sindh province held a protest against the illegal occupation of six acres of land belonging to a historical temple in Hyderabad city.The protest took place on Sunday in the Tando Jam town of the Musa Khatiyan district, about 185 kilometres from Karachi.""These people have already started illegal construction on the land belonging to the Shiv Temple Shivala in Musa Khatian,"" Hindu community leader Seetal Meghwar told the media.The protesters, including women and children, came out on the call of the Pakistan Dalit Ittehad (Pakistan Dravid Alliance), which fights for the welfare and rights of the Hindu community.""The temple is sacred for us and these builders have started construction on the land surrounding the temple, including a cremation ground for the community,"" another community leader, Ram Sundar said.The protesters demanded immediate action from the government against the builders belonging to the influential Kashkheli community in Sindh.The protest concluded with a demonstration in front of the Tando Jam Press Club following sit-ins at different spots in the town.The protesters said the builders had also blocked the access points to the Shiv temple, making it difficult for the community to hold its weekly prayer.""Despite submitting written complaints to the police and district administration, no legal action has been taken.

'Water is Our New Red Line': Pakistan Army Chief Warns India Over Indus Waters Treaty Suspension

NEW DELHI: Pakistan is staring at a bleak kharif (summer crops) sowing season with a major dip in live storage at its two key dams - Mangla on river Jhelum and Tarbela on Indus - and the ""sudden decrease"" in Chenab river inflows due to regulation of water flow by India in the aftermath of the Pahalgam terror attack.The situation may further aggravate this month during early kharif sowing and this is possibly what prompted Pakistani PM Shehbaz Sharif to raise concerns at a conference on glacier preservation in Dushanbe, Tajikistan, last week to draw global attention to India's decision to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty Latest estimates by Pakistan's Indus River System Authority (IRSA) show the country is already facing an overall shortage of 21% in water flow and around 50% in live storage of the two key dams which play a crucial role in providing water for irrigation in Punjab and Sindh provinces of Pakistan and generating hydropower.Referring to its latest assessment of availability of water for summer sowing operations during May-Sept, the IRSA in its statement ""noted with concern"" that the ""sudden decrease in river Chenab inflows at Marala due to short supply by India would result in more shortage in early kharif season"".It declared an overall shortage of 21% and advised dam authorities and irrigation supply monitoring agencies to use water from reservoirs judiciously, ""keeping in view the crisis created by Indian short supplies in Chenab river"".Though the situation may improve with monsoon rainfall in the catchment area, possibly by next month, Pakistan's farming operations will depend more on how India regulates the flow through limited infrastructure of its own reservoirs - Baglihar and Salal - on the Chenab in Jammu and Kashmir.India has, so far, only flushed these reservoirs and made additional water storage available by clearing sediments. Besides, it also stopped sharing water flow data with Pakistan after putting the 1960 treaty in abeyance following the Pahalgam massacre.Publicly available information on live storage of Pakistan's critical reservoirs shows that Mangla dam is currently left with less than 50% of its fill level (2.7 million acre feet out of the total capacity of 5.9 MAF) whereas Tarbela dam's live storage is slightly over 50% (6 MFA) of its total capacity of 11.6 MFA.Officials here believe that since India is under no obligation to share water flow data with Pakistan after suspending the IWT, it would be difficult for the neighbouring country to even manage floods during the peak flow season once monsoon hits the catchment areas of the Indus river system as a large part of it falls within India.Farming operations in two provinces of Pakistan, Punjab and Sindh, fully depend on irrigation canals linked to the Indus river system, which gets almost its entire waters from the western rivers — Indus, Jhelum and Chenab. Though India has full rights on the waters of eastern rivers (Ravi, Sutlej and Beas) under the IWT, inadequate infrastructure to use the waters by the Indian side benefits Pakistan.India is permitted to construct water storage facilities on western rivers up to 3.6 MAF but has not been able to fully utilise this, making Pakistan a beneficiary by default.","Pakistan is staring at a bleak kharif (summer crops) sowing season.

200 miles of sublime pain on a Hindu pilgrimage in Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/200-miles-of-sublime-pain-on-a-hindu-pilgrimage-in-pakistan/articleshow/121544180.cms,"Pilgrims, arriving by bus, camp overnight on the desert plain in front of the Chandragup mud volcano during their journey to the Hinglaj Devi temple in the Balochistan Province of Pakistan, May 1, 2025. (NYT News Service)





HINGOL NATIONAL PARK, PAKISTAN: When Amar Faqira's 3-year-old son abruptly lost movement in his foot last year, doctors offered little hope.As panic gripped his family, Faqira made a vow - if the boy recovered, he would make a 200-mile pilgrimage through blistering plains and jagged terrain to the Hinglaj Devi temple, a site sacred to the Hindu minority in Pakistan. It is also where Pakistan's largest annual Hindu festival is held, usually in mid-April.When the child regained strength a year later, Faqira set off in late April on a seven-day walk to the temple, nestled deep in the rust-coloured mountains of the restive Balochistan . The goddess ""heard me and healed my son,"" Faqira said before the trek, as he gathered with friends and family in his neighbourhood in Karachi. ""Why shouldn't I fulfill my vow and endure a little pain?""Faqira and two companions, wearing saffron headscarves and carrying a ceremonial flag, joined thousands of others on the gruelling journey to Hinglaj Devi. Along a winding highway and sun-scorched desert paths, groups of resolute pilgrims - mostly men but also women and children - trudged beneath the unforgiving sky, in heat that reached 45Celsius. Some bore idols of the deity, and all chanted ""Jai Mata Di"" .The pilgrimage is an act of spiritual devotion as well as cultural preservation. Pakistan's Hindus number about 4.4 million and make up less than 2% of the country's population, which is more than 96% Muslim.Hindus are often treated as second-class citizens, systemically discriminated against in housing, jobs and access to govt welfare.For many, the pilgrimage to Hinglaj Devi is comparable in significance to the Haj in Islam, a once-in-a-lifetime obligation of faith. The yearning to make the journey is also strong among Hindus in India though it is very difficult for Indians to receive visas to travel to Pakistan. States bordering Pakistan have deep spiritual links to Hinglaj Devi that are rooted in traditions predating the Partition.For much of the 20th century, the Hinglaj Devi temple remained inaccessible. The pilgrimage gained momentum only in the 1990s. A transformative shift came in the early 2000s with the construction of the Makran Coastal Highway, which links the rest of Pakistan to the Chinese-operated Gwadar deep-sea port.The highway brought unprecedented access to the temple -- it became possible to make the bulk of the journey by vehicle, taking some of the sweat out of the endeavour. Still, thousands continue to make the journey by foot. They are considered the more spiritually devoted. ""The real pilgrimage is in the pain, the feeling,"" said Faqira on the fourth day of his trek.One of his two companions collapsed from heat exhaustion after walking nearly 70 miles and had to return home by bus. Faqira carried on, his feet blistered and bandaged. Each pilgrim walks with a personal vow.Minakshi, part of a group of women dressed in yellow and red, undertook the journey to ask the goddess for a son. Nearby, 60-year-old Raj Kumari was making her seventh pilgrimage, praying for her grandson's well-being. Also on the trek was a childless couple, married since 2018.Hinglaj Devi temple is one of the sites where the remains of Sati, goddess of marital devotion and longevity, fell to Earth after her self-immolation. For many of the faithful, the pilgrimage begins with a symbolic trek to a sacred mud volcano rising from the barren landscape near the Makran Coastal Highway. At the summit, devotees toss coconuts and rose petals into the bubbling crater to seek divine permission to proceed. Many also smear volcanic clay on their faces and bodies. The next stage takes pilgrims to the Hingol River for a ritual bath. From there, they continue 28 miles to the Hinglaj Devi temple, set within a natural cave.The complex houses four shrines, the most revered being the Nani Mandir. After reaching the shrines, devotees complete the pilgrimage with an arduous, hourslong trek across seven mountains, before returning to the temple to pray.","Hinglaj Devi temple is a site sacred to the Hindu minority in Pakistan.

Shehbaz Sharif’s Tajikistan visit caps diplomatic tour amid India tensions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/did-india-hits-impede-pak-move-to-retaliate/articleshow/121499612.cms,"Photo/Agencies





ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif wrapped up a five-day, four-nation diplomatic tour in Tajikistan on Thursday, aiming to bolster regional ties and challenge India’s terrorism accusations.The tour, spanning Iran, Turkiye, Azerbaijan, and Tajikistan, came after a tense military standoff with India earlier this month. Joined by Field Marshal Asim Munir and foreign minister Ishaq Dar, Sharif sought to project Pakistan as a peace-seeking nation amid rising regional friction.The tour’s backdrop was a May 9-10 clash. Media outlets posted on Thursday videos of Sharif, during his Azerbaijan visit, purportedly admitting to India’s preemptive BrahMos missile strikes on Pakistani military sites impeding Pakistan’s attempts to retaliate. However, neither Pakistani outlets nor Azerbaijan’s govt have confirmed Sharif’s statement about BrahMos. TOI was unable to independently verify the authenticity of the video.Sharif’s mission was clear: counter India’s global push — visiting over 30 countries to brand Pakistan a terror sponsor, a charge Islamabad rejects. In Azerbaijan, he stressed Pakistan’s willingness to discuss Kashmir and terrorism with India, saying, “If India engages sincerely, we’re ready.”This stance, reiterated in Tajikistan, framed Pakistan as a peace broker while painting India as belligerent. Talks with Turkiye’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Azerbaijan’s President Ilham Aliyev aimed to lock in support against India’s rhetoric.In Tajikistan, Sharif shifted focus to economic and security ties with Central Asia, a region where India and Pakistan compete for sway. The tour, just two weeks after the standoff, reflects Pakistan’s haste to reshape its image. Yet, India’s narrative of counterterrorism retains global traction.With a fragile ceasefire extended to May 18 hanging in the balance, Sharif’s peace calls face an uphill battle against India’s military-first approach. Meetings in Türkiye and beyond highlighted Pakistan’s reliance on allies to offset India’s influence. Still, the tour’s success hinges on whether these overtures can pierce India’s diplomatic armor.The broader India-Pakistan rivalry played out vividly here — diplomacy and perception as fiercely contested as their borders. Sharif’s tour, while crisp in intent, navigates a murky web of unverified claims, strategic posturing, and regional ambitions, leaving the path to peace as elusive as ever.","Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif wrapped up a five-day, four-nation diplomatic tour in Tajikistan on Thursday.

Pak SSG Loaned Commando To Lashkar? Probe Reveals ISI’s Hand in Pahalgam Attack | Watch





NEW DELHI: Top Lashkar-e-Taiba commander and one of the plotters of the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack Saifullah Kasuri made inflammatory remarks against India at a rally in Lahore on Wednesday. Surrounded by Pakistani security forces, fellow terrorist commanders and officials of Pakistan's intelligence agency, ISI, Kasuri seemed to relish the infamy he had attracted for the massacre of innocent civilians marked out on the basis of their faith.""I have become more famous since being accused of the attack,"" he gloated, as per information reaching here.Kasuri, who had earlier disclaimed responsibility for the slaughter in Pahalgam, was sharing the stage with US-designated terrorist Talha Saeed, son of Lashkar chief Hafiz Saeed , along with Malik Ahmad Khan, speaker of the Punjab assembly - something that once again laid bare Pakistan's claim of having taken action against terrorists.Talha publicly lauded Pakistan's so called Bunyan al-Marsoos operation, in retaliation to India's Operation Sindoor. ""Allah loves those who engage in jihad,"" he said while Kasuri and others cheered.The speeches appeared to be meant to rally members of the jihadi outfit after India's successful precision strikes on the Lashkar headquarters in Muridke which killed several terrorists.In an apparent reference to PM Narendra Modi's remarks a few days ago, Kasuri said they were not afraid of bullets.""Narendra Modi samajhta hai hum goliyon se darne wale hain? Ye uski bhool hai (Modi is mistaken if he thinks we are scared of bullets),"" he said. Addressing at a rally at Bhuj earlier this week, the PM had said Pakistan should be ready to face India's bullets if it did not stop using terror as a weapon.Kasuri had earlier claimed that he had no role to play in the Pahalgam carnage. On Wednesday, he was all fire and brimstone.While claiming that Pakistan had avenged the 1971 war and the vivisection of Pakistan by the then PM Indira Gandhi, Kasuri went on to praise Pakistan's cyber team for 'targeting' India's critical infrastructure pertaining to communications and railways.During the rally, he also referenced the upcoming elections and asked the people of Kasur (his hometown) if they'd support him running against Modi in the next election.

Kasuri was spotted in Kanganpur army base in Punjab in the run-up to the Pahalgam attack where he exhorted Pakistani soldiers and spewed venom against India.On Hafiz Saeed's instructions, Kasuri, Talha and Sheikh Sajjad Gul of The Resistance Front are learned to have sent in highly trained terrorists for a ""spectacular attack' in Pahalgam.Kasuri, who was earlier president of Milli Muslim League, was also part of Jamaat-ud-Dawa's coordination committee, the 'charity' wing of Lashkar. Since the Pahalgam attack, the outfits have intensified public rallies to gather funds in the name of supporting the jihad in Kashmir.",LeT commander Saifullah Kasuri made inflammatory remarks against India at a rally in Lahore on Wednesday. Kasuri seemed to relish the infamy he had attracted for the massacre of innocent civilians marked out on the basis of their faith. He had earlier disclaimed responsibility for the slaughter in Pahalgam.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121510998,imgsize-996705,width-400,resizemode-4/121510998.jpg"

Drama In Azerbaijan: Pak PM Asks Asim Munir To Stand Up, Then Admits India's BrahMos Bombed Airbases





Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has publicly admitted, once again that Indian missiles, including the supersonic BrahMos, struck multiple locations deep inside Pakistan, including an airport in Rawalpindi.Speaking at a trilateral summit in Lachin, Azerbaijan, Sharif described how Indian strikes hit multiple targets in Pakistan before it could mount its planned retaliation.Speaking at the Pakistan-Turkiye-Azerbaijan Trilateral Summit in Lachin, Azerbaijan, Sharif described the sequence of events and Pakistan's intended response. ""We on 9th and 10th night we decided to respond in a measured fashion to Indian aggression,"" he said.""And we had decided that at 4:30 in the morning after Fajr prayers, Pakistan armed forces led very ably by our Field Marshal Chief Army Staff sitting here, Syed Asam Munir to teach a lesson to our enemy. But before that hour reached India again launched missile attacks, BrahMos and hit Pakistan's various provinces including airport in Rawalpindi and other places.""This is not the first time that Sharif has confirmed that Operation Sindoor caused severe damage in Pakistan, earlier speaking at a ceremony the Pakistani PM had acknowledged that Indian missiles struck Nur Khan Airbase in Rawalpindi and other locations.Earlier, speaking at a ceremony, he said, “At around 2.30am on May 10, General Syed Asim Munir called me on secure line and informed me that India's ballistic missiles have hit Nur Khan Airbase and other areas.”Operation Sindoor, launched by India on May following the Pahalgam terror attack, targeted terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan and PoK, killing over 100 militants. The strikes targeted nine terror launchpads in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, and was followed by the destruction of 11 Pakistani airbases after failed attempts by Pakistan to target Indian military positions.The situation de-escalated only after both sides agreed to a halt in military actions during a meeting between the Directors General of Military Operations on May 10.In the aftermath, Sharif had also made repeated appeals for dialogue, calling for talks on peace, terrorism, water, and Kashmir. Speaking in Tehran earlier this week, Sharif had said, “We want to resolve all disputes, including the Kashmir issue and the water issue, through negotiations and are also ready to talk to our neighbour on trade and counter-terrorism.” However, he warned, “But if they choose to remain aggressors, then we shall defend our territory… like we have done a few days ago. ”India has firmly rejected these overtures. At a press briefing, mministry of external affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal reaffirmed New Delhi’s position, stating, “Terrorism and talks cannot go together… Talks on J&K will be held only on the vacating of PoK and when Pakistan hands over the territory to us.”He also confirmed that the Indus Waters Treaty will remain suspended until Pakistan “credibly and irrevocably abjures its support to cross-border terrorism”, adding, “Water and blood cannot flow together.”","Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif has publicly admitted, once again that Indian missiles, including the supersonic BrahMos, struck multiple locations deep inside Pakistan.

Poll Do you believe that international attention (like the viral video) can lead to real change? Yes, it can influence change No, it rarely leads to action





In a video which has gone viral on social media, Pakistani actor Hina Bayat highlighted the issue of lack water at Pakistan's busiest Jinnah International Airport, in the country's largest city, Karachi.In the video, Bayat said, ""Today is Youm-e-Takbir. I am standing here at Karachi International Airport, and on a day when we should be celebrating Pakistan’s achievements, I see that there is no water in any of the washrooms here. People want to perform prayers, parents are taking their children to the restroom — but there is no water.""Pakistan celebrates Youm-e-Takbir (the day of greatness) as a national day to commemorate the nuclear tests it conducted on May 28 and 30, 1998.While Bayat emphasized that her country should celebrate its ""achievements"" on Youm-e-Takbir, she also drew attention to the ""alarming situation"" at the airport.""Why have our airports, our institutions, and our systems deteriorated so much? And no one is willing to admit these are mistakes which need to be fixed. So many new projects are being launched, new trains are being discussed — but the old systems, like availability of water in the washrooms of an international airport, are being ignored.It’s truly unfortunate,"" she added.The video went viral on Indian social media, as it comes in the backdrop of India putting in abeyance the Indus Water Treaty with Pakistan.Putting the water agreement in abeyance is among several diplomatic and military steps taken by India in retaliation to the terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam. On April 22, Pakistan-backed terrorists shot dead 26 men, including 25 tourists and a local, in Pahalgam.","Pakistan celebrates Youm-e-Takbir (the day of greatness) as a national day to commemorate the nuclear tests it conducted on May 28 and 30, 1998.

'Talks Only On Return Of PoK': India Rejects Pak PM Shehbaz Sharif's Call For Dialogue | Kashmir





Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday repeated his call to hold talks with India, urging both nations to sit down ""for peace"" and resolve long-standing issues, including Kashmir, water sharing, and terrorism. The change of tone in Pakistan's language can be noticed after India's punitive diplomatic steps and strong military counterterror action under Operation Sindoor against Pakistan, in retaliation of Pahalgam terror attack.His remarks came during the Pakistan-Turkiye-Azerbaijan Trilateral Summit in Lachin, Azerbaijan, where he was joined by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev.This was Sharif’s second call for dialogue in a week. On Monday, while in Tehran, he expressed a similar willingness to engage with India “to resolve all disputes.”“We must sit together and talk for the sake of peace… There are issues that demand immediate attention and must be addressed through dialogue,” Sharif said, according to Dawn.He added, “I have said in all humility that we want peace in the region[…] and that requires talks on the table on issues which need urgent attention and amicable resolution, that is the issue of Kashmir according to the resolutions of the United Nations and the Security Council and as per the aspirations of the people of Kashmir.”Sharif also expressed openness to discussing counterterrorism with India, saying, “I have said in all earnest that if India wants to talk on countering terrorism in sincerity of purpose, Pakistan would be willing to talk to India on this issue as well.” He further stated his desire to resume trade ties, and criticised India’s decision to suspend the Indus Water Treaty , calling it a vital resource for Pakistan's drinking and agricultural needs.However, India has made its stance unequivocally clear: talks with Pakistan will only focus on two issues, Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) and terrorism.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his first statement following Operation Sindoor, said: “Today, I would also like to tell the global community that our stated policy has been: if there are talks with Pakistan, it will be only on terrorism; and if there are talks with Pakistan, it will be only on Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).”Tensions between the two countries have intensified since the April 22 terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam, which left 26 dead.In retaliation, India launched Operation Sindoor, a coordinated military campaign that began on May 7, targeting nine terror launchpads in Pakistan and PoK.The Indian Air Force also destroyed 11 Pakistani airbases in response to Pakistan's failed attempts to strike Indian military positions on May 8, 9, and 10.The conflict de-escalated after both sides agreed to halt military actions following a meeting between their directors general of military operations on May 10.","Pakistan's PM Shehbaz Sharif calls for talks with India to resolve long-standing issues, including Kashmir, water sharing, and terrorism.

India's First Reaction After Bangladesh Bans Sheikh Hasina's Awami League Party

Proceedings aired live, a first for Bangladesh





DHAKA: Prosecutors at Bangladesh's International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) on Sunday formally charged former prime minister Sheikh Hasina and two others with crimes against humanity and other charges, including mass murder, for their alleged role in a violent crackdown last year in which hundreds of people were killed.The other two charged for the crimes with Hasina are former home minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal and former inspector general of police (IGP) Chowdhury Abdullah Al Mamun.""We do hereby take into cognisance the charges,"" the three-judge ICT bench led by Justice Golam Mortuza Majumdar said after a prosecution team accused them of attempting to tame the student-led protests using brutal force. The tribunal ordered investigators to present all three accused before the court on June 16. Mamun is in police custody. Hasina and Kamal are residing abroad.Sunday's proceedings marked the start of Hasina's trial in absentia nearly 10 months after the ouster of her government following protests. Under ICT law, if convicted, Hasina and the co-accused could face the death penalty.The proceedings were broadcast live on television for the first time in Bangladesh’s history.The complaint, submitted by chief prosecutor Tajul Islam, outlined five counts of alleged crimes, including murder, attempted murder, torture and other inhumane acts.The accused are also charged with abetting, inciting, facilitating and being complicit in, as well as failing to prevent, a series of crimes reportedly committed against civilians by law enforcement agencies and armed affiliates of the Awami League. One count specifically refers to a violent crackdown on unarmed student demonstrators, which allegedly followed a press briefing by Hasina on July 14. Prosecutors claim that in the aftermath, Kamal, IGP Mamun and other senior government officials were directly involved in enabling and overseeing the assault.“Upon reviewing the evidence, we concluded that it was a coordinated, widespread and systematic attack,” Islam told the court. “The accused unleashed all law enforcement agencies and her (Hasina’s) armed party members to crush the uprising.”The ICT was set up by Hasina in 2009 to investigate crimes committed by the Pakistani army during Bangladesh’s war for independence in 1971. Six top leaders of Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami and one leader of former PM Khaleda Zia’s Bangladesh Nationalist Party were hanged to death after being convicted by the court. According to a UN rights office report, some 1,400 people were killed between July 15 and Aug 15 last year as violence continued even after the fall of Hasina’s Awami League regime.","Proceedings aired live, a first for Bangladesh.

Bangladesh unveiled new currency designs, marking a significant change on Sunday.The notes no longer feature the image of its first president, who was also the father of exiled former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, ousted from power last year.The nation is home to around 170 million people and is presently under caretaker administration following Hasina's departure, coinciding with the commencement of her trial on Sunday for allegedly suppressing the August 2024 uprising against her leadership.Previously, all currency notes displayed the image of her father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who governed Bangladesh from its independence from Pakistan in 1971 until his assassination, along with most family members, during a military takeover in 1975.""Under the new series and design, the notes will not feature any human portraits, but will instead showcase natural landscapes and traditional landmarks,"" Bangladesh Bank spokesman Arif Hossain Khan told AFP.The revised designs in this predominantly Muslim country incorporate imagery of Hindu and Buddhist religious structures, alongside historical buildings.The artwork includes pieces by the renowned artist Zainul Abedin, illustrating the Bengal famine during British rule.One design features the national memorial honouring those who sacrificed their lives in the independence conflict with Pakistan.The central bank released three of nine denominations on Sunday.""The new notes will be issued from the central bank's headquarters, and later from its other offices across the country,"" he added.""The other denominations of the notes with new designs will be released in phases"".The current notes and coins will continue to be valid alongside the new currency. This alteration reflects previous changes influenced by political shifts.The initial currency from 1972, after the country's renaming from East Pakistan, featured a geographical representation.Subsequent notes displayed Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, leader of the Awami League, which Hasina later headed during her 15-year administration. During periods of alternative leadership, particularly under the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), the notes featured cultural and archaeological sites.The Awami League received a ban last month pending legal proceedings against Hasina and other party officials. Hasina, aged 77, currently resides in India by choice, refusing to comply with an extradition request for her trial attendance.","Bangladesh unveils new currency designs, marking a significant change.

We consider our ancestors to be on the lands, they become deities and this way we were tortured. If we have to die, we will die on our ancestral land,” she said.Shivu JA recalled how their houses were burnt and elephants brought to destroy their fields when they were evicted from Karadikallu. “This land is ours. It's not any tiger project or scheme of the govt for tiger conservation,” he said.“Our elders are very happy now.We are having our food, we are going for honey collection. We have our own water resource. We sit together in the evening, and they are teaching us songs. All these songs and lessons were silenced for 40 years.""“The forest department keeps saying that only after your rights are recognised, you can live on this land. We already have these rights,” he said.The Jenu Kurubas are filing a case against the Forest Department under the SC/ST Atrocities Act for withholding their rights and filing an appeal against 39 rejected forest rights claims.“Why are their rights not being recognised despite the notification of central legislation such as the Forest Rights Act 2006,” asked scholar Nitin Rai.“People across the country in different states are fighting the same battles. It is important to find a way to raise a collective voice for what is happening all over,” said lawyer Lara Jesani.","Indigenous communities across India are being pushed out of their ancestral lands in the name of tourism and expansion of tiger projects. 52 households reoccupied their ancestral land within Nagarhole tiger reserve on May 5, 35 years after their families were forcibly evicted.

Summer drought risk







LONDON: The UK experienced its warmest spring on record, and its driest in more than 50 years, the country's official weather service said on Monday.Temperatures for the season have been frequently elevated this century, according to the data from the Met Office, which said: ""Eight of the 10 warmest UK springs have occurred since the year 2000. ""The data ""clearly shows that recent decades have been warmer, sunnier, and often drier than the 20th century average,"" said Met Office scientist Emily Carlisle.The Met Office said provisional temperatures registered between March and May this year averaged 9.51 degrees Celsius (49.1 degrees Fahrenheit).That beat the last record, set in last year's spring, when the average was 9.37 degrees.The next warmest springs were in 2011, 2014 and 2007, according to the Met Office which has been recording temperature data since 1884.This year, the 128.2 millimetres (five inches) of rainfall recorded across the UK during the season was ""approximately 40 percent below the long-term average and still the driest spring in more than 50 years"", it said.""England was particularly dry, experiencing its driest spring in more than 100 years, beaten only by 1893,"" it added.The Met Office's Carlisle said: ""The UK's climate continues to change. What's particularly notable about spring 2025 is the combination of record warmth and sunshine, alongside very low rainfall.""""This spring shows some of the changes we're seeing in our weather patterns, with more extreme conditions, including prolonged dry, sunny weather, becoming more frequent,"" she said.The recent weather's dominant feature had been the persistent high-pressure systems, often coming from the Azores or mainland Europe.These had lingered over the UK since late February and blocked the usual flow of Atlantic weather fronts, allowing high pressure to dominate, the Met Office said.Last month, the Environment Agency (EA) called a meeting of its national drought group after it said levels in reservoirs were ""exceptionally low"".In the meeting, the EA's deputy water director, Richard Thompson warned that ""changing climate means we will see more summer droughts in the coming decades"".The agency added that, while there was no official drought yet, there was a ""medium risk"" of a summer drought without sustained rainfall.The UK government has said it would step in to fast-track the building of two new reservoirs.According to the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs, no new water reservoirs have been built since 1992.Scientists warn that extreme and fluctuating weather events are becoming increasingly common as planet-heating fossil fuel emissions keep rising.","The UK experienced its warmest spring on record, and its driest in more than 50 years.

L ONDON: A Turkish-born man who burned a Quran in London was on Monday found guilty of a religiously aggravated public order offence, in a case taken up by free-speech campaigners.Hamit Coskun, 50, shouted ""Islam is religion of terrorism"" and ""Quran is burning"" as he set the book alight outside the Turkish consulate in London last February 13.District Judge John McGarva at London's Westminster Magistrates' Court found Coskun guilty of using disorderly behaviour ""within the hearing or sight of a person likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress"".He was motivated by ""hostility towards members of a religious group, namely followers of Islam"", said McGarva, who issued Coskun a £240 ($325) fine, with a statutory surcharge of £96.""Your actions in burning the Quran where you did were highly provocative, and your actions were accompanied by bad language in some cases directed toward the religion and were motivated at least in part by hatred of followers of the religion,"" said the judge.State prosecutors insisted Coskun was not being prosecuted for burning the book.""He is being prosecuted for his disorderly behaviour in public,"" said Philip McGhee, for the Crown Prosecution Service.A passerby filmed the incident, which also showed a man, allegedly holding a knife or bladed item, approaching Coskun and appearing to slash out at him, the court heard.Coskun, an atheist who is currently claiming asylum in the UK, posted on social media that he was protesting against the ""Islamist government"" of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.His legal fees are being paid by the Free Speech Union (FSU) and the National Secular Society, which argued he was essentially being prosecuted for blasphemy, despite Britain's free-speech guarantees.The FSU called the verdict ""deeply disappointing"" on its X account.""Everyone should be able to exercise their rights to protest peacefully and to freedom of expression, regardless of how offensive or upsetting it may be to some people,"" it said.","Hamit Coskun, 50, shouted ""Islam is religion of terrorism"" and ""Quran is burning"" He set the book alight outside the Turkish consulate in London last February 13.

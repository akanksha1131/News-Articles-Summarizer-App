Presidential aspirations and party switch

Prominence in Trump's circle

Military service and intelligence background

Intelligence sector reform plans

US President-elect Donald Trump selected Tulsi Gabbard , an ex-Democratic congresswoman turned staunch supporter, as director of national intelligence on Wednesday. Gabbard , who holds the rank of lieutenant colonel in the Army Reserve and has combat experience in Iraq, has consistently challenged established foreign policy views.Her selection reflects Trump's preference for appointing foreign policy sceptics who question American military interventions abroad.Trump's official announcement praised Gabbard's ""fearless spirit"" and her potential contribution to intelligence agencies , emphasising ""peace through strength."" The announcement noted her transition from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party , saying she switched ""because of President Trump's leadership and how he has been able to transform the Republican Party, bringing it back to the party of the people and the party of peace.""Roger Stone, Trump's long-time associate who received a presidential pardon in 2020, initially shared the news on his X account, publishing the statement he claimed came directly from Trump.If confirmed, Gabbard would work alongside John Ratcliffe, Trump's CIA director nominee, as a principal intelligence adviser to the White House. Her responsibilities would include managing 18 intelligence organisations and coordinating the President's Daily Brief, a crucial morning intelligence summary.At 43, Gabbard was born in American Samoa and raised in Hawaii, with a brief period in the Philippines. Her political career began at 21 in Hawaii's House of Representatives, interrupted by her National Guard deployment to Iraq.As the first Hindu member of the House, she took her oath on the ""Bhagavad Gita"". She also holds the distinction of being the first American Samoan in Congress. During her four terms, she notably challenged her party's leadership. Her early backing of senator Bernie Sanders' 2016 campaign elevated her national profile amongst progressives.Her family includes her spouse, cinematographer Abraham Williams, and her father, Mike Gabbard, a state senator who transitioned from Republican to Democrat.Her 2020 Democratic presidential campaign emphasised a progressive agenda and opposition to American military interventions. She highlighted how US Middle Eastern conflicts had destabilised the region and compromised American safety. During the primaries, she notably confronted then-senator Kamala Harris about her prosecutorial record.After withdrawing and supporting Biden's candidacy, she later left the Democratic Party, criticising it as controlled by ""an elitist cabal of warmongers"" and ""woke"" ideologues. She subsequently aligned with Republicans, joined Fox News, and launched a podcast.""Today's Democratic Party is unrecognisable from the party I joined 20 years ago,"" she said regarding her departure.Her endorsement of Trump this year significantly boosted her standing among his supporters. Frequently appearing with Robert F Kennedy Jr, Gabbard exemplified Trump's claimed cross-party appeal. She assisted Trump's debate preparation against Harris and publicly announced her Republican Party membership at a North Carolina rally in October, describing the Democratic Party as ""completely unrecognizable"".Trump has included both Gabbard and Kennedy in his transition team, potentially influencing staffing and policy decisions in a future administration.Gabbard's military career spans over twenty years in the Army National Guard, including deployments to Iraq and Kuwait. She received recognition with a Combat Medical Badge in 2005 for service during Operation Iraqi Freedom III, as confirmed by the Hawaii National Guard.Unlike her predecessors, she lacks senior government experience, though she served two years on the House Homeland Security Committee.The current director, Avril Haines, confirmed in 2021, brought extensive national security and intelligence experience and made history as the first female director.Trump intends to restructure intelligence services, which he views with scepticism. He attributes past challenges to intelligence agencies' alleged interference with his previous administration and campaigns.He frequently references the ""deep state"", describing career civil servants whom he considers insufficiently loyal. ""We will clean out all of the corrupt actors in our national security and intelligence apparatus, and there are plenty of them,"" Trump declared in 2023, outlining second-term priorities.The director's role, established in 2004 post-9/11, aims to enhance interagency cooperation and prevent intelligence failures. The office has been crucial in identifying and exposing disinformation from Russia, China, and Iran regarding voting and democracy before recent elections. Its responsibilities extend to cybersecurity, counterterrorism, and counterespionage","Tulsi Gabbard is the first Hindu member of the House of Representatives.

Dogecoin , a cryptocurrency known for its Shiba Inu dog mascot, has experienced a significant price increase since Donald Trump's presidential election win.Dogecoin's value more than doubled from less than 16 cents before election day to nearly 38 cents as of Wednesday afternoon, according to CoinDesk. The surge follows a broader trend of cryptocurrency growth, with Bitcoin reaching an all-time high above $93,000.Experts attribute the rise in cryptocurrency value to Trump's positive stance on digital currencies. Trump has expressed his desire for the United States to become the ""crypto capital of the planet"" and establish a bitcoin 'strategic reserve.'Adding to Dogecoin's momentum, Elon Musk , a prominent supporter of the cryptocurrency and close ally of Trump, will lead the newly announced 'department of government efficiency."" This department, abbreviated as DOGE, will operate outside the government, offering advice and guidance to the White House.Musk's history with Dogecoin includes playing a character nicknamed 'The Dogefather' on Saturday Night Live and suggesting Twitter adopt the cryptocurrency for subscription payments.While Dogecoin initially gained popularity as a joke, it has garnered a dedicated following. Supporters believe cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin offer a decentralised alternative for online transactions, free from central bank or government influence.","Dogecoin's value more than doubled from less than 16 cents before election day to nearly 38 cents as of Wednesday afternoon.

DHAKA: A cargo vessel from Karachi docked at Chattogram port Wednesday, marking the inaugural direct maritime connection between Pakistan and Bangladesh. This underscores the Muhammad Yunus-led interim govt’s shift in regional approach as it has been working to strengthen ties with Pakistan — a country held responsible by many in Bangladesh for mass atrocities during the 1971 Liberation War.The ship arrived amid a politically sensitive environment in Bangladesh, where the govt’s recent moves have stirred both support and opposition. This comprises efforts to remove symbols of the 1971 war, including portraits of Bangladesh’s founding president Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, since an uprising ousted PM Sheikh Hasina’s govt of 15 years in Aug.Pakistani high commissioner Syed Ahmed Maroof described the establishment of the shipping route as a “major step” forward in strengthening trade and business relations. “The initiative will accelerate existing trade flows and promote new opportunities for businesses on both sides, from small traders to large exporters,” he said.","A cargo vessel from Karachi docked at Chattogram port Wednesday, marking the inaugural direct maritime connection between Pakistan and Bangladesh.

"Former US Solicitor General Ted Olson who fought for same-sex marriage, dies at 84",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/former-us-solicitor-general-ted-olson-who-fought-for-same-sex-marriage-dies-at-84/articleshow/115274381.cms,"Ted Olson , a renowned lawyer who argued many important legal cases, passed away on Wednesday at the age of 84. Olson's death was announced by his law firm, Gibson Dunn , where he had worked since 1965. The cause of death was not shared.Olson was a key figure in significant legal battles. He successfully represented George W. Bush in the 2000 Florida election dispute that reached the Supreme Court. He served as U.S. Solicitor General under President Bush from 2001 to 2004.One of Olson's most impactful cases involved representing same-sex couples seeking the right to marry in California. This case went against the views of many of his fellow conservatives. During his closing argument, Olson stated: ""It is the right of individuals, not an indulgence to be dispensed by the state. The right to marry, to choose to marry, has never been tied to procreation."" The case ultimately led to the legalization of same-sex marriage nationwide.Olson argued 65 cases before the Supreme Court throughout his career, leaving a lasting impact on American law.""Even in a town full of lawyers, Ted's career as a litigator was particularly prolific,"" said Mitch McConnell, the longtime Senate Republican leader. ""More importantly, I count myself among so many in Washington who knew Ted as a good and decent man.""Bush made Olson his solicitor general, a post the lawyer held from 2001 to 2004. Olson had previously served in the Justice Department as an assistant attorney general during President Ronald Reagan's first term in the early 1980s.""They weren't just little cases,"" said Theodore Boutrous, a partner at the law firm who worked with Olson for 37 years. ""Many of them were big, blockbuster caes that helped shape our society.""Those included the Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, a 2010 case that eliminated many limits on political giving, and a successful challenge to the Trump administration's decision to rescind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.""He's the greatest lawyer I've ever worked with or seen in action,"" said Boutrous, who worked so closely with Olson that they were known at Gibson Dunn as ""the two Teds."" ""He was an entertaining and forceful advocate who could go toe-to-toe with the Supreme Court justices in a way few lawyers could. They respected him so much.""One of Olson's most prominent cases put him at odds with many fellow conservatives. After California adopted a ban on same-sex marriage in 2008, Olson joined forces with former adversary David Boies, who had represented Democrat Al Gore in the presidential election case, to represent California couples seeking the right to marry.During closing arguments, Olson contended that tradition or fears of harm to heterosexual unions were legally insufficient grounds to discriminate against same-sex couples.A federal judge in California ruled in 2010 that the state's ban violated the U.S. Constitution. The U.S. Supreme Court let that decision stand in 2013.""This is the most important thing I've ever done, as an attorney or a person,"" Olson later said in a documentary film about the marriage case.He told The Associated Press in 2014 that the marriage case was important because it ""involves tens of thousands of people in California, but really millions of people throughout the United States and beyond that to the world.""His decision to join the case added a prominent conservative voice to the rapidly shifting views on same-sex marriage across the country.Boies remembered Olson as a giant in legal circles who ""left the law, our country, and each of us better than he found us. Few people are a hero to those that know them well. Ted was a hero to those who knew him best.""Olson's personal life also intersected tragically with the nation's history when his third wife, well-known conservative legal analyst Barbara Olson, died on Sept. 11, 2001. She was a passenger on American Airlines Flight 77, which crashed into the Pentagon.In recent years, his other high profile clients have included quarterback Tom Brady during the ""Deflategate"" scandal of 2016 and technology company Apple in a legal battle with the FBI over unlocking the phone of a shooter who killed 14 people in San Bernardino, California, in 2015.The range of his career and his statute on the national stage were unmatched, said Barbara Becker, managing partner of Gibson Dunn.""Ted was a titan of the legal profession and one of the most extraordinary and eloquent advocates of our time,"" Becker said in a statement.",Olson was a key figure in significant legal battles.

Vivek Ramaswamy: Why Musk-Ramaswamy's DOGE sounds like a Yes Minister spoof,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/doge-trump-musk-yes-minister-elon-musk-vivek-ramaswamy/articleshow/115256038.cms,"Humphreys' Introduction - Yes Minister

What is DOGE?

Trillion-Dollar Savings Plan:

AI and Automation in Government:

Decentralising Agencies and Operations:

‘Hackathons for Policy’:

Transparency Initiative:

In an uncanny reflection of Yes Minister's satire, the new US Department of Government Efficiency , or DOGE, sounds straight out of the Ministry for Administrative Affairs—a fictional British institution infamous for its comically circular logic and dedication to preserving inefficiency. Yes Minister, the 1980s British TV show, followed the bumbling Minister Jim Hacker as he grappled with a bureaucratic machine designed to self-preserve rather than reform. With the Department of Government Efficiency, a real-life version of Hacker's Ministry may have come to the US, as DOGE aims to dismantle inefficiency, echoing the same paradox that Yes Minister once lampooned.In Yes Minister, bureaucracy isn’t just a system; it’s a labyrinth engineered to perpetuate itself. The civil servants, led by Sir Humphrey Appleby , expertly stonewall any attempt at change, wielding obscure regulations and jargon as weapons. Similarly, DOGE, spearheaded by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy , is set to streamline government. Yet, like Hacker’s ministry, DOGE faces a government machine skilled in red tape and averse to rapid change. DOGE's task—applying startup efficiency to a complex bureaucracy—is an audacious ""Manhattan Project"" in its own right.The project even takes inspiration from Musk's favourite cryptocurrency, Dogecoin, which started as a joke but has since symbolised unpredictable innovation. Here, the joke coin has turned into a real-world mission. Much like Jim Hacker's naïve belief in swift reform, DOGE operates under a bold vision: dismantling the very inefficiencies that protect Washington's institutions. But, as with Yes Minister, this mission may reveal that bureaucratic inertia isn’t easily overcome, leaving Musk and Ramaswamy facing the same slow gears that ground down Hacker’s plans. In a case of reel becoming reality, DOGE is set to be both an ambitious experiment and a test of whether real reform can outwit the entrenched system.The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has been introduced by President-elect Donald Trump with an aim to “drain the swamp” by attacking Washington’s infamous bureaucracy head-on. DOGE brings together Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, each with a reputation for unorthodox approaches and a deep-seated aversion to waste. DOGE's mission is sweeping: reduce federal spending, overhaul government operations , and make the bureaucracy lean and transparent. The bold tagline for DOGE is Musk’s own phrase, “Government 2.0,” hinting at a tech-inspired revamp that seeks to streamline operations, improve service delivery, and cut down costs.DOGE aims to eliminate redundant departments, collapse overlapping agency functions, and integrate automation to make government processes more efficient. Musk, a known proponent of rapid innovation, sees DOGE as a proving ground for applying private-sector principles, such as rapid iteration and lean management, to the slow-moving gears of federal government. He likens it to a “public sector startup,” where cost-effectiveness and speed are paramount.Ramaswamy, on the other hand, brings a pragmatic approach, calling for cost-benefit analyses on every policy to justify taxpayer expenses. One of his key proposals is to introduce performance metrics for government employees, ensuring accountability at all levels. His philosophy aligns with Musk’s, focusing on achieving “return on taxpayer investment” with every initiative DOGE undertakes.To that end, DOGE has outlined several ambitious targets:DOGE has proposed a bold objective of cutting $2 trillion from the federal budget over the next five years. This would involve scaling down several programs that Musk and Ramaswamy argue have become bloated and redundant, while focusing on essential services with maximum public impact. Savings will supposedly come from digitisation and merging duplicate functions across departments.One of DOGE’s flagship proposals is to implement AI and automation in low-skill, high-volume government tasks. According to Musk, even a 10% increase in productivity through automation could result in billions in savings. Areas like data entry, administrative filings, and processing of government forms are ripe for AI-driven improvement.DOGE is also exploring the decentralisation of government agencies, potentially relocating non-essential operations outside of Washington, DC. This would not only cut costs associated with maintaining operations in the capital but would also bring federal jobs and investments to economically underdeveloped regions across the US, a move Ramaswamy has described as “democratizing government access.”Musk and Ramaswamy plan to introduce a series of “hackathons” where private-sector innovators collaborate to develop new policy ideas and solutions for DOGE. Each hackathon will focus on one of Washington’s most infamous inefficiencies, such as the Social Security processing backlog or the Department of Veterans Affairs waitlist issues. These events are intended to harness Silicon Valley-style problem-solving and bring fresh perspectives to old problems.DOGE is promising a transparency overhaul, where, in Musk’s words, “everything is on the blockchain.” By employing blockchain technology, DOGE aims to make government spending data public and tamper-proof, a bold move to win public trust and reduce corruption. Each department would have a transparent ledger of spending accessible by taxpayers, reflecting DOGE’s motto of “nothing to hide, nowhere to hide.”DOGE’s critics, however, argue that such sweeping changes could face immense resistance from an established bureaucratic machine. As Yes Minister’s Sir Humphrey Appleby would attest, civil servants often wield quiet power, capable of delaying, complicating, or outright nullifying attempts at reform. In this sense, DOGE’s goal of revolutionising Washington faces not just the challenges of scale but also entrenched opposition from within.Nevertheless, Musk and Ramaswamy are undeterred, casting DOGE as a last-resort attempt to reclaim government efficiency. Much like the fictional Ministry for Administrative Affairs, DOGE operates in a world where paradoxes abound: a department created to reduce departments, a budget-cutting office that costs millions, and a transparency promise that may get bogged down in legal red tape. Yet, if DOGE succeeds, it could set a precedent, becoming a global model for how governments can embrace tech-inspired transformation—no longer the punchline but the blueprint for administrative evolution.","Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) aims to cut $2 trillion from the federal budget over the next five years.

Despite Trump's team emphasising the importance of her attendance following Jill Biden's invitation, her office cited a book-related scheduling conflict. This was confirmed on X Wednesday morning.This decision suggests that Trump, who previously redefined the role during her first term, is establishing her independence early for her potential second tenure.""I'm not anxious because this time is different. I have much more experience and much more knowledge. I was in the White House before. When you go in, you know exactly what to expect,"" Trump said in a recent Fox News interview whilst promoting her memoir.Sources familiar with the situation indicate she plans to divide her time primarily between New York City and Palm Beach, Florida, rather than Washington, though they affirm she will maintain her first lady duties and attend significant events. Donald Trump is expected to continue his pattern of spending winter weekends at Mar-a-Lago and summer weekends at his Bedminster, New Jersey golf club. The Bidens have similarly split their time between Washington and Delaware, though maintaining the White House as their primary weekday residence.Sources indicate that Melania Trump has established a social circle in Florida over the past four years and is likely to maintain these connections.Following the 2016 election, she delayed her White House move until after her son Barron, then 10, completed his school year. Barron, now 18, attends New York University.Sources suggest she will spend considerable time at Trump Tower in New York to be near Barron. She was observed returning with him from Florida on the president-elect's private aircraft on Sunday.""I could not say I'm an empty nester. I don't feel that way,"" Melania Trump told Fox News' Ainsley Earhardt last month.""It was his decision to come here, that he wants to be in New York, study in New York, and live in his home and I respect that. … He's enjoying his college days. I hope he will have a great experience because his life is very different than any other 18-, 19-year-old child,"" she said.This unprecedented arrangement of a first lady choosing not to reside full-time at the White House aligns with Melania Trump's established pattern of non-traditional behaviour.","Melania Trump is unlikely to reside full-time in Washington during her potential second tenure as first lady.

Pete Hegseth - Secretary of Defense Nominee | SRS #143

Donald Trump's pick for defence secretary, Pete Hegseth , sparked a wave of controversy with his remarks against women serving in combat roles. In a viral clip from his appearance on the Shawn Ryan Show podcast, he argued that physical differences between men and women, such as bone density and muscle strength, create challenges in meeting the demands of combat.Hegseth said, “Everything about men and women serving together makes the situation more complicated. And complication in combat means casualties are worse.”""Everybody knows between bone density and lung capacity and muscle strength. Men and women are just different. And if there's some, you know, hard charging female that meets that standard, great, cool. Join the infantry battalion. But that is not what's happened,"" he added.Hegseth, who was a former Fox News host, criticised the military’s evolving standards, claiming that they are increasingly being tailored to integrate women into traditionally male-dominated roles. “They’re not getting tougher. If they were lowering the standard to become a Navy SEAL just to let women in, that’s going to change the capabilities and ethos of the Navy SEALs,” he argued. Hegseth suggested that, in response to political pressure, standards are subtly being relaxed to encourage female participation.""They're going to change the standards. They're going to push for quotas. We have numerous quotes in the book of no, no, these standards aren't changing. They're just evolving. They're just evolving to meet the needs of today. They're not getting tougher, I tell you that,"" he said.""And so I'm surprised there hasn't been more blowback on that already in the book, because I'm straight up just saying we should not have women in combat roles ,"" Trump's defence secretary pick added.Beyond his stance on combat roles, Hegseth has frequently criticised what he perceives as “woke” policies, particularly diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. He has called for a rollback of these programs within the Pentagon, alleging they weaken the military by diverting focus from merit and operational capability. On the same podcast, he insisted that military leadership should be reshaped, advocating for the dismissal of senior officers involved in DEI policies.Trump has described Hegseth as “tough, smart, and a true believer in America First,” emphasising that Hegseth’s views reflect an intention to overhaul military culture and reinstate traditional, merit-based standards . Known for his hard-line positions, Hegseth previously advocated for President Trump to pardon soldiers convicted of war crimes and has expressed support for redefining the department of defense as the “War Department.”","Pete Hegseth, a former Fox News host, is Donald Trump's pick for defence secretary. In a viral clip from his appearance on the Shawn Ryan Show podcast, he argued that physical differences between men and women create challenges in meeting the demands of combat.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115276931,imgsize-45280,width-400,resizemode-4/115276931.jpg"

"How DOGE, a joke crypto, became Trump's 'Manhattan Project '",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/how-doge-a-joke-crypto-became-trumps-manhattan-project-/articleshow/115265156.cms,"DOGE (Picture credit: X)

1) What’s Dogecoin (DOGE) and how did it start?







2) How Elon Musk got involved





3) Vivek Ramaswamy’s advocacy for cost-Cutting





4) The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)





5) What DOGE hopes to achieve





In a surprising turn, President-elect Donald Trump has unveiled his vision for a modern "" Manhattan Project ""—not for wartime technology, but for government efficiency. Dubbed the Department of Government Efficiency , or DOGE , the new agency brings together the eclectic minds of Tesla ’s Elon Musk and biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy to streamline Washington’s operations and drastically cut costs.The acronym DOGE is a cheeky nod to Musk’s favourite cryptocurrency, Dogecoin—a meme-inspired digital coin that started as a joke but now represents something far more ambitious in the hands of Trump’s team. Here’s how Dogecoin’s playful origins have evolved into a symbol for reform and why DOGE is now the administration's rallying cry for dismantling bureaucratic inefficiency.Dogecoin (DOGE) was created in 2013 by two Australian software developers, Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, as a parody of the crypto frenzy. Featuring the Shiba Inu dog from the viral “Doge” meme, Dogecoin was intended to poke fun at speculative hype, with its creators never imagining it would gain real-world value. However, Dogecoin quickly gained traction, fuelled by an enthusiastic community, high-profile endorsements, and a surprising spike in value. As a “joke” currency turned valuable asset, Dogecoin’s story embodies the unpredictable power of internet culture—something Musk found amusing yet full of potential.Enter Elon Musk, an innovation icon known for ambitious ventures in technology and space exploration. Musk first endorsed Dogecoin in 2019 with a playful tweet calling it his “fav cryptocurrency.” Over the years, Musk's tweets about DOGE, whether humorous or provocative, have spurred significant price spikes. But behind the lightheartedness, Musk has hinted at more practical applications, even saying that Dogecoin's streamlined, community-driven nature could highlight a path to “fix government efficiency.” His entry into the DOGE team aligns with his long-standing advocacy for cutting bureaucratic waste and simplifying outdated systems, which Musk sees as central to his broader vision of a fast, efficient government.Aligning closely with Musk’s philosophy is Vivek Ramaswamy, an entrepreneur who made his name in the biotech sector before entering politics. During his campaign, Ramaswamy rallied for a government makeover, insisting that slashing costs and reducing waste were key to unlocking efficiency. As a vocal proponent of limiting federal power and championing private-sector tactics in government, Ramaswamy’s partnership with Musk in the Department of Government Efficiency reflects a shared vision: a leaner, cost-effective government that prioritises results over tradition. Together, they seek to reduce spending and unnecessary bureaucracy—goals they see as crucial to DOGE’s mandate.President-elect Trump formalised this vision by creating the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, placing Musk and Ramaswamy at the helm. The acronym, a nod to Musk’s favourite cryptocurrency, underscores their mission to disrupt the traditional approach to government. Trump’s description of DOGE as the “Manhattan Project” for modern governance hints at the scale and urgency of the task ahead: to redefine Washington’s operational framework and increase public accountability. With Musk’s technological expertise and Ramaswamy’s cost-cutting zeal, DOGE aims to dissect federal operations, identify waste, and introduce a culture of efficiency that has rarely been seen in government circles.DOGE’s mission is ambitious. With a deadline set for July 4, 2026—the US’s 250th anniversary—the department seeks to deliver a government that operates with private-sector precision. Musk claims potential savings of over $2 trillion, and together with Ramaswamy, the goal is to introduce sweeping reforms that make government spending more transparent and efficient. If successful, DOGE’s work could transform public perception of Washington, marking a milestone in Trump’s vision for a government truly “of the people, by the people, for the people.” However, the challenges are immense, with entrenched bureaucratic systems resistant to change. For Musk and Ramaswamy, the stakes are high, and DOGE stands as a bold experiment that will either set a new standard for public service or reveal the limits of applying business logic to the sprawling federal government.","President-elect Donald Trump has unveiled his vision for a modern "" Manhattan Project "" Dubbed the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, the new agency brings together the eclectic minds of Tesla ’s Elon Musk and biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy.

"Pete Hegseth: Trump picks tattooed, 44-year-old MAGA supporter and Fox News host as defence secretary",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-picks-tattooed-44-year-old-maga-supporter-and-fox-news-host-as-defence-secretary/articleshow/115264746.cms,"US President-elect Donald Trump and Pete Hegseth

TOI Correspondent from Washington:

US President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday named a heavily-tattooed mid-level ex-soldier turned Fox News host Pete Hegseth as the in-coming defence secretary, as he continued to choose nominees from the MAGA right field for top jobs in his incoming administration.Trump also named John Ratcliffe, a former Texas congressman and Director of National Intelligence (DNI) in during his first term, as CIA Director , and former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee to serve as the US ambassador to Israel.Hegseth and Ratcliffe have a strong anti-China orientation, and Huckabee is strongly pro-Israel to the extent he supports its claim over the entire West Bank which forms a large part of Palestine.But it is Trump's choice of 44-year-old Hegseth as defence secretary that jolted the capital, where the job has typically gone to traditional establishment veterans with deep expertise in military and strategic matters, including during his first term. He selected a four-star general, James Mattis and an Army secretary, Mark Esper, to lead the Pentagon. Mattis resigned and Esper was later fired, two casualties amid a heavy turnover during the Trump One administration.Hegseth, a relative lightweight, is a fire-brand provocateur who served combat tours in Afghanistan and Iraq as a captain and platoon leader, before cycling through think-tanks and advocacy groups, and finally becoming a Fox News host.In fact, Trump critics noted that the only reason Hegseth is being tapped to be defence secretary is ""because he's on Fox News, and that's what Donald Trump picks are based on."" Among several controversial remarks he has made in recent times is calling for the firing of so-called ""woke generals"" and opposing combat roles for women in the military.He is also heavily tattooed, bearing several across his arms and chest, including one of the Jerusalem cross, which has perceived links to Christian nationalism. One tattoo emblazoned across his arm says ""We The People"" and on his bicep is the phrase ""Deus Vult"" -- God Willing, a battlecry for Christians during the First Crusade.But it is Hegseth's remarks on China that will stir interest in capitals looking forward to Trump's pledge of no wars. In one fiery podcast, he spoke of Washington being oblivious to China’s growing power while Beijing was explicitly building a military to defeat the United States. “The Pentagon runs perfect war game simulations. We lose every time to China… They’re building an army…We have our heads up our asses,” he said.The choice of Hegseth for Defence and Ratcliffe for CIA also set at rest rampant speculation -- and lobbying by their supporters -- that former Democratic lawmaker turned Trump supporter Tulsi Gabbard, and MAGA acolyte Kash Patel were respectively in line for the two jobs.","Pete Hegseth is a heavily-tattooed mid-level ex-soldier turned Fox News host.

Beijing is pushing Pakistan to allow its own security staff to provide protection to thousands of Chinese citizens working in the South Asian nation, during talks after a car bombing in Karachi that was seen as a major security breach, sources said.Last month’s airport bombing in the southern port city that killed two Chinese engineers returning to work on a project after a holiday in Thailand was the latest in a string of attacks on Beijing’s interests in Pakistan. The attacks, and Islamabad’s failure to deter them, have angered China, which has pushed Pakistan to begin formal negotiations for a joint security management system .Reuters spoke to five Pakistani security and govt sources with direct knowledge of the previously unreported negotiations, and reviewed a written proposal sent by Beijing to Islamabad. “They (Chinese) want to bring in their own security,” said one official, who sat in on a recent meeting, adding that Pa kistan had not so far agreed to such a step.A written proposal sent to Islamabad by Beijing, and forwarded to Pakistani security agencies for review, mentioned a clause allowing the dispatching of security agencies and military forces into each others’ territory to assist in counter-terrorism missions and conduct joint strikes. The dispatching would be done after discussions, but Pakistani agencies were averse to the proposal, one official said.Neither Beijing nor Islama bad confirmed the talks officially. The source, and two other officials, said there was a consensus on setting up a joint security management system, and that Pakistan was amenable to Chinese officials sitting in on security meetings and co-ordination. But there was no agreement on their participating in security arrangements on the ground. The first official said Pakistan had asked China for help in improving its intelligence and surveillance capabilities instead of direct involvement.The nature of the Karachi bombing has angered Beijing: A pick-up truck rigged with nearly 100 kg of explosives waited unchecked for 40 minutes near the outermost security cordon of the heavily guarded airport before its driver rammed it into the vehicle carrying Chinese engineers, officials said. “It was agrave security breach,” admitted one of the officials investigating the blast. Investigators believe the attackers had “inside help” in securing details of the itinerary and route.","Beijing is pushing Pakistan to allow its own security staff to provide protection to thousands of Chinese citizens working in the South Asian nation.

Over 11 million children under five years of age are exposed to this smog in the worst-affected districts.""He noted that even before this year’s record-breaking smog, 12% of deaths in children under five in Pakistan were attributed to air pollution—a number likely to increase with the ongoing crisis.Fadil warned of the additional risks to expectant mothers, stating that exposure to polluted air increases the likelihood of premature births, respiratory complications, and low birth weight. ""When pregnant women are exposed to polluted air, they are more likely to give birth prematurely, face respiratory issues, and their babies may have a low birth weight. We cannot afford to let our babies breathe toxic air. We cannot let the health, education, and well-being of millions of children suffer,"" he said.Calling on the government for immediate intervention, Fadil said that clean air is a fundamental right for every child, highlighting the urgency of protective measures to safeguard the health of Pakistan's youngest citizens amidst this crisis.Dawn reported that Punjab's Air Quality Index (AQI) has surged to critical levels, with seven districts, including Sialkot, registering AQI readings above 400 and one district reaching a staggering 774.In response to this escalating public health emergency, local authorities have temporarily closed schools until November 17. Residents are also being restricted from public parks, zoos, playgrounds, and museums to limit their exposure to the dangerous smog levels.The Unicef office in Islamabad highlighted that cities like Lahore and Multan are recording unprecedented levels of air pollution, with hospitals admitting numerous patients affected by the toxic air, including dozens of young children.","Unicef representative in Pakistan Abdullah Fadil warned of severe health risks facing around 11 million children.

'Army chief for life': How the 'establishment' is tightening its grip on elected government in Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/army-chief-for-life-how-the-establishment-is-tightening-its-grip-on-elected-government-in-pakistan/articleshow/115173618.cms,"Implication of the amendment

The 'establishment'



Not the first time

More changes



The recent amendment to the Pakistan Army Act, which extends the tenure of the Chief of Army Staff (COAS) from three to five years, has sparked significant debate and concern regarding the implications for civil-military relations in Pakistan .This legislative change, hastily approved by the ruling coalition led by PM Shehbaz Sharif's PML-N, not only lengthens the term of the army chief but also removes the retirement age limit for four-star generals, effectively allowing military leaders to remain in power indefinitely.The amendment allows the current COAS, General Asim Munir , who was appointed in November 2022 and was set to retire in 2025, to potentially serve until 2027 or longer if further extensions are granted. This change is seen as a continuation of a trend where military leaders have managed to extend their tenures beyond traditional limits.The amendment was moved by defence minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif and received majority support despite strong opposition protests from the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, led by former PM Imran Khan.The PTI lawmakers criticised the expedited process of passing such crucial legislation without adequate debate, arguing that it undermines democratic principles in a country already grappling with political instabilityThe removal of the retirement age limit for the army chief raises critical concerns about the balance of power between civilian governance and military authority in Pakistan.Critics argue that this move consolidates military power at a time when civilian institutions are already perceived as weak. The ability for an army chief to remain in power indefinitely could lead to a scenario where military influence over political affairs becomes even more pronounced, effectively sidelining elected representatives.Michael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center, noted that such legislative actions transform the legislative into a ""rubber stamp"", thereby diminishing democratic governance.The Pakistan army has been a dominant force in the country's political landscape since its inception in 1947, often overshadowing elected governments.The military's involvement in politics began almost immediately, with its first significant intervention occurring in 1958 when General Muhammad Ayub Khan led a coup against the civilian government, citing corruption and inefficiency.Since that initial coup, the army has directly ruled the country for about 36 years, while also exerting considerable influence during periods of civilian rule.Major coups occurred under Ayub Khan (1958), Yahya Khan (1969), and Zia-ul-Haq (1977), each time justifying military rule as necessary for national stability.The military's rationale often centered around restoring order amid political chaos, which has led to a cycle of governance where elected officials frequently find themselves subordinate to military interests.The intertwining of military and political affairs has given rise to what analysts describe as the ""establishment"" or ""deep state"", where the military operates behind the scenes to influence policy decisions even when not in direct control.This dynamic has allowed the army to maintain significant control over key areas such as foreign policy, security, and economic management. For instance, during recent political upheavals, including the ousting of former Prime Minister Imran Khan in 2022, the military played a crucial role in shaping political outcomes.Elected governments have often been compelled to align their policies with military interests.Political leaders are acutely aware that their tenure could be jeopardized by military intervention if they stray too far from the army's preferences. This has led to a pattern where civilian governments consult with military leaders on critical issues, particularly those involving national security and foreign relations. The recent amendments to extend the tenure of the Chief of Army Staff reflect this ongoing power dynamic, allowing military leadership to exert even greater influence over governance without the constraints of a retirement age.In defense of the amendments, government officials have argued that extending military tenures is essential for maintaining stability and continuity in Pakistan's security leadership amid regional tensions. They contend that allowing military chiefs to serve longer terms will enable them to address national security challenges without disruptions caused by frequent leadership changes.Supporters of the amendment also claim that aligning military leadership tenures with other constitutional offices—many of which have five-year terms—provides a rational framework for governance.The legislative change is not unprecedented in Pakistan's history.Previous army chiefs have also enjoyed extended tenures through similar amendments or political maneuvering.General Qamar Javed Bajwa had his term extended multiple times during his tenure from 2016 to 2022.The pattern of extending military leadership has become almost standard practice, raising questions about accountability and oversight within Pakistan's political system.Observers note that General Munir's potential extended tenure could mirror historical figures like General Zia-ul-Haq, whose prolonged rule led to widespread discontent among both military ranks and civilians due to perceived mismanagement and authoritarian practices.The removal of age limits and potential for indefinite extensions could lead to a scenario where future army chiefs similarly consolidate power.Moreover, there are concerns that these changes may pave the way for further legal amendments aimed at consolidating military power across other branches of government.For instance, recent discussions around increasing the number of Supreme Court judges could be interpreted as an attempt to ensure favorable judicial outcomes for military interests.","The Pakistan army has been a dominant force in the country's political landscape since its inception in 1947.

Pakistan's Punjab province has introduced strict measures to combat rising illnesses caused by severe air pollution. Starting Monday, most outdoor activities are banned, and shops, markets, and malls in certain areas are required to close early.This move follows an earlier decision to shut down educational institutions and public spaces like parks and zoos in Lahore and nearby districts until November 17.Lahore, which has been ranked as the world's most polluted city by Swiss air quality monitor IQAir, recently recorded an Air Quality Index (AQI) of over 600, significantly lower than the alarming 1,900 it reached earlier in the month. For context, an AQI between 0-50 is considered 'good'.The worsening air quality has led to a sharp increase in cases of respiratory diseases, eye irritation, and conjunctivitis in districts like Lahore, Multan, Faisalabad, and Gujranwala.The Punjab government noted an unprecedented rise in patients suffering from these conditions, attributing the spread of pink eye disease to dust, smoke, and chemical exposure.As part of the new restrictions, outdoor sports events, exhibitions, and festivals have been prohibited, while essential religious activities remain exempt. Pharmacies, dairy shops, and vegetable outlets are allowed to operate until 8 pm (local time).The pollution crisis has been particularly severe in Lahore, where thick smog has caused reduced visibility, leading to road accidents. In one incident, nine people were injured on GT Road when a van collided with a parked truck due to the dense haze.Authorities in Multan are facing even more critical conditions, with the AQI reaching over 2,000 last Friday. The concentration of PM2.5 particles, a harmful pollutant known to cause severe respiratory issues, was recorded at 947 micrograms per cubic meter, which is nearly 190 times higher than World Health Organization guidelines.Critics have pointed out that the government has been slow to enforce preventive measures, with many residents seen without masks despite the hazardous air quality.Authorities have blamed cross-border winds from India for exacerbating the smog, claiming that pollutants drifting from across the border have worsened the air quality in Pakistan’s Punjab province. The Punjab government has expressed its intention to take up the issue with Indian authorities through diplomatic channels.","Pakistan's Punjab province has introduced strict measures to combat rising illnesses caused by severe air pollution.

LAHORE: Pakistan's Punjab province banned most outdoor activities and ordered shops, markets and malls in some areas to close early from Monday to curb illnesses caused by intense air pollution.The province has already closed educational institutions and public spaces like parks and zoos until Nov. 17 in places including Lahore, the world's most polluted city in terms of air quality according to Swiss group IQAir's live ratings.The districts of Lahore, Multan, Faisalabad, and Gujranwala have seen an unprecedented rise in patients with respiratory diseases, eye and throat irritation, and pink eye disease, the Punjab government said in an order issued late on Sunday.The new restrictions would also remain in force until Nov. 17, it said.""The spread of conjunctivitis/ pink eye disease due to bacterial or viral infection, smoke, dust or chemical exposure is posing a serious and imminent threat to public health,"" it said.While outdoor activities including outdoor sports events, exhibitions and festivals, and outdoor dining at restaurants have been prohibited, ""unavoidable religious rites"" are exempt from this direction, the order said.Some outlets like pharmacies, oil depots, dairy shops, and fruit and vegetable shops have similarly been exempted from the directions to close by 8 p.m. local time.Lahore's air quality remained hazardous on Monday, with an index score of more than 600, according to IQAir, but this was significantly lower than the 1,900 that it touched in some places earlier this month.A score of 0-50 is considered 'good'.Several parts of South Asia are engulfed by a toxic haze each winter as cold air traps dust, emissions, and smoke from farm fires.Punjab has blamed its particularly toxic air this year on pollution wafting in from India, where northern parts have also been battling hazardous air, and has said it will take the issue up with the neighbouring country through its foreign ministry.India's Supreme Court on Monday directed the Delhi government to decide by Nov. 25 on imposing a 'perpetual ban' on firecrackers, legal news portal Bar and Bench reported.Firecrackers set off by revellers on Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights that was celebrated on Oct. 31 this year despite a ban, has aggravated the region's pollution problem.","Pakistan's Punjab province has banned most outdoor activities and ordered shops, markets and malls in some areas to close early.

Users described difficulties connecting, with VPN Unlimited showing a peak of reported problems at around 6:15 pm and TunnelBear users noting connectivity issues into the evening.For many Pakistanis, VPNs are a vital tool for accessing blocked sites, including X (formerly Twitter), which has been restricted due to national security concerns. This recent wave of connectivity issues has reignited discussions over digital freedom and government policies limiting online access.Prime Minister Sharif's recent tweet congratulating Trump for his second term win garnered significant attention for both its content and the reaction it received. In his message, Sharif wrote, ""Congratulations to President-elect Donald Trump on his historic victory for a second term! I look forward to working closely with the incoming administration to further strengthen and broaden the Pakistan-US partnership.” However, X attached a community note to the tweet, pointing out that Sharif himself had banned X in Pakistan and was likely using a VPN to access the platform, which is “unlawful under Pakistani law.”This community note intensified debates over VPN usage in the country, with some citizens arguing that restrictive internet policies compel even government officials to bypass their own regulations. Another note was attached to a subsequent tweet by Sharif, congratulating Pakistan’s cricket team.In February, X was banned in Pakistan, with authorities citing “national security concerns” and non-compliance with local laws as justification. Despite the restrictions, X remains a key platform for official statements from the government.Last August, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) announced plans to scrutinise VPN services in the country, aiming to limit access to only those services that align with government regulations.

However, loans are still necessary to service existing debts, most of which are owed to Western financial institutions.The country had anticipated raising $3.2 billion against the $2.5 billion in debt needs since IMF’s approval of a $7 billion package for Pakistan in September. This included a $1.2 billion Saudi oil facility.As per sources, no agreement has been reached regarding the Saudi oil facility, five months into the fiscal year.Each month of delay reduces available funds by $100 million within the fiscal year. Pakistani authorities remain optimistic about convincing Riyadh to extend the facility. However, finance ministry spokesperson Qumar Abbasi did not respond to queries regarding the status of the $1.2 billion oil facility.Apart from IMP, Pakistan is also seeking a $1 billion loan from Dubai Islamic Bank, while requesting China to reschedule $3.4 billion in debt from China's Export-Import (Exim) Bank.Out of this amount, approximately $750 million is due in the current fiscal year. The rescheduling of this debt has been included in the country's external financing plans, as per sources.Due to its weakened financial position and the constraints imposed by the IMF agreement, Pakistan lacks the flexibility to repay its debt to China.Around $3.9 billion, of the total $6.5 billion in Chinese commercial debt, is due in the current fiscal year. The government successfully rolled over a $200 million debt that matured in September. However, sources suggest that no progress has been made in arranging another rollover, with a $1 billion payment due in March 2025.As part of its $3.2 billion plan, the government also secured Pakistan's most expensive loan in history—a $600 million facility from Standard Chartered Bank. The finance minister stated that this facility would not be utilized, while the IMF distanced itself from the loan arrangement.IMF's unexpected visit comes just six weeks after the loan's approval and four months before the planned review, which will evaluate performance against the July-September targets and assess progress for the October-December 2024 quarter.Official figures show a tax collection shortfall of Rs 190 billion over the past four months, with the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) collecting Rs 3.440 trillion, against a target of Rs 3.632 trillion, despite record-high taxes this year.",IMF's unexpected visit comes just six weeks after the loan's approval and four months before the planned review.

At least 26 people — 14 soldiers, six railway employees and six civilian passengers — were killed and more than 60 injured in a suicide bombing at a railway station in Pakistan’s southwestern city of Quetta on Saturday. The proscribed Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), the most prominent militant group in the restive province, claimed responsibility for the attack, saying its suicide unit, the Majeed Brigade, had carried out the bombing to target a “Pakistani army unit” returning via train after completing a course at an infantry school.Authorities said the blast was a “suicide attack” primarily on law enforcement agencies, while civilians were also targeted. Forty-six among the injured were Pakistan army soldiers, police said. The explosion occurred as a popular morning train, Jaffar Express, was about to leave a station in Quetta for Peshawar in the northwest.Pakistan Railways had restored train services between Quetta and Peshawar last month after a suspension of seven weeks because separatist militants in Balochistan had blown up a key railway bridge in Aug.Social media videos captured Saturday’s explosion. The bomb went off when hundreds of people were at the platform. A video of the aftermath showed injured individuals and debris strewn throughout the station. The steel structure of the platform’s roof had been ripped apart.“The target was army personnel from the Infantry School,” said Muazzam Jah Ansari, police chief of Balochistan province.Wasim Baig, spokesperson for the provincial health department, said the death toll rose to 26 after two people succumbed to their injuries in hospital while 62 others were injured.The BLA has long waged an armed rebellion, driven by demands for independence and control over the province’s gas and mineral resources.Balochistan CM Sarfraz Bugti called the act deplorable and the perpetrators “worse than animals”. He said the authorities would pursue them and “bring them to their logical end”.Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif denounced the bombing, saying those who orchestrated the attack “will pay a very heavy price for it”, adding that security forces were determined to eliminate “the menace of terrorism”.A decades-old insurgency has destabilised Balochistan and created security concerns for China-led projects trying to access the province’s untapped resources. In Aug at least 73 people were killed in Balochistan province after separatist militants attacked police stations, railway lines and highways.Balochistan is Pakistan’s largest province and the richest in terms of natural resources, but it is the least developed. The region shares a volatile border with Iran and Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, and also boasts a vast coastline along the Arabian Sea.The govt’s military operation to suppress the separatist movement in the province has resulted in widespread human rights abuses against Baloch dissenters, including disappearances, torture and extrajudicial killings.","14 soldiers, six railway employees and six civilian passengers killed.

BAKU: Bangladesh's interim leader Muhammad Yunus said Wednesday that world leaders shouldn't be negotiating at United Nations climate talks this year, and countries responsible for warming up the planet should instead just simply provide the funds to deal with the climate crisis.""Why should there be a negotiation? You are causing the problem, then you solve it,"" he told The Associated Press in an interview in Baku, Azerbaijan. ""We will raise our voice and tell them it's your fault, like what we did with colonialism.""Yunus was chosen to head Bangladesh's interim government after the nation's longtime prime minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled abroad. Her resignation followed intense political turmoil earlier this year, with weeks of protests and clashes with security forces that killed nearly 300 people. Known as the ""banker to the poorest of the poor,"" Yunus was a longtime critic of Hasina.Yunus said the climate negotiations, known as COP29, can be ""humiliating"" for poor countries. Yunus likened the talks to a ""fish market"" packed with people trying to get the best bargains. ""That's a very wrong perception of the whole thing,"" he said.Bangladesh is among the most vulnerable countries in the world to climate change. Various scientific reports have found that the South Asian nation could lose up to 17% of its land to rising seas and is also at the brunt of increasingly more frequent and intense cyclonic storms.But ""everyone's home is on fire,"" said Yunus. He said rich nations, who developed their economies by burning planet-warming coal, oil and gas, are ""not safe either. So they have to act in their self-interest as well as the interest of the whole planet.""Yunus said he will dedicate his time as leader to clean energy projects in Bangladesh and protecting the population against climate change.""Whether it's an interim government or no government or a democratic government, whatever government is in power should be aware and has to work hard to stop that fire,"" he said.","Yunus was chosen to head Bangladesh's interim government after the nation's longtime prime minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled abroad.

BNP worried interim govt may extend tenure

DHAKA: Bangladesh’s newly appointed interim govt adviser Mahfuj Alam has removed the portrait of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman from the Darbar Hall of Banga Bhaban, in what critics said was “complete and utter disrespect” of the country’s first president and the constitution.Banga Bhaban is the residence and main workplace of the President of Bangladesh.Posting a photo of himself at Darbar Hall after taking oath on Sunday, Mahfuj on Monday wrote on Facebook: “It is a shame for us that we couldn’t remove his pictures from Banga Bhaban after the 5th of August. Apologies.”A political activist, who wished to remain unnamed, suggested that the removal of Mujib’s portrait from Darbar Hall might be linked to a desire to alter the constitution and erase the spirit of 1971 Liberation War , “promoting a Pakistani ideology in Bangladesh”.The Bangladesh constitution mandates that the portrait of Mujibur be preserved and displayed at the offices of the president, PM, speaker, and chief justice, as well as at all govt and semi-govt offices.Mujibur is also the father of deposed PM Sheikh Hasina “No individual should change it (the constitution) with the stroke of a pen,” Kamal Hossain , one of the framers of the current constitution said, adding, “reforms should be carried out only after taking people’s opinions into account”.Suspecting that Bangladesh’s interim govt may be thinking of extending its tenure, the BNP has reminded the Muhammad Yunus-led dispensation that its primary duty is to promptly transfer power to elected representatives after conducting a fair election.On Monday, senior BNP politician Hafizuddin Ahmed claimed several individuals with pro-Awami League affiliations had been appointed to the interim govt’s advisory council.Two leading coordinators of the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement have also criticised the new govt additions.The interim govt was expanded Sunday with the addition of three new advisers.

DHAKA: Bangladesh’s interim govt said on Sunday that it would request an Interpol “red notice” alert to repatriate deposed PM Sheikh Hasina and her Awami League colleagues from abroad to face trial for alleged crimes against humanity. They are accused of involvement in “killings and genocide” during the student-led uprising in July-Aug that led to Hasina’s ouster. “It will be done very soon,” law adviser Asif Nazrul said on Sunday.France-based Interpol publishes red notices at the request of a member nation, based on an arrest warrant issued in their home country. The Yunus-led administration has moved quickly to try the top Awami League functionaries, including Hasina and general secretary Obaidul Quader, by having arrest warrants issued against them through International Crimes Tribunal (ICT). A local court has ordered the authorities to arrest and present them before it by Nov 18. ICT chief prosecutor Muhammad Tajul Islam said steps would be taken to bring Awami League to justice if the govt issues directives.The development came even as complaint of “genocide” and other crimes was filed at the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague against 62 individuals, including interim govt chief adviser Muhammad Yunus.The complaint was filed by former Sylhet mayor Anwaruzzaman Chowdhury. Other than Yunus and his advisers, Chowdhury also wants co-ordinators of the students’ uprising prosecuted. Chowdhury has alleged “genocide and crimes against humanity against Awami League’s leaders and activists, Hindus, Christians, Buddhists and police in Bangladesh, all of whom were killed in the name of the students’ movement”. The complaint was lodged under Article 15 of ICC’s Rome Statute, which empowers individuals and others to send information on crimes within the court’s jurisdiction. Yunus’ law adviser Nazrul dismissed the plea as an attempt to mislead global opinion. “This is not a case. It is just a petition. Any person can do that,” he said.",Bangladesh's interim govt wants to repatriate deposed PM Sheikh Hasina and her Awami League colleagues from abroad.

Hasina, who ruled for 15 years, faced accusations of widespread human rights abuses, including extrajudicial killings and mass detentions of political opponents.Red notices alert law enforcement agencies worldwide about fugitives, but they do not compel countries to arrest and extradite the individuals. According to Interpol, each member country applies its own laws when deciding whether to act on a red notice.Hasina has been summoned to appear in a Dhaka court on November 18 to face charges of ""massacres, killings, and crimes against humanity.""Mohammad Tajul Islam, the chief prosecutor of Bangladesh's International Crimes Tribunal (ICT), said the court had issued arrest warrants for over 60 individuals, with around 25 arrests made so far.","Bangladesh announces it will request Interpol ""red notice"" alert for fugitive leaders.

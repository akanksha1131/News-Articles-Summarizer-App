Six Americans who had been detained in Venezuela were freed after a meeting between President Nicolás Maduro and a senior Trump administration official, Richard Grenell, on Friday.Grenell, appointed as an envoy for special missions by US President Donald Trump, shared a photo on social media showing himself with the released Americans aboard an aircraft.“We are wheels up and headed home with these 6 American citizens. They just spoke to @realDonaldTrump and they couldn’t stop thanking him”, Grenell wrote in the shared post.The meeting was part of broader efforts by the Trump administration to secure the release of detained US citizens and address migration issues with Venezuela.Grenell’s visit marked a significant shift, as it came as a surprise to many, with some Venezuelans expecting Trump to continue his “maximum pressure” campaign against Maduro.The focus of the mission, however, was on deporting Venezuelan criminals from the US back to their home country and ensuring the return of detained Americans , as outlined by White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. The US has been working to deport Venezuelans, particularly members of criminal groups, back to Venezuela.The visit also comes amid heightened tensions in Venezuela, where Maduro was recently sworn in for a third term despite disputed election results. The US does not recognise Maduro’s victory and has expressed concerns over the legitimacy of his government.While Grenell's meeting with Maduro was part of a specific diplomatic effort, some Republicans criticized it, fearing that it could legitimize Maduro’s rule.However, the Trump administration emphasised that the release of the detained Americans was a critical priority.","Six Americans who had been detained in Venezuela were freed after a meeting between President Nicolás Maduro and a senior Trump administration official.

US education department reverts to Trump-era campus sexual misconduct rules,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-education-department-reverts-to-trump-era-campus-sexual-misconduct-rules/articleshow/117809058.cms,"File photo: US President Donald Trump (Picture credit: AP)

The US department of education announced on Friday that schools and universities must adopt the policies established during President Donald Trump ’s first term, particularly regarding sexual misconduct investigations . These policies, which include live hearings and enhanced protections for accused students, will replace those implemented under the Biden administration .The guidance clarifies that Title IX , the 1972 law prohibiting sex-based discrimination in educational institutions, will be enforced following rules introduced by former education secretary Betsy DeVos . These rules, which govern how schools handle misconduct complaints, have been in effect since 2020 and outline a detailed process for investigating and resolving disputes between students.This shift follows a federal court ruling in Kentucky on January 9, which overturned Biden's Title IX revisions. The judge determined that the Biden administration’s updates, which expanded Title IX to cover sexual orientation and gender identity, overstepped presidential authority and violated free speech rights by compelling schools to honour students’ preferred pronouns.As per the AP, the education department now requires that all ongoing investigations be aligned with the 2020 DeVos rules. This includes the continuation of practices such as live hearings, where students can cross-examine each other with legal representation. The Biden-era guidelines, which eliminated this requirement, had been widely criticised by due process advocates, who argue the old rules ensure fairness for both the accused and the accuser.Tyler Coward, from the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE), praised the return to the 2020 rules, stating, “The return to the 2020 rules ensures that all students — whether they are the accused or the accuser — will receive fair treatment and important procedural safeguards .”Critics, however, argue that the Trump-era rules, particularly the live hearing requirement, will deter victims of sexual violence from coming forward. Emma Grasso Levine, from Know Your IX , expressed concern that these changes leave many vulnerable students, including LGBTQ+ individuals and survivors of assault, without necessary protections.The memo issued by the education department also highlighted the department’s responsibility to enforce these rules, emphasising the role of presidential authority. The rules reduce schools’ liability, holding them accountable only if they act with “deliberate indifference” to the misconduct.","The US department of education announced on Friday that schools and universities must adopt policies established during President Donald Trump ’s first term.

Pentagon to deploy over 1000 additional troops for Trump's immigration crackdown,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/pentagon-to-deploy-over-1000-additional-troops-for-trumps-immigration-crackdown/articleshow/117810101.cms,"The Pentagon is set to deploy at least 1,000 additional active-duty troops as part of US President Donald Trump’s intensified efforts to curb illegal immigration, US officials said on Friday.This includes roughly 500 soldiers, mainly a headquarters unit from the 10Mountain Division at Fort Drum, New York, who will be sent to the US-Mexico border. Additionally, about 500 Marines will be stationed at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to assist with the detention of migrants.According to officials cited by AP, discussions regarding troop numbers are ongoing, and further deployments may be considered. These actions follow Trump's executive orders, signed shortly after his inauguration on January 20, directing a military-led reinforcement of border security.Last week, the first contingent of 1,600 active-duty personnel was deployed to the southern border. The troops stationed at the border are expected to assist with setting up concertina wire barriers, transportation, intelligence gathering, and logistical support for Border Patrol agents. Meanwhile, those assigned to Guantanamo Bay will work on preparing the facility for an anticipated influx of detainees and performing other support duties.Speaking on ""Fox & Friends"" on Friday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth stated that the US could detain ""thousands of individuals in tents, secured in places at Guantanamo Bay."" He also noted the potential detention of violent criminals and gang members, highlighting the defense department’s plans to prepare high-security detention facilities at Guantanamo for such individuals.Officials have signaled that additional troop deployments could be announced in the coming days, with estimates suggesting the total deployment could reach 10,000. Prior to these moves, approximately 2,500 National Guard and Reserve forces were stationed along the nearly 2,000-mile southern border.The US military is also assisting the department of homeland security in deportation flights for over 5,000 detained migrants, with some expected to be held at the US military base in Guantanamo Bay. On Wednesday, President Trump said that his administration planned to send the “worst criminal aliens” to Guantanamo and ordered the Pentagon to prepare facilities for up to 30,000 detainees.This is not the first time migrants have been detained at Guantanamo Bay. The US has previously housed migrants intercepted at sea, including individuals from Haiti and Cuba, at a facility known as the Migrant Operations Center. However, the current plans represent an unprecedented expansion of the detention policy.","The Pentagon is set to deploy at least 1,000 additional active-duty troops as part of US President Donald Trump’s intensified efforts to curb illegal immigration.

It also directed agencies to disband employee resource groups, terminate grants and contracts related to the issue, and replace the term ""gender"" with ""sex"" on government forms.Some parts of government websites appeared with the message: ""The page you're looking for was not found."" Some pages disappeared and came back intermittently.Asked by reporters Friday about reports that government websites were being shut down to eliminate mentions of diversity, equity and inclusion, Trump and said he didn't know anything about it but that he'd endorse such a move.""I don't know. That doesn't sound like a bad idea to me,"" Trump said, adding that he campaigned promising to stamp out such initiatives.Much public health information was taken down from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 's website: contraception guidance; a fact sheet about HIV and transgender people; lessons on building supportive school environments for transgender and nonbinary kids; details about National Transgender HIV Testing Day; a set of government surveys showing transgender students suffering higher rates of depression, drug use, bullying and other problems.Eliminating health resources creates dangerous gaps in scientific information, disease experts said. The Infectious Diseases Society of America , a medical association, issued a statement decrying the removal of information about HIV and people who are transgender. Access is ""critical to efforts to end the HIV epidemic,"" the organization's leaders said.A Bureau of Prisons web page originally titled ""Inmate Gender"" was relabeled ""Inmate Sex"" on Friday. A breakdown of transgender inmates in federal prisons was no longer included.The State Department on Friday removed the option to select ""X"" as a gender on passport applications for nonbinary applicants. It also replaced the word ""gender"" from the descriptor with the word ""sex.""All State Department employees were ordered to remove gender-specific pronouns from their email signatures. The directive, from the acting head of the Bureau of Management, said this was required to comply with Trump's executive orders and that the department was also removing all references to ""gender ideology"" from websites and internal documents.""All employees are required to remove any gender identifying pronouns from email signature blocks by 5:00 PM today,"" said the order from Tibor Nagy. ""Your cooperation is essential as we navigate these changes together.""An official from the U.S. Agency for International Development said staffers were directed to flag the use of the word ""gender"" in each of thousands of award contracts. Warnings against gender discrimination are standard language in every such contract. The official spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal, under a Trump administration gag order prohibiting USAID staffers from speaking with people outside their agency.The official said staffers fear that programs and jobs related to inclusion efforts, gender issues and issues specific to women are being singled out and possibly targeted under two Trump executive orders.Some Census Bureau and National Park Service pages were also inaccessible or giving error messages.Trump's executive order, signed on his first day back in office, calls for the federal government to define sex as only male or female and for that to be reflected on official documents such as passports and policies such as federal prison assignments.Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered the military to immediately stop recognizing identity a day before the start of February's Black History Month, saying they ""erode camaraderie and threaten mission execution.""","Some parts of government websites appeared with the message: ""The page you're looking for was not found"" The State Department on Friday removed the option to select ""X"" as a gender on passport applications for nonbinary applicants.

Ochoa, Commander, 89th Airlift Wing, before he boards Air Force One at Joint Base Andrews, Md., Friday, January 31, 2025. (AP)

WASHINGTON: The Trump White House issued a proclamation Friday recognizing February as Black History Month around the same time the Defense Department issued guidance declaring ""identity months dead.""The conflicting messages came as President Donald Trump has been targeting diversity, equity and inclusion programs for removal in the first weeks of his administration. He has referred to DEI initiatives as ""discrimination"" and insisted that the country must instead move toward a merit-based society.The White House proclamation calls for ""public officials, educators, librarians, and all the people of the United States to observe this month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities,"" though there is no elaboration on what constitutes ""appropriate.""A news release from the Defense Department titled ""Identity Months Dead at DOD"" says official resources, including working hours, will no longer be used to mark cultural awareness months. Black History Month, Women's History Month and National Disability Employment Awareness Month were among the events listed as now barred.""We are proud of our warriors and their history, but we will focus on the character of their service instead of their immutable characteristics,"" the Defense Department release read.In his first two weeks in office, Trump has moved to end affirmative action in federal contracting and directed that all federal DEI workers be put on paid leave before eventually being laid off. On Thursday, hours after a midair collision between a military helicopter and an American Airlines plane killed 67 people just miles from the White House, Trump baselessly blamed diversity initiatives for undermining air safety, despite no evidence of that.Gerald Ford in 1976 became the first president to issue a message recognizing February as Black History Month. Since then, presidents have made annual proclamations marking the month as a celebration of Black history, culture and education.Trump's proclamation Friday specifically noted the contributions of abolitionists Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman, conservative economist Thomas Sowell and Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. It said their achievements ""have monumentally advanced the tradition of equality under the law in our great country"" and are a continued inspiration.The declaration also listed golfer Tiger Woods as an American great, saying he was among those who have ""pushed the boundaries of excellence in their respective fields, paving the way for others to follow.""""This National Black History Month, as America prepares to enter a historic Golden Age,"" the proclamation said, ""I want to extend my tremendous gratitude to black Americans for all they have done to bring us to this moment, and for the many future contributions they will make as we advance into a future of limitless possibility under my Administration.""","The White House proclamation calls for ""public officials, educators, librarians, and all the people of the United States to observe this month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities"" A news release from the Defense Department titled ""Identity Months Dead at DOD"" says official resources will no longer be used to mark cultural awareness months.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117809614,imgsize-861458,width-400,resizemode-4/117809614.jpg"

List of things to become costly



Justin Trudeau's 'outlandish' remarks



Amid reports that Donald Trump may delay the proposed tariff on Canada and Mexico and may defer it to March 1, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt announced that the tariffs are coming tomorrow, February 1, as announced earlier. ""The tariffs are incoming tomorrow on Canada and Mexico. Both have allowed an invasion of fentanyl and illegal criminals that are killing American citizens,"" Leavitt said.Trump announced 25 per cent tariffs on Mexico and Canada as well as a 10 per cent duty on China and they were scheduled to start from the weekend. However, the White House did not provide details of how these levies will be meted out.The proposed tariffs could hike the price of a gallon of gasoline for some drivers by as much as 70 cents and could also affect grocery bills, ABC News reported citing experts. Tariffs of this magnitude would likely increase prices paid by US shoppers, since importers typically pass along a share of the cost of those higher taxes to consumers, experts said. The policy could raise prices for an array of products ranging from tomatoes to tequila to auto parts, the report said.GasTomatoes, avocadoesCars and auto partsTrump’s proposed tariffs could add $272 billion a year to tax burdens, according to Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Corpay Cross-Border Solutions. The Peterson Institute has estimated Trump’s proposed tariffs would cost the typical US household over $2,600 a year, CNN reported.A day before the tariffs are implemented, Justin Trudeau said Canada is also ready with counter-tariffs which he said is a ""purposeful, forceful but reasonable and immediate response"". Trudeau said his government was already looking into the concerns that Trump expressed.Leavitt reacted to Trudeau's comments and said it would be wise for Trudeau to talk to Trump directly before making such ""outlandish comments"" to the media.""The tariffs are incoming tomorrow on Canada. The reason for that is because both Canada and Mexico have allowed an unprecedented invasion of illegal fentanyl that is killing American citizens and also illegal immigrants into our country...

"Blackhawk Crash Pilot: Who is Jo Ellis, a trans soldier, who claims she's alive and was not flying the DC Blackhawk helicopter?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-jo-ellis-a-trans-soldier-who-claims-shes-alive-and-was-not-flying-the-dc-blackhawk-helicopter/articleshow/117797682.cms,"Jo Ellis, a Blackhawk pilot, issued a statement that she was not there in the army helicopter that crashed in DC.

What was the misinformation around Joe Ellis?



Who is Jo Ellis?



'Blackhawk took a bizarre flight path'



After President Donald Trump blamed the DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) hiring policies of the Obama and Biden governments for the tragic mid-air collision between a Blackhawk and an American Airlines plane and an army helicopter, rumors spread that one of the pilots of the helicopter was a transgender person -- Jo Ellis. This was to connect Donald Trump's reasoning with the mishap -- until Jo Ellis issued a video claiming that she is indeed a Blackhawk pilot, but is alive and was not flying the ill-fated helicopter.""Interesting morning. This is Jo Ellis. I am a Blackhawk pilot with the Virginia Army National Guard. I understand some people have associated me with the crash in DC and that is false. It is insulting to the families to try to tie this to some kind of political agenda, They don't deserve that. I don't deserve this. And I hope you all know that I am alive and well and this should be sufficient for you all to end all the rumors,"" she said adding a statement that the Department of Defense handles casualty notifications and confirmed that no Virginia National Guard personnel were involved in the Black Hawk collision.Jo Ellis' social media posts were scanned after she was mistakenly identified as one of the pilots. Keen-eyed social media users found out that Ellis wrote many anti-Trump statements. ""Just ONE DAY before piloting the Blackhawk that collided mid-air with a passenger jet over DC, transgender military pilot Joe Ellis appeared on the Michael Smerconish podcast. In the interview, Ellis expressed anger over Trump’s ban on trans service members, calling it a direct threat to a career in the military,"" one social media post claimed asking whether the DC crash was ""another trans terrorist attack"" and whether Ellis crashed into the jet on purpose.""So now we’re learning that the Pilot/Co-Pilot ‘female’ who was on the Blackhawk is actually a transgender who wrote a long letter ONE DAY PRIOR about “Gender dysphoria” and depression,"" another post read.Ellis is a Chief Warrant Officer and Black Hawk helicopter pilot who has served in the Virginia National Guard for 15 years, reports said. She served in combat zones in Iraq, along with other operations overseas. She serves in the military part-time, and also works as an IT engineer in the private sector.Ellis began her gender transitioning in 2023 while serving in the Army and claimed that everyone in her unit was very supportive.Though the investigation is on, prima facie the army helicopter is being blamed for taking a bizarre flight path deviating from its scheduled route and also altitude. President Donald Trump this morning took to Truth Social claiming that the Blackhawk was flying higher than its 200-ft limit. A New York Times report said the helicopter pilot even confirmed seeing the American Airlines plane and the air traffic controller asked the pilot to go behind the plane but it did not follow that.","Jo Ellis, a Blackhawk pilot, issued a statement that she was not there in the army helicopter that crashed in DC.

Top priority for Trump

WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump sent an envoy Friday to Venezuela to warn leftist leader Nicolas Maduro to accept the unconditional return of deported Venezuelans or face consequences.Richard Grenell, an outspoken ally of Trump who serves in a broad role as envoy for special missions, traveled to Caracas to speak to Maduro as the new administration vows to push a hard line.""President Trump expects Nicolas Maduro to take back all of the Venezuelan criminals and gang members that have been exported to the United States, and to do so unequivocally and without condition,"" said Mauricio Claver-Carone, the US special envoy for Latin America.He said that Grenell was also demanding that ""American hostages need to be released immediately, unequivocally.""""All I would do on this call is urge the Maduro government the Maduro regi in Venezuela, to heed to special envoy Ric Grenell and to his demands and what he puts on the table, because ultimately, there will be consequences otherwise,"" Claver-Carone told reporters.Venezuela's communication minister, Freddy Nanez, confirmed on Telegram that Maduro accepted a meeting with Grenell but suggested that the Venezuelan side did not expect agreements.It would be one of the first known meetings by the second Trump administrations with a government it considers hostile since the inauguration.Maduro was recently sworn in for a third term despite widespread international concerns about irregularities in the election.Claver-Carone said that the talks did not imply any softening of position on Maduro.The previous administration of Joe Biden agreed to relax sanctions on oil as part of a deal for American prisoners and free elections.Venezuela freed 10 Americans in a swap. But Biden reimposed sanctions after Maduro did not follow suit on democracy demands.Maduro recently announced the capture of seven ""mercenaries"" and said two were US citizens.""This is not a quid pro quo, is not a negotiation in exchange for anything. President Trump himself has made very clear we don't need Venezuelan oil,"" Claver-Carone said.Trump has made deporting undocumented people in the United States a top priority. During his campaign, he described immigrants as ""poisoning the blood"" of the United States.Since his return, he has pressed countries to take back deportees a top priority for secretary of state Marco Rubio as he starts a five-nation tour of Latin America on Saturday.In his first week back in the White House, Trump vowed crushing tariffs on Colombia, a longstanding US ally, after its president called for more humane treatment of repatriated citizens.The Trump administration quickly ended protections from deportation for more than 600,000 Venezuelans living in the United States under protected status.The Biden administration had allowed them to stay due to the fears for their safety if they return to Venezuela.Trump also signed a law making it easier to detain migrants who commit crimes, named after 22-year-old Laken Riley, a nursing student murdered by an undocumented Venezuelan migrant who had been arrested twice but released before her killing.The Venezuelan opposition, whose candidate was identified by both the Trump and Biden administrations as the rightful winner of last year's presidential election , criticized the ending of the protections, saying that the vast majority of the Venezuelans in the United States were ""honest and hard-working"" and forced to flee by Maduro.Grenell, a prolific user of social media, in Trump's first term served as acting director of national intelligence and ambassador to Germany, where he generated controversy with posts in support of Europe's populist right.","Richard Grenell, an outspoken ally of Trump, traveled to Caracas to speak to Maduro.

US policy shift and review timeline



Economic and social consequences for Pakistan



Geopolitical ramifications



Uncertain future for development initiatives



NEW DELHI: Donald Trump has temporarily suspended United States foreign assistance to foreign countries, including Pakistan, for re-evaluation, putting several critical development projects on hold.The decision follows an executive order issued by President Donald Trump, directing a comprehensive review of US foreign aid spending.The US aid suspension is set to impact several key sectors in Pakistan, including energy, economic growth, agriculture, governance, education, health, and cultural preservation. Projects such as the Power Sector Improvement Activity, Pakistan Private Sector Energy Initiative, and Clean Energy Loan Portfolio Guarantee Program face disruptions in the energy sector, as per a Geo news report.Economic growth initiatives, including the Social Protection Activity and Pakistan Private Investment Initiative, may also suffer setbacks. In agriculture, programmes like Water Management for Enhanced Productivity and Recharge Pakistan risk losing funding.The suspension has stalled numerous USAID-funded projects across various sectors, including health, education, agriculture, energy, and governance. The move halts initiatives such as the Ambassadors Fund for Cultural Preservation (AFCP), the Power Sector Improvement Activity, and the Pakistan Private Sector Energy Activity. Economic growth initiatives, such as the Social Protection Activity and Investment Promotion Activity, are also affected.In the education sector, projects aimed at improving girls' education, strengthening higher education systems, and enhancing resilience in Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have been disrupted. The health sector has also taken a hit, with the suspension of tuberculosis treatment programmes, family health initiatives, and global health security efforts.Tammy Bruce, a spokesperson for the US Department of State, confirmed that all foreign aid funded by the State Department and USAID is under review. Secretary of State Marco Rubio justified the move, stating that every aid dollar must contribute to American security, strength, and prosperity.The White House has clarified that the suspension is temporary, with a 90-day review period. The final decision will be made by the relevant departments in consultation with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).The suspension of aid threatens Pakistan’s development trajectory, particularly in regions relying on US-funded initiatives for stability and growth. The decision could delay infrastructural advancements, limit economic opportunities, and disrupt healthcare access for vulnerable populations.Pakistan’s governance and democracy-building programmes are also affected, including projects on electoral reforms, land registration, and local governance. The decision may weaken institutional development efforts and impede progress in human rights and civic participation.The suspension highlights a shift in US-Pakistan relations , with Washington reassessing its financial commitments to Islamabad. Analysts believe this could push Pakistan to seek alternative funding sources, possibly from China or Gulf nations, altering its geopolitical alliances.While the pause in aid does not signify a complete severance of US-Pakistan ties, it raises concerns about future diplomatic engagements and financial support from Washington. The upcoming review will determine whether these programmes will resume, be modified, or face permanent cuts.With crucial projects now in limbo, Pakistani officials and aid-dependent communities await the US review’s outcome. The next three months will be critical in determining whether Washington reinstates its financial commitments or signals a long-term reduction in aid to Pakistan.For now, the suspension leaves Pakistan navigating an uncertain future, with potential setbacks in economic growth, infrastructure development, and humanitarian assistance.","Donald Trump has temporarily suspended United States foreign assistance to foreign countries, including Pakistan.

LONDON: Baloch leader Hyrbyair Marri brought attention to the ongoing horrors that the Pashtun and Baloch communities endure under Pakistan 's repressive control in a stirring statement to the Pashtun National Council (Jirga). Marri brought attention to the Pakiststate's systematic exploitation, enforced disappearances, and violence against various ethnic communities.""The sufferings of the Baloch and Pashtun under Pakistan's occupation are countless and unending,"" Marri stated, emphasizing the urgent need for unity between the two nations to resist colonial oppression.He recalled previous instances of solidarity, such as the treaty of kalat in 1758, in which Afghan and Baloch leaders promised to respect and support one another. He asked both groups to rekindle this spirit in their struggle for independence.Marri compared British imperialism to the colonial strategies that Pakistan acquired. He denounced Pakistan's continuous military actions in Balochistan , pointing to unlawful executions, torture, and enforced disappearances as means of quelling dissent. The Baloch leader cited the targeted profiling of Pashtuns and killings like the 1948 Barbra event in Charsadda, claiming that these practices were continuations of the British heritage of divide and conquer.Recalling how Pashtun tribes were utilized as frontline combatants in 1948 while Punjabi elites remained behind, he also denounced Pakistan's abuse of Baloch and Pashtun youth. He also drew attention to the fact that thousands of Baloch youths were forcibly drafted into the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s and sent to die under pretences of religious salvation.Marri condemned Pakistan's racial profiling of Afghan refugees, primarily Pashtuns, and their forced deportation as a pressure tactic against Afghanistan. ""These people have lived here for generations, yet they are treated as disposable,"" he said.Calling for a renewed alliance between the Baloch and Pashtun nations, Marri declared, ""Our unity is the path to freedom.

He sentenced the four men to death and also fined them 4.6 million Pakistani rupees (approximately $16,000). They were identified as Rana Usman, Ashfaque Ali, Salman Sajjad, and Wajid Ali.According to the court order, dated Jan 24, the four individuals were sentenced to death by hanging for using derogatory remarks against the Holy Prophet. They were also sentenced to life in prison for defiling the Holy Quran and to 10 years’ imprisonment for deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs. “All the sentences shall run concurrently,” the order read.The prosecution lawyer said the case was supported by forensic evidence from the devices used. The men’s lawyer, Manzoor Rahmani, criticised the court’s order, saying doubts and uncertainties that arise in such cases are ignored by the courts, likely due to fear of a religious backlash and potential mob violence against the judge if the accused is acquitted.“We are preparing our appeals against the decision and will go to the high court,” Rahmani said. A member of a support group formed by the families of the accused was quoted by media as saying the pattern of arrests and prosecutions in this case was consistent with previous ones.“We urge the government to establish a commission to investigate the rise in these cases before these young individuals spend the best years of their lives behind bars,” said the support group member.Critics say blasphemy accusations, whether true or false, often lead to lengthy prison sentences on death row and solitary confinement. The laws, according to them, are often abused to settle scores or used to target members of Pakistan’s religious minorities.Hundreds of people have been accused of blasphemy since the draconian laws were introduced by former dictator Gen Zia-ul-Haq in the 1980s. Nearly 100 people have been reportedly lynched to death so far while dozens remain on death row.",A Pakistani court has sentenced four men to death on blasphemy charges.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan jailed former prime minister Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi , on Monday challenged in a high court their conviction in the Al-Qadir Trust case . An accountability court in Islamabad convicted the former first couple in the high-profile 190 million British Pounds case in a much-anticipated ruling earlier this month.As already indicated by the party, their lawyers filed an appeal in the Islamabad High Court (IHC) against the conviction and sentence, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf said in a WhatsApp message.""Legal Team representing Imran Khan & Bushra BiBi, challenges Al-Qadir Trust case decision at IHC,"" the party said, adding that the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) ""maliciously misused its authority by announcing sentence, with incomplete investigation"".It further stated that the decision to approach the high court was taken to annul the decision and order acquittal of the former first couple.Judge Nasir Javed Rana of anti-corruption court announced the reserved verdict on January 17, convicting Khan and his wife Bibi guilty of corruption in the case and sentencing them to 14 and seven years respectively in prison.The NAB, the top anti-corruption body, in December 2023 had filed the case against Khan, Bibi and six others, accusing them of causing loss to the tune of Rs 50 billion to the national kitty.However, only the former first couple has been prosecuted as all others, including a property tycoon, were out of the country.The case was based on the charge that an amount of Rs 50 billion (190 million pound), returned to Pakistan by the UK's National Crime Agency as part of a settlement with a property tycoon was misused.The funds were reportedly intended for the national treasury but were allegedly redirected for personal benefit of the businessman who helped Bibi and Khan to set up a university.Bibi, as a trustee of the Al-Qadir Trust, was accused of benefiting from this settlement, including acquiring 458 kanals of land for Al-Qadir University in Jhelum.","Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, have been convicted of corruption.

A Pakistani court on Monday awarded death penalty to four men for ""online blasphemy"" against the Prophet Mohammed and the Islamic holy book Quran.The four were charged with spreading blasphemous content online against Prophet Mohammed and the Islamic holy book.""They were sentenced to death... on Friday for spreading blasphemous content online against the Prophet Mohammed and the Quran,"" Rao Abdur Raheem, a lawyer from the legal commission on blasphemy Pakistan, a private group which brought the case to court, told news agency AFP.""Our case was supported by forensic evidence from the devices used in this heinous act,"" he added.The four men were sentenced in Rawalpindi, the garrison city that neighbours the capital Islamabad.A member of a support group formed by the families, however, said to AFP that they would challenge the conviction.""The pattern of arrests and prosecutions in this case is consistent with previous ones,"" said the support group member, who spoke on condition of anonymity told the news agency.""We urge the government to establish a commission to investigate the rise in these cases before these young individuals spend the best years of their lives behind bars,"" the member added.Blasphemy laws in Pakistan are among the strictest in the world, carrying severe punishments, including the death penalty, for offences against Islam.These laws, primarily enshrined in Sections 295-298 of the Pakistan Penal Code, criminalise acts such as insulting the Prophet Muhammad, desecrating the Quran, or offending religious sentiments.These laws have often been criticised for being misused to target minorities, settle personal disputes, and incite mob violence. The lack of safeguards against false accusations has led to numerous cases where individuals face imprisonment, violence, or even extrajudicial killings without substantial evidence.The blasphemy laws have sparked national and international debates about human rights and freedom of expression in Pakistan.Activists argue that these laws suppress religious minorities, limit free speech, and create a climate of fear, while conservative groups strongly defend them as essential to protecting Islam.High-profile cases, such as those of Asia Bibi and Salman Taseer, have highlighted the deep divisions in Pakistani society regarding these laws. Successive governments have been reluctant to amend or repeal the legislation due to the risk of backlash from religious hardliners. As a result, blasphemy remains a highly sensitive issue, with calls for legal reforms often met with strong resistance.","Pakistani court awards death penalty to four men for ""online blasphemy"" against the Prophet Mohammed and the Islamic holy book Quran.

Six of the petitioners appeared in court on Friday after the case was set for hearing.They claimed that it was the responsibility of the respondents to protect and provide a safe environment for all foreign citizens legally staying and investing in the country, including the petitioners.The petitioners said the Sindh police had engaged in repeated acts of harassment over the last six to seven months, including unwarrantedly restricting movement of Chinese nationals in Karachi and Sindh and unjustified detentions within their residences on the pretext of “security issues” without any clear legal grounds or specific incidents to justify such actions.They also claimed that the policemen stationed at their homes literally locked them in and restricted their movement within the confines of their houses, and that when the petitioners bowed to their illegal demands of paying Pakistani Rs 30,000 ($110) to Rs 50,000 ($182), they were let go.The petitioners also stated that officers from Sukhan police station (in Sindh) had recently sealed seven industrial units of other Chinese nationals without prior notice, citing security reasons.They added that their problems began when they arrived at the airport where officials refused to let them enter the country unless they were bribed, despite having all legally required papers.They also accused police of allegedly throwing stones at their vehicles and smashing the rear screens of their cars, and that the deployed policemen appeared indecent and unprofessionally trained. They cited complaints against them for disturbing privacy and demanding tips ranging from Pakistani Rs 15,000 ($55) to Rs 50,000 ($182).The petition also referenced an incident in which three Chinese female investors were forced to return to China after being treated disrespectfully at a Karachi expo centre.

COLOMBO: Sri Lanka announced the lifting of a five-year ban on vehicle imports Tuesday as the country showed further signs of emerging from its worst economic meltdown.Information minister Nalinda Jayatissa said buses, trucks and utility vehicles will be allowed in from Saturday under a phased removal of restrictions in place since 2020.""We are moving very cautiously because we don't want a surge of imports that will deplete our foreign reserves,"" Jayatissa told reporters in Colombo.""Depending on the demand, we will open imports of other categories of vehicles such as cars, motorcycles and three-wheelers.""He said the imports were necessary to generate much-needed tax revenue, and the government hoped to cap imports at about $1.2 billion this year.Current tax rates on vehicles are over 300 per cent.Sri Lanka spent $1.4 billion on vehicle imports in 2019, the last full year before the import ban was imposed in March 2020.The island nation earlier attempted to end the ban on commercial vehicle imports in August 2023, but importers were unable to open letters of credit while the country was still in default on its foreign debt.Sri Lanka formally ended its status as a bankrupt nation in December after securing debt restructuring deals with both bilateral and private creditors.Sri Lanka defaulted on its $46 billion external debt in April 2022 as the country ran out of foreign exchange to finance imports, causing painful shortages of food, fuel and medicines.Months of street protests led to the toppling of then-president Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who was accused of corruption and mismanagement.His successor secured a bailout loan from the international monetary fund , which has said that the South Asian nation is making a recovery but is still not out of the woods.","Buses, trucks and utility vehicles will be allowed in from Saturday under a phased removal of restrictions in place since 2020.

Why is poliovirus spreading from Afghanistan to Pakistan?



Getting back to successful mass polio immunization programs



Bhutta: Work with the Taliban on polio eradication



Before the development of the first poliovirus vaccine in 1955, poliomyelitis paralysed and killed up to half a million people every year.By 2000, mass vaccination campaigns, armed with new types of oral polio vaccines, had almost eradicated wild poliovirus, except for a few isolated regions.In 2020, the whole African region was declared free of wild poliovirus, leaving just two countries yet to stop the spread of the disease: Afghanistan and Pakistan.Mass immunization programs had Pakistan on the brink of eradicating polio in 2023, with just six remaining cases of the wild form of the virus. But now, cases are climbing again — 73 cases were reported in 2024.""It has spread to all districts of Pakistan. We've snatched defeat from the jaws of victory,"" said Zulfiqar Bhutta , Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada.The reason, Bhutta writes in a commentary in the Lancet, is that cases of poliovirus are spilling over the border from Afghanistan. The genetic strains of wild poliovirus in Pakistan are all from Afghanistan.Bhutta leads groups working on child immunization strategies in conflict zones. He was involved in the largest trials of poliovirus vaccine interventions in Afghanistan, working ""very successfully"" with the Taliban until a year ago.But poliovirus eradication programs have faced multiple setbacks over the years since the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in 2021. Public health officials say "" vaccine hesitancy "" (when people don't want to take vaccines), poor sanitary conditions and regional insecurity have all sabotaged vaccination efforts.Bhutta, who was back in Afghanistan in December, said the Taliban did not allow female health professionals to work, and that impedes public programs, including vaccinations.""Some health workers have got into the communities. But they've somehow dispersed the goddamn poliovirus over the entire area,"" Bhutta said.Now, health authorities do not have reliable data on the number of poliovirus cases in Afghanistan. The poliovirus can cause paralysis in extreme cases, especially young children, and can be fatal if the virus affects breathing muscles.""It's a virus that does not want to be eradicated, so give it an inch and it will take a yard,"" Bhutta said.Pakistan has spent an estimated $10 billion on poliovirus immunization programs in the region since 2011. Despite two decades of challenges, including political instability, drone strikes in its tribal areas, and conflict in Afghanistan, the program almost succeeded in completely eradicating polio within Pakistan's borders.But provinces in Pakistan have different immunization rates. While in Punjab, 85% of children are vaccinated, rates are as low as 30% in Balochistan. Until vaccine coverage reaches 85-90% in all provinces, it is unlikely wild poliovirus will be fully eradicated from the region.Bhutta is calling for a major strategic review to strengthen routine immunization programs, not just for polio, but for other infectious diseases, as well.""This is how countries like India eradicated polio,"" Bhutta said. ""They strengthened their routine immunization programs at the same time.""""It can certainly work in Pakistan,"" Bhutta said. ""It's a question of where you want to put resources.""Eradicating poliovirus in the region is impossible, Bhutta said, unless international and Pakistan-based health authorities work with the Taliban government in Afghanistan — which they don't at the moment. Until then, cases will continue to spill over the border, he said.International health agencies have worked with the Taliban before to deliver smallpox vaccines during periods of negotiated peace, when health workers could go in and give the vaccine.""Taliban are not the enemy. Ultimately, they have the same health concerns that everyone else does,"" Bhutta said.What's crucial to eradicate polio in the region, he said, is to address general health programs for women and children, not just polio. Without proper sanitation and broader disease prevention programs, polio will just come back.According to data from the WHO, suspected cases of several infectious diseases, including pneumonia, dengue fever and measles, have been rising in Afghanistan in the last six months.""There are so many health needs in this region, needs for children with malnutrition, needs for children with disease prevention and management. To go in and say all we want to do is polio, does not make sense,"" Bhutta said.","Polio has spread to all districts of Pakistan. The genetic strains of wild poliovirus in Pakistan are all from Afghanistan. Until vaccine coverage reaches 85-90% in all provinces, it is unlikely wild pol Giovirus will be fully eradicated from the region.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117543630,imgsize-1272268,width-400,resizemode-4/117543630.jpg"
Taliban Persecution Of Women: Taliban reject court move to arrest top officials for persecuting Afghan women and girls,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/taliban-reject-court-move-to-arrest-top-officials-for-persecuting-afghan-women-and-girls/articleshow/117521486.cms,"Taliban reject court move to arrest top officials for persecuting Afghan women and girls (Picture credit: AP)

The Taliban on Friday rejected a court move to arrest two of their top officials for persecuting women, accusing the court of baseless accusations and misbehaviour.The International Criminal Court 's chief prosecutor Karim Khan announced Thursday he had requested arrest warrants for two top Taliban officials, including the leader Hibatullah Akhundzada.Since they took back control of the country in 2021, the Taliban have barred women from jobs, most public spaces and education beyond sixth grade.A foreign ministry statement condemned the ICC request.The court was making baseless accusations against Afghanistan's leadership at a time of peace in the country and people had ""breathed a sigh of relief.""The ministry alleged the court had turned a blind eye to decades of war and crimes against humanity committed by foreign forces and their allies. ""This misbehaviour further destroys the weak credibility of the said structure (ICC) and makes its status and position at the international level completely meaningless,"" the statement said.The ministry warned the court against imposing its interpretation of human rights and ignoring the religious and national values of others.Earlier Friday, an Afghan women's group had hailed the court's move.The Afghan Women's Movement for Justice and Awareness celebrated the ICC decision and called it a ""great historical achievement.""""We consider this achievement a symbol of the strength and will of Afghan women and believe this step will start a new chapter of accountability and justice in the country,"" the group said.An official in the former Western-backed administration said the Taliban leadership was likely to exploit the decision for propaganda purposes by framing it as proof of their strong faith and resilience.""They may tell their followers that their beliefs are so powerful they have provoked the collective opposition of global powers,"" Mohammad Halim Fidai said on the X platform. Fidai was a governor of four provinces before the Taliban takeover in August 2021 and now lives outside Afghanistan. ""This decision could inadvertently serve as a badge of honor or credibility for them.""Also Friday, the UN mission in Afghanistan said it was a ""tragedy and travesty"" that girls remain deprived of education.""It has been 1,225 days - soon to be four years - since authorities imposed a ban that prevents girls above the age of 12 from attending school,"" said the head of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, Roza Otunbayeva. ""It is a travesty and tragedy that millions of Afghan girls have been stripped of their right to education.""Afghanistan is the only country in the world that explicitly bars women and girls from all levels of education, said Otunbayeva.","Taliban reject court move to arrest top officials for persecuting Afghan women and girls.

Bangladesh says it won't bail out factories linked to Sheikh Hasina,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-says-it-wont-bail-out-factories-linked-to-sheikh-hasina/articleshow/117520609.cms,"Former Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina (Credits: ANI)

DHAKA: Bangladesh's interim government has said it will not bail out garment factories linked to a senior ally of autocratic ex-premier Sheikh Hasina , a move set to throw thousands out of work.Beximco, the South Asian nation's largest conglomerate, operates more than a dozen garment factories collectively employing more than 40,000 people in Bangladesh's key export industry.Its detained co-founder Salman F Rahman was a close adviser to Hasina, who fled the country in August following the student-led revolution that toppled her government.Work at Beximco's factories has since ground to a halt and employees have staged protests demanding the caretaker government come to their rescue.""We have no other option but to fully shut down the factories as the government cannot manage them,"" Sakhawat Hossain, the interim government's labour minister, told a news conference late on Thursday.""The workers' request to nationalise the factories is also not feasible,"" he said, urging workers to seek employment elsewhere.The government has blamed Beximco's monumental unpaid loan balance as the reason behind its refusal to take over the conglomerate.Bangladesh's central bank has valued the firm's outstanding loans and liabilities at more than $4.1 billion.""The government considered resuming operations at the factories, viewing them as national assets with significant involvement in employment and exports,"" commerce minister Sheikh Bashir Uddin told reporters.""Despite the substantial amount of defaulted loans, we approached the issue with compassion. However, we have not received sufficient cooperation from the owners.""Rahman was taken into custody shortly after Hasina fled to neighbouring India, where she has remained since her ouster.Abdul Qaiyum, a senior officer of the Beximco Industrial Park, said the conglomerate's bank accounts had been frozen, preventing work at the factories.""We need some loans,"" he told AFP.Beximco had requested a bridging loan of around $33 million to continue operating, according to Bangladeshi newspaper reports.Workers at the firm's factories took to the streets on Wednesday to demand the government help save their jobs, vandalising numerous vehicles in their protest.Sakhawat said the government had paid the salaries of Beximco workers up to the end of December and would ensure they receive other benefits.""Those involved in vandalism will face consequences,"" he said.","Bangladesh's interim government will not bail out garment factories linked to a senior ally of autocratic ex-premier Sheikh Hasina.

Pakistan to create new paramilitary force ahead of protests by Imran Khan’s party,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-to-create-new-paramilitary-force-ahead-of-protests-by-imran-khans-party/articleshow/122480047.cms,"The announcement came after PTI party said it would stage nationwide protests starting on Aug 5, the second anniversary of Imran Khan’s arrest





ISLAMABAD: Pakistan said on Monday it was creating a national paramilitary force, prompting concern among opposition parties and human rights groups that it could be used as a tool of political repression.The move turns an existing paramilitary force deployed on Pakistan’s northwestern border with Afghanistan into a national security force that will be called the Federal Constabulary, state minister for the interior Talal Chaudhry told a press conference in the eastern city of Faisalabad. Its new duties will include internal security, riot control and counter-terrorism, according to a copy of the amended law reported by the local Dunya News TV.The announcement came after Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party of former jailed PM Imran Khan said it would stage nationwide protests starting on Aug 5, the second anniversary of his arrest. Several such protests since his Aug 2023 arrest have turned violent, in some cases paralysing the capital Islamabad for days.“This will be a new force. This will be a stronger force. We need this force for internal security,” Chaudhry said, adding that President Asif Ali Zardari had already approved amendments in the law introducing changes in the paramilitary force.The new force replaces the Frontier Constabulary (FC), whose cadres were previously recruited only from tribes in the northwestern province, Chaudhry said.Training of the new force will bring it into line with other national law enforcement agencies, he added. Khan’s party spokesperson Zulfikar Bukhari said the changes should be subject to parliamentary discussion.The new force “should not be used as a gimmick to silence political opponents, as has been previously witnessed when the government applied such laws against a large number of the PTI leadership and supporters,” he said. His concern was echoed by Haris Khalique, secretary of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, an independent body. “We are alarmed by the changes being made to the security and law enforcement structure of the country without any debate in parliament,” Khalique said.REUTERS","The move turns an existing paramilitary force deployed on Pakistan’s northwestern border with Afghanistan into a national security force.

Chinese university expels woman for 'improper contact' with a foreigner,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/chinese-university-expels-woman-for-improper-contact-with-a-foreigner/articleshow/122479526.cms,"This is an AI-generated image, used for representational purposes only.





A Chinese university said that it would expel a student because she had had ""improper contact with a foreigner"" and ""damaged national dignity,"" after videos circulated online that suggested she had been intimate with a Ukrainian video gamer.The announcement set off heated debate in China. Some commentators applauded the decision and said that Chinese people, particularly women, were too enamoured of foreigners. But others said the expulsion smacked of sexism and paternalism, and compared it to examples of people accused of rape or sexual harassment on campus who had been punished more lightly.Many also criticised the university, Dalian Polytechnic University, in northeastern China, for publicly shaming the student by posting its expulsion notice on its website last week and identifying the student by her full name.""If there is anyone who truly undermined national dignity in this case, it was not the woman whose privacy rights were violated,"" Zhao Hong, a professor of law at Peking University in Beijing, wrote in an opinion column, ""but the online spectators who frantically humiliated an ordinary woman under the banner of so-called justice, and the educational institution that used stale moral commandments.""The university said the student's conduct, in an incident it said took place on Dec.16, had ""caused a negative impact."" It gave no details, but said the student was being punished in accordance with a university regulation about ""civic morality.""That regulation reads: ""Those who have improper contact with foreigners and damage the national dignity and the reputation of the school shall be given a demerit or above, depending on the circumstances.""Chinese social media users quickly linked the announcement to videos shared on that date by a Ukrainian professional video gamer, Danylo Teslenko, who goes by the nickname Zeus. Teslenko, who had been visiting Shanghai for an esports tournament, had posted videos of himself with a Chinese woman to his Telegram channel, where he currently has about 43,000 subscribers.Teslenko has since deleted the videos. Screenshots and recordings still circulating online show the two apparently in a hotel room, with the woman seemingly aware she is being filmed, but do not show any sexually explicit behaviour.In an emailed response to questions, Teslenko said that he deleted the videos when he realized they were spreading on Chinese social media. ""I understood that these clips, although not intimate in nature, were too personal and inappropriate for public sharing,"" he wrote. ""That was my mistake, and I sincerely apologize for it.""Teslenko also addressed the outcry in two posts on the social platform X on Sunday, after news of the expulsion spread. He wrote that he had believed he was sharing ""just a normal moment from life,"" not anything ""disrespectful.""But on Chinese social media, there was general agreement among commenters that there had been disrespect. The only question was by whom.Users who cheered the university's decision said that the woman had shamed China by making it seem as if Chinese women were promiscuous, especially with white men. A tech blogger with 14 million followers wrote on the platform Weibo that ""fawning over foreigners"" would never bring respect, and that ""some mistakes are unforgivable."" Some state media outlets also shared the woman's full name.But others asked why the vitriol seemed to be directed primarily at the woman, rather than at Teslenko, for sharing the videos. (Teslenko frequently makes crude jokes, including about women, online; in posts to his subscribers on Telegram accompanying the Shanghai videos he had indicated that he would show photos of her if his posts drew enough likes.)Other users criticised the university for trying to enforce outdated moral standards. According to the university regulations, other behavior that could lead to censure include listening to music too loudly and any premarital sexual activity.The woman could not be reached for comment. The university did not return requests for comment.Some people also pointed out that Chinese men who post on social media seeking or showing off Caucasian wives are often hailed as national heroes and paragons of masculinity. Others highlighted the case of a male student who was found guilty of rape and put on probation by his university, or that of a male professor who was allowed to keep teaching after sexually harassing students.Some prominent legal scholars encouraged the female student to sue the university for infringing on her rights to privacy and an education.""As an adult woman, whether she has a sexual relationship with others is entirely within her right to sexual autonomy,"" Zhao wrote.Some official media outlets also offered measured defenses of the woman. The Global Times, a tabloid controlled by the ruling Chinese Communist Party, wrote a commentary that said ""problem students"" should be ""guided to recognize their mistakes,"" but in private. Others noted that the expulsion was not final -- the notice said the student had 60 days to appeal but that the revelation of her identity was irreversible.","A Chinese university said it would expel a student because she had ""improper contact with a foreigner"" The announcement set off heated debate in China.

Israel's plan to permanently displace Palestinians threatens Gaza truce talks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/israels-plan-to-permanently-displace-palestinians-threatens-gaza-truce-talks/articleshow/122479679.cms,"Children queue with pots to receive meals from a charity kitchen in Gaza (NYT)





An Israeli proposal to force much of Gaza's population into a small zone in the territory's south has threatened to derail the latest effort to achieve a truce between Israel and Hamas.In recent weeks, Israeli officials have briefed journalists and foreign counterparts on a loose plan to force hundreds of thousands of Palestinian civilians into an area controlled by Israel's military close to the Gaza-Egypt border. Legal experts have warned that the plan would violate international law because the civilians would be barred from returning to their homes to the north, a restriction that would constitute a form of ethnic cleansing.While the Israeli govt has yet to formally announce or comment on the plan, the idea of a new encampment in southern Gaza was first proposed last week by Israel Katz, the Israeli defence minister. He discussed it at a briefing with Israeli correspondents who focus on military affairs, and NYT reviewed readouts of the briefing written by its attendees. Several attendees also wrote articles that attracted widespread attention among both Israelis and Palestinians.A spokesman for Katz declined to comment on the reports, as did the office of PM Netanyahu Now, Hamas has cited Katz's proposal as one of the latest obstacles to a new truce. During a ceasefire, in exchange for releasing roughly 25 hostages, Hamas wants Israeli troops to withdraw from much of Gaza. The new Israeli plan makes such an outcome far less likely, since it would ensure that Israeli troops remained in charge of a large area over which Hamas seeks to reestablish control.Husam Badran, a senior member of Hamas, described the establishment of the encampment as a ""deliberatively obstructive demand"" that would complicate the fraught negotiations. ""This would be an isolated city that resembles a ghetto,"" Badran said on Monday in a text message. ""This is utterly unacceptable, and no Palestinian would agree to this.""Hopes for an imminent truce rose last week after Netanyahu went to Washington for meetings with President Trump that many expected would result in an Israeli compromise.

The onboard systems quickly contained and extinguished the fire, but the crew deployed emergency slides to evacuate the roughly 50 passengers who were still on board, “out of an abundance of caution.”“No injuries have been reported, and the aircraft has been removed from service for maintenance,” a WestJet spokesperson said in a statement quoted by CTV News.Vancouver airport officials confirmed that fire rescue crews responded to the incident but were not required to intervene, as the plane’s internal safety systems handled the situation. Airport operations and flight schedules remained unaffected.The Transportation Safety Board of Canada has dispatched a team to investigate and assess the incident.","A WestJet flight from Tampa to Vancouver experienced a small engine fire upon arrival late Saturday night.

In a seismic decision that could redefine the limits of presidential power, the US Supreme Court has allowed President Donald Trump to effectively dismantle the Department of Education—firing more than 1,300 employees and gutting key civil rights protections—without a single vote from Congress. The move, effectively halving the department’s workforce, marks a dramatic escalation in the administration’s effort to shrink the federal role in American education.Here’s a breakdown of what the ruling means, how it happened, and what’s likely to come next.On July 14, the Supreme Court issued an unsigned emergency order allowing the Trump administration to proceed with firing over 1,300 employees at the Department of Education. That amounts to more than 50 percent of its staff. The order did not include a vote count or legal reasoning, which is typical for such applications.Justice Sonia Sotomayor dissented, joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, arguing that President Trump had no authority to unilaterally dismantle an agency created by Congress.On March 20, Trump signed an executive order directing Education Secretary Linda McMahon to begin dismantling the department.The order cited low test scores and bureaucratic inefficiency. McMahon claimed the plan would promote “efficiency and accountability” while returning education policymaking to the states.The department oversees college loans, enforces civil rights in schools, monitors academic performance, and supports students with disabilities. Critics argue its dismantling would erode all of these functions.The Department of Education was established by Congress in 1979. Under the US Constitution, only Congress can create or eliminate federal agencies. That’s the argument made by 21 Democratic state attorneys general, several school districts, and the American Federation of Teachers, who sued to block Trump’s executive order.In May, Judge Myong J. Joun of the District of Massachusetts ruled in their favour, ordering the reinstatement of fired workers. He held that Trump’s order amounted to an unconstitutional shutdown of a congressionally authorised agency. An appeals court upheld the ruling.The Trump administration appealed to the Supreme Court, which has now allowed the firings to proceed while the case continues.Before Trump returned to office, the department had over 4,000 employees. After the mass terminations, fewer than 2,000 remain. Particularly hard-hit is the Office for Civil Rights, with seven of its twelve regional offices closed.Administration officials insist that statutory duties will still be performed, but acknowledge that “many discretionary functions are better left to the states.”Justice Sotomayor warned the decision would cause “untold harm” to students, delaying or denying them educational opportunities and leaving them vulnerable to discrimination without federal enforcement mechanisms.“This isn’t streamlining. It’s sabotage,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. Sheria Smith, president of the Education Department workers’ union, called it “an effort to play with the futures of millions of Americans.”The court’s ruling reflects a broader expansion of executive power. Just last week, the justices allowed Trump to proceed with sweeping cuts across several other departments, including State, Treasury, and Housing and Urban Development.The Education Department case raises a crucial constitutional question: can a president sideline an entire agency without congressional approval, simply by gutting its personnel?If the answer is yes, it sets a precedent that future presidents — of either party — could use to shrink or even hollow out other federal departments without legislative input.Although the Supreme Court’s order is technically temporary, its effects are immediate. Workers who had been reinstated will now be terminated again. The department will continue to operate with a skeleton crew while the case plays out in court.Congress could intervene to limit or reverse the firings, but that appears unlikely in the current political climate. Republicans control the House, and Democrats have a slim majority in the Senate.The Supreme Court’s decision allows Donald Trump to execute his most radical reorganisation of the federal government to date. By hollowing out the Department of Education, he has advanced a long-standing conservative goal: returning control of schools to the states and curbing federal oversight. Supporters see it as overdue reform. Opponents see it as reckless and authoritarian. Either way, American education — and American governance — may never be the same.Yes — more than 1,300 jobs gone. The department is now running at half strength.Not officially. Only Congress can. But Trump is hollowing it out without technically ""abolishing"" it.Expect less oversight. Civil rights enforcement, special ed, and student loan support could take a big hit.Not yet. The Supreme Court ruling is temporary — but the damage may already be done.Opponents say Trump overstepped. Supporters say he’s just streamlining. Courts will decide.Democrats, teachers’ unions, civil rights groups — and three Supreme Court justices in dissent.Trump, his base, and anyone who wants to shrink the federal government.The department limps on, the lawsuits roll forward — and the precedent gets more dangerous by the day.","On July 14, the Supreme Court issued an unsigned emergency order allowing the Trump administration to proceed with firing over 1,300 employees at the Department of Education.

Legal challenges and local response







A major immigration raid at two marijuana farms in Southern California has resulted in more than 360 arrests, a death, and rising tensions between federal authorities and local officials.The operation took place last Thursday at Glass House Farms facilities in Camarillo and Carpinteria, northwest of Los Angeles.It has been described as one of the largest operations since President Donald Trump took office, according to the department of homeland security (DHS) secretary Kristi Noem.The DHS executed criminal search warrants at the two sites, with officers in tactical gear storming the greenhouses. The raids sparked confusion and fear among workers and nearby residents, many of whom gathered at the Camarillo location demanding information about their loved ones. One worker, 57-year-old Jaime Alanis, fell from a greenhouse roof while hiding and died two days later in hospital. His niece confirmed his death, noting that he had worked at the farm for a decade and was the sole provider for his wife and daughter in Mexico.Originally, federal officials said around 200 people had been arrested for alleged immigration violations. That number later increased to 361. Among those detained, four had prior convictions including rape and kidnapping.The federal government said it launched the raids to investigate suspected child labour, human trafficking , and abuse. DHS initially said 10 children were found on the property, later raising that number to 14. However, no charges have been filed, and the agency has not released details about the children, their ages, or their activities on site.Glass House Farms began in Carpinteria and later expanded to Camarillo, where it operates both cannabis and tomato greenhouses. State cannabis regulators said no minors were seen during a May inspection. Following a complaint, they reopened an investigation.The raids triggered protests, with tensions flaring between demonstrators and armed agents. Smoke filled the air as crowds clashed with authorities. Federal agents also arrested four US citizens accused of resisting or assaulting officers.The raids come amid growing backlash from immigrant advocates and local leaders. A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to halt broad immigration stops in seven California counties. The justice department has appealed, calling the order vague and difficult to enforce.Los Angeles mayor Karen Bass responded by signing an executive order to support affected communities. The city will work with partners to distribute emergency cash assistance through immigrant rights groups. The funds aim to support residents too scared to go to work or access public services. The city also plans to train staff and establish a police working group to prepare for future immigration actions.Officials say the federal government has not shared the full search warrant or offered evidence to back its claims of trafficking or abuse.","The operation took place last Thursday at Glass House Farms facilities in Camarillo and Carpinteria, northwest of Los Angeles.

'They just bombed a nursing home': Trump claims Melania's remarks pushed for stronger action on Russia; US president pledges billions for Ukraine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/they-just-bombed-a-nursing-home-trump-claims-melanias-remarks-pushed-for-stronger-action-on-russia-us-president-pledges-billions-for-ukraine/articleshow/122472961.cms,"



US President Donald Trump on Monday said that his wife and first lady, Melania, played a key role in pushing him to take a harder stance against Vladimir Putin over the Russia-Ukraine war.During a meeting with Nato secretary general Mark Rutte at the White House, Trump said Melania had questioned his optimistic view after his phone calls with Putin, who often promised peace talks.“I go home, I tell the first lady, ‘You know, I spoke to Vladimir today. We had a wonderful conversation.’ She said, ‘Oh, really? Another city was just hit,” Trump was quoted as saying to reporters. He added that her reaction contributed to his decision to ramp up military support for Ukraine and put pressure on Moscow, reports the New York Post.“We thought we had a deal numerous times,” Trump was quoted as saying to the Daily Beast. “I get home, I’d say, ‘First Lady, I had the most wonderful talk with Vladimir. I think we’re finished.’ And then I’d turn on the television or she’ll say to me one time, ‘Well that’s strange because they just bombed a nursing home.’”Trump announced that he would commit “billions of dollars” in weapons to Ukraine and warned that his administration would impose harsh tariffs on Russia if there was no ceasefire agreement within 50 days.“We’re going to be doing very severe tariffs if we don’t have a deal in 50 days,” Trump said, adding, “I use trade for a lot of things. But it’s great for settling wars.”The MAGA chief also said, “We’re going to be doing secondary tariffs. If we don’t have a deal in 50 days, it’s very simple. And they’ll be at 100 percent, and that’s the way it is.”Trump’s recent announcement signals a possible change in the administration’s approach to the conflict, which has lasted over three years. His special envoy to Ukraine and Russia met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv on Monday, as part of ongoing diplomatic efforts.Melania Trump had not previously spoken publicly about the war. However, her native country, Slovenia, has distanced itself from Russia since the 2022 invasion. A month into the war, a Russian airstrike destroyed Slovenia’s consulate in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city.Trump’s comments about Melania’s involvement were welcomed by pro-Ukraine voices online, who hailed her as a quiet but influential ally against Russian aggression. The first lady was recently seen attending the FIFA Club World Cup final at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey with the president.","Donald Trump said his wife and first lady, Melania, played a key role in pushing him to take a harder stance against Vladimir Putin over the Russia-Ukraine war.

Bondi overpromised for months about Epstein releases and then the administration announced that Epstein did not have any client list and hence, there would be no more investigation or prosecution in the case.“Dan Bongino is a very good guy. I’ve known him a long time. I’ve done his show many, many times. And he sounded terrific, actually, no, I think he’s in good shape,"" President Donald Trump said on Bongino.","California Democrat Rep.

Mamdani not focused on their backroom deals



'When you get knocked down...'







Dormer Governor Andrew Cuomo who had a crushing defeat in the Democratic primary by Zohran Mamdani decided that he will stay in the election as an independent campaigner, If the polls show that he is not the highest-ranked challenger to Mr. Mamdani by early September, he will pledge to drop out of the race, people aware of the developments said.Cuomo will encourage other challengers, mayor Eric Adams, who is running as an independent, Curtis Silwa, the Republican nominee, Jim Walden, an independent candidate -- to do the same.The race is now in favor of Mamdani as Democrats outnumber Republicans by a 6 to 1 margin in New York City, and the winner of the Democratic primary is usually a heavy favorite to win the general election.Zohran Mamdani's spokesperson Jeffrey Lerner said Mamdani is now focused on making New York City more affordable for New Yorkers, and does not care about Cuomo's renewed interest in the race.“While Andrew Cuomo and Eric Adams are tripping over themselves to cut backroom deals with billionaires and Republicans, Zohran Mamdani is focused on making this city more affordable for New Yorkers,” Lerner said in a statement to the NYT “That’s the choice this November.”“The general election is in November and I am in it to win it,” Cuomo announced in a video. “Thank you for believing in me, in my agenda and in my experience, and I am truly sorry that I let you down,” he says in the video. “But as my grandfather used to say, when you get knocked down, learn the lesson and pick yourself back up and get in the game, and that is what I’m going to do.

Where is Ghislaine Maxwell now? Is she the only one who can disclose Epstein's client list?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/where-is-ghislaine-maxwell-now-is-she-the-only-one-who-can-disclose-epsteins-client-list/articleshow/122459263.cms,"Ghislaine Maxwell is willing to spill the beans on Epstein to put forward her side of the story.

Where is Ghislaine Maxwell now ?



Is Maxwell the only person who can reveal Epstein's client?







Jeffrey Epstein's former aide and girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell apparently wants to testify before Congress and put forward her side of the story as she believes she should not have been convicted in the sex trafficking case as a conduit of the disgraced financier Epstein. As the Donald Trump government closed the Epstein investigation,n blocking the way for any further investigation and action, sources claimed that Maxwell was never approached to testify in Congress, which she would agree to do.The revelation has turned a new leaf in the ongoing controversy over the Epstein case as many social media users feared for her life after this disclosure. Epstein's suicide in his prison cell was mysterious and so was the death of Virginia Giuffre, an accuser of the case, earlier this year. Virginia accused Prince Andrew of sexually abusing her when she was 17 and was trafficked by Epstein and Maxwell.Maxwell remains at Federal Correctional Institution in Tallahassee. She follows the jail's fitness routine as she was seen walking and jogging around the track. Since her sentence began three years ago, she has taken on leadership roles at the prison, teaching yoga and etiquette classes and has moved up to the 'honor dorm' for good behavior, it was reported earlier.In 2022, Maxwell, his co-conspirator, was found guilty of five of six counts, including transporting a minor to participate in illegal sex acts, two conspiracy charges and sex trafficking. She was sentenced to 20 years in prison for luring and grooming teenage girls to be exploited by Epstein.Maxwell is considered one of the few people who could reveal the secrets of Epstein. Like Epstein's brother Mark Epstein, Maxwell also believed that Epstein did not commit suicide and was murdered. She lost her appeals against her conviction so far.Now 63 years old, Maxwell is due for release in July 2037.""Despite the rumors, Ghislaine was never offered any kind of plea deal. She would be more than happy to sit before Congress and tell her story,"" the Daily Mail quoted the source as saying. ""No one from the government has ever asked her to share what she knows. She remains the only person to be jailed in connection to Epstein and she would welcome the chance to tell the American public the truth.""","Ghislaine Maxwell was found guilty of five of six counts, including transporting a minor to participate in illegal sex acts, two conspiracy charges and sex trafficking.

More than 20 states have sued the Donald Trump administration over its decision to freeze over $6 billion in federal education grants, including funds for after-school and summer programs that serve low-income families across the country.The funding freeze has especially hit Republican-led areas. According to an analysis by the left-leaning think tank New America, 91 of the 100 school districts that receive the most money from the affected grant programs are in Republican congressional districts. Half of those districts are in California, West Virginia, Florida, and Georgia.Among the programs at risk is the 21st Century Community Learning Centers initiative, which provides free academic support, enrichment, and child care for 1.4 million children at places like the Boys & Girls Clubs, the YMCA, and public schools.The Trump administration says the freeze is to ensure that the programs receiving funds align with the president’s priorities. The Office of Management and Budget has cited concerns about support for undocumented immigrants and LGBTQ+ inclusion.In the meantime, programs around the country are struggling to stay open. In Rhode Island, the state stepped in with emergency funds to keep summer camps running. But leaders at the Boys & Girls Club of America warn that without federal money soon, some of their 926 clubs could begin shutting down in the next few weeks.The YMCA and Save the Children also report that many of their centers are at risk of closing.“Time is of the essence,” said Christy Gleason of Save the Children Action Network. Her group supports after-school programming in 41 rural schools across Washington state and the South, where schools start as early as August.Even some Republican officials are voicing concern. Georgia schools superintendent Richard Woods, a Republican, said, “I deeply believe in fiscal responsibility, which means evaluating the use of funds and seeking out efficiencies, but also means being responsible — releasing funds already approved by Congress and signed by President Trump,""While some remain hopeful that the administration will eventually release the funds, others worry that delays will leave working families without support and children without safe, enriching environments after school.“It’s not too late to make a decision so the kids who really need this still have it,” Gleason said as quoted by AP.","More than 20 states have sued the Trump administration over its decision to freeze over $6 billion in federal education grants.

Poliovirus found in 20 Pakistani districts amid rising vaccine refusals: New sewage data signals resurgence; 13th polio case confirmed in 2025,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/poliovirus-found-in-20-pakistani-districts-amid-rising-vaccine-refusals-new-sewage-data-signals-resurgence-13th-polio-case-confirmed-in-2025/articleshow/122421011.cms,"



Pakistan's battle against polio has hit a fresh setback, with the deadly virus detected in sewage samples across 20 districts, including the capital, just as the country grapples with rising vaccine refusal rates.According to ARY News, citing the National Reference Laboratory, 28 sewage samples collected between May 8 and June 17 tested positive for Wild Poliovirus Type 1 (WPV1). The presence of the virus was confirmed in major urban centres such as Lahore, Karachi, and Islamabad, as well as in districts across Sindh, Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir.Sindh reported the highest contamination, with 14 positive samples from 10 districts. Lahore recorded three cases, while Islamabad and four districts in KP also registered positive samples. In Balochistan, the virus was found in Mastung, Khuzdar, and Sibi. Mirpur in PoJK also showed signs of the virus.This alarming development follows Pakistan’s second national polio vaccination drive earlier this year, which saw over 60,000 refusals, 39,000 of them in Karachi alone. These refusals, officials say, are now posing a major roadblock to the country’s eradication efforts.“We’re not just fighting a virus; we’re battling misinformation and mistrust,” a senior health official told ARY News.Pakistan remains one of only two countries where polio is still endemic, the other being Afghanistan. With the confirmation of another new case this week, the total number of polio cases in the country has reached 13 so far in 2025.Health experts warn that the virus spreads primarily through contaminated water or food and can cause paralysis or death. There is no cure for polio, making vaccination the only defense. The World Health Organisation emphasises that multiple oral doses are needed to protect children under five, the group most vulnerable to the disease.Despite ongoing national campaigns, large pockets in southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa remain difficult to access for vaccination teams, leaving thousands of children at risk.As the virus resurfaces in urban and rural sewers alike, officials say the next phase in Pakistan’s anti-polio war must tackle both the virus, and vaccine hesitancy, with equal urgency.","Sindh reported the highest contamination, with 14 positive samples from 10 districts.

Pakistan’s economic performance under the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) $7 billion loan programme has been “strong so far”, according to Mahir Binici, the IMF’s Resident Representative for Pakistan, reported PTI.Speaking at a lecture hosted by the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) in Islamabad on Sunday, Binici said Pakistan’s first review under the three-year Extended Fund Facility (EFF), approved in July 2024, was successfully completed by the IMF Executive Board in May.The EFF aims to cement macroeconomic stability and lay the groundwork for “stronger, more inclusive and resilient growth,” he said. So far, Pakistan has received two instalments under the programme, with the government implementing agreed policy measures aimed at fiscal discipline and investor confidence.“Early policy measures have helped restore macroeconomic stability and rebuild investor confidence, despite persistent external challenges,” Binici noted.He stressed the importance of structural reforms to ensure long-term economic sustainability, including strengthening tax equity, improving the business climate, and encouraging private-sector-led investment.Binici also welcomed Pakistan’s commitment to climate-related reforms under the $1.3 billion Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF), approved in March.The RSF supports projects focused on disaster preparedness, efficient water use, green investments, and better climate data transparency.“Support through the RSF will not only strengthen Pakistan’s climate resilience but also help unlock green investments and foster a more climate-conscious economic trajectory,” he said.On regional prospects, Binici said economic growth in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, including Pakistan, was expected to improve in 2025 and beyond. However, he warned that global economic uncertainty remains high due to trade tensions, geopolitical fragmentation, and weakening cooperation.","Pakistan's economic performance under IMF's $7 billion loan programme has been'strong so far' Mahir Binici, the IMF’s Resident Representative for Pakistan, spoke at a lecture in Islamabad.

Karachi blackout protest chokes city traffic: Punjab Colony residents block roads after 24-hour outage; report points to systemic collapse,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/karachi-blackout-protest-chokes-city-traffic-punjab-colony-residents-block-roads-after-24-hour-outage-report-points-to-systemic-collapse/articleshow/122418234.cms,"



A protest over a prolonged power outage in Karachi’s Punjab Colony spiraled into city-wide traffic chaos on Saturday, underscoring what many see as chronic governance failure and energy mismanagement in Pakistan, Dawn reported.Residents of an 80-flat, 10-storey building blocked a major road near Punjab Chowrangi after going more than 24 hours without electricity. Power had reportedly been out since 11 am Friday, and despite repeated complaints, K-Electric, Karachi’s sole power distributor, allegedly failed to respond.The resulting sit-in crippled traffic on Defence Road and nearby areas. Long queues of trucks and tankers vital to Karachi Port were stalled from Qayyumabad to the KPT Flyover. Major intersections like Boat Basin, Gizri, and Hino Chowrangi were brought to a standstill, leaving thousands of commuters stranded, according to Dawn.The outage reportedly followed K-Electric’s anti-theft operation in the adjacent P&T Colony. Protesters claimed legal connections were also cut off in the sweep, with no clear procedure followed. KE, however, described the protestors as ""miscreants"" attempting to restore illegal connections and said their teams were attacked during the operation, allegedly linked to a cable TV network.No evidence was provided implicating all affected residents in theft.While KE later claimed to have restored power to parts of the area, the larger issue remains unresolved. The incident highlights Pakistan’s ongoing struggle to provide reliable electricity, exacerbated by outdated infrastructure and lack of accountability in power distribution.As Dawn noted, the crisis is less about one blackout and more a reflection of systemic dysfunction, where citizens bear the brunt of institutional failure.","Residents of an 80-flat, 10-storey building blocked a major road near Punjab Chowrangi after going more than 24 hours without electricity.

PESHAWAR: An under-construction government primary school for girls in Pakistan's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province was damaged in an IED blast by unknown militants, police said on Friday.No casualties were reported as the building was unoccupied at the time of the explosion.Militants had planted an explosive material inside the premises of the Azaan Javed Primary School in Baka Khel police jurisdiction of Bannu district.The device was detonated with a powerful blast, causing substantial structural damage to the building.An FIR has been registered and forensic teams have been deployed to collect evidence from the blast site, police said.Authorities have condemned the attack as an attempt to derail educational development in the region.According to a report by the Lowy Institute, an Australian think tank, more than 1,100 girls' schools have been destroyed in the tribal areas between 2007 to 2017, with teachers and young students also targeted.Before an all-out military operation launched by Pakistan's security forces in 2014, the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) carried out hundreds of attacks on girls' schools in the tribal areas and settled districts of the northwestern province from its stronghold in Swat district.After the crackdown, TTP militants fled to Afghanistan and began to orchestrate cross border attacks from their new sanctuaries.The Taliban takeover of Kabul has emboldened the TTP, which is fighting to regain control of its strongholds in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.Since the takeover of Afghanistan in 2021, the Taliban has banned girls from attending school beyond the sixth grade and banned women from universities.Pakistani Taliban, who are ideologically closer to Afghan Taliban, are trying to enforce a similar anti-education and theocratic agenda in Pakistan's tribal areas by force.The youngest Nobel Prize laureate, Malala Yousafzai, who is from Swat district, was shot in the face when she was 14 by TTP gunmen in 2012 as she wanted to pursue her education.","Militants planted an explosive material inside the premises of the Azaan Javed Primary School.

Nine people were shot dead by rebels in Pakistan’s Balochistan province late Thursday after they were pulled off passenger buses. The victims were targeted based on their identity cards showing Punjab origins, as per reports.According to Dawn, two buses travelling from Quetta to Punjab were intercepted near Sur-Dakai along the Loralai-Zhob highway. Armed men reportedly blocked the road, boarded the vehicles, and began checking passengers’ CNICs.Those identified as residents of Punjab were taken off at gunpoint and later killed. “The terrorists forced the two passenger buses to stop on a highway and pulled nine passengers out. They took them in an area nearby and killed all of them,” said local official Naveed Alam, speaking to AFP.District administrator Saadat Hussain confirmed that the bodies were later recovered from the roadside. “The forces found the dead bodies all belong to different areas of Punjab,” he told AFP.“The terrorists must have taken the passengers’ identification documents with them,” AC Alam told Dawn.While no group initially claimed responsibility, the Balochistan Liberation Front (BLA) later took credit. The group has waged a long-running insurgency against the Pakistani state, frequently targeting non-Baloch civilians and military personnel.The Baloch insurgency, which seeks independence from Islamabad, has intensified in recent years despite claims by Pakistani authorities that it is under control. President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the killings, blaming “terrorists from the outlawed BLA” for seeking to destabilise the country.The killings echo a similar attack last year in which 23 passengers were killed. Human rights groups and separatists have accused Pakistan’s security forces of brutal counter-insurgency tactics, including enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings.","Nine people were shot dead by rebels in Pakistan’s Balochistan province.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s political temperature spiked on Thursday after Jemima Goldsmith, ex-wife of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan , accused the govt of denying their sons the right to speak with their father and threatening them with arrest if they attempt to visit the country.In a strongly worded post on X, Goldsmith said her sons, Sulaiman and Qasim Khan, have not been allowed to speak to Imran, who has been held in solitary confinement in Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail for nearly two years.“Pakistan’s govt has now said if they go there to try to see him, they too will be arrested and put behind bars,” she wrote. “This isn’t politics. It’s a personal vendetta.”Her intervention has triggered widespread reactions both domestically and abroad, with PTI accusing govt of using intimidation tactics ahead of a major protest planned for Aug 5 to mark two years of Khan’s incarceration.Reports suggest the sons, currently based in the UK, were planning to join the protest movement. However, Goldsmith’s statement appears to signal serious concern about their safety.Adviser to the Prime Minister on political affairs Rana Sanaullah, responding to the claims, said: “Why won’t they be arrested? If they come to lead a violent movement, the consequences will follow.” Law minister Aqeel Malik also warned that entry could be denied if their intent is to “spread discord”.Goldsmith’s post has reignited criticism of Khan’s detention conditions, with human rights groups raising an alarm over his prolonged solitary confinement — reportedly 22 hours a day — and limited access to lawyers and family. Khan’s son Qasim also weighed in, posting: “My father... has now spent over 700 days in prison – held in solitary confinement.”The row comes amid intense political speculation in Islamabad, including unconfirmed reports of President Asif Ali Zardari ’s possible resignation and a rumoured meeting between Khan and longtime rival Nawaz Sharif in jail.Interior minister Mohsin Naqvi has rejected the reports, calling them part of a “malicious foreign campaign” and denying claims that Army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir is being considered for the presidency under a proposed shift to a presidential system, a move Khan has condemned as “monarchic”.Khan, who faces over 150 legal cases, has rejected any negotiations with the Shehbaz Sharif govt.

ISLAMABAD: Alphabet-owned YouTube has told more than two dozen critics of the Pakistani govt that it is considering blocking their channels after a local court sought to ban them for being ""anti-state"".The channels that could be blocked include that of the main opposition party, of its chief, jailed former PM Imran Khan, and journalists critical of govt, according to a June 24 court order. The judicial magistrate court in Islamabad said it was seeking the ban after national cyber crime investigation agency criticised the channels in a report for ""sharing highly provocative and derogatory contents against state institutions and officials of state of Pakistan"".Rights campaigners say any ban would further undermine free speech in Pakistan, where authorities are accused of stifling newspapers and television, and social media is seen as one of the few outlets for dissent.

State minister for interior Talal Chaudhry said the creators would also face criminal charges. ""It's not only about anchors getting fired or YouTube channels getting banned.

Beijing 'Open To Arming' Allies





ISLAMABAD: In a rare show of coordinated praise, senior defence officials from China and Turkiye have commended the combat readiness and operational capability of the Pakistan Air Force following last month’s four-day conflict with India, a development seen in Islamabad as quiet validation of its evolving airpower doctrine.In back-to-back high-level visits to Air Headquarters in Islamabad this week, top officials from the People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) and the Turkish ministry of defence hailed PAF’s “decisive” response and “battle-proven” performance during the May clashes.China’s Chief of Air Staff, Lt Gen Wang Gang, met PAF chief Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu on Tuesday and described Pakistan’s aerial actions as “a textbook example of precision, discipline and courage in the face of unprovoked aggression”. He praised PAF’s integration of multi-domain operations (MDOs), calling it a “hallmark of modern air warfare”, and expressed interest in adopting elements of PAF’s doctrine for the PLAAF.A day later, on Wednesday, Turkiye defence minister Yaşar Güler offered similar praise. Calling the PAF’s performance “exceptional”, Güler lauded Sidhu’s “insightful leadership” and highlighted PAF’s role in the “resolute defence of national sovereignty”.He also proposed expanded cooperation in training, unmanned aerial systems, and disruptive technologies.Güler’s visit coincided with the arrival of Turkiye foreign minister Hakan Fidan on Wednesday, signalling coordinated diplomatic and military outreach as Pakistan seeks to shore up support from key allies.Neither China nor Turkiye elaborated on the details of the May conflict — downplayed by Islamabad and denied outright by New Delhi — but both echoed Pakistan’s military narrative, offering a diplomatic boost as Islamabad contends with regional isolation and growing India-West defence ties.Both delegations were briefed on PAF’s restructured posture, including its focus on AI-driven targeting and cyber-electronic warfare. PLAAF officials reportedly showed strong interest in the JF-17 Block III, a jointly developed fighter jet now equipped with AESA (active electronically scanned array) radar and advanced avionics.The Turkish side proposed joint working groups to fast-track industry-to-industry ties — part of Ankara’s push to expand its defence footprint in South Asia amid rising collaboration with Pakistan on drones, pilot training, and aerospace development.The rare twin endorsements from two of Pakistan’s closest allies reflect a shifting regional balance, with China and Turkiye increasingly positioning themselves as strategic counterweights to India’s deepening ties with the US, France and Israel.While India denies any aerial losses, the external praise for PAF suggests otherwise, raising questions about whether these visits signal deeper strategic alignment or simply calculated shows of support.Islamabad and Ankara on Wednesday agreed to boost their cooperation in a range of sectors, including defence, trade, energy and infrastructure, aiming to enhance bilateral trade volume to $5 billion. This was agreed during talks between Fidan and Guler with Pakistan foreign minister Ishaq Dar here. “Pakistan would like to benefit from Turkiye’s expertise and experiences in this (defence) field,” Dar said. “We are actively engaged in different activities, including capacity building and counterterrorism,” Dar said, describing Turkiye as a ""trusted friend"" and a ""reliable brother”. ""We are pursuing the establishment of a Special Economic Zone dedicated to Turkish entrepreneurs at Karachi,” Dar said. He also mentioned finalising the revival of the Istanbul-Tehran-Islamabad train.",Senior defence officials from China and Turkiye have commended the combat readiness and operational capability of the Pakistan Air Force.

PHNOM PENH: Cambodia's military will begin conscripting civilians next year, Prime Minister Hun Manet said Monday, citing rising tensions with Thailand as the reason for activating a long-dormant mandatory enlistment law.Cambodia's parliament in 2006 approved a law that would require all Cambodians aged 18 to 30 to serve in the military for 18 months, although it has never been enforced.Relations with neighbouring Thailand have been tense since May, when a long-standing territorial dispute boiled over into cross-border clashes, killing one Cambodian soldier.""This episode of confrontation is a lesson for us and is an opportunity for us to review, assess, and set our targets to reform our military,"" Hun Manet said.""From 2026, the military conscription law will be implemented,"" he told a ceremony at the Royal Gendarmerie Training Centre in central Kampong Chhnang province.Hun Manet said the service period would be extended from the 18 months outlined in the legislation passed two decades ago to 24 months, and pledged to ""look at increasing"" Cambodia's defence budget.""Our national defence, the building of our military, is not to invade anybody's territory but it is to protect our territory,"" he added.The Cambodian soldier was killed by Thai troops in a firefight in a disputed area known as the Emerald Triangle, where the borders of both countries and Laos meet.The incident soured relations between Phnom Penh and Bangkok -- causing the closure of border crossings as Cambodia banned fuel and gas imports from Thailand.It also caused a domestic political crisis in Thailand, where Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra has been suspended from office pending an ethics probe over her conduct during the row.A diplomatic call between Paeotongtarn and Hun Manet's father, former leader Hun Sen, was leaked from the Cambodian side, sparking a judicial investigation.Neighbouring Thailand already has military conscription for young and able-bodied men, who enter a lottery to determine whether they have to serve.","Cambodia's parliament in 2006 approved a law that would require all Cambodians aged 18 to 30 to serve in the military for 18 months.

They were disarmed and given medical help and humanitarian aid by Thai military and police.Thai forces have stepped up patrols along the border in western Tak province, warning of a possible “violation of sovereignty by foreign armed forces”.Saw Thamain Tun, a leader of the KNLA’s political wing, confirmed the fighting near the border and said joint forces had “seized some front posts” from the Myanmar army.“Some (Myanmar troops) defected to our joint forces, but some of them ran into Thailand,” he told AFP.Karen armed groups have long opposed the military and now play a major role in resisting junta control in the border regions.The civil war has displaced large numbers of people, with around 81,000 refugees or asylum seekers from Myanmar currently in Thailand, according to the United Nations.The KNLA has been fighting for decades for greater autonomy for the Karen people in southeastern Myanmar.","More than 500 people, including civilians and soldiers, crossed into Thailand on Saturday.

A 4.5 magnitude earthquake struck Myanmar on Friday, said the National center for seismology (NCS). The tremor occurred at a depth of 101 km, with its epicenter at 25.76 N latitude and 95.26 E longitude.There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries.This was the third earthquake to hit the country in July. Earlier, on July 7, a 4.6 magnitude earthquake shook the region at 10.40 am IST. The quake struck at a depth of 85 km.On July 3, another earthquake of magnitude 4.1 hit Myanmar early morning. Shallow earthquakes are generally more dangerous due to the stronger ground shaking they produce, potentially causing more damage and casualties.Myanmar has been facing increased seismic activity in recent months. On March 28, the country was hit by powerful earthquakes measuring 7.7 and 6.4 in central regions. In the aftermath, the world health organisation (WHO) raised concerns about rising health threats among displaced populations, including tuberculosis (TB), HIV, and vector- and water-borne diseases, as reported by ANI.Myanmar is highly vulnerable to moderate and large magnitude earthquakes, as well as tsunami threats along its coastline. The Sagaing Fault, which runs through key regions such as Sagaing, Mandalay, Bago, and Yangon, increases the seismic risk for nearly half of the country’s population.Despite being some distance from the fault, Yangon remains at significant risk due to its dense population. Historical records show that an earthquake in Bago in 1903 with a magnitude of 7.0 also impacted Yangon.","A 4.5 magnitude earthquake struck Myanmar on Friday.

Four members accused of stealing over 1 million pounds worth of jewellery from London’s Indian and South Asian communities were jailed Friday after they pleaded guilty to burglary.Jerry O’Donnell, Barney Maloney, Quey Adger and Patrick Ward, part of an organised crime network, have been sentenced for a total 17 years and one month after the Metropolitan Police led out a “comprehensive operation” against them.Head of investigation Met Police detective sergeant Lee Davison, said the gang “largely targeted the South Asian community throughout the capital,” as quoted by PTI.“This comprehensive operation enabled us to disrupt a key part of an organised crime network.

Jury shown CCTV footage of two brothers assaulting police officers at Manchester Airport





A police officer has told a jury that she was left “absolutely terrified” after she was punched during a brawl with two men at the Manchester Airport last year. PC Lydia Ward from Greater Manchester was left with a broken nose in the incident that took place on July 23 last year at the Terminal 2 car park pay station, as reported by the BBC.She was allegedly attacked by Mohammed Fahir Amaaz, 20, and his brother Muhammad Amaad, 26. Both men are from Rochdale, Greater Manchester, and have denied the allegations.The jury heard that Amaaz was approached at a ticket machine by the female cop and two of her colleagues after they received a complaint that a man who fit his description had head-butted a customer at a Starbucks in the airport.Amaaz apparently resisted, and his brother then intervened. ""I was trying to keep hold of Mr Amaaz's arm and get it behind his back so I could get some cuffs on him,” said Ward. One of her colleagues was then pushed, and Amaaz started to kick him, said Ward.""I tried to grab him off so he could stop kicking PC Marsden. All I remember then is that he turned and he punched me straight in the face,” she said as reported by the BBC. ""I can't really remember where it landed but I know where my injuries were.I remember falling on the floor and everything went black.""""I was terrified to be honest. I was absolutely terrified. I had never experienced that level of violence towards me in my life,” she added. ""I didn't know who was going to come up at me next. I was scared of going after this male again and being punched in the face again.""Ward said people around them did not come up to help, and were “filming on their mobile phones"", ""Nobody came to assist. I felt everyone in that room was against us. To be honest, I was terrified,” she said.Footage from the bodycam that was presented in the court showed Ward was being comforted by one of her colleagues.Rosemary Fernandes, the lawyer representing Amaaz, suggested that her client was “taken by surprise” and was “shocked”. She also stressed that Amaaz had acted out in “lawful self-defence.” ""It is important you identify yourselves as police officers, isn't it?"" she asked.Ward said that they did not have the time for any “rational discussion” as the situation turned “violent quickly"". ""He could see I was a police officer and he could see I was a female as well,” she added.Amaaz was accused of assaulting PC Marsden and PC Ward, resulting in actual bodily harm, and also accused of assaulting PC Cook and Abdulkareem Ismaeil from Starbucks.His brother was accused of having assaulted PC Marsden, resulting in actual bodily harm.

What is the new migration scheme?



More long-range missiles for Ukraine



Macron calls for recognition of Palestinian state







France and the United Kingdom on Thursday reached several deals on migration, nuclear cooperation and support for Ukraine, after a visit from French President Emmanuel Macron to London.The three-day visit was hosted by UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and included a carriage procession to Windsor Castle with King Charles and a state banquet.Starmer and Macron held a press conference on Thursday where they announced the deals, highlighting tougher migration controls.The two countries agreed on a ""one in, one out"" returns scheme, where the UK would be deporting undocumented people arriving in small boats to France, in return for accepting an equal number of legitimate asylum seekers with British family connections.""I'm pleased to announce our agreement today on a ground breaking returns pilot. For the very first time, migrants arriving in small boats will be detained and returned to France in short order,"" Starmer said.""This will show others trying to make the same journey that it will be in vain,"" he added.The agreement would need ""prior legal scrutiny in full transparency and understanding with the Commission and EU member states,"" which may delay its implementation.Starmer had been under pressure to address high levels of immigration in the UK, including asylum seekers arriving by small boats across the Channel from France, as his popularity has sunk and the populist Reform UK party, led by Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage, has grown in prominence.Aside from migration, the two leaders also addressed the key issue of support for Ukraine.Starmer and Macron dialled into a meeting Thursday of the so-called ""coalition of the willing"" on Ukraine, announcing that new headquarters for the European-led, 30-nation bloc had opened in Paris.The two leaders also pledged to order more Storm Shadow cruise missiles, while stepping up work on a replacement system.The long-range, air-launched missiles have been shipped to Ukraine in significant numbers to help Kyiv in its war with Russia.During the visit, the two leaders also touched on Israel's war in Gaza. French President Emmanuel Macron urged joint UK-France recognition of a Palestinian state.Macros said it represented ""the only hope for peace"" in the region.The French president said he wanted to ""initiate this political dynamic"" of recognizing Palestinian statehood.Macron said in London that a ceasefire was a matter of ""absolute urgency.""""We are aware that a political way out is crucial, and I believe in the future of the two-state solution as a basis for regional security architecture which will enable Israel to live in peace and security alongside its neighbours,"" he added.","France and the UK reach several deals on migration, nuclear cooperation and support for Ukraine.

"Epstein case closed by FBI: 'Disgraced' Prince Andrew free to travel abroad, no fear of arrest",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/epstein-case-closed-by-fbi-disgraced-prince-andrew-free-to-travel-abroad-no-fear-of-arrest/articleshow/122373394.cms,"Prince Andrew is now free to travel as US closes Epstein case.

Prince Andrew’s ‘HOUSE ARREST’ OVER? King Charles’ Brother Walks Free As FBI Drops Epstein Probe

Prince Andrew becomes the only name on Epstein's list







As the US government finally closed the Epstein case announcing that the convicted sex offender who died in 2019 by suicide did not have a client list, Prince Andrew who was linked to the case is now free to travel abroad. According to reports, there was no embargo on Prince Andrew but he imposed a travel ban on himself as he was stated that he could be arrested if he travels outside the UK.The 65-year-old Royal family member who lost all his titles after he was accused of sexually exploiting a minor at Epstein island left the UK once in the last six years. “He has been abroad once since the scandal erupted,” a source told the Sun.“He has always been very nervous about going abroad and felt he’d always be looking over his shoulder as he could be subject to civil action or at worst, being arrested.”“Hopefully with this out of the way it means he can at least leave the country,” the insider said. “What’s he supposed to do with the rest of his life? He hasn’t been convicted of any crime and can’t sit around doing nothing at Royal Lodge forever.”Before the lawsuit, he was known to be trotting the globe.Virginia Giuffre, the woman who mysteriously died by suicide earlier this year, sued Prince Andrew and claimed that she was forced to have sexual encounters with Andrew when she was 17, after she was trafficked by Epstein.In 2022, Giuffre and Andrew's attorneys reached an agreement to settle the case in exchange of a hefty amount of money but Prince Andrew denied any wrongdoing. He said he did not even remember meeting Giuffre, though his photo with Giuffre surfaced online.In 2020, the FBI had asked the UK Home Office to assist it in bringing Andrew in for questioning, but the investigation was put on hold in 2024 for reasons unknown. Andrew admitted that he had associations with Epstein but he cut those in 2010. But it was later found out that he wrote to Epstein in 2011: ""Keep in close touch and we'll play some more soon"".","Prince Andrew is now free to travel as US closes Epstein case.

"'Nightmare to work with Indians': Citi in London fires woman for racial comment, she now sues bank",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/nightmare-to-work-with-indians-citi-in-london-fires-woman-for-racial-comment-she-now-sues-bank/articleshow/122369922.cms,"Citi Bank London fired a senior employee after she said it was a nightmare to work with Indians.

'Can't remember because of menopause'







Ann Watson, a former Citigroup employee, who was fired in 2023 for her comment that it was a nightmare to work with Indians, has now sued the bank alleging that she was unfairly discriminated. Watson was giving an internal job interview in which she told an Indian-origin interviewer that her project failed because she was working with a team of Indians. ""No offense to you,"" she said noting that the interviewer was also of Indian-origin.“The project failed because I was working with a team of Indians. No offense to you, Kapil, but you know what Indians are like to work with it’s a nightmare,” she allegedly said.When she made the comment, the interview was stopped and Watson was asked to wait in the online waiting room. When the interview resumed, she said, ""Now it's your chance, Kapil, to get me back.""The HR team later contacted her after a month of the interview and said she was fired for her racial comment.“I was horrified to hear these as I would not blame a culture or country for any kind of failure or direct any such comments toward an interview panel that I was applying for a role with,” she said in her witness statement prepared for the London hearing.Watson said she did not deny making the comment but she could not recall it because of the symptoms of long Covid-19 and menopause. She said she was remorseful though she has no recollection of what she said.Citi said its investigation into Watson was fair and impartial, and stood by the decision to fire her. Watson said the firing was too harsh and it did not take into account her 12 years of service at the bank and came at a time when she was going through a tough menopause. The bank said her menopause condition could not have made or contributed to the racist comments that she made.","Ann Watson, a former Citigroup employee, who was fired in 2023 for her comment that it was a nightmare to work with Indians, has now sued the bank.

"Royal ‘plan’: Prince William was wary of Meghan Markle’s entry into family, biographer makes startling revelation",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/royal-plan-prince-william-was-wary-of-meghan-markles-entry-into-family-biographer-makes-startling-revelation/articleshow/122369559.cms,"Prince William (AP) and Meghan Markle (ANI)

Royal Exit Sealed? Meghan Pulls The Plug As Archie’s Title Sparks Fresh Palace Turmoil





Prince William was reportedly wary of Meghan Markle’s alleged “plan” of getting married into the royal family through Prince Harry, claimed long-time royal commentator and biographer Phil Dampier.The Prince of Wales, 43, apparently had early doubts about Meghan’s intentions of joining the royal family, Damper told The Sun.His skepticism is said to have surfaced around the same time Queen Elizabeth II’s cousin, Lady Elizabeth Anson, revealed that the late monarch herself had reservations about Markle’s entry into the royal fold, remarked Dampier.“I think, unfortunately, that confirms what I’ve been saying or thought for the last few years that, sadly, Meghan never really had any intention of staying in the royal family,” he said while referencing to Anson’s comments. “She saw as a stepping stone getting married to Harry to new fame and fortune. And I think that’s what initially Prince William was concerned about,” he added.“That’s why they fell out. And now we are where we are. But to have this confirmed by somebody so close to the Queen is really dynamite,” said Dampier.Lady Elizabeth Anson, who passed in 2020, at the age of 79, told The Times of London, “When I spoke with the queen, she said she is not at all content.Meghan could turn into nothing but trouble. She sees things in a different way.""Dampier said that the revelation was “very, very telling,” noting that it came “right from the horse’s mouth.” He emphasized that the comments made by Anson were credible.Royal broadcaster Esther Krauke weighed in on the revelation and said that the Late Queen’s outlook towards Meghan might have been positive initially, but had changed over time. “The Queen’s opinion of Meghan evolved, and it’s much like how the country’s opinion evolved,” she said to The Sun.“And much like the public, I think the Queen thought Meghan was a breath of fresh air. Very intelligent, very well-spoken, obviously from her acting background,” she said. “And she worked, she welcomed her,” Krakue said. “I think, like much of the country with open arms, I think where things went wrong was clearly the cultural clash.”Krauke also mentioned King Charles is fully aware of how Prince Harry is “totally whipped” by his wife. “We know that King Charles said something about him being whipped,” she commented. “We keep hearing things consistently coming out from courtiers and people that are close to the royal family.”During a state banquet on Tuesday, at Windsor Castle, King Charles. 76 had delivered a speech that had warmly referred to Prince William and Catherine’s family, but made no mention of Prince Harry and Meghan, who exited royal life back in 2020, as reported by The New York Post. French president Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte Macron, were also present at the dinner.","Prince William was reportedly wary of Meghan Markle’s alleged “plan” of getting married into the royal family through Prince Harry, claimed long-time royal commentator and biographer Phil Dampier.

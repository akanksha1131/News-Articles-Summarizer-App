However, as of 2025, only around 36,000 are still alive, according to official figures.For years, some families were allowed to meet at the Mount Kumgang resort in planned reunions, but these meetings often depended on political relations between the two Koreas. The last reunion was in 2018.The reunions were a rare chance for aging family members to meet their loved ones after decades apart, but North Korea has frequently used them as a bargaining tool in negotiations with Seoul.Seoul has condemned Pyongyang's decision, viewing it as yet another setback in inter-Korean relations .","North Korea is tearing down a key venue that once hosted reunions for families separated by the Korean War.

WASHINGTON: Marc Fogel , an American history teacher who was deemed wrongfully detained by Russia, has been released and returned to the US in what the White House described as a diplomatic thaw that could advance negotiations to end the war in Ukraine. The Kremlin said on Wednesday that a Russian citizen was freed in the US in exchange for Moscow's release of American Marc Fogel. Steve Witkoff, a special envoy for President Trump, left Russia with Fogel and brought him to the White House late Tuesday. ""I feel like the luckiest man on Earth right now,"" Fogel said as he stood next to Trump. Trump said another American would be released on Wednesday. The US will release Russian Alexander Vinnik, a suspected cybercrime kingpin, as part of an exchange with Russia, the NYT reported on Wednesday.

Worcester Transgender Sanctuary: 'We are a haven': Worcester declares itself sanctuary for transgender people in defiance of Trump’s gender policies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/we-are-a-haven-worcester-declares-itself-sanctuary-for-transgender-people-in-defiance-of-trumps-gender-policies/articleshow/118196708.cms,"Response to Trump’s policies

'Defending existence'

Worcester, Massachusetts has become one of the first cities in the United States to declare itself a sanctuary for transgender people since Donald Trump won the presidential race and returned to office, New York Post reports.In a 9-2 vote on Tuesday night, with over 200 people present, the Massachusetts city council passed a resolution declaring the state’s second-largest city a haven for trans and gender-diverse people.The resolution is not legally binding but ensures the city won’t use its resources to detain anyone for seeking or providing gender-affirming care . It also bars local authorities from helping out-of-state groups trying to interfere with such healthcare.The city had previously allocated $500,000 towards resources for its LGBTQ community.The move comes in direct response to Trump’s sweeping federal policies on gender, including an executive order that restricts the use of federal funds for child sex-change treatments and another banning biological males from competing in women’s sports.Trump's Republican and conservative base has always condemned the ""radical left"" on gender policies. During his inauguration speech, he declared that the federal government would recognise only two genders—male and female—and vowed to “defeat the toxic poison of gender ideology.”“The trans, nonbinary, and LGBTQIA+ community in Worcester and nationally are being attacked by President Trump,” the resolution said.Before Trump's re-election, cities like San Francisco, Sacramento, Pittsburgh, and Ithaca had already declared themselves trans sanctuaries. Worcester, home to over 207,000 people, is believed to be the first to do so in response to his new policies.The vote followed weeks of public discussion, culminating in a city council session featuring poetry readings and drag performances. Many residents spoke about the need for the resolution.“It’s absolutely exhausting to continue to have to defend your existence. Say the words, say the words that we’d be safe here,” said one speaker, as reported by Boston 25 News.“When the president of the United States, in his inauguration speech, says that you do not exist, it should matter at our local level,” said Joshua Croke, co-founder of a Worcester LGBTQ non-profit for children.While the resolution carries no legal force, its passage signals Worcester’s strong stance against federal policies that activists say endanger the rights and safety of transgender and gender-diverse people.Councilor-At-Large Khrystian King backed his colleague and the petition, stating to NBC Boston News, ""We are a haven. We do not tolerate discrimination, bullying, harassment, violence, threats.""","Worcester, Massachusetts has become one of the first cities in the United States to declare itself a sanctuary for transgender people.

Human rights abuses inflicted on Bangladesh Hindus: UN,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/human-rights-abuses-inflicted-on-bangladesh-hindus-un/articleshow/118196638.cms,"Sheikh Hasina (File photo)

UN reports rights abuses in B'desh 2024 protest response, estimates 1,400 killed

DHAKA: A UN report released on Wednesday found that human rights abuses were inflicted on members of Bangladesh's Hindu, Ahmadiyya Muslim and indigenous communities during the anti-discrimination protests that led to Sheikh Hasina govt's fall and its aftermath in 204.While 100 arrests related to attacks on distinct religious & indigenous groups have reportedly been made, perpetrators of many other acts of revenge violence and targeted attacks on such groups still enjoy impunity, UN Human Rights Office said. After fall of the govt, ""widespread attacks were reported against Hindu homes, businesses and places of worship"", it said. The report validates India's repeated claims of targeted attacks on Hindus & temples.Widespread attacks were reported against Hindu homes, businesses, and places of worship, especially in rural and historically tense areas such as Thakurgaon, Lalmonirhat and Dinajpur, as well as other places such as Sylhet, Khulna, and Rangpur"", said the UN report titled 'Human Rights Violations and Abuses related to Protests of July and August 2024 in Bangladesh'.These destructions were especially prevalent in areas perceived to be sympathetic to the Awami League as Hindus have often been stereotypically associated with this political faction, it added. The report, based on the deaths reported by various credible sources, also estimated that as many as 1,400 people may have been killed during July 1-Aug 15 last year and thousands were injured, the vast majority of whom were shot by Bangladesh's security forces.""Bangladesh's former govt, security and intelligence services, alongside violent elements associated with Awami League, systematically engaged in a range of serious human rights violations during last year's student-led protests,"" it added.Former PM Sheikh Hasina left the country on Aug 5 and Muhammad Yunus-led interim govt began its journey three days later. The report released by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights documented ""troubling instances"" of retaliatory killings and revenge violence during the student-led protests. It stated that security and intelligence services ""systematically engaged"" in rights violations that could amount to crimes against humanity.UN Human Rights chief Volker Turk described the response as a ""calculated and well-coordinated strategy"" by the Hasina govt to retain power amid mass opposition. ""Hundreds of extrajudicial killings, arbitrary arrests, detentions, and torture"" were carried out with political leadership's knowledge and coordination, he added.Director of Rights and Risks Analysis Group (RRAG) Suhas Chakma criticised the report for not identifying individual officers responsible for the carnage, citing the limitations of Yunus's interim govt, which restricted the investigation period from July 5 to Aug 15, 2024.The report also includes recommendations to reform Bangladesh's security and justice sectors. ""The interim govt must ensure that violent crimes targeting supporters of Awami League, police officers, or members of distinct religious and indigenous groups are promptly and independently investigated with due diligence and that identified perpetrators are brought to justice,"" it said.","UN reports rights abuses in B'desh 2024 protest response, estimates 1,400 killed. 100 arrests related to attacks on distinct religious & indigenous groups have reportedly been made. perpetrators of many other acts of revenge violence and targeted attacks on such groups still enjoy impunity.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118196706,imgsize-566875,width-400,resizemode-4/118196706.jpg"

Russia-Ukraine war: Here's how much Kyiv is paying young recruits to join military service,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/russia-ukraine-war-heres-how-much-kyiv-is-paying-young-recruits-to-join-military-service/articleshow/118182778.cms,"Ukraine has announced a financial incentive aimed at encouraging young men to enlist in its military, as the war with Russia continues. The Ukrainian defence ministry is offering men between the ages of 18 and 24 a signing bonus of 1 million hryvnias (around Rs 20 lakhs) along with a monthly salary of 120,000 hryvnias (Rs 2.9 lakhs), in a bid to bolster its forces amid growing battlefield challenges, news agency AP reported.Currently, Ukraine's military draft applies to men aged 25 to 60, after the conscription age was lowered from 27 last year. However, this move has not been sufficient to replenish the ranks, with many draft-age men either moving abroad or avoiding service. Desertions have also been an issue, weakening Ukraine’s ability to counter Russian advances, particularly in the east, where its forces are under pressure.The new recruitment offer also includes additional benefits such as a 0% mortgage rate, scholarships for higher education, enhanced healthcare including dental care, and permission to leave the country after one year of service. Recruits will also receive a draft waiver for 12 months following the completion of their contract.The initiative comes at a time when Ukraine is struggling to maintain troop numbers, and concerns have grown over whether military aid from the United States will continue if Donald Trump returns to office. The Biden administration had previously urged Ukraine to lower its draft age to 18, but Kyiv has opted for voluntary enlistment with financial incentives instead.However, the offer risks stirring discontent among existing military personnel. Soldiers performing rear-guard duties such as planning, logistics, and air defence earn approximately 30,000 hryvnias (Rs 72,000) per month, far less than the 120,000 hryvnias promised to new recruits. Currently, only soldiers in direct combat zones receive salaries at that level, and it remains unclear whether new recruits will be paid the same if stationed elsewhere.Meanwhile, tensions remain high at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, where Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of obstructing the rotation of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) staff. Russian forces seized control of the plant early in the invasion, and both sides have repeatedly accused one another of endangering nuclear safety. Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry claimed Russia deliberately disrupted the rotation of IAEA experts, while Moscow accused Ukrainian forces of blocking access and launching drone attacks on the convoy transporting the personnel.Separately, Ukraine announced the arrest of a high-ranking security official accused of working for Russia. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) stated that Vasyl Maliuk, head of the agency, personally led the operation, codenamed ""Rat."" The detained official, reportedly a chief-of-staff within the SBU’s Anti-Terrorist Centre, is accused of passing sensitive information to Russia. The SBU claims to have documented 14 instances of espionage and has charged the suspect with high treason, which carries a potential life sentence.","Ukrainian defence ministry offers men between 18 and 24 a signing bonus of 1 million hryvnias (around Rs 20 lakhs) Recruits will also receive a monthly salary of 120,000 hryVnias.

Harry Bolz Meaning: Elon Musk changes his X (formerly Twitter) profile name to Harry Bolz: What does it mean?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/elon-musk-changes-ex-name-to-harry-bolz-what-does-it-mean/articleshow/118146142.cms,"What Does Harry Bōlz Mean?

April 2023: The ‘Harry Bōlz’ Incident

December 2024: ‘Kekius Maximus’ and Internet Subcultures

Why Does Musk Change His Name?

Humour and Entertainment – Many of Musk’s social media antics, including his name changes, seem intended to amuse both himself and his audience.

Cultural References – He frequently taps into online trends and memes, demonstrating his awareness of internet subcultures.

Disruptive Marketing – By generating discussions around his name changes, Musk keeps attention on his X profile and maintains engagement with his audience.

Elon Musk changed his X account name to Harry Bōlz on Tuesday, marking the second time he has adopted this alias. The billionaire had briefly used the same handle in April 2023. His latest stunt comes just hours after reports emerged that a Musk-led consortium of investors has placed a bid to take control of OpenAI.The 53-year-old, who heads the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), is currently making cuts across multiple federal agencies in an effort to reduce government spending.Musk likely used the name as a play on words, referencing the slang term ‘hairy balls’. While the reason behind his latest name change remains unclear, Musk previously explained the joke in a tweet back in 2023.Musk, the billionaire entrepreneur and owner of X (formerly Twitter), is well known for his unpredictable and often humorous online behaviour. Among his many quirks is a habit of changing his display name on the platform, sometimes as a joke and other times as a cryptic nod to internet culture. While Musk has altered his name multiple times, two notable instances stand out—his brief use of “Harry Bōlz” in April 2023 and “Kekius Maximus” in December 2024.In April 2023, Musk changed his display name on X to ""Harry Bōlz."" At the time, the reasoning behind this move was not immediately clear. However, it was widely interpreted as a joke, playing on the phonetic similarity to “hairy balls,” a slang term often used in internet humour.Musk is no stranger to wordplay and internet memes, frequently engaging in online jokes and trolling. His use of ""Harry Bōlz"" fit well within his typical approach to social media, where he enjoys posting lighthearted, and sometimes controversial, content. This name change also followed a period of heightened attention on Musk’s management of X, as he had taken over the platform in late 2022 and made several sweeping changes, including layoffs and policy updates.While Musk did not provide a detailed explanation for the name change at the time, he later addressed it in a tweet, confirming that it was indeed a joke. The name was short-lived, as Musk quickly reverted to his usual display name.On December 31, 2024, Musk once again changed his display name, this time to ""Kekius Maximus."" Alongside the name change, he updated his profile picture to an image of Pepe the Frog dressed as a Roman gladiator.The term ""Kekius Maximus"" is a reference to ""kek,"" a term popularised in online gaming and internet meme culture. Originating from World of Warcraft, ""kek"" became associated with internet communities, particularly those engaged in political memes and satire. The name ""Maximus"" is a reference to ancient Roman culture, evoking the title of a powerful general or emperor.By adopting ""Kekius Maximus,"" Musk was making a playful nod to these internet subcultures. The move sparked discussion among his followers, as some saw it as a lighthearted joke, while others speculated that Musk was aligning himself with certain meme-driven online movements. His use of Pepe the Frog, a character that has been widely used in memes across different communities, added another layer of interpretation to his display name change.Musk's tendency to change his display name on X aligns with his broader online persona. He has often embraced internet culture, meme humour, and trolling, using X as a platform to engage with his followers in an informal and often unpredictable manner. His name changes appear to serve multiple purposes:",Elon Musk changed his X account name to Harry Bōlz on Tuesday. The billionaire had briefly used the same handle in April 2023.

NASA made the decision to return the Starliner to Earth for further inspection and troubleshooting, leaving Williams and Wilmore aboard the ISS.Then SpaceX delayed the launch of their replacements on a brand new capsule that needed more prepping, which added more time to Wilmore and Williams' mission.With even more work still anticipated for the new capsule, NASA opted for its next crew to fly up on an older capsule, with liftoff now targeted for March 12. This older capsule had already been assigned to a private crew awaiting launch this spring.Meanwhile, Williams mentioned that she still wanted to get back home but has stressed that a lot of work needs to be done while staying in space. Though she has been away for a record long time, she has remained engaged in her mission by doing essential tasks on board the ISS and advancing NASA's goals in space.

All 47 Democrats voted against Gabbard.McConnell said he did not vote for Gabbard as he was concerned that Gabbard refused to label Edward Snowden as a traitor. “Edward Snowden’s treasonous betrayal of the United States and its most sensitive lawful intelligence activities endangered sources, methods and lives,” McConnell said in a statement after the vote.

Blair House: PM Modi's stay in US



NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi landed in Washington, DC, on Wednesday (local time) for a two-day visit at the invitation of White House to meet US President Donald Trump and other dignitaries. This marks his first visit to the US since President Trump assumed office for a second term. The visit aims to strengthen bilateral relations, particularly in trade, defence, and technology cooperation.PM Modi said in a post on X said, ""Landed in Washington DC a short while ago. Looking forward to meeting @POTUS Donald Trump and building upon the India-USA Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership. Our nations will keep working closely for the benefit of our people and for a better future for our planet.""Upon landing at Joint Base Andrews, he was welcomed by India’s Ambassador to the US, Vinay Mohan Kwatra, along with other senior officials. During his stay, PM Modi will be hosted at Blair House, the historic guest residence for dignitaries visiting the White House.Despite harsh winter conditions, members of the Indian diaspora gathered outside Blair House to welcome PM Modi. People chanted “Bharat Mata Ki Jai”, “Vande Mataram”, and “Modi Modi” as they cheered for the Prime Minister.PM Modi expressed his gratitude in a post on X: “A warm reception in the winter chill.

We are so excited that the US gave the highest priority to our Prime Minister. He is coming here for all 1.4 billion population.”One of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s first engagements in the US was a meeting with Tulsi Gabbard, who was recently confirmed as the Director of National Intelligence under President Trump’s administration.Gabbard’s nomination was approved by the Senate in a 52-48 vote, with most Republicans backing her despite initial reservations over her past remarks on Russia, her meeting with former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and her previous support for whistleblower Edward Snowden. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky was the only Republican to vote against her confirmation.During their meeting, PM Modi recalled his earlier interactions with Gabbard and congratulated her on her new role. Their discussions focused on strengthening bilateral intelligence cooperation, particularly in counter-terrorism, cybersecurity, emerging threats, and strategic intelligence sharing. They also exchanged views on regional and global developments, reaffirming their commitment to a secure, stable, and rules-based international order.PM Modi shared details of their conversation on X, posting, ""Met USA’s Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard in Washington DC.

Bhangarh Fort, India



Forbidden City of Beijing, China



Catacombs of Paris, France



Fairmont Banff Springs, Canada



The Ghostly Island of Tragedy Poveglia Island, Venice



Travellers are fascinated by haunted locations, and most of the world's most iconic destinations offer more than just history and architecture-they also offer a glimpse into the supernatural. Whether it is the Bhangarh Fort with its tragic tale, or some spectral encounters that await at the Forbidden City, or chilling tunnels of bone at the Paris Catacombs; each site promises a unique potpourri of history, mystery, and touch of the unknown. There are haunted places for those interested in the unknown, and through them, a nostalgia fills the air: mixing the thrill of the unknown with the allure of some chapters of history. Explore some of the most renowned haunted sites which adventurers around the world are always keen on visiting.The Bhangarh Fort lies 100 miles from Delhi in the dry state of Rajasthan. This place is among the spookiest sites in India. The crumbling ruins and eerie silence have been a source of mystery, which attracts those interested in the paranormal. It is said that a princess refused to love a sorcerer who was then cursing the fort, and so, it falls, and remains deserted till today. So many who dare venture into it narrate weird feelings and unexplained incidence thereafter. You can spend an absolute serene time in the mysterious beauty of this fort by sitting amidst its haunted beauty and performing some yoga right before dusk.Even the historical and magnificent monument known as the Forbidden City of Beijing, China is still haunted with all sorts of spooky legends and tales. This sprawling palace complex was the seat of Chinese emperors and witnessed numerous palace intrigues, murders, and executions through the long history. Since it opened its gates to the general public in the 1940s, people have frequently reported strange encounters, including the sighting of a ghostly woman in white wandering the historic grounds, often heard weeping. Nothing is more interesting or scarier than the grand Forbidden City, whose dark past lies beneath it.Built in the late 18th century to contend with Paris's overcrowded cemeteries, the Catacombs of Paris are a famous and spooky underground tunnel network. A devastating rainstorm in 1780 overwhelmed the Les Innocents cemetery, and millions of bodies were transferred to abandoned limestone quarries. The catacombs were designed to be able to carry remains of about six million people, creating a macabre labyrinth of bones beneath the city. To this day, tourists can tour through guided tours at such hauntingly spooky tunnels where skulls and bones wallow across the walls in recognition of the dark past of the city.The Fairmont Banff Springs Hotel is deep within the heart of Banff National Park in Canada, associated with ghostly legends. It was opened in 1888 as a magnificent chateau-style hotel, built to attract tourists and increase the sale of train tickets. Though it boasts the most beautiful architecture and breathtaking views, it is also a place of ghostly stories. One of the most popular stories is that of a bride who fell to her death on her wedding day. Other accounts claim that Sam, a bellman, still serves guests before he disappears into thin air. Its beauty makes it interestingly eerie with strange stories of spirits, thus turning this hotel to be the ""must see"" for any one interested in seeing ghosts.Poveglia Island, off the coast of Venice, Italy, has a history steeped in horror and macabre tragedy. Once a quarantine station during the bubonic plague, the island later housed a mental asylum infamous for its horrific experiments on patients. The tragic events that occurred on the island, including the death of a doctor who allegedly threw himself from the asylum's bell tower, have contributed to its haunted reputation. Though visiting the island is forbidden, it is still in sight from Lido's beaches, and most accounts state that hauntingly shrill chimes can be heard from the bell tower even though it was removed decades ago. Poveglia Island, with its haunted past and barren scenery, is a mystery and terror place.","The Bhangarh Fort in Rajasthan, India is one of the spookiest sites in India.

The ministry said its embassy in Tripoli had “dispatched a team” to a local hospital at the site near Marsa Dela port for the identification.Late Tuesday, the ministry disclosed that of the 63 Pakistanis on the boat, the bodies of 16 had been fished out and 37 rescued, while 10 were still missing. “Three of the survivors are in Tripoli, being looked after by the (Pakistani) embassy,” the ministry said in a statement.The tragedy unfolded less than a month after 50 Pakistanis died when a boat with 86 migrants to Europe capsized off Morocco on January 16. Before that, at least 300 Pakistanis had drowned in a migrant boat that sank off Greece in June 2023, with Italy their intended destination.In a travel alert, Pakistan’s Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) has identified Libya as one of 15 transit countries used for human trafficking.Each year, thousands of Pakistanis pay traffickers large sums for risky and illegal journeys to Europe, hoping to find work and send money back to their families. Many also take these perilous routes to escape conflicts and religious persecution.Pakistani authorities claim human smugglers send migrants seeking illegal entry into Europe to Libya, located around 300km from Italy. From there, they either take them by boat to Europe or relocate them to the coastal cities of Morocco and Mauritania in west Africa.On Monday, UN’s International Organisation for Migration (IOM) said it was “deeply alarmed” by the dozens of migrants’ bodies found in mass graves in southeastern Libya. Two days back, Libyan authorities claimed they had found the bodies of 28 sub-Saharan migrants in the southeastern district of Kufra, near a site where they were allegedly detained and tortured.The UN agency expressed shock at the discovery of two mass graves in Libya with bodies of dozens of migrants, some with gunshot wounds.

Pakistan says at least 16 nationals died in migrant boat sinking near Libya,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-says-at-least-16-nationals-died-in-migrant-boat-sinking-near-libya/articleshow/118152842.cms,"Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif expressed grief after a boat carrying Europe-bound migrants sank off Libya’s coast

ISLAMABAD: At least 16 Pakistanis died and 10 others are unaccounted for after a boat carrying dozens of Europe-bound migrants sank at the weekend off the coast of Libya , officials said Tuesday.The ministry of foreign affairs said that 33 of the 37 survivors were in Libyan police custody and one was being treated at a hospital. An estimated 65 people were on the boat, it said.Prime minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed his deep grief and sorrow for those lost in the capsizing in Marsa Dela port in the western city of Zawiya.Sharif ordered the foreign ministry to complete the process of identifying the victims and provide assistance to those affected. He also ordered action against those involved ""in heinous acts like human trafficking,"" according to a statement.Most of the victims came from Kurram, a district in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province bordering Afghanistan , where hundreds of people have been killed in recent years in sectarian clashes.""People try to travel to Europe through illegal means because of unemployment"" at home, said Javed Hussain, a nephew of Shehzad Hussain, one of the victims. He said mourners were gathering at the homes of those who perished in the latest tragedy.In January, authorities said dozens of Pakistanis died when a boat capsized off West Africa. Some of the survivors later accused smugglers of killing 43 migrants in a dispute over payment. Pakistan has since confirmed the deaths of 13 of its nationals.Hundreds of Pakistanis die every year while trying to reach Europe by land and sea with the help of human smugglers. They also use dangerous land and sea routes to reach Europe in an effort to find jobs.Libya, which has borders with six nations and a long shore on the Mediterranean, was plunged into chaos following a Nato-backed uprising that toppled and killed longtime leader Moammar Gadhafi in 2011. Since then, the oil-rich country has emerged as the dominant transit point for migrants fleeing war and poverty in Africa and the Middle East for Europe.At least 674 migrants were reported dead and more than 1,000 missing off Libya in 2024, according to the International Organization for Migration's missing migrants project. More than 21,700 migrants were intercepted and returned to the chaos-stricken country.In 2023, the IOM reported 962 migrants dead and 1,563 missing off Libya. Around 17,200 migrants were intercepted and returned to Libya that year, it said.Those who are returned are held in government-run detention centers rife with abuses, including forced labor, beatings, rapes and torture - practices that amount to crimes against humanity, according to UN-commissioned investigators. The abuse often accompanies attempts to extort money from the families of the imprisoned migrants before releasing them or allowing them to leave Libya on traffickers' boats to Europe.","At least 16 Pakistanis died and 10 others are unaccounted for after a boat carrying dozens of Europe-bound migrants sank off Libya.

Corruption Perceptions Index: Pakistan's ranking on corruption index drops by 2 spots: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistans-ranking-on-corruption-index-drops-by-2-spots-report/articleshow/118143601.cms,"Pakistan's flag

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's ranking on the corruption perception index (CPI) has dropped by 2 spots from 133 in 2023 to 135 in 2024 out of 180 countries, a media report said on Tuesday. The CPI ranks 180 countries and territories by their perceived levels of public sector corruption on a scale of zero (highly corrupt) to 100 (very clean), Dawn.com reported.The CPI report is released annually by Transparency International Berlin.Transparency International Pakistan (TIP) has no role either in the collection of data or the calculation of the country's score, TIP explains.The score for Pakistan also reduced by two points from 29 in CPI 2023 to 27 in CPI 2024.According to a Transparency International document listing Pakistan's CPI ranking and scores from 1996 to 2024, which was seen by Dawn.com, the country's score in the past 10 years has ranged between 27 and 33 points (a higher score indicating less corruption).Since 2012, when the index changed to a scoring scale of 100 from 10, Pakistan's score rose from 27 to 33 in 2018 but declined consecutively back to 27 last year.Statistics from the past show that in 1996, Pakistan ranked only second-last out of 54 countries part of the index back then, with a score of 1/10.From 1997 to 2011, the country's score went back and forth, reaching as high as 2.7 in 1998 and dropping as low as 2.1 in 2004 and 2005.According to TIP chair Justice (retired) Zia Perwez, the scores of all countries in the region except Oman, China, Turkiye and Mongolia declined. The downslide for the region showed that Pakistan was one of the countries holding up against the overall trend in the region.Global corruption levels remained alarmingly high, with efforts to reduce them faltering, according to the CPI report, which exposed serious corruption levels across the globe, with more than two-thirds of countries scoring below 50 out of 100.Almost 6.8 billion people live in countries with CPI scores under 50 - equivalent to 85 per cent of the world population of 8 billion.For the seventh year in a row, Denmark obtained the highest score on the index (90) and was closely followed by Finland (88) and Singapore (84).Countries with the lowest scores were mostly fragile and conflict-affected ones like South Sudan (8), Somalia (9), Venezuela (10), Syria (12), Libya (13), Eritrea (13), Yemen (13) and Equatorial Guinea (13).While the CPI noted that the Middle East and North Africa's rising average score was a ""reason for optimism"", it pointed out that it was the first increase in over a decade and only by one point - to 39 out of 100.According to Transparency International, the top-scoring region was Western Europe and the European Union, but its score ""decreased overall for the second year in a row - many leaders are serving business interests rather than the common good and laws are often poorly enforced"".""While Asia Pacific does have a range of improving countries, its average score is decreasing, as vicious cycles of corruption and climate change impacts take their toll,"" it added.Over a quarter of the countries in the sample (47) got their lowest score yet on the index, including Austria (67), Bangladesh (23), Brazil (34), Cuba (41), France (67), Germany (75), Haiti (16), Hungary (41), Iran (23), Mexico (26), Russia (22), South Sudan (8), Switzerland (81), the United States (65) and Venezuela (10).Over the past five years, seven countries have significantly improved their scores in the index: These include Cote d'Ivoire (45), the Dominican Republic (36), Kosovo (44), Kuwait (46), the Maldives (38), Moldova (43) and Zambia (39).The global average on the index remained unchanged at 43, highlighting the need for urgent action against corruption and warning of a critical global obstacle to implementing successful climate action.",Pakistan's ranking on the corruption perception index (CPI) has dropped by 2 spots from 133 in 2023 to 135 in 2024.

Pakistani lawyers stage protest against high-level meeting of constitutional body to pick eight SC judges,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistani-lawyers-stage-protest-against-high-level-meeting-of-constitutional-body-to-pick-eight-sc-judges/articleshow/118118105.cms,"Representative image (Image credits: ANI)

ISLAMABAD: Hundreds of lawyers on Monday staged protests in Pakistan's national capital against a high-level meeting of a constitutional body with the agenda to appoint at least eight judges of the supreme court. The judicial commission of Pakistan (JCP) meeting was being held despite opposition by four apex court judges, the legal fraternity, resistance by opposition the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf and controversy over the recent transfer of judges to the Islamabad high court (IHC), which was opposed by five IHC judges.The JCP, a top body empowered to approve judicial appointments, will finalise appointments for eight vacant supreme court judges.Lawyers gathered at various locations in Islamabad, with the lawyers' action committee staging a protest near D-Chowk. But police responded by closing several key entry points to the Red Zone, which houses key buildings, including the supreme court.Dozens of protestors gathered at Serena Chowk as they were stopped from going to the supreme court due to the closure of the Red Zone. They chanted ""Azaadi"" (freedom) and ""Lawyers' unity zindabad"" (long live lawyers' unity). They were also holding a banner written in Urdu and reading "" 26th constitutional amendment unacceptable"".Clashes were also reported between lawyers and police when they tried to enter the Red Zone. However, there was no report of any arrest or injury during the protest.The protest led to the suspension of metro bus services on multiple routes between Islamabad and Rawalpindi, causing significant inconvenience for commuters. The closure of the Red Zone has caused traffic disruptions, leading to heavy congestion on different roads in the capital.Earlier, the legal fraternity in the country was already expressing concerns against the new appointments and transfers following the controversial 26th constitutional amendment passed last year.The lawyers' representatives had held a convention at the Islamabad district courts, opposing the 26th amendment and demanding the cancellation of the JCP meeting.They also announced on February 3 to protest against the transfer of three high court judges to the IHC but it could not elicit a widespread response. The Karachi bar association had supported the strike call by staying away.Last month, the Lahore high court bar association (LHCBA) moved an application before the apex court through advocate Muhammad Waqar Rana, seeking postponement of the JCP meeting.The JCP earlier this month asked all high courts to send a list of five senior judges from each for consideration for the appointment of eight of them to the supreme court.Initially, the IHC had forwarded the names of three judges - chief justice Aamer Farooq, justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani and justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb - to the JCP because justices Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri and Babar Sattar did not meet the minimum requirement of five years of service.However, as justice Sarfraz Dogar was made the IHC senior puisne judge following his transfer there from the Lahore high court, his name has also been sent to the JCP.Days before justice Dogar's name was added, five judges of the IHC approached chief justice Yahya Afridi and IHC chief justice Aamer Farooq to reclaim their seniority.Separately, four SC judges, senior puisne judge justice Mansoor Ali Shah, justice Munib Akhtar, justice Ayesha Malik and justice Athar Minallah, in a letter to the chief justice showed concerns last week and are also seeking the postponement of today's JCP session until a decision is made on the petitions against the 26th Amendment.The opposition PTI party in a letter to the chief justice on Sunday asked to postpone the commission's meeting.The 13-member JCP is led by the chief justice and includes four judges of the apex court, as well as parliamentarians from both the treasury and opposition and others.The lawyers and opposition allege that the government was trying to 'pack' the top judiciary with hand-picked judges to influence the fate of political cases, a concern rejected by the government.","Hundreds of lawyers stage protests in Islamabad against high-level meeting of constitutional body.

Policemen at the checkpost offered stiff resistance in an encounter which lasted two hours, following which the terrorists fled,” the provincial police said in a statement.Pakistan has experienced an escalation in militancy in KP, adjacent to Afghanistan, following the collapse of a tenuous truce between TTP and the state in Nov 2022.Pakistani authorities have linked the surge in militant violence to cross-border incursions from Afghanistan, alleging that the Kabul administration is facilitating TTP fighters, a claim Afghan authorities refute. Most of these assaults have been directed at security and law-enforcement personnel, although civilians and govt officials have also been impacted.In KP’s Dera Ismail Khan district last week, four soldiers were killed by gunfire and an improvised explosive device (IED) unleashed by terrorists.In Balochistan, another restive province in Pakistan’s south, 18 soldiers were killed in an attack by terrorists earlier this month.Islamabad think-tank Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) has described 2024 as the most lethal year for security forces in a decade, with a minimum of 685 military and police fatalities resulting from 444 terror attacks.Alongside such attacks, militants have stepped up targeted killings and kidnappings of officials in KP and Balochistan.","Nearly a dozen militants stormed a police check post at Karak district in Pakistan’s restive northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province.

ISLAMABAD : The UN refugees and migration agencies on Wednesday expressed their concern over Pakistan 's decision to deport thousands of Afghan refugees awaiting relocation to the United States and elsewhere.The UN refugee agency, UNHCR , and the international organization for migration in a statement said they were seeking clarification from Pakistan, which said last week it would deport the refugees back to Afghanistan unless their cases were processed quickly by the countries that had agreed to take them in.About 20,000 Afghans were approved for resettlement in the US under a program that helps people at risk because of their work with the American government, media, aid agencies and rights groups. They were among tens of thousands of Afghans who fled to neighboring Pakistan after their country fell to the Taliban in 2021.However, they were left in limbo after President Donald Trump paused US refugee programs last month.""A UNHCR-issued non-return advisory has been in place since 2021, calling for a suspension of forced returns of Afghan nationals from any country regardless of their status,"" the joint UNHCR-IOM statement said.Pakistan's prime minister Shehbaz Sharif last week gave the green light to evict Afghans without papers from the cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi before March 31, in preparation for deportation if they were not relocated to their host countries.UNHCR and IOM said they are especially concerned for Afghan nationals who face a risk of harm upon return, such as ethnic and religious minorities, women and girls, journalists, human rights activists, and members of artistic professions like musicians and others.It said since January 1, 2025, an uptick in arrests of Afghan nationals in Islamabad and Rawalpindi has caused significant distress, with reports of Afghan nationals of various documentation statuses being rounded up.The Trump administration also announced the US refugee admissions program would be suspended from January 27 for at least three months. It has shocked Afghans who were hoping to travel to the United States soon.Afghans in Pakistan have been virtually living in hiding since 2023 when a crackdown began on foreigners who are in the country without proper documentation. An estimated 800,000 Afghans have either gone back voluntarily or been deported since despite criticism from UN agencies, rights groups and the Taliban.Besides thousands of Afghans who are living in Pakistan and awaiting travel to host countries, there are around 1.45 million Afghan nationals registered with UNHCR as refugees in Pakistan as well but their stay has been extended until June.In the statement, UNHCR and IOM urged ""Pakistan to implement any relocation measures with due consideration for human rights standards, including due process, and the legal status of proof of registration (POR) and afghan citizen card (ACC) holders, who have resided in Pakistan for an extended period of time"".""Pakistan has a proud tradition of hosting refugees, saving millions of lives. This generosity is greatly appreciated,"" UNHCR representative in Pakistan Philippa Candler said.""IOM is committed to work with the government of Pakistan and UNHCR to develop a mechanism to register, manage and screen Afghan nationals in Pakistan,"" said IOM chief of mission, Mio Sato.She said ""This will open the door to tailored solutions including international protection to those in need and pathways for Afghan nationals, with long-standing socioeconomic and family ties in the country.""","UN refugees and migration agencies express concern over Pakistan's decision to deport thousands of Afghan refugees.

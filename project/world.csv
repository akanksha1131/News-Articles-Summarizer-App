Trump takes the stage as DJ

Mar-a-Lago became the backdrop for a festive Trump family Christmas Eve celebration, where President-elect Donald Trump took center stage as DJ. Sources told Page Six that the event, held at the private Palm Beach club, was attended by Ivanka Trump, her husband Jared Kushner, and their three children.Ivanka, 43, donned a stunning white, form-fitting dress with bare shoulders and long sleeves for the occasion, accompanied by Jared, also 43. She later shared a photo from Christmas night wearing a striking black dress with a dramatic white floral print. Melania Trump, meanwhile, opted for a chic black pantsuit paired with understated jewelry and her signature diamond wedding ring.Tickets for the Christmas Eve event reportedly sold for $350 each, though the guest list appeared somewhat selective. Notably absent were Elon Musk, Donald Trump Jr. and his girlfriend Bettina Anderson, and Eric and Lara Trump. However, Don Jr. and Anderson joined the family for Christmas Day festivities, where Anderson dazzled in a festive red dress.The highlight of the evening came when Trump assumed his role as DJ, spinning a playlist that included Andrea Bocelli’s rendition of the Phantom of the Opera theme, Elvis Presley’s “If Every Day Was Like Christmas,” and the 1978 classic “Y.M.C.A.” Trump’s signature dance moves, which have become a crowd favorite, sparked cheers and applause as some attendees joined in for the lively routine.“He played a serious set and was really into the music,” a source shared, noting that the ballroom was filled but not overcrowded, with attendance carefully limited for the holidays.","Ivanka Trump, her husband Jared Kushner, and their three children attended a Christmas Eve event at Mar-a-Lago.

OpenAI responds to ChatGPT outage as users on X joke 'Back to using our own brains',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/openai-responds-to-chatgpt-outage-as-users-on-x-joke-back-to-using-our-own-brains/articleshow/116696674.cms,"Illustration shows ChatGPT logo

X Reacts: Back to 'Using our own brains'

OpenAI’s record and the bigger picture

ChatGPT , the widely popular AI chatbot developed by OpenAI , went offline in US, leaving millions of users stranded—and sparking a wave of humor across social media.The outage began around 1:30 pm EST, according to Downdetector, with over 50,000 users reporting issues. By 3:30 pm, the reports continued to pour in, and a simple query to ChatGPT resulted in an “Internal Server Error” message. OpenAI confirmed the outage at 4:05 pm, blaming an unnamed internet service provider and promising to work on a fix.This marks the second outage for ChatGPT this month, following a six-hour blackout just two weeks ago. In June, the AI assistant also suffered technical difficulties that disrupted users for hours.Users on X (formerly Twitter) couldn’t resist poking fun at the situation. One quipped, “Back to using my own brain? No thanks.” Another joked, “When ChatGPT is down, who do I ask for my bad takes on philosophy?”Even rival chatbot Grok, hosted on X, wasn’t spared from the chaos. Some users expressed frustration, while others simply switched platforms to vent their jokes.""All i want are some practice tests,"" another user wrote, as others referenced previous occasions on which ChatGPT was down. In one, an angry commenter stated that it took four hours for the bot to get back up and running, complaining that, in the amount of time it would take OpenAI to fix the current issues, they would simply be doodling.Despite the hiccup, ChatGPT remains the most popular AI chatbot, with over 300 million weekly users and more than a billion messages exchanged daily, according to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. The platform is valued at a staggering $157 billion following its $6.6 billion funding round in October.","ChatGPT, the popular AI chatbot developed by OpenAI, went offline in US.

Ramaswamy: 'It’s about culture, not IQ'

Nikki Haley fires back

Social media sparks debate over DOGE

MAGA pushback on Krishnan’s nomination

Amid growing criticism of Sriram Krishnan's controversial stance on immigration, Republican leader Vivek Ramaswamy took to social media to defend the hiring trends in tech, emphasizing cultural factors over intellectual capabilities. In a lengthy post on social media, Ramaswamy defended the hiring of immigrant engineers in the tech industry, emphasizing that the issue is rooted in “culture, not IQ.”As criticism grew, Ramaswamy — set to co-lead the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) alongside Elon Musk — argued that the prevalence of foreign-born talent in tech stems from cultural differences.“It’s not because of an innate American IQ deficit (a lazy & wrong explanation),” Ramaswamy stated. “It all comes down to the c-word: culture. Tough questions demand tough answers, & if we’re really serious about fixing the problem, we have to confront the TRUTH.”Ramaswamy criticized American culture for celebrating mediocrity over excellence, adding, “Films glorify the prom queen, not the math Olympiad champ. That mindset won’t produce the best engineers.” He further warned, “‘Normalcy’ doesn’t cut it in a hyper-competitive global market for technical talent. If we pretend like it does, we’ll have our a**es handed to us by China.”Republican leader Nikki Haley quickly responded to Ramaswamy’s remarks, defending American workers and culture. “There is nothing wrong with American workers or American culture,” she wrote on X. “All you have to do is look at the border and see how many want what we have. We should be investing in and prioritizing Americans, not foreign workers.”Far-right influencer Laura Loomer joined the fray, criticizing DOGE as a ploy to benefit tech elites. “Is DOGE a way to ‘cut spending’ or redirect the spending toward the pet projects of tech bro billionaires?” she posted on X. “It’s looking like the latter, TBH.”Her comments ignited widespread reactions online, with one user stating, “If you are against the DOGE, you don’t want to Make America Great Again.” Another wrote, “We are not turning against Elon. He is turning against us—US citizens and voters!”Krishnan’s earlier comments supporting changes to immigration policies have also drawn criticism from MAGA supporters. Investigative journalist Laura Loomer accused him of betraying Trump’s “America First” agenda, while Trump’s crypto czar David Sacks clarified, “Sriram didn’t say he wants to remove all caps on green cards. He said he wants to remove country caps and make the program entirely merit-based.”","Republican leader Vivek Ramaswamy took to social media to defend the hiring of foreign-born engineers in the tech industry.

Michigan school shooting: Jennifer Crumbley seeks release from prison while appeal continues,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/michigan-school-shooting-jennifer-crumbley-seeks-release-from-prison-while-appeal-continues/articleshow/116694866.cms,"Jennifer Crumbley, convicted of involuntary manslaughter for her role in the deadly shooting carried out by her son at a Michigan high school, has requested to be released from prison while her appeal is ongoing.Crumbley, along with her husband, was sentenced earlier this year to 10 to 15 years in prison. She is seeking bond with her attorney, Michael Dezsi, on the grounds that she poses no threat to public safety and has not committed any further crimes.Dezsi contends that Crumbley should be granted bond, which would allow her to leave the Women's Huron Valley Correctional Facility while attending court hearings as per ABC News.“There’s no reason to keep her locked up,” he said. “She hasn’t hurt anyone, and she’s not a flight risk. This case is an overreach, blaming a parent for the problems of a whole nation.”Jennifer and her husband, James Crumbley, received these sentences in April after being convicted of four counts of involuntary manslaughter, a rare case where parents faced criminal charges in connection with a shooting committed by their child.Their son, Ethan Crumbley , was 15 years old when he opened fire at Oxford High School in 2021, killing four students. Ethan was sentenced to life in prison without parole.Dezsi described the sentence as unfair, alleging the case was influenced by secret deals with two witnesses. He further argued that keeping Jennifer Crumbley in prison would set a negative precedent and reward unjust prosecutions.""We’re not just standing up for her—we’re standing up for all Americans who could face this kind of situation someday,” he added.The court has not yet ruled on whether Crumbley will be allowed to post bond. The Oakland County Prosecutor’s Office has not yet responded to requests for comment. Prosecutors have argued that the Crumbleys ignored multiple warning signs before the shooting, with both parents purchasing the firearm used by their son and failing to secure it or limit his access to it.","Jennifer Crumbley was sentenced to 10 to 15 years in prison earlier this year for her role in the shooting death of four students at her son's high school.

JonBenét Ramsey case revived: New tips spark hope for justice after 28 years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/jonbent-ramsey-case-revived-new-tips-spark-hope-for-justice-after-28-years/articleshow/116693382.cms,"Cold Case

: Who Killed JonBenét Ramsey

Twenty-eight years after the tragic murder of JonBenét Ramsey , new leads have emerged, reigniting hope for answers in a case that has haunted the nation. The six-year-old beauty queen was found dead in the basement of her family’s Boulder home in December 1996, having been strangled and bludgeoned.Despite years of investigation, her killer remains unidentified.Since the release of the Netflix documentaryin November, the Boulder Police Department has received over 100 new tips. An investigator from the joint task force working on the case confirmed the surge in information.“The next move is to decide which ones are credible and which ones are not.” the investigator said.“But we’re looking at every single tip and deciding if it can help us solve the case. It’s a priority here.”This development offers a glimmer of hope to the Ramsey family, who have spent decades seeking justice. JonBenét’s parents, John and the late Patsy Ramsey, faced initial suspicion but were formally exonerated in 2008 following DNA evidence that cleared them and JonBenét’s brother, Burke, of involvement.John Ramsey and his son, John Andrew Ramsey, participated in the Netflix documentary, hoping to encourage anyone with knowledge to come forward.“A key reason why we continue participating in media interviews is the hope of compelling that one person who knows something to come forward,” said John Andrew, who was a teenager visiting his mother at the time of the murder.JonBenét’s death has long perplexed authorities. She was reported missing on Christmas Day 1996, and her father later discovered her body in the family’s basement. The grisly scene included a garrote around her neck and a fractured skull from a severe blow to the head.In a significant move, John Ramsey, now 80, announced plans to meet with Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn in January. Accompanied by a representative from an independent genetic genealogy lab, Ramsey aims to convince the police to allow advanced testing of crime-scene evidence.“We’ve requested a meeting with Chief Redfearn, and he’s agreed,” Ramsey told Fox News Digital.“We haven’t scheduled the day yet, but we’ll get that figured out. That’s an important meeting. We’re going to have a representative with us for one of these cutting-edge labs to explain what they can and can’t do. Hopefully, he will accept their help.”Redfearn, who recently took over as Boulder Police Chief, has expressed determination to solve the case, which remains a blemish on the department’s record.“This is a major public black mark for the Boulder Police,” the investigator admitted. “It’s in everyone’s best interest to close this case, and we’re fully committed now.”The Ramsey family is urging anyone with information to contact the authorities.“Even the smallest piece of information could be the breakthrough we need,” John Andrew Ramsey said.“Your decision to come forward could help bring us the answers we’ve been seeking for so long.”With renewed attention and advances in forensic technology, there is cautious optimism that justice for JonBenét may finally be within reach.","JonBenét Ramsey, 6, was found strangled and bludgeoned to death in 1996.

Azerbaijan Airlines passenger plane crashes in Kazakhstan

Nearby Russian airport closed



A survivor of crashed Azerbaijan Airlines flight managed to record footage from inside the cabin on Wednesday. The Azerbaijan Airlines plane with 62 passengers and five crew on board crashed in Kazakhstan.Kazakh authorities announced that 32 survivors were rescued from the site.Azerbaijan Airlines flight J2-8243 had flown hundreds of miles off its scheduled route to crash on the opposite shore of the Caspian Sea, after what Russia's aviation watchdog said was an emergency that may have been caused by a bird strike.A video shot by a survivor showed the aftermath of the crash from inside the cabin while a man tried to get out of the wreckage.Meanwhile, Azerbaijan Airlines suspended all its flights from Baku to Russia's Chechnya region until an investigation into the fatal crash is finished.Another video showed a passenger repeating ""Allahu Akbar"" (God is great) as the plane plunged into a steep descent. Yellow oxygen masks were seen dangling from overhead compartments, while cries and screams echoed throughout the cabin.Officials have yet to clarify the reasons behind the plane's sea crossing, but the crash occurred shortly after drone strikes targeted southern Russia. In the past, drone activity has led to airport closures in the region, and the nearest Russian airport along the flight path was shut down on Wednesday morning.Footage of the crash captured the aircraft plunging rapidly before erupting into flames upon impact with the seashore. Thick black smoke billowed into the sky, while passengers, visibly injured and shaken, stumbled away from a section of the fuselage that remained intact.Kazakhstan's emergencies ministry issued a statement confirming that fire services had extinguished the blaze. Survivors, including two children, were receiving medical attention at a nearby hospital. Efforts were underway to recover the bodies of the deceased.Azerbaijan Airlines reported that the Embraer 190 jet had been en route from Baku to Grozny, the capital of Chechnya in southern Russia. However, an emergency forced the aircraft to attempt a landing approximately 3 kilometers (1.8 miles) from Aktau, Kazakhstan.According to Russia’s aviation watchdog, “Preliminary findings suggest a collision with birds caused an emergency situation on board, prompting the pilot to divert to an alternate airfield. Aktau was selected.”Aktau, located on the eastern shore of the Caspian Sea, lies across from Azerbaijan and Russia. Flight tracking websites showed the aircraft initially following its planned route along the western coastline before its signal was lost. The flight later reappeared on the eastern shore, circling near Aktau airport before crashing on the beach.Meanwhile, drone strikes were reported in the Russian regions of Ingushetia and North Ossetia, adjacent to Chechnya, on Wednesday morning. An official at Makhachkala airport, the nearest to the flight's last known location, confirmed it had been closed to incoming traffic for several hours. Attempts to reach officials at Grozny airport were unsuccessful.Kazakh authorities announced the formation of a government commission to investigate the crash. Members of the commission were directed to the crash site to oversee the investigation and ensure support for the victims’ families. Kazakhstan pledged to collaborate with Azerbaijan on the inquiry.Russian President Vladimir Putin and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev extended their condolences. President Aliyev decided to return home from Russia, where he had been scheduled to attend a summit on Wednesday.Ramzan Kadyrov, the Kremlin-backed leader of Chechnya, also expressed his sympathies. He noted that some of the injured were in critical condition and urged prayers for their recovery.","Azerbaijan Airlines flight J2-8243 crashed near Aktau, Kazakhstan, on Wednesday. 32 survivors were rescued from the crash site.

Canada Flagpoling Ban: Canada flagpoling policy 2024: Canada Ends Flagpoling for Work and Study Permits: Key Implications Explained,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/canada-ends-flagpoling-for-work-and-study-permits-what-it-means/articleshow/116657872.cms,"Representative image

Reasons behind ban

Limited exemptions

Citizens or permanent residents of the United States.

Professionals and technicians under free trade agreements with countries such as the United States, Mexico, Chile, Panama, Peru, Colombia, and South Korea.

Spouses or common-law partners of professionals under these agreements.

International truck drivers leaving Canada for work who held maintained status due to a timely renewal application.

Individuals with pre-existing CBSA appointments for permit processing.

Canada has officially ended the practice of flagpoling for work and study permits at its ports of entry.Effective from December 23 at 11.59 pm ET, foreign nationals holding temporary resident status in Canada must submit renewal applications through Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) instead of re-entering Canada after briefly leaving for expedited immigration services, according to a statement by the Canada Border Services Agency .Flagpoling has long been used by temporary residents to bypass typical processing wait times for work and study permits. However, Canadian authorities now aim to streamline port operations and enhance border enforcement.“This change will enable us to further streamline activities at our ports of entry and allow Canadian and American border officers to focus on what they have been expertly trained to do – border enforcement,” public safety minister David McGuinty said in a statement, as reported by CBC News.Flagpoling has placed a significant burden on Canadian and American border services. Between April 1, 2023, and March 31, 2024, the CBSA processed over 69,300 flagpolers, primarily in regions like the Pacific, southern Ontario, and Quebec, according to CIC News.The CBSA emphasised that border services are intended for individuals entering Canada rather than those already in the country. Diverting resources for flagpolers has added congestion and hindered critical border enforcement activities.“A strong Canada-US relationship keeps people and goods moving safely while protecting both sides of the border,” immigration minister Marc Miller said, adding that the policy shift would enhance fairness, ease border congestion, and improve overall border efficiency.Certain groups will still qualify for port-of-entry processing under specific circumstances:Those who attempt to flagpole without meeting these criteria will be redirected to IRCC for their applications.The policy is likely part of a broader initiative to bolster Canada-US border security . The Liberal government's fall economic update allocated $1.3 billion over six years for measures like drones, helicopters, and improved monitoring of the shared border. The changes also come amid concerns over potential US tariffs.Flagpoling, once a viable option for expediting permits, is now phased out to prioritize border security and efficient management. Applicants are being urged to use IRCC’s online services for work or study permit renewals moving forward.","Canada has officially ended the practice of flagpoling for work and study permits at its ports of entry.Effective from December 23 at 11.59 pm ET, foreign nationals holding temporary resident status in Canada must submit renewal applications through Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada.

British-Indian writer says he had a chat with Luigi Mangione: 'His major concern was...',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/british-indian-writer-says-he-had-a-chat-with-luigi-mangione-his-major-concern-was-/articleshow/116656189.cms,"Luigi Mangione was concerned about 'non-playing characters' and identified himself as one, a writer revealed.

Agency was a major concern of Luigi's

'I was sickened. Vigilantism is always wrong'

'I didn't know he had spinal or mental issues'

British-Indian writer Gurwinder Bhogal has claimed that long before the shocking murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, he had a video call and a chat with accused Luigi Mangione around April-May when Mangione was vacationing in Japan.The author described how Luigi Mangione reached out to him through membership of his blog and was warm and gregarious. Mangione told him that he was on holiday in Japan and loved the culture there -- its sense of honor. ""One morning in Japan, he saw a man having a seizure in the street, so he ran to the nearest police station for help. They followed him back to the man, but refused to cross any street if the stoplight was red—even if the road was empty—as the man was seizing on the ground. Mangione lamented what he called “a lack of free will” in Japan, by which he meant a lack of agency,"" Bhogal described an anecdote from his interaction with Mangione.""I quickly realised that agency was a major concern of Luigi’s,"" the writer added.""Luigi believed people everywhere were becoming NPCs (Non-player characters -- people who don't think for themselves), increasingly living their lives as a series of reflex reactions rather than consciously choosing their behaviours. The West was following closely behind Japan, driven by tech companies intent on mesmerising us into servile consumers. Luigi feared that once we’d surrendered our agency, we’d surrender everything else,"" Bhogal wrote.Mangione too identified as an NPC living much of his life on autopilot, he told the author recalling how he sometimes wasted whole afternoons doomscrolling social media. ""He said he wanted to regain some of the agency he felt he'd lost to online distractions, so we spent much of the chat discussing ways he could become more active,"" the writer wrote adding that he thought Mangione was someone who had a desire to help even those whom he didn't know.The writer then described how he withdrew himself from social media and didn't notice that Mangione vanished and then came the murder and the social media glorification of the alleged murderer. ""If you celebrate someone gunning down a defenseless person in the street, then you advocate for a world in which this is an acceptable thing for anyone to do. You, in fact, advocate for a world in which a stranger can decide that you’re also a bad person, and gun you down in the street. In such a world, I promise you, your health insurance would cost much more,"" Bhogal wrote.The writer said that in his limited interactions with Mangione, he never got the impression he had spinal or mental issues. ""But I did get the sense he felt alienated. He often decried the lack of social connection in the modern world, and on a couple of occasions, he lamented that the people around him were 'on a different wavelength' to him,"" he wrote.","British-Indian writer Gurwinder Bhogal has claimed that long before the shocking murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, he had a video call and a chat with accused Luigi Mangione.

TOI Correspondent from Washington:

A fierce skirmish has broken out in the Trumpworld between his so-called ""tech cabal"" and MAGA nativists, with Indian-Americans and Indian immigrants caught in a crossfire that has taken on an ugly racist tone.The trigger for the firefight is the announcement by MAGA supremo Donald Trump that Indian-American Sriram Krishnan would serve as the White House policy advisor on Artificial Intelligence, a pick that stirred disquiet in nativist sections of the MAGA world already in ferment over the perceived influence on Trump of ""big tech"" led by Elon Musk Soon, MAGA radicals like Trump acolyte Laura Loomer, banished from the President-elect's inner circle but still loyal to him, were questioning the pick. ""Deeply disturbing to see the appointment of Sriram Krishnan @sriramk as Senior Policy Advisor for AI at the Office of Science and Technology Policy. It’s alarming to see the number of career leftists who are now being appointed to serve in Trump’s admin when they share views that are in direct opposition to Trump’s America First agenda,"" Loomer said in a post on X.Loomer and other MAGA nativists also cherry-picked Krishnan's past posts and podcasts to characterize him as being an India loyalist who was arguing to increase guest worker visas and green card caps for Indians in a bid to exploit the US at the expense of native-born Americans.""This is very troubling. Mind you, none of the tech executives who are meeting with Trump and getting appointed in his cabinet supported him in 2020 or during the 2024 primary. I feel like many of them are trying to get into Trump’s admin to enrich themselves and get contracts at DOD,"" Loomer wrote, in a series of posts that also included rank racist attacks on India and Indians and was also aimed at Elon Musk, increasingly perceived as the most influential person in the Trump circle.Musk in turn defended Trump's choice of Sriram, his longtime associate, making the broader argument that the US needs to attract the best and the brightest from across the world to maintain its global primacy. He also endorsed the proposition that skilled immigration, and Indian-Americans in particular, have contributed enormously to the US economy, reposting charts that show them having the highest median income of all ethnic cohorts, almost double that of white Americans.Krishnan also found support from other major tech principals, including David Sacks, Trump's appointed crypto czar, who Trump has tasked Krishnan to work with.""Sriram has been a US citizen for a decade. He’s not “running America.” He’s advising on A.I. policy. He will have no influence over US immigration policy. These attacks have become crude, and not in the holiday spirit,"" Sacks said in a post pushing back at the dodgy MAGA narrative, based on Sriram's posts, that he could have a role in immigration policy too.Sacks also argued that Krishnan had worked with him and Elon Musk to restore free speech on Twitter and get MAGA their accounts back at a time the platform was said to have been run by leftists and liberals.Lawmakers too jumped into the fray with Democrats rushing to defend the immigration policies that allowed Krishnan to study, work and rise in the US. ""Sriram embodies the American Dream—talent, hard work, and contribution to something bigger than himself. The people attacking him aren’t critiquing his credentials; they’re exposing their own insecurities. America succeeds when it embraces merit, not when it panders to bitterness,"" Richie Torres, a NewYork lawmaker said.From Silicon Valley's Indian-American Congressman Ro Khanna:""You fools criticizing @sriramk as Indian born criticize Musk as South African born or Jensen as Taiwanese born. It is GREAT that talent around the world wants to come here, not to China, & that Sriram can rise to the highest levels. It's called American exceptionalism.""Loomer and other MAGA hardliners however descended into a racist rabbithole with crude posts about Indians, arguing that foreign-born executives like Sriram ""view Western nations as economic zones and nothing more"" and ""people like this have no business holding positions of power in the American government."" Regarded as toxic flame-thrower even in Trump circles, Loomer also made derogatory references to India.""You shouldn’t be happy about mocking the MAGA base, posting anti-White hatred and saying America can’t be exceptional without Indians. Big Tech executives want to see Trump abandon his base for them. Trump will choose his base. Because we have been loyal to him. And loyalty matters,"" she wrote.Absent from the MAGA narrative about Indian pre-ponderence and influence in the tech world is the fact that the US just does not produce sufficient number of qualified STEM graduates to meet the country's need, not to speak of its desire to maintain global primacy.Musk himself highlighted a post in this regard that read, ""As an American with a masters in aerospace engineering, I can tell you there are not enough of us. My graduation at UF (University of Florida) was literally about 600 Indians and 10 Americans. The classes weren’t rejecting American students, there was simply not enough supply,""","Indian-American Sriram Krishnan is the White House policy advisor on Artificial Intelligence.

History of 'substance abuse'

New York Times

Sebastian Zapeta-Calil , the Guatemalan migrant charged with setting a sleeping woman on fire aboard a Brooklyn subway train, was known for his erratic behaviour after smoking K2 (synthetic drug) and drinking heavily, claimed his roommate at a homeless shelter where he lived.Zapeta-Calil, 33, was arraigned Tuesday in Brooklyn Criminal Court on first-degree murder and arson charges for the shocking attack early Sunday morning that left the unidentified woman dead. Surveillance footage captured Zapeta-Calil sitting on a bench watching as flames consumed the victim.Raymond Robinson, who shared a dormitory with Zapeta-Calil at the Samaritan Village Forbell men’s shelter in East New York, described him as a heavy user of K2 and a frequent drinker.""He smoked K2, drank, and bugged out,"" theRobinson. “He would bug out and talk to himself when he was high, but he never harmed nobody or himself. When he wasn’t high, he’d talk like we’re talking regular”, Robinson added.Despite his unpredictable behaviour, Robinson said Zapeta-Calil often came across as quiet and respectful.

Say you just came in and needed some socks, he’d help you out,"" Robinson said, adding, “That’s why this s**t f***ed my head up because I slept next to him, and he was never like that.”""I wouldn’t leave my daughter with anybody but he was the type of dude I could trust, as long as he wasn’t high”, Robinson added.The brutal attack unfolded at the Coney Island-Stillwell Avenue station. Police said Zapeta-Calil approached the sleeping woman, set her clothes on fire with a lighter, and then used a shirt to fan the flames, as captured in video evidence.Prosecutors allege that Zapeta-Calil watched the woman burn while sitting calmly on a bench. The victim was pronounced dead at the scene, with authorities citing ""thermal injuries and smoke inhalation"" as the cause of death.Other residents at the shelter painted a complex picture of Zapeta-Calil, describing him as someone who frequently drank cheap vodka and smoked K2. According to the, he was deported to Guatemala in 2018 but later returned illegally to the United States.As per the New York Post, José Acosta, another shelter resident, said Zapeta-Calil worked in construction and regularly sent money back to his family in Guatemala. But others described him as increasingly dishevelled and distant in recent weeks.Juan Medrano, who also lived at the shelter, said Zapeta-Calil was often ""in his own world"" but noted he had never been in trouble there before.Zapeta-Calil remains in custody without bail as prosecutors detail evidence of his actions. He reportedly told police he was so intoxicated that he doesn’t remember the attack.","Sebastian Zapeta-Calil, 33, is accused of setting a sleeping woman on fire aboard a Brooklyn subway train. His roommate at a homeless shelter where he lived described him as a heavy user of K2 (synthetic drug) and a frequent drinker.

Volcanoes are one of the fiery masterpieces by nature, and some countries have more eruptions than others. From the rumbling peaks of the Pacific Ring of Fire to smoldering craters in distant corners of the world, these active volcanoes add drama and awe to the landscape. Which countries have the most active volcanoes? These are geological hotspots that represent more than natural wonders-they remind the world of Earth's unpredictable power. Be it a thrill-seeking traveler or an enthusiast of geology, visiting these volcano-rich regions provides one with a front-row seat to one of nature's most spectacular shows. From towering giants in Indonesia to the vibrant eruptions in Italy, let's explore the top five countries where earth's molten core is constantly making its presence felt. Prepare yourself to delve into an amazing world of active volcanoes.It is the opening in the earth's crust that allows for molten rock, ash, and gases to pass from beneath the surface to be free and it comes up because the magma from the interior rises through cracks in the Earth's crust and leads to eruptions that may form landforms such as mountains or islands. Volcanoes generally occur at the boundaries of tectonic plates where the plates converge or diverge, but they may also occur within plates. The materials ejected during an eruption can accumulate over time to form such structures as cones, domes, or calderas. Volcanic activity is a major geological process that shapes the Earth's landscape and can have extreme effects on the environment and climate.Chile has approximately 90 active volcanoes, putting it as one of the most volcanic countries in the world. The volcanoes are situated mainly along the Andes Mountain Range, which runs throughout the length of the country. The volcanic activity of Chile is due to the subduction of the Nazca Plate under the South American Plate, leading to regular eruptions. Some of Chile's most famous active volcanoes are Mount Villarrica, Mount Llaima, and Mount Calbuco, all of which have erupted in the recent past. These volcanoes shape the terrain as well as provide fertile ground. The National Geology and Mining Service (SERNAGEOMIN) regularly monitors Chile's volcanoes, thereby helping to bring out early warnings to help reduce the risks of an eruption. The geologists give these volcanic rocks in Chile a geological importance; to a tourist, it becomes important for visiting purposes owing to its scenery.Japan, along the Pacific Ring of Fire, hosts 111 active volcanoes that represent approximately 10% of the world's active volcanoes. Its tectonic location is at a convergent boundary of many plates, resulting in periodic eruptions and earthquakes. Its most prominent volcanoes are Mount Fuji, Mount Sakurajima, and Mount Aso. Mount Fuji is an iconic symbol of Japan, a dormant stratovolcano that last erupted in 1707. Mount Sakurajima, located in Kagoshima Bay, is one of the most active volcanoes in the country, with frequent eruptions that impact the surrounding region. Mount Aso, located on the island of Kyushu, is one of the world's largest active volcanoes, featuring a massive caldera and multiple active craters. Volcanic activity in Japan is usually associated with earthquakes, because tectonic movements may cause both events at the same time. Advanced monitoring and preparedness systems in the country are crucial for the management of these natural hazards.Russia is known to feature around 120 active volcanoes, and most lie in the far easternmost part of the country- the Kamchatka Peninsula. It is largely a hotspot area because, being located at the area of the Pacific Ring of Fire where its tectonic plates have been known to subduct beneath the North American as well as the Eurasia plates, mainly the one that has Pacific Plate inside. The Kamchatka Peninsula is home to some of Russia's most famous volcanoes, including Klyuchevskaya Sopka, Shiveluch, and Tolbachik. These volcanoes are part of the region's dramatic landscape, which has been recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage site for its natural beauty and geological importance. In addition to Kamchatka, volcanic activity also occurs on the Kuril Islands and parts of Sakhalin Island. The eruptions in Russia are awe-inspiring but, on the other hand, also pose a risk to communities and ecosystems close by. Monitoring the volcanoes in the country ensures the activity and the issuance of early warnings if necessary.Indonesia has around 130 active volcanoes, making it the country with the highest number of active volcanoes in the world. This volcanic activity is due to Indonesia's location along the Pacific Ring of Fire, where several tectonic plates, including the Eurasian, Pacific, and Indo-Australian plates, converge. The movement and subduction of these plates cause frequent volcanic eruptions and earthquakes. Some of Indonesia's most notable and highly active volcanoes include Mount Merapi, Mount Sinabung, and Mount Krakatoa. These are particularly infamous for their violent eruptions that have had a direct influence on the populations in the locality and on the environment as well. While volcanic eruptions are dangerous, the soil created by the volcanoes is very fertile, which has promoted agriculture in Indonesia. Indonesia's government watches its active volcanoes very closely through an extensive network of sensors and observation systems, which helps to give early warnings and reduce risks to communities living close to these natural wonders.The United States harbors 169 active volcanoes, most of which lie in Alaska and Hawaii. Alaska alone contains some 130 active volcanoes, with most situated along the Aleutian Islands. This is mostly caused by the subduction of the Pacific Plate beneath the North American Plate. Hawaii is famous for its huge volcanoes, and indeed has many active ones; it is home to the highly active Kilauea on Big Island and Mauna Loa, the largest volcano in volume on Earth. The very active Kilauea erupts frequently, whereas Mauna Loa also has had significant recent eruptions. In addition to Alaska and Hawaii, the Pacific Northwest, which includes Mount St. Helens in Washington State, is another volcanic hotbed in the United States. These volcanoes are part of the very active region known as the Pacific Ring of Fire for intense seismic and volcanic activity.","Volcanoes are geological hotspots that represent more than natural wonders-they remind the world of Earth's unpredictable power.

'Jew moment' for PIOs? MAGA backers vent anti-Indian ire,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/jew-moment-for-pios-maga-backers-vent-anti-indian-ire/articleshow/116696891.cms,"Jagdish Bhagwati , the influential economist who's taught at MIT and Columbia in the US for over half a century, once described Indians as the new Jews in America, successful in all fields except the mafia. He may have meant it in a lighter vein, but there's lots of data to back up what he said. The Indian-American community is easily the most successful ethnic minority in the US, with members occupying prominent positions in govt, business and academia, among other fields. Its annual median household income of about $145,000 in 2022 was almost double the US household median income of $77,540 (the median income for White households was pegged at $80,320).Sadly, the comparison with Jews may be taking a grimmer turn. The Jewish community has faced resentment and envy precisely because of its very visible success. PIOs have so far, been largely applauded as a model minority , but that could be changing as Donald Trump's MAGA (Make America Great Again) support base eyes highly skilled, well-paid PIOs with increasing hostility.A turning point may potentially have been reached with the firestorm of criticism that erupted after Trump named Chennai-born Sriram Krishnan as his Senior Policy Adviser for AI.","The Indian-American community is easily the most successful ethnic minority in the US.

Pizza delivery worker stabs pregnant woman over $2 tip in Florida,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/pizza-delivery-worker-stabs-pregnant-woman-over-2-tip-in-florida/articleshow/116693910.cms,"A Florida pizza delivery worker has been charged with attempted murder after allegedly stabbing a pregnant woman more than a dozen times over a $2 tip. Brianna Alvelo, 22, reportedly became enraged when the customer at the Riviera Motel in Kissimmee gave her only a small tip after a $33 pizza order.According to the Osceola County Sheriff’s Office, Alvelo returned to the motel around 10 p.m. on Sunday with a masked accomplice, armed with a knife. The pair attacked the woman, who was at the motel celebrating a birthday with her boyfriend and 5-year-old daughter. Alvelo allegedly stabbed the victim 14 times before fleeing the scene, as per the New York Post.The incident occurred after the victim, unable to provide exact change for the $50 bill she gave to Alvelo, ended up giving just $2. Security footage showed Alvelo arriving with her red Toyota, and returning later with her companion, who was reportedly armed with a gun. During the attack, the victim attempted to protect her daughter, but was struck in the back by the intruders. In a desperate bid, she threw her daughter onto the bed and tried to call for help, only for Alvelo to smash her phone.Following the attack, the victim was rushed to a local hospital, where she was listed in stable condition. It was later revealed that she was pregnant. Police quickly located Alvelo, who was arrested and charged with attempted murder, home invasion, assault, and kidnapping. However, her accomplice remains at large.Alvelo, who worked for Marco's Pizza, was denied bond and booked into Osceola County Jail. The owners of the pizza chain issued an apology, expressing their sadness over the tragic incident. They assured the public that they are cooperating fully with the authorities as the investigation continues.“The safety and well-being of customers and team members are always our top priority,” the company said in a statement.","Brianna Alvelo, 22, charged with attempted murder after allegedly stabbing pregnant woman more than a dozen times over a $2 tip.

TSA shocked as woman caught with 82 prohibited items at LAX airport,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/tsa-shocked-as-woman-caught-with-82-prohibited-items-at-lax-airport/articleshow/116692431.cms,"A woman from Los Angeles left Transportation Security Administration (TSA) agents stunned after her carry-on bag was found carrying more than 80 prohibited items.The discovery took place around 10 pm at terminal 4 of Los Angeles International Airport , as per Newsweek.TSA agents found 82 consumer-grade fireworks, three knives, two replica firearms, and one canister of pepper spray in the bag.Jason Pantages, the federal security director for TSA at LAX, voiced serious concern over the find.""The sheer number of prohibited items discovered in a single carry-on bag is extremely concerning,"" he said.""Let this incident serve as a reminder to all travelers to double-check the contents of your bag prior to coming to the airport.""Soon after the shocking discovery, TSA agents contacted Los Angeles World Airport police, who quickly interviewed the woman. The airport bomb squad also arrived to confiscate the fireworks. All prohibited items were seized.The TSA further explained that knives and replica firearms should only be packed in checked luggage, and pepper spray is allowed in checked bags only if the container is 4 ounces or smaller and equipped with a safety mechanism, according to the New York Post.A TSA spokesperson commented on the unusual nature of the find as a passenger had multiple prohibited items in a single carry-on bag.“It stands as a testament to the skills of our professional Transportation Security Officers in preventing dangerous items from reaching security checkpoints.""They added that the TSA is always vigilant about prohibited items and works tirelessly to ensure they do not enter secure airport areas.Some airlines do not permit pepper spray, so the TSA advised travellers to check with their airline before flying. Self-defense sprays containing more than 2 percent tear gas are banned, even in checked baggage.""This traveller should have followed TSA’s tried and true advice—unpack your bag before you pack it to ensure you don’t bring any prohibited items to the security checkpoint,"" Pantages said.He further added that as it is the middle of a holiday travel season, security checkpoints will be busy everywhere.For those uncertain about what items are allowed on planes, the TSA recommended downloading the ""MyTSA"" app, which includes a ""What Can I Bring?"" feature. Alternatively, travellers can send a picture of an item to @AskTSA on X or Facebook Messenger for real-time assistance.","TSA agents found 82 consumer-grade fireworks, three knives, two replica firearms, and one canister of pepper spray in a woman's carry-on bag.

'This can be our Sputnik moment': Vivek Ramaswamy says cultural shift needed in US for better competition in tech,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/this-can-be-our-sputnik-moment-vivek-ramaswamy-says-cultural-shift-needed-in-us-for-better-competition-in-tech/articleshow/116691026.cms,"Entrepreneur and political figure, Vivek Ramaswamy , recently addressed the reasons why top tech companies often hire foreign-born and first-generation engineers amid ongoing controversy surrounding immigration and high-skilled worker visas .Posting on his social media account on X, he also emphasised that the issue is not because of an IQ difference, but rather a cultural one.“Top tech companies often hire foreign-born & first-generation engineers over “native” Americans isn’t because of an innate American IQ deficit (a lazy & wrong explanation). A key part of it comes down to the c-word: culture. Tough questions demand tough answers & if we’re really serious about fixing the problem, we have to confront the TRUTH”Ramaswamy said that American culture has long celebrated mediocrity over excellence, a trend that dates back at least to the 90s, if not earlier. He also argued that this mindset doesn't begin in college but is instilled from a young age.“A culture that celebrates the prom queen over the math olympiad champ, or the jock over the valedictorian, will not produce the best engineers,” he stated.He further argued that a culture which favours characters like Cory from ""Boy Meets World,"" Zach and Slater from ""Saved by the Bell,"" or Stefan over Steve Urkel from ""Family Matters"" will not produce the best engineers.He mentioned that he knows several immigrant parents from the 90s who deliberately restricted how much TV their children could watch, as they believed shows promoting mediocrity hindered success. Their children, he pointed out, went on to become highly successful STEM graduates.“More movies like Whiplash, fewer reruns of “Friends.” More math tutoring, fewer sleepovers. More weekend science competitions, fewer Saturday morning cartoons. More books, less TV. More creating, less “chillin.” More extracurriculars, less “hanging out at the mall.”The Republican also stated that while most typical American parents view ""those kinds of parents"" with scepticism, if people grow up aiming for normalcy, that is what they will ultimately achieve.He also asked the public to compare the families that raised their kids according to different models.“Normalcy” doesn’t cut it in a hyper-competitive global market for technical talent. And if we pretend like it does, we’ll have our asses handed to us by China.”The Republican politician also said that under Trump’s presidency America can soar to its golden heights again provided that the culture “wakes up” and prioritizes achievement over normalcy, excellence over mediocrity, nerdiness over conformity and hard work over laziness.“That’s the work we have cut out for us, rather than wallowing in victimhood & just wishing (or legislating) alternative hiring practices into existence. I’m confident we can do it.”Ramaswamy is set to lead the newly established Department of Government Efficiency alongside billionaire Elon Musk during Trump’s second term. Born on August 9, 1985, in Cincinnati, Ohio, Vivek Ramaswamy is a biotech entrepreneur, author, and former Republican presidential candidate.He is best known for founding Roivant Sciences in 2014, where he built his wealth by acquiring and advancing underdeveloped pharmaceutical companies. Ramaswamy gained national attention for his outspoken views on corporate America's involvement in social issues and his criticism of environmental, social, and governance investing.","Vivek Ramaswamy is a biotech entrepreneur, author, and former Republican presidential candidate.

At least 10 people were killed and hundreds injured during the May 9 riots, while approximately 40 public buildings and military installations were damaged, including the Lahore corps commander’s House (Jinnah House) and Askari Tower in Lahore, the army’s general headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi, Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) office in Faisalabad, the Radio Pakistan building in Peshawar, a toll plaza on the Swat motorway, and a PAF base in Imran’s hometown of Mianwali.Imran and his party have called for a judicial probe into last year’s events, claiming that violence on May 9 was a “false flag” operation aimed at crushing PTI.

May 9 Riots and aftermath

International outcry

Pakistan's response

Pakistan's military courts have sentenced 60 more civilians to prison for their alleged involvement in the violent May 9, 2023, riots that targeted military sites and other facilities following the arrest of former Prime Minister Imran Khan This brings the total number of convictions related to the unrest to 85, according to announcements from the military’s Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).Among those sentenced is Hassan Niazi , Khan’s nephew, who received a 10-year prison term for his alleged role in the attack on the Lahore Corps Commander’s residence, also known as Jinnah House.The ISPR stated that the Field General Court Martial handed down the sentences after reviewing evidence and ensuring due process. “Sequel to the announcement of the May 9 punishments... the Field General Court Martial has promulgated the punishments to the following remaining 60 culprits after examining all evidence, ensuring the provision of all legal rights to the convicts, completion of due process, and the appropriate legal proceedings,” the ISPR announced.The convicted individuals face sentences ranging from two to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment. They have the right to appeal the decisions under Pakistan's Constitution.The unrest on May 9 erupted after Imran Khan’s arrest in a corruption case. Supporters of Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party allegedly attacked key military installations, including the Army General Headquarters in Rawalpindi, the Corps Commander’s House in Lahore, and an ISI office in Faisalabad.In response, authorities detained hundreds of individuals, and 103 were handed over to military courts for trial, sparking widespread criticism of the opaque judicial process.The convictions have drawn sharp rebukes from international entities, including the United States, United Kingdom, and the European Union. Critics argue that the use of military courts to try civilians undermines judicial independence and transparency.“These military courts lack judicial independence, transparency, and due process guarantees,” the US State Department said. Similarly, the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth, and Development Office (FCO) criticized the lack of transparency and independent oversight in the trials, emphasizing the importance of adhering to fair trial standards under international law.The European Union also expressed concern, highlighting that Pakistan’s actions contradict its obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and commitments tied to the GSP+ trade program.The Pakistani government has defended the use of military courts, citing the Supreme Court’s decision that allowed the military to proceed with trials of civilians involved in the riots. The Foreign Office reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to international human rights obligations, asserting that the trials were conducted in accordance with national laws.The ISPR emphasized that the convictions reflect the military’s resolve to uphold justice and maintain the authority of the state, stating, “The Nation, Government, and Armed Forces remain steadfast in their commitment to upholding justice and ensuring that the inviolable writ of the state is maintained.”","Pakistan's military courts have sentenced 60 more civilians to prison for their alleged involvement in the violent May 9, 2023, riots.

Pakistan Airstrikes Afghanistan: Kabul claims Pak airstrikes killed 46 civilians in Afghanistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/kabul-claims-pak-airstrikes-killed-46-civilians-in-afghanistan/articleshow/116661701.cms,"ISLAMABAD: The interim Afghan Taliban govt claimed on Wednesday that 46 people, mostly women and children, were killed in airstrikes by Pakistani fighter jets on civilians in eastern Afghanistan late Tuesday night.Pakistani security officials said the airstrikes took place in Murgha and Laman areas of Barmal district, in Afghanistan’s eastern Paktika province near Pakistan’s volatile South Waziristan tribal district, on alleged camps of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). This has been the fourth time in the past few years that Pakistan has conducted airstrikes inside Afghanistan, and the second time since March 2024.“Last night (Tuesday), Pakistan bombarded four points in Barmal district of Paktika province. The total number of dead is 46, most of whom were children and women,” said Zabihullah Mujahid, spokesperson for the Afghan Taliban govt. He added that six others, mostly children, were wounded.Condemning the airstrikes, the Afghan defence ministry called them “barbaric” and a clear “aggression”. It stated that several refugees, including women and children, were killed and injured. “The Pakistani side should understand that such arbitrary measures are not a solution to any problem,” Enayatullah Khowarazami, spokesperson for Afghanistan’s defence ministry, wrote on social media platform ‘X’. “The Islamic Emirate (Afghan Taliban regime) will not leave this cowardly act unanswered, but rather considers the defence of its territory and sovereignty to be its inalienable right,” he added.The strikes took place hours after Pakistan special representative for Afghanistan Mohammad Sadiq met interim Afghan foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi and interior minister Sirajuddin Haqqani in Kabul, intending to resume diplomatic dialogue after a year-long gap. The deteriorating ties, however, are likely to worsen following Tuesday night’s airstrikes, analysts said.Pakistan alleges the Afghan government harbours armed groups, particularly the TTP, which conducts cross-border assaults against Pakistani security forces. In one of the worst recent assaults on security forces, the TTP had claimed responsibility for the killing of at least 16 Pakistani soldiers in South Waziristan last week.Kabul, however, denies providing shelter to armed groups or allowing their territory to be used for cross-border attacks.Border tensions between the two countries have surged since the Taliban regime took control in 2021, with Pakistan experiencing a revival of militant activity along its western border. Deadly air attacks by Pakistan’s military in Afghan border regions in March, which the Taliban claimed killed eight civilians, had sparked confrontations along the the disputed border between the two countries.","Pakistani security officials said the airstrikes took place in Murgha and Laman areas of Barmal district, in Afghanistan’s eastern Paktika province.

ISLAMABAD: A Pakistani minister on Wednesday defended the military trial of civilians, saying that such courts were competent to deal with the cases related to attacks on army facilities.Information minister Attaullah Tarar also urged the opposition Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) led by Imran Khan to refrain from politicising or disputing the issue of military trials.""When an attack is carried out on a defence institution or its property is set ablaze, it becomes the responsibility of the relevant authorities to apprehend the culprits. Just as railway police handle crimes on railway premises, military courts address offences targeting military assets. So, when attacks on military assets occur, the Military Act is enforced,"" he said while addressing a press conference.Tarar criticised Khan's party for using military courts as a political tool, aiming to create controversy around them. He clarified that military courts only handle cases involving attacks on defence establishments, citing incidents such as the attack on the Corps Commander's House in Lahore.The minister also criticised the PTI for changing its stance regarding trials of civilians in the military courts, recalling that during Khan's tenure, military court trials were praised.""The statements praising the military courts from PTI's leadership are still available on social media. Yet now, the same individuals are lobbying internationally against these courts,"" Tarar said.He assured that military trials adhere to fair trial principles and dismissed claims of injustice in military trials.The military courts tasked to hear cases of suspects involved in the attacks on military facilities on the May 9, 2023 protest last week sentenced 25 civilians to prison terms ranging from 2-10 years.Khan's party criticized the verdicts, arguing that military courts have no jurisdiction over civilians.",Information minister Attaullah Tarar says military courts are competent to deal with cases related to attacks on army facilities.

Maleel, a resident of Barmal, said, “The bombardment hit two or three houses. In one house, 18 people were killed, the whole family lost their lives.” He added that three people were killed in another house, with several wounded taken to hospital.Similar Pakistani air attacks in March reportedly killed eight civilians, leading to border skirmishes. Tensions have grown since the Taliban took control of Afghanistan in 2021, with Pakistan accusing Kabul of harbouring militants responsible for attacks on Pakistani soil. Kabul has denied the allegations.The latest strike follows a recent raid claimed by the Pakistani Taliban (TTP) near the Afghan border, which Islamabad intelligence said killed 16 soldiers.On the same day as the air strikes, high-ranking Taliban officials were meeting with Pakistan's special envoy for Afghanistan in Kabul.

Pakistan has repeatedly accused the Afghan Taliban of providing shelter to TTP fighters, who have increased attacks on Pakistani forces in recent months. In response, the Afghan Taliban denies these allegations, asserting that civilians, not militants, were targeted in the latest strikes.“The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan considers this a brutal act against all international principles and blatant aggression and strongly condemns it,” said the Afghan ministry of defence. “The Islamic Emirate will not leave this cowardly act unanswered but rather considers the defense of its territory to be its inalienable right.”Islamabad contends that many TTP leaders and fighters have fled to Afghanistan, finding refuge in border provinces under Taliban protection. Afghan officials, however, have refuted these claims, stating that the victims of the bombings were primarily displaced civilians.The strikes came just after Mohammad Sadiq, Pakistan’s special representative for Afghanistan, visited Kabul for discussions on trade and bilateral relations. The timing has fueled speculation about a deterioration in diplomatic ties between the two neighbors.The TTP, which ended a ceasefire with the Pakistani government in November 2022, has intensified its attacks on Pakistani security forces.

The sanctions had frozen any US property owned by the targeted entities and barred US nationals from doing business with them.“Pakistan does not harbour any intention in which its nuclear system is aggressive, it is 100% in Pakistan’s defence. It is just intended for deterrence purposes and nothing else,” Sharif told cabinet members during a meeting.Noting that his foreign affairs ministry had given a “comprehensive response” to Washington on the matter, Sharif said, “This programme is not mine, nor any political party’s; it belongs to the 240 million people of this country, and it is dear to them. There will be no compromise on this programme, and the entire nation is united on this issue.”According to a US state department factsheet, the Islamabad-based NDC had sought to obtain components for Pakistan’s long-range ballistic-missile programme and missile-testing equipment. It stated the NDC “is responsible for the development of Pakistan’s ballistic missiles,” including the Shaheen family of missiles.The US sanctions were preceded by high-level military engagements between China and Pakistan. Last month, a top Chinese military official, General Zhang Youxia, visited Pakistan along with a high-ranking delegation. Youxia, who is vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC), the overall command of the Chinese military headed by President Xi Jinping, had held one-on-one talks with Pakistan army chief Gen Asim Munir during his visit. Engagements between the two sides, according to the official handout, had focused on “matters of mutual interest, regional security dynamics, measures for regional stability, and enhancing bilateral defence cooperation”.","Washington had announced on Dec 12 that it was imposing more restrictions on Pakistan’s long-range ballistic-missile system.

Their confessions came after an extensive Federal investigation agency (FIA) audit, conducted in 2022, revealed that 457 PIA employees had been recruited on fraudulent credentials.The accused, who initially denied the charges, later approached the court for pre-arrest bail, which was granted. However, during their indictment, they pleaded guilty and requested to record their confessional statements. Judge Tanveer Ahmad Sheikh ensured the accused understood the implications of their confessions, allowing them 30 minutes to reconsider before recording their statements.Nazia Naheed, a former stewardess from Karachi, admitted to using a fake BA degree to gain a promotion. Hired on a contract in 2001, she was terminated in 2014 when her forged credentials were discovered.

He retired in 2018 but was implicated in the FIA probe. Lastly, Kashan Aijaz Dodhy, a cadet pilot since 1995, confessed to submitting a fake BSc degree to show extra qualifications, leading to his termination in 2019.The court sentenced the four to imprisonment until the court’s rising and imposed fines.","Four former Pakistan international airlines (PIA) employees confessed to using fake degrees to secure employment or promotions.

Copying Cirus

MUMBAI: A little-known incident in the history of Pakistan’s nuclear weapons programme is a purported attempt made by the country in the early ’70s to copy the design of India’s Cirus reactor — a 40 MW thermal neutron research facility, which first achieved criticality at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre in Trombay, near Mumbai, on July 10, 1960. An acronym for Canada India Reactor Utility Services, Cirus was constructed with Canadian assistance at a shared cost of $14.14 million, according to news reports.Pakistan’s attempt to copy the design of the reactor was revealed by none other than Feroz H. Khan , a man who played a role in the neighbouring country’s nuclear weapons programme. In his book “Eating Grass: The Making Of The Pakistani Bomb”, published in 2012 by the Stanford University Press, Feroz wrote, “Munir Ahmed Khan, later chairman of the PAEC [Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission], recalled that in October 1965 he had met Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto [the then Pakistan foreign minister] in Vienna. Munir explained to him that he had been to India’s Cirus facility at Trombay in 1964 and saw for himself that India was well on its way to making the [nuclear] bomb. Bhutto asked Munir to meet Ayub Khan in December during Ayub’s upcoming visits to the United Kingdom and the United States and try to convince the president of the urgency of a weapons programme.” The country eventually carried out its first nuclear weapons tests on May 28 and 30, 1998.Feroz’s disclosure, though now 12 years old, assumes immediate significance in the context of the US last week announcing fresh sanctions on Pakistan’smissile development programme. For the first time, the measures target Pakistan’s state-run National Development Complex, for its role in the country’s mission development programme. US deputy NSA Jon Finer has said, “Pakistan has developed increasingly sophisticated missile technology… If these trends continue, Pakistan will have the capability to strike targets well beyond South Asia, including in the United States.”Feroz’s writing about the Cirus reactor is important because the plutonium for India’s Smiling Buddha project — the country’s first nuclear weapons test at Pokhran on May 18, 1974 — was from this reactor.According to Feroz, “Pakistani leadership wanted the rights to copy technological designs for its indigenous programme without incurring penalties and while remaining on the ‘good side’ of the international system.” He recalled: “While work to commission KANUPP [Karachi Nuclear Power Complex] went on, Munir Ahmed Khan said that there would be a secret team headed by a nuclear official, Sardar Ali Khan, to work on replicating India’s Cirus reactor.The author quotes Pervez Butt, who was purportedly part of the secret “copying’’ team and was chairman of PAEC between 2001 and 2005, as telling him, “Our team worked tirelessly, I did the mechanical part. When we merged our work and presented, Munir Khan could not believe it.”Feroz, however, has questioned Pakistan’s decision to copy the design of the Cirus reactor because there were some fundamental differences between Cirus and Kanupp.The team had modified the basic Cirus design.","Pakistan's attempt to copy the design of the reactor was revealed by none other than Feroz H. Khan. Cirus was constructed with Canadian assistance at a shared cost of $14.14 million. Pakistan eventually carried out its first nuclear weapons tests on May 28 and 30, 1998.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116608587,imgsize-760319,width-400,resizemode-4/116608587.jpg"

It further stated that both of these demands ""are legitimate"".""If the government fails to take any action on them by Sunday, the first phase of the civil disobedience movement - 'remittance boycott' - will be launched,"" it said.PTI spokesperson Sheikh Waqas Akram also reiterated that the civil disobedience drive would be launched tomorrow (Monday) if the party's demands go unmet.However, the issue of civil disobedience has been apparently put on hold for some time while allowing the two sides to address the differences through political means.Khan, 72, on December 5 had warned of a civil disobedience movement from December 14 if his demands about the release of political prisoners facing trial and the formation of a judicial commission to probe the events of May 9, 2023, and November 26 this year were unmet.Meanwhile, Pakistan's military courts sentenced 25 civilians to prison terms ranging from two to 10 years for attacking military installations during riots which erupted following the arrest of Khan in May last year, the Army announced on Saturday.On May 9, 2023, Khan's PTI supporters allegedly attacked several military installations, including the army headquarters in Rawalpindi and the ISI building in Faisalabad, to vent their anger against the arrest of their party founder in a corruption case.Hundreds of suspects were arrested in the countrywide swoop and at least 103 were handed over to the military authorities for trial due to their involvement in attacks on military installations.Khan's party has launched multiple protests through 2023 and 2024 demanding the release of their supreme leader, the latest being in November 2024.The former prime minister, currently lodged at the Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail, was arrested in August last year and faces multiple cases since his government was toppled in April 2022.","The committee includes deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, the prime minister's political aide Rana Sanaullah, education minister Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, minister for privatisation Aleem Khan. National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq had taken the lead by offering on Wednesday that he was ready to host the two sides.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116570246,imgsize-1097818,width-400,resizemode-4/116570246.jpg"
"1,566 terror attacks killed 924 in Pakistan over past 10 months",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/1566-terror-attacks-killed-924-in-pakistan-over-past-10-months/articleshow/116551393.cms,"KARACHI: Ten years have passed since Ajoon Khan's son died in a ghastly attack by the Pakistani Taliban that killed about 150 people, mostly children, at a military-run school in Peshawar, in northwestern Pakistan. But the pain of loss is unrelenting - it grows only deeper with time. Khan, a lawyer, said he could never forget the parents sobbing and pleading outside the school gates.The brutal assault on the school in Peshawar led to rare political unity in support of a comprehensive counterterrorism strategy for Pakistan and a vast military operation in the country's former tribal areas near Afghanistan. The efforts forced militants to retreat across the border and brought a degree of relative peace to Pakistan. Large-scale terrorist attacks were significantly reduced, with fatalities dropping from 2,451 across 1,717 attacks in 2013 to 220 in 146 attacks in 2020. But the hard-won gains are now in jeopardy.Over the past few years, violence by the Pakistani Taliban and other Islamic militant groups has surged in parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, in northwestern Pakistan. Experts attribute the increase to the Afghan Taliban's seizure of power in neighbouring Afghanistan in Aug 2021.Last week, the interior ministry reported that 924 people, including civilians and law enforcement personnel, had been killed in 1,566 terrorist attacks across the country over the past 10 months. It said 341 terrorists had been killed during the period.Early on Saturday, sixteen soldiers were killed in northwest Pakistan in an attack by Islamist militants, a senior police official in the South Waziristan region said. Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), also known as the Pakistan Taliban, claimed responsibility for the attack, giving a higher figure for the number of personnel killed, Reuters reported.Experts and security officials have identified a range of challenges impeding Pakistan's progress against terrorism: political instability, weak governance, dwindling public support, economic constraints and reduced US counterterrorism assistance after the end of the 20-year war in Afghanistan.""The greatest challenge lies in mobilising the necessary financial resources and manpower for operations across such vast regions,"" said Muhammad Amir Rana, director of the Pak Institute for Peace Studies, a security think tank in Islamabad. The source of the problem for Pakistan, experts say, is found across the border, in Afghanistan.The Taliban administration in Kabul, the Afghan capital, denies accusations of harbouring militants from TTP. But Asfandyar Mir, a senior expert at the United States Institute of Peace, said the TTP had been given ""a permissive safe haven in Afghanistan,"" which had allowed it to become ""resilient and lethal.""Pakistani security officials privately acknowledged that they had misjudged how the new Taliban rulers of Afghanistan would handle TTP. The officials had anticipated that the Taliban leaders would help curb the TTP in return for the covert support that Pakistan had provided them during the US-led war. Instead, the Taliban in Kabul have provided the TTP with resources and advanced American-made weapons and equipment seized after the collapse of the US-supported Afghan govt, according to a senior security official in Islamabad who spoke on the condition of anonymity.The TTP has gone on to unleash a wave of attacks inside Pakistan as it wages a campaign whose aim is to overthrow the govt. Among them was a suicide bombing in January 2023 that killed over 100 people at a mosque in Peshawar.Pakistani security forces have also been locked in a conflict with ethnic separatist groups in Balochistan, an arid province bordering Afghanistan and Iran that is home to the Chinese-run port Gwadar. nyt","Violence by the Pakistani Taliban and other Islamic militant groups has surged in parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, in northwestern Pakistan.

Pakistan military jails 25 Imran Khan supporters over May 9 violence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-military-jails-25-imran-khan-supporters-over-may-9-violence/articleshow/116546778.cms,"TOI correspondent from Islamabad:

Pakistan’s military announced Saturday that 25 civilians have been sentenced to prison terms ranging from two to 10 years for their alleged involvement in violent protests following the arrest of former PM Imran Khan on May 9 last year, which resulted in the death of at least eight people.Khan’s supporters stormed govt buildings and military installations. The military’s statement detailed that the convictions relate primarily to attacks on key military sites, including Jinnah House (the Lahore corps commander’s residence), General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi, and a Pakistan Air Force (PAF) base in Mianwali.The sentences were issued by Field General Court Martial as part of the first phase of trials. Supreme Court had earlier conditionally allowed military courts to pronounce verdicts for 85 civilians detained in connection with the riots.The military statement highlighted that the convicts have the right to appeal and other legal recourses as guaranteed by law.The May 9 violence led to the arrest of many politicians and supporters of Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) party. PTI has denied involvement in the violence. However, govt and military maintain that the attacks were meticulously planned and executed by PTI brass.Khan and his party have called for a judicial probe into the May 9 events, claiming the violence was a “false flag” operation intended to suppress PTI.PTI condemned the military court’s decision. National Assembly leader of opposition Omar Ayub wrote on X: “Military court sentences against civilians rejected. The detainees are civilians and cannot be tried by military courts.” He labelled the process as “kangaroo courts”.PTI’s US chapter criticised the rulings. “Colonels and majors, acting as judges, have sentenced civilians it tried in military courts. These civilians were held for over a year in harsh conditions, with many tortured into giving false confessions,” it posted on X.Amnesty International also denounced the military court’s decision, describing it as “an intimidation tactic, designed to crack down on dissent”.Army’s media wing Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) referred to the protests as “politically provoked violence and arson”. ISPR said further sentences for the remaining accused will be announced once the legal process is completed.",25 civilians have been sentenced to prison terms ranging from two to 10 years.

History of displacement

Authorities respond

At least 17 houses belonging to the Christian Tripura community were allegedly set ablaze on Christmas Eve night at Sarai Union in Lama upazila, Bandarban, reported the Daily Star.The arson attack left the residents, who were away in a nearby village for prayers and Christmas celebrations, homeless and devastated.According to victims, the miscreants targeted the new Tongjhiri Tripura Para, where the community had rebuilt their homes after being displaced several years ago.Locals reported that 17 out of 19 houses in the village were completely gutted, leaving little to salvage.Tongjhiri has long been home to the Tripura community, but residents alleged they were forcibly evicted several years ago and claimed that the land on which they were living, had been leased to the wife of a high-ranking police officer during the Awami League regime.Paisapru Tripura, the head of the community, told the outlet, ""We have been living here for three or four generations. A group of people, identifying themselves as 'SP's men,' evicted us four to five years ago.""The community returned and rebuilt their homes following the fall of the Awami League government.Gungamani Tripura, one of the victims, shared his anguish, ""Our houses have been completely burned to ashes. We could not save anything. Today is supposed to be our happiest day, but this has turned into a nightmare. We demand exemplary punishment for the criminals.""Md Idris, chairman of Sarai Union Parishad, confirmed about the incident, adding that 17 houses were destroyed. Acting Lama Upazila Nirbahi Officer (UNO), Ruppayan Deb, visited the site and provided initial relief, including a blanket and a sack of rice for each affected family.""I have asked the families to file a written complaint,"" Ruppayan Deb said. ""We will coordinate with the deputy commissioner and the upazila project implementation officer for further action"", Deb added.Md Enamul Haque Bhuiyan, inspector (investigation) of Lama Police Station, noted that land disputes in the remote area have been ongoing, with complaints and counter-complaints of land grabbing reported since August 5. He assured that law enforcement is working diligently to identify the perpetrators and conduct a fair investigation.","At least 17 houses belonging to the Christian Tripura community were allegedly set ablaze on Christmas Eve night at Sarai Union in Lama upazila, Bandarban.

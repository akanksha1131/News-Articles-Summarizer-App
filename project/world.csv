Watch: Donald Trump flaunts $5 million 'Gold Card' — what it looks like,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/watch-donald-trump-flaunts-5-million-gold-card-what-it-looks-like/articleshow/119961658.cms,"What is Gold Card program?



US president Donald Trump on Friday showed off the new Gold Card worth $ 5 million and said that it would be available ""in about less than 2 weeks"".When asked by the reporter who was the first buyer, Trump said, ""I am the first buyer"".""For $5 million this could be yours... it will be out in about less than 2 weeks probably. Pretty exciting, right?"" he said as he showed the Gold Card with his face on it.Trump introduced this new plan to offer Gold Cards to affluent foreign nationals in February this year, providing them with US residency and a route to citizenship. He projected that the initiative could generate trillions in revenue and contribute to lowering the national debt.“It’s somewhat like a green card, but at a higher level of sophistication. It’s a road to citizenship for people, and essentially people of wealth or people of great talent,” he had said.With a price tag of $5 million, the Gold Card program is set to replace the EB-5 immigrant investor visa . Established in 1990, the EB-5 program allowed immigrants to obtain green cards by investing a minimum of $1 million in a business—or $800,000 in a low-income area—that created at least 10 jobs. In 2024, over 4,500 EB-5 visas were granted.In return, holders receive residency benefits similar to those of Green Card holders, granting them the right to live and work in the United States. While the program offers a pathway to citizenship, the specific timeline and procedural details have not yet been fully disclosed.The initiative is designed to replace the EB-5 program, which has faced criticism for inefficiency and fraud. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick described the previous system as being ""full of nonsense, make-believe, and fraud."" By raising the investment threshold and streamlining the application process, the administration aims to attract high-net-worth individuals while reducing the potential for abuse.","US president Donald Trump on Friday showed off the new Gold Card worth $ 5 million.

Hamas ready to release all hostages if Israel withdraws from Gaza: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/hamas-ready-to-release-all-hostages-if-israel-withdraws-from-gaza-report/articleshow/119961140.cms,"Hamas is willing to release the remaining 59 hostages held in Gaza on the condition that Israel agrees to a permanent ceasefire, according to Palestinian officials speaking to the Times of Israel.The announcement comes amid Israel’s intensification of its military operations across the Strip. A senior Palestinian official told the outlet that the group, through its mediators, conveyed its readiness to free all captives, provided that Israeli forces withdraw from Gaza completely.However, It still remains unclear whether the proposal will gain any acceptance as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has consistently ruled out any agreement that does not include Hamas’ total defeat, including disarmament and its full removal from Gaza.While Hamas continues insisting both sides to adhere to the original US-brokered ceasefire framework from January, the group appears to have tempered its stance, now recognising that a permanent truce may not be immediately possible..“We had no other choice. The situation in Gaza is terrible,” one official said, highlighting the dire humanitarian toll.Palestinian representatives added that Hamas may also be open to phased releases in exchange for short-term truces. In a recent proposal presented by US special envoy Steve Witkoff, Hamas agreed to release five hostages in return for a temporary ceasefire. The deal was rejected by Israel which demanded the release of 11 living captives and the return of the bodies of 16 deceased individuals, New York Post reported.Hamas negotiators have not responded to the Israeli counter-proposal and deemed the demands unacceptable. The group insists that any path to a full hostage release must involve Israel eventually agreeing to talks around a permanent ceasefire. They maintain that disarmament is off the table as long as Palestinian statehood remains unrecognised.For now, peace talks are “at a standstill,” Palestinian officials confirmed.Meanwhile, the Israel defense forces are executing a plan to isolate the city of Rafah in southern Gaza, further segmenting the territory into three areas. The IDF already controls the northern border and seeks to occupy roughly 25 per cent of the Gaza Strip in its latest push.The humanitarian crisis continues to escalate with more than 50,000 people having died in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run Ministry of Health. Aid and food supplies remain heavily restricted under the ongoing blockade.Inside Israel, Netanyahu is also under growing domestic pressure. Families of the remaining hostages, believed to include just 24 living individuals such as Israeli-American Edan Alexander, are staging protests, accusing the government of prioritising political objectives over the safe return of their loved ones.",Hamas is willing to release the remaining 59 hostages held in Gaza on the condition that Israel agrees to a permanent ceasefire.

Is Elon Musk stepping down from DOGE?



Right-wing political commentator Megyn Kelly reacted to the news reports that President Donald Trump confirmed to his close aides that Elon Musk would be stepping down from his government role. Though both Elon Musk and White House rubbished the reports and asserted that it was obvious to happen as Elon has been working on a time-bound project, Megyn Kelly said the US is lucky to have someone like Elon, willing to touch the government with a 10-ft pole.""It's not like Taylor Swift. She got booed at the Superbowl because she got political, and she alienated half her fan base and half of the country and when I see her today, do I feel bd for her? Not at all. You put yourself out there. You did not need to get political. But in her case, it was utterly pointless. You have no political swing, you just wanted to feel like you are more important..."" Meghyn said, explaining that Elon's involvement in politics was not pointless.It has been very hard for Elon Musk as nobody now wants to buy a Tesla the way Tesla vehicles are coming under attack, Kelly said adding that though Elon Musk is protected by the Department of Justice, people like former VP candidate Tim Walz are celebrating the attack on Tesla; people are doing hate crimes against Tesla.Kelly said it was important for the nation that Elon Musk turned political unlike Taylor Swift. ""Elon actually did help Trump get elected. He did move the needle and there is no question about that.""In a Fox interview, Elon Musk recently said that most of his work is done and he would be wrapping up DOGE work soon. Donald Trump reportedly told his inner circle that he's very happy with what Elon Musk did in terms of cutting down on government expenditure but as Elon has so many businesses to handle, he would go back to his own work.

'Operation is over, patient will be far stronger'



Vice President JD Vance who was present at the Rose Garden when Donald Trump unveiled his tariff that shook up the global order called it an example of nationalism. In an exclusive interview with Breitbart, Vance said for the first time in 40 years, the US has a president who is reversing the trend of the US serving as a piggy bank for the rest of the world.If tariffs are so terrible, then why countries have been raising their tariffs against the US, Vance asked adding that the reciprocal tariff makes absolute sense and countries are now nervous. ""In a word, it’s nationalism,” Vance said.""In our foreign policy and our economic policy, we have a president who’s going to put the interests of Americans first and that means in our economic policy, we’re going to fight back against ridiculous trade practices. In our foreign policy, we’re going to stop starting stupid wars. But we’re also going to ensure that America’s enemies respect America’s national interests and that means we need access to critical resources. That means that we need our allies and ourselves to have missile security, to have national security, to make our own weapons if God forbid a war would start,"" Vance said.""Economic security is connected to national security because, if God forbid, we had to go to war, we want our troops to go to war with the best equipment and equipment that’s made in the United States of America. The president mentioned this in his remarks today: that we’re in a situation where if we went to war against a country that made our pharmaceuticals, our kids wouldn’t have access to antibiotics. So this basic understanding of President Trump’s, which I think is very much common sense and I think most Americans get, is that we need to have more self-sufficiency,"" Vance said.Donald Trump Thursday posted on Truth Social, ""the operation is over"".

Rise and fall of Kailasa: How Nithyananda's fictional country 'land trafficked' Bolivia's indigenous people,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/rise-and-fall-of-kailasa-how-nithyanandas-fictional-country-land-trafficked-bolivias-indigenous-people/articleshow/119947051.cms,"PTI file photo

No diplomatic relations with the alleged nation: Bolivia

1,000-year lease agreement with indigenous groups for Amazon land

A self-proclaimed 'sovereign nation' called the United States of Kailasa , complete with passports, a 'cosmic constitution' and official currency, had gained attention through its representatives' appearances at UN events and meetings with global leaders.Their leader Nityananda, a fugitive spiritual figure, claims supernatural abilities, including control over reincarnation processes for wealthy clients. However, recent events in Bolivia have exposed the group's questionable activities, with authorities arresting 20 Kailasa associates for 'land trafficking' indigenous communities. The New York Times reported that the arrested followers of Nityananda were subsequently deported to their actual countries of citizenship.The Bolivian foreign affairs ministry officially declared their non-recognition of Kailasa. “Bolivia does not maintain diplomatic relations with the alleged nation ‘United States of Kailasa ,’” the statement said.The movement's origins trace to 2019 when Swami Nithyananda , who styles himself as 'His Divine Holiness, the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism,' escaped India whilst facing serious criminal allegations. Originally named Arunachalam Rajasekaran, he established his first ashram near Bengaluru, expanding globally. He made extraordinary claims, including abilities to heal blindness and alter sunrise timing.After fleeing India amidst rape and sexual assault charges, he emerged claiming leadership of Kailasa, purportedly located in the Andean region.Kailasa's activities have caused diplomatic embarrassments worldwide. In 2023, a Paraguayan official resigned after signing an agreement with them, whilst Newark's mayor cancelled a sister cities arrangement. In Bolivia, their representatives secured photographs with President Luis Arce before their recent arrest.Investigation by Bolivian newspaper El Deber revealed attempts by Nityananda's followers to secure extensive land leases from indigenous groups, including the Baure community. Pedro Guasico, a Baure leader, described how initial offers of post-forest fire assistance evolved into a problematic 1,000-year lease agreement.Guasico, explained that their initial contact with Kailasa officials occurred in late last year following forest fires, when assistance was offered. Subsequently, discussions led to a proposed land lease spanning an area triple the size of New Delhi, with a planned 25-year agreement promising annual payments of nearly $200,000.However, when Kailasa representatives presented an English version of the contract, it had been modified to extend over 1,000 years and included rights to airspace and natural resource extraction.Despite these alterations, Guasico acknowledged that his group proceeded with signing. ""We made the mistake of listening to them,"" he said. ""They offered us that money as an annual bonus for conserving and protecting our territory, but it was completely false.""","The United States of Kailasa is a self-proclaimed'sovereign nation' with a 'cosmic constitution' and official currency.

Extremism In Canada: Canada Election 2025: Why Conservative candidate Don Patel was dropped for heart-hugging emoji,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/canada-election-2025-why-conservative-candidate-don-patel-was-dropped-for-heart-hugging-emoji/articleshow/119947319.cms,"Khalistan is not just a movement



Nijjar and Pakistan: The missing context



A symptom of a larger problem



Trudeau’s India problem



""Clandestine info-gathering techniques, coercive tactics targeting Canadians"": Trudeau accuses India amid diplomatic row

The fire is still burning



Don Patel , the Conservative Party ’s candidate for Etobicoke North, was removed from the 2025 federal election campaign after endorsing a controversial social media post that called for the deportation of certain individuals to India.The post — vague in its language but widely interpreted as referring to Khalistani supporters — read: “Should be stop these people by Canadian government and deported to India then PM Modi can take care of these non-sense people.” Patel responded with a heart-hugging emoji, a gesture interpreted as support.While the Conservative Party acted swiftly to drop Patel, calling his engagement with the post “clearly unacceptable,” the incident taps into a far more complex and volatile political reality — one that has shaped Canada’s domestic discourse and foreign policy for decades: the shadow of the Khalistan movement and its ties to terrorism, extremism, and diplomatic fallout.The Khalistan movement — which advocates for an independent Sikh state carved out of India’s Punjab — is often painted in Canada as a freedom struggle or diasporic identity cause. But in India, and among large sections of the South Asian community in Canada, it carries far darker connotations.In 1985, Khalistani extremists were responsible for the bombing of Air India Flight 182 , also known as Air Kanishka, which exploded off the coast of Ireland, killing 329 people, including 268 Canadians. It remains the deadliest act of aviation terrorism before 9/11 — and the worst mass killing in Canadian history. Despite overwhelming evidence and a lengthy investigation, only one person was convicted. The rest either walked free or were never tried. For many, the lack of justice remains an open wound, especially within the Indo-Canadian community.To this day, the attack is a chilling reminder that Khalistan is not just an idea — it has been weaponized, quite literally, to devastating effect.The issue gained new life in 2023, when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accused Indian government agents of assassinating Hardeep Singh Nijjar , a Canadian citizen and a prominent Khalistan activist, outside a Sikh temple in British Columbia. The charge triggered a diplomatic firestorm. India vehemently denied the allegations and pointed to Nijjar’s history of extremism — a history often sanitized in Canadian public discourse.Indian intelligence reports claim that Nijjar was not merely an activist but was receiving arms training in Pakistan, under the protection of groups hostile to both India and the West. He was reportedly linked to efforts to revive Sikh militancy and recruit for separatist causes from Canadian soil. A Canada commission report later concluded that there was no 'definitive link' between any foreign hand and Nijjar's assassination.While Canada’s position has focused on the principle of sovereignty and the rule of law, India has maintained that its core concern is the growing use of Canadian territory as a safe haven for extremist networks — a concern echoed by many Indian-origin Canadians who feel their voices are drowned out by politically mobilized fringe groups.Patel’s post reflects a simmering frustration in some corners of the diaspora. The belief that Canada has turned a blind eye to extremism — in part due to political expediency — is not isolated to Delhi. Many Indo-Canadians, particularly Hindus and moderate Sikhs, have grown increasingly uneasy with the Canadian politicians' perceived softness on Khalistani extremism. Ironically, Patel’s removal was likely a bid to prevent his statement from playing into Liberal attacks, but the damage is done. It reinforces the perception that Canada's political parties are deeply entangled in diaspora vote-bank politics — where foreign conflicts are imported and amplified for domestic gain.All of this unfolds against the backdrop of former PM Justin Trudeau’s own spectacular fall from grace — a decline in which India played a central role. His 2018 India visit, remembered more for Bollywood costumes than diplomacy, first exposed the Trudeau government’s naivety on South Asian geopolitics. His 2023 Nijjar allegation turned naivety into outright rupture.Trudeau’s attempt to walk the tightrope — appeasing domestic Khalistani activists while maintaining bilateral ties — collapsed under the weight of realpolitik. India retaliated by cutting visas, expelling diplomats, and cancelling trade talks. Even traditional allies like the U.S. and Australia were tepid in their support, unwilling to sacrifice relations with India for Trudeau’s crusade.Don Patel’s removal is not the end of this story — it’s merely another flare-up in a fire that has been smouldering for decades. As Canada heads into the 2025 election, the nation must confront uncomfortable truths: that diaspora politics have consequences, that extremism can hide in plain sight, and that failing to reckon with history — from Air India to Nijjar — invites its repetition.In this volatile mix, politicians like Don Patel may come and go, but the deeper reckoning still lies ahead.",Don Patel was removed from the 2025 federal election campaign after endorsing a controversial social media post that called for the deportation of certain individuals to India.

I also like him, personally,” Trump said during a conversation with Fox News aboard Air Force One.Trump's remarks were in response to Musk’s future as a “special government employee” linked to the DOGE project.“We're in no rush. But there will be a point at which time Elon's going to have to leave,"" Trump said.The President's comments came amid reports that Musk may soon exit his temporary government role, purportedly because members of Trump’s inner circle had discussed concerns over Tesla chief's “unpredictability” and potential as a “political liability.”Despite the speculation, Trump made it clear he remains a staunch supporter of Musk. “Elon is fantastic. He's a patriot,” he told reporters. “He can stay at the White House as long as he'd like,” adding again that he wants him to stay “as long as possible.”Trump also hinted that the work being done was of major significance. “The secretaries” in the Cabinet will take over Musk’s responsibilities after his departure, Trump said, noting that today, that work uncovered something “horrible” and “incredible,” though he declined to elaborate.Vice President JD Vance also backed Musk amid reports of his stepping down, saying: “The fake news always tries to take the strongest members of the President’s team and attack them and tear them down.""The DOGE office was established by an executive order Trump signed on January 20.

The Trump card: $5 million worth 'gold card' for the super rich unveiled,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/the-trump-card-5-million-worth-gold-card-for-the-super-rich-unveiled/articleshow/119962160.cms,"US President Donald Trump introduced a controversial new “gold card” scheme, offering wealthy foreigners a fast-track to permanent residency in America for $5 million.Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Thursday, Trump proudly displayed the design of what he called the “Trump card,” part of his administration’s overhaul of the EB-5 visa programme .“For $5 million, this could be yours,” Trump said, holding up the card. “That was the first of the cards. You know what that card is?”“It’s the gold card — the Trump card .”The metallic gold card featured a glossy, light-reflecting finish, bearing images of Trump and the Statue of Liberty, with 'The Trump Card' in bold and United States of America at the top.Trump’s announcement came as he travelled to Florida for a LIV Golf tournament at his resort. While he claimed to be the first buyer of the gold card, he admitted he was unsure who had purchased the second.This gold green card scheme modernises the EB-5 visa system, which was created back in the 1990s, granting green cards to foreign nationals who invest at least $1 million in the US.Unlike regular visas that tie migrants to specific jobs, a green card provides permanent residency and a pathway to citizenship.Commerce secretary Howard Lutnick previously claimed that more than 1,000 gold cards had already been sold and estimated that 37 million people worldwide could afford one. He argued that the programme could raise significant funds to tackle America’s national debt, which currently stands at $36.5 trillion.“There’s a line for EB-5 of 250,000 right now. 200,000 of these gold green cards [at $5 million] is $1 trillion to pay down our debt,” Lutnick explained.The revised system also simplified the process, eliminating previous preferences for investments in rural or high-unemployment areas.However, government watchdog groups have raised concerns that the scheme could lead to corruption, warning that similar ""golden visa"" programmes in other countries have been exploited for money laundering and political favouritism.Since the past two and a half decades, 135,518 EB-5 visas have been issued, according to data from the Invest In the USA (IIUSA) trade association of program participants, quoted by the New York Post.Critics have, however, raised concerns about the scheme, warning that such a system could lead to corruption.The new programme is expected to launch in the coming weeks.","US President Donald Trump introduced a controversial new ‘gold card’ scheme, offering wealthy foreigners a fast-track to permanent residency in America for $5 million.

"UK court orders Donald Trump to pay $821,000 legal bill over 'Steele dossier' lawsuit",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/uk-court-orders-donald-trump-to-pay-821000-legal-bill-over-steele-dossier-lawsuit/articleshow/119961809.cms,"US President Donald Trump

A British judge has ordered US President Donald Trump to pay more than 625,000 pounds (approximately $820,000) in legal fees to a consulting firm he sued unsuccessfully over a controversial intelligence dossier.The payment stems from a case Trump brought in 2022 against Orbis Business Intelligence , the firm established by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele.Steele had been commissioned by Democratic Party operatives in 2016 to compile a dossier containing damaging claims about Trump, some of which sparked major political debates ahead of his first presidential inauguration.That dossier alleged Trump had been “compromised” by Russia’s security services, including through salacious claims that he had participated in “sex parties” in St. Petersburg and engaged with sex workers in Moscow. Trump has consistently denied these accusations, calling them completely false.In a written statement submitted to the court, Trump said the allegations were “wholly untrue.” He emphasized he had never engaged in “perverted sexual behavior including the hiring of prostitutes ... in the presidential suite of a hotel in Moscow,” nor had he taken part in “sex parties” in St. Petersburg, bribed Russian officials, or given them “sufficient material to blackmail me.”The legal battle came to a close in February 2024, when Judge Karen Steyn dismissed Trump’s claim. She ruled that the lawsuit had no real prospect of success, partly because of the significant delay in bringing the case. Steyn’s ruling did not address the veracity of the allegations themselves but concluded that the case was “bound to fail.”Trump had argued that Orbis breached U.K. data protection laws and that the contents of the Steele dossier were fictitious. His legal team described the allegations as “shocking and scandalous claims” that had caused significant harm to his reputation.Following the dismissal of the lawsuit, Trump was initially required to pay an instalment of 290,000 pounds toward Orbis’s legal expenses. After failing to make that payment, a separate hearing was held to determine the full costs.On Thursday, Judge Jason Rowley concluded that Trump must pay 626,058.98 pounds, with interest on the amount accruing daily at a rate of 12%. Trump's legal team had earlier criticized the legal fee demand, claiming it had been set “absolutely outrageously high.”","US President Donald Trump must pay more than 625,000 pounds (approximately $820,000) in legal fees to a consulting firm.

No power to do any of this: 19 states in US sue Trump's election order,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/no-power-to-do-any-of-this-19-states-in-us-sue-trumps-election-order/articleshow/119961573.cms,"US President Donald Trump’s latest executive order on elections faces legal challenge by Democratic attorneys general from 19 states, arguing it is an unconstitutional attempt to override states’ authority. The lawsuit, filed on Thursday in a US district court in Massachusetts, aimed to block key provisions of the order, which imposes stricter voting requirements nationwide.The executive order, issued just a week ago, demanded individuals to provide documentary proof of citizenship while registering to vote and required all mail-in ballots to be received by the election day. These measures, the lawsuit contended, breach upon states’ constitutional right to regulate their own elections.The suit said that the Constitution allows states to set their own election rules, letting them decide the “times, places and manner” of how elections are run.“The President has no power to do any of this,” the attorneys general stated in their court filing. “The Elections EO is unconstitutional, antidemocratic, and un-American,” news agency AP quoted.Trump’s order claimed that the country has failed to enforce what he called ""basic and necessary election protection."" However, election officials across the country have repeatedly argued that recent elections have been among the most secure in US history, with no evidence of widespread fraud.The order is the latest move in Trump’s long-standing campaign against US election processes. In 2020, after losing to Democrat Joe Biden, Trump claimed the election was ""rigged"" and accused voting machines of manipulation.Trump argued that his executive order will help prevent illegal voting by noncitizens, despite multiple studies showing that such cases are exceedingly rare. The order has received backing from Republican election officials in several states, who claim it could help combat voter fraud and allow better access to federal data for maintaining voter rolls.However, critics warned that the order could lead to widespread voter disenfranchisement as many states currently count mail-in ballots postmarked by election day, and others allow voters to correct minor ballot errors.The order threatened to cut federal funding for states that refuse to comply, which Democratic officials argue is an overreach of presidential power.“We are a democracy – not a monarchy – and this executive order is an authoritarian power grab,” said New York attorney general Letitia James.Rhode Island attorney general Peter Neronha also accused Trump of attempting to sidestep Congress and strong-arm states into compliance.“In one fell swoop, this president is attempting to undermine elections and sidestep the Congress, and we’re not going to stand for it,” he said.Officials in Nevada, a key swing state, also pushed back, calling their elections “fair, secure, and transparent.” California attorney general Rob Bonta denounced the order as a sweeping attempt to impose voting restrictions and suppress voter turnout.Other lawsuits filed against the order argued that millions of eligible voters may be unable to meet the new documentation requirements. While citizens are already required to attest to their status under penalty of perjury, Trump’s order limited acceptable proof to a US passport, a Real ID-compliant driver’s license that explicitly states citizenship, or a valid photo ID accompanied by additional proof of citizenship.Democrats argued that these restrictions would disproportionately impact Americans without easy access to birth certificates, as well as women who have changed their names after marriage. A similar requirement in New Hampshire recently caused issues for some women voting in local elections.","Democratic attorneys general from 19 states filed a lawsuit against President Donald Trump's latest executive order on elections.

"India gets slapped with tariff, others punched",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/india-gets-slapped-with-tariff-others-punched/articleshow/119961191.cms,"India's reaction:

At a White House Rose Garden event on Wednesday on what he called “Liberation Day” for the US, India became a middling victim in Trump’s take-no-prisoner approach that treated friend and foe alike with a two-tier tariff: a baseline tax of 10% on all countries that will go into effect on April 5, and additional tariffs on some countries that he considers to be the “worst offenders”, which will be imposed on April 9.India, described by Trump as the ‘tariff king’, makes the US President’s ‘worst offender’ checklist because, by his calculation, New Delhi taxes US imports to the tune of 52%, a dubious figure arrived at by adding perceived non-monetary, nontariff barriers, ‘currency manipulation’ etc. China was assessed at 67%, Taiwan at 64%, and South Korea at 50%.But out of the ‘kindness of his heart’ he would impose not a ‘commonsense reciprocal tariff’ but give a 50% ‘discount,’ Trump said, thus making it 27% tariff on imports from India.“For decades, our country has been looted, pillaged, raped and plundered by nations near and far – both friend and foe alike. Foreign cheaters have ransacked our factories, and foreign scavengers have torn apart our once beautiful American dream,” the president of the richest country on earth raged in remarks that were borderline offensive and distasteful.Financial markets plunged in response. Some $2tn of market value was wiped out in S&P 500 stocks alone as the index fell 4%, its worst day since Sept 2022. The dollar experienced its largest single-day decline on record, dropping 2.1% against major currencies.The ripple effect of Trump’s sweeping tariffs will reshape global trade flows, disrupt supply chains, and test longstanding diplomatic alliances. As countries scramble to respond, the economic and geopolitical fallout is likely to be deep and enduring.The govt said it would seek to “expeditiously” clinch a “mutually beneficial” bilateral trade deal with the US and reiterated its commitment to strong strategic relations.Sources said the commerce department is consulting export councils and ministries to gauge the fallout and explore support for affected businesses.With PM Modi and Trump agreeing to a bilateral trade agreement later this year, India and the US have finalised the broad contours of detailed discussions with technical negotiations expected to be launched this month. This, sources said, gave India a lead over others who will now begin an engagement with the US to seek tariff cuts. “India was an early mover and over the last 50 days a lot of work has been done. The idea is to settle all outstanding bilateral trade issues,” an official said. The assessment is that the Trump administration too is keen to engage and a deal can be crafted by lowering a few duties in India.","India, described by Trump as the ‘tariff king’, makes the US President’s ‘worst offender’ checklist.

The results provide some of the strongest evidence yet that some viral infections can have effects on brain function years later and that preventing them can help stave off cognitive decline.The study, published in the journal Nature, found people who received the vaccine were 20% less likely to develop dementia in the seven years afterward than those who were not vaccinated. ""If you're reducing the risk of dementia by 20%, that's quite important in a public health context, given that we don't really have much else at the moment that slows down the onset of dementia,"" said Paul Harrison, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Oxford. Harrison was not involved in the study but has done other research indicating shingles vaccines lower dementia risk.Whether the protection can last beyond seven years can only be determined with further research. But with few currently effective treatments or preventions, Harrison said, shingles vaccines appear to have ""some of the strongest potential protective effects against dementia...""Shingles cases stem from the virus that causes childhood chickenpox, varicella-zoster, which typically remains dormant in nerve cells for decades. As people age and their immune systems weaken, the virus can reactivate and cause shingles, with symptoms like burning, tingling, painful blisters and numbness. The nerve pain can become chronic and disabling.The study involved an older form of shingles vaccine , Zostavax , which contains a modified version of the live virus. The new vaccine, Shingrix , which contains an inactivated portion of the virus, is more effective and lasting, research shows.","Shingles cases stem from the virus that causes childhood chickenpox.

Trump fires 3 national security officials over concerns they are not loyal: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-fires-3-national-security-officials-over-concerns-they-are-not-loyal-report/articleshow/119960836.cms,"President Trump fired at least three senior national security council officials after an extraordinary meeting in Oval Office with far-right activist Laura Loomer, who laid out a list of people she believed were disloyal to Trump, according to a US official with direct knowledge of the matter.Other members of NSC are expected to be fired as part of the purge, the official added. Some of those officials had been detailed to the council and were sent back to their home agencies over the weekend, even before the meeting held Wednesday. Loomer has been part of a group effort by Trump allies to disparage members of his White House staff. The campaign has included online attacks about the members' families, past employment and aspects of their backgrounds, including professional associations, that have been used to claim they were either disloyal or ideologically unfit to serve in his administration.The agitators have used the phrase ""neocon"" - short for neoconservative - to describe many of those working for NSA Michael Waltz . The insinuation is that the officials are too hawkish, too eager to commit American troops around the world and fundamentally at odds with Trump's ""America First"" foreign policy.Loomer, who has spread conspiracy theories about the Sept 11 attacks, presented her findings directly to Trump. The meeting was attended by Waltz and V-P JD Vance. For now, one of her top targets, the deputy NSA Alex Wong, has been spared, the official said. It is unclear what the firings mean for Waltz, who has a tenuous hold on his own job. Trump has so far declined to terminate Waltz after he inadvertently invited the Atlantic journalist Jeffrey Goldberg onto a Signal group chat in which top officials shared sensitive details about forthcoming strikes against Houthi terrorists.","Other members of NSC are expected to be fired as part of the purge, the official added.

The Pentagon inspector general's office will investigate Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's use of commercial messaging app Signal to discuss air strikes on Yemen, a memo released Thursday said. The review will also look at other defense officials’ use of the publicly available encrypted app, which is not able to handle classified material and is not part of the Defense Department’s secure communications network.“The objective of this evaluation is to determine the extent to which the Secretary of Defense and other DoD personnel complied with DoD policies and procedures for the use of a commercial messaging application for official business,” the acting inspector general, Steven Stebbins, said in a notification letter to Hegseth.A major scandal broke out after journalist Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic claimed that he was mistakenly added to a Signal group by national security adviser Mike Waltz. The group included Hegseth, Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and others, brought together to discuss March 15 military operations against the Iran-backed Houthis.The review was launched at the request of Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed, the committee’s top Democrat.The investigation comes as the Donald Trump administration played down the apparent leak and said no war plan was being discussed in the group.

Howard Lutnick On Trump Tariff: 'Let Trump run the global economy': Howard Lutnick says there's no way Trump would back off on tariffs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/let-trump-run-the-global-economy-howard-lutnick-says-theres-no-way-trump-would-back-off-on-tariffs/articleshow/119954177.cms,"Trump tariff mastermind Howard Lutnick said there's no way the president would back off on reciprocal tariffs.

This is a proven economic formula that works: White House



Donald Trump's commerce secretary Howard Lutnick Thursday said that people should just let the president run the global economy because he knows what he has been doing. He's been talking about it for 35 years, Lutnick said defending the Trump tariffs that led to a market meltdown hours after they were announced. President Trump imposed a base level 10% tariff across the countries extending up to 50%.Lutnick's comment was seen as absurd as the commerce secretary on CNN was also live fact-checked on his other claims that he made.One of the masterminds behind the Trump tariffs, Lutnick confirmed that Trump is not going to back off on his proposed tariffs though there is a week before these tariffs come into force. “The president is not going to back off,"" he said. Countries can fix their tariffs” and non-tariff trade barriers, which he said are “much, much rougher.” “America has got to stop being exploited… and then, and only then, will Donald Trump make a deal with each country,” he said.“Let him fix it. I understand. It’s broken. Let him fix it. Our 36 trillion dollar deficit, right, is going to ruin our children’s lives and our grandchildren’s lives,” Lutnick said. “Let Donald Trump fix the American economy.”White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told NewsNation that the tariff won't impact US workers and companies. “There’s not going to be any pain for American-owned companies and American workers, because their jobs are going to come back home,” Leavitt said.“This is a proven economic formula that works, and the American people should trust in Trump. That’s why they elected him back to the White House,” Leavitt said.Russia, North Korea, Cuba and Belarus have not been included in the list of the countries that would face reciprocal tariffs. White House said it was done because these four nations are already facing extremely high tariffs and US' previously imposed sanctions preclude any meaningful trade with these countries.China faces the highest tariff, 34 per cent, that will be imposed on top of a previously implemented 20 percent tariff for a total 54 percent tariff on goods. Other high numbers include 46 per cent on Vietnam, 32 per cent on Taiwan, 32 per cent on Indonesia and 49 per cent on Cambodia.","Lutnick's comment was seen as absurd as the commerce secretary on CNN was also live fact-checked on his other claims that he made. “America has got to stop being exploited… and then, and only then, will Donald Trump make a deal with each country,” he said.

For Afghans like Zahra, a 32-year-old mother in Rawalpindi, the stakes are personal: “We fled war once. Now they are sending us back to it.”Since the expulsion drive kicked off in late 2023, over 842,000 Afghans have left Pakistan, with more than 40,000 forcibly deported, according to govt figures.Authorities have urged voluntary departures before the deadline, warning of mass deportation starting April 1.

IMF Approves $2 Billion for Pakistan Under Loan Programme | Dawn News English

Pakistan's citizens may have to pay additional taxation as a new carbon levy is anticipated following a USD 1.3 billion agreement with the IMF for climate change initiatives PTI reported citing official sources.Alongside this, the IMF agreed to release approximately USD 1 billion as the second tranche of the previously agreed USD 7 billion loan.""The IMF team has reached a SLA with the Pakistani authorities on the first review of the 37-month extended arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF), and a new 28-month arrangement under the IMF's Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) with total access over the 28 months of around USD 1.3 billion,"" the Fund said in a statement.The total IMF loan now amounts to USD 8.3 billion with this RSF arrangement. Upon approval from the IMF's Executive Board, Pakistan would receive immediate access to approximately USD 2 billion to strengthen its balance of payment position.The new agreement requires additional commitments from the tax-burdened population, including a new carbon levy, increased water rates, and liberalisation of the automobile sector. Dawn newspaper reports that a reduction in power rates is expected, funded by reallocating the existing petroleum levy.Senior officials familiar with the SLA and MEFP indicated that the prime minister would announce an approximate Rs 7 per unit reduction in average electricity rates, effective from April 1, 2025.The implementation of new measures - carbon levy, water pricing and automobile sector reforms - will commence from July 1, 2025. Fiscal consolidation will continue through reduced energy subsidies and controlled development spending.Officials confirmed that whilst the government sought GST reduction on electricity, the IMF instead permitted the use of increased petroleum levy to offset power tariffs. A Rs 10 per litre increase in petroleum levy would provide approximately Rs 1.80 per unit relief.The government has agreed to implement a carbon levy of Rs 3-5 per litre or equivalent on all hydrocarbons, including petroleum products and coal, with gradual increases planned. The revenue will fund climate-related initiatives.Automobile sector trade tariffs will decrease from 10.5% to 6% by FY 2030, ending what both parties agreed was excessive protection. These measures require cabinet approval before implementation through the finance bill 2025-26.The authorities aim to achieve an FY25 underlying primary surplus of 1% of GDP minimum, maintaining consolidation in FY26. The focus remains on revenue mobilisation, spending efficiency and tax base expansion.Pakistan has committed to maintaining strict monetary policy to keep inflation within the SBP's 5-7% target range and preserve foreign exchange market functionality while building reserves.The RSF programme includes strengthening public investment processes, improving water resource management, enhancing disaster financing coordination, addressing climate-related risks, and promoting environmental-friendly transportation to reduce pollution impacts.",IMF Approves $2 Billion for Pakistan Under Loan Programme.

Pakistani YouTube star Rajab Butt has been charged with blasphemy following the launch of his perfume named ""295"", a reference to Pakistan’s controversial blasphemy laws.The case was filed after his video promoting the fragrance sparked outrage, particularly from the hardline Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), which places blasphemy at the core of its political agenda.Butt, who boasts millions of followers online, announced the perfume in a now-deleted video, referencing Section 295 of Pakistan’s penal code, which deals with blasphemy. The move triggered widespread condemnation, with TLP leader Haider Ali Shah Gillani filing a formal complaint against him on Monday.""There are numerous sections in the penal code, but why did he choose blasphemy-related sections to name a perfume?"" Gillani was quoted by the news agency AFP, accusing Butt of attempting to ""normalise"" disrespect towards religious laws.According to AFP, the police charge sheet confirms that Butt has been charged under both blasphemy and cybercrime laws. If convicted, he faces up to 10 years in prison.As the controversy increased, Butt released an apology video on Sunday, holding a Quran as he sought forgiveness. ""I apologise for the words I uttered during the launch of the perfume,"" he said. He also announced the immediate discontinuation of the product.The controversy also relates to the late Indian rapper Sidhu Moose Wala ’s song ""295,"" which also referenced blasphemy laws. Butt had previously likened himself to Moose Wala, claiming they both faced persecution under similar legal provisions, according to Daily Pakistan.This is not Butt’s first legal battle. In January, he pleaded guilty to illegally owning a lion cub, which he had received as a wedding gift.A Pakistani court ordered him to create 12 educational videos on animal welfare as part of his punishment. He avoided jail time by pledging to use his platform to raise awareness about responsible treatment of wild animals.Blasphemy remains an extremely sensitive issue in Pakistan, where accusations, often unverified, can lead to mob violence and even killings.The legal provisions under Section 295 have been widely criticised by human rights groups for being used as a tool to target individuals, including religious minorities and public figures.","Pakistani YouTube star Rajab Butt has been charged with blasphemy following the launch of his perfume named ""295,"" a reference to Pakistan’s controversial blasphemy laws.

QUETTA: The Balochistan government , under the leadership of chief minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti , has decided to take stringent measures against government employees involved in anti-state activities , as reported by ARY News.In a high-level meeting chaired by CM Bugti, which was attended by the IG Balochistan and the chief secretary, the government announced that it would target individuals involved in anti-state propaganda and activism.According to ARY News, CM Bugti instructed all commissioners and district officers to act swiftly against any government employees suspected of promoting anti-state narratives or participating in activities that challenge the state's authority. The government's move appears to be a direct attempt to suppress activism and dissent within the province, especially among those critical of the state's policies. Bugti also confirmed that individuals involved in such actions would be placed under strict surveillance by being added to the Fourth Schedule for closer monitoring.ARY News also reported that CM Bugti directed all heads of educational institutions in the province to ensure the national flag is hoisted and the national anthem is recited regularly. Educational leaders who fail to enforce these directives are being told to resign, which signals a heightened crackdown on any form of resistance within these spaces.This renewed focus on stifling activism in Balochistan reflects the government's broader strategy to assert control over the region, including monitoring and potentially silencing any opposition to its policies.This comes amidst the detention of Baloch leaders and activists. Activists in the Balochistan region have frequently organised protests and campaigns, calling attention to the region's marginalisation.In response, governments have implemented harsh crackdowns, often leading to the detention of Baloch leaders and activists. These actions have sparked widespread criticism from international human rights organisations, highlighting concerns over the suppression of political expression and the stifling of peaceful advocacy for regional rights.","The Balochistan government has decided to take stringent measures against government employees involved in anti-state activities.

As he departed for Thailand to participate in the 6th Bimstec summit, PM Narendra Modi asserted India's Northeast lies at the heart of the inter-regional group, underlining the primacy of the northeastern states in the region, days after Bangladesh chief adviser Muhammad Yunus said in China the ""7 sisters"" are landlocked with no way of reaching the ocean. Modi's remark came ahead of a likely bilateral meeting between the two on Friday on the summit's margins.Modi and Yunus came face to face for the first time at the dinner hosted by Thailand PM Paetongtarn Shinawatra.Modi was seated between Yunus and Nepal PM KP Sharma Oli. An Indian govt source speaking on condition of anonymity said the meeting, as sought by Dhaka, is ""in the works"". Senior officials in Dhaka were quoted as saying that the leaders would meet on Friday afternoon, shortly after the Bimstec summit. The meeting, if it happens, would be the first between the leaders since the interim govt took charge in Bangladesh in Aug 2025.Separately, in a Bimstec ministerial, Jaishankar said that the North-East had emerged as a connectivity hub for the Bimstec and the completion of the India-Myanmar-Thailand trilateral highway will connect the region all the way to the Pacific Ocean. This, he said, would be a veritable game-changer.Yunus's office had clarified on Wednesday that his remarks about India's North-East had been made with ""honest intentions"" but were interpreted wrongly. The fact that he was speaking in China, while inviting Beijing to take advantage of Bangladesh's geographical location, raised eyebrows in India.Modi had last week written to Yunus on Bangladesh National Day, extending his felicitations and underlining the significance of working together on the basis of mutual sensitivity to each other's interests and concerns. India also remains concerned about the law-and-order situation in Bangladesh, and the threat to minorities amid increasing radicalisation in the country.According to govt sources, bilateral meetings are likely also with Nepal PM K P Sharma Oli and Myanmar junta chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, who is undertaking a rare visit abroad amid the civil war in the country for Bimstec.In his departure statement, Modi also said that Bimstec has emerged as a significant forum for promoting regional development, connectivity and economic progress in the Bay of Bengal region. ""I look forward to meeting the leaders of the Bimstec countries and engaging productively to further strengthen our collaboration with the interest of our people in mind,"" said Modi.Bimstec or the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation is an inter-regional grouping comprising five South Asian countries and two Asean states, lying in the littoral and adjacent areas of the Bay of Bengal. Bangladesh will take over as the chair of Bimstec at the Bangkok summit.At the last summit in Colombo in 2022, the leaders adopted the Bimstec Charter, completing its transition from a grouping to a regional organisation. With Saarc now non-functional because of the lack of any diplomatic engagement between India and Pakistan, the Indian govt has pushed Bimstec as an alternative for regional trade, connectivity and security. Addressing the Colombo summit, Modi had also called for expediti ng ongoing talks for a Bimstec free trade agreement (FTA) that would enhance mutual trade.The PM will also visit Sri Lanka from Bangkok. ""This follows the highly successful visit of President Dissanayaka to India last Dec. We will have the opportunity to review progress made on the joint vision of fostering partnerships for a shared future and provide further guidance to realise our shared objectives,"" he said in his departure statement.","Modi and Yunus came face to face for the first time at the dinner hosted by Thailand PM Paetongtarn Shinawatra.

No, focus should be on academics Yes, it's important for awareness

KATHMANDU: They were still in the womb or a crib when Narayanhiti Palace became a crime scene. On the night of June 1, 2001, gunfire echoed through the marble halls, leaving nearly the entire royal family, including King Birendra and Queen Aishwarya, dead. Gyanendra Shah, the king no one expected, took the throne days later. But by 2008, amid a peace deal with Maoists and end of a decade-long civil war that left more than 17,000 dead, monarchy was abolished. For Nepal's post- 2000 generation, the palace is more museum than memory.And yet, the past is back. Not as nostalgia whispered in old homes, but as chants - 'Raja aau, desh bachau' - rising from TikTok and Facebook feeds, protest portals, and campuses. In private institutes, youngsters are asking hard questions of the republic. What has it delivered, besides a carousel of prime ministers and a nation in drift? Since becoming a republic in 2008, Nepal has had 13 different PMs, often through fragile coalitions. A school administrator said, ""They've come of age amid rolling blackouts, political instability, and a broken job market. It's not just the changing faces. It's the lack of direction. Every few months, there's a new education policy... a different entrance exam.""In classrooms where teachers once prepped students for exams and jobs, conversations now veer into who should lead the country - elected politicians or a king - and whether their votes would matter at all. ""We're supposed to be teaching maths and science,"" said Sagar Acharya, a principal in Chitwan. ""But these days, it feels like we're moderating parliament."" Smriti Acharya, a 20-year-old student, never imagined she'd attend a protest rally. ""I didn't live through the monarchy... But I've lived through this system - and it's not working."" Her friend added, ""When every year brings a new PM, what future are we supposed to plan for?""The churn isn't just political - it's personal. Students watch classmates vanish abroad in search of something better. According to International Organisation for Migration, over 3,00,000 students have left the country for higher education in past five years. Nepal's department of foreign employment said over 1,10,000 student visa recommendations were issued in 2022. Student absenteeism has spiked since the March 28 crackdown on protests. Even in schools that avoid overt political discussion, the tensions are palpable. ""There's a strange energy right now - a hunger to belong to something larger than themselves,"" said a teacher. Sociologist Tara Rai said the protests are more than just a royalist revival. ""This is a generation that has only known chaos. The generation's activism is rooted in disillusionment, not nostalgia. For them, the king is less a figure than a symbol - of order, identity, something to rally around.""For many, though, monarchy is not the solution. ""Given the choice, I'd still opt for a democracy,"" said another student. ""It may be messy, but it gives us rights and a chance to participate. I just want a system that works."" Despite rising tensions, education ministry has issued no formal advisory. But insiders say informal instructions have been sent to ""avoid sensitive political discussion"" in classrooms.

Dhawal Shumsher is India’s damaad: Daughter Shivangini Rana,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/dhawal-shumsher-is-indias-damaad-daughter-shivangini-rana/articleshow/119845231.cms,"Dhawal Shumsher Rana

KATHMANDU: Nepal MP Dhawal Shumsher Rana ’s daughter, Shivangini Rana , has described her father as “India’s damaad”, pointing to a network of deep personal, educational, and royal family ties between their household in Nepal and families across India. Rana has been in jail since Saturday for his alleged role in the pro-monarchy protests in which 2 people, including a journalist, were killed on Friday.Speaking to TOI, Shivangini said she studied at Mayo College Girls’ School in Ajmer, graduating in 2007. Her mother, Pratima Rana, studied at Loreto schools in Kolkata and Shillong and later attended Lady Brabourne College, Kolkata. “We’ve lived across India — in Calcutta, Shillong, Ajmer. India is home in many ways,” Shivangini said.The family's personal links span several Indian states. “My eldest aunt is married into the royal family of Dumraon in Bihar. Another aunt is married to the Kawardha royal family in Chhattisgarh. Pradyot Deb Barman, the erstwhile maharaja of Tripura, is my uncle,” she said.Shivangini’s grandmother is Padma Raje Scindia, the eldest daughter of Jivajirao Scindia, the last ruling maharaja of Gwalior, and Vijaya Raje Scindia, one of the founding members of the BJP. Her grandmother’s sister is Vasundhara Raje, the former chief minister of Rajasthan and senior BJP leader. “My mother’s maika is in India. That makes my father India’s damaad,” she said with a smile.Dhawal belongs to Nepal’s powerful Rana dynasty , which held absolute power as hereditary prime ministers from 1846 until the democratic transition in 1951. The dynasty’s rule began with Jung Bahadur Rana, who rose to power after the Kot massacre and maintained a close alliance with British India throughout his reign.","Nepal MP Dhawal Shumsher Rana has been in jail since Saturday for his alleged role in the pro-monarchy protests in which 2 people, including a journalist, were killed on Friday.

KATHMANDU: Rumours swirled in Kathmandu on Monday that two senior Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP) leaders could face treason charges — a crime punishable by life imprisonment in Nepal — after police produced them in court for involvement in the March 28 pro-monarchy violence in which two persons, including a journalist, were killed. The passports of current MP Dhawal Shumsher Rana and Rabindra Mishra have been revoked, and demands to impound former king Gyanendra Shah ’s passport were raised in parliament, Rana’s family members told TOI on Monday evening.RPP senior vice-president Mishra and general secretary Rana, a member of the lower house, were remanded in custody for five days by Kathmandu district court judge Taradevi Maharjan. The court permitted further investigation under charges related to crimes against the state. The duo were among 11 people presented in court on Monday, said court information officer Deepak Kumar Shrestha. Mishra was handcuffed; Rana was not.Rana’s daughter Shivangini told TOI that her father had been diagnosed with cancer in Nepal and treated at the Head and Neck Cancer Institute of India in Mumbai in September. He had just completed a round of radiation therapy and was due to return to India for follow-up treatment, but was not allowed to leave. “I won’t be surprised if they (govt) slap ridiculous charges against him,” she said. “Their passports have also been impounded. Neither he nor Mishra can leave the country now. He was due for treatment in India, but it is now clear that he cannot leave Nepal anytime soon.”Shivangini added that the family had been informed verbally by officials that the passports of both leaders were being held “until further notice”, but no formal communication had been received.Meanwhile, during a session of the federal parliament on Monday, lawmakers from the ruling coalition demanded that former king Gyanendra Shah’s passport also be impounded in connection with the violent demonstrations. Rastriya Janamorcha MP Chitra Bahadur KC said that a thorough investigation into the former king’s role was “essential to protect the republic”.Ramhari Sharma Kafle, chief of the Kathmandu district public prosecutor ’s office, said Mishra, Rana and others may be charged with crimes against the state after preliminary investigation. Of the nearly 200 persons – locals, members of various political parties – arrested and detained so far, police have produced 42 people in court, including those held under charges of criminal mischief and organised crime. The rest are under further investigation, police said.According to officials, the March 28 ‘ Janadolan ’ — led by Durga Prasai’s Nepal Royalist Movement — turned violent and led to widespread vandalism in Kathmandu. Protesters allegedly damaged homes, a hospital, vehicles, and a political party office, and looted a shopping mall. They also reportedly seized a weapon from the armed police. The aam sabha was led by Prasai. Rana was called in as a moral supporter and guest. Businessman-activist Prasai was appointed its ""people’s commander"".Police said Prasai has been on the run since Friday’s protest. On Sunday, he released a video on Facebook saying he was staying in a temple in the capital. Meanwhile, police arrested Gopal Malla, 38, from Bhimsen Gola for allegedly stealing a gas gun from an armed police officer during the violence. The gun has not yet been recovered. Malla, originally from Sainamaina municipality in Rupandehi, now resides in Tarakeshwar-10, Kathmandu.In another development, Kathmandu Metropolitan City has fined Gyanendra Shah Nepalese Rs 793,000 (INR 4 lakh) for protest-related damage. Officials issued the fine over multiple infractions, including littering streets, breaking public railings and damaging fire engines used during the protest. The city police attempted to deliver the letter at Gyanendra’s estate Nirmal Niwas but were turned away by his staff. The notice was subsequently sent by post.Shivangini added that Rana was among the few MPs to oppose foreign influence in Nepal’s political affairs. “In Parliament, he was the only MP who spoke against over 100 million dollars that came into Nepal to promote secularism and conversion,” she said, referencing remarks made by former US president Donald Trump.According to Shivangini, her father supports restoring Nepal as a Hindu kingdom. “He believes bringing back the monarchy and Hindu Rashtra can restore dignity and unite the people. The current democratic system and elected parties have failed the country. He always says, ‘To change the situation, we must change the system.’”On the day of the protest, she said Rana was not the organiser but attended as coordinator of the Janandolan committee. “It was organised by Durga Prasai. My father was present to speak, but before he could, tear gas shells landed on the stage. Everyone ran,” she said. “There were others who provoked the crowd. My father wasn’t one of them. He was unarmed, standing in the middle of the road.”Shivangini showed TOI the video footage that she said showed Rana urging protestors not to resort to violence. “Even after police began firing tear gas, he was asking people not to throw stones and trying to manage the crowd,” she said. “Yet they are talking about charging him with treason.” She said Rana’s driver was shot twice during the protest. “He was just standing next to my father. That bullet could have hit him.”She also alleged the police action was premeditated. “Officers were stationed on rooftops. As soon as we started the national anthem, tear gas rained down. The crowd hadn’t even fully gathered yet. It was all staged,” she said. “We’ve always said our protest will be peaceful, like Mahatma Gandhi’s. We don’t believe in violence.”Shivangini said the govt is deliberately building a case against her father. “There’s fear in the govt. This movement has shaken the country. People are fed up with corruption and political failure. That’s why they want to silence voices like his.”",Two senior Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP) leaders could face treason charges. The passports of current MP Dhawal Shumsher Rana and Rabindra Mishra have been revoked. RPP senior vice-president Mishra and general secretary Rana were remanded in custody for five days.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119841022,imgsize-48508,width-400,resizemode-4/Nepal-protest-.jpg"

Breast cancer is a condition where malignant (cancer) cells form in the breast tissues. It is the second most common cancer in women worldwide, and rarely occurs in men. If detected early, breast cancer is fully treatable, and most breast cancer survivors go on to live healthy, full lives. Like it is with all cancers, the symptoms may be mild at first, and usually unnoticeable, but it is important to keep a check, especially if someone in your blood line has had breast cancer (sibling, mother, maternal aunt etc). Here are 5 early symptoms of breast cancer that should not be overlooked...One of the subtle signs of breast cancer is a change in the skin texture on the breast, which can look like dimpling or puckering. This is sometimes described as resembling the skin of an orange. These changes happen when cancer cells block lymph vessels under the skin, causing swelling and thickening. The skin may look tight, rough, or have small dents. Because these changes can be mistaken for skin conditions like eczema, they are often overlooked.Nipple changes are another early symptom that many women miss. These changes include sudden nipple inversion (where the nipple pulls inward instead of pointing outward), nipple retraction, or unusual nipple discharge.The discharge may be clear, bloody, or appear without squeezing and usually happens in only one breast. While some nipple changes can be harmless, sudden changes or persistent nipple discharge should never be ignored, as they can indicate breast cancer.Breast cancer can spread to nearby lymph nodes before a lump is noticeable in the breast itself. Swelling or lumps under the arm or near the collarbone may be one of the first signs of this spread. These lumps may feel firm, tender, or irregular in shape. Because they are outside the breast, they can be easily overlooked or mistaken for swollen lymph nodes due to infection.Fatigue is a common symptom in daily life, and is usually overlooked. However, persistent, chronic fatigue (and not the daily tiredness) that does not improve with rest, can be an early sign of breast cancer. This happens because the body uses a lot of energy fighting cancer and dealing with inflammation. If fatigue is accompanied by other symptoms like weight loss or loss of appetite, it is important to seek medical advice promptly.Many women experience breast pain related to their menstrual cycle or minor injuries, so they often dismiss breast pain as normal. However, persistent, localized pain in one area of the breast or nipple that does not go away and is not linked to hormonal changes needs to be checked out. This pain may feel sharp, burning, or throbbing and should not be ignored, especially if it is new or different from usual breast discomfort. Persistent pain can sometimes indicate inflammation or a growing tumor that needs medical attention. However, it needs to be noted that pain is not the primary sign of breast cancer, and is usually not related to early stage cancer.","Breast cancer is the second most common cancer in women worldwide.

Kuldeep Yadav hints at spin-friendly wicket ahead of England Test series





NEW DELHI: Former England spinner Graeme Swann has stirred up controversy ahead of the much-anticipated five-Test series between India and England, calling the clash a “perfect warm-up for the Ashes.”His comments, which were meant to galvanise Ben Stokes’s side, have instead drawn widespread criticism from fans and pundits who see them as a disrespectful downplay of India’s stature in world cricket.Set to begin on June 20 at Headingley, the series marks England’s return to Test action after a lacklustre World Test Championship campaign.Swann suggested the home series could serve as a confidence builder for England before their trip Down Under later this year.However, critics argue that treating a heavyweight encounter against India, ranked among the top Test sides, as mere preparation for the Ashes reflects a narrow and outdated mindset.“It's kind of a perfect warm-up for the Ashes series. India is a huge series,” Swann told Sky Sports Cricket.""Last 2-3 times, we have gone to India, and we were thoroughly outplayed. So, in our own backyard, our home turf, we need to beat India.We need to play well.“They don't have Virat Kohli or Rohit Sharma, their two superstars with the bat. Yes, they've got great players coming up instead, but we've got bowlers who exploit our conditions well. England must look to win this series. I will take 4-1, 3-2 at best. I hope we do well and get the confidence moving into the Ashes.”Following these comments, Swann faced heavy backlash on social media.India, under Shubman Gill’s leadership, have arrived in Leeds with a potent mix of emerging and experienced players. Young pacer Harshit Rana has been added to the squad, further bolstering India’s pace attack. Having previously represented India A, Rana is expected to be a valuable asset on English pitches.The Indian team had a brief tune-up in the form of an intra-squad game against India A, offering key players like KL Rahul and Yashasvi Jaiswal some much-needed match practice.As the first Test approaches, Swann’s comments continue to spark debate. For many, it’s a stark reminder of how English cricket, at times, clings to its Ashes-centric worldview, often to the detriment of appreciating world-class contests like India vs England.",Former England spinner Graeme Swann has stirred up controversy ahead of the much-anticipated five-Test series between India and England.

India is a huge series. The last two or three times we’ve gone to India, we’ve been thoroughly outplayed. So, in our own backyard, on home turf, we need to beat India.

She repeated US President Trump's stance that Iran must not be allowed to develop nuclear weapons.Trump is reportedly considering direct military involvement alongside Israel. According to CBS News, US defence and intelligence officials are closely watching Iran’s Fordo nuclear site. The underground facility is thought to be a key part of Iran’s uranium enrichment programme.On Tuesday, air raid sirens sounded across northern Israel as Iranian missiles were detected. This marked the seventh wave of alerts since midnight, according to the Israeli military.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) issued an urgent alert asking residents of District 18 in Tehran to leave the area.The IDF said it planned further strikes on Iranian military infrastructure there.Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps said it used Fattah-1 hypersonic missiles in its latest round of attacks.

"UAE waives overstay fines for iranians stranded amid Israel-Iran conflict, valid until end of 2025",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-waives-overstay-fines-for-iranians-stranded-amid-israel-iran-conflict-valid-until-end-of-2025/articleshow/121917640.cms,"Iranians eligible for the UAE’s overstay fine waiver must register via the ICP smart services platform or visit customer happiness centres/ Image Generated by AI for creative and illustrative purpose.





In a significant humanitarian gesture, the United Arab Emirates has waived all overstay fines for Iranian nationals, including both residents and visitors, regardless of the visa category under which they entered the country. The announcement was made on Tuesday, June 17, by the Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Port Security (ICP).The authority clarified that this decision was made “in response to the exceptional circumstances that the region is witnessing and to provide relief to this group of people who were unable to return to their homeland, due to the closure of airspace and the suspension of flights.”This move follows days of escalating conflict in the Middle East. Since Friday, Israel and Iran have been engaged in a direct air conflict, with Israel launching attacks on nuclear and military sites within Iran. In response, Iran has fired missiles into Israeli territory. As of Tuesday, the conflict has entered its fifth day, severely disrupting commercial air traffic and stranding travelers across the region.The exemption for Iranian nationals was issued under the directives of UAE President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan.The ICP said that the directive aims to provide immediate support to Iranian citizens affected by the conflict-induced travel disruptions.The decision applies to all Iranians present in the UAE, regardless of their visa type or duration of stay. It is part of a broader strategy by the UAE to respond swiftly to international humanitarian needs caused by conflict or crisis.To avail of the waiver, Iranian nationals are encouraged to register through the UAE's smart services platform or visit ICP customer happiness centres located across the country. The exemption is not automatic and requires eligible individuals to complete the registration process.The ICP confirmed that the exemption will remain in effect until December 31, 2025. This generous timeframe offers relief and flexibility for Iranian nationals unable to return home due to airspace closures and geopolitical instability.This is not the first time the UAE has taken such measures in response to conflict. Just last month, Sudanese nationals in the UAE were also granted full exemption from fines related to both residence and entry permits. That policy took effect on May 19, 2025, and was similarly aimed at easing the humanitarian burden caused by the crisis in Sudan.The ICP emphasized that both the Iranian and Sudanese exemptions reflect the UAE's ongoing commitment to supporting affected communities and align with its national efforts to strengthen social and humanitarian well-being among residents.","The United Arab Emirates has waived all overstay fines for Iranian nationals.

Iran retaliates with over 100 missiles and drone strikes





The conflict between Israel and Iran continued to escalate for a fifth day pushing the region to the edge of a full-scale war. Over the night the region witnessed marked missile exchanges, drone interceptions and urgent evacuation orders.As air raid sirens blared in Israel and explosions lit up the skies over Tehran, US President Donald Trump cut short his appearance at the G7 summit in Canada, warning civilians to “immediately evacuate Tehran.” He later posted from Air Force One that “IRAN CAN NOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON,” signalling an increasingly hardline stance.With death tolls rising, evacuation orders issued for hundreds of thousands, and regional airspace grinding to a halt, the situation has sparked fears of a much larger regional conflagration. Despite the bloodshed, Trump insists Iran still wants a deal, even as his military team gathers in Washington and Israel claims total control over Iranian skies.The Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) have announced the elimination of Ali Shadmani, Iran's newly appointed wartime Chief of Staff, in a targeted airstrike on central Tehran. The IDF stated that following ""a sudden opportunity overnight,"" Israeli Air Force fighter jets struck a manned command centre, killing Shadmani, who was described as ""the most senior military commander and the closest figure to Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.Shadmani had assumed his position just days earlier, succeeding Gholam Ali Rashid, who was also killed in an Israeli strike. The IDF noted that Shadmani had commanded both the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and the Iranian armed forces, and his death represents a significant blow to Iran's military leadership. This operation marks the second such elimination within five days, following the death of his predecessor.The ministry of external affairs (MEA) on Tuesday confirmed that Indian students in Tehran have been moved out of the city for safety reasons, with arrangements made by the Embassy of India. In light of the worsening security situation, other Indian residents who are self-sufficient in terms of transport have also been advised to relocate to safer areas outside the capital.“Indian students in Tehran have been moved out of the city for reasons of safety, through arrangements made by the Embassy. Other residents who are self-sufficient in terms of transport have also been advised to move out of the city in view of the developing situation,” the MEA said.The ministry also stated that some Indian nationals had been assisted in leaving Iran through the border with Armenia.The Embassy remains in regular contact with the Indian community and continues to offer all feasible assistance. “Further advisories may be issued given the fluid situation,” the MEA added.The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed that Iran had launched another salvo of missiles toward Israel in the early hours of Tuesday. Air raid sirens sounded across northern Israel, and residents were ordered to take shelter. While the IDF’s defence systems intercepted many of the missiles. “We will defend American interests,” said White House spokesperson Alex Pfeiffer, confirming US forces remained in a defensive posture. Despite the fresh attacks, there were no immediate reports of casualties or damage from the latest barrage.From Canada’s G7 summit, President Donald Trump issued a warning: “Everyone should immediately evacuate Tehran!” He reiterated on Truth Social that “IRAN CAN NOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON,” and blamed Iran for not signing the deal he had proposed. Soon after the post, the White House announced Trump would return to Washington ahead of schedule “because of what’s going on in the Middle East.” National Security Council members were called into the Situation Room as Trump signalled the US would remain on high alert.The G7 summit in Canada saw a major rift as President Trump refused to endorse a joint statement calling for de-escalation. European leaders, including Emmanuel Macron and Keir Starmer, had pushed for a unified message affirming Israel’s right to self-defence and condemning Iran’s nuclear ambitions. Trump’s refusal blocked consensus. According to CNN, Trump had given Iran a two-month ultimatum earlier this year, and the current strikes were timed to follow that deadline. His exit from the summit symbolised the shifting priorities of US foreign policy amid a rapidly widening conflict.On Monday, Israel’s military issued a mass evacuation warning to around 330,000 people in central Tehran, targeting an area that includes Iran’s state TV headquarters, police buildings, and three major hospitals—one linked to the Revolutionary Guard. The warning comes as part of Israel’s ongoing air campaign against Iran, which has already prompted large-scale displacement.Tehran, home to roughly 9.5 million people, has seen a surge in people fleeing the city. One resident, Alireza, told The Washington Post he left for Gilan province after an airstrike hit near his home: “We were lucky to leave very early… the roads got really crowded.”Both The Post and The New York Times reported long queues at petrol stations, with some resorting to rationing, after Israel targeted vital energy infrastructure including refineries and fuel depots.China’s embassy in Israel on Tuesday urged its citizens to leave the country “as soon as possible” . In a statement on WeChat, the embassy advised Chinese nationals to exit via land border crossings, “on the precondition that they can guarantee their personal safety,” adding, “It is recommended to depart in the direction of Jordan.” The embassy warned that the conflict is “continuing to escalate,” noting, “Much civilian infrastructure has been damaged, civilian casualties are on the rise, and the security situation is becoming more serious. ”Air travel was thrown into chaos as airspace closures rippled across the region. Iran’s skies remain entirely shut, while Israel closed Ben Gurion Airport “until further notice.” Airports in Iraq and parts of Lebanon also shut down, leaving tens of thousands stranded. “The domino effect here is massive,” aviation safety expert John Cox told AP. Flights were grounded, crews misplaced, and airlines faced mounting losses as the region braced for further escalation.Despite the military escalation, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth told Fox News that President Trump was still open to a nuclear deal with Iran. “We are postured defensively in the region to be strong in pursuit of a peace deal,” Hegseth said, confirming he was en route to the Situation Room to brief the president. Trump echoed the sentiment at the G7, suggesting Iran was “at the negotiating table” and that “a deal will be signed.” Yet his statements were coupled with warnings and calls for evacuation, reflecting a dual-track strategy.Iran’s counter-offensive has grown fiercer. The Islamic Republic fired over 100 ballistic missiles overnight, bringing the total launched since Friday to more than 370. Iranian officials also confirmed three drone strikes on the South Pars gas complex, the country’s main production hub. The attacks, they said, were in direct retaliation for Israeli airstrikes that have so far killed at least 224 people in Iran. Officials vowed further responses to what they termed “aggression against the homeland.”","The conflict between Israel and Iran continued to escalate for a fifth day pushing the region to the edge of a full-scale war. US President Donald Trump cut short his appearance at the G7 summit in Canada, warning civilians to “immediately evacuate Tehran” He later posted from Air Force One that “IRAN CAN NOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON,” signalling an increasingly hardline stance. Despite the bloodshed, Trump insists Iran still wants a deal.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121903847,imgsize-984135,width-400,resizemode-4/121903847.jpg"

WASHINGTON: The aircraft carrier USS Nimitz was leaving Southeast Asia on Monday after cancelling plans to dock in Vietnam, amid reports it is headed to West Asia to boost the US presence as Israel and Iran do battle.At 13.45 GMT, the carrier was travelling through the Malacca Strait toward the Indian Ocean, according to Marine Traffic, a ship-tracking site.A Vietnamese government official confirmed that a planned reception aboard the USS Nimitz on June 20, as part of the ship's expected June 19-23 visit to Danang, had been cancelled.

HELLSCAPE Tel Aviv! Iran’s Terrifying Attack Quakes Israeli City; IDF ‘Fails’ To Intercept Missiles

'Evacuate NOW': Iran's Terrifying BOMBING Threat To Israeli Media Houses After State TV Attack





Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday accused Iran of pushing the region toward a ""forever war"" and warned the situation is approaching the ""brink of a nuclear war.""In a wide-ranging interview with ABC News, Netanyahu argued that the only way to end hostilities is by directly targeting the Iranian regime's leadership - including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.When asked about reports that US President Donald Trump rejected an Israeli proposal to assassinate Khamenei due to fears of escalation, Netanyahu countered, ""It's not going to escalate the conflict, it's going to end the conflict.""The remarks come as tensions between Israel and Iran have surged since a wave of airstrikes and missile exchanges erupted late last week. Netanyahu squarely blamed Iran for regional instability, pointing to its alleged involvement in attacks across the Middle East.""We've had half a century of conflict spread by this regime that terrorizes everyone in the Middle East; has bombed the Aramco oil fields in Saudi Arabia; is spreading terrorism and subversion and sabotage everywhere,"" he said.""The 'forever war' is what Iran wants, and they're bringing us to the brink of nuclear war. In fact, what Israel is doing is preventing this, bringing an end to this aggression, and we can only do so by standing up to the forces of evil.""Asked directly if Israel would target Iran’s supreme leader, Netanyahu responded, ""We're doing what we need to do."" He added, ""I'm not going to get into the details, but we've targeted their top nuclear scientists. It's basically Hitler's nuclear team.""Netanyahu appealed to American interests, warning that the threat Iran poses is not limited to Israel. ""Today, it's Tel Aviv. Tomorrow, it's New York. Look, I understand 'America First'. I don't understand 'America Dead'. That's what these people want. They chant 'Death to America.'""""So we're doing something that is in the service of mankind, of humanity, and it's a battle of good against evil. America does, should, and does stand with the good. That's what President Trump is doing, And I deeply appreciate his support,"" he said.The Israeli leader also dismissed a Wall Street Journal report that Iran is seeking to de-escalate and resume nuclear talks. ""I'm not surprised. I mean, they want to continue to have these fake talks in which they lie, they cheat, they string the US along. And, you know, we have very solid Intel on that,"" he said. ""They want to keep on building their nuclear weapons and building their mass ballistic missile arsenal, which they're firing at our people. ""He rejected the idea of halting strikes in exchange for renewed diplomacy, adding, ""They want to continue to create the two existential threats against Israel while they're talking. That's not going to happen.""When asked about criticism from US conservatives like commentator Tucker Carlson who oppose military support for Israel, Netanyahu reiterated the global threat he believes Iran poses: ""Iran is a threat to the entire world.""The Israeli PM again echoed his recent birthday message to President Trump, saying, ""We're not just fighting our enemy. We're fighting your enemy. For God's sake, they chant, 'death to Israel, death to America.' We're simply on their way. And this could reach America soon.""Pressed on whether he would halt military action if President Trump requested a diplomatic pause, Netanyahu was non-committal but praised Trump’s leadership: ""Well, President Trump has been a great leader, a great leader of the world, and a great leader and a great friend of Israel, and he put forward the terms very clearly in the negotiations.""""He said Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon, and in order for it not to have a nuclear weapon, it cannot have the capacity to enrich uranium, which is the prerequisite for nuclear weapons.""","Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Iran is pushing the region toward a ""forever war"" Netanyahu argued that the only way to end hostilities is by directly targeting the Iranian regime's leadership - including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

As night attacks stretch into Tuesday morning, global leaders express concern while military actions intensify between Israel and Iran. Confrontation have escalated sharply, with fresh explosions reported in Tehran late Monday night.State-linked Fars News Agency said Iran’s air defences were activated over the capital after blasts were heard in the eastern part of the city.Iran’s Revolutionary Guards announced the ninth wave of drone and missile strikes targeting Israel. A spokesman for the Guards said these attacks would continue “without interruption until dawn,” highlighting Iran’s intent to sustain pressure overnight.In a retaliatory warning, Iranian authorities have told Israel to evacuate the headquarters of Channels 12 and 14. This followed an Israeli airstrike on IRINN, a state-run television channel in Tehran on Monday, which forced a news presenter to flee during a live broadcast.Iranian authorities have claimed that they uncovered and shut down a drone manufacturing site in Tehran allegedly linked to Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency. According to Iranian state media, two individuals accused of working with Mossad were arrested in separate operations in Tehran and Alborz provinces.The Israel Defence Forces have confirmed missile detections across several areas following Iran’s latest wave of attacks. Sirens were activated as part of emergency procedures, and the Israeli Air Force has launched strikes on missile infrastructure in western Iran. Israeli officials claim to have achieved air superiority over Tehran, saying that a significant portion of Iran’s missile launchers has already been destroyed.The United States has moved quickly to adjust its military posture in the Middle East. Defence secretary Pete Hegseth confirmed the deployment of additional assets to the region, saying the move is meant to enhance the safety of American forces. In a statement on social media, Hegseth said, “Protecting US forces is our top priority”.Tehran has submitted a formal complaint to the United Nations, accusing Israel of deliberately targeting its nuclear facilities. In a letter to UN Secretary-General António Guterres and the Security Council, Iran’s representative, Amir Saeid Iravani, cited recent Israeli airstrikes on the Natanz nuclear complex and referred to a 1981 Security Council resolution condemning similar actions.Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has strongly criticised Israel’s actions, saying they undermine ongoing nuclear negotiations with the United States. During calls with foreign ministers from France, Britain, Germany, and the European Union, Araghchi said that Israel’s military aggression is “a blow to diplomacy.”US president Donald Trump has urged Iran to agree to a deal, repeating his warning that Iran must not be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons. In a social media post, he told residents of Tehran to “immediately evacuate” and criticised Iran for not signing the deal he had earlier proposed. Despite the worsening crisis, Trump has not joined other G7 leaders in calling for de-escalation. The White House later confirmed that Trump would leave the G7 summit in Canada a day early to focus on the unfolding conflict.","Iran’s Revolutionary Guards announced the ninth wave of drone and missile strikes targeting Israel.

Longer Weekends and Broader Worker Welfare Measures





Dubai has officially reintroduced its seasonal workplace initiative, ‘Our Flexible Summer’, offering government employees flexible working hours aimed at boosting productivity and enhancing work-life balance during the scorching summer period.The Dubai Government Human Resources Department (DGHR) confirmed that the initiative will run from July 1 to September 12, 2025, and will apply across government entities at each department’s discretion. This follows a successful pilot conducted in 2024.“This is all about supporting a better work-life balance for our government teams,” the DGHR said in a public statement, highlighting the initiative’s aim to make summer “a little cooler” for public sector staff.Under the temporary model, the standard five-day workweek remains in place, but employees can choose from two flexible scheduling options:The choice of implementation is left to each government department, allowing flexibility across different operations.The DGHR stated that the initiative “comes after the successful trial run earlier this year” and is intended to increase employee happiness and overall productivity during the UAE’s peak summer months.The program isn’t new. In 2024, the Dubai Government rolled out a similar model between August 12 and September 30 across 21 government entities.According to data analysed from that pilot, the initiative:The results confirmed that flexible working arrangements could have a measurable impact on both employee wellbeing and departmental performance.This year’s expanded rollout reflects the government’s confidence in the model’s success.Currently, most government employees in Dubai enjoy a two-and-a-half-day weekend, with a half-day on Friday, and full days on Saturday and Sunday. The new schedule will allow some staff to enjoy a full three-day weekend, depending on the group selected.In parallel, the UAE continues to implement additional summer workforce protections, particularly for outdoor and field-based workers.As of June 15, the Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MoHRE) began enforcing the annual midday break, which bans work under direct sunlight from 12:30 PM to 3:00 PM, daily until September 15.MoHRE inspectors have already begun site checks, with fines of Dh5,000 per worker for violations, up to a maximum of Dh50,000 in cases involving multiple breaches.In addition, the ministry has set up over 10,000 air-conditioned rest stations across the country to support delivery service workers, helping them cope with extreme heat during the peak season.","'Our Flexible Summer' initiative will run from July 1 to September 12, 2025.

The UAE’s Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MoHRE) has taken decisive action against several domestic worker recruitment agencies found to be in breach of regulations during the first half of 2025.Among the most significant violations recorded was the failure of some agencies to refund recruitment fees, either partially or fully, to employers within the legally mandated timeframe.

Dubai’s property prices have been on a strong upward trajectory, with a new report revealing how much prices are expected to rise further in 2025. After seeing significant growth in recent months, experts suggest that while the pace of price increases may slow, overall property values will continue to climb steadily throughout the year.According to Haider Tuaima, Managing Director and Head of Real Estate Research at ValuStrat, Dubai’s property prices rose by 8% in the first five months of 2025. The monthly data shows a 1.6% increase in property prices for May 2025 alone, amounting to a total rise of 24.7% since May of the previous year. Villas have been the standout performers in the market.ValuStrat’s monthly analysis highlights the following key points:On the apartment front, ValuStrat reported a 1.1% month-on-month price increase and a 20% rise year-on-year. Areas seeing the highest apartment capital gains include:The lowest increases in apartment values were found in International City (12.3%) and Burj Khalifa (16.4%). Notably, the Burj Khalifa area recently surpassed its previous price peak from 2014.Overall, apartment prices are currently 71.2% above post-pandemic levels but remain 5.8% below the 2014 peak, according to ValuStrat’s analysts.Looking ahead, ValuStrat predicts that Dubai property prices could rise by up to another 10% before the end of 2025. However, this growth is expected to be more moderate compared to the rapid increases seen in recent years.Real estate consultancy JLL provides additional insights into market dynamics, noting that the residential sector is moving towards a balance between supply and demand. JLL stated:“This shift will likely signal a moderation in price growth rates rather than a decrease in property values. As the year progresses, this trend is anticipated to increasingly influence sales prices, potentially leading to a more sustainable growth pattern in the market.”In the first quarter of 2025, JLL reported that sales prices continued climbing driven by strong demand:",Dubai property prices have already surged 24.7% since last May.

Israel Scrambles In STUNNING Drone 'Storm' Minutes After IDF Claims Air Supremacy Over Tehran





A growing sense of fear and panic has taken hold across Iran, particularly in the capital, Tehran, as Israel continues to vow further military strikes. Amid threats of new airstrikes, many Iranians are fleeing major cities in search of safety, with traffic jams clogging roads leading north toward the Caspian Sea.On Monday, the Israeli military issued a chilling warning, urging residents of Tehran to evacuate ""immediately.""""In the coming hours, the Israeli military will operate in the area, as it has in recent days throughout Tehran, to strike military infrastructure of the Iranian regime,"" the post read.A resident of Saadat Abad, an affluent neighbourhood in north Tehran that has reportedly been struck in recent days, described a night filled with explosions. ""Some were so powerful that the building shook,"" the resident told CNN anonymously, citing safety concerns. They described a chaotic scene as smoke poured into nearby buildings, and families rushed to the ground floors, struggling to calm frightened children.Iran's capital is ill-prepared for aerial conflict. Unlike Israeli cities equipped with modern bomb shelters, Tehran must rely on improvised options, basements, tunnels, and shelters dating back to the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s.""There weren't any shelters built in Tehran,"" said Mehdi Chamran, chairman of Tehran's city council. ""People went into basements. The metro could be used in an extreme crisis, but we would need to shut the system down.""Despite the looming threat, much of daily life continues. Grocery store shelves remain stocked, and events go ahead as planned. But long lines for fuel have become common, with gas rationed and capped at 25 litres per customer. Some ATMs are limiting cash withdrawals, residents say, adding to the tension.Cities beyond the capital are also showing signs of distress. In Shiraz, in south-central Iran, residents are lining up for gasoline and stockpiling essentials like water and diapers. Images show cars loaded with families and supplies heading toward rural areas.Nighttime in Tehran, however, tells a different story. Streets fall eerily quiet, many shops remain shuttered, and those who haven't left are increasingly reluctant to go to work.The situation follows a series of Israeli strikes on Iranian military infrastructure, including nuclear facilities in Natanz and Isfahan, which have heightened international concerns.","Israel issues chilling warning, urging residents of Tehran to evacuate ""immediately"" Iran's capital is ill-prepared for aerial conflict.

Three days after a major fire broke out in Dubai Marina ’s Tiger Tower, also known as The Marina Pinnacle, the community response has been nothing short of extraordinary. As emergency crews continue to investigate the cause of the fire that erupted on Friday evening, residents across Dubai have mobilized to help the displaced.The Dubai Media Office confirmed that all 3,820 residents from 764 apartments in the 67-storey building were safely evacuated. No injuries were reported. The blaze, which began around 9:30pm, was brought under control within six hours, and emergency teams remained on-site through the weekend. While the charred upper floors remain sealed, many tenants are now grappling with the challenge of temporary displacement.Much of the relief effort has been coordinated through two WhatsApp groups titled ""Support Group to Help"", both initiated by Dr Deepti Arora, an HR manager at a luxury retail company. The groups quickly grew past their member limits as hundreds joined in to offer food, clothing, transport, and toiletries.“We've arranged 35 non-veg and 15 veg meals for one of the buildings today,” a member posted on Sunday.A pinned message reads: ""The past two days have seen immense generosity with donations pouring in from all over.The locations are now full, so please stop all donations, perishable and non-perishable. All locations remain open for those in need of clothes, food, and water.""Dr Deepti shared with Khaleej Times that the idea stemmed from a call she received from a distressed employee, a young man from Brazil who lived in the building.“I tried to take the tram to check on him, but it wasn't working. So, I followed the smoke and walked to the building,” she recalled. “What I saw was gut-wrenching.”Motivated by what she witnessed, she quickly created the WhatsApp group and laid clear rules: no cash donations, only essentials like food, clothing, undergarments, and toiletries.“Within hours, our group crossed a thousand members, and I had to start a second one,” she toldAnother citizen-driven support initiative was launched by Sevgi Anar, a Sydney-born health and fitness professional living on the 72nd floor of a nearby tower. She was among the first to notice the fire.“People in our building were shouting across to the tower, trying to alert residents,” she said. “It was hard to tell who had seen the smoke and who hadn't. Everyone just acted instinctively.”The following morning, while walking her dog, she found two men sleeping near a tram station — their feet covered in soot. Upon learning they had escaped the fire, Sevgi and a friend booked them into Rove Dubai Marina Hotel for the night.As more displaced tenants reached out, Sevgi created a WhatsApp group titled, now with around 150 members, focused solely on providing emergency housing.“Ten boys, mostly Asian, were roughing it out near Princess Tower. We found them an apartment. Later that night, we put four more into Rove just for the night,” she shared.One grateful resident posted the next day:“My roommates and I were able to sleep peacefully last night. Thank you, everyone.”While the building’s management has provided temporary accommodation to residents with tenancy or ownership contracts, including at Nobles Tower in Business Bay, those in shared accommodations have struggled to find shelter.An Indian resident from the 20th floor said:“I was told to go to Nobles Tower, but by the time I reached, it was full.”He is now staying at Staybridge Suites in Dubai Internet City with support from his company. His wife, who had just left for India two days prior, is expected to return this week.Another account came from Ross, an Azerbaijani expat living on the 60th floor. He was among the first to notice the fire:“It started small. I thought it was coming from the 62nd floor and went up to check, but then I realised it was the floor right above mine. We tried using extinguishers and then the fire hoses, but it was too intense. Once Civil Defence arrived, we ran down the stairs.”Ross sustained a minor injury from a balcony door that shattered from the heat. He was treated by paramedics.“The firefighters arrived quickly and handled it very efficiently. I am really thankful for how fast they took control.”The network of help has extended beyond shelter and food. One message in the support group read:“Dear friends, we are a family with three kids and a small dog and urgently need a place to stay.”A response followed almost immediately:“I have a vacant villa in Dubai Hills. It's unfurnished, but power and water are available. You can stay for a week.”Several businesses also stepped in:“It's just our way to pitch in,” said Mary, the lounge’s marketing manager. “These women have been through a lot. We wanted to offer a bit of relief.”As investigations continue and residents await clearance to return, what remains clear is the strength of community bonds in Dubai.“Dubai isn't only home,” said one volunteer as they packed essentials. “It's where we look out for each other.”","Residents across Dubai have mobilized to help the displaced. WhatsApp groups with over 1,000 members coordinated urgent aid for Marina Pinnacle residents. All 3,820 residents from 764 apartments in the 67-storey building were safely evacuated. The blaze, which began around 9:30pm, was brought under control within six hours.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121891029,imgsize-1165649,width-400,resizemode-4/121891029.jpg"

Greater integration of the region's tourism offerings under a unified travel policy









The long-anticipated GCC unified tourist visa has officially been approved and will be rolled out in the near future, according to Abdulla bin Touq Al Marri, UAE’s Minister of Economy. The move is seen as a critical milestone that could reshape the region’s travel landscape, enabling seamless tourism across all six member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC): the UAE, Saudi Arabia , Bahrain, Qatar, Oman, and Kuwait Confirming the development, Abdulla bin Touq Al Marri, Minister of Economy of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), said that the unified visa has already been approved and is currently awaiting rollout. Speaking on the sidelines of the UAE Hospitality Summer Camp press conference held on Monday, June 16, 2025, Al Marri told Khaleej Times:“The single (GCC) tourist visa has been approved and waiting now to be implemented, hopefully, soon. Now, it is with the Ministry of Interior and the relevant stakeholders and they should look into it.”The visa, sometimes referred to as the ""GCC Grand Tours Visa"", is designed to function similarly to the Schengen visa in Europe, which allows tourists to travel freely across participating countries with a single permit. This unified document will simplify travel by eliminating the need to apply for separate visas to each country in the Gulf bloc, despite the countries being well-connected by air and road.Leaders across the travel and hospitality sectors have welcomed the approval of the unified GCC tourist visa, calling it a “game-changer” for the region’s tourism industry and broader economies. Industry executives believe the new visa will significantly enhance tourism flows between the six Gulf nations by making cross-border travel more accessible and convenient for international visitors.A major expected outcome is the rise of ""bleisure"" travel, a blend of business and leisure, as visitors are more likely to extend their stays to explore neighbouring destinations while on work trips. This, in turn, could lead to longer average trip durations and a more even distribution of tourist spending across the region.The unified visa is also seen as a catalyst for economic growth beyond tourism alone. Industry leaders anticipate that easier cross-border access will stimulate new job creation, attract investment in hospitality and infrastructure, and encourage greater regional collaboration in promoting the Gulf as a single, cohesive destination.The visa rollout comes on the back of strong post-pandemic recovery figures in the Gulf's travel sector. According to data released by the Statistical Centre for the Cooperation Council for the Arab Countries of the Gulf, the region recorded:In the UAE specifically, tourism continues to drive national economic growth. As per the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC):Dubai, already a global tourism magnet, is setting the pace. According to figures from the Dubai Department of Economy and Tourism, the emirate welcomed:Such numbers reinforce Dubai’s position as a central hub in the GCC’s broader tourism ecosystem. With the unified visa coming into effect, other cities and countries in the region stand to benefit from Dubai’s traffic through extended itineraries and regional travel circuits.While an exact rollout date has not yet been publicly confirmed, the unified visa has been officially approved and is now under review by the Ministry of Interior and other relevant authorities in the UAE and across the GCC. Multiple Gulf ministers and senior officials have indicated in recent months that the unified visa will be introduced “soon.”Once implemented, the visa will enable:This initiative not only aligns with long-term regional integration goals but also aims to make the GCC a more attractive destination for international tourists by offering a smoother and more expansive travel experience.","The Schengen-style GCC unified tourist visa, approved by Gulf states, will allow travelers seamless access to all six member countries with a single entry permit.

Families Caught Off Guard and Facing Financial Strain



Gulf News

Travel Agents Respond to Sudden Demand for Rerouting



Airlines Adjust Routes, Travellers Worry Ahead of Summer Break



Geopolitical Background: Conflict Escalates in the Middle East







As regional tensions between Israel and Iran escalated into a four-day exchange of missile and drone strikes, UAE expatriates holidaying in several Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries, including Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Kazakhstan, found themselves scrambling to return home, often at exorbitant costs.Following the outbreak of conflict, which began with Israeli airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites and escalated into retaliatory attacks that killed three in Israel, several airlines either suspended or rerouted flights across affected airspace. This has left many travellers stranded or forced to secure alternative, often indirect and expensive, flight options.Limnaz Musthafa, a long-time UAE resident working in Sharjah’s facility management sector, had sent his family on their first-ever trip to Baku, Azerbaijan. They arrived on June 12 via Air Arabia Abu Dhabi, but by June 13, just a day later, news of an Air India crash and intensifying conflict led to rapid flight closures.“If I knew this would happen, I would've cancelled their trip,” Limnaz Musthafa told, adding that he has been a UAE resident since 1986.By June 15, all return flights were cancelled. His six-member family, including an infant, was forced to book new tickets with Turkish Airlines for at least Dh6,000($1,635), in addition to the original Dh3,800($1,035) they had already spent.“The fear is there, due to the political situation our safety is compromised,” he told Gulf News from Baku, adding that airfares had “skyrocketed.”Similarly, Kamarudheen Arakkal, 43, faced stress when his son Rayan, a 25-year-old student in Birmingham, was stranded in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, after attending a football camp. Scheduled to return last Friday, the sudden closures meant his father had to secure a new flight via Qatar.“This caught us by surprise,” said Arakkal.The new ticket cost $1,000 (approximately Dh3,670), more than seven times the original Dh500 ticket.UAE-based travel agencies are working around the clock to rebook affected passengers using longer but safer routes. Raheesh Babu, Chief Operating Officer of Musafir.com, speaking to Gulf News, confirmed that travellers were turning to multi-leg flights via Istanbul or Doha to bypass closed or dangerous airspace.“People were caught off-guard,” said Babu, noting that the post-Eid travel boom to CIS countries due to affordable fares contributed to the scale of the issue.According to Babu, about 20 Musafir.com customers are currently booking alternative routes out of affected CIS regions.Afi Ahmad, Chairman of Smart Travels, said that most impacted tourists are stranded in Armenia and Azerbaijan, with others affected in Iran. Fortunately, he noted, the number of travellers returning immediately after Eid was not overwhelming due to a general dip in demand.“Unless it is an emergency, people don’t want to travel,” said Ahmad, highlighting the financial and emotional stress among stranded passengers.In one example shared by travel agents, a family managed to return to the UAE from Azerbaijan via Delhi, a longer and more expensive alternative.Despite the immediate disruptions, analysts say mass cancellations are not inevitable, provided airlines continue to find viable rerouting options.Saj Ahmad, Chief Analyst at StrategicAero Research, said that although a degree of reluctance to fly is expected, it may be balanced by broader geographic travel options and rerouting capabilities.GCC airlines, including Emirates, Etihad, Flydubai, and Air Arabia, can reroute westbound flights to Europe and North America via Egypt and the Mediterranean, and eastbound flights over Oman to the Arabian Sea. However, these detours can significantly increase travel time.The urgency and confusion stem from an escalating military conflict between Israel and Iran. Over a four-day period, Israel launched strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, prompting a retaliatory barrage of missiles and drones from Iran that killed three people in central Israel, including in Tel Aviv.Israel responded with a series of mass airstrikes, which, according to international reports, resulted in the deaths of several senior scientists and military generals within Iran.This violent exchange has ignited fears of a wider regional conflict and triggered urgent travel alerts and advisories from the UAE, Saudi Arabia , and other GCC nations.","UAE families stranded in CIS countries pay over Dh6,000 for rerouted flights via Istanbul, Doha, and Delhi amid Israel-Iran conflict flight cancellations.

'Iran Is Losing War With Israel': Trump's Big Claim Amid Tit-For-Tat Missile Strikes

Video: Iran State TV Bombarded During Live Broadcast; Anchor Screams, Flees Amid Israeli Attack

Why air superiority matters

What Russia couldn’t-and can’t-do

Why the difference?

“All the Russians have is pilots,” Stringer said. “They grow these pilots to drive flying artillery, and that’s it.”

Iran’s fatal miscalculation

The numbers game





In the fourth day of open war between Israel and Iran, both countries are reeling from mutual missile attacks, a mounting civilian toll, and a grim sense that the conflict has only just begun. Israeli jets struck Iranian military, nuclear, and command infrastructure as far east as Mashhad. Iran retaliated by launching hundreds of ballistic missiles and drones into Israeli cities, killing more than two dozen civilians and injuring hundreds.Yet despite the chaos, one strategic truth has crystallized: Israel now owns Iran’s skies. Israeli aircraft are flying unhindered over Iran’s capital, dropping bombs from within Iranian territory-something that the Russian Air Force has conspicuously failed to accomplish in Ukraine after more than three years of war. The contrast is not just tactical; it’s philosophical.The current war began Friday with a surprise Israeli strike that destroyed much of Iran’s top military command, set back its nuclear program, and cratered air defense installations across western Iran. Since then, Israeli air power has dismantled nearly a third of Iran’s surface-to-surface missile launchers and taken out key leaders of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.Meanwhile, Iranian salvos continue to rain down on Tel Aviv, Haifa, and Petah Tikva, with civilian deaths rising by the hour.The destruction on both sides is immense. But Israel, unlike Russia, has secured the rarest-and arguably most decisive-military advantage in modern warfare: unchallenged control of enemy airspace.The Israeli campaign, as devastating as it is, also underscores a broader lesson about 21st-century warfighting: whoever controls the skies controls the tempo, scale, and eventual outcome of the fight.“The two campaigns are showing the fundamental importance of air superiority in order to succeed in your overall military objectives,” retired US Air Force Lt Gen David Deptula told the Wall Street Journal. “In the case of Russia-Ukraine war, you see what happens when neither side can achieve air superiority: stalemate and devolution to attrition-based warfare. In the case of the Israel-Iran war, it allows them unhindered freedom to attack where they possess air superiority over segments of Iran. ”That freedom has translated into a relentless bombing campaign using a blend of fifth-generation stealth F-35s-custom-modified by Israel-and older, more expendable F-15s and F-16s once Iran’s air defenses were degraded. Now, Israel is relying more on cheap, plentiful guided bombs like the JDAM and Spice kits instead of expensive long-range missiles. The effect: more strikes, lower cost, and more devastation.Lt Gen Eyal Zamir, Chief of Staff of the Israeli military, described the offensive with cold precision. “IAF pilots are flying at great risk to their lives, hundreds of kilometers away from Israel, striking hundreds of different targets with precision,” he said.The success stands in stark contrast to Russia’s ongoing frustrations in Ukraine. Despite possessing one of the largest air forces in the world, Russia has failed to establish air dominance over its neighbor. Its jets still do not operate freely over Kyiv or other major Ukrainian cities. Instead, the war has devolved into trench fighting, artillery duels, and long-range missile attacks-precisely the scenario Israeli planners worked to avoid.As per the WSJ report, one reason is qualitative. “The asymmetry in capability between Israel’s air force and Russia’s is vast and can be easily observed,” Michael Kofman, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment and an expert on Russian and Ukrainian militaries, told the WSJ. Israeli pilots fly with tighter integration into cyber and intelligence operations. Their training emphasizes maneuver, autonomy, and real-time decision-making. Russian pilots, by contrast, fly what retired British Air Marshal Edward Stringer calls “flying artillery.”Israel’s air war has benefited from something else: Iran’s glaring strategic blind spots. Over decades, Tehran invested in missile deterrence-not air defense. And when the attacks began, Iran’s air defense system-an ad-hoc mix of S-300s, Chinese knockoffs, and home-built batteries-was overwhelmed.“Iran never relied on air defenses alone to ward off attacks like this. The idea was always to use deterrence,” said Fabian Hinz of the International Institute for Strategic Studies.But deterrence failed. Iran’s strongest deterrent, Hezbollah, was crippled last year and physically cut off by Israel’s destruction of the Syrian corridor. Israeli strikes on Syrian air-defense systems effectively opened a corridor-a “superhighway”-for Israeli planes to reach Iranian airspace unopposed.Unlike Ukraine, which used early US intelligence in 2022 to scatter and conceal its mobile air defenses, Iran was caught by surprise. Israeli intelligence operatives and drones sabotaged key systems on the ground in the hours before the first wave of strikes. Simultaneously, Mossad assassinated top military leaders in their homes.“What Israel did with Iran is what Russia wanted to do with Ukraine,” Israeli analyst Michael Horowitz told the Journal. “But it turned out that the Ukrainian society has a resilience and cannot be so easily penetrated-whereas when it comes to Iran, the regime is so unpopular that it’s easy to find people there who will agree to work with Israel.”For now, Israeli generals believe time is on their side. Iran’s missile attacks continue, but with one-third of its launchers gone and Israeli jets flying freely, the odds are shifting.“It’s a numbers game, and it seems like Israel has the upper hand,” said retired US Air Force Gen. Timothy Ray. “After all, the best way to shoot a missile is on the ground while it’s in a container, and not in the air while it’s flying.”Ray’s comment reveals the brutal calculus behind air campaigns: preemptive destruction isn’t just tactical-it’s strategic, psychological, and political. With Iran reeling and international pressure mounting, Israel may have redefined modern air warfare.Not since the opening days of the Gulf War has a country so swiftly gained dominance over an adversary’s skies. And as Russia grinds on in the mud of eastern Ukraine, Israel has flown past in the stratosphere-proving that supremacy in the air remains the shortest path to power on the ground.(With inputs from agencies)","Despite chaos, one strategic truth has crystallized: Israel now owns Iran's skies.

Gaza: UN rights chief urges governments to 'wake up'





As Israel targeted Iran’s main nuclear enrichment facility in Natanz amid escalating conflict, head of the UN nuclear watchdog agency said that there is a possibility of both radiological and chemical contamination there. However, he asserted that the radiation levels outside the complex are normal.Expressing concern over whether uranium is inhaled or ingested, International Atomic Energy Agency director-general Rafael Mariano Grossi said that it will pose a significant danger. However, he added that risk can be managed with effective measures.""The level of radioactivity outside the Natanz site has remained unchanged and at normal levels, indicating no external radiological impact to the population or the environment from this event,"" he said.While addressing an urgent session of the IAEA's board in Vienna, he informed that no additional damage had been reported at Natanz and the Isfahan nuclear research site since Saturday.However, he cautioned that uranium particles, particularly in the form of uranium hexafluoride gas used during enrichment, can be highly toxic if inhaled or ingested. The chemical is extremely volatile, corrosive, and can cause severe injuries on contact with skin or lungs.Grossi emphasised the need for appropriate protective measures for those working at the site, including respiratory equipment.Recent satellite images analysed by The Associated Press show extensive destruction at Natanz, including several buildings linked to power supply systems. Grossi confirmed that the above-ground portion of the Natanz complex was destroyed, although the underground centrifuge facility appeared to be intact. He warned, however, that the loss of power may have caused unseen damage to sensitive infrastructure.The Israeli strikes also targeted the nuclear research facility in Isfahan, damaging four critical buildings, including a uranium conversion plant. While no radiation leaks were detected at either site, the scale of the attack has raised global concerns.In contrast, Iran's underground Fordo enrichment facility and the Bushehr nuclear power plant, the country's only commercial reactor, were reportedly unharmed. The Tehran Research Reactor also remained unaffected.The United Nations' top human rights official on Monday issued a scathing rebuke of Israel’s ongoing military operations in Gaza, saying they are causing ""horrifying, unconscionable suffering"" for Palestinians. He called on world leaders to act urgently to halt the violence.""The facts speak for themselves,"" said Volker Türk, the UN high commissioner for human rights, in a strongly worded address opening the latest session of the human rights council in Geneva. ""Everyone in government needs to wake up to what is happening in Gaza. All those with influence must exert maximum pressure on Israel and Hamas, to put an end to this unbearable suffering.""","Israel targeted Iran’s main nuclear enrichment facility in Natanz amid escalating conflict.

Hijri New Year 2025: UAE declares June 27 as paid holiday for private sector,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/hijri-new-year-2025-uae-declares-june-27-as-paid-holiday-for-private-sector/articleshow/121887846.cms,"Employees with Saturday-Sunday weekends will enjoy a rare three-day break as Hijri New Year falls on a Friday (Representational Image)

Article No. 2 of the Cabinet resolution states that, except for Eid holidays, official public holidays may be moved to the beginning or end of the week by a Cabinet decision.





Article No. 3 clarifies that if a holiday coincides with a weekend or another public holiday, it will not be carried forward.





Article No. 4 permits local governments to approve additional official holidays not listed in the federal resolution for special occasions or institutional needs.









Friday, June 27, 2025, has been declared an official paid holiday for private sector employees in the United Arab Emirates in observance of the Islamic (Hijri) New Year 1447 AH, according to an announcement issued by the Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (Mohre) on Monday, June 16.The announcement aligns with an earlier confirmation by the Federal Authority for Government Human Resources, which extended the same day off to public sector employees. This reflects the UAE’s unified national holiday policy that ensures both public and private sector workers receive equal official holidays throughout the year.For employees with a standard Saturday-Sunday weekend, this creates a three-day long weekend from June 27 to June 29, with regular work expected to resume on Monday, June 30.The holiday is part of the UAE Cabinet’s approved list of official holidays for 2025, and follows the extended break residents recently enjoyed during the Eid Al Adha holidays earlier in June.The Islamic, or Hijri, New Year, also referred to as Hijri New Year, marks the beginning of the Islamic lunar calendar and falls on the first day of Muharram , the first month in the Hijri calendar. The Hijri calendar is based on lunar months and differs from the Gregorian calendar in both structure and observance.The occasion commemorates the Hijrah, or migration, of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) from Mecca to Medina in the year 622 CE, an event that marks the start of the Islamic calendar. While not typically celebrated on the same scale as Eid Al Fitr or Eid Al Adha, it remains a solemn and significant religious date and is recognized with a public holiday in the UAE.The ministry’s announcement applies to all private sector companies operating within the UAE.Looking ahead, the next Islamic holiday is expected to be Mawlid Al Nabawi, or the Prophet Muhammad’s (PBUH) birthday, which is anticipated to fall on Thursday, September 4, 2025, corresponding to the 12th day of Rabi Al Awwal. As with all Islamic holidays, the exact date will be confirmed by the moon-sighting committee and relevant religious authorities in the UAE.Following that, the UAE National Day holidays will be observed on Tuesday and Wednesday, December 2–3, marking the country’s founding with a two-day mid-week break.Under UAE law, the handling of official holidays is governed by several key provisions:The announcement reaffirms the UAE's structured and transparent approach to managing public holidays across all sectors, allowing residents to plan their personal and professional commitments in advance.","Friday, June 27, 2025, has been declared an official paid holiday for private sector employees in the United Arab Emirates in observance of the Islamic (Hijri) New Year 1447 AH.

In an official announcement, Ajman Municipality stated that it is prohibited for commercial establishments to distribute, display, or sell Zamzam water. The municipality urged the public not to purchase Zamzam from shops under any circumstances.Residents are encouraged to report violations by contacting the designated number: 80070.The ban in Ajman follows an earlier decision by Sharjah Municipality, which also banned all shops from selling Zamzam water. Officials there have signalled strict enforcement, with surprise inspections planned to detect any violations or fraudulent sales, especially given the difficulty in distinguishing Zamzam water from regular bottled water.The measure comes in response to growing concerns over counterfeit Zamzam being sold in local markets.Just weeks prior to the bans, a man in Sharjah was arrested for operating a fraudulent Zamzam water bottling facility out of a residential property. According to Sharjah authorities:Authorities observed vehicles loading bottled water from a house, prompting a raid on the premises. During the raid, officials caught the person inside the premises.Upon inspection, officials discovered that ordinary tank water was being bottled and labelled as Zamzam water. The makeshift facility was found operating under unhygienic conditions, and the water was being sold at a premium price through social media promotions.Authorities seized cartons and plastic bottles falsely labelled as Zamzam. Sharjah Municipality immediately initiated legal and administrative procedures following the incident.Zamzam water is sourced from the Zamzam well, located within the Grand Mosque in Makkah, near the Kaaba. It is revered by Muslims globally as a symbol of purity, sustenance, and healing.Muslims often bring Zamzam water home after performing Hajj or Umrah, and approved channels for distribution in Saudi Arabia include:According to the Ministry of Hajj and Umrah, each pilgrim is allowed to ship one bottle (maximum 5 litres) of Zamzam water free of charge, but it must be packed in designated shipping boxes separate from personal luggage. The bottle must also be sealed and approved for air transport.To access the water, pilgrims are required to present a valid Umrah visa or a permit via the Nusuk app.Both Ajman and Sharjah municipalities have taken a proactive stance, urging the public to be vigilant and avoid purchasing Zamzam water from unauthorised sources. The focus remains on consumer safety, religious respect, and crackdown on fraudulent practices.Authorities emphasize that Zamzam should only be acquired through official Saudi channels, especially given its spiritual significance and susceptibility to forgery.","Zamzam water is sourced from the Zamzam well, located within the Grand Mosque in Makkah, near the Kaaba.

At least 34 Palestinians were killed Monday in shootings near food distribution centres in Gaza, the territory's health ministry said. It was the deadliest such incident so far in a series of near-daily shootings around the aid sites.The food centres are operated by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). Thousands of Palestinians often pass through Israeli military-controlled zones to reach these centres.Witnesses said Israeli troops opened fire early Monday to control crowds at the Rafah centre, one of the busiest aid locations in the south. The Israeli military has not commented on Monday's deaths but previously said its troops fired warning shots at what it calls suspects approaching military positions.Most of the victims were near the GHF centre in Rafah, with a few on roads leading to a newer hub outside Khan Younis, according to officials. Two people trying to get food at the Rafah site told The Associated Press that soldiers fired on the crowd at around 4 am at a nearby traffic circle known as the Flag Roundabout. The area has seen repeated shootings in recent weeks.The military has marked certain routes for people to use to access food, and GHF has warned that straying from them is dangerous.However, many Gazans take the risk in hopes of getting food before supplies run out.Israel and the US say the GHF system helps prevent Hamas from stealing aid, but UN agencies and major aid groups disagree. They say the system is unsafe, cannot meet Gaza's humanitarian needs, and gives Israel too much control over who receives help.Since the centres opened last month, Palestinian officials say dozens have been killed and hundreds injured while trying to access aid. The ongoing war and restrictions on aid delivery have pushed Gaza closer to famine, putting the lives of nearly 2 million people at risk.","It was the deadliest such incident so far in a series of near-daily shootings around the aid sites. Thousands of Palestinians often pass through Israeli military-controlled zones to reach these centres. The ongoing war and restrictions on aid delivery have pushed Gaza closer to famine, putting the lives of nearly 2 million people at risk.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121884873,imgsize-1567342,width-400,resizemode-4/121884873.jpg"

Is Iran violating NPT?

Proposal in initial stages

As Israel continues to target nuclear sites in Iran, Tehran on Monday said that its parliamentarians are preparing a bill that will push it towards exiting the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.According to a report by Reuters, Iran's foreign ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei said, ""In light of recent developments, we will take an appropriate decision. Government has to enforce parliament bills, but such a proposal is just being prepared and we will coordinate in the later stages with parliament.""Meanwhile, he also reiterated Tehran's official stance against developing nuclear weapons.This comes amid escalating tensions between Israel and Iran as both countries continue to launch waves of missiles at each other. The timing of this statement is also crucial, as Israel alleged that Iran is on the verge of building a nuclear bomb.However, Iran denied the allegations, asserting that its nuclear programme is peaceful. Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian echoed that position on Monday, saying nuclear arms violate the country’s core religious principles.But last week, the IAEA said that Iran violated its NPT obligations. Baghaei said the recent Israeli attacks and the IAEA resolution played a direct role in Tehran's strategic reassessment.""Those voting for the resolution prepared the ground for the attack,"" he said.The 1970 treaty restricts signatories from pursuing nuclear weapons in exchange for access to civilian nuclear technology and oversight by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).According to Reuters' report, no decision on quitting the NPR has been made yet, but the proposal is in initial stages of legal process.Meanwhile, Baghaei criticised Israel's own nuclear stance, highlighting that the country is not a signatory to the NPT and is widely believed to possess an undeclared nuclear arsenal. ""The Zionist regime is the only possessor of weapons of mass destruction in the region,"" he said.","Iran says its parliamentarians are preparing a bill that will push it towards exiting the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.

The Israeli Defence Force (IDF) on Monday claimed to have dismantled ""one-third of Iran's missile launchers"" in last night's attack, as tensions between the Jewish state and Tehran continue to peak over uranium enrichment and the possibility that the Khamenei-led nation may soon develop nuclear weapons.The IDF shared footage of attacks on Iranian sites, saying that they dismantled over 20 surface-to-surface Iranian missiles ""minutes before they were to be launched toward Israel’s home front"".""Approx. 100 military targets were struck in Isfahan, central Iran.

The site is critical, providing nearly 70 per cent of Iran’s domestic natural gas supply.The South Pars/North Dome gas field, shared between Iran and Qatar, is considered the largest known natural gas reserve in the world. Iran has been actively developing its portion of the field since the late 1990s.On Saturday, Iranian media reported a ""massive explosion"" and a subsequent fire after an Israeli drone attack targeted facilities at Phase 14 of the South Pars project.Calling the incident ""an extremely dangerous move,"" Araghchi warned that military escalation in the Gulf ""could involve the entire region -- and possibly the whole world.""The attack on South Pars came shortly after Israel’s large-scale offensive on Friday, which struck nuclear sites, military installations, residential areas, and reportedly killed senior Iranian military commanders and nuclear scientists.In retaliation, Iran launched a deadly missile barrage against Israel, killing at least 10 people overnight on Sunday and injuring dozens more.","IDF shared footage of attacks on Iranian sites, saying that they dismantled over 20 surface-to-surface Iranian missiles ""minutes before they were to be launched toward Israel's home front"" Iran's foreign minister Abbas Araghchi accused Israel of trying to widen the scope of the ongoing conflict by targeting a key gas facility along the Gulf coast.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121882968,imgsize-54744,width-400,resizemode-4/121882968.jpg"

Israeli Weapons Censored In Paris As Airstrikes Continue In Gaza And Conflict With Iran Deepens





Israel's Ministry of Defence has condemned the erection of black partition walls around its defence industry pavilions at the Paris Air Show, calling the move ""outrageous and unprecedented"" and demanding an immediate reversal by French authorities and event organisers.The walls appeared overnight ahead of the air show's opening Monday, visually isolating Israeli booths from dozens of other international exhibitors.

Barak Magen makes debut: Israel deploys new air defence system against Iranian strikes — How does it work?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/barak-magen-makes-debut-israel-deploys-new-air-defence-system-against-iranian-strikes-how-does-it-work/articleshow/121880391.cms,"Iran Executes Mossad's Spy, Arrests Two More As War With Israel Rages

What is the Barak Magen defense system?

Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI)

Key capabilities:





Multi-layered protection: Capable of neutralising drones, cruise missiles, sea-skimming missiles, ballistic threats, and even enemy aircraft.





Long-range interception: Utilises the LRAD (Long-Range Active Defense) interceptor missile, which can engage targets at distances exceeding 150 km.





Advanced detection: Integrated with the EL/M-2248 MF-STAR radar, providing 360-degree threat detection and tracking, supported by electro-optical sensors for precision targeting.





Modular architecture: Can be adapted to various platforms, currently deployed on Sa’ar 6-class corvettes, which safeguard Israel’s Exclusive Economic Zone and offshore energy assets.





The Israeli Navy for the first time, successfully west asian countries deployed its Barak Magen air defense system to intercept drones launched from Iran, marking a significant milestone in Israel’s maritime security capabilities amid rising regional tensions.According to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), eight Iranian drones were intercepted overnight by Sa’ar 6-class missile corvettes patrolling Israel's coastal waters. The interception marked the first operational use of the Barak Magen system and its long-range LRAD interceptor, with all threats neutralised before any damage occurred. “The Navy's missile boat flotilla intercepted eight drones launched from Iran,” the IDF said. “This was the first operational use of the 'Barak Magen' air defense system and the long-range interceptor 'LRAD'.”The engagement unfolded amid an escalation in hostilities between Israel and Iran, with the IDF claiming to have intercepted at least 25 drones since the conflict intensified. The use of drone swarms by Iran reflects a broader strategic shift towards low-cost, expendable unmanned systems to probe and challenge Israeli defences.Deployed aboard the Israeli Navy’s newest Sa’ar 6-class corvettes, the Barak Magen system was developed by Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) to counter a wide spectrum of threats — including drones, cruise missiles, and ballistic projectiles — with high precision and rapid response capabilities.Barak Magen is an advanced naval air defense system developed byto defend warships against a variety of aerial threats in complex maritime environments. Its first public use came in June 2025, when it intercepted Iranian drones targeting Israel.Barak Magen was built to address the rising threat of asymmetric aerial attacks, particularly drone swarms and precision munitions launched by adversaries like Iran and its proxies. Unlike land-based systems such as Iron Dome or David’s Sling, Barak Magen is tailored for naval operations, providing rapid-response defense against incoming threats from both air and sea.The system’s debut signals a doctrinal shift in Israeli defence, prioritising maritime air superiority to secure strategic interests at sea. As offshore gas production grows in importance, systems like Barak Magen offer a critical shield for Israel’s economic infrastructure.Its integration with compact yet heavily armed Sa’ar 6-class warships illustrates a modern naval approach — using agile, multi-role vessels equipped with cutting-edge technology to counter increasingly complex threats.","Barak Magen is an advanced naval air defense system developed by Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) Its first public use came in June 2025, when it intercepted Iranian drones targeting Israel.

De-escalation, which could bring oil back below $70 per barrel, with attention shifting back to fundamentals like supply-demand dynamics and trade issues.

Supply Resilience Could Soften Long-Term Impact

Ample storage is available in both the West and China.





Plentiful spare production capacity exists, over 5% of global output, and is now being reintroduced to the market.





Exports outside the Middle East are growing steadily.





Strait of Hormuz: The Critical Chokepoint





The ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran has sent shockwaves through global oil markets, with crude prices surging and concerns rising that UAE fuel prices could follow suit in the coming month. Analysts warn that if the geopolitical tensions continue to escalate, oil prices could breach the $100 mark, and in extreme scenarios, may even reach $120.On Friday morning, Israel conducted a significant military strike in Iran, reportedly targeting nuclear and military facilities. The action is being viewed as a major escalation in the ongoing tensions between the two countries. The incident immediately affected global oil markets, contributing to a sharp rise in crude prices amid concerns over potential disruptions in the region.Following the attack, crude oil prices rose sharply, with prices climbing as much as 14 percent. Over the weekend, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude settled at $72.98 per barrel, and Brent crude closed at $74.23 — an increase of 7.26% and 7.02%, respectively.For UAE motorists, this trend is particularly important. If global oil prices remain elevated, or continue to climb, fuel prices at the pump in the UAE are likely to rise in the coming month. In June, the UAE’s fuel prices were held steady, with:Market analysts and financial experts have expressed concerns that the situation could lead to increased volatility and significantly higher oil prices, depending on how events unfold.Naeem Aslam, an analyst at Zaye Capital, warned, “Markets are staring down a barrel of volatility. Oil’s surged up to 14 per cent on Israel’s strikes; prices could breach $120 if energy infrastructure gets hit. Markets are on edge – any disruption in this oil-rich region could send crude soaring further.”Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, noted that the market's response has already been significant. She explained, “Tensions eventually eased [after Israel's October 2024 strike on Iran], and markets quickly settled. A similar de-escalation is possible now, but not guaranteed. Judging by the price action, the market’s response to last night’s attack has been very strong.”She outlined two possible scenarios:Despite the sharp price spike, some analysts believe the rise could be temporary, as the global oil market remains fundamentally strong in terms of supply and reserves.Norbert Ruecker, head of economics and next-generation research at Julius Baer, said oil remains a reliable indicator of geopolitical tension. “The situation remains in flux, and the coming days and weeks will show how far the escalation goes. Our best guess is that this latest conflict eruption follows the usual pattern, with prices rising temporarily before returning to previous levels,” he said.Ruecker emphasized that the oil market is resilient and less vulnerable than in the past:He added, “Oil supply concerns of course are boiling up and the risk of a closure of the Strait of Hormuz, a key choke point of oil trade, moves into focus.” However, he said such a disruption remains unlikely from Julius Baer’s perspective.The Strait of Hormuz, which handles more than 20 million barrels of crude oil per day, remains the world’s most critical oil transit chokepoint. Any threat to this vital passage can have immediate and far-reaching consequences.Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, warned, “Even a brief disruption of the Strait of Hormuz… could trigger a sharp price spike, with some analysts warning of a potential move toward $100 per barrel in a worst-case scenario.”While the current spike is being interpreted by some as a knee-jerk reaction to military developments, the oil market’s long-term trajectory will depend heavily on how Israel and Iran navigate the conflict in the coming days.","Crude oil prices rose as much as 14 percent following Israel's strike on Iran.

Developed by Rafael Advanced Defence Systems with American support, this defensive shield became operational in 2011 and has proven highly effective, with Israeli military officials reporting an impressive 80-90% success rate.The system employs truck-mounted units that fire radar-guided missiles to neutralise incoming threats in mid-air. One of its notable features is its intelligent threat assessment capability - it can determine whether a rocket is headed toward a populated area and only intercepts those that pose a genuine threat, allowing others to land in unpopulated areas.","Iranian forces unleashed barrage of missiles on Israel early Monday, targeting major cities including Tel Aviv and Haifa.

Review finds UK police and councils covered up ethnicity of grooming gangs for fear of being called racist,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/review-finds-uk-police-and-councils-covered-up-ethnicity-of-grooming-gangs-for-fear-of-being-called-racist/articleshow/121915733.cms,"Representative Image





LONDON: A rapid national audit of grooming gangs ordered by UK PM Keir Starmer in February 2025, following pressure from Elon Musk and published late Monday, has found that UK police and councils deliberately concealed the Asian ethnicity of the perpetrators to avoid “appearing racist” and to avoid “raising community tensions”.In two-thirds of cases of “group-based child sexual exploitation”, no ethnicity was even collected. The audit by Baroness Casey found that a 2020 home office report claiming the majority of predators were white had used flawed data.Casey found that after examining data held by three police forces that did have ethnicity collected, the men of “Asian ethnicity” were “over-represented” as perpetrators of grooming gangs, which warranted further examination.“More often than not, the official reports do not discuss the perpetrators, let alone their ethnicity or any cultural drivers. There is a palpable discomfort in any discussion of ethnicity in most of them. Where ethnicity is mentioned, it is referred to in euphemisms such as ‘the local community’, or it is buried deep in the report,” she wrote.“It is not racist to want to examine the ethnicity of offenders,” she said and, in her report, called for it to be made mandatory for the police to record the ethnicity and nationality of all suspects in grooming gang cases.It was not just white vulnerable girls who are victims, she found. “This audit received representations about the need to examine further cultural and religious drivers behind child sexual exploitation, including concerns that Sikh and Hindu children had been targeted for abuse because they were ‘easy targets’ and who would never tell anyone about being exploited because of the shame,” Casey wrote.She also recommended for the National Crime Agency to take over investigations, for a national inquiry to be ordered, for adults who have penetrative sex with a child under 16 to always be charged with rape, and for govt to commission research into the drivers and cultural factors.In Jan Labour MPs had voted against a national inquiry into grooming gangs and Starmer had described those calling for inquiries as “jumping on a bandwagon of the far-right”.The audit sparked UK Keir Stammer to make a spectacular U-turn and announce a national inquiry at the weekend ahead of the report’s publication. He has agreed to implement all 12 recommendations.The report also found that in current live cases a “significant number” of men running grooming gangs are non-UK nationals and asylum seekers.Home secretary Yvette Cooper announced that henceforth “anyone convicted of sexual offences be excluded from the asylum system and denied refugee status”.","In two-thirds of cases of child sexual exploitation, no ethnicity was even collected.

After years of public outcry, multiple local reviews, and political hesitation, the UK government has announced a full national statutory inquiry into grooming gangs and institutional failures that enabled decades of child sexual exploitation.The decision, announced by Prime Minister Keir Starmer on June 14, marks a dramatic shift in tone for his administration—one that had previously resisted demands for a public investigation into what many see as one of Britain’s worst safeguarding scandals.The tipping point? A perfect storm of political pressure, survivor testimony, community backlash—and unusually, a global spotlight powered by Elon Musk , who used his platform, X (formerly Twitter), to repeatedly target Starmer’s record on grooming gangs.The term “grooming gangs” refers to loosely organised groups of men who exploited underage girls—typically white, working-class, and often in care—in towns across northern England from the early 1990s onwards.The 2014 Jay Report on Rotherham, commissioned after investigative journalism exposed widespread abuse, identified over 1,400 victims between 1997 and 2013. Similar patterns were later uncovered in Rochdale, Telford, Oxford, and Oldham.What made the cases especially sensitive was the ethnic background of many offenders—in several high-profile cases, the perpetrators were men of Pakistani Muslim heritage. However, the official framing used the broader term “Asian grooming gangs”—a euphemism that triggered resentment among British Indians, Sikhs, and East Asians who said their communities were being unfairly implicated.British-Indian communities, especially Hindus and Sikhs, have long objected to the blanket use of the term “Asian grooming gangs.” Their frustration boiled over in January this year when Starmer, in response to criticism from Elon Musk, once again used the phrase during a televised interview.Community leaders issued sharp statements denouncing what they called an ethnic smear. “Why should we be classified as part of these gangs?” asked Jay Shah, spokesperson for Friends of India Society International UK. “Asian means Vietnamese, Sri Lankan, Japanese, Indian, etc. When it comes to grooming gangs, we are Asian. When it comes to Kashmir, we are Indian.”The Hindu Council UK called Starmer’s wording a “whitewash of heinous atrocities,” noting that Hindu and Sikh girls had also been among the victims. Sikh Youth UK, which has documented grooming cases involving Sikh victims for over 15 years, said it had worked with thousands of families and even caught perpetrators outside Sikh schools. The Network of Sikh Organisations described Starmer’s comments as “extremely disappointing” and accused politicians of “protecting perpetrators rather than victims.”Both the Hindu Council UK and INSIGHT UK have since backed Conservative calls for a national inquiry—arguing that political correctness has too often silenced honest debate about ethnicity and crime.The turning point came not from Westminster but from Silicon Valley.In early 2025, Elon Musk—whose X platform has grown into a global political amplifier—began posting repeatedly about grooming gangs. Quoting survivor testimonies, reposting historical reporting, and tagging British officials, Musk accused UK authorities of “turning a blind eye to organised rape” and suggested that political leaders, including Starmer, were “cowards unwilling to confront the truth.”One post from March read: “If these were elite London girls being trafficked, the BBC would talk about nothing else. But poor northern girls? The state looked away.”While the tone of Musk’s commentary sparked debate—especially among British politicians who viewed it as inflammatory—it undeniably brought renewed international attention to the issue.By May, Musk’s X account had posted or amplified over 150 messages about grooming gangs, triggering renewed media coverage, a spike in search interest, and thousands of public responses. Hashtags such as #JusticeForRotherham, #GroomingGangsInquiry, and #StarmerFailedUs trended across the UK and US.The growing visibility added fuel to a debate already brewing in Parliament.In January, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper had quietly commissioned Baroness Louise Casey to conduct a “rapid review” into previous investigations—including Oldham and Rochdale—after persistent claims that public officials downplayed or ignored evidence of abuse.Casey’s report, delivered in May, was damning. It found that multiple public bodies “failed in their duty of care” and that in some cases, victims were dismissed or even blamed. Crucially, it called for a full statutory public inquiry with the ability to compel testimony and evidence.Simultaneously, Conservative MPs, Reform UK leaders, and victim advocacy groups demanded action. Former Home Secretary Suella Braverman, a long-time critic of the “Asian gangs” terminology, stated that Starmer had “run out of excuses.” Reform UK leader Nigel Farage called the lack of a national inquiry “a betrayal of Britain’s daughters.”On June 14, Keir Starmer announced the establishment of a judge-led inquiry under the 2005 Inquiries Act, which gives it full legal powers. He said the investigation would “examine past failures, hold institutions to account, and ensure this can never happen again.”Starmer, who previously served as Director of Public Prosecutions, defended his record, pointing to a rise in grooming-related prosecutions during his tenure. But critics argue that his earlier reluctance to endorse a national inquiry allowed the issue to fester—and exposed Labour to accusations of institutional denial.“There is no more denying the scale of failure,” Starmer said at a press conference. “This inquiry is about justice—for survivors, for their families, and for the country.”Unlike previous reviews—many of which lacked transparency and enforcement—this inquiry has legal teeth. It can:The inquiry will take several months to set up, with hearings likely to begin in early 2026. Its findings could reshape the way Britain handles child protection, race relations, and public accountability. But in the short term, it’s already had an impact:This is not just a story of abuse—it’s a story of institutional failure, political caution, and the new ways power is exercised across borders and platforms. Whether the inquiry delivers justice remains to be seen. But for the thousands of girls whose pain was ignored—and for the communities wrongly smeared along the way—this is a reckoning long overdue.","After years of public outcry, multiple local reviews, and political hesitation, the UK government has announced a full national statutory inquiry into grooming gangs.

UK: Three British Hindus beaten up in London park in racially motivated attack,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-three-british-hindus-beaten-up-in-london-park-in-racially-motivated-attack/articleshow/121840323.cms,"This is an AI-generated image, used for representational purposes only





LONDON: Three British Hindu men were asked their ethnicity in a London park and, when they replied they were Indian and Sri Lankan, were viciously beaten up in an unprovoked attack by three older men who appeared to be Muslim, it has emerged.Two of the men suffered blows to the head and were left unconscious; all had to go to Northwick Park Hospital. They have all been left with cuts and bruises and two have been left with facial fractures. Tory MP Bob Blackman raised the case in the House of Commons on Thursday, describing it as “religious hatred.”TOI has now tracked down the sister of one of the men, a British Indian Gujarati Hindu, aged 20, a first-year university student studying radiography. It turns out he had gone to Harrow Recreation Ground with two friends on May 30 to play cricket. The friends are British Hindus of Sri Lankan descent, aged 20 and 21.The three of them went to a shop at 6 pm, walking past a café where a group of around eight people were seated. It appeared to be a Muslim family, with some of the women wearing hijabs. They looked back at their other friends playing cricket when one of the men outside the café got up and confronted the three Hindus and asked them why they were looking at his family, his sister told TOI.They replied that they were not looking at his family and were looking at friends playing cricket. Then a slightly older man from the café group came over and asked: “What is your problem? Why are you talking to my brother?” The three men tried to defuse the situation and the two men seemed to accept their answer.They went back to the park and sat on a bench.Around 30 minutes later, three men from the cafe group, in their mid to late 20s, came over and became very aggressive, asking, “Where are you from? Are you Sri Lankan? Are you Indian?”To which one of the Sri Lankan-origin men replied: ”Yes, we are.”The three men then beat them up relentlessly, punching and kicking them until the British Indian and his friend were left lying unconscious on the ground, the sister said.“My brother was wearing a sacred thread from a mandir on his wrist,” the sister said.One of the attackers was wearing a Moroccan football T-shirt with the number 2 and the word “Hakimi”.Police and ambulances arrived and the British Indian was taken to the hospital. The other two had to make their own way there.“My brother is struggling. He feels as if people are looking at him and is ashamed to step out of the house. He has never been involved in a fight before,” the sister told TOI on Friday.“He has just done his first-year exams and was meant to resume his two-week clinical placement the week after the attack and that has been put on hold.” She also said she was unhappy with how the police investigation was progressing, as two weeks later, they still had not examined CCTV footage.The Met Police told TOI they were called to deal with a “fight” and one man was taken to hospital “with a head injury”. “There is no evidence at this time that this attack was racially motivated. Our enquiries into the circumstances continue. No arrests have been made,” a spokesperson said.",Three British Hindu men were viciously beaten up in a London park.

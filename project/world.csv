Starting June 30, 2025, residents of the UAE who plan to travel to China must follow a revamped, two-step visa application process that combines an online review with an in-person submission. This new system, launched by the Embassy of the People’s Republic of China in Abu Dhabi and subsequently adopted by the Consulate General in Dubai, aims to simplify the application process, reduce paperwork, and speed up initial reviews, marking a significant shift from the previous, more cumbersome procedure.The key change under the new system is that applicants would no longer have to walk into the Chinese Visa Application Service Centre (CVASC) directly to submit their visa application. Instead, the process begins online:The previous visa application method required applicants to download, print, and manually fill up lengthy PDF forms, often causing confusion and delays. It also involved booking appointments to visit the visa centre, submitting paper documents, and generally longer processing times.The new system offers:The updated application platform caters to several visa categories, each with specific requirements:The Embassy of China in Abu Dhabi launched this digital platform on June 30, 2025, followed by the Dubai consulate on July 14, 2025.

Major rejection: Advocacy group turns down $20 million offer to organize anti-Trump protests; calls it 'ineffective’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/major-rejection-advocacy-group-turns-down-20-million-offer-to-organize-anti-trump-protests-calls-it-ineffective/articleshow/122612611.cms,"Adam Swart (Image: Crowds on Demand official website)





The CEO of an advocacy group revealed that his organization declined an offer reportedly worth around $20 million to help organize a national protest against US President Donald Trump Adam Swart, the founder and CEO of Crowds on Demand, said in an interview on Tuesday that groups associated with the “July 17th Movement” had approached them for support, as reported by Fox News.“Interests aligned with the organizers of the July 17th movement have approached us and, in fact, we rejected an offer that probably is worth around $20 million,” Swart said.The protests, scheduled for Thursday, are being led by Good Trouble Lives On, a group that describes itself as a peaceful, nonviolent protest organization focusing on social change. The group aims to demonstrate against Trump and what it describes as ""the most brazen rollback of civil rights in generations"" on its official website.The date also marks the fifth anniversary of the death of Representative John Lewis, a prominent civil rights activist, who often referred to peaceful protests as creating ""good trouble.""Swart explained that his company which specializes in providing crowds for events and demonstrations declined the offer because they believed the protests would not be impactful.""I mean this is a nationwide thing, right? It’s not to say I would have made 20 million dollars personally, but the value of the contract would have been worth around that amount nationwide to organize huge demonstrations around the country,"" he said.""But personally, I just don’t think it’s effective,"" Swart added. “I’m not trying to seem virtuous by turning it down, I just believe it would be ineffective and make everyone involved look bad.”Responding to reports about the rejected offer, Harrison Fields, special assistant to President Trump and principal deputy press secretary, issued a statement.“President Trump’s America is so successful that blue-haired basement dwellers are paid to stage fake protests against the administration’s remarkable achievements,” Fields said. “Paid agitators should find real jobs instead of selling out for gift cards and meager paychecks that aim to divide the nation and obstruct America’s greatest comeback. Nothing screams a party in disarray more than one that clearly lacks organic support and is forced to astroturf everything. ”Recent incidents involving left-wing protests including violent demonstrations in Los Angeles, where American flags were burned and police officers assaulted, as well as the “No Kings Day” rallies held across the country have come into limelight.","Crowds on Demand CEO Adam Swart revealed that his organization declined an offer reportedly worth around $20 million to help organize a national protest.

‘If a guy like this becomes mayor...’: Vivek Ramaswamy’s hot take on Zohran Mamdani,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/if-a-guy-like-this-becomes-mayor-vivek-ramaswamys-hot-take-on-zohran-mamdani-watch-video/articleshow/122614113.cms,"



Republican leader and ex-DOGE head Vivek Ramaswamy has stepped up his criticism of New York City mayoral contender Zohran Mamdani , warning that the city’s identity could be lost under the “radical left” if Mamdani is elected.Ramaswamy, who is running for governor of Ohio in 2026, claimed that cities like New York are driving away the American spirit — and Ohio could be its next home.""I moved to NYC after I graduated college in 2007 because it was a place that still celebrated success, but that spirit receded in New York & soon could be gone altogether due to Mamdani,” Ramaswamy posted on X. “We’re reviving that American Dream in a new place: Ohio. The revival starts next November.”The 38-year-old former biotech executive, who recently resigned from the Department of Government Efficiency to contest Ohio’s gubernatorial race, has leaned into cultural and ideological differences between blue cities and red states as a core campaign message.Earlier this week, Ramaswamy’s super PAC, Victors Not Victims, funded a giant billboard in Times Square with the message: “Worried About Zohran? Ohio Is Waiting For You!” It contrasted Mamdani, labelled a ""radical socialist"", with Ramaswamy, “protecting freedom”.Critics have focused on Mamdani’s Ugandan-Indian background, however, Ramaswamy issued a public note urging restraint. “The real problem with Mamdani isn’t his race or religion. It’s his anti-capitalist worldview and his policies that risk destroying our nation’s largest city,” he wrote in a New York Post op-ed.In the same article, he revealed how he too had been the subject of ethnic slurs online. “Each time I post a photo, I’m asked to ‘GO HOME’.He warned that if Mamdani were to lead New York, more residents would flee for cities that offer “a better model of American excellence”.Vivek dismissed criminal activity and urged Americans to unite under what he called an ambitious and American spirit. ""But that’s not who we are. The rule of law unites us as Americans. We don’t commit crimes — that’s what unites us.""“The beauty of the United States, is that even if people leave, they can still head to my home state Ohio and celebrate an American spirit, "" he said in a Fox news interview.Ramaswamy’s campaign is widely seen as one of the most well-funded early bids for a 2026 governor’s race, with his PAC already having raised $17 million.",Republican leader and ex-DOGE head Vivek Ramaswamy has stepped up his criticism of New York City mayoral contender Zohran Mamdani.

US: Horrific Blast In Los Angeles: Police Training Facility Rocked, FBI Agents Rush In As 3 Killed





The US justice department on Wednesday fired Maurene Comey, a federal prosecutor in Manhattan and the daughter of former FBI Director James Comey, as reported by the news agency AP.Comey was a veteran lawyer in the US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York. She had worked on several high-profile cases, including the sex trafficking prosecution of financier Jeffrey Epstein and the recent case against rapper Sean “Diddy” Combs.Maurene Comey was considered a highly regarded prosecutor. She successfully helped prosecute Ghislaine Maxwell , Epstein’s former associate, who was convicted for her role in a sex trafficking operation.Earlier this month, she led the trial of Sean “Diddy” Combs, which ended with a split verdict: he was convicted on a prostitution-related charge but acquitted of more serious charges.Recently, Comey has faced criticism from figures within President Trump’s right-wing base. Conservative activist Laura Loomer has urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to remove Comey from her position in May, as reported by Politico.The Trump administration had previously reassigned some justice department lawyers involved in cases perceived as adversarial to the president, and Maurene Comey was considered a potential candidate for such a thing due to her father’s well-known differences with Trump over the past decade.James Comey was serving as FBI director when Donald Trump became president in 2017. He had been appointed to the position by former US President Barack Obama . However, his relationship with Trump was tense from the beginning. During a private dinner, Comey refused a request from Trump to promise personal loyalty.In May 2017, Trump dismissed James Comey while the FBI was investigating possible connections between his presidential campaign and Russia.According to media reports, no specific reason was given for her dismissal. Her firing marks the latest shake-up in the Southern District of New York, which has long been regarded as the most prestigious of the Justice Department’s prosecution offices.","Maurene Comey was a veteran lawyer in the US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York.

Tomorrowland In FLAMES | Main Stage Collapse CAUGHT ON CAM - Fire Sparks Panic & Forest Threat





A major fire on Wednesday (local time) has severely damaged the main stage of world famous Tomorrowland festival in Belgium. This comes just days before its official opening on Friday.In a statement issued Wednesday evening, festival organizers confirmed the incident, “Due to a serious incident and fire on the Tomorrowland Mainstage, our beloved Mainstage has been severely damaged.” They confirmed that no injuries were reported.The fire broke out on Wednesday afternoon, sending thick plumes of black smoke into the sky. Videos circulating online showed fireworks erupting as flames engulfed the structure.Belgium’s public broadcaster VRT reported that the main stage was almost completely destroyed. Emergency services responded swiftly, but the fire was not immediately brought under control.At the time of the fire, no festival-goers were on the site, but approximately 1,000 staff members were present. All have since been safely evacuated.Tomorrowland spokesperson Debby Wilmsen said the destruction was heartbreaking for workers who spent years designing and constructing the stage.Despite the incident, the festival is not being canceled. Organizers confirmed that “DreamVille,” the event’s main campsite, will open on Thursday as planned. “Tomorrow we’re expecting 38,000 festival-goers at DreamVille. We’re really looking forward to it,” Wilmsen said.Wilmsen confirmed that even though the main stage will not be ready in time, the team is working on alternative plans. “We’re going to make it a great festival. It will be without a main stage. But hopefully, we can do something else, but I can’t say much about that yet,” she added.Local residents described the moment the fire broke out. Morgan Hermans, who lives near the site said that she initially heard fireworks and then saw thick smoke. “There was just a big cloud of fireworks and smoke very near us, so that was a bit scary,” she said.“It’s one of the biggest events of the year. Our town is very small, so to welcome people from all over the world is a big deal. Everyone in Boom was a bit terrified for a few seconds,” she added, as reported by CNN.Local police have urged people to avoid the area to allow emergency crews to work. The cause of the fire remains unknown at this time.","Main stage of Tomorrowland festival in Belgium severely damaged by fire.

Awkward Moment At Trump Presser: Rubio Bursts Into Laughter After Reporter's 'Daddy' Question

Marco Rubio : Four hats and rising pressure



Sean Duffy: From roads to rockets



Douglas A. Collins: Veterans and beyond



Ed Martin: Multiple Justice Roles Without Confirmation



Jamieson Greer: Trade and ethics



Keith Sonderling: Labour meets Libraries



Criticism over governance







Several senior officials in US President Donald Trump’s administration are currently holding down more than one top-level role at a time, according to The New York Times.The MAGA supremo's team says this approach is efficient and cost-saving. However, critics warn it’s a recipe for poor management and conflict of interest. As Trump pushes to shrink government in his second term, overlapping appointments have become more common, sparking worries among watchdogs and governance experts alike.US secretary of state Marco Rubio is also serving as interim National Security Adviser, Acting Director of USAID, and Acting Archivist of the National Archives. Critics argue that the workload is overwhelming for a single person, particularly when the roles span such varied and critical domains. Rubio, known for his past presidential run and his time in the Senate, now finds himself managing both foreign diplomacy and national records.Sean Duffy, the transportation secretary, was chosen by Trump to head Nasa after the nomination of Jared Isaacman was withdrawn. Though his experience primarily lies in domestic infrastructure, Duffy has now been asked to lead the country’s space exploration programme.Critics question the match, noting that Nasa’s demands require deep scientific and technical understanding.Douglas A. Collins, the secretary of veterans affairs, has also taken on additional duties, particularly early in Trump’s second term. While his leadership at veterans affairs has focused on improving healthcare and services for former military personnel, NYT reports that he’s been consulted or involved in unrelated agency planning.Ed Martin was denied Senate confirmation as US Attorney for Washington, DC, but that hasn’t stopped the Trump administration from giving him substantial responsibilities. He currently holds three different positions within the Justice Department, none of which require Senate approval. Critics say the administration is avoiding usual rules by giving Martin powerful roles without proper public review.Jamieson Greer has been given the responsibility of serving both as the US Trade Representative and acting head of the Office of Government Ethics. The dual role has raised concerns due to the potential conflict between promoting national trade interests and overseeing ethical standards for federal employees. Greer, a known Trump loyalist, has been instrumental in pushing trade reforms and new tariffs.Keith Sonderling, who heads the Department of Labor, has also been appointed to lead the Institute of Museum and Library Services. The two roles have little in common, with one focused on labour policies and worker rights and the other on supporting public libraries and museums. Many experts have pointed out that managing these separate missions could dilute focus and hinder effectiveness.Experts have voiced strong concerns about this strategy. Max Stier of the Partnership for Public Service described it as “horrible management” that could lead to inefficiency. Pete Piraino, a former ATF agent, said departments like ATF and FEMA require full-time leadership. Others say dual roles could produce conflict of interest, especially when criminal prosecution overlaps with pardon processes or ethical oversight.The White House maintains that these overlapping appointments are cost-effective and ensure loyalty. “President Trump’s cabinet is second to none and has met the moment… harnessing its expertise,” said Harrison Fields, deputy press secretary. Yet critics worry the strategy may weaken governance and create unnecessary confusion within agencies designed to operate independently.",Several senior officials in US President Donald Trump’s administration are currently holding down more than one top-level role at a time.

A dangerous flesh-eating bacteria known as Vibrio vulnificus has killed four people in Florida so far this year, according to the state’s health department. A total of 11 infections have been reported in 2025, news agency New York Post reported.Vibrio vulnificus belongs to a group of Vibrio bacteria typically found in warm, coastal waters. According to the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), this bacteria can enter the body through open wounds when swimming or by consuming raw or undercooked shellfish, especially oysters.Although such infections are rare, they can cause vibriosis, an illness marked by vomiting, diarrhea and stomach pain. The infection can also lead to serious skin infections. Common symptoms include fever, redness, swelling, pain and skin discoloration.While healthy individuals usually experience mild symptoms, those with weak immune systems or chronic liver conditions are at greater risk of severe illness. If the bacteria enters the bloodstream, it can cause septic shock, fever and painful skin blisters. Nearly 50% of such cases are fatal.In rare situation, the bacteria can cause necrotizing fasciitis , a severe condition where flesh around a wound begins to die. This leads to Vibrio vulnificus which in layman terms is often described as a ""flesh-eating bacteria.""There is no evidence of the infection spreading from person to person, according to Florida Health.The infection is diagnosed by testing samples from stool, wounds, or blood. For mild cases, drinking plenty of fluids is advised to prevent dehydration. In more severe cases, surgery may be needed to remove dead tissue, and in extreme situations, amputation might be required.“Aggressive attention should be given to the wound site; for patients with wound infections, amputation of the infected limb is sometimes necessary,” Florida Health stated.According to the CDC, about 1 in 5 patients dies, sometimes within just 24 to 48 hours of falling ill.Health officials advise the public to avoid swimming in warm, brackish waters with open cuts or wounds. It also recommends not to eat raw oysters or shellfish and to prevent cross-contamination of raw seafood with other foods. One must wear protective gloves while handling the raw shellfish.CDC warns that people with conditions like liver disease, diabetes, cancer, HIV or those taking immune-suppressing medications are urged to take extra precautions.In 2024, Florida reported 82 cases and 19 deaths related to Vibrio vulnificus. In 2023, there were 46 cases and 11 deaths.","Vibrio vulnificus belongs to a group of Vibrio bacteria typically found in warm, coastal waters.

1600 protests across US: 'Good Trouble' rallies to target Trump policies; honour civil rights icon John Lewis,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/1600-protests-across-us-good-trouble-rallies-to-target-trump-policies-honour-civil-rights-icon-john-lewis/articleshow/122627826.cms,"Representative Image (AI-generated)

Remembering John Lewis:

Opposition to Trump’s policies:





More than 1,600 protests and events are scheduled across the United States on Thursday in opposition to President Donald Trump ’s controversial policies, including mass deportations and proposed cuts to Medicaid and other support programs for low-income Americans.The events are part of a national day of action titled “Good Trouble Lives On,” held in honour of late Congressman and civil rights icon John Lewis. Demonstrations are expected in streets, courthouses and other public areas. Organisers have urged all participants to remain peaceful, as reported by the Associated Press.“We are navigating one of the most terrifying moments in our nation’s history,” said Lisa Gilbert, co-president of the advocacy group Public Citizen, during a virtual press conference on Tuesday.“We are all grappling with a rise of authoritarianism and lawlessness within our administration ... as the rights, freedoms and expectations of our very democracy are being challenged.”Public Citizen is a nonprofit organization that focuses on challenging corporate power. It is one of the many groups organizing Thursday’s protests.Major demonstrations are planned in Atlanta, St. Louis, Oakland and Annapolis.The rally will be held in Chicago, where participants will gather downtown in the afternoon. The event will include a candlelight vigil honouring John Lewis, along with music and speeches.John Lewis was a longtime US Congressman and a central figure in the civil rights movement. For the first time, he was elected to Congress in 1986. He died in 2020 at the age of 80 following an advanced pancreatic cancer diagnosis.He was the youngest and last surviving member of the Big Six, a group of civil rights leaders led by Martin Luther King Jr. In 1965, at the age of 25, John Lewis led around 600 protesters in the ""Bloody Sunday"" march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama. During the march, he was violently attacked by police and suffered a fractured skull.His actions played a key role in inspiring the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. In 2020, while commemorating the anniversary of the 1965 voting rights marches from Selma to Montgomery, Lewis said, “Get in good trouble, necessary trouble, and redeem the soul of America.”Recent anger against President Trump’s administration has focused on aggressive immigration enforcement. Earlier this month, mass arrests were carried out at two marijuana farms in Southern California. One farmworker died after falling during the operation.The raids came after Trump deployed the National Guard to support federal agents and secure government buildings during enforcement actions in Los Angeles, sparking protests.On June 14, demonstrations known as the “No Kings” protests took place in cities nationwide, from New York to San Francisco. Protesters criticized Trump’s leadership and condemned his decision to celebrate his birthday with a military parade, calling it undemocratic.","More than 1,600 protests and events are scheduled across the United States on Thursday.

No. 7 – Average number of accounts in distress rank



No. 8 – People with accounts in distress rank



No. 13 – Credit score rank and “debt” search interest index rank







While financial hardship affects many across the US, Texas ranks as the number one state struggling the most financially, according to a new WalletHub report.WalletHub conducted a comparison of all 50 US states to identify where residents are experiencing the most financial distress. The analysis considered nine metrics across six key categories, including average credit scores, the percentage of individuals with “accounts in distress” (such as those in forbearance or with deferred payments), the year-over-year change in bankruptcy filings from March 2024, and online search trends for terms like “debt” and “loans. ”Texas, being ranked the most financially distressed state in 2025, may come as a surprise, given that the state boasts a gross domestic product (GDP) larger than that of many countries and continues to have one of the top 10 strongest state economies in the US. Its rank, however, has declined compared to previous years.Despite the state’s strong economy, many Texans are facing serious financial strain in 2025. The study revealed that Texas had the ninth-lowest average credit score in the country in the first quarter of the year.Additionally, the state saw the sixth-largest rise in personal (non-business) bankruptcy filings over the past year, with a 22 percent increase.The report also highlighted that Texas ranked third in the number of accounts per person in forbearance or with deferred payments, and had the seventh-highest percentage of residents with distressed accounts overall, at 7.1 percent.This is the standing of Texas on key indicators of the study, where being first is equivalent to being most distressed.This also pointed to a trend that Texans were frequently searching for terms like “debt” and “loans,” which WalletHub says signals a strong urgency to borrow money, even though many residents are already in debt.Analysing financial stress at the state level is crucial for understanding how Americans are coping with broader economic challenges such as inflation, unemployment, and natural disasters, according to WalletHub analyst Chip Lupo.“When you look at delayed payments alongside factors like bankruptcy rates and shifts in credit scores, it gives a clear view of a state’s overall financial health,” Lupo said.The other end of the list includes states like Hawaii (No. 50), Vermont (No. 49), and Alaska (No.48), as the least financially distressed states in America.The top 10 states with the most people in financial distress in 2025 are:No. 1 – TexasNo. 2 – FloridaNo. 3 – LouisianaNo. 4 – NevadaNo. 5 – South CarolinaNo. 6 – OklahomaNo. 7 – North CarolinaNo. 8 – MississippiNo. 9 – KentuckyNo. 10 – Alabama","WalletHub conducted a comparison of all 50 US states to identify where residents are experiencing the most financial distress.

Poll Do you think President Trump will actually visit Pakistan in September? Yes No





Pakistan anticipates a visit from US President Donald Trump this September, according to reports by two local television channels on Thursday, as reported by Reuters.This would mark the first presidential visit to Pakistan since President George W. Bush's trip in March 2006, spanning a gap of nearly two decades.When approached by Reuters, however, Pakistan's foreign office spokesperson indicated no knowledge of Trump's potential visit.The television channels reported that Trump's itinerary would include stops in both Islamabad and India during his September journey.Pakistan's army chief field Marshal Asim Munir's historic White House lunch with US President Donald Trump on June 18 was followed by American airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities on June 22, causing political backlash in Pakistan. During the meeting, Munir had urged Trump to ease tensions between Iran and Israel.This marked the first instance of a Pakistani military chief being received at the White House while a civilian government was in power in Islamabad. The meeting and subsequent US strikes led to widespread criticism of Pakistan's diplomatic approach.The developments have sparked concerns about America's relationship with Pakistan's military leadership. These concerns were further amplified by statements from Pakistan's defence minister Khawaja Asif to Sky News, where he said Pakistan had done the West's ""dirty work"" for decades, particularly in Afghanistan.The timing of the airstrikes has left Islamabad in a difficult position, as Pakistan had previously expressed vocal support for Tehran.","Pakistan anticipates a visit from US President Donald Trump this September.

Hollywood icon William Shatner has come out in defence of Elon Musk amid an ongoing controversy over a gesture the tech billionaire made during Donald Trump ’s second inauguration.A brief video clip had gone viral after it showed Musk lifting his right arm from chest level in a stiff, straight gesture and saying, “My heart goes out to you.” Critics online slammed the move as a Nazi-style salute, sparking outrage, especially in Germany. The footage was reportedly filmed during a factory tour on January 20, coinciding with Trump’s inauguration ceremony.However, the 'Star Trek' actor, who is also Jewish, dismissed the accusations in a post on X.“I’m a Jew who lived during the time of Nazi Germany in Canada. Do you think that if I believed even for a second that was an homage to Hitler or the Nazis that I would communicate with him; let alone follow him?” Shatner wrote.The comment came in response to a user on X who asked, “You don’t think Elon was doing a Nazi salute?”Musk has repeatedly denied that the gesture was meant as a salute, calling it “media propaganda.” Supporters of the Tesla and SpaceX CEO argue that the video was taken out of context and that the movement was likely just an awkward wave or misunderstood motion.While the Anti-Defamation League also weighed in calling the action “an awkward gesture in a moment of enthusiasm, not a Nazi salute,” critics and historians have warned it could encourage far-right groups.Social media platforms have since been flooded with posts either condemning or mocking the gesture.Shatner and Musk have a history of friendly social media exchanges. The two once joked about Pluto’s status as a planet, with Musk backing Shatner’s campaign to reinstate it. Musk has also expressed admiration for the veteran actor and self-described “Star Trek” fan.Online, Shatner’s blunt defence of Musk has earned him praise from some users, with many calling him “based” for standing by his convictions.","William Shatner has come out in defence of Elon Musk amid an ongoing controversy over a gesture the tech billionaire made during Donald Trump’s second inauguration.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan said on Monday it was creating a national paramilitary force, prompting concern among opposition parties and human rights groups that it could be used as a tool of political repression.The move turns an existing paramilitary force deployed on Pakistan’s northwestern border with Afghanistan into a national security force that will be called the Federal Constabulary, state minister for the interior Talal Chaudhry told a press conference in the eastern city of Faisalabad. Its new duties will include internal security, riot control and counter-terrorism, according to a copy of the amended law reported by the local Dunya News TV.The announcement came after Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party of former jailed PM Imran Khan said it would stage nationwide protests starting on Aug 5, the second anniversary of his arrest. Several such protests since his Aug 2023 arrest have turned violent, in some cases paralysing the capital Islamabad for days.“This will be a new force. This will be a stronger force. We need this force for internal security,” Chaudhry said, adding that President Asif Ali Zardari had already approved amendments in the law introducing changes in the paramilitary force.The new force replaces the Frontier Constabulary (FC), whose cadres were previously recruited only from tribes in the northwestern province, Chaudhry said.Training of the new force will bring it into line with other national law enforcement agencies, he added. Khan’s party spokesperson Zulfikar Bukhari said the changes should be subject to parliamentary discussion.The new force “should not be used as a gimmick to silence political opponents, as has been previously witnessed when the government applied such laws against a large number of the PTI leadership and supporters,” he said. His concern was echoed by Haris Khalique, secretary of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, an independent body. “We are alarmed by the changes being made to the security and law enforcement structure of the country without any debate in parliament,” Khalique said.REUTERS","The move turns an existing paramilitary force deployed on Pakistan’s northwestern border with Afghanistan into a national security force.

Poliovirus found in 20 Pakistani districts amid rising vaccine refusals: New sewage data signals resurgence; 13th polio case confirmed in 2025,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/poliovirus-found-in-20-pakistani-districts-amid-rising-vaccine-refusals-new-sewage-data-signals-resurgence-13th-polio-case-confirmed-in-2025/articleshow/122421011.cms,"



Pakistan's battle against polio has hit a fresh setback, with the deadly virus detected in sewage samples across 20 districts, including the capital, just as the country grapples with rising vaccine refusal rates.According to ARY News, citing the National Reference Laboratory, 28 sewage samples collected between May 8 and June 17 tested positive for Wild Poliovirus Type 1 (WPV1). The presence of the virus was confirmed in major urban centres such as Lahore, Karachi, and Islamabad, as well as in districts across Sindh, Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir.Sindh reported the highest contamination, with 14 positive samples from 10 districts. Lahore recorded three cases, while Islamabad and four districts in KP also registered positive samples. In Balochistan, the virus was found in Mastung, Khuzdar, and Sibi. Mirpur in PoJK also showed signs of the virus.This alarming development follows Pakistan’s second national polio vaccination drive earlier this year, which saw over 60,000 refusals, 39,000 of them in Karachi alone. These refusals, officials say, are now posing a major roadblock to the country’s eradication efforts.“We’re not just fighting a virus; we’re battling misinformation and mistrust,” a senior health official told ARY News.Pakistan remains one of only two countries where polio is still endemic, the other being Afghanistan. With the confirmation of another new case this week, the total number of polio cases in the country has reached 13 so far in 2025.Health experts warn that the virus spreads primarily through contaminated water or food and can cause paralysis or death. There is no cure for polio, making vaccination the only defense. The World Health Organisation emphasises that multiple oral doses are needed to protect children under five, the group most vulnerable to the disease.Despite ongoing national campaigns, large pockets in southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa remain difficult to access for vaccination teams, leaving thousands of children at risk.As the virus resurfaces in urban and rural sewers alike, officials say the next phase in Pakistan’s anti-polio war must tackle both the virus, and vaccine hesitancy, with equal urgency.","Sindh reported the highest contamination, with 14 positive samples from 10 districts.

So far, Pakistan has received two instalments under the programme, with the government implementing agreed policy measures aimed at fiscal discipline and investor confidence.“Early policy measures have helped restore macroeconomic stability and rebuild investor confidence, despite persistent external challenges,” Binici noted.He stressed the importance of structural reforms to ensure long-term economic sustainability, including strengthening tax equity, improving the business climate, and encouraging private-sector-led investment.Binici also welcomed Pakistan’s commitment to climate-related reforms under the $1.3 billion Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF), approved in March.The RSF supports projects focused on disaster preparedness, efficient water use, green investments, and better climate data transparency.“Support through the RSF will not only strengthen Pakistan’s climate resilience but also help unlock green investments and foster a more climate-conscious economic trajectory,” he said.On regional prospects, Binici said economic growth in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, including Pakistan, was expected to improve in 2025 and beyond. However, he warned that global economic uncertainty remains high due to trade tensions, geopolitical fragmentation, and weakening cooperation.","Pakistan's economic performance under IMF's $7 billion loan programme has been'strong so far' Mahir Binici, the IMF’s Resident Representative for Pakistan, spoke at a lecture in Islamabad.

Karachi blackout protest chokes city traffic: Punjab Colony residents block roads after 24-hour outage; report points to systemic collapse,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/karachi-blackout-protest-chokes-city-traffic-punjab-colony-residents-block-roads-after-24-hour-outage-report-points-to-systemic-collapse/articleshow/122418234.cms,"



A protest over a prolonged power outage in Karachi’s Punjab Colony spiraled into city-wide traffic chaos on Saturday, underscoring what many see as chronic governance failure and energy mismanagement in Pakistan, Dawn reported.Residents of an 80-flat, 10-storey building blocked a major road near Punjab Chowrangi after going more than 24 hours without electricity. Power had reportedly been out since 11 am Friday, and despite repeated complaints, K-Electric, Karachi’s sole power distributor, allegedly failed to respond.The resulting sit-in crippled traffic on Defence Road and nearby areas. Long queues of trucks and tankers vital to Karachi Port were stalled from Qayyumabad to the KPT Flyover. Major intersections like Boat Basin, Gizri, and Hino Chowrangi were brought to a standstill, leaving thousands of commuters stranded, according to Dawn.The outage reportedly followed K-Electric’s anti-theft operation in the adjacent P&T Colony. Protesters claimed legal connections were also cut off in the sweep, with no clear procedure followed. KE, however, described the protestors as ""miscreants"" attempting to restore illegal connections and said their teams were attacked during the operation, allegedly linked to a cable TV network.No evidence was provided implicating all affected residents in theft.While KE later claimed to have restored power to parts of the area, the larger issue remains unresolved. The incident highlights Pakistan’s ongoing struggle to provide reliable electricity, exacerbated by outdated infrastructure and lack of accountability in power distribution.As Dawn noted, the crisis is less about one blackout and more a reflection of systemic dysfunction, where citizens bear the brunt of institutional failure.","Residents of an 80-flat, 10-storey building blocked a major road near Punjab Chowrangi after going more than 24 hours without electricity.

India Lost 1 Rafale Jet During Op Sindoor, But Pakistan Did Not Do It: Dassault CEO's Fresh Claim

Poll Should passengers receive more training on recognizing flight details? Yes, it’s important No, it's the airline's job





In a major goof-up, a Pakistani airline flew a passenger to Jeddah in Saudi Arabia instead of Karachi, his actual destination.Shahzain, the affected passenger, alleged that he was not informed that he had boarded the wrong flight despite showing his ticket to the air hostess, ARY News reported.The passenger had to travel from Lahore, Pakistan's second-largest city, to Karachi, the largest.According to Shahzain, two planes were parked at Lahore airport's domestic terminal gate, and he was not aware of the mistake until it was too late.He has now sent a legal notice to the carrier, accusing it of causing him distress by its negligence.He demanded that the airline cover the additional travel expenses he incurred. He also sought compensation for the inconvenience and trouble he faced.Additionally, Shahzain confirmed he did not have a passport or visa for international travel.Two hours into the flight, I questioned why the plane had not yet reached Karachi.

PESHAWAR: An under-construction government primary school for girls in Pakistan's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province was damaged in an IED blast by unknown militants, police said on Friday.No casualties were reported as the building was unoccupied at the time of the explosion.Militants had planted an explosive material inside the premises of the Azaan Javed Primary School in Baka Khel police jurisdiction of Bannu district.The device was detonated with a powerful blast, causing substantial structural damage to the building.An FIR has been registered and forensic teams have been deployed to collect evidence from the blast site, police said.Authorities have condemned the attack as an attempt to derail educational development in the region.According to a report by the Lowy Institute, an Australian think tank, more than 1,100 girls' schools have been destroyed in the tribal areas between 2007 to 2017, with teachers and young students also targeted.Before an all-out military operation launched by Pakistan's security forces in 2014, the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) carried out hundreds of attacks on girls' schools in the tribal areas and settled districts of the northwestern province from its stronghold in Swat district.After the crackdown, TTP militants fled to Afghanistan and began to orchestrate cross border attacks from their new sanctuaries.The Taliban takeover of Kabul has emboldened the TTP, which is fighting to regain control of its strongholds in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.Since the takeover of Afghanistan in 2021, the Taliban has banned girls from attending school beyond the sixth grade and banned women from universities.Pakistani Taliban, who are ideologically closer to Afghan Taliban, are trying to enforce a similar anti-education and theocratic agenda in Pakistan's tribal areas by force.The youngest Nobel Prize laureate, Malala Yousafzai, who is from Swat district, was shot in the face when she was 14 by TTP gunmen in 2012 as she wanted to pursue her education.","Militants planted an explosive material inside the premises of the Azaan Javed Primary School.

In a disturbing case, Pakistani actress and model Humaira Asghar Ali was found dead in her Karachi apartment, with forensic experts saying she likely died between eight to ten months ago.Her body was discovered last week by a police team executing a court order to vacate the flat.According to Geo News, which cited the initial post-mortem findings, the body was in an “advanced stage of decomposition.” Facial muscles had deteriorated, fingers and nails were reduced to bone, and large parts of the body had no muscle tissue left. The bones reportedly began to fall apart when touched.Humaira had acted in several television serials and two films. She lived alone in an apartment in the upscale Defence Housing Society.The report also said that her internal organs had turned into a “black-coloured mass” and brain matter was entirely decomposed due to autolysis. Cartilage in the joints was gone, though no bone fractures were found. While the head and spine remained intact, the spinal cord was missing. Brown-coloured insects were reportedly present, especially in the hair, but no maggots were found.Because of the severe state of decay, experts were unable to determine the exact cause of death at this stage. However, DNA profiling and toxicology tests are underway and are expected to offer further insight.Initially, police said that her family refused to take the body. “Her family members have flatly refused to own her or take the body for burial,” DIG South Zone Asad Reza said, adding they claimed to have severed all ties with her two years ago. He said the case posed unusual challenges, especially since her death had gone unnoticed for such a long time and no neighbours appeared to have raised any concerns.Geo News later confirmed that her family received the remains on Thursday and transported them to Lahore by ambulance.","Pakistani actress and model Humaira Asghar Ali was found dead in her Karachi apartment.

Nine people were shot dead by rebels in Pakistan’s Balochistan province late Thursday after they were pulled off passenger buses. The victims were targeted based on their identity cards showing Punjab origins, as per reports.According to Dawn, two buses travelling from Quetta to Punjab were intercepted near Sur-Dakai along the Loralai-Zhob highway. Armed men reportedly blocked the road, boarded the vehicles, and began checking passengers’ CNICs.Those identified as residents of Punjab were taken off at gunpoint and later killed. “The terrorists forced the two passenger buses to stop on a highway and pulled nine passengers out. They took them in an area nearby and killed all of them,” said local official Naveed Alam, speaking to AFP.District administrator Saadat Hussain confirmed that the bodies were later recovered from the roadside. “The forces found the dead bodies all belong to different areas of Punjab,” he told AFP.“The terrorists must have taken the passengers’ identification documents with them,” AC Alam told Dawn.While no group initially claimed responsibility, the Balochistan Liberation Front (BLA) later took credit. The group has waged a long-running insurgency against the Pakistani state, frequently targeting non-Baloch civilians and military personnel.The Baloch insurgency, which seeks independence from Islamabad, has intensified in recent years despite claims by Pakistani authorities that it is under control. President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the killings, blaming “terrorists from the outlawed BLA” for seeking to destabilise the country.The killings echo a similar attack last year in which 23 passengers were killed. Human rights groups and separatists have accused Pakistan’s security forces of brutal counter-insurgency tactics, including enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings.","Nine people were shot dead by rebels in Pakistan’s Balochistan province.

As the party’s central leaders arrived for the rally, they were reportedly attacked by Awami League leaders and workers. The situation quickly escalated into a full-blown clash involving the police and army, who used live ammunition and tear gas to disperse the crowds.The violence began around noon local time and continued until the evening. Awami League members allegedly vandalised the rally venue, setting fire to the stage and audience chairs. The area turned into a virtual battlefield, with live television footage showing tear gas clouds and sounds of gunfire and explosions.NCP leaders were eventually taken into protective custody by police.A curfew was imposed in Gopalganj from 8 pm Wednesday until 6 pm the next day to restore order.Rumors had spread the night before that the NCP planned to demolish the mausoleum of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the founding father of Bangladesh, further fueling tensions.

DHAKA: In yet another development showcasing growing social intolerance in Bangladesh, the ancestral home of iconic filmmaker Satyajit Ray in Dhaka is being demolished to make way for a new semi-concrete structure, the local media reported Tuesday.Located on Horikishore Ray Chowdhury Road in the city, the century-old house was home to Upendrakishore Ray Chowdhury. Upendrakishore, a prominent 19th-century litterateur in his own right besides being a painter and publisher, was the father of celebrated poet Sukumar Ray and grandfather of filmmaker Satyajit Ray.A semi-concrete structure with several rooms will be built to house a Shishu Academy at the historically-significant building, the country's leading media outlet 'Daily Star' reported. According to reports, the property - which was built by Upendrakishore more than a century ago and previously housed the Mymensingh Shishu Academy - fell into a state of disrepair after years of neglect by the authorities.The newspaper said that local residents have expressed their concerns over the decision, citing that the demolition will wipe out the legacy of the Ray dynasty in Mymensingh city. However, the authorities insist that the demolition is being carried out in accordance with proper procedures and ""necessary approvals"".Officials from Dhaka's Department of Archeology, while agreeing that the property remains an archeological heritage, admitted that their repeated requests to protect the building have gone unheard.Expressing her anguish, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee posted on X: ""The Ray family is one of the most prominent torchbearers of Bengal's culture. Upendrakishore was among the pillars of the Bengal Renaissance. I feel this house is inextricably linked to Bengal's cultural history.

PHNOM PENH: Cambodia's military will begin conscripting civilians next year, Prime Minister Hun Manet said Monday, citing rising tensions with Thailand as the reason for activating a long-dormant mandatory enlistment law.Cambodia's parliament in 2006 approved a law that would require all Cambodians aged 18 to 30 to serve in the military for 18 months, although it has never been enforced.Relations with neighbouring Thailand have been tense since May, when a long-standing territorial dispute boiled over into cross-border clashes, killing one Cambodian soldier.""This episode of confrontation is a lesson for us and is an opportunity for us to review, assess, and set our targets to reform our military,"" Hun Manet said.""From 2026, the military conscription law will be implemented,"" he told a ceremony at the Royal Gendarmerie Training Centre in central Kampong Chhnang province.Hun Manet said the service period would be extended from the 18 months outlined in the legislation passed two decades ago to 24 months, and pledged to ""look at increasing"" Cambodia's defence budget.""Our national defence, the building of our military, is not to invade anybody's territory but it is to protect our territory,"" he added.The Cambodian soldier was killed by Thai troops in a firefight in a disputed area known as the Emerald Triangle, where the borders of both countries and Laos meet.The incident soured relations between Phnom Penh and Bangkok -- causing the closure of border crossings as Cambodia banned fuel and gas imports from Thailand.It also caused a domestic political crisis in Thailand, where Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra has been suspended from office pending an ethics probe over her conduct during the row.A diplomatic call between Paeotongtarn and Hun Manet's father, former leader Hun Sen, was leaked from the Cambodian side, sparking a judicial investigation.Neighbouring Thailand already has military conscription for young and able-bodied men, who enter a lottery to determine whether they have to serve.","Cambodia's parliament in 2006 approved a law that would require all Cambodians aged 18 to 30 to serve in the military for 18 months.

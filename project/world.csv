Trump Sends First Big Message To Elon Musk After Explosive Clash; 'For Now, I Won't Be...' | Watch

Poll Should lawmakers prioritize future industries over traditional ones in legislation? Absolutely, future industries are crucial No, traditional industries need support too

Musk vs Big Beautiful Bill







Former Doge chief and Tesla CEO Elon Musk on Saturday reinforced his criticism of US President Donald Trump's Big Beautiful Bill, warning that the legislation, pushed urgently by Republican senators, would destroy millions of jobs in America and cause harm to the country.Calling the bill ""Utterly insane and destructive,"" in a post on X, Musk said that this will severely damage the industries of the future.""The latest Senate draft bill will destroy millions of jobs in America and cause immense strategic harm to our country! Utterly insane and destructive. It gives handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future,"" he said.The Senate was holding a key test vote on ""big, beautiful bill"" Saturday evening, June 28. According to the CBS news, Trump has pressured Congress to pass the bill. In a statement, obtained by CBS News on Saturday, the White House said that a failure to pass the bill would be the ""ultimate betrayal.""""The One Big Beautiful Bill Act reflects the shared priorities of both the Congress and the Administration.

WIDE RAMIFICATIONS BEYOND BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP:

Trump Dragged To Court By 22 U.S. States: Order Ending Birthright Citizenship Sparks Furore

THE BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP EO:

THE SPECIFIC FALL OUT:

SUMMING UP:





In a 6-3 decision, the US Supreme Court (SC) made a partial ruling on President Trump's executive order (EO) regarding birthright citizenship. Deciding on the procedural issue, the SC held that judges of federal district courts cannot issue nationwide injunctions to block a government policy (The birthright citizenship-EO, in this case). It is important to note that the SC did not decide whether the EO itself is constitutional or not – this issue is still being examined by the federal district courts.The order, which has upended decades of precedent and curtailed federal courts’ power to issue injunctions, is seen as having wide-reaching, onerous ramifications, which would not be restricted to just the issue of birthright-citizenship. Jath Shao, immigration attorney, explained, “This would potentially mean that every affected party would have to file a lawsuit on their own, and not benefit from being similarly situated. This may also mean that activists have to fight in multiple jurisdictions, and can't just win nationwide relief in one federal courtroom anymore.”Todd Schulte, President at FWD.us said, “Moreover, we are deeply concerned this will create new incentives for an administration to press ahead on unlawful, harmful actions by placing a new, substantial burden on any harmed individuals, for whom seeking relief and justice will now be more challenging.”Abhinav Tripathi, immigration attorney and founder of Protego Law Group, said, “This decision to limit nationwide injunctions is a major shift in how unlawful federal policies can be challenged. While class actions remain available, they are no substitute, especially in urgent immigration matters where delay can mean detention, deportation, or family separation. Class certification takes time, often excludes many affected, and lacks the immediacy that nationwide injunctions once provided. This ruling in short, fragments relief, weakens judicial oversight, and concentrates power in the executive, undermining due process and equal protection at a structural level.”Greg Siskind, co-founder of Siskind Susser, an immigration law firm, viewed that federal courts could be brought to a screeching halt as thousands of separate lawsuits are filed. And now ordinary people will need to file suits to protect their constitutional rights, no matter how many courts say a policy is unconstitutional.Jeff Joseph, President, American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA), said, “In a 6-3 decision, the SC has limited the ability for district judges to grant universal relief in cases where the government is facially violating the Constitution in ways that have implications for the entire country. Now, plaintiffs will have to go through the burdensome process of establishing a nationwide class of similarly situated individuals and then seek a nationwide injunction. Or cases will have to be filed on an individual and piecemeal basis, resulting in chaos in the courts. By requiring piecemeal suits and protection in this manner, the Court is setting American families up for failure. For example, if a young scientist, here on an H-1B visa, who is working and contributing to our economy, gives birth, she would need to join a class action suit or sue individually to try to fight for her child’s constitutionally guaranteed right. This is impractical and will result in clogging up the courts on an issue that facially violates the Constitution and should not even be under question. The Constitution is clear—birthright citizenship is guaranteed under the 14th Amendment. Once again, the rule of law is the loser today with this decision.”According to the EO, US citizenship is denied to children born in the United States if they are not born to at least one biological parent who is a US citizen or green card holder. Thus, if the mother is in the US lawfully but temporarily (eg: as a visitor or on a non-immigrant visa – be it a dependent visa like H-4 or even a work visa) and the father is not a green card holder or US citizen, the child even if born in the US will not get automatic American citizenship.TOI had analysed the EO. Read also: Citizenship by birth curtailed even for legal immigrants; over 1 million Indians in green card queue impacted Previously, three different lower courts (federal district courts) had issued orders that stopped this EO from being put into effect across the entire country. These were the district courts of Maryland, the Western District of Washington and Massachusetts.The Supreme Court's new ruling means these original court orders will now only protect the specific individuals, organisations, and states that filed the lawsuits against the executive order. The 22 protected states are: Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin, plus Washington D.C. and San Francisco. For everyone else not involved in those lawsuits, the government will be allowed to start implementing the executive order in 30 days.According to Cyrus D. Mehta, founder of a NY-based immigration law firm, “The order means that the practice of extending citizenship to the US-born children of undocumented immigrants and some temporary residents and visitors would end in the 28 states that have not challenged the measure. The only way out is to file a class action. Or each person would have to make an individual constitutional challenge.”Rajiv Khanna, managing attorney at Immigraiton.com said, “The injunctions blocking the policy remain in effect for 30 days, giving time for new legal strategies. The reality check: This creates a complex patchwork. The policy remains blocked in the 22 states that sued, but could theoretically be implemented elsewhere, though the practical challenges of selective enforcement are enormous.”Charles Kuck, an immigration attorney, was aghast. He posted on a social media platform, “Anyone who wants to challenge Trump's illegal executive order on birthright citizenship (it's illegal because there is a federal law on this), has to sue INDIVIDUALLY to secure their child's citizenship. A truly moronic decision. (The court did NOT rule on the legality of Trump's order, just the process to challenge it).” ""Nearly 3,50,000 lawsuits a year to verify citizenship, that is what the Supreme Court ordered. Nice work for lawyers. Terrible for America!"", he quipped.David Leopold, an Ohio based immigration attorney, on a social media platform, pointed out the dissenting voice of Justice Sotomayor, who said, “Newborns subject to the Citizenship order will face the gravest harms imaginable. If the order does in fact go into effect without further intervention by the district courts, children will lose, at least for the time being, 'a most precious right,' and 'cherished status' that 'carries with it the privilege of full participation in the affairs of our society. The order will cause chaos for families of all affected children, too, as expecting parents scramble to understand whether the order will apply to them and what ramifications that will have.”Indeed, the ramifications could be gut-wrenching as newborns could face deportation even as their parents remain lawfully in the country (eg: those on temporary work visas).Bhumireddy Sai Srinivas Reddy, a high court advocate in India and an Indiana based legal consultant raised some important issues. “While the SC has allowed the executive order to take effect after 30 days, it hasn’t provided a clear framework for how it should be enforced or challenged. This opens the door to a troubling scenario — what happens if different federal courts issue conflicting rulings? For instance, if the Southern District of Indiana blocks the order but the Northern District allows it, does that mean a child born in one district qualifies as a US citizen, while another child, born just a few miles away, does not?”“This could lead to a situation where families might be forced to seek jurisdictions with favorable court rulings to secure citizenship for their children. It also raises the question of whether citizenship will now depend on the location of the hospital where the child is born or the legal residence of the parents,” he added.“The SC’s ruling today undermines equal justice under the law. The Court’s decision means that constitutional protections now depend on which state you live in or whether you can afford to file a lawsuit,” was a statement given by Senator Alex Padilla, Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Immigration Subcommittee.“Today’s decision emboldens President Trump’s unconstitutional attack on birthright citizenship, designed to stoke fear and persecute immigrant communities. It also fails every American who looks to the court to serve as a check to ensure that the executive branch follows the law. The SC is supposed to serve as a safeguard against presidential overreach, not incentivize it. We must heed Justice Jackson’s warning that today’s decision will permit the Executive to violate the Constitution with respect to anyone who has not yet sued,” added the statement.Ben Johnson , AILA’s executive Director, summed up: “Rather than try to defend an obviously unconstitutional executive order directly, the Trump administration manipulated the legal process to avoid swift judicial review, delaying justice for those affected and setting the stage for confusion and chaos. And today, the SC played along.”“ Instead of stepping in to declare this EO unconstitutional, the SC has greenlit a prolonged and punishing legal battle across the country. We are now facing the prospect of hundreds of individual lawsuits and likely multiple class actions to protect a right that is plainly guaranteed by the Constitution. It’s a shameful dereliction of duty. By refusing to allow federal judges to block an executive action that clearly violates the Constitution, the SC is forcing millions of individuals affected by this Executive Order to bear the full burden of seeking justice on their own. This not only imposes an enormous cost—financially and emotionally—on those families, but it also squanders government resources litigating the same issue over and over again. Birthright citizenship is not ambiguous, nor is it a vague legal question; it is a cornerstone of American democracy enshrined in the Constitution. This decision fails us all, fails the courts, and fails our Constitution,” said Johnson.","In a 6-3 decision, the US Supreme Court (SC) made a partial ruling on President Trump's executive order (EO) regarding birthright citizenship. Deciding on the procedural issue, the SC held that judges of federal district courts cannot issue nationwide injunctions to block a government policy.

It also gives Democrats a chance to gain ground in the 2026 midterm elections. Tillis could now play an unpredictable role in the Republican Party, where few members go against Trump.

Trump also claimed the senator did not do enough to help people in North Carolina after Hurricane Helene caused major flooding.""Tillis is a talker and complainer, NOT A DOER,"" Trump wrote.Tillis gained attention in North Carolina politics when he left his job as an IBM consultant during his second term in the state House. He led the GOP’s efforts to win more seats in the 2010 elections.

US sanctions on Turkey's defence sector over its purchase of a Russian air defence system are likely to be ended by the year's end, the US envoy to Ankara said Sunday.Speaking to state news agency Anadolu, Tom Barrack said US President Donald Trump and his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan would instruct their top diplomats to ""figure out the way and end it and Congress will support an intelligent solution"".With both sides committed to drawing a line under the dispute, which has dragged on for five years, the issue could be resolved within six months, Barrack said.""My belief is that by the year end, we have the possibility of having a solution, my belief is they're going to solve the problem,"" he said.Washington imposed sanctions on Ankara in 2020 over its purchase of an S-400 Russian surface-to-air missile defence system under a 2017 law known as CAATSA, which aims to limit Russia's military influence.It also booted Turkey out of its F-35 programme, with Washington saying the presence of the S-400 would allow the Russians to collect information on the stealth jet's capabilities -- a move that further soured ties between the NATO allies.""All these things that have been discussed for five years, F-35s, F-16s, S400s, sanctions, tariffs... Enough. We have to put that aside, and Congress is willing to take a fresh look at it,"" Barrack said.In March, Erdogan spoke to Trump about the need to finalise a deal to let Turkey buy US F-16 fighter planes and be readmitted to the development programme for F-35 warplanes.And last month, he said he saw an end in sight to the sanctions, saying Turkey had seen them eased under Trump.On Tuesday, Erdogan met Trump on the sidelines of a NATO summit in The Hague and called for increased defence industry cooperation with Washington, which he said could significantly boost trade between them.""Advancing cooperation in the defence industry would facilitate achieving the goal of a $100 billion trade volume,"" he said.Turkey, which wants to modernise its air force, has also been seeking to buy 40 Eurofighter Typhoons built by a four-nation consortium of Germany, Britain, Spain and Italy.","US sanctions on Turkey's defence sector over its purchase of a Russian air defence system are likely to be ended by the year's end, the US envoy to Ankara says.

Washington: US President Donald Trump said he is not planning to extend a 90-day pause on tariffs on most nations beyond July 9, when the negotiating period he set would expire, and his administration will notify countries that the trade penalties will take effect unless there are deals with the United States.""I don't think I'll need to,"" he said in an interview on Fox News's Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo that was taped Friday.

MINGORA, SWAT: Torrential rain triggered flash floods that tore through Pakistan’s northwestern Swat Valley over the weekend, killing at least 32 people and laying bare gaps in disaster preparedness in a region once ravaged by Taliban.Twelve members of one family were swept away while picnicking along the river in Swat, witnesses said. Phone videos showed relatives clinging to rocks, screaming for help as waters surged around them. “We kept dialling the emergency numbers, but no one came. By the time they did, it was too late… we were pulling out bodies,” local vendor Kabeer said.The family had travelled from Mardan and remained trapped for over an hour with no rescue teams arriving. “This valley has lived through terrorists, military operations, and devastating floods. Every time, we’re promised lessons will be learned, but nothing ever really changes,” said Khan Sher, a resident of Mingora, recalling Taliban control before the 2009 army offensive and the devastation of the 2010 floods.Heavy rain pounded Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab, and Balochistan, causing widespread destruction. “Flash floods caught us off-guard in Swat.We’ve retrieved 16 bodies so far from the river. Rescue operations are ongoing,” a rescue official said.Swat, now a bustling tourist hub, largely escaped the catastrophic 2022 floods that killed over 1,700 nationwide. This time, towns like Bahrain and Kalam, packed with riverside hotels, had little buffer when waters surged. Entire stretches transformed into danger zones within minutes.Pakistan has championed climate justice on global stages, yet its domestic disaster response remains stretched thin. “Each year we mourn our dead, patch up the roads, and brace for the next disaster,” said Liaquat Bacha, a farmer whose fields were washed away.","Torrential rain triggered flash floods that tore through Pakistan’s northwestern Swat Valley over the weekend.

At least 45 people have been killed across Pakistan as heavy rain and flash floods battered multiple regions since the start of the monsoon season, disaster management officials said on Sunday.

The Swat Valley alone accounted for 14 deaths, where local media reported that a flash flood swept away families gathered near a riverbank.In Punjab, Pakistan’s most populous province located along the Indian border, 13 people have died since Wednesday. Officials said eight of them were children, killed when walls or roofs collapsed during intense rainfall. The remaining victims were caught in sudden floods.Another 11 fatalities have been reported in Sindh and Balochistan, further highlighting the widespread impact of the seasonal downpour.The Pakistan Meteorological Department has warned that heavy rainfall and the risk of flash floods will persist until at least Saturday, urging residents in vulnerable areas to take precautions.This latest tragedy follows a string of extreme weather events in Pakistan.

Another earthquake struck Pakistan on Sunday morning, with 4.5 magnitude, said the National Center for Seismology (NCS). This is the second quake that hit the nation in the same dayThe quake occurred at a shallow depth of 10 kilometers, which makes it prone to aftershocks and can cause stronger ground shaking.The NCS shared the details in a post on X, “EQ of M: 4.5, On: 29/06/2025 08:02:51 IST, Lat: 30.24 N, Long: 69.86 E, Depth: 10 Km, Location: Pakistan.”There were no immediate reports of injuries or major damage.

It occurred at a depth of 150 kilometers.Prior to these two events, another earthquake measuring 4.4 on the Richter scale hit the region on June 15. Like Sunday’s later tremor, it was also shallow, recorded at a depth of 10 kilometers.Shallow earthquakes tend to be more dangerous than deeper ones because their seismic waves have less distance to travel before reaching the surface. This leads to stronger ground shaking, which can cause greater structural damage and increase the risk of casualties.Pakistan is among the most seismically active nations in the world, as it is crisscrossed by several major fault lines. As a result, earthquakes occur frequently and are often severe.Geologically, Pakistan sits at the intersection of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates. The provinces of Balochistan, the federally administered tribal areas, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Gilgit-Baltistan lie along the southern edge of the Eurasian plate, while Sindh, Punjab, and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir are located on the northwestern edge of the Indian plate.The ongoing collision between these plates makes the region highly susceptible to powerful earthquakes.","The quake occurred at a shallow depth of 10 kilometers, which makes it prone to aftershocks and can cause stronger ground shaking.

Heart-wrenching footage has emerged showing several people stranded on a narrow elevated strip in the middle of Pakistan's Swat River, moments before a deadly flash flood swept them away on Friday morning.The video, which went viral across social media platforms, captures their desperate cries for help as torrents of water surge around them.At least nine people from a single extended family lost their lives in the tragedy, according to Geo TV.The victims, including children, had gathered near the riverbank for breakfast while on a leisure trip from Sialkot. According to officials, the group was unaware of the sudden rise in water levels caused by heavy rains upstream.“They were taking selfies, and there wasn’t much water at the time,” said a family member, as quoted by news agency Reuters. “Suddenly, a massive wave came and swept them all away”, the member added.As per Swat deputy commissioner Shehzad Mehboob, 17 individuals were caught in the floodwaters. “We have recovered nine bodies so far and rescued four people alive. The search for the remaining four is ongoing,” he was quoted as saying by Geo News.Among the dead were women and children. Residents said it took over two hours for rescue teams to arrive at the scene.The devastating moment prompted an outpouring of grief in Sialkot, where the bodies of seven victims were received by wailing family members. “My children were calling for help in front of my eyes. We couldn’t save them,” said a distraught relative.The Pakistan Army has since joined local rescue teams, while the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government has ordered a high-level inquiry to investigate the lapses. The committee has been given seven days to submit its report and recommend preventive measures.According to Reuters, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority has warned of continued heavy rains and potential flash floods across northern Pakistan until next week.Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed sorrow over the tragedy, calling it a “painful reminder” of nature’s fury and urging tourists to follow safety advisories, as cited by Reuters.Heavy rains have affected parts of Pakistan since earlier this week, blocking highways and damaging homes.However, weather forecasters predict that the country will experience less rainfall compared to 2022, when climate-induced downpours caused rivers to swell and flooded one-third of Pakistan, resulting in 1,739 fatalities.","At least nine people from a single extended family lost their lives in the tragedy.

The statement came during a call with Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif amid high tensions in the Middle East.“Secretary Rubio emphasised Iran can never develop or acquire a nuclear weapon,” said US State Department Spokesperson Tammy Bruce.According to Bruce, both leaders “acknowledged the importance of working together to promote a durable peace between Israel and Iran and maintaining regional stability.”The message to Islamabad comes at a sensitive time, as the country has historically tried to balance its ties with both Iran and the West. Rubio’s call comes just days after a major US military strike on Iran’s underground nuclear facilities.The strikes triggered political controversy in Islamabad which had just days earlier recommended US President Donald Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize.The nomination, signed by deputy Prime Minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar, praised Trump’s role in easing tensions with India. However, criticism erupted after Islamabad condemned the strikes as a breach of international law.JUI-F leader Maulana Fazlur Rehman demanded the nomination be withdrawn, calling Trump’s peace claims “false” and accusing him of backing Israeli aggression. Opposition figures, including Mushahid Hussain, slammed Trump for starting an “illegal war” and urged the government to revoke the nomination.PTI’s Raoof Hasan said the move brought “shame and embarrassment”, while other leaders, including Maleeha Lodhi and Afrasiab Khattak, labelled it undiplomatic and misguided.Pakistan’s foreign ministry issued a statement defending Iran’s right to self-defence under the UN Charter and warned of regional destabilisation. The backlash reflects a rapid shift from recent praise of Trump’s diplomacy.On June 22, the United States launched airstrikes targeting Iran’s nuclear infrastructure. Three critical sites — Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan — were struck using 30,000-pound GBU-57 “bunker buster” bombs, delivered by stealth B-2 bombers.On President Donald Trump’s orders, US Central Command carried out what the Pentagon described as a “deliberate and precise strike” to “severely degrade Iran’s nuclear weapons infrastructure.”“At approximately 6:40 PM EST, 2:10 am Iran time, the lead B-2 dropped GBU-57 MOP weapons on the first of several aim points at Fordow,” said General Dan Caine, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.The military operation followed Israel’s “Operation Rising Lion” on June 13 and Iran’s retaliatory “Operation True Promise 3.”","US Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a firm warning to Pakistan on Friday, saying that Iran must never be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons.

A Pakistan military officer who had claimed to have captured Indian Air Force pilot Abhinandan Varthaman was killed in a clash with Taliban militants in the Sararogha area of South Waziristan, near the Afghan border.According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), Major Syed Moiz Abbas Shah was killed along with Lance Naik Jibran Ullah during an operation against Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) fighters.ISPR added that the Pakistan Army killed 11 TTP militants and wounded seven others in the same operation.Major Moiz’s funeral prayers were held at Chaklala Garrison in Rawalpindi, with Pakistan Army Chief General Asim Munir in attendance.“Major Syed Moiz Abbas fought bravely in the face of resistance and ultimately laid down his life in the line of duty, upholding the highest traditions of bravery, sacrifice, and patriotism,” the ISPR statement quoted Munir as saying.His body was flown to his hometown of Chakwal in Punjab, where he was laid to rest with full military honours.A resurfaced clip of his old interview with Geo TV, now circulating on social media, shows Moiz — then a captain — detailing the events surrounding the capture of Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman.Varthaman had shot down a Pakistani F-16 fighter in February 2019 before his MiG-21 was hit and he was captured. He was held in Pakistan for three days before being released.The TTP, also known as the Pakistan Taliban, was formed in 2007 as an umbrella group of several militant outfits. Its primary aim is to impose a strict interpretation of Islamic law across Pakistan.Believed to have close ties with al-Qaeda, the TTP has been blamed for numerous deadly attacks in Pakistan, including the 2009 assault on army headquarters, attacks on military bases, and the 2008 bombing of the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad.Pakistan has described the TTP as “Fitna al-Khawarij,” referencing a historical Islamic sect known for violent rebellion.",Major Syed Moiz Abbas Shah was killed along with Lance Naik Jibran Ullah during an operation against Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) fighters.

FATF Report Reveals Pakistan’s Missile Programme Link to 2020 Cargo Seized in India

What is ICBM?

Change in US strategy?





Another growing concern stems from Pakistan. US intelligence agencies have assessed that Pakistan is actively developing an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of reaching the continental United States.According to a report by, the Pakistani military is pursuing a nuclear-armed ICBM, particularly in the wake of Operation Sindoor that took place in May.While Islamabad maintains that its nuclear program is aimed solely at deterring India—its conventionally superior neighbor—US intelligence agencies have assessed that Pakistan is actively developing an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of reaching the continental United States.By pursuing such long-range capabilities, Pakistan may be attempting to deter potential US actions—whether a preemptive strike on its nuclear facilities or intervention in a future conflict with India.ICBM is a long-range missile with a reach exceeding 5,500 kilometers (3,400 miles), primarily designed to deliver nuclear payloads—typically one or more thermonuclear warheads. While ICBMs are theoretically capable of carrying conventional, chemical, or biological weapons, such payloads have never been operationally deployed on these systems.Modern ICBMs often feature multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs), enabling a single missile to deliver several warheads to different targets simultaneously.Countries currently known to possess operational ICBMs include the United States, Russia, China, France, the United Kingdom, India, Israel, and North Korea. Pakistan, despite being a nuclear-armed nation, remained the only such state without an ICBM capability.Advancements in missile technology, such as those seen in second- and third-generation systems like the US LGM-118 Peacekeeper, significantly increased accuracy, allowing ICBMs to hit even small, fortified targets with high reliability.ICBMs stand apart from other ballistic missile classes due to their extended range and faster speed. They surpass intermediate-range ballistic missiles (IRBMs), medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs), short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs), and tactical ballistic missiles in both capability and strategic impact.US officials have pointed out, the acquisition of ICBMs capable of targeting American territory would compel Washington to categorize Pakistan as a nuclear threat. Historically, no nation with such reach has been treated as an ally by the United States. In effect, the threat of nuclear escalation now shadows every region central to US strategic interests.While each emerging nuclear adversary—Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran—poses a significant threat on its own, the prospect of coordination or strategic collusion among them presents a far more alarming challenge.","According to a report by, the Pakistani military is pursuing a nuclear-armed ICBM.

Former Pakistan foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari issued a blunt warning Monday to India over its unilateral suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), saying Pakistan would not hesitate to respond if its water rights were violated. Speaking during the budget session of National Assembly, the Pakistan Peoples Party chairman said, “India has two options: share water fairly, or we will take it from all six rivers. ” He described India’s move to suspend the 1960 treaty after the terrorist attack in Pahalgam as both illegal and provocative.Bilawal argued there is no clause allowing unilateral withdrawal. “India’s claim that the treaty is in abeyance has no legal basis. According to the UN Charter, cutting off water is a form of aggression,” he said. He warned that if India pursued this course, it could lead to open conflict.“We do not want war, but if water is used as a weapon... Pakistan will be forced to act — and we are in a position to defeat India just as we have before,” he said.Bilawal urged India to resume dialogue, particularly on counterterrorism coordination. “Without engagement, violence will increase in both countries,” he warned, adding Pakistan’s own fight against terrorism had been undermined by Indian attempts to “politicise the issue”.","Bilawal Bhutto Zardari says Pakistan would not hesitate to respond if its water rights were violated.

An earthquake of magnitude 4.2 on the Richter scale jolted Nepal on Sunday, according to a statement released by the National Center for Seismology (NCS).The statement noted that the earthquake is susceptible to aftershocks, as it occurred at a shallow depth of 10 km.In a post on X, the NCS said: ""EQ of M: 4.2, On: 29/06/2025 14:19:05 IST, Lat: 29.35 N, Long: 81.94 E, Depth: 10 Km, Location: Nepal.""Shallow earthquakes, such as the one that struck Nepal on Sunday, are typically more dangerous than deeper ones. In such cases, tremors are felt much closer to the Earth's surface, increasing the potential for widespread damage to life and property. In contrast, tremors from deeper earthquakes tend to lose intensity before reaching the surface.Nepal has a long history of seismic activity, with the devastating 2015 earthquake, which claimed thousands of lives, still fresh in public memory. The country lies in the Himalayan region, a zone of intense seismic activity, caused by the ongoing collision between the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates.This collision leads to the Indian plate sliding beneath the Eurasian plate, a process known as subduction, which builds up immense pressure and stress within the Earth’s crust.The subduction zone amplifies this stress, making Nepal particularly vulnerable to earthquakes.The ongoing tectonic collision also contributes to the uplift of the Himalayan mountain range, further adding to seismic activity in the region.Earlier on April 26, a minute of silence was observed in memory of the 8,969 victims who lost their lives during the deadly 2015 earthquake in Nepal. Nepali Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli stood beneath the replica of the Dharahara Tower, which collapsed during the 7.8-magnitude earthquake a decade ago, and paid tribute to those who perished in the disaster.","An earthquake of magnitude 4.2 on the Richter scale jolted Nepal on Sunday.

NEW DELHI: The Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) condemned the alleged abduction and forced religious conversion of four Hindu siblings in Pakistan's Sindh province, calling it a “horrible story” and denouncing the continued rise in anti-Hindu violence in the region. The incident, where three sisters and their cousin were allegedly coerced into converting to Islam by their teachers, has reignited concerns over minority rights in Pakistan.“It is a horrible story,” said VHP national spokesperson Vinod Bansal. “Conversion and atrocities are increasing. International bodies like the UNHRC, the UNO, and other concerned agencies remain silent when Hindus face violence at the hands of Islamic jihadis. Pakistan must honour the Nehru-Liaquat Pact to safeguard minorities and take immediate action. The religion that claims to preach peace is being exposed by such incidents, not only in Pakistan but also in Bangladesh. The world knows that the land now called Bangladesh was once the sacred land of Maa Durga. Today, not only are chants to the goddess banned, but devotees are being attacked and idols desecrated. This must stop.”The VHP’s remarks come in the wake of alarming reports from Shahdadpur, Sindh, where four Hindu siblings, two of them minors, were allegedly abducted and converted by their teachers. Despite protests by families and Hindu community leaders, local media portrayed the conversions as voluntary. Pakistani courts ruled that the minors be returned to their families, while the two adult girls, both medical students, were sent to a safe house. The accused, who are teachers, were granted bail after kidnapping charges were dropped, fuelling further outrage.In a separate incident, a Durga temple in Bangladesh was reportedly demolished and devotees assaulted during recent religious gatherings. Hindu organisations have linked this to an increasing pattern of targeted violence and state indifference in both Pakistan and Bangladesh. The VHP warned that Bangladesh is moving in the direction of Pakistan and Afghanistan in terms of intolerance, describing the trend as “serious and condemnable. ”Bansal added that while the Government of India has taken diplomatic steps, the lack of serious international response remains troubling. He also criticised sections of India’s opposition and Muslim organisations for remaining silent on such incidents, questioning their “credibility and partiality against Hindus.”","The Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) condemned the alleged abduction and forced religious conversion of four Hindu siblings in Pakistan's Sindh province.

Rapper Bobby Vylan of UK punk-rap duo Bob Vylan triggered a major controversy following his Glastonbury Festival performance Friday as he led the crowd to chants of “Free, free Palestine” and “Death, death to the IDF. ” The incident has prompted backlash from government officials, the Israeli embassy, and festival organizers, while Avon and Somerset Police have launched an official investigation into possible hate speech or incitement.The chant was broadcast live on BBC iPlayer, prompting widespread criticism from the broadcaster. The BBC later issued a warning for “strong and discriminatory language” and confirmed the performance would not be made available for streaming on demand.Emily Eavis, Glastonbury’s co-organizer, distanced the festival from the remarks, and said the organizers do not condone the chants. “These comments very much crossed a line. There is absolutely no place at Glastonbury for hate speech.” Festival organizers reiterated their stance against antisemitism and violence, adding that they were reviewing internal processes following the incident.The Embassy of Israel in the UK issued a statement noting that it is deeply disturbed by the inflammatory and hateful rhetoric.""Freedom of expression is a cornerstone of democracy. But when speech crosses into incitement, hatred, and advocacy of ethnic cleansing, it must be called out—especially when amplified by public figures on prominent platforms,"" it said.""Chants such as “Death to the IDF,” and “From the river to the sea” are slogans that advocate for the dismantling of the State of Israel and implicitly call for the elimination of Jewish self-determination. When such messages are delivered before tens of thousands of festivalgoers and met with applause, it raises serious concerns about the normalisation of extremist language and the glorification of violence,"" the statement added.UK culture secretary Lisa Nandy demanded an explanation from BBC Director-General Tim Davie, calling the broadcast “deeply irresponsible.” Health Secretary Wes Streeting described the chants as “a disgrace.” The Campaign Against Antisemitism announced it would file a formal complaint with the BBC, accusing the network of amplifying an extremist narrative.Avon and Somerset Police confirmed they are reviewing footage from the performance and assessing whether criminal charges may be appropriate under laws governing incitement and hate speech. “We are aware of footage circulating online and are assessing whether any offences have been committed,” a spokesperson said.","Rapper Bobby Vylan of UK punk-rap duo Bob Vylan triggered a major controversy following his Glastonbury Festival performance Friday. He led the crowd to chants of “Free, free Palestine” and “Death, death to the IDF ” The incident has prompted backlash from government officials, the Israeli embassy, and festival organizers.

UK government condemns 'death to the IDF' chants at Glastonbury,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-government-condemns-death-to-the-idf-chants-at-glastonbury/articleshow/122141529.cms,"'A joke'







GLASTONBURY: The UK government said on Sunday that the BBC had questions to answer over criticism of Israel by musicians at the Glastonbury festival that police are probing.UK officers are studying videos of rapper Bobby Vylan leading crowds in chants of ""Death, death to the IDF"", a reference to the acronym for the Israeli army, during his set on Saturday.They are also examining comments by outspoken Irish rap trio Kneecap, one of whose members wore a T-shirt dedicated to Palestine Action Group, which is about to be banned under UK terror laws.The IDF chants, condemned by the Israeli embassy in London, were broadcast on the BBC, which airs coverage of Britain's most popular music festival.""I thought it's appalling, to be honest, and I think the BBC and Glastonbury have got questions to answer about how we saw such a spectacle on our screens,"" UK minister Wes Streeting told Sky News.The Israel embassy said in a statement late Saturday ""it was ""deeply disturbed by the inflammatory and hateful rhetoric expressed on stage at the Glastonbury Festival"".But Streeting, Labour's health secretary, also took aim at the embassy, telling it to ""get your own house in order"".""I think there's a serious point there by the Israeli embassy. I wish they'd take the violence of their own citizens towards Palestinians more seriously,"" he said, citing settler violence in the West Bank.A spokesperson for the BBC said some of the comments by Vylan, part of British duo Bob Vylan, were ""deeply offensive"" and the broadcaster had ""no plans to make the performance available on demand"".Avon and Somerset police said Saturday that video evidence would be assessed by officers ""to determine whether any offences may have been committed that would require a criminal investigation"".Kneecap, who have made headlines in recent months with their pro-Palestinian and anti-Israel stance, led crowds in a chant against UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer.Starmer had said the band should not perform after its member Liam O'Hanna, known by his stage name Mo Chara, was charged with a terror offence.He appeared in court earlier this month accused of having displayed a Hezbollah flag while saying ""Up Hamas, Up Hezbollah"" after a video resurfaced of a London concert last year.The Iran-backed Lebanese force Hezbollah and the Palestinian militant group Hamas are banned in the UK, and it is an offence to express support for them.O'Hanna has denied the charge and told the Guardian in an interview published Friday that ""it was a joke -- we're playing characters"".Kneecap regularly lead crowds in chants of ""Free Palestine"" during their concerts. Their fans revere them for their anti-establishment stance and criticism of British imperialism but critics call them extremists.The group apologised this year after a 2023 video emerged appearing to show one singer calling for the death of British Conservative lawmakers.","UK police are studying videos of rapper Bobby Vylan leading crowds in chants of ""Death, death to the IDF"" They are also examining comments by outspoken Irish rap trio Kneecap, one of whose members wore a T-shirt dedicated to Palestine Action Group.

Mayor Eric Adams expressed interest in raising campaign donations from Turkish businessmen during a 2022 dinner, newly unsealed court documents in his dismissed corruption case have revealed.According to filings cited by the New York Post, Adams “welcomed the offer of foreign contributions” and directed a promoter to coordinate with one of his staffers to secure the funds for his 2025 re-election bid The revelations are part of a trove of 1,785 pages of court documents made public after a legal push by multiple media outlets. The documents detail the FBI’s wide-ranging investigation into Adams and offer insight into the evidence federal prosecutors were gathering before the case was abruptly dismissed in April.As per New York Post, the newly unsealed records show Adams attended the January 2022 dinner with two staffers, where the idea of a visit to Turkey to meet potential donors was discussed.The filing notes Adams encouraged further coordination to arrange the contributions, though the documents do not confirm whether the trip ever took place or any donations were received.The same set of filings also contains allegations that Adams misled federal investigators about the location of his personal cellphone, which was seized during a raid on Gracie Mansion in September 2024.The FBI recovered multiple devices from his residence, including two iPads, a second iPhone, and an Iridium satellite phone on his nightstand.In a sworn affidavit, an FBI agent accused the mayor of “evidence of consciousness of guilt,” alleging he intentionally hid his phone and made false statements because he feared the device could reveal evidence of other crimes. Adams reportedly told his lawyer he had forgotten the phone’s passcode and provided an incorrect one.The original five-count indictment against Adams, unsealed last September, accused him of accepting over $100,000 in undisclosed gifts and luxury travel in exchange for political favours. Prosecutors also alleged he pressured the FDNY to approve permits for the Turkish consulate building in Manhattan despite safety concerns.Adams was accused of using straw donor schemes to tap into millions in matching campaign funds, reported CBS News.Though Adams has denied all wrongdoing, the case led to significant fallout. Four deputy mayors and several federal prosecutors resigned following the controversial dismissal request, which Judge Dale Ho criticised as a political bargain, citing alleged concessions over immigration policy.Ho ultimately ruled the case would not return to court, describing the DOJ’s motion to dismiss as “smacking of a bargain” and saying it wasn’t fair to let the matter hang over the mayor during an election year.Despite the scandal, Adams met with US President Trump at the White House Friday to discuss what he called “key priorities” for New York City, even as questions around his conduct continue to linger.",New York Mayor Eric Adams was accused of accepting gifts and travel in exchange for political favours.

The Trump administration is considering cutting the steep 145% tariff on Chinese imports by more than half, possibly as early as next week, as US and Chinese officials gear up for high-level trade talks in Switzerland,reported, citing sources close to the negotiations.US officials are reportedly weighing a reduction of the levy to somewhere between 50% and 54%, a move aimed at easing tensions as trade negotiations unfold. The proposed cut, according to, would be accompanied by a separate plan to lower tariffs on imports from neighbouring South Asian countries to 25%.“They are going to be bringing it down to 50% while the negotiations are ongoing,” a source was quoted as saying byUS President Trump hinted at the potential tariff shift during a meeting with UK officials in the Oval Office, stating, “It’s at 145 so we know it’s coming down,” while expressing optimism over US-China ties. “I think we’re going to have a very good relationship,” he added. Retail industry leaders , including Walmart’s Doug McMillon, Target’s Brian Cornell, and Home Depot’s Ted Decker, reportedly urged Trump to consider easing the tariff burden during an April 21 meeting at the White House.Though the executives described the session as “productive” and “constructive,” no specific outcomes were disclosed.Retailers have since started preparing for a range of tariff outcomes. Jay Foreman, CEO of toy company Basic Fun, was quoted bythat many are now asking vendors to quote prices based on tariffs between 10% and 54% to ensure flexibility.He added that a 54% levy would still push prices up significantly, such as a Tonka truck jumping from $29.99 to $49.99 but that’s “workable.” A 145% tariff, however, would push the price to nearly $80, which he warned would “bring sales to a virtual standstill.”Nick Mowbray, CEO of toy brand Zuru, said “the speculation is 54%,” but noted that it has “definitely not been told explicitly to retail yet.”Meanwhile, White House dismissed the tariff rollback talk as speculation, reported the news agency. “When decisions on tariffs are made, they will come directly from the President. Anything else is just pure speculation,” said a White House spokesperson.Still, retail executives say treasury secretary Scott Bessent’s recent remarks at the Milken Institute Global Conference, that the current rate “isn’t sustainable”, gave them confidence that a shift is imminent.Lawrence Rosen, chairman of Cra-Z-Art, confirmed tothat retailers are hearing similar figures, “We are hearing China at 50% to 54% and other Asian countries at 25%.”Foreman revealed that Basic Fun has seven containers en route to the US under the 145% rate and plans to store them to avoid the costly levy. The rest remain in warehouses, awaiting green light.Noel Hacegaba, COO at the Port of Long Beach, said hopes are high the Switzerland talks will help “de-escalate growing trade tensions,” but stressed that shippers need “a strong signal” before adjusting supply routes.Retail expert Gerald Storch, former CEO of Toys R Us, toldthat since the White House meeting, retailers seem “less panicked” and have slightly “relaxed” their urgency for domestic sourcing.While the situation remains fluid, the toy industry, with 80% of US toy sales coming from China and broader retail sector are closely watching for any official word from Trump in the coming days.","The Trump administration is considering cutting the steep 145% tariff on Chinese imports by more than half, possibly as early as next week.

Kash Patel cancels FBI morning meetings as he's mostly late: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kash-patel-cancels-fbi-morning-meetings-as-hes-mostly-late-report/articleshow/121041513.cms,"Kash Patel has been accused of changing decades-old schedule of FBI directors.

Badmouthing campaign against Patel



Kash Patel says he wants more budget, withdraws demand







FBI directors, for decades, have been holding a morning meeting daily at 8.30 am. But Kash Patel takes the meeting two days a week as 'sometimes he failed to arrive on time', an NBC News report said, citing officials who worked on Kash Patel's schedule. FBI spokesperson Ben Williamson denied that there was a change in the schedule because Patel was late. He said Patel still attends five morning meetings each week, including three that are smaller than the usual director's brief.FBI directors used to hold a teleconference with the leaders of the field officers on Wednesdays. Patel has discontinued that over leaking attempts but he's in close touch with the leaders.Kash Patel is facing a volley of attacks over his office timing, his trips, his frequent presence at sporting events -- of late. A former FBI official recently commented on MSNBC's Morning Joe that Patel is spotted more at nightclubs than in the office. The statement had to be retracted by MSNBC which said it did not verify the statement.Williamson said he meets Kash Patel every day in the office and hence the allegations that Patel is not in the office and working remotely from his home in Las Vegas were bogus.A friend of Patel told NBC that the only thing that Patel is doing late into the night is going to the gym.Countering allegations that Patel is not serious about the job, one FBI official told NBC that these are not even remotely true. “I myself am with him in many of these meetings. He asks tons of questions and pushes staff to get to the point and present solutions,” said the official. “To a bad-faith individual who loves to bloviate and gossip to NBC News, that might come off as lack of interest. It’s not. It’s being efficient with time and wanting to fix problems. ”Kash Patel asked for more money from the government for his agency -- $1 billion more than what the White House said.This raised speculations whether staunch Trump-supporter Patel was showing independence but a day later, he told senators that he agreed with the White House budget and will make it work.","Kash Patel is facing a volley of attacks over his office timing, his trips, his frequent presence at sporting events -- of late.

Batey won (NYT photo)





Walking into the crowded hotel conference room, Andrew Batey looked like any other tech guy attending ETHDenver, an annual cryptocurrency conference. A venture capital investor based in Florida, Batey, however, was at the conference not to network but to fight one of them - live on YouTube. At the hotel, a short drive from the conference convention center, under the watchful eye of a representative from the Colorado Combative Sports Commission, Batey, 40, stripped down to his boxers.He weighed in at just under 195 pounds, on target for the fight. The bare-chested venture capitalist raised his biceps and flexed for cameras.America's tech elite, not content with unfathomable wealth and rising political influence in Washington, have recently developed a new obsession - fighting. Across the United States, men like Batey are learning to punch, kick, knee, elbow and, in some cases, hammer an opponent over the head with their fists. The figurehead of the movement is Mark Zuckerberg, the billionaire CEO of Meta , who has charted his impressive physical transformation from skinny computer nerd to martial arts fighter on Instagram, one of the apps he owns.The tech industry's newfound devotion to martial arts is one facet of a broader cultural shift that has upended US politics. Many of these tech founders-turned-fighters are chasing a testosterone-heavy ideal of masculinity that is ascendant on social media and embraced by President Donald Trump. An enthusiastic practitioner of Brazilian jujitsu, Zuckerberg, 40, lamented this year that corporate culture was getting ""neutered"" and was devoid of ""masculine energy."" In 2023, Zuckerberg's fellow billionaire Elon Musk, a longtime corporate rival, challenged him to a televised cage match. But that fight never took place.Most of the tech world's aspiring fighters have a crucial thing in common: Before they started pursuing their extravagant new hobby, they made a lot of money.In 2018, Batey founded Beatdapp, a company that develops software to eliminate fraud in music streaming. He also runs a venture capital firm, Side Door Ventures, that invests in crypto startups.Two years ago, Batey's venture fund invested $500,000 in Karate Combat , a would-be competitor to the Ultimate Fighting Championship. The league operates as a hybrid between an athletic competition and a tech startup. Rather than offering traditional shares, Karate Combat gave Batey's firm Karate tokens - a cryptocurrency that fans can wager on Karate Combat fights, which stream on YouTube as well as TV channels like ESPN Deportes. Karate Combat's primary business is professional fighting - mixed martial arts contests featuring seasoned athletes, some of whom also fight in UFC. (A representative for Karate Combat declined to reveal how much money the league generates.)Last year, the company created a new competition for amateurs and started offering it as the undercard at pro events, which are sometimes held at crypto conferences. The competition was called Influencer Fight Club , and its premise was simple: Put a couple of tech guys in the ring and see what happens.Over the past 18 months, the competition has featured some big names in the crypto world, including Nic Carter, a venture investor known for his combative posts on the social site X. At a crypto conference in Nashville, Tennessee, last summer, Carter, boasting an impressive physique, knocked out a tattooed crypto marketer in one round. On social media, he was hailed as ""kingly"" and adopted the nickname ""Tungsten Daddy.

Trump: Maybe the Children Will Have Two Dolls Instead of 30 Dolls | WSJ News





US president Donald Trump has threatened a steep 100% tariff on Mattel, the maker of Barbie dolls, after the company said it would continue producing toys overseas despite plans to reduce reliance on Chinese imports.Speaking from the Oval Office last week Trump responded sharply to Mattel’s recent decision to maintain offshore production. “I've heard Mattel said, 'Well, we're going to go counter, we're going to try going someplace else. Let him go,” he said of Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz. “We’ll put a 100% tariff on his toys, and he won’t sell one toy in the United States, and that's their biggest market.”Mattel recently announced a “pricing action” in its US business, blaming changes in global trade policy and tariffs.During its first-quarter earnings call, Kreiz explained that the firm was moving away from China as a manufacturing hub, but not bringing operations back to the US. He cited cost-efficiency and productivity in other countries as reasons for keeping production abroad.Toymakers are increasingly worried about the effects of Trump’s trade policy. With roughly 80% of global toy production based in China, industry leaders have urged the administration to exempt toys from tariffs.The Toy Association warned of serious disruptions and higher prices.Trump, however, brushed off those concerns, saying that girls don’t need many dolls. During an interview he said, ""I don't think that a beautiful baby girl needs—that's 11 years old—needs to have 30 dolls. I think they can have three dolls or four dolls because what we were doing with China was just unbelievable. We had a trade deficit of hundreds of billions of dollars with China.""Reacting to the price hikes and similar moves by carmaker Ford, Trump said, “I think they’re just saying that to negotiate deals with me.”","Mattel recently announced a ‘pricing action’ in its US business, blaming changes in global trade policy and tariffs.

Donald Trump claims credit for brokering ceasefire as drone continue to buzz,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-claims-credit-for-brokering-ceasefire-as-drone-continue-to-buzz/articleshow/121064213.cms,"TOI correspondent from Washington:





US President Donald Trump announced a ""full and immediate ceasefire"" between India and Pakistan arising from what he claimed was ""a long night of talks mediated by the United States,"" even as drone attacks appeared to continue at the border in what is at best a sketchy truce.""Congratulations to both Countries on using Common Sense and Great Intelligence. Thank you for your attention to this matter!"" Trump posted on social media on Saturday night after announcing a ceasefire that New Delhi alleged was violated by Pakistan almost immediately.The purported ceasefire came after parleys initiated by Secretary of State Marco Rubio , who phoned key principals in Pakistan, including its army chief Asif Munir, its President Shahbaz Sharif , and its foreign minister Ishaq Dar, asking them to stand down before reaching out to his counterparts S.Jaishankar and Ajit Doval in New Delhi to do the same.Rubio also announced that the ""Governments of India and Pakistan have agreed to an immediate ceasefire and to start talks on a broad set of issues at a neutral site.""""We commend Prime Ministers Modi and Sharif on their wisdom, prudence, and statesmanship in choosing the path of peace,"" he added.On the ground though, the guns -- or at least the drones -- did not fall silent, with India accusing Pakistan of violating the ceasefire even as it was announced with a drone attack on Srinagar confirmed by Omar Abdullah.""This is no ceasefire. The air defence units in the middle of Srinagar just opened up,"" he posted on X, even as arguments erupted in studios and social media about which country reached out to the US first or which country the US pressed to stand down and who folded first.""Folks are going to get very hung up on whether the U.S. ""mediated"" an India-Pakistan ceasefire, or just helped bridge the gap and encourage the two to talk...I don't think it matters much. India was compelled to send a message after Pahalgam and that message was sent,"" said Jeff Smith, a Heritage Foundation analyst and an expert on the region.""Terror will not be cost-free and future terror attacks will be met with a military response. The fact the guns have gone silent for now is a good thing,"" Smith added, hewing to the broad reading among regional experts that India had set new red lines in how it would respond to terrorist attacks.Soon after the ceasefire announcement by US, India's EAM S Jaishankar maintained that New Delhi ""has consistently maintained a firm and uncompromising stance against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. It will continue to do so.""Pakistan's Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif on his part thanked President Trump ""for his leadership and proactive role for peace in the region.""""Pakistan appreciates the United States for facilitating this outcome, which we have accepted in the interest of regional peace and stability,' Sharif posted, adding that ""Pakistan believes this marks a new beginning in the resolution of issues that have plagued the region and prevented its journey toward peace, prosperity and stability.""","US President Donald Trump announced a ""full and immediate ceasefire"" between India and Pakistan arising from what he claimed was ""a long night of talks mediated by the United States"" On the ground though, the guns -- or at least the drones -- did not fall silent, with India accusing Pakistan of violating the ceasefire.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121064275,imgsize-658256,width-400,resizemode-4/121064275.jpg"

Chinese, US officials meet in Geneva to negotiate Trump tariffs





United States and China held direct trade talks in Geneva on Saturday, with discussions expected to continue on Sunday, according to an official, reported Associated Press. The meetings are part of efforts to ease tensions that have triggered steep tariff hikes and increased economic uncertainty worldwide.US treasury secretary Scott Bessent and trade representative Jamieson Greer met with Chinese vice premier He Lifeng in a closed-door session at Villa Saladin, an 18th-century mansion owned by the Swiss government. Officials from both sides confirmed that talks lasted more than ten hours. No breakthroughs were reported after Saturday’s discussions.Donald Trump’s administration has raised tariffs on Chinese goods to a combined 145%. In response, China imposed 125% tariffs on US imports.These steep tariffs are causing disruptions in industries that rely on trade between the world’s two largest economies, with companies and consumers already feeling the pinch.Trump has defended the tariffs, saying they’re necessary to address China’s unfair trade practices and reduce the US trade deficit. He also tied a 20% tariff to China’s alleged role in the fentanyl crisis. The US president recently said an 80% tariff “seems right,” leaving final decisions to Bessent.Trade experts remain sceptical about a breakthrough, but even a small agreement to scale back tariffs would be a positive step.

A Long Line of Terror Entanglements

The 2008 Mumbai attacks, which killed over 170 people, were carried out by Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), a Pakistan-based group whose handlers operated with ISI support. The trial in the US of David Headley confirmed ISI’s links to the attackers.

The 2005 London bombings had connections to individuals who trained in Pakistan’s tribal areas. British intelligence later revealed that the perpetrators had been radicalised and trained in madrassas and camps in Pakistan.

Pulwama 2019, where 40 Indian CRPF jawans were killed, was claimed by Jaish-e-Mohammed, another Pakistan-based group. Despite global pressure, Islamabad neither shut down the group’s operations nor arrested its leadership meaningfully.

Daniel Pearl’s 2002 beheading was orchestrated by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed—who was captured in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, in 2003. Again, within spitting distance of Pakistani military installations.

Abu Zubaydah, Ramzi Yousef, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed—all major al-Qaeda operatives—were captured in Pakistan, sometimes living comfortably with ISI protection, until they weren’t.

Snakes in the Backyard







Fourteen years after al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden was killed by US Navy SEALs in a covert operation in Abbottabad, the shadow of his presence still looms large over Pakistan’s security narrative. And in the latest turn of irony only Pakistan’s military establishment could serve up, the ghost of bin Laden is back—this time, through bloodlines.Read: India-Pakistan Tension - live updates At the centre of the current controversy is Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry , the suave and media-trained Director General of Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the Pakistani military’s propaganda wing. While Gen Chaudhry has become the face of Pakistan’s official messaging following the Indian military’s Operation Sindoor—a retaliatory strike that wiped out nine terror camps across Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir—the scrutiny has shifted to his father: Sultan Bashiruddin Mahmood , a nuclear scientist who once had tea and theological debates with none other than Osama bin Laden.Yes, the same bin Laden who was later found and killed in a compound just a stone’s throw from the Pakistan Military Academy, raising serious questions about how such a high-value target could hide in plain sight.Sultan Bashiruddin Mahmood was not just any nuclear scientist. He played key roles in Pakistan’s Kahuta Enrichment Plant and Chashma Nuclear Project. After retiring, he founded an organisation called Ummah Tameer-e-Nau (UTN), which, among other things, proposed—earnestly—using djinns to produce electricity.Somewhere along this delusional path, he also met with bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri in Afghanistan months before 9/11.US intelligence agencies were alarmed by the possibility that a Pakistani nuclear scientist had direct access to al-Qaeda leadership. Mahmood was picked up, questioned, and later released. But the damage was done: he was placed on Pakistan’s Exit Control List and became a symbol of how porous the walls are between Pakistan’s scientific, military, and extremist circles.Now, his son—Lt Gen Chaudhry—is spearheading Pakistan’s information warfare while claiming victimhood. As AIMIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi put it: “Osama bin Laden was found taking shelter in a military area of Pakistan. It is for the Western world to realise that Pakistan is a failed state... their nuclear bombs must be disarmed.”The bin Laden saga is just one chapter in a thick volume of accusations:Even today, Pakistan’s Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) remain breeding grounds for Taliban offshoots, al-Qaeda remnants, and more recently, Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which has carried out multiple attacks within Pakistan itself.In fact, Pakistan’s ministers even had foot-in-mouth moments where they admitted their links to terror. Pakistan’s Defence Minister Khawaja Asif told Sky News that the country had been “doing the US’s dirty work” by nurturing terror groups for decades. Former Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari echoed similar sentiments, framing Pakistan’s past as an open secret. These statements effectively confirmed what the world suspected all along: Pakistan wasn’t just a victim of terror—it was a sponsor.The current Army Chief, General Asim Munir, represents a more ideological and Islamist version of military dominance. His speech days before the deadly April 2025 Pahalgam terror attack invoked the two-nation theory and renewed Pakistan’s claims over Kashmir, stoking tensions that quickly escalated into bloodshed.The West’s long complicity in ignoring Pakistan’s terror links has come full circle.

A 5.7-magnitude earthquake struck Pakistan on Saturday morning, Reuters reported. The tremor occurred just hours after a 4.0-magnitude quake had hit the region.Shallow earthquakes tend to be more dangerous than deeper ones because their seismic waves have a shorter distance to travel to the Earth's surface. This results in stronger ground shaking, increasing the potential for structural damage and higher casualties.Pakistan is among the most seismically active countries in the world due to its position along the boundary between the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates. The ongoing collision between these plates generates frequent and often destructive seismic activity.Several major fault lines run through the country, further heightening its vulnerability. The provinces of Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Gilgit-Baltistan, and the former FATA lie on the southern edge of the Eurasian Plate, while Sindh, Punjab, and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir sit on the north-western edge of the Indian Plate.",Shallow earthquakes tend to be more dangerous than deeper ones because their seismic waves have a shorter distance to travel to the Earth's surface.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday called a meeting of National Command Authority after India targeted at least four Pakistan air bases in response to Pakistan’s recent cross-border drone and missile attacks that targeted multiple Indian military and civilian locations.National Command Authority is Pakistan’s highest security decision-making body, comprising senior civilian and military leaders. It oversees key national security matters, including the country’s nuclear weapons policy and strategic planning.However, Pakistan's defence minister Khawaja Asif, later said that no such meeting was held.""This thing that you have spoken about (nuclear option) is present, but let's not talk about it - we should treat it as a very distant possibility, we shouldn't even discuss it in the immediate context,"" Asif told ARY TV.""Before we get to that point, I think temperatures will come down.

Defence sources confirmed that Indian forces successfully thwarted these attacks, which were aimed at key infrastructure such as airports and air bases, for a second consecutive night.On Thursday night, Indian defence systems also intercepted and neutralized drones and missiles launched in an attempt to strike military installations in 15 northern and western Indian cities.The latest actions are part of a broader Indian military response under Operation Sindoor, which began on Wednesday.As part of that operation, Indian armed forces carried out precise missile strikes on nine terror targets in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) and Pakistan. The operation was launched in retaliation for the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack, which claimed the lives of 26 innocent civilians.","Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif called a meeting of National Command Authority.

Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) claimed responsibility for the attack.Two more Pakistani soldiers were killed in a clash with Baloch insurgents The attack by TTP took place on Thursday night on Pakistan military's Dawngate outpost in Shakai sub-division of South Waziristan, sources said. TTP claimed it was a multi-phase operation, initially killing six soldiers using laser-aided rifles after which a military convoy sent to support the besieged outpost was ambushed.According to the group, 20 security personnel were killed and five wounded.TTP accused Pakistan army of leaking coordinates of Jaish-e-Mohammed's Bahawalpur Markaz, which was targeted in an Indian air strike that killed 14, including 10 family members of JeM chief Masood Azhar.

The attacks occurred in multiple locations, including Turbat, where a grenade attack targeted Pakistani forces in D Baloch area, and Quetta, where two grenade attacks hit Pakistani army posts in Hazarganji and Faizabad areas.The fresh attacks came two days after Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) targeted Pakistani military vehicle in Bolan.

LONDON: Sky News has traced social media accounts expressing support for jihadist terrorist groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and al-Qaida to the exact location of the building in Muridke, Pakistan, which was struck by India last week in retaliation for the Pahalgam terrorist attack .A Sky News forensics and data team geolocated to Markaz Taiba in Muridke multiple videos on TikTok, YouTube and Google which express support for the LeT and ""313"", referring to the 313 Brigade , al-Qaida's military wing in Pakistan.The videos were posted before India blew the complex up last week. The channel confirmed the video locations using satellite imagery in and around the complex.According to Stanford University's mapping militants project, members of 313 Brigade include Taliban and allied jihadist groups, such as Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami, LeT and Jaish-e-Muhammed . 313 Brigade has been behind many high-profile attacks and bombings inside Pakistan.Captions, hashtags and usernames posting these videos express support for either or both the LeT and ""313"". One video shows a man with a gun and the username states: ""Lashkar Taiba - Markaz Taiba Muridke - 313 Bhai Group - Mujahid Force PK"".A TikTok video with the text ""313"" is captioned ""bring your arms and ammunition and go to war"".Muskan Sangwan, senior intelligence analyst at TRAC, a terrorism research consortium, said: ""These young men posing with rifles are using 313 label as a badge for jihadist identity,"" which, she said, would help with recruitment.One video with the hashtag ""313 jihad"" shows children practising sword-fighting inside the mosque, with the caption ""We are little soldiers, and we fight the non-believers"". The Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI) told Sky News: ""It has been known for decades that LeT has its headquarters in Muridke.""Pakistan-based Resistance Front, an LeT proxy, initially claimed responsibility for the Pahalgam attack.

US president Donald Trump on Thursday confirmed a trade framework with the United Kingdom that reduces tariffs on autos and metals while keeping the baseline 10% tariff as it is. The announcement followed a phone call with UK prime minister Keir Starmer Under the plan, US tariffs on British cars will drop from 27.5% to 10% for a quota of 100,000 vehicles. Tariffs on steel and aluminium will be removed. In return, the UK will increase purchases of US agricultural goods, simplify customs for American products, and cut import taxes on around 2,500 items, including olive oil, wine, and sports equipment.The Republican president indicated that other countries negotiating trade deals with the US could face steeper import taxes.Referring to the UK’s 10% tariff rate, Trump said, “That’s a low number,” and argued that nations with which the US runs trade deficits—and which he claimed had treated the US unfairly—would be subject to higher tariffs.US stocks meanwhile surged Thursday as investor optimism grew following the announcement of the trade deal between the United States and the United Kingdom that could ease recession fears by lowering select tariffs and restrictions.Earlier, during simultaneous press conferences in London and Washington, Keir Starmer appeared via video link from the White House alongside Donald Trump, calling the US-UK trade agreement “a truly fantastic and historic day.”","US president Donald Trump confirmed a trade framework with the United Kingdom that reduces tariffs on autos and metals.

The footage, released by American journalist James O’Keefe. Bryan also says that Prince Andrew lied to him about the nature of his relationship with Epstein.This video comes just days after the death of Virginia Giuffre , the woman who accused Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell, and Prince Andrew of abuse. Giuffre was found dead on 25 April in what authorities have reported as a suicide. However, her father, Sky Roberts, has publicly rejected this, saying, “There’s no way that she did. Somebody got to her.”Virginia Giuffre was one of the most vocal accusers in the Epstein scandal. She claimed she was trafficked to Prince Andrew when she was 17 years old—an accusation the Duke has strongly denied. In 2022, Prince Andrew reached an out-of-court settlement with Giuffre. The deal included a statement expressing regret for his association with Epstein, though it did not include any apology or admission of liability.Days before her death, Giuffre had posted about being seriously injured in a car crash. Police later questioned how serious the accident was.Since 2019, Prince Andrew has withdrawn from public royal duties following his widely criticised BBC Newsnight interview about Epstein.","A secretly recorded video shows Prince Andrew ’s former adviser, John Bryan, alleging the Duke of York had sex with underage girls.

The Bank of England is expected to cut interest rates in the face of US tariffs threat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/the-bank-of-england-is-expected-to-cut-interest-rates-in-the-face-of-us-tariffs-threat/articleshow/120987594.cms,"Bank of England (File Photo AP)

Poll Should the Bank of England adopt a more proactive approach to monetary policy? Yes, absolutely No, they should be cautious





LONDON: The Bank of England is widely expected to look past near-term inflationary pressures in the British economy and opt to cut interest rates on Thursday as a result of the potential shock to growth emanating from the tariff policies of the Trump administration.Most economists believe it's a near-certainty that the nine-member monetary policy committee will sanction a quarter-point reduction in the bank's main interest rate, to 4.25%. The decision is to be announced at 12:02 p.m., two minutes later than usual as a result of the two-minute silence for Victory in Europe Day. There's some speculation that some members may opt for an even bigger half-point cut.Economists are going to be particularly interested in the bank's accompanying economic forecasts as they will be the first since US President Donald Trump made his tariff announcement in early April.Though most tariffs were paused for 90 days following the ensuing market turmoil, including the 10% baseline tariff applied to UK goods entering the United States, the backdrop for the global economy remains highly uncertain.""With US trade policy presenting a new demand shock, there have been early signs that the MPC is willing to adopt a more proactive approach to loosening policy,"" said Edward Allenby, UK economist at Oxford Economics.The forecasts, particularly those regarding growth and inflation, will provide a steer as to whether a more proactive approach is likely. Since it started cutting interest rates in August 2024 from the 16-year high of 5.25%, the MPC has been consistent in lowering borrowing costs every three months.The imposition of US tariffs on British goods, and the potential for a wider global trade war, has the potential to weigh on growth as well as oil prices, which would consequently depress price pressures by lowering demand.Though UK inflation stands at 2.6% and could well hit double the bank's target rate of 2% in coming months as a result of a raft of price increases in April, such as domestic energy and water bills, economists think rate-setters will opt for a cut, given the anticipated slowdown.Unlike the Bank of England, and the European Central Bank, which last month cut interest rates too, the US Federal Reserve kept rates unchanged Wednesday as its policymakers wait to see how Trump's tariffs affect the US economy before making any moves.Inflation rates around the world are way down from levels seen a couple of years ago, partly because central banks dramatically increased borrowing costs from the near zero rates during the coronavirus pandemic. Prices then began to shoot up, first as a result of supply chain issues and later because of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which pushed energy costs higher.As inflation rates have declined from multidecade highs, central banks, including the Fed, have started cutting interest rates, though few, if any, economists think that rates will fall back to the super-low levels that persisted in the years after the global financial crisis of 2008-2009 and during the pandemic.","Bank of England is widely expected to cut interest rates on Thursday.

TOI CORRESPONDENT FROM LONDON: Despite the rhetoric that tensions between India and Pakistan might spill over onto Britain’s streets, things were calm on Wednesday and members of the Indian and Pakistani diaspora were all still getting on with each other.“Our fight is not against any community, religion, or nationality — it is against terrorism and the nations that sponsor it,” said a spokesman for British Indians Voice. He said the diaspora supported India’s military strike. “India has shown restraint for decades. This was not a reckless strike — it was a measured and necessary response to repeated acts of terror emanating from Pakistani soil. We stand with our homeland. It is time for the world to unite against terror. Because silence is no longer an option.”British Indian Santosh Patil said: “Terrorism has no place in a civilised society and anywhere where terrorist sympathising groups are based should meet the same fate. British Indians feel it is the right thing that happened as India attacked a terrorist group. We are still getting on with British Pakistani friends and neighbours.This is not an attack on Pakistan but on terrorism.”Ganapati Bhat, Kannadigaruuk president, said: “The whole community have a sense of justice being done because it was the worst of kind of terrorist attack on 22nd April and India has been at the receiving end of terrorism since Independence. Retaliation was not there previously, except for a couple of instances, and this time they have done it very well and eliminated this terrorist infrastructure so we feel satisfied. There is a bit of worry that things could impact trust issues among communities but I think people view Pakistan and terrorists as separate things. These things have been happening for over a decade, so I don’t see it spilling over into UK’s streets.”Amjid Ali Akram Jarral Rajput, a British Kashmiri with roots in J&K, said: “It’s dreadful what has happened.” He has family on both sides of border. “This is just another way to escalate what is happening and bring the world’s attention to Kashmir. This is due to what Britain did and the mess it left Kashmir in.”British Pakistani Murtuza Ali Shah, bureau chief for Geo News in the UK, said: “British Pakistanis are worried about their families in the region.” He said he did not see tensions playing out on UK streets. “We have all lived here a long time and fought racism together. Many of us are friends,” Shah said.","British Indian Santosh Patil said: “Terrorism has no place in a civilised society and anywhere where terrorist sympathising groups are based should meet the same fate.” British Pakistani Murtuza Ali Shah, bureau chief for Geo News in the UK, said he did not see tensions playing out on UK streets.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120974637,imgsize-953489,width-400,resizemode-4/120974637.jpg"

Working for GRU:

Like a 'spy novel':





Six Bulgarians, members of a sophisticated spy network dubbed ""The Minions"", were before court Wednesday for sentencing, facing up to 14 years in prison for spying for Russia The four men and two women either pled guilty or had been convicted of charges of conspiracy to spy at Russia's behest with their sentences due to be handed down on Monday, after four days of hearings at London's Old Bailey court.Between 2020 to 2023, the six-person cell targeted journalists and a Kazakh former politician, and plotted to kidnap and honeytrap targets, tracking them across several European nations.It was "" industrial-scale espionage on behalf of Russia"", Metropolitan police counter-terrorism Chief Commander Dominic Murphy said in March.Ringleader Orlin Roussev, 47, along with his second-in-command Bizer Dzhambazov, 43, and Ivan Stoyanov, 32, pled guilty to spying.Barrister for the prosecution, Alison Morgan, on Wednesday laid out their roles in different operations, stressing they knew they were spying for Moscow.London-based Katrin Ivanova, 33, Vanya Gaberova, 30, and Tihomir Ivanchev, 39, were convicted in March after a trial lasting more than three months at the Old Bailey court.Two of the group were in court on Wednesday, with the rest appearing by video link from their detention centres.They had dubbed themselves ""The Minions"" after the cartoon yellow characters in the film ""Despicable Me"" who work for the dastardly Gru. The six also worked for the GRU, the acronym for the Russian military intelligence service.The group launched operations in the UK as well as Austria, Spain, Germany and Montenegro.But UK police were able to retrace six operations thanks to more than 100,000 messages found on Roussev's Telegram account, which led police to his seaside home in the eastern town of Great Yarmouth.Roussev received his instructions from Jan Marsalek, an Austrian fugitive who reportedly fled to Russia in 2020 after becoming wanted for fraud in Germany.Marsalek, the former chief operating officer of payments firm Wirecard, was acting as a proxy for Russian intelligence services.One operation targeted investigative journalist Christo Grozev, from the Bellingcat website, who uncovered Russian links to the 2018 Novichok chemical weapon attack in the English town of Salisbury and the downing of a Malaysia Airlines aeroplane four years earlier.The group had planned ""disruptive activity"" at the Kazakh embassy in 2022, discussing a plan to spray the building with fake pig's blood.Roussev received more than 200,000 euros ($227,000) to fund his activities.After the gang was busted in February 2023, police found huge amounts of spyware equipment in his home, including cameras and microphones hidden in ties, a stone, even a cuddly toy and a fizzy drinks bottle.In messages to Marsalek, Roussev claimed ""he will find the resources"" to ""keep the Russians happy"" such as by kidnapping someone, Morgan said.""The defendants were deployed to gather information about prominent individuals whose activities were of obvious interest to the Russian state,"" she added.Murphy said in March that police had found ""really sophisticated devices -- the sort of thing you would really expect to see in a spy novel"".Journalist and UK-based dissident Roman Dobrokhotov, and former Kazakh politician Bergey Ryskaliev, granted refugee status in Britain, were also among their targets.The group also kept the US military base Patch Barracks in Stuttgart, Germany, under surveillance, believing Ukrainian soldiers were being trained there in using the Patriot air defence system.Ties between Britain and Russia have been strained since Moscow's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine.British security minister Dan Jarvis warned the convictions should ""send a clear warning to those who wish to do the UK harm"".","Six Bulgarians, members of a sophisticated spy network dubbed ""The Minions"", facing up to 14 years in prison for spying for Russia.

Completely insane





A firefighter in France was in a critical condition Saturday after being hit in what appeared to be a deliberate attack by a 19-year-old motorist as Prime Minister Francois Bayrou denounced the ""curse"" of urban rodeo stunts plaguing French cities.France has a tradition of "" urban rodeos "", in which young motorists and bike riders perform noisy, high-speed stunts, disrupting traffic.Interior minister Bruno Retailleau was expected to visit the scene in the eastern town of Evian-les-Bains later Saturday.Bayrou said the urban rodeos were a ""curse"" many French cities and towns struggled with and said the government was working to clamp down on them.""There is so much madness and disorder in the minds of people who believe that others don't matter, that their lives, their safety and their peace of mind don't matter,"" he told reporters.The victim, a 38-year-old volunteer firefighter, was hit at around 6:00 am Saturday while trying to stop an urban rodeo involving two cars near his fire station.Prosecutors said several firefighters asked the drivers to stop.A ""verbal altercation"" ensued, with one of the drivers, a 19-year-old man, ""deliberately"" ramming a firefighter with his vehicle, the public prosecutor's office said.He also ""narrowly missed hitting another"", prosecutors added.The driver has been taken into custody.Officers found three canisters of laughing gas, a bottle of vodka and a can of Red Bull in his vehicle, which had impact marks on the front and cracks on the windscreen.He is known to the police, and his driving licence has been suspended since mid-April.The other driver was also taken into custody.""It's completely insane that someone would attack firefighters,"" Martial Saddier, head of the Haute-Savoie department, told a local radio station.One of them was hit ""with extreme violence, which is why he is in such a serious condition"", he added.Saddier said the firefighter had been airlifted to the hospital in Annecy in southeastern France.""Zero tolerance for these individuals who lack judgement and show no respect for public safety and order,"" Jean-Paul Bosland, president of the National Federation of Firefighters of France, said on X.The rowdy races and stunts, which have become increasingly popular, especially in low-income neighbourhoods, have caused multiple accidents.Some people however defend them as a gritty urban subculture that provides an outlet for disaffected youths.""Rodeo"", a film that appears to glorify the gatherings, generated strong buzz at the Cannes film festival in 2022.On Friday, Justice Minister Gerald Darmanin said the ""scourge of urban rodeos"" was ""ruining the lives of many French people"".He called on prosecutors to take ""the strongest possible action.""From now on, they must systematically seize vehicles involved in rodeos and, as the law allows, sell them or have them destroyed even before the trial,"" said Darmanin. ""No more impunity!""On Friday, around 500 cars and nearly 3,000 people gathered for an urban rodeo in the southwestern city of Bordeaux before being dispersed by police.A week ago, a local councillor in southwestern France was assaulted after trying to stop a motorcycle rodeo.

A court in Paris on Tuesday is set to hand down a verdict in the sexual assault trial of French cinema icon Gerard Depardieu , a case that gripped the country for weeks.As the ruling will coincide with the start of the Cannes Film Festival , it is likely to be among the biggest talking points on the first day of what is one of the main events on the cinema calendar.Depardieu, who has acted in more than 200 films and television series, is the highest-profile figure caught up in France's response to the #MeToo movement He has been accused of improper behaviour by around 20 women, but this is the first case to come to trial.The trial relates to charges of sexual assault during the filming in 2021 of ""Les Volets Verts"" (""The Green Shutters"") by director Jean Becker.Nearly two months after the high-profile proceedings, the Paris Criminal Court will deliver its verdict from 10:00 am (0800 GMT) Tuesday.The plaintiffs are a set dresser, 54, identified only as Amelie, and a 34-year-old assistant director, who accuse the actor of sexual assault. Only Amelie is expected to be present to hear the verdict.Depardieu, 76, might not be in attendance.The actor, who had complained that he had been out of work for three years, is set to star in a film directed by his friend, actor Fanny Ardant. The shooting of the scenes involving Depardieu began in April in the Portuguese archipelago of the Azores.In March, lead prosecutor Laurent Guy recommended an 18-month suspended jail sentence for Depardieu, arguing that the assaults reported by the two women were ""intentional"".He said Depardieu should also be ordered to undergo psychological treatment, and be added to France's sex offender registry.Amelie said that the actor had behaved like a ""wild animal"" on set in 2021. Depardieu had boasted he could ""give women an orgasm without touching them"", she said.She also said Depardieu made ""obscene remarks"" including: ""Come and touch my big parasol. I'll stick it in your pussy.""The actor has denied sexually assaulting the women.""I'm vulgar, rude, foul-mouthed, I'll accept that,"" he told the court, but he added: ""I don't touch.""""I adore women and femininity,"" he also said, while describing the #MeToo movement as a ""reign of terror"".Throughout the trial, Depardieu has been supported by his daughter Roxane, his ex-partner Karine Silla and actor Vincent Perez.Long-time friend Ardant, 76, testified in his favour.""I have never witnessed anything that I found shocking,"" she said.""I know that you can say no to Gerard.""Lawyers representing the two plaintiffs complained of the tension in the courtroom and denounced the approach of Depardieu's defence team.The actor's lawyer Jeremie Assous called the two women ""liars"" and ""hysterical"". They were working for the cause of ""rabid feminism"", he argued.Claude Vincent, the assistant director's lawyer, lamented in her closing statement: ""What we witnessed was not a defence strategy,"" but ""an apology for sexism.""In an open letter, a group of nearly 200 French lawyers urged the judiciary to fight what they called courtroom sexism.Depardieu's lawyer had ""used sexism and misogyny to his heart's delight"" to discredit the plaintiffs and their legal team, they said.Depardieu has also been indicted in another case following a rape complaint filed by actor Charlotte Arnould, 29. Prosecutors have requested a trial.In April, French MPs criticised ""endemic"" abuse in the entertainment industry after a six-month inquiry.Depardieu became a star in France from the 1980s with roles in ""The Last Metro"", ""Police"" and ""Cyrano de Bergerac"", before Peter Weir's ""Green Card"" also made him a Hollywood celebrity.He later acted in global productions including Kenneth Branagh's ""Hamlet"", Ang Lee's ""Life of Pi"" and Netflix's ""Marseille"" series.","Depardieu is the highest-profile figure caught up in France's response to the #MeToo movement.

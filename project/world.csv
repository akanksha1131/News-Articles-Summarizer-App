Trump's big bill advances in rare weekend vote as conservative holdouts secure changes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-big-bill-advances-in-rare-weekend-vote-as-conservative-holdouts-secure-changes/articleshow/121258953.cms,"The bill includes tax cuts, increased border security spending and modifications to Medicaid and other programs (Image: AP)





Republicans advanced their massive tax cut and border security package out of a key House committee during a rare Sunday night vote as deficit hawks who blocked the measure two days earlier reversed course after gaining commitments on the package's spending cuts.Speaker Mike Johnson met with Republican lawmakers shortly before the meeting, telling reporters that the changes agreed to were ""just some minor modifications. Not a huge thing.""Democrats on the panel pressed for more details about the changes that Republicans had agreed to in the private negotiations. But Representative Jodey Arrington, the chairman of the House Budget Committee , said he could not do so.""Deliberations continue at this very moment,"" Arrington said. ""They will continue on into the week, and I suspect right up until the time we put this big, beautiful bill on the floor of the House.""The first time Republicans tried advancing the bill out of the House Budget Committee, deficit hawks joined with Democratic lawmakers in voting against reporting the measure to the full House. Five Republicans voted no, one on procedural grounds, the other four voicing concerns about the bill's impact on federal budget deficits.On Sunday evening, the four voicing concerns about the bill's impact on the deficit voted present, and the measure passed by a vote of 17-16.Johnson is looking to put the bill on the House floor before the end of the week.""This is the vehicle through which we will deliver on the mandate that the American people gave us in the last election,"" he said on "" Fox News Sunday.""The Republicans who criticized the measure noted that the bill's new spending and the tax cuts are front-loaded in the bill, while the measures to offset the cost are back-loaded. For example, they are looking to speed up the new work requirements that Republicans want to enact for able-bodied participants in Medicaid. Those requirements would not kick in until 2029 under the current bill.""We are writing checks we cannot cash, and our children are going to pay the price,"" said Representative Chip Roy, R-Texas, a member of the committee. ""Something needs to change, or you're not going to get my support.""Johnson said the start date for the work requirements was designed to give states time to ""retool their systems"" and to ""make sure that all the new laws and all the new safeguards that we're placing can actually be enforced.""Roy was joined in voting no by Representatives Ralph Norman of South Carolina, Josh Brecheen of Oklahoma and Andrew Clyde of Georgia. Representative Lloyd Smucker of Pennsylvania switched his vote to no in a procedural step so it could be reconsidered later, saying after the hearing he was confident Republicans would ""get this done."" Johnson said talks to deal with their concerns were continuing Sunday.Remarkably, the vote against advancing the bill came after President Donald Trump had called on Republicans in a social media post to unite behind it.""We don't need 'GRANDSTANDERS' in the Republican Party,"" Trump posted. ""STOP TALKING, AND GET IT DONE!""At its core, the sprawling package permanently extends the existing income tax cuts that were approved during Trump's first term, in 2017, and adds temporary new ones that the president campaigned on in 2024, including no taxes on tips, overtime pay and auto loan interest payments. The measure also proposes big spending increases for border security and defense.The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan fiscal watchdog group, estimates that the House bill is shaping up to add roughly $3.3 trillion to the debt over the next decade.Democrats are overwhelmingly opposed to the measure, which Republicans have labelled ""The One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act."" Representative Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., called it, ""one big, beautiful betrayal"" in Friday's hearing.""This spending bill is terrible, and I think the American people know that,"" Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-SC, told CNN's ""State of the Union'' on Sunday. ""There is nothing wrong with us bringing the government in balance. But there is a problem when that balance comes on the back of working men and women. And that's what is happening here.""Johnson is not just having to address the concerns of the deficit hawks in his conference. He's also facing pressure from centrists who will be warily eyeing the proposed changes to Medicaid, food assistance programs and the rolling back of clean energy tax credits. Republican lawmakers from New York and elsewhere are also demanding a much large state and local tax deduction As it stands, the bill proposes tripling what's currently a $10,000 cap on the state and local tax deduction, increasing it to $30,000 for joint filers with incomes up to $400,000 a year.Representative Nick LaLota, one of the New York lawmakers leading the effort to lift the cap, said they have proposed a deduction of $62,000 for single filers and $124,000 for joint filers.If the bill passes the House this week, it would then move to the Senate, where Republican lawmakers are also eyeing changes that could make final passage in the House more difficult.Johnson said: ""The package that we send over there will be one that was very carefully negotiated and delicately balanced, and we hope that they don't make many modifications to it because that will ensure its passage quickly.""","The bill includes tax cuts, increased border security spending and modifications to Medicaid and other programs.

Years of conflict and rising militancy in Borno





In one of the deadliest attacks in Nigeria’s Borno, at least 57 people were killed and over 70 reported missing after militants linked to Boko Haram 's Jama'atu Ahlis Sunna Lidda'awati wal-Jihad (JAS) faction attacked two villages on Thursday.Eyewitnesses said that militants stormed the neighbouring villages of Mallam Karamti and Kwatandashi, gathering more than 100 residents and forcing them into the surrounding bush, news agency AP reported.According to locals, 57 bodies were recovered by Saturday, many with their throats slit, while others had been shot.Witnesses also said the victims’ burial was delayed due to the military’s unavailability to assist in the search for bodies.A spokesperson for the Borno state government said that they could not confirm the exact casualty figures, while the Nigerian military has yet to respond to requests for comment.The villagers were accused of being informants for the rival Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP). While ISWAP is known for attacking military targets, the JAS faction has increasingly focused on civilians and suspected collaborators, relying on robberies and kidnappings for ransom.""Without the capacity to attack the military like ISWAP, JAS is focused on terrorizing civilians,"" said Malik Samuel, a conflict expert with the nonprofit Good Governance Africa The mass killing occurred during a surge of violence in Borno state. On Monday, ISWAP militants launched a deadly assault on the Nigerian Army’s 50 Task Force Battalion in Marte, killing several soldiers and seizing weapons and ammunition.Following this, displaced residents in Marte fled to Dikwa, a key humanitarian hub. However, aid organizations are now withdrawing from the area due to international funding cuts.In a separate incident on Saturday afternoon, a roadside bomb exploded along the Maiduguri-Damboa road, the second such attack in a week which killed 4 people and injured 10 others.Three people died at the scene, and a fourth succumbed to injuries Sunday morning at the University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital (UMTH). More than 10 others were still being treated for injuries at the hospital, a local resident, Lawan Bukar Maigana, who has assisted the community in emergencies, said.Since 2009, the Boko Haram insurgency has caused over 35,000 deaths and displaced 2.6 million people across Nigeria, Cameroon, Niger, and Chad, with Borno remaining the worst affected.The insurgents aim to establish an all Islamic state across these four countries, with Nigeria—West Africa’s most populous nation and oil powerhouse—as their primary target.The Nigerian government has claimed progress against the insurgency, but the militants continue to attack civilians and military and have expanded into other regions, including central Nigeria where the capital Abuja is located, according to experts and public records on counterterrorism.While the Nigerian government claims it has made progress in combating the insurgency, militant attacks continue against both civilians and security forces.","Militants linked to Boko Haram attacked two villages in Nigeria's Borno state.

‘He killed himself’: FBI chiefs Kash Patel and Dan Bongino insist Jeffry Epstein died by suicide,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/he-killed-himself-fbi-chiefs-kash-patel-and-dan-bongino-insist-jeffry-epstein-died-by-suicide/articleshow/121258536.cms,"File photo: FBI director Kash Patel (right) and deputy director Dan Bongino (Picture credit: X/@FBIDDBongino)

'WAVE OF TRANSPARENCY': FBI director hints at agency's move to rebuild Americans' trust





FBI director Kash Patel and deputy director Dan Bongino have firmly asserted that Jeffrey Epstein ’s death in a Manhattan jail cell in 2019 was a suicide, pushing back against persistent conspiracy theories that he was murdered to protect powerful individuals.Their comments came during a joint appearance on Fox News’ Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo.“He killed himself,” Bongino said plainly during the interview. “I’ve seen the whole file. He killed himself.” Patel backed this view, saying, “As someone who’s been a public defender, a prosecutor, who’s been in that prison system, you know a suicide when you see one, and that’s what that was.”He acknowledged sceptics have a right to their opinion but insisted there was no foul play.Bongino reiterated his stance on X, writing: “I have reviewed the case. Jeffrey Epstein killed himself. There’s no evidence in the case file indicating otherwise. If new evidence surfaces, I’m happy to reevaluate.”Epstein was found hanged in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center on August 10, 2019, a month after his arrest on sex trafficking charges.His death was ruled a suicide by New York City’s chief medical examiner.However, two guards on duty reportedly fell asleep and failed to check on him, and the hallway surveillance cameras had malfunctioned, a combination that fuelled public suspicion.Adding to the controversy, Epstein’s family hired forensic pathologist Dr Michael Baden, who concluded Epstein’s neck injuries suggested homicide. “The fractures were more consistent with strangulation,” he argued.However, Dr Barbara Sampson, the city’s medical examiner at the time, countered, “The cause is hanging, the manner is suicide. I stand firmly behind our determination.”The speculation around Epstein’s death was further stoked in February after US attorney general Pam Bondi released a batch of Epstein-related documents.As per Fox News, the files contained little more than contact information and did not reveal any so-called “client list,” prompting backlash from Republican lawmakers.Rep Anna Paulina Luna called the release “a complete disappointment,” demanding the full information be made public.Bondi later said that after pressuring the DOJ, she received “a truckload of evidence” from the Southern District of New York. She promised a full FBI report was coming, though none has been released yet.The Epstein case resurfaced in headlines recently after the death of Virginia Giuffre , one of his most prominent accusers.As per The New York Times, Giuffre died by suicide at her farm in Western Australia in April.She had sued Britain’s Prince Andrew in 2021, accusing him of sexually abusing her when she was a minor, a claim he denied but later settled privately.Giuffre had played a central role in publicly exposing Epstein’s crimes. In 2015, she gave up her anonymity and was quoted by The Mail on Sunday, “Basically, I was training to be a prostitute for him and his friends.”She said she was recruited at age 16 by Ghislaine Maxwell , who was later convicted of sex trafficking in 2021 and sentenced to 20 years in prison.During the interview, Bongino and Patel also hinted that more revelations related to FBI investigations were forthcoming. Patel alleged that former FBI leadership “withheld and hid documentation” related to several high-profile probes. “Just give us about a week or two,” he added, suggesting a new wave of transparency may be imminent.","FBI director Kash Patel and deputy director Dan Bongino firmly asserted that Jeffrey Epstein’s death in a Manhattan jail cell in 2019 was a suicide.

Israel will allow a ""basic amount"" of food into the Gaza Strip, the prime minister office announced Sunday. This decision came following growing international pressure to ease a total blockade that has been in place for more than two months.The announcement was made hours after the military launched ""extensive ground operations"" as part of an intensified campaign in Gaza. It also coincided with ongoing indirect talks between Israel and Hamas aimed at possible ceasefire.Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 's office said that following a military recommendation, ""Israel will authorise the entry of a basic amount of food for the population to ensure that a hunger crisis does not develop in the Gaza Strip"".Hunger crisis could undermine army's operation and Israel would take steps to prevent Hamas from seizing the humanitarian aid.Israel has imposed a blockade since 2 March with an aim to pressurize the Palestinian militant group. However, UN agencies have warned of severe shortage of food, clean water, fuel and medicines.Last week, US President Donald Trump , a key ally of Israel said, ""a lot of people are starving"" promising ""we're going to get that taken care of"".French foreign minister Jean-Noel Barro requested Israel to allow the ""immediate, massive and unhampered"" flow of aid following the recent announcement.On Sunday, Israel military announced that their army had ""begun extensive ground operations throughout the northern and southern Gaza Strip"", and they were ""currently being deployed in key positions"".The campaign launched by Israel, aimed at freeing hostages and defeating Hamas, began Saturday as both sides entered indirect talks in Qatar over a possible deal.Netanyahu’s office said that negotiators in Doha are 'working to exhaust every possibility for a deal -- whether according to the Witkoff framework or as part of ending the fighting.”Steve Witkoff is the US Middle East envoy involved in the discussions.Netanyahu asserted that the deal ""would include the release of all the hostages, the exile of Hamas terrorists, and the disarmament of the Gaza Strip"".Since a two-month ceasefire ended in March, Israel resumed its offensive negotiations mediated by Qatar, Egypt and the United States and have failed to reach a breakthrough.Netanyahu has opposed ending the war without the complete defeat of Hamas while Hamas has refused to disarm.According to A Hamas source, they were willing ""to release all Israeli hostages in one batch, provided that a comprehensive and permanent ceasefire agreement is reached"", but Israel ""wants to release its prisoners in one batch or in two batches in exchange for a temporary truce"".Israeli army chief Eyal Zamir told troops in Gaza on Sunday that the military would “provide flexibility to the political echelon to advance any hostage deal.”“A hostage deal is not a halt, it is an achievement. We are actively working toward it,” he added.On Sunday afternoon, air raid sirens sounded in southern Israel. The army said that one of two projectiles launched from Gaza had been intercepted.The military later issued evacuation orders for several parts of Gaza ahead of an attack, warning it would “launch a powerful strike on any area used for launching rockets.”Gaza civil defense spokesman Mahmud Bassal said that at least 50 people had been killed by Sunday afternoon ""as a result of ongoing Israeli air strikes since the early hours"", as reported by AFP.He added, ""22 people died and at least 100 others were injured in one strike on tents sheltering displaced Palestinians in Al-Mawasi, southern Gaza Strip.""In a statement, the military said that a “preliminary wave” of strikes over the past week had targeted “over 670 Hamas terror sites throughout the Gaza Strip.”Marwan al-Hams, director of field hospitals at Gaza's health ministry, said that since Israel's aid blockade began, ""57 children have died in Gaza as a result of famine"", adding the number could rise if supplies ran out.The health ministry accused Israel of surrendering the Indonesian Hospital in Beit Lahia, cutting off access and ""effectively forcing the hospital out of service,"" leaving the northern region without a functioning public hospital.Gaza's health ministry said Sunday at least 3,193 people have been killed since Israel resumed strikes on March 18, taking the war's overall toll to 53,339.","Israel will allow a ""basic amount"" of food into the Gaza Strip, the prime minister office announced Sunday.

Poll Do you believe the bombing at the fertility clinic was an act of terrorism? Yes No

Several eyewitness accounts capture aftermath of large explosion near Palm Springs, California





A powerful bomb exploded outside a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California, on Saturday, killing one person and injuring at least four others in what the FBI has officially declared an act of terrorism.“This is an intentional act of terrorism,” said Akil Davis, the head of the FBI’s Los Angeles field office, during a press briefing near the site. He added, “This is probably one of the largest bombing investigations that we've had in Southern California.”The explosion ripped through downtown Palm Springs around 11 am (local time), blowing out windows across several blocks and collapsing part of the American Reproductive Centers building.Authorities believe the blast originated from a vehicle in or near the clinic’s parking lot. A charred car axle was all that remained at the scene. Davis confirmed the deceased was near the blast but did not release their identity, citing the need to protect the investigation.According to AP, officials believe the person killed may have been the perpetrator.An AK-47-style rifle was also recovered from the site.While the motive remains unclear, Davis said the clinic “was deliberately targeted.” The FBI has not specified whether the act was domestic or international terrorism.Authorities are also investigating whether the explosion was livestreamed.The clinic confirmed that all staff are safe and that its laboratory, which stores embryos and reproductive materials, was not damaged. “Thank God today happened to be a day that we have no patients,” Dr Maher Abdallah, who leads the clinic, was quoted as saying by AP.The force of the blast was immense, scattering debris across a five-lane street and damaging nearby buildings, including a liquor store and a hospital. As per The New York Times, one witness said the car parts were “blown clear across four lanes.”Palm Springs police chief Andy Mills assured residents that the bombing was an isolated incident and there was no ongoing threat. However, as a precaution, Planned Parenthood closed 19 centres across Southern California.US attorney general Pam Bondi condemned the attack in a statement posted online, calling it “unforgivable,” and adding, “The Trump administration understands that women and mothers are the heartbeat of America.”The Center for Reproductive Rights called the bombing “horrific” and demanded stronger protections for clinics, stating that patients must “feel safe.”Investigators from the FBI, ATF and local agencies remain at the scene, collecting evidence in what could become a landmark terrorism case in California.","A bomb exploded outside a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California, on Saturday, killing one person and injuring at least four others.

A 28-year-old woman from Georgia who went missing in California's Sierra Nevada mountains has stunned authorities and her family with a survival story described as “movie-worthy,"" reports the New York Times. Tiffany Slaton , a travelling dialysis technician and outdoors lover from Jeffersonville, Georgia, has been found safe after surviving 24 days alone in the snowy mountains of California.Slaton's journey began as a short three-day solo camping trip near Shaver and Huntington Lakes, but later turned into a fight for survival that took her more than 40 miles off track, all the way to Vermilion Valley Resort During her time in the wild, Tiffany faced 13 snowstorms, an avalanche, and a serious fall from a cliff. She lost her tent, her bike, and most of her supplies.The journey started on April 20 and soon became very tough. Slaton took her electric bike and camping gear, including two sleeping bags and a tent. Early on, she fell off a cliff and was unconscious for about two hours. When she woke up, she made a splint for one leg and “popped the other knee back into place,” NBC News reports.She had no signal and her phone’s map didn’t work.She tried calling 911 five times, but none went through. At one point, she even asked her phone where the nearest Starbucks was; it said 18 miles away.Her family reported her missing on April 29, and a large-scale search followed, covering roughly 600 square miles. Local authorities and volunteers collectively travelled over 4,000 miles on foot and by vehicle. A helicopter was also deployed, but no trace of her was found until this week.Slaton stayed alive by eating wild leeks and boiling snow for water. She also made tea each day using pine needles and manzanita. To keep herself calm, she wrote in a journal every day.She finally reached Vermilion Valley Resort, hidden deep in the Sierra mountains and often cut off by snow. The cabin she found was unlocked, and the resort owner keeps it that way in case lost hikers need a place to stay.“I thought I had somehow managed to make it to the North Pole,” Slaton said, describing the moment she saw the cabin. Inside, she found a sleeping bag, which she called “the best sleeping bag I had ever seen.”The next day, just before her 28th birthday, the resort owner came. The roads had only just been cleared. “She pops out, didn’t say a word, just ran up, and all she wanted was a hug,” he said. “That’s when I realised who this was.”“She said, ‘Dad, I’m alive, and I’m sorry,’” her father Bobby was quoted as saying to NBC News. “Those prayers were answered.”Fresno County Sheriff John Zanoni called her tale one “they would make movies about.” His colleague Tony Botti added, “She’s a fighter. She’s not going to give up.”","Tiffany Slaton, 28, from Georgia, went missing in California's Sierra Nevada mountains on April 29.

Push for sanctions

'Root causes'





WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump will hold a phone call with Russia's Vladimir Putin on Monday as part of his long-running effort to end the war set off by Moscow's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.Trump had vowed during the US election campaign to halt the conflict within a day of taking office, but his diplomatic efforts have so far yielded little progress.Delegations from Russia and Ukraine held direct negotiations in Istanbul last week for the first time in almost three years, but the talks ended without a commitment to a ceasefire.Both sides traded insults, with Ukraine accusing Moscow of sending a ""dummy"" delegation of low-ranking officials.After the negotiations, Trump announced that he would speak by phone with the Russian president in a bid to end the ""bloodbath"" in Ukraine, which has destroyed large swathes of the country and displaced millions of people.Trump also said he would speak to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and NATO officials, expressing hope that a ""ceasefire will take place, and this very violent war... will end"".Since taking office in January, Trump has repeatedly stressed that he wants to see an end to the conflict, and has recently backed calls for an unconditional 30-day ceasefire.So far, he has mainly focused on upping the pressure on Ukraine and abstained from criticising Putin.Both Moscow and Washington have previously stressed the need for a meeting on the conflict between Putin and Trump.The US president has also argued that ""nothing's going to happen"" on the conflict until he meets Putin face-to-face.At the talks in Istanbul, which were also attended by US officials, Russia and Ukraine agreed to exchange 1,000 prisoners each and trade ideas on a possible truce, but with no concrete commitment.Ukraine's top negotiator, Defence Minister Rustem Umerov, said that the ""next step"" would be a meeting between Putin and Zelensky.Russia said it had taken note of the request.""We consider it possible, but only as a result of the work and upon achieving certain results in the form of an agreement between the two sides,"" the Kremlin's spokesperson said.Ukraine's western allies have since accused Putin of deliberately ignoring calls for a ceasefire and pushed for fresh sanctions against Russia.The leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Italy held a phone call with Trump on Sunday.""Looking ahead to President Trump's call with President Putin tomorrow, the leaders discussed the need for an unconditional ceasefire and for President Putin to take peace talks seriously,"" said a spokesman for British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.""They also discussed the use of sanctions if Russia failed to engage seriously in a ceasefire and peace talks,"" the spokesman said.Zelensky also discussed possible sanctions with US Vice President JD Vance when they met after Pope Leo's inaugural mass at the Vatican on Sunday.""We discussed the talks in Istanbul, where the Russians sent a low-level delegation with no decision-making powers,"" Zelensky wrote on Telegram following the meeting.""We also touched on the need for sanctions against Russia, bilateral trade, defence cooperation, the situation on the battlefield and the future exchange of prisoners.""A senior Ukrainian official from the president's office, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told AFP that they had also discussed preparations for Monday's telephone conversation between Trump and Putin.It was the first meeting between Zelensky and Vance since their heated White House exchange in February.In the Oval Office, Vance publicly accused Zelensky of being ""disrespectful"" towards Trump, who told the Ukrainian leader he should be more grateful and that he had no ""cards"" to play in negotiations with Russia.Ukraine on Sunday said that Russia had launched a record number of drones at the country overnight, targeting various regions, including the capital Kyiv, where a woman was killed.Another man was killed in the southeastern Kherson region, where a railway station and private houses and cars were hit.In an interview with Russian state TV published on Sunday, Putin said that Moscow's aim was to ""eliminate the causes that triggered this crisis, create the conditions for a lasting peace and guarantee Russia's security"", without elaborating further.Russia's references to the ""root causes"" of the conflict typically refer to grievances with Kyiv and the West that Moscow has put forward as justification for launching the invasion in February 2022.They include pledges to ""de-Nazify"" and demilitarise Ukraine, protect Russian speakers in the country's east, push back against NATO expansion and stop Ukraine's westward geopolitical drift.However, Kyiv and the West say that Russia's invasion is an imperial-style land grab.",US President Donald Trump will hold a phone call with Russia's Vladimir Putin on Monday. The call is part of his long-running effort to end the war set off by Moscow's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Delegations from Russia and Ukraine held direct negotiations in Istanbul last week for the first time in almost three years.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121258127,imgsize-162584,width-400,resizemode-4/121258127.jpg"

BREAKING: Biden diagnosed with ‘aggressive’ prostate cancer





Leaders from across the political spectrum have come together in support of former US President Joe Biden after his office announced on Sunday that he has been diagnosed with aggressive prostate cancer.The 82-year-old was diagnosed on Friday following tests that found a prostate nodule.The cancer has metastasized to the bone and carries a Gleason score of 9, indicating one of the most severe forms. However, the cancer is hormone-sensitive, which allows for “effective management,” his office said in a statement.The announcement prompted a rare moment of unity in American politics, as tributes and well-wishes flooded in from Republicans and Democrats alike.“Melania and I are saddened to hear about Joe Biden’s recent medical diagnosis. We extend our warmest and best wishes to Jill and the family, and we wish Joe a fast and successful recovery,” US President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social.Former US Vice President Kamala Harris expressed her support on X, writing, “Joe is a fighter — and I know he will face this challenge with the same strength, resilience, and optimism that have always defined his life and leadership.”Former US President Barack Obama, under whom Biden served as vice president, said via social media, “Nobody has done more to find breakthrough treatments for cancer in all its forms than Joe, and I am certain he will fight this challenge with his trademark resolve and grace.”Republican lawmakers also extended their support. “This is certainly sad news,” said house speaker Mike Johnson, adding that he and his family were praying for Biden.Georgia Rep Marjorie Taylor Greene, whose father died of cancer in 2021, wrote, “Prayers for Joe Biden and his family.”Democratic leaders joined in with heartfelt tributes. Former house speaker Nancy Pelosi said Biden is “a great American patriot” and that she and her husband Paul were “praying for him to have strength and a swift recovery.”California Governor Gavin Newsom said, “A man of dignity, strength, and compassion like his deserves to live a long and beautiful life.”Senator Tim Kaine said Americans would be “with them every step of the way.”Public figures also offered personal reflections. Meghan McCain, whose father Senator John McCain died from brain cancer, wrote, “Cancer is the absolute worst... I don’t believe times like these are appropriate for politics.”Former US secretary of state Hillary Clinton added, “I’m thinking of the Bidens as they take on cancer, a disease they’ve done so much to try to spare other families from.”Piers Morgan took aim at social media users mocking Biden’s condition, writing, “Show some bloody respect.”Former Biden spokesperson TJ Ducklo, who is also battling cancer, tweeted, “Cancer has no f***ing idea who it’s dealing with. Betting against Biden has never been and still remains a bad f***ing bet.”Several others—Senators Susan Collins, Thom Tillis, Mike Lee, Peter Welch, John Fetterman; Governors Wes Moore and JB Pritzker; and Representatives Ro Khanna, Shontel Brown, Eric Swalwell, Jasmine Crockett, Chuck Edwards and more—offered their thoughts and prayers.Biden's diagnosis comes after he experienced urinary symptoms. The cancer’s aggressive nature, Grade Group 5 with bone metastasis, means it’s “very treatable, but not curable,” news agency AP quoted Dr Matthew Smith of Massachusetts General Brigham Cancer Center, as saying.Biden is reportedly reviewing treatment options with his physicians.Biden’s fight against cancer has been personal. His son Beau died of brain cancer in 2015. In 2022, Biden relaunched the “cancer moonshot” with the goal of halving cancer deaths over the next 25 years.","Former US President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with aggressive prostate cancer.

Doctor breaks down Biden's cancer diagnosis





An old video of Joe Biden seemingly admitting to having cancer in 2022 has gone viral on social media, after the former US president was recently diagnosed with an “aggressive” form of prostate cancer The resurfaced footage has reignited conspiracy theories among right-wing figures, who accuse Biden’s team of covering up his health condition for political reasons.The clip, from a press conference on July 20, 2022, in Somerset, Massachusetts, shows Biden discussing the environmental impact of oil pollution in Delaware. “That’s why I, and so damn many other people I grew up with, have cancer,” Biden said at the time. The White House had later dismissed the statement as a “gaffe,” clarifying he had been referring to past skin cancer treatments, not an active diagnosis.However, as news of his current diagnosis spreads, the video has gained renewed attention. On Tuesday, Biden’s team revealed that the 82-year-old has prostate cancer that has metastasised to his bones and is now reviewing treatment options with doctors.The disease was identified after Biden showed urinary symptoms and a prostate nodule was detected.The cancer is said to be hormone-sensitive and has a Gleason score of 9, indicating an advanced stage.Amid the announcement, critics online questioned how such a severe illness could have gone unnoticed. Donald Trump Jr posted, “What I want to know is how did Dr. Jill Biden miss stage five metastatic cancer or is this yet another coverup???”Other users echoed similar sentiments. One viral post accused the administration of lying, claiming: “Advanced prostate cancer takes +10 years to develop… You’re telling me that the best doctors… did notBiden’s cancer in all these years of testing? Bullshit. This is the worst coverup in the history of the Presidency.”Another added, “Joe Biden had the best medical doctors on planet Earth, taking care of him 24/7… they knew about it and participated in the cover-up until after the election.”Biden’s health had already been a major topic during his presidency and reelection campaign before he dropped out in July 2024 following a poor debate performance against Donald Trump.Despite reassurances from the White House physician last summer that Biden was “completely fit for the Presidency,” many supporters and critics alike had expressed concern over his age and cognitive abilities.Former US Vice President Kamala Harris , who stepped in as the Democratic nominee, said Biden would face this challenge with “strength, resilience, and optimism.” Former US President Barack Obama added, “Nobody has done more to find breakthrough treatments for cancer in all its forms than Joe.”Biden’s son Beau died of brain cancer in 2015. Biden had spearheaded the “cancer moonshot” initiative under the Obama administration, calling the fight “personal.”","Video of Joe Biden seemingly admitting to having cancer in 2022 has gone viral on social media.

'Mass casualty event' declared as tornadoes hit Kentucky and Missouri





A fresh wave of deadly tornadoes swept across the central United States over the weekend, killing at least 28 people and injuring dozens more, with Kentucky and Missouri bearing the brunt of the destruction.The storms, which struck on Friday night, are part of what officials described as an unusually violent spring season.According to The New York Times, Kentucky alone reported 19 deaths, with 17 of them in Laurel County. Governor Andy Beshear confirmed that three of the 10 hospitalised victims remain in critical condition.One of those killed was Major Leslie Leatherman, a veteran firefighter who died during emergency operations. The Laurel County Fire Department called his death “a heartbreaking reminder of the dangers our first responders face every day.”The town of Kentucky’s London, was among the hardest-hit areas. Families picked through piles of wreckage and debris over the weekend. Residents like Jeff Wyatt barely escaped as their homes were torn apart. “It happened so fast… If we would have been there 10 seconds longer, we would have been gone with the family room,” Wyatt was quoted as saying by AP.Emergency management officials noted the storms were caused by a line of supercells, long-lasting, intense thunderstorms, which spun off at least 26 tornadoes across Indiana, Kentucky, Illinois, and Missouri.Chad Jenkins, emergency director for Brown County, Indiana, was quoted by NYT as saying, “We’ve been under almost a continuous stream of storms. It’s been a pretty turbulent spring for us.”Missouri recorded seven deaths, including five in St Louis, where Mayor Cara Spencer said about 5,000 buildings were damaged. “I would describe this as one of the worst storms in the city's history,” she said during a Saturday news conference.The storm system also caused fatalities in Virginia, where two people were killed by falling trees, and injured more than a dozen in Indiana.In Kentucky’s London, Ryan VanNorstran, who was house-sitting during the storm, described hearing screaming and feeling the house shake as windows shattered and debris flew. “I’d never really felt that kind of power from just nature,” he was quoted as saying by AP.Federal aid was approved for 24 Kentucky counties just two days before the latest disaster struck.However, as per NYT, recent staff cuts at National Weather Service offices, including a 29% vacancy rate in Louisville, have raised concerns about the country’s disaster response capabilities. Experts warn that vacancy rates above 20% can severely impact emergency preparedness.Despite the staffing shortfalls, Governor Beshear praised federal efforts in the immediate aftermath, saying on X, “Politics has no place in responding to natural disasters like this one.”The National Weather Service has warned that more dangerous weather could hit the region in the coming days, with forecasts of large hail and strong winds across the southern Great Plains, including parts of Oklahoma and Texas.Approximately 1,200 tornadoes hit the US every year, which have been reported in all 50 states over the years. Researchers found in 2018 that deadly tornadoes were happening less frequently in the traditional “Tornado Alley” of Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas and more frequently in parts of the more densely populated and tree-filled mid-South.","Mass casualty event declared as tornadoes hit Kentucky and Missouri.

The Food and Drug Administration on Friday approved the Novavax Covid-19 vaccine, but only for older adults and for others older than 12 who have at least one medical condition that puts them at high risk from Covid.Scientific advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who typically make decisions on who should get approved shots and when, have been debating whether to recommend Covid shots only to the most vulnerable Americans. The FDA’s decision appeared to render at least part of their discussion moot. The new restriction will sharply limit access to the Novavax vaccine for people younger than 65 who are in good health.The vaccine had previously been authorised under emergency use. Covid vaccines developed by Pfizer and Moderna, which are more widely used by Americans, were granted full approval in 2022. For companies working on updated shots for the fall, the new riders portend a more restrictive approach from the FDA.The FDA’s new restrictions appear to reflect the high degree of skepticism about vaccines from Robert F Kennedy Jr, the health secretary, and the other leaders he has appointed at health agencies.","The FDA approved the Novavax Covid-19 vaccine, but only for older adults and for others older than 12 who have at least one medical condition that puts them at high risk from Covid.

We extend our warmest and best wishes to Jill and the family, and we wish Joe a fast and successful recovery,” Trump wrote.The relationship between Trump and Biden has been fraught with tension for years. Trump has frequently referred to Biden as “sleepy Joe” or “crooked Biden,” often questioning his physical and mental fitness due to his age. Many Republicans have also criticised Biden as unfit to have run for president, pushing instead for Kamala Harris to be the Democratic candidate.Despite the longstanding rivalry and political jabs, Trump extended his support on behalf of himself and the first lady, Melania Trump, to Biden and his family. This comes amid reports that Biden’s aggressive prostate cancer has spread to his bones, as confirmed by his office.Biden’s diagnosis followed medical tests prompted by urinary symptoms. During a routine physical exam, doctors found a small nodule on his prostate, leading to additional investigations. By Friday, it was confirmed that Biden has prostate cancer, which has already spread to his bones.

Did DOGE cuts cause Mexican ship’s deadly crash into Brooklyn Bridge? US senator makes wild claim: ‘Meddling by Trump...’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/did-doge-cuts-cause-mexican-ships-deadly-crash-into-brooklyn-bridge-us-senator-makes-wild-claim-meddling-by-trump-/articleshow/121254855.cms,"Background on the crash





US Senator Chuck Schumer on Sunday made a surprising claim that recent budget and staffing cuts by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to the US Coast Guard might have contributed to the deadly collision involving a Mexican tall ship crashing into the Brooklyn Bridge, reports the New York Post.Schumer pointed to what he described as Trump administration interfering in the work of the US Coast Guard and said the impact of these changes needed urgent investigation.“We know there has been meddling by the Trump administration into USCG staffing, and we need to know how this might have impacted the events of last night — from a command, communication and local coordination level,” he said in a press release.He also raised concerns about the Coast Guard’s Vehicle Traffic System, comparing it to an “FAA-like traffic control operation.” Schumer suggested this system might not have been “fully or adequately functional in light of a hiring freeze.” He warned, “If this were the case, the Brooklyn Bridge accident would be a national harbinger, demanding immediate attention.”However, there have been no reports of any other vessels being involved in the crash, which took place on Saturday evening.The Mexican navy training ship Cuauhtémoc lost steering due to a mechanical failure, which left it vulnerable to the East River’s currents. This caused the ship to collide with the Brooklyn Bridge, killing two navy cadets and injuring at least 17 others.The Coast Guard responded immediately to the incident.DOGE, led by billionaire Elon Musk and established earlier this year under Trump, has implemented significant budget and staffing cuts across various agencies, including the Coast Guard.Schumer, who has faced criticism for his recent political stances and poll numbers, has been under pressure for supporting a Trump-backed budget and avoiding questions about former President Joe Biden ’s mental health during his term.The Cuauhtémoc, a nearly 300-foot Mexican navy training ship carrying 277 people, collided with the Brooklyn Bridge around 8:30 pm on Saturday. The ship’s 147-foot masts struck the bridge’s roadway and broke. Two sailors were reportedly trapped atop the mast during the impact.The incident caused pandemonium, with 23 people injured and two dead, according to the NYPD. Eyewitnesses described chaotic scenes as sailors dangled from the rigging, some rescued after hanging for over 15 minutes.The vessel was preparing to leave New York for a goodwill tour to Iceland. The 142-year-old Brooklyn Bridge did not suffer major structural damage, but all lanes were briefly closed for inspection.The ship remained stuck under the bridge until a tugboat helped hold it in place. The Cuauhtémoc’s mast height is about 160 feet, while the bridge clearance at high tide is only 127 feet.","US Senator Chuck Schumer said recent budget and staffing cuts by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to the US Coast Guard might have contributed to the deadly collision.

Indian-origin Democratic Congressman Ro Khanna , who defended former US President Joe Biden during the 2024 campaign, admitted on Sunday that he was wrong to support Biden’s decision to run for re-election.Khanna said, ""I made a mistake,"" in judging Biden’s readiness for another term. However, the lawmaker insisted there was no cover-up regarding Biden's mental and physical decline before the election.Speaking to Jonathan Karl on ABC News' This Week, Khanna said while Biden had a strong record, those around him should explain their role in pushing the re-election bid.""I don't think it was a cover-up … but I do think that the advisers and people close to Joe Biden owe an explanation … What I don't think the Democratic Party can do is just say, 'Let's talk about the future. Let's move past this,'"" he said.Khanna was among those who had defended Biden’s physical and mental capacity to serve a second term. But on Sunday, he changed his stance, saying, ""Look I made a mistake … you have to own up before you can move forward.""Even as he admitted his mistake, Khanna praised Biden’s time in office, pointing to his work on economic recovery after Covid, clean energy investments, and boosting American manufacturing.""He's had a remarkable life. He showed a lot of resilience,"" Khanna said. ""I still think Joe Biden has a lot to be proud of in his record. The CHIPS Act to bring semiconductors back, the Inflation Reduction Act to set up clean tech, the fact that we got out of COVID in the economy and had a strong economic recovery. And he has had a lot of resilience in his life. That doesn't mean, though, that he made the right decision to seek a second term.""Khanna also spoke about the future of the Democratic Party, saying he was focused on helping the party win back the House of Representatives and connect with working-class voters ""I'm focused on getting the House back. All my travels are in the Republican swing districts … I'm focused on a Democratic Party really having a working-class economic agenda. I call it 'economic patriotism,'"" he said.Khanna also showed unexpected support for US President Donald Trump’s work to make a nuclear deal with Iran and send aid to Gaza.""I appreciate that he's trying to get peace there. Look, I supported President Obama when he did the deal with Iran, and those of us who supported that should support President Trump. I'm also glad that he's speaking out about getting aid into Gaza.""Furthermore, Khanna made it clear that he isn’t thinking about a presidential run in 2028.","Indian-origin Democratic Congressman Ro Khanna defended former US President Joe Biden during the 2024 campaign.

A 4.7-magnitude earthquake hit Pakistan's Swat district and nearby regions on Sunday, according to ARY News.The quake struck at a depth of 205 kilometres, with its epicentre in the Hindukush mountain range — a known seismic zone spanning parts of Afghanistan and northern Pakistan.Tremors were felt across several areas of Swat, including Mingora and its outskirts. Authorities confirmed there were no immediate reports of damage.Earlier, on May 12, a 4.9-magnitude earthquake had shaken Quetta, the capital of Balochistan.The National Seismic Monitoring Centre (NSMC) confirmed that the 4.9-magnitude tremors affected Quetta and neighbouring regions. The quake's epicentre was situated west of Quetta, according to NSMC data.The tremor came just two days after Pakistan was hit by two consecutive earthquakes on Saturday — a 5.7-magnitude quake in the morning and a 4.0-magnitude tremor later in the day, according to Reuters.Pakistan's geographical position makes it particularly vulnerable to seismic activity, as it sits at the intersection of the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates. The country's territory is traversed by numerous significant fault lines, resulting in frequent and potentially damaging earthquakes.","A 4.7-magnitude earthquake hit Pakistan's Swat district and nearby regions on Sunday.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan late Saturday revealed that it too would launch a diplomatic campaign led by foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari to present its narrative to the world. This comes after India announced it would dispatch seven all-party delegations to key capitals to brief global leaders on Operation Sindoor and its counter-terrorism efforts “I was contacted earlier today by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who requested that I lead a delegation to present Pakistan's case for peace on the international stage. I am honoured to accept this responsibility and remain committed to serving Pakistan in these challenging times,” Bhutto-Zardari wrote in a Facebook post on Saturday.However, there was no official confirmation of the campaign from the Pakistan government.The announcement follows India’s decision to send seven all-party delegations to key global capitals to brief foreign governments on its precision military strikes under Operation Sindoor. Launched on May 7 in response to the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack, the operation targeted nine terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Over 100 terrorists affiliated with groups like Jaish-e-Mohammed Lashkar-e-Taiba , and Hizbul Mujahideen were reportedly killed.Following the strikes, Pakistan retaliated with cross-border shelling and attempted drone incursions. In response, India launched secondary strikes targeting Pakistani military infrastructure, including radar systems and communication nodes.To consolidate international backing, union minister Kiren Rijiju announced that delegations led by prominent leaders such as Shashi Tharoor, Ravi Shankar Prasad, Sanjay Kumar Jha, Baijayant Panda, Kanimozhi Karunanidhi, Supriya Sule, and Shrikant Eknath Shinde will visit UN Security Council member states and strategic allies.“In moments that matter most, Bharat stands united. Seven All-Party Delegations will soon visit key partner nations, carrying our shared message of zero tolerance to terrorism .

Human rights violations in Sindh





Jeay Sindh Freedom Movement ( JSFM ), a political group advocating for Sindhu Desh, staged a peaceful sit-in protest on a highway in Pakistan on Friday, demanding the release of missing and jailed Sindhi nationalists. With traffic halted and slogans echoing through the air, the group sought global attention to enforced disappearances , illegal detentions, and human rights abuses in Sindh and Balochistan.JSFM leaders, including chairman Sohail Abro, Zubair Sindhi, and Amar Azadi, called for the immediate release of Zahid Channa, Sajad Channa, Adnan Baloch, Badshah Baloch, Rafiqat Manghanhar, and Shahid Soomro. They also demanded that false charges against them be withdrawn and that all forcibly arrested persons be freed.""This peaceful sit-in serves as a protest against the unlawful arrests of our nationalist activists, the abuses occurring in jails, and the enforced disappearances. Our effort is peaceful and democratic, and we will persist until our people are free,"" the collective statement read.The protestors warned the Hyderabad Jail authorities against further mistreatment of detainees and threatened to block the prison’s main gate if abuse continued.They also called out to international organisations like the UN, Amnesty International, and Human Rights Watch, urging intervention and global condemnation of Pakistan's rights violations.A 2022 US State Department report, had pointed out widespread cases of extrajudicial killings and the recovery of mutilated bodies across Sindh.In 2024, Abro had also appealed for help in the case of Priya Kumari, a missing Hindu girl, stressing rising cases of forced conversions and marriages to Muslim men.Sindhis have been historically struggling for identity and autonomy. They accuse the Pakistani state of erasing local culture through systemic oppression—citing Urdu imposition, the ‘One unit’ policy, and historic land grabs like the removal of Karachi from Sindh.Meanwhile, in related developments, Balochistan declared independence from Pakistan this week. On social media, hashtags like #RepublicOfBalochistan trended, with users sharing proposed flags and maps.","Jeay Sindh Freedom Movement (JSFM) staged a peaceful sit-in protest on a highway in Pakistan on Friday, demanding the release of missing and jailed Sindhi nationalists.

Pakistan’s high commissioner to Bangladesh, Syed Ahmed Maroof , has abruptly gone on leave after videos of his alleged honeytrap surfaced online, according to Bangladeshi daily Prothom Alo.Maroof left Dhaka on the morning of 11 May, travelling to Islamabad via Dubai. That same day, the Pakistan high commission in Dhaka formally notified Bangladesh’s ministry of foreign affairs of his departure, a senior ministry official told Prothom Alo on Tuesday.Diplomatic sources in Dhaka suggest that Maroof’s recall may be linked to controversy surrounding a personal visit to Cox’s Bazar during the recent India-Pakistan conflict, and his alleged association with a female Bangladeshi government official, Daily Sun reported.Under diplomatic protocol, when an ambassador takes leave, the host country’s foreign ministry is informed of the duration and who will assume responsibilities in the interim. While the Pakistan high commission confirmed that deputy high commissioner Muhammad Asif will serve as acting high commissioner, no timeframe for Maroof’s leave was provided in official communication, Prothom Alo noted.Maroof had played a high-profile role in Dhaka and Islamabad ties, particularly following the ousting of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s government on 5 August 2024, in the wake of a student-led uprising.Rumours of the scandal escalated after photos and alleged intimate videos surfaced online, showing Maroof with a Bangladeshi woman. This also led to speculation that the envoy had been honey-trapped.","Pakistan’s high commissioner to Bangladesh, Syed Ahmed Maroof, has abruptly gone on leave after videos of his alleged honeytrap surfaced online.

'Some teachers will buy pads for us'



Cloth pads can be unsafe



Government initiatives fall short



New vouchers expected this year







When 14-year-old Janani gets her period, she doesn't always make it to school. Some days, there are no sanitary pads at home, and Janani is forced to use a pad made from old clothes. On those days, she skips classes.""I feel ashamed of using cloth,"" Janani told DW. ""If we miss school because of this, they won't teach us again the lessons we've missed, will they?""A survey conducted by DW of more than 500 girls across six schools in Sri Lanka's Central Province indicated that nearly half — 46% — struggled to afford pads each month, with the figure skyrocketing to 81% at one school.Janani's mother works as a tea plucker in the hills of Nuwara Eliya District and earns about 1,350 rupees (around €4 or $4.5) per day. She buys her daughter pads when she can afford it. When she has no pads, Janani said, she wonders ""why I get my period at all.""Almost half of the girls surveyed by DW said they missed school during their period for a myriad of reasons, including excessive pain. And it is affecting their school performance.""I keep thinking about it, and so I can't study,"" said 14-year-old Girija referring to period poverty , a sentiment echoed by some of her peers.Sri Lanka's government is making an effort to address the problem as its economy inches towards recovery following an economic collapse in 2022.The cost of a pack of 10 sanitary napkins increased by 92% after the economic crisis, from 140 to 270 rupees, according to the Advocata Institute. Imported sanitary pads continue to be taxed in Sri Lanka at 51%.Teacher Anthonyraj Devaneshi told DW that her school gave out one sanitary pad to girls in emergency situations, but could not afford to give them out consistently.""Some teachers will buy pads for us, but others won't,"" said 12-year-old Harini, adding that she found it awkward to ask and would usually ask her friends to do it on her behalf. ""If my friends aren't at school [when I get my period], I'll just come home.""Harini has to make the long journey home by herself if her parents are unable to pick her up — a walk which takes her an hour through the hills.Her school also has no place for girls to dispose of their sanitary pads, with several girls telling DW they avoided changing at school. Two schools had a policy requiring students who took a pad from school to purchase a replacement and hand it in the next day.A 2021 study by Advocata revealed that half of Sri Lankan women did not spend any money on sanitary products.Rashmira Balasuriya, director of the Arka Initiative to combat period poverty and technical advisor to Sri Lanka's Family Planning Association, said the issue had ""most likely gotten worse"" following the COVID-19 pandemic and economic crisis.To save money, many girls use cloth. About 44% of the girls surveyed by DW reported using a combination of cloth and pads or exclusively cloth during their period, although not all of them cited unaffordability as the reason.Balasuriya said the lack of sunlight in Sri Lanka's hill country meant cloth pads were not always safe to use, because they would not properly dry.Girija told DW she had started using pads after developing an infection from cloth. ""Using cloth is hard. It feels like it's not secure,"" she said. ""I feel scared to sit because I'm worried something might happen. It's hard to walk, to sit, or to sleep.""At least a dozen other girls told DW they had also developed infections from using cloth.Girija said her family took out loans from the store to buy pads and she felt angry with her mother when they could not afford them. However, her mother told her, ""It doesn't matter if we have to use cloth, you use pads."" Still, Girija only changes her pad only once every seven hours, afraid of running out.""When we use cloth for too long, sometimes it burns,"" said 13-year-old Saraswathi, who sometimes uses cloth pads even at school, although she avoids changing for the entire day. ""It's difficult to walk with cloth, and my hips hurt.""Teacher Thiruchelvam Mangala Roobini said there was also a lack of awareness around menstruation, with many girls who lacked pads forced to bleed through their underwear, which they would then dispose of in the toilets.Last year, the Sri Lankan government distributed two vouchers of 600 rupees each to 800,000 schoolgirls, with the last disbursement given in September 2024. The goal of the scheme was to allow the girls to buy sanitary pads.But Balasuriya said the voucher system was ""not a sustainable one,"" as the average woman needs about 20 pads over five days in a single month, and the money was simply insufficient. Some girls told DW the pads they purchased had run out in one or two months.Roobini believes that many girls did not purchase sanitary pads with the vouchers, citing previous instances where shoe vouchers provided by the government had been used to purchase other necessities.One school principal told DW he was ""100% sure"" that the sanitary pad voucher had even been used to purchase alcohol.The current government, led by Anura Kumara Dissanayake, announced in March that it would spend 1.44 billion rupees on a similar initiative, distributing two vouchers of 720 rupees each to all menstruating schoolgirls.A representative from the Department of Education told DW the initiative would begin again at the end of May, but it was not possible to say whether it would continue after the two sets of voucher disbursements. The lawmakers have yet to decide on the issue.""If they give us pads continuously, it'll be good,"" 14-year-old Girija told DW. ""Then they won't run out, right? We can keep using them.""","Nearly half of Sri Lankan girls struggle to afford sanitary pads each month. The cost of a pack of 10 sanitary napkins increased by 92% after the economic crisis.

Yields under threat

Seeping salt



Resistant varieties







Katukurunda: A commando in an elite Sri Lankan police unit, Sameera Dilshan has an unusual mission, to reclaim farms poisoned by salt, a long-standing problem now accelerating due to climate change.Increasing salinity is slowly and steadily swallowing traditional rice paddies along the island's coastline, taking away the livelihood of generations of farmers.Two hours' drive south of the capital Colombo lies Katukurunda, one of the camps of the formidable Special Task Force (STF), created four decades ago to fight Tamil rebels.While his colleagues train for riot control under the humid heat of the nearby Indian Ocean, the 35-year-old non-commissioned officer and his ""commando-farmer"" team are hoeing, weeding and watering.Their goal? To grow coconut palms and a wide variety of fruits and vegetables in a paddy declared dead 40 years ago due to salt water contamination.""This plantation was launched in 2022 as part of a government initiative to improve food security,"" Dilshan said, with local authorities allocating land parcels.The method, known as sorjan, is similar to techniques used in Thailand and Indonesia.It reshapes flood-prone land by digging ponds where rice can be grown or fish raised, with more saline-tolerant coconut trees planted.Embankments around these ponds are used for more delicate crops.""We're tending to 360 coconut trees planted here... along with pumpkins, gourds and cucumbers,"" Dilshan said. ""In two and a half years, we'll know if it's a success or not.""""It's an efficient and climate-resilient production system that optimises land use and productivity, and increases farmers' profits,"" said Buddhi Marambe, from the University of Peradeniya.The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said in a 2024 report that saltwater from seas and oceans affects 10.7 percent of the Earth's land, making it uncultivable in some cases.It travels up rivers with the tides, seeps into soil through evaporation, and contaminates groundwater used for irrigation.Climate change, which dries out the soil, reduces water resources, or raises sea levels, is expected to increase the proportion of such ""salty"" land from 24 percent to 32 percent of the world's surface area by the end of the century, the FAO predicts.These trends ""threaten agricultural productivity and reduce crop yields in affected zones"", it warns.Sri Lanka is no exception.Marambe estimates that 223,000 hectares (551,000 acres), half of which are rice paddies, are impacted by salinity -- nearly eight percent of the country's total arable land.South of the pilot plantation lies the village of Parappuwa, surrounded by abandoned land.Here, just a few kilometres from the sea, only a few small areas of the paddy fields are still in use.""Everything is polluted by salt that comes up during high tide,"" said Gamini Piyal Wijesinghe, 46, a farmer's son who, after he left the army, went into the restaurant business instead.He pointed to a stream where 18 small dams were built to stop the seawater.""They weren't constructed properly,"" he said. ""The water seeps through.""Other former rice farmers have turned to cinnamon or rubber cultivation.""Cinnamon is doing fairly well, but our income has significantly dropped since we stopped growing rice,"" said W.D. Jayaratne, 50, head of the local farmers' association.The future is gloomy.""Salinity in the water is increasing and threatening our farmland,"" he added. ""There are also insects. Everywhere you look, there are problems.""In this district of Kalutara, local authorities are offering abandoned land to farmers to bring it back under cultivation, mostly with coconut trees.""We've already allocated 400 hectares and plan to increase that to 1,000 in the next two years,"" said district chief Janaka Gunawardana.""There's high demand for coconut. It will create income for our people.""In Katukurunda, Aruna Priyankara Perera, 55, was encouraged by the success of the STF farming experiment.""I got five acres (two hectares) next to my hotel to replicate the STF's project,"" he said in front of his freshly planted coconut and pumpkin field.""The land is free for two years, provided you can show it's being cultivated.""Rice, the local staple, is a top concern for the authorities.""Soil salinity is a major issue in Sri Lanka,"" Marambe said. ""We've successfully tested several promising rice varieties that are resistant to salinity and flooding.""The stakes are high.A recent study of the Bentota river estuary, in the island's southwest, found that half of local rice farmers had lost all their income due to saltwater contamination.Even more serious, Sri Lanka's food security is now under threat. The last rice harvest, from September to March, was the country's lowest since 2019.""If we don't all roll up our sleeves to bring salt-polluted land back into cultivation and production,"" Marambe said, ""the future will only get darker.""",Sri Lankan commando-farmer team aims to reclaim rice paddies poisoned by salt.

Funerals have been held in Myanmar for almost two dozen students and teachers alleged to have been killed in an airstrike on a local school by a ruling military jet fighter.Local resistance groups and independent media said Tuesday that 20 pupils and 2 teachers died in the attack on Ohe Htein Twin village, in Sagaing region's township of Tabayin, also known as Depayin. Their reports said that as many as 100 people were wounded.The dead students were from grades 2 to 11, with the youngest seven years old, according to the shadow National Unity Government, which serves as an umbrella organization for opponents of military ruleA member of a local resistance group fighting against army rule told The Associated Press that another student, who was severely injured in Monday's bombing, died Tuesday afternoon while undergoing medical treatment.The resistance fighter, who requested that neither he nor his group be named for fear of arrest by the military, said the incident occurred while more than 100 students were studying in a school in the village, which has about 500 houses. He denied that any resistance fighters were stationed in the village that was attacked.Sagaing has been a stronghold of armed resistance to army rule in Myanmar, and the military in recent years has stepped up airstrikes in their fight against resistance forces, which include the armed People's Defense Forces.The resistance has no effective defense against air attacks, which many reports say hit non-military targets.Myanmar has been in turmoil since the army's 2021 takeover ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, which led to nationwide peaceful protests that escalated into a durable armed resistance denying the army control of much of the country.A report Tuesday in the state-run Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper denied the army had carried out the airstrike, saying malicious media outlets were intentionally spreading fake information. The military's tight control over the media and the relative remoteness of many such incidents makes independent confirmation of what occurred difficult.The bodies of 18 of the victims, most of them under the age of 10 were buried Monday in two village cemeteries after hastily arranged funerals just a few hours after the bombing incident, the unidentified resistance fighter said.About 100 wounded people, both students and teachers, were being treated in regional hospitals as the village's clinic lacked adequate facilities. At least two victims have had to have limbs amputated, he added.A member of another resistance group, the White Depeyin People's Defence Force, also speaking on condition of anonymity, told the AP that the funerals concluded on Tuesday.A report on Tuesday by the human rights ministry of the national unity government said the jet fighter took off from an airbase in Meiktila township in the central region of Mandalay on Monday morning and deliberately attacked the school with two cluster bombs while students were preparing to sit for their exams.""All individuals implicated in the commanding, execution, or collusion of deliberate air strikes against innocent children, students, and educators shall be subject to stringent judicial repercussions,"" the group said in a separate statement. ""No avenue for impunity shall be permitted. Every responsible party will be pursued without respite, unequivocally identified, held accountable and subjected to stringent punitive measures under the full force of the law. ""The military has increasingly used airstrikes to counter the widespread armed struggle against its rule. More than 6,600 civilians are estimated to have been killed by security forces since the army's 2021 takeover, according to figures compiled by nongovernmental organizations.Airstrikes in Myanmar garnered increased attention recently when numerous reports deemed credible by the United Nations and human rights groups said that they continued to be carried out in the wake of Myanmar's devastating March 28 earthquake, after which the military and resistance groups declared ceasefires to facilitate relief efforts.""We are horrified by reports of a Myanmar regime airstrike on a school in an earthquake-affected area at a time when a ceasefire has been announced. Schools are meant to be a place of safety and opportunity, not collateral in a conflict,"" Britain's minister for Indo-Pacific catherine west said in a statement.""We repeat our call to all parties, particularly the Myanmar military, to refrain from airstrikes, safeguard civilians, and protect civilian infrastructure.""","Local resistance groups and independent media said 20 pupils and 2 teachers died in the attack. Their reports said that as many as 100 people were wounded. The dead students were from grades 2 to 11, with the youngest seven years old. State-run Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper denied the army had carried out the airstrike.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121164028,imgsize-1462892,width-400,resizemode-4/121164028.jpg"

Myanmar's ex-ambassador to London has been charged with trespass for refusing to leave his ambassadorial residence, police said Wednesday, after he was stripped of his post by the military junta following a 2021 coup. Kyaw Zwar Minn , 66, faces a charge of diplomatic trespass and will appear before a court on May 30, London's Metropolitan Police said.The case comes after diplomats close to the junta in April 2021 seized the embassy in central London. They refused access to Minn, a supporter of Aung San Suu Kyi's civilian government overthrown by a coup in February that year.Britain's Conservative government at the time indicated it would offer its protection to the ousted ambassador.The then British foreign minister, Dominic Raab, condemned ""the bullying actions of the Myanmar military regime in London"" and paid tribute to Kyaw Zwar Minn for his ""courage"".Minn's lawyer said after his client was questioned by police in 2023 that the residence remained the property of the Union of Myanmar.""My client has always maintained that he is more than happy to hand over the keys to a representative of the democratically elected government of Myanmar,"" he added.The 2021 coup plunged Myanmar into a conflict that has forced more than a million people to flee their homes, according to the United Nations, with thousands more arrested.Myanmar's relations with the United Kingdom, the former colonial power, have deteriorated sharply since the military seized power.It was not immediately clear if Minn was still living at the residence.","Myanmar's ex-ambassador to London charged with trespass for refusing to leave residence.

DHAKA: Pakistan's high commissioner to Bangladesh, Syed Ahmed Maroof , who has been notably active since the fall of the Sheikh Hasina govt, has taken sudden leave and departed Dhaka, prompting a wave of speculation in diplomatic circles and on social media.Maroof left Dhaka on May 11, travelling back to Islamabad via Dubai. On the same day, the Pakistan high commission in Dhaka officially notified Bangladesh's ministry of foreign affairs of his departure.

However, it has not disclosed the expected length of Maroof's leave in its formal communication.Maroof had played a prominent role in organising high-level visits, including that of Pakistan's foreign secretary, and has travelled extensively across Bangladesh, with his most recent visit to Cox's Bazar on May 9. Given his high-profile role, Maroof's abrupt departure has fuelled speculation about the reasons behind his leave.

UK judge flagged ‘confidential impediment’ blocking Nirav Modi’s extradition to India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-judge-flagged-confidential-impediment-blocking-nirav-modis-extradition-to-india/articleshow/121251255.cms,"PTI file photo





Nirav Modi’s extradition to India is being held up by a “confidential impediment,” according to a London High Court ruling issued this week, reported PTI. Justice Michael Fordham remarked while rejecting Modi’s latest bail application, noting that a legal barrier—whose details remain undisclosed—is stopping UK authorities from handing over the 54-year-old to India.Modi, who is wanted in India on charges of fraud, money laundering, and witness interference, has been in prison since March 2019. Although the UK government approved his extradition in 2021, the process has not moved forward. The judge said the confidential nature of the issue limits what the court can realistically assess, particularly when reviewing the long delay and the risk of granting bail.“There is a legal reason which relates to confidential proceedings,” Justice Fordham said. The court said that this information is known to Nirav Modi, his lawyers, and the Home Office—but not to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), the Indian authorities, or the court itself.CPS lawyer Nicholas Hearn, representing the Indian side, acknowledged the existence of the issue and said it must be respected, without disclosing further.The confidential matter is widely believed to involve an asylum application, but the court has not confirmed this.Meanwhile, Modi’s legal team argued for bail on health and humanitarian grounds, pointing to physical and mental deterioration and risks in prison. But the judge found that these concerns did not outweigh the likelihood that Modi would flee if released.There are three ongoing criminal cases against Nirav Modi in India, including one by the CBI over fraud linked to Punjab National Bank, another by the Enforcement Directorate for money laundering, and a third for interfering with witnesses. All bail attempts so far have been denied.","Nirav Modi is wanted in India on charges of fraud, money laundering, and witness interference.

Poll Do you agree with Elton John's statement that the UK government is being 'absolute losers' regarding copyright law changes? Yes, I completely agree. No, I disagree.





LONDON: British pop legend Elton John branded the UK government ""absolute losers"" on Sunday over planned copyright law changes that would hand exemptions to tech firms.In a blistering interview broadcast by the BBC, ""Rocket Man"" star John said he felt ""incredibly betrayed"" and accused the government of preparing to ""rob young people of their legacy and their income"".The changes which he branded ""criminal"" would allow tech firms to use creators' content freely unless the rights holders opt out.But John, 78, who has sold over 300 million records worldwide in his decades-long career, said young artists did not have the resources ""to fight big tech"".He said he was not against artificial intelligence (AI) but that when it came to music and creativity a line should be drawn.The government's Data (Use and Access) Bill is currently going through parliament.The parliament's upper house supported an amendment designed to ensure copyright holders would have to give permission over whether their work was used and, in turn, see what elements had been taken, by who and when.But on Wednesday MPs in the lower house, in which the Labour government has a huge majority, voted down the changes.If the government's planned changes to copyright laws went ahead they would be ""committing theft, thievery on a high scale"", John told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme.""The government are just being absolute losers and I'm very angry about it,"" John said, blasting Technology Secretary Peter Kyle as a ""bit of a moron"".Prime Minister Keir Starmer has previously said the government needs to ""get the balance right"" with copyright and AI while noting that the technology represented ""a huge opportunity"".""They have no right to sell us down the river,"" John added, urging Starmer to ""wise up"" and ""see sense"".More than 1,000 musicians including Kate Bush, Annie Lennox and Damon Albarn released a silent album in February to protest at the proposed changes, saying they would legalise music theft.Earlier this month, writers and musicians including John and Bush also condemned the proposals as a ""wholesale giveaway"" to Silicon Valley in a letter to The Times newspaper.Other signatories included musicians Paul McCartney, Ed Sheeran, Dua Lipa and Sting, and writers Kazuo Ishiguro, Michael Morpurgo and Helen Fielding.A Department for Science, Innovation and Technology spokesperson said the bill was focused on ""unlocking the secure and effective use of data for the public interest -- boosting the economy by an estimated £10 billion over the course of the next 10 years"".","British pop legend brands UK government 'absolute losers' over planned copyright law changes.

British mountaineer Kenton Cool on Sunday morning climbed Mount Everest for the 19th time, setting a new record for the most ascents of the world’s highest peak by a non-Sherpa climber.The 51-year-old was reported to be in good health while descending, confirmed Iswari Paudel of Himalayan Guides Nepal , which managed the expedition, according to agency AP.Cool, from Gloucestershire in southwest England, first summited Everest in 2004 and has since scaled the 8,849-metre (29,032-foot) mountain nearly every year.His climbing schedule was interrupted only in 2014, 2015, and 2020, years when Everest expeditions were either cancelled due to deadly avalanches or the Covid-19 pandemic.The accomplished climber was accompanied by Dorji Gyaljen Sherpa, who completed his 23rd ascent during the same climb, reported The Himalayan Times.They reached the summit around 9:15 am, using the standard Southeast Ridge route pioneered by Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay in 1953.Cool's achievement was widely celebrated in the climbing community. Adrian Ballinger of US-based Alpenglow Expeditions was quoted by Reuters as saying, “His experience, charisma, and strength make him a valuable part of the Everest community.He’s just a great person to share stories from two decades on the mountain.”While Cool holds the record among non-Sherpa climbers, Nepali legend Kami Rita Sherpa remains the overall record holder with 30 Everest summits and is currently on the mountain aiming for another, according to AP.Nepal, which hosts eight of the world’s 14 highest peaks, has issued 468 Everest climbing permits this season, each costing $11,000, as per Reuters.The current spring window is the most popular for Everest expeditions, typically closing at the end of May before the monsoon season begins.Cool has also achieved other milestones in high-altitude climbing.In 2013, he became the first British mountaineer to summit Mt Nuptse, Mt Everest, and Mt Lhotse in a single season.

State threats







LONDON: Three Iranian nationals have appeared in court in London charged with suspected espionage for Iran's intelligence services, UK police said, as the government vowed to boost national security powers.The charges come amid heightened concerns about Iranian activities on UK soil.Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said following the charges that ""Iran must be held to account for its actions"".""We must also strengthen our powers to protect our national security as we will not tolerate growing state threats on our soil,"" she said.The three were all remanded in custody following a hearing at Westminster Magistrates' Court in central London.They were arrested on May 3 in what the capital's Metropolitan police called ""a very complex and fast-moving investigation"", and were due to appear in a London court later on Saturday.They were named as Mostafa Sepahvand, 39, Farhad Javadi Manesh, 44, and Shapoor Qalehali Khani Noori, 55, all with addresses in London.The alleged spying activity took place from August 2024 to February 2025, according to police who confirmed that Iran was the country.""These are extremely serious charges under the National Security Act, which have come about following what has been a very complex and fast-moving investigation,"" said Dominic Murphy, head of the Met's Counter-Terrorism command.""Since the men were arrested two weeks ago, detectives have been working around the clock,"" he added.All three were charged with ""engaging in conduct likely to assist a foreign intelligence service between 14 August 2024 and 16 February 2025,"" the police said.""The foreign state to which the charges relate is Iran,"" the police said in their statement.Sepahvand was also charged with ""surveillance, reconnaissance and open-source research... intending to commit acts, namely serious violence against a person in the United Kingdom.""Manesh and Noori were also charged with ""surveillance and reconnaissance with the intention that acts, namely serious violence against a person in the United Kingdom, would be committed by others.""A fourth man was arrested on May 9 as part of the investigation, but has now been released without charge, the police added in their statement.The National Security Act gives law enforcement greater powers to disrupt ""state threats"" including foreign interference and espionage.In March, Iran became the first country to be placed on an enhanced tier of the Foreign Influence Registration Scheme (FIRS), which aims to boost the UK's national security against covert foreign influences.The measures, due to come into place later this year, will mean that all people working inside the UK for Iran, its intelligence services or the Revolutionary Guard would have to register or face jail.Five Iranian nationals were also arrested on May 3 in connection with an entirely separate investigation, with four of them remaining in custody after warrants of further detention were secured.The four were arrested on suspicion of preparation of a terrorist act, contrary to section five of the Terrorism Act 2006.A fifth was bailed to an unspecified date in May.","Three Iranian nationals have appeared in court in London charged with suspected espionage for Iran's intelligence services.

Billionaires in retreat





King Charles III and former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak have found themselves side by side, not in politics, but in pounds. Both are now worth an estimated £640 million, earning them the 238th spot on the 2025 Sunday Times Rich List , released Friday.The list, which tracks Britain’s 350 wealthiest individuals and families, reveals a dramatic reshuffling at the top, and signs of financial turbulence rippling through the elite.At 76, King Charles climbed 20 spots from last year, buoyed in part by surging profits from Crown Estate wind farm deals, which doubled returns and boosted the sovereign grant that funds royal activities. Still, most royal assets, including Buckingham Palace, remain off the books as they’re owned “in the right of the Crown,” not personally. His private wealth includes the Balmoral and Sandringham estates, along with an investment portfolio inherited from Queen Elizabeth II.Meanwhile, Sunak’s political exit hasn’t dented his bank balance too much. The former PM has taken up a part-time role at Stanford University and joined the lucrative Washington Speakers Bureau. His wife, Akshata Murty, continues to draw dividends from Infosys, £7.5 million last year, though the tech stock’s recent slide shaved off some value.Despite this, the couple’s fortunes rose just enough to push them up from last year’s 245th place.The Hinduja family holds the crown at the top for a fourth straight year, with an estimated £35.3 billion, even after a £2 billion dip. They’re followed by another Indian-born duo, David and Simon Reuben, who climbed to No. 2 with £26.87 billion.Lakshmi Mittal, the steel magnate behind ArcelorMittal, remains at No. 8 with £15.44 billion, while Anil Agarwal of Vedanta Resources sits at No. 25 with £7.5 billion. Also on the list: Prakash Lohia (No. 31, £6.02 bn), Mohsin and Zuber Issa of Asda and EG Group (No. 32, £6 bn), and Navin and Varsha Engineer (No. 48, £3.45 bn). The Arora brothers and Lord Swraj Paul are also among the top 100.But not everyone’s raking it in. The 2025 list saw the sharpest fall in billionaire numbers in its 37-year history, down to 156 from 165 last year.“This was one of the toughest editions to compile,” said list compiler Robert Watts, blaming Donald Trump’s tariffs and market volatility. “It’s the third straight year of collective wealth decline, and the biggest drop in UK billionaires we’ve ever recorded.”In an increasingly shaky economy, it seems even the richest aren’t immune. But for now, wind farms, Indian billionaires, and a former PM on the lecture circuit are holding their ground.","The Hinduja family holds the crown at the top for a fourth straight year, with an estimated £35.3 billion.

Author Salman Rushdie attacker sentenced to 25 years in prison in 2022 stabbing case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/author-salman-rushdie-attacker-sentenced-to-25-years-in-prison-in-2022-stabbing-case/articleshow/121216239.cms,"



The man who stabbed acclaimed author Salman Rushdie on stage during a 2022 lecture in western New York has been sentenced to 25 years in prison. Hadi Matar , 27, was convicted in February of attempted murder and assault after attacking Rushdie as he prepared to speak at the Chautauqua Institution The brutal assault left Rushdie, 77, blind in one eye and seriously injured. He was stabbed over a dozen times in the head and torso. Matar also wounded another man on stage. Though Rushdie did not attend Friday’s sentencing, he submitted a victim impact statement. He had previously testified, recounting the harrowing moment he believed he was going to die.Before sentencing, Matar made a brief statement criticizing Rushdie and invoking free speech, calling the author a “hypocrite.” He received the maximum penalty: 25 years for the attack on Rushdie and seven years for injuring the other victim. The sentences will run concurrently, as both injuries occurred during the same incident, said Chautauqua County District Attorney Jason Schmidt.Schmidt argued that Matar had deliberately planned the attack to cause maximum harm — not just to Rushdie, but to the audience of over 1,400 people present.Defense attorney Nathaniel Barone countered that Matar had no prior criminal record and suggested a lighter sentence of 12 years, arguing the audience members were not direct victims.Rushdie spent nearly five weeks in hospitals and rehabilitation centers following the attack. He later detailed his recovery in his 2024 memoir, Knife.Matar, a U.S. citizen from New Jersey, is also facing a federal trial on terrorism charges. Prosecutors say the stabbing was an attempt to carry out a decades-old fatwa issued in 1989 by Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini after the publication of Rushdie’s controversial novel, The Satanic Verses. The fatwa, which called for Rushdie’s death, was condemned internationally, though Iran later said it would no longer enforce it.According to prosecutors, Matar believed the edict was still valid and claimed it had been reaffirmed by Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in 2006. Matar has pleaded not guilty to federal charges of providing material support to terrorists and committing terrorism that crosses national boundaries.Video evidence shown during the state trial captured the moment of the attack. Matar is seen approaching Rushdie from behind and stabbing him repeatedly as the audience screamed. The two struggled on stage before being separated by onlookers.Jurors reached their guilty verdict after less than two hours of deliberation.","Hadi Matar, 27, was convicted in February of attempted murder and assault after attacking Rushdie as he prepared to speak at the Chautauqua Institution.

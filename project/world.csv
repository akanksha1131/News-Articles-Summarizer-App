Why is Trump admin giving $5 million amount to family of January 6 rioter Ashli Babbitt,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-administration-settles-30-million-lawsuit-awards-5-million-to-family-of-january-6-rioter-ashli-babbitt/articleshow/121281585.cms,"Micki Witthoeft, center, mother of Ashli Babbitt (File photo AP)





The Trump administration has agreed to pay around $5 million to the family of Ashli Babbitt, in order to settle a $30 million wrongful death lawsuit filed by Babbitt estate, according to Associated Press. She was shot and killed during Capitol ill riots on January 6, 2021.Babbitt was attempting to breach her way into the US house speaker at the time, Nancy Pelosi, when the Trump supporter was shot dead by a capital police officer, which on investigation was determined as an act of self-defence and defence of members of Congress.The prosecutors said earlier this month in a hearing that the settlement agreement has been reached, though the details of it were not made public back then. On May 2, lawyers for Babbitt's estate and the justice department told a federal judge that they had reached a settlement in principle but were still working out the details before a final agreement could be signed.The lawsuit alleges that Ashli(35), an air force veteran, was unarmed when she was shot, and the police officer failed to de-escalate the situation and give any warning command before opening fire. It also accuses Capitol police of negligence, that the department should have known that the officer was ""prone to behave in a dangerous or otherwise incompetent manner.""In April 2021, US Attorney’s office for the District of Columbia absolved the officer of any wrongdoing, and that no federal law was broken. The justice department determined that there was “no evidence to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the officer willfully” used unlawful or unreasonable force.The settlement has received criticism from multiple quarters as well.In a statement on Monday, Capitol police chief Tom Manger said he was “extremely disappointed and disagrees with this settlement.”“In 2021, the DOJ investigation determined no wrongdoing by police. This settlement sends a chilling message to law enforcement nationwide, especially to those with a protective mission like ours,” Manger said.House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, referred to the deal as a “slap in the face” of American people.The Democratic leader said that the settlement was “totally done without any communication to the chief of the Capitol police or his lawyers, and appears solely the result of a political determination that Donald Trump and Republicans are going to try to whitewash what happened on January 6.“This settlement is just an extension of what they’ve previously done, which is to pardon violent felons who violently attacked the Capitol on January 6, including police officers, and now have all been pardoned and sent back to communities across the country where in some cases they’re re-engaging in criminal activity,” he added.After President Donald Trump addressed his January 6 “Stop the Steal” rally, a mob of thousands stormed the Capital, more than 100 police officers were injured in the attack.In January, on his first day back in the White House, Trump pardoned, commuted the prison sentences or ordered the dismissal of charges for all of the more than 1,500 people charged with crimes in the riot.","The Trump administration has agreed to pay around $5 million to the family of Ashli Babbitt, in order to settle a $30 million wrongful death lawsuit.

'No one is above law': Democratic Rep. LaMonica McIver charged with assault after ICE facility confrontation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/no-one-is-above-law-democratic-rep-lamonica-mciver-charged-with-assault-after-ice-facility-confrontation/articleshow/121279845.cms,"Congresswoman Rep. LaMonica McIver demands the release of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka after his arrest while protesting outside an ICE detention prison, Friday, May 9, 2025, in Newark, N.J, (AP Image)

McIver calls her arrest 'purely political,' says ICE agents created 'unnecessary and unsafe confrontation'







The acting New Jersey US attorney on Monday said that she is charging Democratic Rep. LaMonica McIver with assault for allegedly confronting law enforcement officers outside a Newark immigration detention facility.Acting New Jersey US Attorney Alina Habba announced the criminal charges on social media, stating, ""Today my office has charged Congresswoman McIver with violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 111(a)(1) for assaulting, impeding and interfering with law enforcement.""Video evidence shows McIver's confrontation with ICE agents outside the facility.The incident occurred at the Delaney Hall Detention Centre on May 9, where several Democratic lawmakers were present. During the event, Democratic Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested for allegedly trespassing at the facility, which maintains contracts with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.Habba explained that she attempted to resolve the situation without pressing charges. ""I have persistently made efforts to address these issues without bringing criminal charges and have given Representative McIver every opportunity to come to a resolution, but she unfortunately declined,"" she stated.""No one is above the law – politicians or otherwise,"" the US attorney added. ""It is the job of this office to uphold justice impartially, regardless of who you are.""""Now we will let the justice system work.""The homeland security department released a video spanning nearly two minutes, showing McIver on the facility's side of a chain link fence before the mayor's arrest. The footage captures her passing through the gate and joining others in shouting ""surround the mayor"". In the crowded scene, her elbows make contact with an officer wearing a face covering and olive green uniform marked ""Police"".Reacting to the charges, McIver, who claimed that she went with her colleagues to inspect the treatment of ICE detainees at Delaney Hall, said that it was the ICE who created an ""unnecessary and unsafe confrontation"" when they chose to arrest Mayor Baraka.""Earlier this month, I joined my colleagues to inspect the treatment of ICE detainees at Delaney Hall in my district. We were fulfilling our lawful oversight responsibilities, as members of Congress have done many times before, and our visit should have been peaceful and short. Instead, ICE agents created an unnecessary and unsafe confrontation when they chose to arrest Mayor Baraka,"" she said.""The charges against me are purely political—they mischaracterize and distort my actions, and are meant to criminalize and deter legislative oversight. This administration will never stop me from working for the people in our district and standing up for what is right. I am thankful for the outpouring of support I have received and I look forward to the truth being laid out clearly in court,"" she added.Meanwhile, Paul Fishman, McIver's counsel and former US attorney for New Jersey, denounced the charges against her as ""spectacularly inappropriate"". He emphasised that she visited Delaney Hall to fulfil her congressional duties of monitoring ICE's detainee treatment.Fishman stated that ICE agents transformed a potentially peaceful situation into disorder. He asserted that this prosecution attempts to deflect ICE's conduct onto Congresswoman McIver, emphasising that factual evidence, not media coverage, would be decisive in court.","Democratic Rep.

DAKAR: A special court in Senegal on Monday formally charged a former government minister with embezzling Covid funds, a source close to the case told AFP.Salimata Diop, who was the minister for women under ex-president Macky Sall, is one of five former ministers facing allegation of corruption including the misuse of funds intended to fight the pandemic.Diop was charged with complicity in embezzlement and released after paying bail of about $97,750, the source said, confirming local media reports.Her parliamentary immunity from prosecution had been lifted on May 2 to allow the proceedings to go ahead.Diop is under investigation alongside the former ministers for community development, mines, industrial development and justice.Former minister for community development Amadou Mansour Faye is accused of diverting about $4.5 million from a fund set up to fight the Covid-19 pandemic in the west African nation in 2020-21, according to a national assembly report.Senegal's national assembly had earlier this month voted to order a special court to investigate the five former ministers.President Bassirou Diomaye Faye won an election last year vowing to crack down on corruption, particularly by the previous administration under Sall.Senegal's opposition has called the case a ""witchhunt"".","Salimata Diop was the minister for women under ex-president Macky Sall.

Labor impacts







WASHINGTON: When armed immigration agents made a surprise visit earlier this month to Pupatella , a trendy pizzeria in the US capital's Dupont neighborhood, they may not have made any arrests, but they delivered a clear message.The show of force, part of an ""enhanced operation"" by President Donald Trump's hardline administration, has had ripple effects through an industry reliant on immigrant labor, owners and others in the sector say.The agents asked to see employment eligibility forms known as I-9s, said Natasha Neely, vice president of Pupatella, which has several locations in the Washington area.""They did not have a warrant, and they did not have any form of paperwork, so they were turned away,"" she told AFP.A few hours later, agents showed up at Pupatella's Capitol Hill location, this time with a ""notice of inspection,"" Neely said. The manager referred them to the restaurant's corporate office.The immigration and customs enforcement (ICE) agency said it had arrested 189 undocumented migrants after handing out 187 such notices in the Washington area between May 6 and May 9.In a press release, it described the activity as an ""enhanced targeted immigration enforcement operation focusing on criminal alien offenders.""While the inspection notices are not unusual, Neely said, they are normally delivered by e-mail due to their administrative nature.""We have never experienced anything like this,"" she said, expressing confusion about why the restaurant had been targeted.Trump has made deporting undocumented immigrants a key priority for his second term, after successfully campaigning against an alleged ""invasion"" by criminals.So far, his administration has deported tens of thousands of migrants, with US courts hearing cases on allegations that the government violated due process in certain cases.Undocumented migrants are ""the backbone of our industry. From top to bottom,"" Shawn Townsend, president of the Restaurant Association Metropolitan Washington (RAMW), told AFP.In addition to the restaurant industry, immigrant labor plays a crucial role in many sectors of the economy, including agriculture and construction.Before Trump's inauguration in January, RAMW knew immigration enforcement ""was going to be a priority of the incoming administration, and so we held our first I-9 training workshop,"" said Townsend.One restaurant owner, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he felt threatened when immigration agents recently visited his establishment.""I'm going to see what the repercussions of that are. Basically, I don't know whether they're going to fine me forever or try to put me in jail,"" he said.According to a survey by employment law firm Littler Mendelson, 58 percent of executives said they were concerned Trump's anti-immigration policies would create labor shortages.The manufacturing and hospitality sectors were the most concerned.Since his restaurant was visited, the owner who requested anonymity said ""anyone who had any questions about their eligibility to work has left.""""They were advised by advocates... to basically just lay low, not come into work.""Townsend said that the ""political climate"" and economic challenges facing small businesses were likely combining to raise anxiety among restaurant workers.Increased immigration enforcement, as during Trump's first term in office, ""creates a scenario where (staff) may not return to work,"" he said.Neely said employees at Pupatella were startled by the surprise ICE visit, but that the restaurant was taking steps to address the situation.""We've made sure all of the managers know what the restaurants' rights are and what each team member's rights are,"" she said.Nevertheless, the raids do have a chilling effect.""Let's be honest, if anyone shows up at any location in a federal uniform with guns and vests... that's unnerving.""","Armed immigration agents made a surprise visit to Pupatella, a trendy pizzeria in Washington.

'Mass casualty event' declared as tornadoes hit Kentucky and Missouri





A fresh wave of deadly tornadoes swept across the central United States over the weekend, killing at least 28 people and injuring dozens more, with Kentucky and Missouri bearing the brunt of the destruction.The storms, which struck on Friday night, are part of what officials described as an unusually violent spring season.According to The New York Times, Kentucky alone reported 19 deaths, with 17 of them in Laurel County. Governor Andy Beshear confirmed that three of the 10 hospitalised victims remain in critical condition.One of those killed was Major Leslie Leatherman, a veteran firefighter who died during emergency operations. The Laurel County Fire Department called his death “a heartbreaking reminder of the dangers our first responders face every day.”The town of Kentucky’s London, was among the hardest-hit areas. Families picked through piles of wreckage and debris over the weekend. Residents like Jeff Wyatt barely escaped as their homes were torn apart. “It happened so fast… If we would have been there 10 seconds longer, we would have been gone with the family room,” Wyatt was quoted as saying by AP.Emergency management officials noted the storms were caused by a line of supercells, long-lasting, intense thunderstorms, which spun off at least 26 tornadoes across Indiana, Kentucky, Illinois, and Missouri.Chad Jenkins, emergency director for Brown County, Indiana, was quoted by NYT as saying, “We’ve been under almost a continuous stream of storms. It’s been a pretty turbulent spring for us.”Missouri recorded seven deaths, including five in St Louis, where Mayor Cara Spencer said about 5,000 buildings were damaged. “I would describe this as one of the worst storms in the city's history,” she said during a Saturday news conference.The storm system also caused fatalities in Virginia, where two people were killed by falling trees, and injured more than a dozen in Indiana.In Kentucky’s London, Ryan VanNorstran, who was house-sitting during the storm, described hearing screaming and feeling the house shake as windows shattered and debris flew. “I’d never really felt that kind of power from just nature,” he was quoted as saying by AP.Federal aid was approved for 24 Kentucky counties just two days before the latest disaster struck.However, as per NYT, recent staff cuts at National Weather Service offices, including a 29% vacancy rate in Louisville, have raised concerns about the country’s disaster response capabilities. Experts warn that vacancy rates above 20% can severely impact emergency preparedness.Despite the staffing shortfalls, Governor Beshear praised federal efforts in the immediate aftermath, saying on X, “Politics has no place in responding to natural disasters like this one.”The National Weather Service has warned that more dangerous weather could hit the region in the coming days, with forecasts of large hail and strong winds across the southern Great Plains, including parts of Oklahoma and Texas.Approximately 1,200 tornadoes hit the US every year, which have been reported in all 50 states over the years. Researchers found in 2018 that deadly tornadoes were happening less frequently in the traditional “Tornado Alley” of Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas and more frequently in parts of the more densely populated and tree-filled mid-South.","Mass casualty event declared as tornadoes hit Kentucky and Missouri.

BREAKING: Biden diagnosed with ‘aggressive’ prostate cancer





Leaders from across the political spectrum have come together in support of former US President Joe Biden after his office announced on Sunday that he has been diagnosed with aggressive prostate cancer.The 82-year-old was diagnosed on Friday following tests that found a prostate nodule.The cancer has metastasized to the bone and carries a Gleason score of 9, indicating one of the most severe forms. However, the cancer is hormone-sensitive, which allows for “effective management,” his office said in a statement.The announcement prompted a rare moment of unity in American politics, as tributes and well-wishes flooded in from Republicans and Democrats alike.“Melania and I are saddened to hear about Joe Biden’s recent medical diagnosis. We extend our warmest and best wishes to Jill and the family, and we wish Joe a fast and successful recovery,” US President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social.Former US Vice President Kamala Harris expressed her support on X, writing, “Joe is a fighter — and I know he will face this challenge with the same strength, resilience, and optimism that have always defined his life and leadership.”Former US President Barack Obama, under whom Biden served as vice president, said via social media, “Nobody has done more to find breakthrough treatments for cancer in all its forms than Joe, and I am certain he will fight this challenge with his trademark resolve and grace.”Republican lawmakers also extended their support. “This is certainly sad news,” said house speaker Mike Johnson, adding that he and his family were praying for Biden.Georgia Rep Marjorie Taylor Greene, whose father died of cancer in 2021, wrote, “Prayers for Joe Biden and his family.”Democratic leaders joined in with heartfelt tributes. Former house speaker Nancy Pelosi said Biden is “a great American patriot” and that she and her husband Paul were “praying for him to have strength and a swift recovery.”California Governor Gavin Newsom said, “A man of dignity, strength, and compassion like his deserves to live a long and beautiful life.”Senator Tim Kaine said Americans would be “with them every step of the way.”Public figures also offered personal reflections. Meghan McCain, whose father Senator John McCain died from brain cancer, wrote, “Cancer is the absolute worst... I don’t believe times like these are appropriate for politics.”Former US secretary of state Hillary Clinton added, “I’m thinking of the Bidens as they take on cancer, a disease they’ve done so much to try to spare other families from.”Piers Morgan took aim at social media users mocking Biden’s condition, writing, “Show some bloody respect.”Former Biden spokesperson TJ Ducklo, who is also battling cancer, tweeted, “Cancer has no f***ing idea who it’s dealing with. Betting against Biden has never been and still remains a bad f***ing bet.”Several others—Senators Susan Collins, Thom Tillis, Mike Lee, Peter Welch, John Fetterman; Governors Wes Moore and JB Pritzker; and Representatives Ro Khanna, Shontel Brown, Eric Swalwell, Jasmine Crockett, Chuck Edwards and more—offered their thoughts and prayers.Biden's diagnosis comes after he experienced urinary symptoms. The cancer’s aggressive nature, Grade Group 5 with bone metastasis, means it’s “very treatable, but not curable,” news agency AP quoted Dr Matthew Smith of Massachusetts General Brigham Cancer Center, as saying.Biden is reportedly reviewing treatment options with his physicians.Biden’s fight against cancer has been personal. His son Beau died of brain cancer in 2015. In 2022, Biden relaunched the “cancer moonshot” with the goal of halving cancer deaths over the next 25 years.","Former US President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with aggressive prostate cancer.

Who is Ryo Tatsuki – Japan’s ‘New Baba Vanga’

New Baba Vanga’s prediction for July 2025

Tourism hit as ‘New Baba Vanga’ warning triggers mass cancellations

Official warnings and government response

Social media buzz and public reaction





A Japanese manga artist known for her unsettlingly accurate predictions has sparked widespread concern, leading to a surge in travel cancellations to Japan. Ryo Tatsuki , often referred to as Japan's ""New Baba Vanga,"" has captured global attention for her chilling forecasts, including a major disaster anticipated for July 2025. With a track record that reportedly includes predictions of the devastating 2011 Tohoku earthquake and the death of iconic figures, Tatsuki’s latest prophecy has left travelers reconsidering their plans.The impact of her warning is already being felt in the travel industry, with agencies reporting significant drops in bookings as the feared date approaches. Here, you can explore Tatsuki's predictions, her history of accurate foresight, and the response from concerned travelers.Ryo Tatsuki is a Japanese manga artist whose prophetic claims have drawn comparisons to the late Bulgarian mystic Baba Vanga, known for her eerily accurate predictions about global events. Tatsuki first gained attention in 1999 with the release of her book ""The Future I Saw,"" a compilation of visions she claims to have experienced over the years. While the book initially received little mainstream attention, several of Tatsuki’s predictions have reportedly come true, earning her a devoted following in Japan and beyond.Among her most notable forecasts is the catastrophic March 2011 earthquake and tsunami that struck Japan’s northern Tohoku region. This disaster, which claimed over 18,000 lives and triggered the Fukushima nuclear crisis, occurred in the same month and year Tatsuki had predicted. Her book also allegedly foresaw the 1995 Kobe earthquake and the death of legendary Queen frontman Freddie Mercury, adding to her reputation as a modern-day seer.In a revised edition of ""The Future I Saw,"" published in 2021, Tatsuki issued a stark warning about a potentially catastrophic event set to strike in July 2025. According to CNN and other media reports, Tatsuki’s prophecy describes a massive undersea rupture forming between Japan and the Philippines, capable of generating tsunamis three times the height of those seen during the 2011 Tohoku disaster.Her prediction includes unsettling imagery of Japan’s oceans “boiling,” which some interpret as a possible reference to an underwater volcanic eruption or a massive seismic event. The epicenter of this anticipated disaster is drawn as a diamond-shaped region connecting Japan, Indonesia, Taiwan, and the Northern Mariana Islands – a part of the Pacific known for its intense geological activity.Reports indicate that Tatsuki’s prophecy has already started to influence travel behavior, particularly among tourists planning to visit Japan in the coming months. According to Hong Kong-based travel agency WWPKG, bookings to Japan dropped by as much as 50 percent during the recent Easter break, a trend expected to continue as the feared date draws closer.Speaking to CNN, CN Yuen, managing director of WWPKG, noted that concerns over Tatsuki’s prediction have been compounded by recent advisories from the Chinese embassy in Tokyo. In a statement issued in April 2025, the embassy warned Chinese nationals in Japan to remain vigilant against potential natural disasters, further fueling anxiety among travelers.The Chinese government’s warning was reportedly prompted by a series of recent seismic events and increased volcanic activity around Japan’s coastline. The South China Morning Post reported that the advisory urged residents and tourists to “take extra precautions against natural disasters,” a statement that many interpreted as an indirect acknowledgment of the growing fears surrounding Tatsuki’s prediction.Japanese authorities, however, have been more reserved in their response, focusing on reassuring the public about the country’s extensive disaster preparedness infrastructure. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) has not issued any specific alerts related to the July 2025 timeframe, emphasizing that its seismic monitoring systems remain among the most advanced in the world.Social media platforms have become hotbeds of speculation and debate, with the hashtag #July2025Prediction trending across multiple countries. Some users have expressed deep concern, while others have dismissed the claims as mere coincidence or sensationalism. Online forums dedicated to earthquake preparedness have also seen a surge in activity, with members sharing safety tips and evacuation plans in case of a worst-case scenario.","Ryo Tatsuki, often referred to as Japan's ""New Baba Vanga,"" has predicted a major disaster for July 2025.

WASHINGTON: In Joe Biden's family, there's a saying that the three worst words anyone can hear are ""you have cancer."" One decade ago, his son Beau died from a brain tumour. Several years later, his wife Jill had two cancerous lesions removed in her own brush with the disease.Now it is the former president's turn. Biden's office disclosed his prostate cancer diagnosis over the weekend, saying it has already spread to his bones.Although the cancer can possibly be controlled with treatment, it is no longer curable. The announcement is a bitter revelation that a disease that has brought so much tragedy to Biden's life could be what ends it.""Cancer touches us all,"" Biden wrote on social media. ""Like so many of you, Jill and I have learned that we are strongest in the broken places.""Even before the diagnosis, Biden's post-presidency was shadowed by questions about his health and whether he should have run for reelection.As questions about his fitness for office mounted, he abandoned the campaign, and Donald Trump retook the presidency by defeating Kamala Harris. As the 82-year-old Biden works to safeguard his damaged political legacy, he'll also be fighting a disease that shaped the final chapters of his decades-long career.Biden was serving as Barack Obama's vice president when Beau died in 2015. He decided not to seek the Democratic nomination the following year, which helped clear a path for Hillary Clinton, who lost to Trump in 2016.Valerie Jarrett, a longtime Obama adviser, said Biden wanted to ""channel his grief into action and figure out how we can do better"" on treating cancer to ""make sure that other people didn't have to go through what he went through.""The effort was formalised as a White House task force, with Biden in charge. After a few years out of office, Biden re-entered politics to campaign against Trump in 2020. The heartache from Beau's death was never far from the surface though. His eldest son had been Delaware's attorney general and often viewed as Biden's political successor.""Beau should be the one running for president, not me,"" Biden said, a thought he echoed on many occasions.He made fighting cancer a focus for his presidency, resurrecting a ""moonshot"" initiative to increase funding for research and improve treatment. He unveiled the initiative at the John F Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in 2022, echoing the Democratic icon's famous speech declaring that ""we will go to the moon"" six decades earlier.""Beating cancer is something we can do together,"" Biden said.By this point, he had already signed legislation known as the PACT Act to expand healthcare benefits for veterans. The law guarantees treatment for chronic illnesses blamed on burn pits, which were used to dispose of chemicals, tires, plastics, medical equipment and human waste on military bases.Biden left no doubt that he believed Beau's death resulted from his service with the National Guard in Iraq.""When they came home, many of the fittest and best warriors that we sent to war were not the same - headaches, numbness, dizziness, cancer,"" he said. ""My son Beau was one of them.""Denis McDonough, who led the Veterans Affairs Department under Biden, said the president didn't talk about Beau's death during policy discussions. But he said it was clear that Biden ""knew the experience that other families were having, and he was going to be damn sure that we weren't going to miss an opportunity to address that.""McDonough recalled that Biden wanted the new law to take effect as quickly as possible.""He had an option to stretch it out,"" he said. ""He said no way.""The following year, first lady Jill Biden had two cancerous lesions removed, one above her right eye and the other on her chest. They were both basal cell carcinoma.Learning of the diagnosis ""was a little harder than I thought,"" she told The Associated Press during a trip to Africa.""I'm lucky,"" she said. ""Believe me, I am so lucky that they caught it, they removed it, and I'm healthy.""Biden's cancer diagnosis is not the first time that he's faced his own mortality.Months after ending his first presidential campaign in 1988, he collapsed in a New York hotel room. In his memoir ""Promises to Keep,"" he described ""lightning flashing inside my head, a powerful electrical surge - and then a rip of pain like I'd never felt before.""He had suffered a brain aneurysm that required surgery. Biden wrote that ""I had no real fear of dying. I'd long since accepted the fact that life's guarantees don't include a fair shake.""McDonough imagined that Biden would feel similarly about his current situation.""He's always on to the next fight,"" he said.","Biden's office disclosed his prostate cancer diagnosis over the weekend, saying it has already spread to his bones. One decade ago, his son Beau died from a brain tumour. Several years later, his wife Jill had two cancerous lesions removed in her own brush with the disease.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121280992,imgsize-928116,width-400,resizemode-4/121280992.jpg"
Indiana man set for execution in state's second since 2009,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/indiana-man-set-for-execution-in-states-second-since-2009/articleshow/121280545.cms,"Benjamin Ritchie (AP)

Expressing regret and awaiting execution







MICHIGAN CITY: An Indiana man convicted in the 2000 killing of a police officer is set to receive a lethal injection early Tuesday in the state's second execution in 15 years. Benjamin Ritchie , 45, has been on death row for more than 20 years after being convicted in the fatal shooting of Beech Grove Police Officer Bill Toney during a foot chase.Ritchie is scheduled to be executed ""before the hour of sunrise"" at the Indiana State Prison in Michigan City, where anti-death penalty advocates gathered late Monday. The US Supreme Court declined to review the case late Monday, exhausting Ritchie's legal options to fight the death sentence.Indiana resumed executions in December after a year-long hiatus due to a scarcity of lethal injection drugs nationwide. Prison officials provided photos of the execution chamber before Joseph Corcoran's execution, showing a space that looks like an operating room with a gurney, fluorescent lighting, a floor drain and an adjacent viewing room. They've offered few other details about the process, including the time the executions take place.Among 27 states with death penalty laws, Indiana is one of two that bars media witnesses. The other, Wyoming, has conducted one execution in the last half-century.The Associated Press and other media organizations filed a federal lawsuit in Indiana seeking media access, but a federal judge denied a preliminary injunction last week that would have allowed journalists to witness Ritchie's execution and future ones.The judge found that barring the news media doesn't violate the First Amendment nor does it single out the news media for unequal treatment.The execution in Indiana is among 12 scheduled in eight states this year. Ritchie's execution and two others in Texas and Tennessee will be carried out this week.The 2000 fatal shooting of a police officer Ritchie was 20 when he and others stole a van in Beech Grove, near Indianapolis. He then fired at Toney during a foot chase, killing him.At the time Ritchie was on probation from a 1998 burglary conviction.Toney, 31, had worked at the Beech Grove Police Department for two years. He was the first officer of the small department to be killed by gunfire in the line of duty. The community of 14,000 people mourned the married father of two as a person who showed up to help others.When Toney died, ""Everyone of us involved, including Bill, had something stolen from them that they'll never get back,"" said Deputy Police Chief Tom Hurrle, who worked with him.Relatives spoke at a clemency hearing last week, urging for the execution to move forward.""It's time. We're all tired,"" said Dee Dee Horen, who was Toney's wife. ""It is time for this chapter of my story, our story, to be closed. It's time for us to remember Bill, to remember Bill's life, and not his death.""Appealing a death sentence Ritchie's attorneys have fought the death sentence, arguing his legal counsel at trial was ineffective because his lawyers failed to fully investigate and present evidence on his fetal alcohol spectrum disorders and childhood lead exposure.Current defense attorneys say Ritchie suffered ""severe brain damage"" because his mother abused alcohol and drugs during pregnancy and he's struggled with decision-making. He was also diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 2005.""He's finally come to have some coping skills. He's a different man,"" said defense attorney Steven Schutte.Republican Gov. Mike Braun rejected Ritchie's clemency bid last week as the parole board recommended. Braun didn't explain his decision, but board members said Ritchie's case didn't meet the bar for commuting a sentence and cited a dozen violations during Ritchie's time in prison, including threatening others with violence.The Indiana Supreme Court denied a request to stop the execution. Ritchie's attorneys challenged that decision in federal court, which a judge rejected. The 7th US Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the lower court on Sunday. Disability rights advocates say Ritchie's brain damage should exclude him from the death penalty.As the sun set Monday, the Rev. Richard Holy, a Catholic priest, recited the rosary with about 20 people in the prison parking lot and called for an end to the death penalty.Executing Ritchie ""is not going to bring Officer Toney back,"" Holy said. ""We don't have to keep taking one life to exact justice for taking another.""After the vigil, people were invited to ring a large bell displayed by a group opposed to the death penalty.Attorneys say Ritchie has changed during his more than two decades behind bars and shown remorse.In court as a young man, Ritchie smiled at Horen and laughed as the verdict was read.He told a parole board he deeply regrets his actions, especially how he acted with Toney's widow.""I wish I could go back to the day in court, because that man's wife deserved to say everything she needed to say to me, and that punk kid should have just kept his mouth shut and let her say whatever she needed to say,"" Ritchie said. ""That was her right. That was his family's right.""Ritchie has spent his last days getting visits from friends and family. Under state law, he's allowed up to five witnesses at his execution, which will include attorneys and friends.""I've ruined my life and other people's lives, and I'm so sorry for that night,"" he told the parole board earlier this month. ""You can't take back what you did.""","Benjamin Ritchie has been on death row for more than 20 years. He was convicted in the fatal shooting of Beech Grove Police Officer Bill Toney. Ritchie is scheduled to be executed ""before the hour of sunrise"" at the Indiana State Prison.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121280770,imgsize-508645,width-400,resizemode-4/121280770.jpg"

The United States Senate has confirmed real estate developer Charles Kushner , father-in-law of President Donald Trump 's daughter Ivanka, to serve as the US ambassador to France and the principality of Monaco.Kushner, who was confirmed 51-45, is the founder of Kushner Companies, a real estate firm. His son Jared is a former White House senior adviser married to Ivanka, the president's eldest daughter.New Hampshire Senator Jeanne Shaheen, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told Kushner his nomination comes at a “critical time” because “our European allies are anxious.”Shaheen also asked him about his criminal past. He replied he made a “very, very, very serious mistake"" and paid a ""very heavy price for that.”In 2005, Kushner was sentenced to two years in prison after pleading guilty to 18 counts, including tax evasion and witness tampering. It was the highest sentence he could receive under a plea deal, but less than what Chris Christie, the US attorney for New Jersey at the time and later governor and Republican presidential candidate, had sought. Christie called it “one of the most loathsome, disgusting crimes” he ever prosecuted as a US attorney.In 2020, the final year of his first presidency, Trump pardoned his in-law, citing the latter's ""more recent charitable work"" as the reason he deserved ""clemency.""""This record of reform and charity overshadows Mr. Kushner’s conviction and two-year sentence for preparing false tax returns, witness retaliation, and making false statements,"" the White House had said at the time.","Charles Kushner is the father-in-law of President Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka.

Kentucky cleans up

A Kansas City is spared 18 years after a tornado nearly wiped out the community



Hard-hit St. Louis waits for FEMA







LONDON: Thousands of people from Texas to Kentucky cleaned up Monday from severe weather that killed more than two dozen people and destroyed thousands of homes and buildings in four days as another round of tornadoes struck the central US.At least four tornadoes were confirmed in Oklahoma and Nebraska on Monday evening, according to a preliminary report from the National Weather Service In Wilburton, in southeast Texas, the city's Facebook page reported a tornado on the ground and heading its way. ""Take cover now!"" the post warned residents.In northern Texas, softball-sized hail was confirmed, according to Scott Kleebauer, meteorologist with the service's Weather Prediction Center.Earlier Monday in St. Louis, where officials estimated a Friday tornado damaged 5,000 buildings and may cost well over $1 billion, the mayor warned that federal assistance could take weeks.Kentucky has been hardest hit by the storms. A devastating tornado late Friday into early Saturday damaged hundreds of homes, tossed vehicles, left many homeless, and killed at least 19 people, most of them in southeastern Laurel County.In London, Kentucky, where the devastation was centered, the small airport became a beehive of cleanup work after it took a direct hit from a tornado. Small aircraft stored there had large dents in them and even wings ripped open. Officials were using it as a base to get water, food, diapers and other supplies out to the community.""We have 1,001 things going on. But we're managing it. And we're going to get it all cleaned up,"" said London Mayor Randall Weddle.Officials in Kansas and Texas also were evaluating damage from late Sunday storms.The risk of severe storms moves into Alabama, Mississippi and Tennessee on Tuesday, the weather service said.The Kentucky storms that killed 19 people were part of a weather system that caused seven deaths in Missouri and two in northern Virginia, authorities said.Lonnie Nantz hid in a hallway with his wife, two daughters and a grandson as the one-story brick home they bought near London in 1977 was destroyed around them. They were trapped in rubble for about 20 minutes in the midnight darkness before they were rescued unharmed.""I don't know why this happened. I've tried to live a good life all my life. I've still got the faith,"" said the 77-year-old Nantz, who went to church as always on Sunday.London city worker Ashley Taylor was back on the job Monday loading doughnuts to take to a hospital and dispatch center even though there was a tarp on her roof. She was lucky - the houses across her street were destroyed late Friday night.She survived the storm with nine other people and three dogs in the crawl space of a neighbor's home.""We prayed like never before - and just thankful for everything God did for us,"" Taylor said.In surrounding Laurel County, first responders mourned one of their own.Fellow firefighters found the body of Laurel County Fire Major Leslie Leatherman on top of a woman he was shielding from the storm's fury as he answered calls during the worst of the storm. The woman was yelling for help and they were in a field across from a destroyed subdivision.The injured woman turned out to be Leatherman's wife and officials aren't sure if he knew who he was protecting in the darkness and chaos, the fire department said on social media.Forecasters on Sunday night issued a tornado emergency for Greensburg, Kansas, where 12 people were killed and 90% of the town was destroyed in May 2007 by a 1.5-mile (2.4-kilometer) wide tornado with winds of 205 mph (330 kph).The city was spared this time. Power was out but residents were safe after the ""storm scare,"" Greensburg officials posted on social media.Tornadoes in Kansas carved a 20-mile (32-kilometer) path through Stafford and Reno counties. While damage was extensive, no injuries or deaths were reported.St. Louis Mayor Cara Spencer said five people died, 38 were injured and more than 5,000 homes were affected by an EF3 tornado with winds up to 150 mph (240 kph) that slammed areas north and west of downtown Friday. Spencer has estimated that damages will exceed $1.6 billion.""Eight miles of pure destruction, at times a mile wide,"" Spencer said at a Monday news conference. ""We're talking about thousands of buildings, thousands of families are being displaced.""The city is awaiting a disaster declaration from the governor's office as a first step to getting federal assistance.US Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, expressed frustration over the federal response to a deadly March storm. ""I'm not happy about the fact we're still waiting from all of that damage two months ago,"" Hawley said.Acting Federal Emergency Management Agency Chief David Richardson said last week he plans to shift responsibility for disaster recovery to states this year as part of an agencywide transformation and that FEMA would coordinate federal assistance ""when deemed necessary.""Spencer said during a news conference Monday evening that emergency protocols put in place in 2021 were not followed, possibly preventing sirens being activated to warn residents about the tornado.She said it was not clear whose responsibility it was to let the community know about the emergency but that the fire department will do so moving forward.In Texas, several tornadoes touched down west of Fort Worth on Sunday, including an EF1 with peak winds of 105 mph (169 kph) that caused damage in and around Gordon, the weather service said Monday.","At least four tornadoes confirmed in Oklahoma and Nebraska on Monday evening.

While four of the 10 inmates who broke out of a New Orleans prison have been caught, officials continue to investigate who or what was to blame in a jailbreak which even the escapees labelled as “easy” — in a message scrawled on a wall above the narrow hole they managed to squeeze through.Orleans Parish Sheriff Susan Hutson said she has been raising concerns about Orleans Justice Center 's ongoing “deficiencies."" The jailbreak, Hutson added, has “once again highlighted the critical need for repairs and upgrades” to the ailing infrastructure.""Since becoming sheriff in 2022, I have complained about the locks at every turn and advocated for additional funding to make the facility more secure,"" news agency AP quoted the sheriff as saying.Louisiana attorney general Liz Murrill, too, said some cell unit doors and locks have been “manipulated"" to the point that they can't even be closed properly.Four days before the men escaped, Jeworski “Jay” Mallet, chief of corrections for the jail, had presented a need for a new lock system during the city's Capital Improvement Plan hearing.However, there are other crucial elements which officials have outlined. For instance, indications the escape was an ""inside job""; the hole which officials suggest may have been formed using power tools; a lack of monitoring of the cell pod; and law enforcement ""not being aware"" of the jailbreak until seven hours after the men fled.Meanwhile, others have pointed to Sheriff Hutson being at fault.“Rather than take accountability, she’s pointed fingers elsewhere,” Louisana representative Aimee Adatto Freeman, who represents much of the uptown area of New Orleans, said Monday as she called for the sheriff to step down.Early last Friday, 10 men being held at the Orleans Justice Center — many awaiting trials or sentencing for violent charges, including murder — broke open a cell door, slipped through a hole behind a toilet, scaled a barbed wire fence and fled into the dark.The fourth and most recent arrest came late Monday, when 21-year-old Gary Price was taken into custody.","Orleans Parish Sheriff Susan Hutson said she has been raising concerns about Orleans Justice Center's ongoing ""deficiencies"" The jailbreak, Hutson added, has “once again highlighted the critical need for repairs and upgrades”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121279408,imgsize-1219108,width-400,resizemode-4/121279408.jpg"

What is Gleason score?



How Gleason score determined?







US former President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with an ""aggressive form"" of prostate cancer that has metastasised to the bone, as announced by a spokesperson on May 18. The diagnosis was confirmed two days prior to the public announcement.The spokesperson revealed that Biden's cancer has been classified with a Gleason score of 9, Grade Group 5. This classification requires detailed explanation for better understanding.On Biden's health, US President Donald Trump was surprised and called the news ""very sad, actually.""""I'm surprised that … you know, the public wasn't notified a long time ago because to get to stage nine (sic), that's a long time,"" Trump said on Monday while talking to reporters. Here Trump referred stage nine to Gleason score.The Gleason scoring system, utilised for prostate cancer grading, spans from 6 to 10, as explained by the Cleveland Clinic. Lower scores indicate slower growth patterns, whilst higher scores suggest more aggressive development, US Today reported.The grading system incorporates five distinct groups, with Grade Group 1 indicating slow progression and Grade Group 5 suggesting rapid growth and spread.Biden's diagnosis of Gleason score 9, Grade Group 5, indicates significant cellular differences from healthy tissue.The scoring process involves examining cancer cell patterns. Medical professionals assign grades from 1 to 5 based on how closely the cells resemble normal prostate tissue. The final score combines the grades of the two most prevalent patterns observed.Diagnostic scoring relies on prostate biopsy or surgical results. The Cleveland Clinic emphasises that higher scores primarily guide treatment decisions rather than definitively indicating outcomes.The Mayo Clinic notes that prostate cancer typically presents early and progresses slowly. Statistical data from the American Cancer Society suggests most diagnosed men survive the condition.Projections for 2025 indicate approximately 313,780 new prostate cancer cases and 35,770 related deaths. Statistics show that one in eight men receive this diagnosis, whilst one in 44 succumb to it.Early symptoms may include urinary changes, whilst advanced cases might present with bone pain, fatigue, and unexplained weight loss. Medical consultation is advised for anyone experiencing concerning symptoms.","US former President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with an ""aggressive form"" of prostate cancer.

US President Donald Trump on Monday fuelled speculation that Joe Biden's cancer diagnosis was ""covered up,"" saying he was ""surprised"" the public was not told about his predecessor's condition earlier.""I'm surprised that the public wasn't notified a long time ago,"" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office when asked for his reaction to Biden's cancer.""It takes a long time to get to that situation, to get to a stage nine,"" he added, apparently referring to the announcement by the ex-US president's office that the Democrat's cancer had ""a Gleason score of 9 (Grade Group 5).""Prostate cancer which looks ""very abnormal"" is assigned the highest rating, Grade 5, according to the American Cancer Society. The Gleason Score goes up to 10, indicating the seriousness of Biden's disease.Meanwhile, Trump further suggested that Biden's tests, when the latter was in office, ""should have picked up"" the signs of the disease.""If you take a look it's the same doctor that said Joe was cognitively fine. There are things going on that the public wasn't informed of,"" he stated.The Republican's extraordinary claim came just a day after he expressed ""sadness"" after it emerged that his bitter Democratic political rival had an ""aggressive form"" of prostate cancer.Earlier, Trump's son Donald Trump Junior and US Vice President JD Vance, too, alleged Biden's cancer diagnosis was ""covered up.""Trump Junior posted a clip of Biden, whose son Beau died of brain cancer in 2015, saying in an apparent gaffe in 2022 that ""I, and so damn many other people I grew up with, have cancer.""Vance meanwhile said that ""we really do need to be honest"" about Biden's fitness.The former president's team has consistently denied there was any effort to hide fears about his health.","US President Donald Trump fuelled speculation that Joe Biden's cancer diagnosis was ""covered up"" Trump said he was ""surprised"" the public was not told about his predecessor's condition earlier.

The Newark Liberty International Airport was hit by another air traffic control outage on Monday morning, the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) said.According to the FAA, the Philadelphia air traffic control centre, which manages flights at Newark Liberty International Airport, experienced a brief radio system failure for two seconds.This marks the fourth such disruption at Newark Airport since April 28, amidst ongoing technical and personnel challenges. Following the April incident, a 90-second communication interruption occurred on May 9, causing flight disruptions . Another outage on May 11 halted flights, while staff shortages related to the April incident caused extensive delays, CBS News reported.The Philadelphia facility controlling Newark flights currently faces understaffing issues. These issues highlight the critical shortage of air traffic controllers across the United States.US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced this month that modernisation of the national air traffic control system is in progress. The upgrade includes new software and equipment installations, with costs expected to reach ""tens of billions of dollars,"" according to Duffy.The current system operates on outdated technology, forcing the FAA to source replacement parts from eBay or create them using 3D printers due to unavailability of new components, as Duffy informed a Senate Appropriations subcommittee in April.Due to ongoing issues at ERW, the FAA suggests implementing significant flight restrictions, limiting arrivals to 28 per hour.The proposed reduction in air traffic would enable the airport to undertake runway construction and improvements. The daily maintenance work is scheduled to continue until June 15, followed by weekly Saturday operations through to year-end.","The Philadelphia air traffic control centre, which manages flights at Newark Liberty International Airport, experienced a brief radio system failure for two seconds.

The Baloch Liberation Army’s media wing, Hakkal, has released a chilling 35-minute video of the hijacking of the Jaffar Express, with 450 passengers on board, in March, where the group bombed a remote railway track.The Baloch outfit dubbed the hijacking “Operation Darra-e-Bolan 2.0"" and revealed the first detailed account of events, challenging Pakistan's official statements whilst demonstrating the BLA's operational command.The footage revealed BLA's systematic attack preparations against Pakistani military, featuring their training sessions, reconnaissance activities, and tactical discussions. Senior commanders outlined strategies for stopping the train, managing hostages and countering military helicopters.In the video, a BLA member explains their position: ""Our struggle and war has come to a point where we are to take such critical decisions.

A 4.7-magnitude earthquake hit Pakistan's Swat district and nearby regions on Sunday, according to ARY News.The quake struck at a depth of 205 kilometres, with its epicentre in the Hindukush mountain range — a known seismic zone spanning parts of Afghanistan and northern Pakistan.Tremors were felt across several areas of Swat, including Mingora and its outskirts. Authorities confirmed there were no immediate reports of damage.Earlier, on May 12, a 4.9-magnitude earthquake had shaken Quetta, the capital of Balochistan.The National Seismic Monitoring Centre (NSMC) confirmed that the 4.9-magnitude tremors affected Quetta and neighbouring regions. The quake's epicentre was situated west of Quetta, according to NSMC data.The tremor came just two days after Pakistan was hit by two consecutive earthquakes on Saturday — a 5.7-magnitude quake in the morning and a 4.0-magnitude tremor later in the day, according to Reuters.Pakistan's geographical position makes it particularly vulnerable to seismic activity, as it sits at the intersection of the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates. The country's territory is traversed by numerous significant fault lines, resulting in frequent and potentially damaging earthquakes.","A 4.7-magnitude earthquake hit Pakistan's Swat district and nearby regions on Sunday.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan late Saturday revealed that it too would launch a diplomatic campaign led by foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari to present its narrative to the world. This comes after India announced it would dispatch seven all-party delegations to key capitals to brief global leaders on Operation Sindoor and its counter-terrorism efforts “I was contacted earlier today by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who requested that I lead a delegation to present Pakistan's case for peace on the international stage. I am honoured to accept this responsibility and remain committed to serving Pakistan in these challenging times,” Bhutto-Zardari wrote in a Facebook post on Saturday.However, there was no official confirmation of the campaign from the Pakistan government.The announcement follows India’s decision to send seven all-party delegations to key global capitals to brief foreign governments on its precision military strikes under Operation Sindoor. Launched on May 7 in response to the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack, the operation targeted nine terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Over 100 terrorists affiliated with groups like Jaish-e-Mohammed Lashkar-e-Taiba , and Hizbul Mujahideen were reportedly killed.Following the strikes, Pakistan retaliated with cross-border shelling and attempted drone incursions. In response, India launched secondary strikes targeting Pakistani military infrastructure, including radar systems and communication nodes.To consolidate international backing, union minister Kiren Rijiju announced that delegations led by prominent leaders such as Shashi Tharoor, Ravi Shankar Prasad, Sanjay Kumar Jha, Baijayant Panda, Kanimozhi Karunanidhi, Supriya Sule, and Shrikant Eknath Shinde will visit UN Security Council member states and strategic allies.“In moments that matter most, Bharat stands united. Seven All-Party Delegations will soon visit key partner nations, carrying our shared message of zero tolerance to terrorism .

Human rights violations in Sindh





Jeay Sindh Freedom Movement ( JSFM ), a political group advocating for Sindhu Desh, staged a peaceful sit-in protest on a highway in Pakistan on Friday, demanding the release of missing and jailed Sindhi nationalists. With traffic halted and slogans echoing through the air, the group sought global attention to enforced disappearances , illegal detentions, and human rights abuses in Sindh and Balochistan.JSFM leaders, including chairman Sohail Abro, Zubair Sindhi, and Amar Azadi, called for the immediate release of Zahid Channa, Sajad Channa, Adnan Baloch, Badshah Baloch, Rafiqat Manghanhar, and Shahid Soomro. They also demanded that false charges against them be withdrawn and that all forcibly arrested persons be freed.""This peaceful sit-in serves as a protest against the unlawful arrests of our nationalist activists, the abuses occurring in jails, and the enforced disappearances. Our effort is peaceful and democratic, and we will persist until our people are free,"" the collective statement read.The protestors warned the Hyderabad Jail authorities against further mistreatment of detainees and threatened to block the prison’s main gate if abuse continued.They also called out to international organisations like the UN, Amnesty International, and Human Rights Watch, urging intervention and global condemnation of Pakistan's rights violations.A 2022 US State Department report, had pointed out widespread cases of extrajudicial killings and the recovery of mutilated bodies across Sindh.In 2024, Abro had also appealed for help in the case of Priya Kumari, a missing Hindu girl, stressing rising cases of forced conversions and marriages to Muslim men.Sindhis have been historically struggling for identity and autonomy. They accuse the Pakistani state of erasing local culture through systemic oppression—citing Urdu imposition, the ‘One unit’ policy, and historic land grabs like the removal of Karachi from Sindh.Meanwhile, in related developments, Balochistan declared independence from Pakistan this week. On social media, hashtags like #RepublicOfBalochistan trended, with users sharing proposed flags and maps.","Jeay Sindh Freedom Movement (JSFM) staged a peaceful sit-in protest on a highway in Pakistan on Friday, demanding the release of missing and jailed Sindhi nationalists.

Pakistan’s high commissioner to Bangladesh, Syed Ahmed Maroof , has abruptly gone on leave after videos of his alleged honeytrap surfaced online, according to Bangladeshi daily Prothom Alo.Maroof left Dhaka on the morning of 11 May, travelling to Islamabad via Dubai. That same day, the Pakistan high commission in Dhaka formally notified Bangladesh’s ministry of foreign affairs of his departure, a senior ministry official told Prothom Alo on Tuesday.Diplomatic sources in Dhaka suggest that Maroof’s recall may be linked to controversy surrounding a personal visit to Cox’s Bazar during the recent India-Pakistan conflict, and his alleged association with a female Bangladeshi government official, Daily Sun reported.Under diplomatic protocol, when an ambassador takes leave, the host country’s foreign ministry is informed of the duration and who will assume responsibilities in the interim. While the Pakistan high commission confirmed that deputy high commissioner Muhammad Asif will serve as acting high commissioner, no timeframe for Maroof’s leave was provided in official communication, Prothom Alo noted.Maroof had played a high-profile role in Dhaka and Islamabad ties, particularly following the ousting of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s government on 5 August 2024, in the wake of a student-led uprising.Rumours of the scandal escalated after photos and alleged intimate videos surfaced online, showing Maroof with a Bangladeshi woman. This also led to speculation that the envoy had been honey-trapped.","Pakistan’s high commissioner to Bangladesh, Syed Ahmed Maroof, has abruptly gone on leave after videos of his alleged honeytrap surfaced online.

Breeding ground for violence

Nowruz holiday declared 'un-Islamic'

Women's rights in decline

Afghans deported from Iran





Amid many other global crises, the human rights situation in Afghanistan has been overshadowed in the international media. Millions of people continue to suffer from systemic rights violations under the Taliban-run government, a UN report has found.Tasked with assisting the people of Afghanistan, the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) monitors the human rights situation in the country, issuing regular reports. In its latest update on the human rights situation in Afghanistan, UNAMA not only documented cases of gender-based violence and public floggings but also the growing persecution of the Ismaili community.Ismailism is a branch of Shia Islam, while Sunni Islam is the dominant religion in Afghanistan. Most members of the Ismaili community live in the country's northern provinces, such as Badakhshan or Baghlan. In the former, there have been at least 50 cases of members of the Ismaili community being forced to convert to the Sunni faith. Those who refused to do so were subjected to physical assaults, coercion and death threats.""They are only accepted as Muslims if they profess the Sunni faith by force,"" Yaqub Yasna, a professor and member of the Afghan Ismaili community, told DW.Yasna himself was accused of blasphemy after the Taliban takeover of 2021 because he advocated enlightenment and tolerance in society. He was forced to step down from his position at his university and went into exile for fear of reprisals.Yasna said that even before the Taliban's return to power, tolerance toward the Ismaili minority in Afghanistan was limited but that the political system had at least protected their civil rights.He said that under the Taliban, tolerance had continued to decline steadily. ""When their rights are violated today, they don't know who they can turn to. Their children are forced to profess the Sunni faith,"" he explained. ""Under Taliban rule, only one faith is considered legitimate. Anything that deviates from their interpretation of Islam is rejected and thus creates a breeding ground for violence against religious minorities. ""Afghan human rights activist Abdullah Ahmadi confirmed there was increasing pressure on one of the last remaining religious minorities in Afghanistan. ""We have received several reports showing that children from the Ismaili community are being forced to attend Sunni-run religious schools. If they refuse to do so, or do not attend classes regularly, their families have to pay heavy fines,"" he said.Ahmadi complained that the international community had responded only hesitantly to the human rights violations in his country. He called for targeted sanctions against Taliban officials, saying they ""must be held accountable.""Historically, the country was a significant center of religious diversity, but there are very few members of non-Muslim communities left in Afghanistan today.The last members of the Jewish community left the country in September 2021. Those Christians who still live there tend to practice their faith in secret. And the Hazaras, another ethnic minority in Afghanistan who are predominantly Shiite, continue to be persecuted.The Taliban only accept one interpretation of religion and have banned certain rituals and festivals, including Nowruz, which marks the beginning of spring and a new year. They declared the holiday ""un-Islamic"" and said that nobody in Afghanistan should observe the celebration.The situation of all women is also getting worse, which means that half of society is subject to systematic oppression. According to the UNAMA report, girls continue to be ""barred from participating in education beyond grade six"" and there has been ""no announcement made by the de facto authorities regarding the reopening of high schools and universities to girls and women.""In the western city of Herat, the Taliban has confiscated several rickshaws and warned drivers not to transport women who were unaccompanied by a ""mahram,"" a close male relative.Despite this disastrous situation, Afghans who fled to neighboring countries are being expelled en masse. According to the United Nations, around 110,000 people, including women and children, were forced to return in April. Large numbers of people are also being deported from Iran.""We live in fear of being deported to Afghanistan every day,"" Afghan journalist Marzia Rahimi told DW. ""What am I supposed to do with my children there?""Rahimi said that only misery and terror awaited her in Afghanistan if she returned, explaining that she had left because she was unable to continue working as a journalist under Taliban rule and would not have been able to provide her daughter with an education.Most independent media outlets have been banned or placed under the control of the state. Journalists who criticize the regime risk being arrested and tortured.Under the Taliban, the country has also been plunged into an even more catastrophic socioeconomic crisis. Some 64% of the population of 41.5 million lives in poverty, according to the UN, with 50% dependent on humanitarian aid for survival and 14% suffering from acute hunger.","The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) monitors the human rights situation in the country.

Balochistan ‘Quakes’ After Deadly Blast Near Pak Security Base; ‘Over Two Dozen Casualties…’





Four people died and 20 were injured in a car bomb explosion on Sunday night, in Qillah Abdullah, a city in Balochistan province bordering Afghanistan.Several shops and the outer wall of a nearby building housing paramilitary forces were damaged.No group has claimed responsibility for the bombing, according to deputy commissioner Abdullah Riaz, news agency AP reported.The ethnic Baloch separatists remain under suspicion as they frequently target security forces and civilians in Balochistan and other parts of Pakistan.Shahid Rind, a spokesperson for the Balochistan government, condemned the bombing and said an investigation is underway.Balochistan has been a focal point of a prolonged insurgency in Pakistan, with various separatist groups carrying out attacks, including the banned Balochistan Liberation Army , which was labeled a terrorist organization by the United States in 2019.Pakistan frequently accuses its rival India of backing the BLA and the Pakistani Taliban, both of which have escalated their attacks in Pakistan in recent months. One of the deadliest of these assaults occurred in March, when BLA insurgents killed 33 people, mostly soldiers, in an attack on a train carrying hundreds of passengers in Balochistan.On May 11, the BLA called for Indian support against Pakistan, making the appeal amid heightened tensions between the two countries.India has not yet responded to the BLA’s overture.The BLA further denied claims that it operated as an Indian proxy and said, “If we receive political, diplomatic and defense support from the world, especially from India, the Baloch nation can eliminate this terrorist state and lay the foundation for a peaceful, prosperous and independent Balochistan.”The group assured the Indian government that, if provided support, its fighters would open an additional front against Pakistan's military near the Afghan border, an area where the Pakistani Taliban maintains strongholds.","Four people died and 20 were injured in a car bomb explosion on Sunday night, in Qillah Abdullah, a city in Balochistan province bordering Afghanistan.

An earthquake of 4.2 magnitude has jolted Afghanistan in the early hours of Monday, according to the National Centre for Seismology (NCS). The tremors occurred around 08.54 am IST and were recorded at a depth of 140 kms.The NCS posted the details of the earthquake on its X account. The epicenter was located at a latitude of 36.41 N and longitude of 70.94 E. This is the fourth consecutive earthquake to hit the country in the last four days.Earlier on Sunday, a 4.5-magnitude earthquake shook Afghanistan. According to the NCS, it occurred at a depth of 150 kilometres.Previously on 17 May, an earthquake of magnitude 4.2 struck the region.On 16 May, another earthquake of magnitude 4.0 struck the region.Experts suggested that deeper earthquakes are less dangerous than shallow earthquakes because the seismic waves travel a longer distance before reaching the earth's surface due to which they lose their energy.Afghanistan has a history of powerful earthquakes. According to the Red Cross, the Hindu Kush region is a geologically active area where earthquakes occur every year.Afghanistan is situated on several fault lines between the Indian and the Eurasian tectonic plates, making it a seismically active region. A major fault line also runs directly through Herat. These plates meet and collide resulting in frequent seismic activity.According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs ( UNOCHA ), Afghanistan remains highly vulnerable to natural disasters. This also includes seasonal flooding, landslides and earthquakes.UNOCHA noted that these frequent earthquakes in Afghanistan can cause damage to vulnerable communities that are already struggling with decades of conflict and under-development. These challenges have left them with limited capacity to cope with multiple disasters at once.","Afghanistan is situated on several fault lines between the Indian and the Eurasian tectonic plates, making it a seismically active region.

'Some teachers will buy pads for us'



Cloth pads can be unsafe



Government initiatives fall short



New vouchers expected this year







When 14-year-old Janani gets her period, she doesn't always make it to school. Some days, there are no sanitary pads at home, and Janani is forced to use a pad made from old clothes. On those days, she skips classes.""I feel ashamed of using cloth,"" Janani told DW. ""If we miss school because of this, they won't teach us again the lessons we've missed, will they?""A survey conducted by DW of more than 500 girls across six schools in Sri Lanka's Central Province indicated that nearly half — 46% — struggled to afford pads each month, with the figure skyrocketing to 81% at one school.Janani's mother works as a tea plucker in the hills of Nuwara Eliya District and earns about 1,350 rupees (around €4 or $4.5) per day. She buys her daughter pads when she can afford it. When she has no pads, Janani said, she wonders ""why I get my period at all.""Almost half of the girls surveyed by DW said they missed school during their period for a myriad of reasons, including excessive pain. And it is affecting their school performance.""I keep thinking about it, and so I can't study,"" said 14-year-old Girija referring to period poverty , a sentiment echoed by some of her peers.Sri Lanka's government is making an effort to address the problem as its economy inches towards recovery following an economic collapse in 2022.The cost of a pack of 10 sanitary napkins increased by 92% after the economic crisis, from 140 to 270 rupees, according to the Advocata Institute. Imported sanitary pads continue to be taxed in Sri Lanka at 51%.Teacher Anthonyraj Devaneshi told DW that her school gave out one sanitary pad to girls in emergency situations, but could not afford to give them out consistently.""Some teachers will buy pads for us, but others won't,"" said 12-year-old Harini, adding that she found it awkward to ask and would usually ask her friends to do it on her behalf. ""If my friends aren't at school [when I get my period], I'll just come home.""Harini has to make the long journey home by herself if her parents are unable to pick her up — a walk which takes her an hour through the hills.Her school also has no place for girls to dispose of their sanitary pads, with several girls telling DW they avoided changing at school. Two schools had a policy requiring students who took a pad from school to purchase a replacement and hand it in the next day.A 2021 study by Advocata revealed that half of Sri Lankan women did not spend any money on sanitary products.Rashmira Balasuriya, director of the Arka Initiative to combat period poverty and technical advisor to Sri Lanka's Family Planning Association, said the issue had ""most likely gotten worse"" following the COVID-19 pandemic and economic crisis.To save money, many girls use cloth. About 44% of the girls surveyed by DW reported using a combination of cloth and pads or exclusively cloth during their period, although not all of them cited unaffordability as the reason.Balasuriya said the lack of sunlight in Sri Lanka's hill country meant cloth pads were not always safe to use, because they would not properly dry.Girija told DW she had started using pads after developing an infection from cloth. ""Using cloth is hard. It feels like it's not secure,"" she said. ""I feel scared to sit because I'm worried something might happen. It's hard to walk, to sit, or to sleep.""At least a dozen other girls told DW they had also developed infections from using cloth.Girija said her family took out loans from the store to buy pads and she felt angry with her mother when they could not afford them. However, her mother told her, ""It doesn't matter if we have to use cloth, you use pads."" Still, Girija only changes her pad only once every seven hours, afraid of running out.""When we use cloth for too long, sometimes it burns,"" said 13-year-old Saraswathi, who sometimes uses cloth pads even at school, although she avoids changing for the entire day. ""It's difficult to walk with cloth, and my hips hurt.""Teacher Thiruchelvam Mangala Roobini said there was also a lack of awareness around menstruation, with many girls who lacked pads forced to bleed through their underwear, which they would then dispose of in the toilets.Last year, the Sri Lankan government distributed two vouchers of 600 rupees each to 800,000 schoolgirls, with the last disbursement given in September 2024. The goal of the scheme was to allow the girls to buy sanitary pads.But Balasuriya said the voucher system was ""not a sustainable one,"" as the average woman needs about 20 pads over five days in a single month, and the money was simply insufficient. Some girls told DW the pads they purchased had run out in one or two months.Roobini believes that many girls did not purchase sanitary pads with the vouchers, citing previous instances where shoe vouchers provided by the government had been used to purchase other necessities.One school principal told DW he was ""100% sure"" that the sanitary pad voucher had even been used to purchase alcohol.The current government, led by Anura Kumara Dissanayake, announced in March that it would spend 1.44 billion rupees on a similar initiative, distributing two vouchers of 720 rupees each to all menstruating schoolgirls.A representative from the Department of Education told DW the initiative would begin again at the end of May, but it was not possible to say whether it would continue after the two sets of voucher disbursements. The lawmakers have yet to decide on the issue.""If they give us pads continuously, it'll be good,"" 14-year-old Girija told DW. ""Then they won't run out, right? We can keep using them.""","Nearly half of Sri Lankan girls struggle to afford sanitary pads each month. The cost of a pack of 10 sanitary napkins increased by 92% after the economic crisis. To save money, many girls use cloth during their period, which can be unsafe.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121184660,imgsize-1118791,width-400,resizemode-4/121184660.jpg"
Salt of the earth: Pilot project helping reclaim Sri Lankan farms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/salt-of-the-earth-pilot-project-helping-reclaim-sri-lankan-farms/articleshow/121176156.cms,"AP file photo

Yields under threat

Seeping salt



Resistant varieties







Katukurunda: A commando in an elite Sri Lankan police unit, Sameera Dilshan has an unusual mission, to reclaim farms poisoned by salt, a long-standing problem now accelerating due to climate change.Increasing salinity is slowly and steadily swallowing traditional rice paddies along the island's coastline, taking away the livelihood of generations of farmers.Two hours' drive south of the capital Colombo lies Katukurunda, one of the camps of the formidable Special Task Force (STF), created four decades ago to fight Tamil rebels.While his colleagues train for riot control under the humid heat of the nearby Indian Ocean, the 35-year-old non-commissioned officer and his ""commando-farmer"" team are hoeing, weeding and watering.Their goal? To grow coconut palms and a wide variety of fruits and vegetables in a paddy declared dead 40 years ago due to salt water contamination.""This plantation was launched in 2022 as part of a government initiative to improve food security,"" Dilshan said, with local authorities allocating land parcels.The method, known as sorjan, is similar to techniques used in Thailand and Indonesia.It reshapes flood-prone land by digging ponds where rice can be grown or fish raised, with more saline-tolerant coconut trees planted.Embankments around these ponds are used for more delicate crops.""We're tending to 360 coconut trees planted here... along with pumpkins, gourds and cucumbers,"" Dilshan said. ""In two and a half years, we'll know if it's a success or not.""""It's an efficient and climate-resilient production system that optimises land use and productivity, and increases farmers' profits,"" said Buddhi Marambe, from the University of Peradeniya.The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said in a 2024 report that saltwater from seas and oceans affects 10.7 percent of the Earth's land, making it uncultivable in some cases.It travels up rivers with the tides, seeps into soil through evaporation, and contaminates groundwater used for irrigation.Climate change, which dries out the soil, reduces water resources, or raises sea levels, is expected to increase the proportion of such ""salty"" land from 24 percent to 32 percent of the world's surface area by the end of the century, the FAO predicts.These trends ""threaten agricultural productivity and reduce crop yields in affected zones"", it warns.Sri Lanka is no exception.Marambe estimates that 223,000 hectares (551,000 acres), half of which are rice paddies, are impacted by salinity -- nearly eight percent of the country's total arable land.South of the pilot plantation lies the village of Parappuwa, surrounded by abandoned land.Here, just a few kilometres from the sea, only a few small areas of the paddy fields are still in use.""Everything is polluted by salt that comes up during high tide,"" said Gamini Piyal Wijesinghe, 46, a farmer's son who, after he left the army, went into the restaurant business instead.He pointed to a stream where 18 small dams were built to stop the seawater.""They weren't constructed properly,"" he said. ""The water seeps through.""Other former rice farmers have turned to cinnamon or rubber cultivation.""Cinnamon is doing fairly well, but our income has significantly dropped since we stopped growing rice,"" said W.D. Jayaratne, 50, head of the local farmers' association.The future is gloomy.""Salinity in the water is increasing and threatening our farmland,"" he added. ""There are also insects. Everywhere you look, there are problems.""In this district of Kalutara, local authorities are offering abandoned land to farmers to bring it back under cultivation, mostly with coconut trees.""We've already allocated 400 hectares and plan to increase that to 1,000 in the next two years,"" said district chief Janaka Gunawardana.""There's high demand for coconut. It will create income for our people.""In Katukurunda, Aruna Priyankara Perera, 55, was encouraged by the success of the STF farming experiment.""I got five acres (two hectares) next to my hotel to replicate the STF's project,"" he said in front of his freshly planted coconut and pumpkin field.""The land is free for two years, provided you can show it's being cultivated.""Rice, the local staple, is a top concern for the authorities.""Soil salinity is a major issue in Sri Lanka,"" Marambe said. ""We've successfully tested several promising rice varieties that are resistant to salinity and flooding.""The stakes are high.A recent study of the Bentota river estuary, in the island's southwest, found that half of local rice farmers had lost all their income due to saltwater contamination.Even more serious, Sri Lanka's food security is now under threat. The last rice harvest, from September to March, was the country's lowest since 2019.""If we don't all roll up our sleeves to bring salt-polluted land back into cultivation and production,"" Marambe said, ""the future will only get darker.""",Sri Lankan commando-farmer team aims to reclaim rice paddies poisoned by salt.

Funerals held in Myanmar for pupils and teachers killed in airstrike on school,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/funerals-held-in-myanmar-for-pupils-and-teachers-killed-in-airstrike-on-school/articleshow/121163870.cms,"Funerals held in Myanmar for pupils and teachers killed in airstrike on school (Photo: AP)





Funerals have been held in Myanmar for almost two dozen students and teachers alleged to have been killed in an airstrike on a local school by a ruling military jet fighter.Local resistance groups and independent media said Tuesday that 20 pupils and 2 teachers died in the attack on Ohe Htein Twin village, in Sagaing region's township of Tabayin, also known as Depayin. Their reports said that as many as 100 people were wounded.The dead students were from grades 2 to 11, with the youngest seven years old, according to the shadow National Unity Government, which serves as an umbrella organization for opponents of military ruleA member of a local resistance group fighting against army rule told The Associated Press that another student, who was severely injured in Monday's bombing, died Tuesday afternoon while undergoing medical treatment.The resistance fighter, who requested that neither he nor his group be named for fear of arrest by the military, said the incident occurred while more than 100 students were studying in a school in the village, which has about 500 houses. He denied that any resistance fighters were stationed in the village that was attacked.Sagaing has been a stronghold of armed resistance to army rule in Myanmar, and the military in recent years has stepped up airstrikes in their fight against resistance forces, which include the armed People's Defense Forces.The resistance has no effective defense against air attacks, which many reports say hit non-military targets.Myanmar has been in turmoil since the army's 2021 takeover ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, which led to nationwide peaceful protests that escalated into a durable armed resistance denying the army control of much of the country.A report Tuesday in the state-run Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper denied the army had carried out the airstrike, saying malicious media outlets were intentionally spreading fake information. The military's tight control over the media and the relative remoteness of many such incidents makes independent confirmation of what occurred difficult.The bodies of 18 of the victims, most of them under the age of 10 were buried Monday in two village cemeteries after hastily arranged funerals just a few hours after the bombing incident, the unidentified resistance fighter said.About 100 wounded people, both students and teachers, were being treated in regional hospitals as the village's clinic lacked adequate facilities. At least two victims have had to have limbs amputated, he added.A member of another resistance group, the White Depeyin People's Defence Force, also speaking on condition of anonymity, told the AP that the funerals concluded on Tuesday.A report on Tuesday by the human rights ministry of the national unity government said the jet fighter took off from an airbase in Meiktila township in the central region of Mandalay on Monday morning and deliberately attacked the school with two cluster bombs while students were preparing to sit for their exams.""All individuals implicated in the commanding, execution, or collusion of deliberate air strikes against innocent children, students, and educators shall be subject to stringent judicial repercussions,"" the group said in a separate statement. ""No avenue for impunity shall be permitted. Every responsible party will be pursued without respite, unequivocally identified, held accountable and subjected to stringent punitive measures under the full force of the law. ""The military has increasingly used airstrikes to counter the widespread armed struggle against its rule. More than 6,600 civilians are estimated to have been killed by security forces since the army's 2021 takeover, according to figures compiled by nongovernmental organizations.Airstrikes in Myanmar garnered increased attention recently when numerous reports deemed credible by the United Nations and human rights groups said that they continued to be carried out in the wake of Myanmar's devastating March 28 earthquake, after which the military and resistance groups declared ceasefires to facilitate relief efforts.""We are horrified by reports of a Myanmar regime airstrike on a school in an earthquake-affected area at a time when a ceasefire has been announced. Schools are meant to be a place of safety and opportunity, not collateral in a conflict,"" Britain's minister for Indo-Pacific catherine west said in a statement.""We repeat our call to all parties, particularly the Myanmar military, to refrain from airstrikes, safeguard civilians, and protect civilian infrastructure.""","Local resistance groups and independent media said 20 pupils and 2 teachers died in the attack. Their reports said that as many as 100 people were wounded. The dead students were from grades 2 to 11, with the youngest seven years old. State-run Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper denied the army had carried out the airstrike.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121164028,imgsize-1462892,width-400,resizemode-4/121164028.jpg"
UK farmers pray for rain amid driest spring since 1852,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-farmers-pray-for-rain-amid-driest-spring-since-1852/articleshow/121280018.cms,"Representative AI image

'One extreme to another'





RAMSEY: UK farmers are praying for rain as Britain suffers its driest spring in well over a century, which has left the soil parched and crops stunted from lack of water.At his 400-hectare (988-acre) farm near the eastern town of Peterborough, Luke Abblitt sadly surveyed his fields of thirsty sugar beets and potatoes struggling to grow.Not a drop of rain has fallen since March.""I'm not quite sure how I'm going to handle it on the farm, I'm hoping that we're going to get some rain, if not, then I'll have to somehow magically do something,"" Abblitt, 36, told AFP.The tiny green shoots of the sugar beets poking through the cracked, dusty earth ""should be at least twice the size,"" he sighed.In a neighbouring field, he has just planted potatoes with the help of his father, Clive, toiling to break up the baked soil.A total of 80.6 millimetres (3.1 inches) of rain has fallen since the start of spring, which covers the months of March, April and May, according to the national weather agency.That is well below the all-time low of 100.7 millimetres, which fell in 1852, according to the Met Office.""This spring has so far been the driest for more than a century,"" the Met Office told AFP, cautioning that it would be necessary to wait until the end of May to confirm the record.According to the Environment Agency, levels in the reservoirs have fallen to ""exceptionally low"".It called a meeting of its national drought group last week, at which deputy director of water Richard Thompson said climate change meant ""we will see more summer droughts in the coming decades"".The dry start to the year meant water companies were ""moving water across their regions to relieve the driest areas"", a spokesperson for Water UK, the industry body representing water suppliers, told AFP.Memories linger in Britain of July 2022 when temperatures topped 40 degrees (104 Fahrenheit) for the first time.In a barn, the Abblitts worked side-by-side with a noisy machine packing potatoes harvested last year into 25-kilo sacks.""Potatoes are a lot heavier users of water ... and they're also a lot more high value. So, we desperately need some rain,"" Luke Abblitt said.Without water, a potato ""will only reach a certain stage before it stops and then it won't grow any bigger,"" he added.If his potatoes are stunted he will not be able to sell them to his main clients which are British fish and chip shops.""I need to make sure they're a fair size, because everyone wants big chips, no one wants tiny chips do they?"" he said.The weather is going from ""one extreme to the other,"" he said dejectedly.""We're having a lot of rain in the wintertime, not so much rain in the spring or summer time. We need to adapt our cultivation methods, look at different varieties, different cropping possibly to combat these adverse weather conditions.""In recent years, Britain has been battered by major storms, as well as being hit by floods and heatwaves.""As our climate changes, the likelihood of droughts increases,"" said Liz Bentley, chief executive at the Royal Meteorological Society.""They're likely to become more frequent, and they're likely to be more prolonged,"" she warned.In past years the country used to experience a severe drought every 16 years.""In this current decade, that's increased to one in every five years, and in the next couple of decades, that becomes one in every three years.""And a fall in harvests risks pushing up prices in the supermarkets, she added.Some farmers have begun irrigating their crops earlier than usual, the National Farmers' Union said, calling for investment to improve water storage and collection systems.Vice President Rachel Hallos warned ""extreme weather patterns ... are impacting our ability to feed the nation"".Abblitt applied two years ago for a licence to install an irrigation system on the lands he rents from the local authorities.He is still waiting. ""I'm just praying for the rain,"" he added.","UK farmers are praying for rain as Britain suffers its driest spring in well over a century.

UK strikes EU trade and defence reset in 'new era' for relations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-strikes-eu-trade-and-defence-reset-in-new-era-for-relations/articleshow/121276728.cms,"UK PM Keir Starmer (File photo)





LONDON/BRUSSELS: Britain agreed the most significant reset of defence and trade ties with the European Union since Brexit on Monday after US President Donald Trump's upending of the global order pushed the two sides to move on from their acrimonious divorce.Nearly nine years after it voted to leave the bloc, Britain reached a wide-ranging deal with the EU, including a security and defence pact, fewer restrictions on British food exporters and visitors, and a contentious new fishing agreement.British PM Keir Starmer, who backed remaining in the EU in the Brexit referendum, also bet that offering benefits to Britons such as the use of faster e-gates at EU airports will drown out the cries of ""betrayal"" from Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage. Flanked by EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen and European Council president Antonio Costa at London's Lancaster House, Starmer said the deal marked ""a new era in our relationship"". Britain said the reset would reduce red tape for agricultural producers - making food cheaper - improve energy security and, by 2040, add nearly 9 billion pounds ($12.1 billion) to the economy, which is about 2.6 trillion pounds in size.It is the third deal Britain has struck this month, after agreements with India and the US, and while it is unlikely to lead to an immediate economic boost, it could lift business confidence, drawing much-needed investment. At the heart of the reset is a defence and security pact that will let Britain be part of any joint procurement and pave the way for British companies to take part in a 150 billion euro ($167 billion) programme to rearm Europe.On fishing, British and EU vessels will have access to each other's waters for 12 years in return for a permanent reduction in paperwork and border checks that had prevented small food producers from exporting to Europe. In return, Britain has agreed to the outline of a limited scheme to let young EU and British people live and work in each others' territories for periods. Farage, head of the right-wing Reform UK party, called the deal an ""abject surrender - the end of the fishing industry"".","UK agrees most significant reset of defence and trade ties with the European Union.

A man who tried to help a burglar cash in from the theft of a golden toilet worth £4.74 million ($6.4 million) was spared jail on Monday after a British judge said he had been taken advantage of by the thieves. Frederick Doe , 37, also known as Frederick Sines, was given a suspended sentence at Oxford Crown Court for his role in helping to sell the 18-carat gold fully functioning toilet which was taken in 2019 from Blenheim Palacem, the country mansion where British wartime leader Winston Churchill was born.""Those responsible for this audacious heist, five individuals could be seen on CCTV, were clearly intent on disposing of their ill-gotten gains quickly,"" Judge Ian Pringle told Doe. ""You foolishly agreed to assist.""The toilet was part of a satirical art installation, titled ""America,"" by Italian conceptual artist Maurizio Cattelan , which aimed to poke fun at excessive wealth. It weighed just over 215 pounds (98 kilograms). The value of the gold at the time was 2.8 million pounds and it was insured for nearly 5 million pounds.The piece had previously been on display at The Guggenheim Museum, in New York, which had offered the work to US President Donald Trump during his first term in office after he had asked to borrow a Van Gogh painting.The theft of the toilet - which has never been recovered and is believed to have been cut up and sold - caused considerable damage to the 18th-century property, a UNESCO World Heritage site filled with valuable art and furniture that draws thousands of visitors each year.Of the group who smashed a window to get into the palace before dawn on Sept 14, 2019, only two have been charged and convicted.James Sheen, 40, previously pleaded guilty to burglary, conspiracy and transferring criminal property. Michael Jones, 39, was convicted of burglary at the trial where Doe was convicted. Sheen and Jones will be sentenced June 13.Doe punched his fist in the air as he emerged from court, saying he was a good person who ""got caught up in something I should not have.""The judge said Sheen approached Doe because he had contacts in London's jewelry district.In a WhatsApp message, Doe told Sheen he could ""sell the gold in a second."" Doe said he had no idea the gold was looted and wouldn't have sold stolen gold ""in a million years.""Doe, who was convicted of conspiracy to transfer criminal property, was given a two-year suspended term and ordered to perform 240 hours of unpaid work.""You agreed to assist Mr Sheen without any hope or expectation of a reward for yourself,"" the judge said. ""You no doubt, for the last five-and-a-half years, regret doing (that) for James Sheen every day since your arrest.""","Frederick Doe, 37, was given a suspended sentence for helping to sell the gold toilet.

Tense Rome Meeting: US Vice President Schooled On Trade By EU Chief; Meloni Plays Mediator | Watch

Poll Do you think the new UK-EU Security and Defence Partnership is a positive step forward? Yes, absolutely! No, not really.





The United Kingdom and European Union have agreed a major new security and defence partnership, Downing Street said on Monday, marking what the government called “a historic day” and the start of a new chapter in relations between the two sides.The deal, unveiled during a summit in London, will allow the UK defence industry to participate in the EU’s proposed €150 billion (£129 billion) Security Action for Europe (SAFE) fund, a significant step towards greater military cooperation post-Brexit. According to the UK government, the partnership will support thousands of British jobs and stimulate economic growth.“Today will also see the agreement of the new Security and Defence Partnership, which will pave the way for the UK defence industry to participate in the EU’s proposed new £150 billion Security Action for Europe (SAFE) defence fund supporting thousands of British jobs and boosting growth,” the UK government said in a statement. “At a time of increasing global uncertainty and volatility, this will formalise UK-EU co-operation on defence to ensure Europe’s safety and security. ”Prime Minister Keir Starmer hailed the agreement as a turning point. “It’s time to look forward. To move on from the stale old debates and political fights to find common sense, practical solutions which get the best for the British people,” he said. “We’re ready to work with partners if it means we can improve people’s lives here at home.So that’s what this deal is all about – facing out into the world once again, in the great tradition of this nation. ”The security deal was part of a wider UK-EU strategic agreement that also included a new sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) accord, designed to ease trade in food and drink, reduce border red tape and revive British exports of products such as burgers and sausages. The government claims the measures, alongside closer cooperation on emissions trading and trade protections for sectors like steel, could deliver nearly £9 billion to the UK economy by 2040.Nick Thomas-Symonds, the minister for European Union relations, said: “Today is a historic day, marking the opening of a new chapter in our relationship with the EU that delivers for working people across the UK… Our new UK-EU Strategic Partnership achieves all three objectives. It delivers on jobs, bills and borders.”",The UK and EU have agreed a major new security and defence partnership.

UK judge flagged ‘confidential impediment’ blocking Nirav Modi’s extradition to India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-judge-flagged-confidential-impediment-blocking-nirav-modis-extradition-to-india/articleshow/121251255.cms,"PTI file photo





Nirav Modi’s extradition to India is being held up by a “confidential impediment,” according to a London High Court ruling issued this week, reported PTI. Justice Michael Fordham remarked while rejecting Modi’s latest bail application, noting that a legal barrier—whose details remain undisclosed—is stopping UK authorities from handing over the 54-year-old to India.Modi, who is wanted in India on charges of fraud, money laundering, and witness interference, has been in prison since March 2019. Although the UK government approved his extradition in 2021, the process has not moved forward. The judge said the confidential nature of the issue limits what the court can realistically assess, particularly when reviewing the long delay and the risk of granting bail.“There is a legal reason which relates to confidential proceedings,” Justice Fordham said. The court said that this information is known to Nirav Modi, his lawyers, and the Home Office—but not to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), the Indian authorities, or the court itself.CPS lawyer Nicholas Hearn, representing the Indian side, acknowledged the existence of the issue and said it must be respected, without disclosing further.The confidential matter is widely believed to involve an asylum application, but the court has not confirmed this.Meanwhile, Modi’s legal team argued for bail on health and humanitarian grounds, pointing to physical and mental deterioration and risks in prison. But the judge found that these concerns did not outweigh the likelihood that Modi would flee if released.There are three ongoing criminal cases against Nirav Modi in India, including one by the CBI over fraud linked to Punjab National Bank, another by the Enforcement Directorate for money laundering, and a third for interfering with witnesses. All bail attempts so far have been denied.","Nirav Modi is wanted in India on charges of fraud, money laundering, and witness interference.

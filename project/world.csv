First arrests made in spate of attacks targeting Indians in Ireland,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/first-arrests-made-in-spate-of-attacks-targeting-indians-in-ireland/articleshow/125337458.cms,"Representative image





LONDON: The Indian community in Ireland is relieved as finally the first arrests have taken place following a spate of racist attacks targeting them over the summer.On Friday morning the Gardaí (Ireland’s national police force) announced they had arrested a male in his 30s and a male juvenile teen for the brutal attack on the Indian Amazon employee in Tallaght, Dublin, on July 19, which was the first attack to hit the headlines in India.“Both males are currently detained under Section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984 at Garda stations in South Dublin. Investigations are ongoing,” the Garda told TOI.A highly-skilled Indian national, aged in his 40s, was stripped naked, stabbed and left almost for dead by a gang near a roundabout in Kilnamanagh, Tallaght. He had only arrived in Ireland a week earlier and his 11-month-old baby and wife were still in India.Local resident Jennifer Murray, who found him, said: “They gashed his forehead open, punched him in the head, threw him to the ground, and he was left with massive head injuries. They removed his trousers, underwear, phone, bank card, shoes, everything. They very easily could have killed him.”This was followed by numerous other attacks targeting persons of Indian origin in Ireland over the summer. There have been no arrests in any of the other cases.However the attacks, mostly perpetrated by children and teenagers, stopped after schools re-opened in Sept and the nights grew darker.Some Aditya Mandal, an AI professional from West Bengal working in Dublin, said: “The Indian community welcomes this positive development and expresses its sincere gratitude to the Irish govt, An Garda Síochána, and the Indian embassy. We remain confident that justice will be delivered and that the culprits will be held accountable.”“The whole system is very bureaucratic. To make an arrest they need to go through loops of the legal system and that is why the delay. It is not like the UK,” explained Anand Kumar Pandey, a member of the Ireland-India Council. “The Indian community is very happy about the arrests. The process is slow but it seems like all the efforts we made put the pressure on.”","Indian community in Ireland is relieved as finally the first arrests have taken place following a spate of racist attacks targeting them over the summer.

Candace Owens explains her list of “verifiable lies” told after Charlie Kirk’s assassination





Image via Candace/Podcast

She said the first lie was the story that Mikey McCoy had “blood all over him.” She said this story was made up and was told by Pastor Rob McCoy.

The second lie, she said, came from Alex Clark and Andrew Kolvet. She said they pushed a story that Charlie Kirk was a “committed evangelical” who only liked Catholic buildings. Owens said this was not true.

The third lie was a strange story that Charlie Kirk’s “strong bones” stopped a 30-06 bullet. She said Andrew Kolvet pushed this and that it made no sense.

The fourth lie, she said, was the claim that Charlie “never blinked” in his support for Israel. Owens said this was not true.

For the fifth lie, she said TPUSA told people that Mikey McCoy first called his dad during the crisis. Owens said this story was also false.

The sixth lie was about Terryl Farnsworth, the AV worker. She said TPUSA claimed police told him to remove cameras. Owens said her video review shows this did not happen.

The seventh lie was the claim that Farnsworth moved SD cards because “people were stealing them.” She said this made no sense because SD cards are cheap and cameras are expensive.

The eighth lie came from Alex Clark, who said there was “no bad blood” between Ben Shapiro and Charlie Kirk. Owens said that was “propaganda.”

The ninth lie was that TPUSA’s yearly audits proved nothing odd. Candace Owens said this was misleading because Doge worked differently from normal TPUSA work.

The tenth lie was calling Mikey McCoy a “hero.” Candace Owens said this was not fair because he did not call 911 right away.





Candace Owens spoke on her podcast on November 13, 2025. She said she found ten “verifiable lies” that she believes Turning Point USA (TPUSA) told after Charlie Kirk was killed. Charlie Kirk was shot in the neck on September 10, 2025, at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah. The next day, 22-year-old Tyler James Robinson was arrested for the shooting. Owens said she will keep talking about this case because she feels she is getting “very close” to the real truth, and she believes some people at TPUSA are upset with her for this.In her show, Candace Owens said TPUSA gave wrong or confusing stories about what happened that day. She said some stories made people sound more heroic, more loyal, or more important than they really were. She also said some stories changed facts about Charlie Kirk, his beliefs, his staff, and what happened at the scene.Candace Owens then shared the ten lies she says TPUSA spread. She said her list is not final, but these were the lies she wanted to clear up right now.Candace Owens said she will keep talking about the Charlie Kirk case on her Candace podcast.Also Read: Candace Owens And Allie Beth Stuckey Spark Big Drama As New Words On Charlie Kirk Assassination Go Viral","Candace Owens spoke on her podcast on November 13, 2025.

After a year of self-exile, journalist Olivia Nuzzi is back with her bombshell book 'American Canto' due to be released next month, with threadbare details of her affair with 71-year-old RFK Jr, without naming him. Nuzzi was fired from her job at New York Magazine after her secret romance with RFK Jr came to the public and her engagement with journalist Ryan Lizza was also canceled.32-year-old Nuzzi disappeared from the public eye and reportedly spent time in Malibu writing her book. The book reveals that she was in love with Kennedy but only after Kennedy told her 'I love you' first. Kennedy used to calle her 'Livvy' and wrote poems to her; he told her he'd take a bullet for her and also expressed his desire for her to have his child.“She writes that the first few times Kennedy said he loved her, she did not say it back,” the New York Times reported in its article 'Olivia Nuzzi did it all for love'. “Yet she knew she felt the same. ‘I love him, I thought. Oh no. I love him so much.’ They spoke often and were intimate enough for her to see him flossing his teeth, his dopp kit overflowing with prescriptions.”Nuzzi wrote that the mutual infatuation consumed her but it was never consummated, keeping the nature of their relationship ambiguous.Nuzzi revealed that though Trump's health secretary publicly claims to be ""sober"" for decades, he told her that he was taking psychedelics and smoked the powerful drug dimethyltryptamine, or DMT.""She didn’t care that he was 39 years older than her. She liked him just the way he was. They both 'moved through the world with amused detachment and deep sensitivity, contradictions that worked somehow in concert',"" the NYT noted.When the affair became public, Kennedy Jr dismissed it and said he had just met her once for a piece she was writing. Nuzzi wrote in her book that as news broke of their relationship in September 2024, he told her, “If it’s just sex, I can survive it.” She told him she would do whatever he needed her to do.",Olivia Nuzzi was fired from her job at New York Magazine after her secret romance with RFK Jr came to the public.

Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the Crown Prince of Dubai, is not just a figurehead of royalty—he is a man of extraordinary wealth, influence, and interests. With an estimated personal net worth ranging from $1 billion to $2 billion, Sheikh Hamdan is one of the wealthiest and most influential royals in the world. This fortune is drawn from a variety of sources, including luxurious real estate, superyachts, private jets, and rare car collections. However, these estimates often focus only on his personal assets, and his actual wealth is likely far greater when considering his family's assets and the extensive holdings tied to the Al Maktoum family.In fact, some reports estimate that the Al Maktoum family, led by Sheikh Hamdan's father, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, has a net worth that ranges between $14 billion to $18 billion, a figure that is widely cited but likely underestimates the full scale of their wealth. In reality, due to the private nature of royal assets and the lack of public disclosures, the family's true wealth could be much higher than these estimates.Sheikh Hamdan's personal net worth, estimated between $1 billion and $2 billion, is significant but only scratches the surface of his family's total wealth. His fortune is tied to a combination of private investments, his role as Crown Prince, and assets across various industries. Below is a breakdown of his key wealth sources:Sheikh Hamdan’s love for luxury yachts is well known, and he is the proud owner of several high-end vessels:In addition to his yachts, Sheikh Hamdan has access to private jets and notably, a Boeing 747-400 from the Dubai Royal Air Wing, valued between $100 million to $270 million, offering luxurious interiors for personal and official traveSheikh Hamdan is renowned for his collection of luxury cars, many of which are limited-edition supercars. His garage reportedly includes:Along with his love for high-performance sports cars, Sheikh Hamdan has an affinity for luxury SUVs, particularly the Mercedes AMG G63, which is said to be his favourite vehicle.Sheikh Hamdan’s wealth extends far beyond cars and yachts; he is also deeply invested in real estate. His properties span Dubai and include:Sheikh Hamdan’s wealth is not confined to personal residences; his real estate investments form a substantial part of his overall fortune. Through Zabeel Investments and other holdings, he has acquired a mix of luxury residential towers, commercial developments, mansion compounds, and hospitality assets. These investments reflect both his personal tastes for opulence and his strategic role in shaping Dubai’s urban and economic landscape.This estimate combines his official residences, private estates, high-value real estate projects, and luxury lifestyle assets such as superyachts and jets. While these numbers provide a snapshot of Sheikh Hamdan’s tangible wealth, his actual financial influence and holdings likely extend far beyond these figures, particularly when considering his family’s overall fortune and the value of assets tied to the Al Maktoum dynasty.Sheikh Hamdan’s love for animals is well known, and he maintains an exclusive private zoo separate from Zabeel Palace. Located near Nad Al Sheba and close to the Dubai Desert Conservation Reserve, this private zoo houses a diverse collection of exotic animals, including white lions, giraffes, elephants, and tigers. The zoo is meticulously designed with state-of-the-art facilities, including specialized veterinary care and spacious habitats tailored to the needs of the animals.In addition to his exotic collection, Sheikh Hamdan is a passionate falconer, preserving and promoting falconry—a treasured Emirati heritage sport. He owns a private falconry centre equipped with a specialized falcon hospital, providing surgeries, X-rays, and emergency care for his prized birds. The Crown Prince actively participates in falconry competitions such as the Fazza Championship for Falconry and supports international exhibitions, showcasing his commitment to sustaining this centuries-old tradition.Sheikh Hamdan frequently shares glimpses of his animal kingdom and falconry pursuits on Instagram, where his 17 million+ followers see him interacting with elephants, giraffes, lions, and falcons. These posts highlight not only his love for wildlife but also his active role in conservation and cultural preservation.","Crown Prince Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum is a key member of Dubai's royal family.

When and how to watch the Northern Lights





What makes this Aurora event unique





Understanding the science behind the Northern Lights





How geomagnetic storms are classified





Tips to improve your chances of seeing the Northern Lights





Find a dark viewing spot far from city lights and face north for the best view. Light pollution can wash out faint auroras, so rural or elevated areas are ideal.

Use your smartphone camera as many modern phone cameras are more sensitive to light than the human eye and can detect faint auroras before they become visible.

Let your eyes adjust to the dark for at least 20 to 30 minutes and avoid looking at bright screens. This allows your vision to adapt to low light and makes it easier to spot subtle colour shifts in the sky.

Dress warmly because temperatures can drop significantly at night, especially in northern regions. Layered clothing, gloves, and hats are essential for comfort during long viewing periods.

Be patient. The Northern Lights are unpredictable and can appear suddenly. Staying outdoors for an extended period improves your chances of witnessing the spectacle.

What to do if you miss tonight’s display

The night sky across the United States is expected to dazzle millions as the Northern Lights, or aurora borealis, become visible in over twenty states from November 11 to 12, 2025. This rare spectacle is fueled by heightened solar activity, including several powerful solar eruptions that send charged particles hurtling toward Earth at incredible speeds. As these particles interact with the planet’s magnetic field, they create stunning displays of shifting light in shades of green, pink, and violet, dancing across the sky in dynamic, ever-changing patterns. The phenomenon, usually confined to polar regions, may reach as far south as states like Kansas and Virginia, offering a rare opportunity for Americans to witness one of nature’s most captivating and colourful celestial events.The Northern Lights, or aurora borealis, are expected to dazzle skywatchers across the United States tonight, offering a rare opportunity for millions to witness one of nature’s most mesmerising displays. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), enhanced solar activity has created ideal conditions for auroral visibility, pushing the colourful phenomenon much farther south than usual.If weather conditions remain clear, shimmering curtains of green, pink, and violet light could illuminate the skies across multiple regions, from the Pacific Northwest to the Northeast. This widespread coverage marks one of the most extensive Northern Lights forecasts in recent years, making tonight a particularly exciting occasion for stargazers and photographers alike.Here’s the list of US states:Timing is crucial for observing the aurora borealis. NOAA’s three-day geomagnetic forecast predicts that activity will peak late in the evening and continue into the early hours of 12 November. The best viewing windows are expected to be between 4 pm and 10 pm EST (2100–0300 GMT) for minor to moderate activity, and between 10 pm and 1 am EST (0300–0600 GMT) for stronger geomagnetic storm levels.During these peak hours, observers may witness luminous arcs or shimmering curtains of light dancing across the northern horizon. In some areas, the lights could stretch overhead in glowing ribbons that shift and ripple as magnetic fields interact.The combination of multiple CMEs and an exceptionally powerful solar flare makes this event stand out from recent auroral displays. The convergence of these solar bursts increases the likelihood of intense geomagnetic disturbances. Such interactions can create stacked auroras, where layers of colour overlap, giving the sky an even richer appearance. The last time auroras of this strength reached similar latitudes was during strong solar events several years ago. Additionally, solar activity tends to rise and fall in roughly 11-year cycles known as solar cycles. We are currently nearing the peak of Solar Cycle 25, which explains the recent increase in both sunspots and flares that are the main drivers of auroral events, producing spectacular skies visible to many observers across high-latitude regions.The Northern Lights occur when streams of charged particles from the Sun, known as the solar wind, reach Earth and interact with gases in the upper atmosphere. These collisions release energy in the form of light, producing the stunning patterns that dance across the sky.Oxygen atoms are responsible for the green and red colours most commonly seen, while nitrogen produces blue and purple hues. The exact colours depend on which gases are hit and at what altitude the interactions take place.This week’s event is particularly special because several coronal mass ejections (CMEs), enormous bursts of plasma and magnetic energy from the Sun, are headed toward Earth. These CMEs are part of heightened solar activity linked to an X5.1-class solar flare, the most powerful flare recorded so far in 2025. When these charged particles collide with Earth’s magnetic field, they can cause strong geomagnetic storms, expanding the auroral oval and pushing the Northern Lights much farther south than usual.Geomagnetic storms are measured on a five-level scale from G1 (minor) to G5 (extreme). These classifications are determined by the strength of the disturbance in Earth’s magnetic field.A G3 storm is strong enough to make auroras visible at mid-latitudes, while a G4 storm can extend the visibility range even farther south and may affect some radio communications and satellite operations. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has issued a G4 geomagnetic storm watch, suggesting that much of the continental United States could witness the aurora. It is rare for auroras to reach such southern latitudes, making this a potentially historic event for skywatchers.While space weather determines when the aurora will occur, your viewing experience depends largely on preparation and local conditions. Experts recommend several strategies to increase your odds of seeing the lights clearly.If cloudy skies or poor visibility spoil your view tonight, there is still hope. The sequence of solar eruptions means geomagnetic activity could remain elevated for several days. Keep an eye on forecast updates through NOAA’s channels or dedicated aurora-tracking apps, as new opportunities may arise later this week.Even if you miss this particular show, solar activity is expected to stay strong for the remainder of the year, providing additional chances for aurora sightings across mid-latitudes.","The Northern Lights, or aurora borealis, are expected to dazzle skywatchers across the United States tonight.

‘Deport Him…’: Team Trump Moves To Strip Mamdani Of US Citizenship After NYC Win

New York will survive, but will get worse before it gets better







Billionaire real estate investor Barry Sternlicht, the chairman and CEO of Starwood Capital Group, said New York City under new mayor Zohran Mamdani will turn into Mumbai as he pledged to freeze rents because tenants' incomes have stagnated. Sternlicht who has both commercial and residential holdings in NYC said when one neighbor finds out that their neighbor is not paying, they stop paying and thus NYC will turn into Mumbai.“Over $100 million, every project in New York has to go union, and it’s super expensive. It leads to extremely expensive housing. And other developers have tried to cut deals with the unions, but they rule New York, and that’s one of the key reasons the blue states are so expensive and they’re so difficult to add supply of housing to,” Sternlicht said in an interview with CNBC Property Play, reacting to Mamdani's win.“And then the far left gets really nuts and says the tenants don’t have to pay. Well, you can’t kick them out if they don’t pay. So the neighbor finds out the neighbor isn’t paying, and they don’t pay, and the next guy doesn’t pay, and then you’re basically going to turn New York City into Mumbai,"" he said.Sternlicht said his New York team is considering leaving the city as well.“The core issues are not what he’s focusing on. We need to increase housing.That’s not going to happen easily, right? You need serious subsidies from the government if they want us to work with unions. The unions have to be more accommodative on their work laws and the wages and everything else, otherwise you can’t add economically,"" he said. Sternlicht said rent freezing is not the solution but increasing housing is.Sternlicht said he believed New York will survive but will first gets a lot worse before it gets better. “People are working really hard. Just how do we help others to do well and believe in the American dream? That’s probably a better message for a leader in the city than saying, let’s just tax everyone who’s been successful, force them to leave and then have to rely on Washington for handouts to basically keep the city going,” Sternlicht added.","Barry Sternlicht, the chairman and CEO of Starwood Capital Group, said New York City under new mayor Zohran Mamdani will turn into Mumbai.

Just months after its opening, a portion of a highway bridge in China’s Sichuan province collapsed on Tuesday, giving in to a combination of a landslide and apparent structural weakness.The Hongqi bridge in Maerkang, is a 758-metre-long span on a national highway designed to improve travel between Sichuan, China’s central regions, and Tibet, Reuters reported.Footage from the scene shows debris slamming onto the bridge, with part of the span breaking away and falling into the river below. A large plume of dust rose from the collapse site as rubble scattered across the surrounding valley.The bridge was only completed earlier this year, a milestone that the contractor, Sichuan Road & Bridge Group, shared in a video posted on social media.Local authorities confirmed that the incident occurred when landslides struck a mountainside overlooking the structure.However, there were no casualties as the bridge was already closed to traffic before the collapse.Police had shut the structure on Monday afternoon after engineers spotted cracks on slopes and nearby roads, and detected shifts in the mountain terrain above the bridge. Officials in Maerkang said that the closure decision was taken as soon as the cracks and ground movement were detected, and that worsening instability on Tuesday directly led to the collapse, New York Post reported.According to the local government, conditions deteriorated rapidly the following day.On Tuesday afternoon, the weakening mountainside gave way, triggering landslides that destroyed the approach bridge and roadbed.The destroyed bridge section was part of a key highway link intended to ease travel between Sichuan, China’s interior, and the Tibetan Plateau.","A portion of a highway bridge in China's Sichuan province collapsed on Tuesday, giving in to a combination of a landslide and apparent structural weakness.

Nikki Haley Warns Donald Trump of ‘Strategic Disaster’ as 50% US Tariff on India Nears Deadline





Amid the ongoing Christian-Hinduism controversy, Nalin Haley , the son of former US ambassador to UN Nikki Haley, has spoken about his unique journey in finding his faith in a multi-faith family. In an interview with UnHerd, the 24-year-old Indian-origin MAGA voice said he was confused over religion in his childhood. His maternal grandparents who were almost his surrogate parents, followed Sikhism while his parents were Protestant Christians.Haley said he immersed himself in books on world religions to find out what he should follow when other kids of his age were reading about cars and dinosaurs. Eventually, he concluded that Christianity is the true faith but the conclusion was preceded by a spiritual experience that he did not detail in the interview.“I needed to research my own faith better in terms of the history, the early beliefs, the Church Fathers,” he said. “When I did that, I felt as though anyone who does that kind of research will walk away a Catholic.”The interview comes as Hindu Indian-origin politicians in the US are facing unprecedented attacks over their religion. Vice President JD Vance recently said he would like to see his wife Usha Vance converted to Christianity.Though JD clarified that Usha Vance has no intention of converting, the episode showed how MAGA is Christian nationalists at core and unapologetic about it.Haley said he chose his political path too in a similar fashion. I was not just going to have the same political views as my parents,” he said adding that he supported Nikki Haley in the 2024 Republican primary only to be a ""good son"". “I didn’t and was never going to be an advocate for a view that I did not have,"" he said.

How Trump 'knew about the underage girls in Epstein's house'







kThe MAGA chief has dragged several other high-profile names into the infamous Epstein scandal, which Democrats have accused him of being a major part of.US President Donald Trump has said he will ask the Department of Justice (DOJ) to investigate big figures linked to pedophile and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein , starting a political fight over newly released emails by Democrats.Trump announced on Friday in a Truth Social post, claiming Democrats were using the “Epstein Hoax” to distract from a government shutdown and other issues. “Now that the Democrats are using the Epstein Hoax, involving Democrats, not Republicans, to try and deflect from their disastrous SHUTDOWN, and all of their other failures, I will be asking A.G. Pam Bondi, and the Department of Justice, together with our great patriots at the FBI, to investigate Jeffrey Epstein’s involvement and relationship with Bill Clinton, Larry Summers, Reid Hoffman, J.P. Morgan, Chase, and many other people and institutions, to determine what was going on with them, and him,” Trump said.He continued, “This is another Russia, Russia, Russia Scam, with all arrows pointing to the Democrats. Records show that these men, and many others, spent large portions of their life with Epstein, and on his ‘Island.’ Stay tuned!!!”The post came days after the House Oversight Committee released a series of emails involving Epstein in which he spoke about Trump.In a 2018 exchange about Michael Cohen’s guilty plea, Epstein said, “I know how dirty donald is.” In another message that year, he wrote, “its wild. because I am the one able to take him down.”Other emails have raised further questions. In an April message sent to author Michael Wolff, Epstein claimed Trump “knew about the girls.” Lawmakers also showed a 2011 email to Ghislaine Maxwell in which Epstein wrote, “I want you to realize that the dog that hasn’t barked is trump.” He added that a person identified by lawmakers as a victim “spent hours at my house with” Trump, saying, “He has never once been mentioned. ”Trump has repeatedly denied knowing about Epstein’s abuse of underage girls and said they fell out in the early 2000s. His new call for investigations also comes as the House prepares for a vote on whether to force the release of long-withheld federal files related to Epstein, which the Justice Department has refused to make public despite earlier assurances from officials, including Attorney General Pam Bondi.","US President Donald Trump has said he will ask the Department of Justice to investigate big figures linked to pedophile and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

The TOI correspondent from Washington:

'No Talent In U.S.': Trump BURNS MAGA Base For India Reset? What It Means For Indian Workers





Tapping into the MAGA base’s disaffection with the job market, rebellious Republican lawmaker Marjorie Taylor Greene (MTG), who is already on a warpath with President Trump on various issues, announced on Thursday she will introduce legislation to aggressively phase out the H-1B visa program, which she brands a ""corrupt"" tool for ""mass replacement"" of American workers.The proposal, unveiled in a viral X post viewed nearly 2 million times, targets Big Tech, AI firms, hospitals, and other industries accused of abusing the system to undercut US “talent” with “cheaper” foreign labor, mainly from India, whose nationals get around 70 percent of H-1B visas. Greene's bill would eliminate the program entirely, stripping its pathway to citizenship and forcing visa holders to return home upon expiration.A narrow exemption allows 10,000 annual visas for medical professionals like doctors and nurses—vital amid US healthcare shortages—but even this cap phases out over 10 years to foster a ""domestic pipeline"" of American physicians. The measure also bars non-citizen medical students from Medicare-funded residencies, citing last year's imbalance where over 9,000 US graduates went unmatched while 5,000 foreign-born doctors secured spots.A staunch ""America First"" proponent, Greene argues the H-1B—intended for temporary, high-skill gaps—has devolved into a decades-long scam displacing innovative Americans in tech, engineering, manufacturing, and beyond, a sketchy allegation lacking factual basis despite stray cases of fraud. ""Big Tech, AI giants, hospitals, and industries across the board have abused the H-1B system to cut out our own people,"" she declared in a video statement, emphasizing faith in US ingenuity: ""Americans are the most talented people in the world. .. If we want the next generation to have the American Dream, we must stop replacing them and start investing in them."" Several studies and surveys challenge such assertions, showing shortcoming in the US education system and a chronic shortage of American workers in specialty professions.Support is coalescing among MAGA hardliners echoing Greene's nativist fervor. Far-right activist Laura Loomer, an MTG critic and Trump loyalist, has also long railed against H-1Bs as ""indentured servitude"" that depresses wages, aligning with Greene's narrative despite their mutual antagonism. Steve Bannon, the ex-Trump strategist, blasted the program on his War Room podcast, calling for it to be ""zeroed-out"" to halt ""foreign worker replacements. "" Bipartisan reformers like Iowa Republican Senator Chuck Grassley and Dick Durbin, Democrat from Illinois, have long called for H-1B/L-1 visa reform for fraud prevention, though not full elimination.The Trump administration has been walking a tightrope on the issue, with the President appearing to defend the program earlier this week, insisting the US lacks ""certain talents"" for tech and defense roles, and later sending out his surrogates to finesse the issue after a MAGA uproar, with administration officials suggesting Trump wants foreign workers to train Americans and then return to their home country. The President has previously been all-in for H-1B visas.But such is the MAGA fervor that officials and lawmakers who had previously supported the H-1B program are cautiously reeling back. In a notable pivot this week, Florida Congressman Byron Donald, mocked by MAGA as H1Byron, told a conservative host Benny Johnson he'd ""love to see the program go away completely."" Florida governor Ron Desantis recently directed the state's public universities to halt using H-1B hires for “non-elite roles” such as assistant athletic coaches, media relations specialists, public policy professors, psychologists, and graphic designers—positions he argued could and should be filled by qualified Americans or Florida residentsDespite such turnaround, chances of MTG’s proposal succeeding are considered slim given her track record of 70 dud bills in the House, leading critics to call her a ""stunt legislator,"" who thrives on headlines. In recent weeks, she has gone on a rampage against Trump, challenging his claim that prices are dropping, demanding release of the Epstein files, and complaining the President is spending too much time on foreign affairs at the expense of domestic priorities.","Republican lawmaker Marjorie Taylor Greene (MTG) announced on Thursday she will introduce legislation to aggressively phase out the H-1B visa program.

US vice president JD Vance is drawing flak after making a joke about former President Joe Biden dying during an interview on Fox News. The moment went viral and triggered Democrats, who called the comment insensitive and irresponsible.The exchange happened during a conversation with host Sean Hannity, who asked Vance whether he feels prepared to take over the presidency if something were to happen to Donald Trump. The question comes at a time when Trump’s own health has been in a questionable state, especially after he underwent a sudden MRI scan last month. It was his second so-called yearly check-up in only six months.Vance brushed aside concerns about 79-year-old Trump’s health and instead took a swipe at 82-year-old Biden. He insisted Trump is “very healthy” and then added, “But if I served under Joe Biden, I’d probably be worried every minute of every day that he was going to croak and that I’d have to become president. Like I’d never be able to sleep. I’d always have my cellphone as loud as possible.” He laughed, and Hannity joined in.Dems said the sly comment crossed a line. They said that joking about a political rival’s death is beneath the office of the vice president.Several Democratic commentators described the moment as “absolutely disgusting,” while others accused Vance of trying to distract from ongoing questions about Trump’s own physical condition.The questions regarding POTUS's health have only intensified in recent weeks. Trump has been seen with bruising on his hand, which he covers with concealer, and with visibly swollen ankles. The White House has said the bruise is the result of frequent handshakes combined with aspirin use. Trump has also appeared tired, dizzy during daytime events, leading some Democrats to suggest he may be experiencing cognitive decline.","JD Vance made the joke during an interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity.

Social media did not hold any punches, trolling the US president's granddaughter.

I hope the poor girl won't have to cheat like her dad to win.

Donald Trump's granddaughter Kai Trump’s long-awaited Golf debut ended in disappointment on Thursday, with the 18-year-old finishing dead last after a sponsor exemption placed her directly in the spotlight.The teenager struggled from the opening holes and quickly fell out of contention on the LPGA Tour, despite arriving with a huge online following and advice from her step-dad and professional golfer Tiger Woods.Her appearance at The ANNIKA, a $3.25 million tournament in Florida, had drawn heavy crowds early in the day. Around 200 spectators packed around to watch her first shot, pushing up against Secret Service agents and lifting their phones to capture the moment. Some even held out flags in hope of Kai’s autograph, reports the Daily Mail.But the excitement faded fast. By the fourth hole, as Kai slipped to four over par, only around 50 spectators remained. By the end of her round she was 13 over and sitting at the very bottom of the leaderboard.The event organisers had made little effort to hide why she was chosen. Kai’s surname, her presence as a YouTuber and the attention she brings were key reasons behind the exemption.Kai found eight of the fourteen fairways and often outdrove her playing partners, Germany’s Olivia Cowan and major winner Hinako Shibuno. “It was pretty cool because I know I hit it far, but kind of playing with the best players in the world and being literally right there or even outdriving on some of the holes, it felt pretty good,” she said.Her real difficulties came with approach shots and putting, landing only seven greens in regulation.Kai closed with nine bogeys and two double bogeys. “I was definitely more nervous than I expected,” she said. “Being my first LPGA event, now I kind of know how it goes.”Kai said that she is still a high-school senior and the youngest in the field.","Kai Trump, 18, finished dead last after a sponsor exemption placed her directly in the spotlight.

Marjorie Taylor Greene sent thousands of foreign workers into a spit after announcing a plan to phase out the H-1B visa programme. This move deepens internal MAGA divisions over immigration and future of the American workforce.The Republican congresswoman said her goal is to “END the mass replacement of American workers” by shutting down the visa route that allows highly skilled professionals from foreign countries to work in the United States.Her intervention arrives at a time when US President Donald Trump is defending the need for specialised foreign talent, H1-B visas and green cards by saying that America does not have enough domestic talent and needs help from abroad to fill important jobs in sectors like technology and defence. This statement by the GOP leader has been seen as a betrayal by some MAGA hardliners, who argue that Trump has stepped back from his ""America First"" agenda.Greene said on X: “I am introducing a bill to END the mass replacement of American workers by aggressively phasing out the H1B program. Big Tech, AI giants, hospitals, and industries across the board have abused the H-1B system to cut out our own people. Americans are the most talented people in the world, and I have full faith in the American people.I serve Americans only, and I will ALWAYS put Americans first.”She added that her proposal “ELIMINATES the corrupt H-1B program and puts AMERICANS FIRST again in tech, healthcare, engineering, manufacturing, and every industry that keeps this country running!! If we want the next generation to have the American Dream, we must stop replacing them and start investing in them.”The H-1B visa is widely relied upon by American technology companies such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon to fill roles in areas requiring advanced technical qualifications, according to Newsweek. Around 400,000 visas were approved in 2024, most of them renewals rather than first-time applications.Greene’s bill includes one temporary exemption. She says 10,000 visas per year could still be issued to medical professionals like doctors and nurses, but this would also be phased out over ten years.Her stance stands in contrast to Trump’s recent comments on Fox News, where he defended maintaining the programme. He argued that the United States does not currently have enough trained workers for certain roles in technology and defence. “No, you don’t. You don’t have certain talents,” he said, adding that “people have to learn!” He also said: “You can’t take people off an unemployment line and say 'I’m gonna put you into a factory where we’re gonna make missiles. ' It doesn't work that way.”In September, Trump introduced a $100,000 annual fee for new applicants and increased oversight of the system.",Marjorie Taylor Greene announced a plan to phase out the H-1B visa programme.

An online exchange between ex-DOGE lead Vivek Ramaswamy and Indian-origin MAGA ally Dinesh D’Souza has stirred fresh row inside MAGA circles, exposing simmering tensions over race, education and who counts as an acceptable standard-bearer for the movement, while Donald Trump and his H1-B comments are still in the frayRamaswamy is weighing a run for Ohio governor, and posted a detailed plan, calling for a reset of the education system. “Time to fix K-12 education by bringing literacy & numeracy standards back to public schools… It won’t happen overnight, but this is how we get serious about making America great again. Ohio is ready to lead the way,” he posted on X.D’Souza jumped in with a comment that mocked white culture and claimed that it would be ironic if or when Ramaswamy will raise the ""prospect of white kids"" with education: “How ironic it will be if a brown American like Vivek actually helps to fix education and raise the prospects of white kids, while all the professional whiteys on X continue their idle boasting about how they too could get us to the moon, ‘just like some white dudes did in 1969. ’”The remark fed into an ongoing conversation about whether MAGA is willing to embrace a non-white candidate in a leadership role, especially one who does not fit the traditional mould of a “white American male” conservative. Ramaswamy even drew flak last month for celebrating Halloween with some far-right Republicans calling for his deportation,At the same time, the wider debate over America’s education system is colliding with Donald Trump’s recent shift on the immigration issue.Earlier this week, Trump showed a softer line on H-1B visas, saying the United States “doesn’t have certain talents” and must bring in specialised workers to stay competitive. The admission angered some of his loyalists, who accused him of contradicting the movement’s long-standing rhetoric on 'American First. 'Furthermore, Ramaswamy faced fire last year for earlier comments in which he criticised American culture and accused it of celebrating “mediocrity."" He also said this ""culture"" was one of the main reasons the US administration hires foreigners for high-end tech companies.In a December 2024 post, he said: “The reason top tech companies often hire foreign-born & first-generation engineers over ‘native’ Americans isn’t because of an innate American IQ deficit (a lazy & wrong explanation). A key part of it comes down to the c-word: culture.

Former representative Matt Gaetz has denied the allegation that he had sex with a 17-year-old high school junior after a newly unsealed batch of court documents detailed her account and the vulnerable circumstances that led her into contact with the Florida Republican, Newsweek reported.This came a year after the House Ethics Committee report found “substantial evidence” that Gaetz allegedly “regularly paid women for engaging in sexual activity with him,” “engaged in sexual activity with a 17-year-old girl” in 2017, used or possessed illegal drugs, and accepted gifts beyond what is permissible.He withdrew his nomination to serve as President Donald Trump’s attorney general last year amid scrutiny of the ethics investigation and questions over whether he could secure enough support from Republican senators in the confirmation process.

Victim A said she did not inform Representative Gaetz that she was under 18 at the time, nor did he ask her age.""Gaetz, who has denied ever having sex with her, was investigated by the Justice Department but not charged, partly due to concerns about her potential credibility under cross-examination.

Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Powers Set To Grow As Shehbaz Govt Mulls 27th Constitution Amendment

Military reforms: Asim Munir at the helm



Judicial restructuring: Federal constitutional court



Political reactions



What next







Pakistan’s National Assembly on Wednesday passed the 27th constitutional amendment bill, granting sweeping powers to the military in general and country’s army chief Asim Munir in specific, and restructuring the judiciary.The vote, held amid a ruckus in the lower house, saw 234 lawmakers in favour and only four against, speaker Ayaz Sadiq announced. The session was attended by top political leaders, including Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, PML-N President Nawaz Sharif, and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari.The amendment comes at a time of heightened political tension in Pakistan, with the ruling coalition seeking to consolidate control over key defence and judicial institutions.The legislation follows earlier Senate approval, where it received 64 votes in favour and no opposition, as the opposition benches boycotted proceedings.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif hailed the passage as a demonstration of national unity, saying the house exhibited solidarity. He also condemned a recent terrorist incident in Wana, drawing parallels to the Army Public School massacre, and praised law enforcement for securing the safety of students and cadets.The amendment elevates Pakistan army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir to the newly created role of Chief of Defence Forces, giving him constitutional authority over all three branches: army, navy, and air force. Honorary five-star ranks such as field marshal, marshal of the air force, and admiral of the fleet remain lifetime titles. According to the country's law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, the reform “aims to bring constitutional oversight to defence appointments while preserving military honour and tradition.The bill also establishes a federal constitutional court (FCC) to handle constitutional and provincial matters, leaving the Supreme Court to focus on civil and criminal cases. The FCC will have equal representation from all provinces and the power to take suo motu notices on constitutional petitions. The Judicial Commission will oversee judge transfers; refusal of a transfer will be treated as retirement.The ruling coalition, including PML-N, PPP, MQM-P, and allies, backed the amendment. Opposition lawmakers condemned it as unconstitutional. PTI chairman Gohar Ali Khan called it the “Baku Amendments” and accused the government of undermining democracy. Mehmood Khan Achakzai of PkMAP protested by tearing a copy of the bill in the house.The amendment now returns to the Senate for final approval before becoming law. Analysts say the 27th amendment significantly strengthens Munir’s role in Pakistan’s military hierarchy while altering judicial oversight, marking a shift in Pakistan’s institutional framework.(With input from agencies, Dawn)","The amendment elevates Pakistan army chief Asim Munir to the newly created role of Chief of Defence Forces.

Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Powers Set To Grow As Shehbaz Govt Mulls 27th Constitution Amendment

Why it matters

The big picture

The Field Marshal’s expanding power evokes a hybrid of Pakistan’s two most dominant military rulers:

Ayub Khan, who introduced centralized presidential control and laid the foundations for military-led governance.

Zia-ul-Haq, who used the Army and Islamization to seize power, marginalize the judiciary, and suppress civilian opposition.

Munir is consolidating power not through martial law, but via constitutional amendments passed by a pliant parliament.

If Zia’s coup was loud and brutal against a strong popular leadership, Munir’s is silent, yet possibly more far reaching, being done through a political front office that’s pliant and dependent on the Army for authority. With Imran Khan in prison, any opposition will come from the streets and the troubled insurgencies to the west of Islamabad.

Pranab Dhal Samanta in the Economic Times

Zoom in

The transformation follows the India-Pakistan conflict in May 2025, a four-day exchange of air and missile strikes after the Pahalgam terror attack.

India’s Operation Sindoor targeted Pakistani airbases, radars, and command centers.

Pakistan requested a ceasefire after intense damage - a request reportedly initiated by Pakistan’s DGMO.

Donald Trump, who claimed to have brokered the truce(India has repeatedly denied the US President's claims), was effusively thanked by Munir and PM Shehbaz Sharif. Trump now calls Munir his “favorite field marshal.”

The Financial Times described their dynamic as a “bromance,” with Trump showcased on billboards across Pakistan alongside Munir and Sharif.

This international validation was followed by Munir’s promotion to Field Marshal, the second such promotion in Pakistan’s history - and the first codified under the Constitution.

Between the lines

This isn’t just about military command - it’s about rewriting the DNA of the Pakistani state.

The amendment creates a new Federal Constitutional Court, potentially diluting the powers of the Supreme Court and creating ambiguity about the hierarchy of judicial authority.

President Zardari is also granted lifelong immunity in the amendment, mirroring the legal shield given to Munir.

This dual protection signals a strategic alliance between the military and top civilian figures to institutionalize mutual insulation from accountability.

“Too much has been left to ad hoc and arbitrary decisions,” Mazari warned.

The domestic question: Can repression deliver reform?

The three-front storm: Taliban, TTP, and India

“If you nurture snakes in your backyard, they will bite you,” said Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, the Pakistani military’s official spokesman, referencing the Taliban. What a comeuppance : The remark could just as well apply to all Pakistan-grown terror groups and the TTP, whose resurgence is a grim case of blowback.

The bottom line





In Pakistan, where generals have often ruled with impunity and influence, Field Marshal Asim Munir is scripting a new playbook-quiet, precise, and constitutionally sealed. His rise is not just another chapter in the country’s well-worn saga of military dominance. It is, as one senior opposition leader put it, “a rewrite of the entire power manual.”Pakistan’s controversial 27th Constitutional Amendment proposes to recast the country’s military command structure by abolishing the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC) and creating the role of Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) - a position that will be held by the Army Chief, currently Field Marshal Asim Munir •The amendment vests unprecedented legal and constitutional power in the CDF, giving Munir operational and institutional control over the army, navy, and air force, as well as the country’s nuclear command.•It also grants five-star officers life-long rank, privileges, and immunity, a move seen as creating a parallel unelected authority beyond the reach of civilian or judicial oversight.“This amendment appears tailored to benefit a specific individual rather than to strengthen the defence structure,” Lt Gen Asif Yasin Malik, former defence secretary, told Dawn.The CJCSC post - created after the 1971 war to ensure coordination among services - will be dissolved on November 27, 2025, when the current chairman, Gen Sahir Shamshad Mirza, retires.The 27th Amendment represents the largest shift in Pakistan’s civil-military balance since the Zia era, codifying the military’s supremacy in a way that future civilian governments may struggle to reverse.•The military will no longer merely influence governance from behind the scenes - it will be constitutionally entrenched at the center of executive authority.•Strategic nuclear assets, previously overseen by the National Command Authority, will now fall under the commander of national strategic command, appointed by the PM on the army chief’s advice, and selected from within the army.“All nuclear weapons and delivery systems will be under army control, including second-strike missiles traditionally under the Navy,” warned Dr Shireen Mazari, former human rights minister, a Dawn report said.•The change grants the army a monopoly over promotions, transfers, and postings across the services, threatening morale and inter-service harmony.“If promotions in the Air Force and Navy are determined by an army-origin CDF, it could lead to festering resentments,” Mazari cautioned.At home, Munir is both omnipresent and embattled. According to a Financial Times report, his supporters compare him to Mohammed bin Salman or South Korea’s General Park - ruthless modernisers willing to bulldoze institutions in the name of reform. His critics, however, see echoes of Zia-ul-Haq’s theocratic militarism cloaked in constitutional legitimacy.The judiciary is already split, thanks to a proposed constitutional court that would dilute the Supreme Court’s power. Journalists are censored, civil rights groups are muzzled, and political opponents - most notably former Prime Minister Imran Khan - are jailed or silenced.And yet, Munir has cast himself as the architect of reform. In his speech at the Pakistan Military Academy, he spoke of “treasures hidden beneath our land” and claimed that Pakistan had begun to “regain its rightful place in the comity of nations.”But the economy tells another story. As per the FT report, Pakistan’s investment rate is the lowest in South Asia, its poverty rate has risen to 25%, and its youth unemployment is dangerously high. The country remains dependent on IMF bailouts and Gulf financing that has yet to materialise in promised volumes.While Munir consolidates power at home, Pakistan finds itself encircled by a resurgent triangle of threats - each historically rooted, each dangerously revived. In the west, the Afghan Taliban’s return to power in 2021 has proved more liability than leverage. Once covertly supported by Pakistan’s security establishment, the Taliban now resist Islamabad’s demands and turn a blind eye to cross-border attacks on Pakistani soil.More ominously, the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), an offshoot long declared outlawed, has regrouped in Afghanistan and resumed attacks in Pakistan’s tribal belt and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. This year alone, militant violence has killed over 1,400 people - the highest toll in a decade.“The military simply lacks political support on the ground there,” Iftikhar Firdous, founder of The Khorasan Diary, told FT. “The crackdown has alienated entire communities.”Simultaneously, Pakistan’s eastern border with India remains fragile after the four-day air conflict in May.Add to that domestic insurgencies in Balochistan and the Pashtun belt, and Pakistan now faces not one, but three overlapping security fronts. Instead of acting as a force-multiplier, the military’s expanding political and economic footprint is beginning to stretch its operational capacity thin.The 27th Amendment enshrines military supremacy in Pakistan's Constitution under the guise of reform and modernization.•It moves the country further away from parliamentary democracy, and deeper into military-led constitutional authoritarianism.•As Field Marshal Asim Munir prepares to become the first Chief of Defence Forces, Pakistan’s most consequential question remains: Can a military man fix a failing nation - or will history repeat itself?(With inputs from agencies)","Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Powers Set To Grow As Shehbaz Govt Mulls 27th Constitution Amendment.

ISLAMABAD: A suicide bomber killed 12 people outside a court in Islamabad on Tuesday in a sharp escalation of militant violence that the defence minister said had pushed the country into a ""state of war"".Pakistani govt ministers accused neighbouring Afghanistan of complicity in the bloodshed - an accusation Kabul denied - and vowed retaliation if Afghan authorities failed to rein in the militants Islamabad says were responsible. ""We are in a state of war,"" said defence minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif after the attack, the first strike on civilians in Islamabad in a decade. ""Bringing this war to Islamabad is a message from Kabul, to which Pakistan has the full power to respond. ""The bombing outside an Islamabad court also wounded 27 people interior minister Mohsin Naqvi said. The court bomber blew himself up near the entrance at around lunchtime. Images on local media showed people covered in blood lying next to a police van. A vehicle was seen on fire and another car was badly damaged. Police cordoned off the site. Naqvi said the bomber had tried to enter the court building on foot but, unable to find a way in, detonated the device outside, close to a police vehicle.Several of the wounded were in critical condition, a hospital source said.No group claimed responsibility for Tuesday's attack. The main Pakistani militant group, Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), denied involvement in the attacks. But a group affiliated with the Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, according to The Khorasan Diary, a digital platform in Islamabad that monitors militant activity in the region.TTP militants have in recent years focused attacks on security forces. Civilians had not been hit in Islamabad for a decade, according to Armed Conflict Location and Event Data, a group that tracks attacks.Islamabad says that the Pakistani Taliban and other militants are based in Afghanistan, with the support of India. ""We are totally clear that Afghanistan has to stop them. In case of a failure, we have no option but to take care of those terrorists who are attacking our country,"" Naqvi said, speaking at the scene of the court bombing. The Taliban administration spokesperson in Kabul did not respond to a request for comment on Pakistan's accusations.The court attack happened hours after militants stormed a school near the Afghan border on Monday. The attack on the school in Wana, in the north west, began Monday, when a suicide vehicle rammed the main entrance, killing three people, Naqvi said. Militants then entered the school, which is run by the military but educates civilians.By Tuesday evening, three militants were still inside the compound, security officials said, with rescue operations under way for the students trapped in another part of the school. Naqvi said that the school assailants were in contact with their handlers in Afghanistan during the attack.Reuters","A suicide bomber killed 12 people outside a court in Islamabad on Tuesday in a sharp escalation of militant violence.

Surge in militant violence and worsening ties with Afghanistan







Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif said the country was “in a state of war” after a suicide bomber struck outside the Islamabad district courts on Tuesday, killing at least 12 people and injuring 27.The blast one of the deadliest to hit the capital in recent years has intensified tensions with Afghanistan, with Asif accusing the Taliban government in Kabul of allowing militants to operate freely.In a post on X, Asif said: “Anyone who thinks that the Pakistan army is fighting this war in the Afghan-Pakistan border region and the remote areas of Balochistan should take today’s suicide attack at the Islamabad district courts as a wake-up call: This is a war for all of Pakistan.”He wrote that Pakistan’s military was making “daily sacrifices while providing citizens with a sense of protection and security”, but warned that hoping for negotiations with Kabul would be a “mistake”. Asif insisted that Afghanistan “has the ability to prevent terrorist attacks inside Pakistan” and that bringing the conflict to the capital was “a message from Kabul”.He added that Pakistan “has the strength to respond fully”, saying the attack had erased any remaining doubts about the threat posed by militants operating from Afghan soil.The explosion took place around midday in Islamabad’s G-11 district, just outside the judicial complex where hundreds of lawyers and visitors were present. Police said the attacker tried to enter the court premises but failed, eventually detonating explosives next to a police vehicle, igniting cars and sending a fireball through the street.Interior minister Mohsin Naqvi confirmed that 12 people were killed and 27 wounded. He said authorities had recovered a severed head believed to be that of the attacker, and CCTV footage captured him moments before the blast. Witnesses described scenes of chaos, with people screaming for help as ambulances rushed to the site.The blast comes amid a sharp rise in militant violence across Pakistan. Security officials say the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) has carried out hundreds of attacks this year, mostly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa near the Afghan border, but strikes in major cities have been rare. Islamabad was last hit by a suicide attack three years ago.On Monday night, militants also attempted to storm an army-run college in Wana, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Security forces killed two attackers quickly, while others were cornered inside an administrative building. Students and staff were evacuated, and the military said the assault resembled the TTP’s 2014 massacre in Peshawar that killed 154 people.Pakistan says the Afghan Taliban have allowed TTP fighters to take refuge across the border. Afghanistan denies harbouring the group.

Deadlock Deepens: Afghanistan Calls Pakistan Irresponsible As Peace Talks Break Down Once Again





ISLAMABAD: Pakistan said on Sunday that it was committed to dialogue to resolve differences with the Afghan Taliban but demanded that Kabul must address concerns regarding the use of its territory by terrorists.Foreign Office (FO) spokesperson Tahir Andrabi issued a statement on different media queries regarding the third round of talks with the Afghan Taliban regime in Istanbul on November 6, which concluded a day later. Turkiye and Qatar mediated the parleys.The peace talks ended without any agreement to tackle the thorny issues of cross-border terrorism , the top officials had said on Saturday.""Pakistan remains committed to the resolution of bilateral differences through dialogue.However, Pakistan's core concern, i.e. terrorism emanating from Afghanistan, needs to be addressed first and foremost,"" the FO said in a statement.It also said that Pakistan's Armed Forces and its people were well determined to eliminate the menace of terrorism from its soil and take action against its supporters, abettors and financiers.In the long statement, the spokesperson said that for the past four years, since the Taliban regime came to power in Afghanistan, there has been a sharp surge in terrorist attacks emanating from Afghan soil.""Throughout these years, Pakistan, despite suffering military and civilian casualties, exercised maximum restraint and did not retaliate,"" it said.Pakistan's expectation was that the Taliban regime would be able to control these attacks and take concrete actions against the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan/Fitna al Khawarij (TTP/FaK) elements present on Afghan soil, the FO said.The Pakistan government last year notified the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) as ""Fitna al-Khawarij"", a reference to a group in earlier Islamic history which was involved in violence.Pakistan also tried to positively engage with Afghanistan by offering bilateral trade concessions and humanitarian assistance, and the intention to constructively engage with Afghanistan so as to enable it to become a stable, peaceful and prosperous country that is at peace within and with its neighbours, the statement said.However, despite all these positive gestures, ""the response from the Taliban regime has only been hollow promises and inaction,"" it added.Instead of acting upon the core expectation to stop Afghan territory from being used for attacks against Pakistan, the Taliban regime has always tried to shy away from taking concrete and verifiable actions, it said.""Instead, it has tried to confuse the main issue with other relatively irrelevant and hypothetical issues. By confusing the main issue of terrorism, it keeps trying to develop a narrative which absolves the Taliban regime of its commitments and responsibilities towards the international community and its own people,"" it added.The statement said that Pakistan's October 2025 response to the consistent attacks emanating from Afghanistan was a manifestation of the will and determination that it will not leave any stone unturned to safeguard its territory and its people.The statement added that the Taliban regime was only interested in prolonging the temporary ceasefire, but without taking concrete and verifiable actions against the TTP/FaK terrorists.Pakistan also accused the Afghan Taliban of using the issue of Pakistani terrorists hiding in Afghanistan as a humanitarian issue, adding that they had fled in 2015 to avoid a military operation and fought together with the Afghan Taliban against Nato troops.""These terrorists and their families are now being harboured by the Taliban regime as a payback for their allegiance to the Afghan Taliban,"" it said, and added that the same terrorists established training camps in Afghanistan to launch terrorist activities in Pakistan.The FO rejected the Kabul excuse of lack of control over TTP and demanded definite and concrete actions. Pakistan also rejected the portrayal of TTP as refugees and asked Kabul to hand them over to Pakistan.It said Pakistan has never eschewed dialogue with any Government in Kabul, but it would not hold dialogue with any terrorist group.",Pakistan says it is committed to dialogue to resolve differences with the Afghan Taliban.

Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Powers Set To Grow As Shehbaz Govt Mulls 27th Constitution Amendment

What does it mean?



Opposition backlash and protests



Divided legal opinions



Support for reforms







Pakistan’s government has introduced a major constitutional change that has sparked widespread debate and protests across the country. The proposed 27th constitutional amendment, which will be voted on in Parliament next week, seeks to restructure the military’s chain of command and overhaul the judiciary, prompting strong criticism from the Opposition.The current move mirrors the era of General Zia-ul-Haq, Pakistan’s longest-serving de facto head of state, who introduced sweeping constitutional changes to entrench military control under a civilian façade. The proposed 27th Amendment, risks reviving that legacy by placing the armed forces once again at the centre of Pakistan’s political structure.The bill, tabled in the Senate on Saturday after cabinet approval, proposes to abolish the post of chairman joint chiefs of staff committee (CJCSC) and replace it with a new and more powerful position -- chief of defence forces (CDF).According to reports in Dawn, the post will be held by the serving chief of army staff, who will also become the constitutional head of the army, navy and air force. This change would make General Asim Munir the most powerful military officer in Pakistan’s history, formalising his recent promotion to Field Marshal.The amendment also includes plans to set up a new federal constitutional court (FCC) and change how high court judges are appointed.It seeks to transfer some powers from the Supreme Court to the new court, while also granting the president lifelong immunity from criminal prosecution.Pakistan law minister Azam Nazir Tarar presented the bill in the senate, where chairman Yusuf Raza Gilani referred it to a committee led by Farooq Naek for review. Naek said the goal was to “create consensus among members” before the bill comes up for voting on Monday. The government is confident of securing a two-thirds majority in both the senate and the national assembly.Opposition parties have strongly opposed the amendment, calling it a direct threat to Pakistan’s Constitution. A coalition of opposition groups, the Tehreek-e-Tahafuz Ayeen-e-Pakistan (TTAP), which includes Imran Khan’s PTI, Majlis Wahdat-e-Muslimeen (MWM), Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP), Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) and the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) has announced nationwide protests starting Sunday.“Democratic institutions have been paralysed within Pakistan… the nation must step up against the [proposed] 27th Amendment,” MWM chief Allama Raja Nasir Abbas said.PkMAP leader Mahmood Khan Achakzai said the protests would begin with the slogan: “Long live democracy, down with dictatorship.” He warned, “The opposition alliance had no choice but to launch a protest movement following the government’s move, which is shaking the foundations of the Constitution.”Legal experts are split on the amendment’s impact. Critics say it would reduce the powers of the Supreme Court, making it “irrelevant,” and tighten executive control over the judiciary.One senior counsel told Dawn, “Left with a limited jurisdiction of deciding ordinary civil, criminal and statutory appeals, the Supreme Court has now become all the more a ‘Supreme District Court’.”Former additional attorney general Tariq Mehmood Khokhar warned that the changes would “empower [the new] Federal Constitutional Court by disempowering the Supreme Court.” He said the amendment also gives the Chief of the Defence Forces constitutional authority for life, formally recognising the Field Marshal rank.Another lawyer pointed out that under the new Article 175A, the chief justice of the FCC would outrank the chief justice of the Supreme Court of Pakistan and serve until the age of 68 -- three years longer than the current limit of 65.Some legal experts, however, have welcomed the changes. Senior counsel Hafiz Ahsaan Ahmad Khokhar called the 27th Amendment “a major and long-awaited structural shift” in Pakistan’s justice system.He said the plan to have two separate apex courts -- one for appeals (Supreme Court) and one for constitutional cases (FCC) -- would bring “greater clarity, efficiency and constitutional coherence.”He also argued that the reforms could reduce political influence in the judiciary, cut down case backlogs, and modernise the justice system.Khokhar added that the new defence structure under Article 243 was in line with “modern constitutional democracies,” ensuring that the armed forces would operate under a single advisory framework accountable to the prime minister, defence minister and National Security Committee.Newly elected Supreme Court Bar Association in Pakistan, President Haroonur Rasheed also supported the creation of a Federal Constitutional Court, saying it could help streamline the judicial process.","Proposed 27th constitutional amendment will be voted on in Parliament next week.

Pakistan on edge: Jaffar Express services suspended over security fears; thousands affected,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-on-edge-jaffar-express-services-suspended-over-security-fears-thousands-affected/articleshow/125199650.cms,"Over the past 12 months, the Jaffar Express has become a repeated target for insurgent groups (AI image)

Blast Hits Jaffar Express in Pakistan, Several Injured

A train under siege



The months that followed saw a stream of attacks:

In October, a blast on the Sindh section of the railway line derailed five bogies and injured several passengers.

In September, an explosion on the track in Mastung derailed six coaches, leaving 12 injured.

In August, six coaches derailed after an improvised explosive device went off in Mastung, while days earlier a pilot engine came under gunfire.

In July and June, two separate blasts in Sindh derailed multiple coaches.

Late last year, a suicide bomber at Quetta Station killed at least 26 people.

One battle after another

Pakistan Railways has halted all operations of the Jaffar Express between Quetta and Peshawar for four days beginning Sunday, citing “serious security concerns” in Balochistan, news agency PTI reported.The temporary suspension — enforced from 9 to 12 November — follows multiple insurgent attacks on the train over the past year, including a dramatic hijacking in March that left 26 people dead.Railway officials said the move came after fresh intelligence warnings of possible attacks targeting tracks, railway assets and civilian passengers. “The precautionary measure is based on advice from security and intelligence agencies to ensure the safety of passengers, railway staff, civilians and critical rail assets,” a senior official said, as quoted by PTI.The Jaffar Express is one of Pakistan’s busiest long-distance routes, carrying thousands of passengers daily at a cost far lower than road travel. Local commuters have criticised the shutdown, saying it leaves people in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with few affordable transport options.Over the past 12 months, the Jaffar Express has become a repeated target for insurgent groups, particularly the banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA).In March, BLA militants hijacked the train with 380 passengers on board, triggering a two-day standoff in a mountainous tunnel. Twenty-six people were killed before security forces rescued more than 350 passengers. Authorities said 33 militants also died in the rescue operation.Security officials say insurgent groups are increasingly targeting railways to cripple movement and signal the state’s inability to secure critical transport arteries. Analysts note that the frequency of attacks shows “a collapse of basic security control” across parts of Balochistan’s rail corridor.Political leaders in the province argue that Islamabad has ignored decades of local grievances. Balochistan National Party chief Akhtar Mengal recently warned that the state has “lost control” of the region, saying: “There is not a single inch of Balochistan left where the government can claim authority.”The suspension comes as Pakistan faces one of its most dangerous security challenges in years. Not only has the BLA intensified operations across Balochistan, but attacks linked to Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Islamic State Khorasan (ISK) and cross-border militants have surged.According to the latest Global Terrorism Index, Pakistan recorded a 45% jump in terrorism-related deaths this year. Security officials warn the country is now battling “four fronts at once”—an insurgent network straddling provincial, sectarian and cross-border lines.Diplomatic efforts have yielded little. Peace talks this week between Pakistan and Afghanistan in Istanbul collapsed without agreement, with both sides blaming each other for breakdowns in the ceasefire. Pakistan accuses Kabul of sheltering TTP fighters; the Taliban dismisses the allegations.","Pakistan Railways has halted all operations of the Jaffar Express between Quetta and Peshawar for four days beginning Sunday.

Pakistan’s government has moved ahead with one of the most sweeping structural changes to the country’s constitutional and military setup in decades. The proposed 27th Constitutional Amendment, tabled in the Senate on Saturday after approval by the federal cabinet, rewrites the chain of command of the armed forces and places Field Marshall Asim Munir higher than any military officer before him.The bill restructures Article 243 of the Constitution and creates a powerful new post: Chief of Defence Forces (CDF). According to Dawn, the position will be held by the serving Chief of Army Staff, who will simultaneously become the constitutionally recognised head of Pakistan’s Army, Navy and Air Force. The development formalises General Munir’s elevation as Pakistan’s Field Marshal — a title that the government has already awarded but is now seeking to permanently embed into the Constitution.The changes have ignited intense debate in Islamabad, dividing political parties, lawyers and civil society. Supporters argue that the bill modernises command structures, while critics see it as a dramatic centralisation of military power that weakens civilian oversight.As per report from Dawn, the bill abolishes the position of Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC), the top coordinating office among Pakistan’s military services, from 27 November, when the tenure of the current CJCSC General Sahir Shamshad Mirza ends.Law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar told Parliament that no new appointment will be made, because the Army Chief will take over the role’s functions as Chief of Defence Forces.Under the amendment, the President will appoint the Army, Naval and Air Chiefs on the Prime Minister’s advice, while the CDF will be constitutionally empowered to command all three services.A new position Commander of the National Strategic Command will oversee Pakistan’s nuclear and strategic arsenal. Dawn reported that the commander must be an officer from the Army, appointed by the Prime Minister on the recommendation of the CDF. This further cements the Army Chief’s control over nuclear command authority.The bill also grants unprecedented rights to officers who attain five-star ranks such as Field Marshal, Marshal of the Air Force, or Admiral of the Fleet.Law minister Tarar clarified that Parliament not the Pakistan Prime Minister will have the power to cancel such titles.The amendment does not stop at the military. The second half of the proposal restructures Pakistan’s judicial system.According to Geo News, the bill establishes a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC): a powerful new judicial body that would:Legal experts quoted by Dawn warned that the changes could “dethrone” the Supreme Court as Pakistan’s top judicial authority. One senior counsel said the Supreme Court risked being turned into a “Supreme District Court”, dealing mostly with ordinary appeals, while constitutional matters shift to the FCC.Former additional attorney general Tariq Mehmood Khokhar argued that the amendment tightens executive control over the judiciary and “empowers the FCC by disempowering the Supreme Court”.However, other senior lawyers called it a “forward-looking reform”. They say separating constitutional and appellate functions would reduce delays, depoliticise the Supreme Court and bring Pakistan closer to judicial models in other democracies.The bill has triggered fierce debate in Islamabad. The timing — months after Munir’s elevation and amid delicate coalition negotiations — has intensified public scrutiny.Dawn reported that the proposal surfaced after PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari revealed that PML-N leaders, including Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, requested PPP support for constitutional reforms.Government allies insist the reform merely formalises existing military structures and honours national heroes. Critics say it permanently rebalances power in favour of the Army.If adopted, the 27th Constitutional Amendment will be one of Pakistan’s most consequential defence reforms since the 1980s, dissolving one of the military’s oldest offices, raising the Army Chief to unprecedented constitutional supremacy, and reshaping Pakistan’s highest courts.","Pakistan's government has moved ahead with one of the most sweeping structural changes to the country’s constitutional and military setup in decades.

Donald Trump Stuns Shehbaz Sharif With India-Pak Peace Remark After Gaza Ceasefire Summit In Egypt





ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday once again thanked US President Donald Trump for resolving the India-Pakistan conflict in May.New Delhi has been consistently maintaining that India and Pakistan reached an understanding on May 10 to end the conflict after four days of intense cross-border drone and missile strikes, and no third party was involved in the process.""It was President Trump's bold and decisive leadership that brought about the ceasefire between Pakistan and India, restoring peace in South Asia, averting a major war, and saving millions of people,"" Sharif said while addressing Azerbaijan's Victory Day parade in Baku.Since May 10, when Trump announced on social media that India and Pakistan had agreed to a ""full and immediate ceasefire"" after a ""long night"" of talks mediated by Washington, he has repeated his claim several times that he ""helped settle"" the tensions between the two countries.India has consistently denied any third-party intervention.Pakistan has praised Trump on multiple occasions, claiming that he brokered a ceasefire during the May conflict.India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir in retaliation for the April 22 Pahalgam attack that killed 26 civilians.In his address, Sharif also mentioned Kashmir, saying that Azerbaijan's victory in Karabakh is a beacon of hope for all nations fighting against oppression.The Prime Minister said Pakistan seeks peace, but it will not allow anyone to challenge its sovereignty or undermine territorial integrity.The parade also included contingents of the armed forces from Pakistan and Turkiye who marched alongside Azerbaijani forces. The ceremony also included a splendid flypast of JF-17 Thunder jets.","Pakistan has praised Trump on multiple occasions, claiming that he brokered a ceasefire during the May conflict.

Deadlock Deepens: Afghanistan Calls Pakistan Irresponsible As Peace Talks Break Down Once Again

(With ANI inputs)





NEW DELHI: A day after peace talks between Afghanistan and Pakistan in Turkey broke down, the Taliban on Saturday accused “elements within the Pakistani military” of pursuing “anti-Afghanistan policies for years. ”“Unfortunately, certain military elements in Pakistan appear to view a stable and strong Afghanistan as contrary to their interests,” Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said in a statement on X. “They have long exploited Afghanistan’s instability, conflicts, and displacement, and now seem intent on creating tensions through fabricated pretexts.”Mujahid also rejected claims that the rise of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) was linked to the Taliban’s return to power in Kabul. “Some groups have falsely accused the Islamic Emirate, suggesting that instability in Pakistan and the TTP’s growth began with our arrival. In reality, both date back to 2002, a result of misguided policies by certain Pakistani military elements who aligned with the US, permitted drone strikes in Waziristan, and turned against their own people,” he wrote.He pointed to a series of Pakistani military campaigns against the TTP — including Operations Al-Mizan, Rah-e-Rast, Sher Dil, Nijat, Koh-e-Safid, and Zarb-e-Azb — that, he said, displaced hundreds of thousands of civilians.“In this so-called war on terror, 80,000–90,000 soldiers and civilians were killed, by Islamabad’s own count, long before the Islamic Emirate’s rise,” Mujahid added.Calling Pakistan’s instability “an internal issue,” Mujahid remarked the Taliban has taken steps to prevent cross-border militancy since taking power. These include mediating dialogue among political and religious figures, relocating refugees from the Durand Line, banning weapons among refugee populations, and issuing fatwas against unauthorized foreign jihad.“The Islamic Emirate welcomes all efforts that allow refugees to return safely,” he stated, reaffirming that Afghanistan would not allow its territory to be used to interfere in another country’s affairs.","The Taliban accused “elements within the Pakistani military’ of pursuing “anti- Afghanistan policies for years” “They have long exploited Afghanistan’s instability, conflicts, and displacement, and now seem intent on creating tensions through fabricated pretexts,” Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125186693,imgsize-78016,width-400,resizemode-4/taliban-accuses-pakistani-military-of-fueling-instability-through-quotmanufactured-pretextsquot.jpg"

Why Pakistani critics are skeptical?







Taking ""lessons"" from tensions with India, Pakistan has moved to fortify the constitutional basis of military command, signaling a push to modernize defense structures and tighten civilian-military coherence. Its law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, on Saturday, tabled the 27th Constitutional Amendment Bill in the upper house, a move aimed at revising Article 243 to formally enshrine the appointments and parallel ranks of the Army, Air, and Naval chiefs.Citing “lessons” from recent India-Pakistan standoffs, Tarar said the nature of modern warfare had changed, requiring constitutional alignment with evolving command realities.“Recent Pakistan-India tensions have taught us many lessons. The nature and strategy of war have completely changed. Appointment procedures and some positions were previously in the Army Act but were not mentioned in the 1973 Constitution. Parallel ranks exist worldwide for Air Chief and Naval Chief,” Tarar said.The move, however, has come under scanner as many believe it could give more power to military than the civilian government in Pakistan.India, on May 7, launched Operation Sindoor against terror sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, killing over 100 terrorists and targeting key JeM and LeT camps. The move, which came in retaliation to Pahalgam terror attack, turned into a major India-Pakistan issue with the latter also launching a military operation against India.By May 10, the two nations announced a ceasefire after Pakistan approached India for truce talks.Ten days after the truce, Pakistani army general Asim Munir was promoted to the rank of field marshal, the principal military advisor to the prime minister and the president of Pakistan on all matters related to national security. Before Munir, former Pakistan President Genral Ayub Khan had self elevated himself to field marshal in 1959.The proposed changes to Article 243 in Pakistan's Constitution, are designed to significantly bolster the authority of the military, specifically, army chief and recently designated field marshal Asim Munir. Here's how:According to an article by Pakistani media outlet Dawn, legal experts in Pakistan remain divided on whether such institutional adjustments truly warrant a constitutional amendment, noting that most operational reforms can be achieved through ordinary legislation rather than altering Article 243.Constitutional experts argued that modernising command structures or creating a Chief of Defence Staff-type position does not require amending Article 243. Such reforms could be introduced through ordinary legislation or defence rules. Altering the Constitution, they warned, risks expanding military autonomy under the guise of structural integration.Another confusion surrounding Article 243 stems from the changes introduced by the 26th Amendment, which extended the army chief’s tenure from three to five years. The current chief, appointed under the old law and later elevated to the ceremonial rank of field marshal, a position not mentioned in the Constitution, has become the focal point of legal ambiguity.Dawn reported that experts remain divided on whether his term automatically extends under the new law or requires a fresh notification, raising questions about the real intent behind the proposed 27th Amendment: to resolve this technical uncertainty or to further cement the military’s influence within Pakistan’s constitutional framework.","Pakistan's law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, on Saturday, tabled the 27th Constitutional Amendment Bill in the upper house.

Prices surge, tandoors punished

Trade paralysis and a deepening food crisis

Water shortage adds to worries – dams running dry





(With inputs from agencies)





Pakistan’s twin cities are staring at a worsening flour emergency after the Punjab food department halted wheat supplies to mills in Rawalpindi and Islamabad, triggering panic across markets and raising questions over the country’s fragile food security. The sudden suspension has deepened an already tense economic climate, with transport blockades, water shortages and declining dam levels all feeding fears of another nationwide crisis.Dealers say all existing orders for flour, wheat and fine flour were cancelled from Friday night, leaving shops and tandoor owners without stock, PTI reported citing the The Express Tribune.The Rawalpindi Flour Mills Association, which held an emergency meeting to address the crisis, warned that “production will remain paralysed” unless wheat permits are restored immediately. The association described the ban as “ill-considered” and cautioned that shortages could spiral into a humanitarian emergency in the federal capital and adjoining regions.Flour inflation has shot up at record pace, prompting anger from bakers and retailers. According to the Pakistan Naanbai Association, the price of a 79-kilogram sack of red flour has doubled to PKR 11,000 since the Shehbaz Sharif–Maryam Nawaz government took office.Fine flour, used widely for bread and bakery items, has risen from PKR 6,200 to PKR 12,600.The association’s president, Shafiq Qureshi, accused authorities of “state oppression”, claiming that dozens of tandoors have been demolished and nearly a hundred sealed for selling roti at higher prices in line with rising flour rates. Many owners have been fined between PKR 25,000 and PKR 50,000. “Instead of fixing the wheat supply, they are taking out their frustration on us,” Qureshi said, warning that families are being pushed to breaking point as bread becomes increasingly unaffordable.While wheat supply chokes Punjab’s food chain, Pakistan’s transport routes are already gridlocked due to deteriorating relations with Afghanistan.

‘Knew F-16s could deliver nukes’: Ex-CIA officer makes major claim on Pakistan; recalls warning of ‘enemy within’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/knew-f-16s-could-deliver-nukes-ex-cia-officer-makes-major-claim-on-pakistan-recalls-warning-of-enemy-within/articleshow/125181155.cms,"Representative image

CIA Whistleblower Confirms Pakistan’s F-16s Were Nuke-Capable, But US Hid The Truth From The World

‘Benazir was cut out of the loop’

A cover-up?





In a startling revelation, former CIA counterproliferation officer Richard Barlow has claimed that successive US Presidents continued to certify Pakistan as a non-nuclear state until 1989 — even though Washington’s own intelligence showed that US-supplied F-16 fighter jets had been modified to deliver nuclear weapons.Barlow, who tracked Pakistan’s clandestine nuclear program through the 1980s, said US officials were fully aware of Islamabad’s nuclear capabilities. “We knew that the F-16s were capable of delivering the Pakistani nuclear weapons as they existed at that time, without any doubt. It’s a hard engineering question, period. It had been looked at by the engineers and the physicists, not by me. There was that. Yet the government went ahead with the sale,” Barlow said in an interview with ANI.He added that the Reagan and Bush administrations kept certifying that Pakistan did not possess nuclear weapons “all the way through 1989,” even as CIA assessments contradicted those claims. “The President continued to certify that Pakistan did not possess nuclear weapons all the way through 1989. Now, I mean, I can tell you that most of us in the CIA are not comfortable with that, to say the least. But we’re not elected officials,” Barlow said.“All we can do is provide the elected officials and senior policymakers with the best available intelligence information, which is accurate, and brief them accordingly. What they do after that is not our place; we’re not in control of that.”Barlow said the US intelligence community had long concluded that Pakistan’s F-16 fleet could deliver nuclear weapons, a finding later echoed in journalist Seymour Hersh’s 1993 article in The New Yorker. “You can read all about it in Seymour Hersh’s article in The New Yorker in 1993. They saw the intelligence community saw nuclear weapons moving to air bases and being put on F-16s, et cetera. You know, so the nuclear weapons that Pakistan did not possess, according to the President of the United States, were actually being stuck on,” Barlow said.The revelations trace back to the 1987 “Brass Tacks” crisis, when Pakistani scientist Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan openly hinted at a nuclear deterrent amid heightened tensions with India. Barlow noted that the US technical experts had already verified Pakistan’s nuclear capability at that time.“To put it in a nutshell, there had been studies for years inside the intelligence community by experts, like national laboratories, etc. We knew all about the Pakistani nuclear weapons design, and we knew all about the F-16s, as you could imagine,” he said.According to Barlow, then Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto had limited control over Pakistan’s nuclear program, which was effectively managed by General Mirza Aslam Beg and President Ghulam Ishaq Khan. The US, he said, only confronted Islamabad over the issue after the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan in 1989.The US had kept the matter quiet during the Afghan war to secure Pakistan’s cooperation against the Soviet Union — a Cold War priority that overshadowed nuclear proliferation concerns.Additionally, talking about past India-Pakistan tensions, Barlow said that by 1990, tensions between India and Pakistan over the nuclear issue had reached alarming levels. The crisis was ultimately defused after then Defense Secretary Robert Gates was sent to New Delhi and Islamabad by President George HW Bush.He added that the 1990 standoff was “far more dangerous” than more recent India-Pakistan flare-ups due to poor command structures and limited communication. “There was a significantly greater chance of miscalculation in 1990 and miscommunication, among other issues. So I think that was a far more dangerous period,” he said.Barlow also discussed the Pressler Amendment, a 1985 US law requiring the President to certify annually that Pakistan did not possess a nuclear device to receive military aid.“After the 1990 nuclear crisis, my bosses at the agency refused to go along with any more certifications. Believe it or not, there were still people in the US government who wanted to certify under the Pressler Amendment,” he said. “They were having a collective heart attack because they knew it was over — the aid, et cetera.”Barlow also claimed that senior US State Department officials secretly tipped off Islamabad about an undercover American operation in the 1980s to arrest a retired Pakistani general involved in nuclear smuggling. The joint CIA–Customs sting had targeted Pakistani agent Arshad Parvez, who was attempting to purchase 25 metric tons of Maraging 350 steel — a key material for uranium enrichment — under the direction of Brigadier General Inam-ul-Haq. “He was supposed to show up in Pennsylvania... but Haq didn’t show up. And I learned that some people in the State Department had tipped off the Pakistani government to this arrest warrantBarlow said he was furious upon learning that officials within his own government had sabotaged the operation, describing his reaction as “ballistic.” The revelation, he said, pointed to how elements within Washington prioritized Pakistan’s cooperation in the Afghan war over enforcing non-proliferation laws. “These were people in my own government, the enemy within,” Barlow remarked, adding that such internal compromises weakened US efforts to curb Pakistan’s nuclear build-up during the 1980s.",Former CIA counterproliferation officer Richard Barlow has claimed that successive US Presidents continued to certify Pakistan as a non-nuclear state until 1989.

Muhammad Yunus Sets February 2026 Election Date For Bangladesh Along With Referendum On July Charter

What is July Charter?





Bangladesh's interim chief adviser Muhammad Yunus on Thursday announced that Dhaka will hold a national referendum on implementing the landmark “July Charter” for state reform on the same day as its parliamentary elections in February 2026.The charter, drafted following last year’s deadly student-led uprising, aims to reshape the country’s political institutions and enshrine constitutional recognition of the 2024 movement that led to the ouster of long-time Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Addressing the nation, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Yunus said, “The parliamentary elections will be held in a festive atmosphere in the first half of February. The referendum on the July Charter will be held on the same day as the parliamentary elections.”He emphasized that the elections would be free, fair and inclusive, urging political parties to ensure youth and women are represented in their manifestos and governance plans, news agency Reuters reported.The July Charter is a 26-point document outlining proposed reforms in governance, constitutional and political issues.It proposes significant reforms. These include stronger checks and balances between the executive, judicial and legislative branches, a two-term limit for prime ministers, expanded presidential powers and recognition of Bangladesh as a multi-ethnic and multi-religious nation.The declaration sharply criticized the 1972 Constitution after its independence war against Pakistan in 1971, calling for reforms aligned with the will of the people.""Whereas, the post-independence Awami League government failed to materialise the people's aspirations because of the weaknesses in the procedures of drafting and in the structure of the constitution, along with its inappropriate application,"" the charter read.It also condemned Sheikh Hasina’s administration, accusing it of turning Bangladesh into a fascist, mafia and failed state through alleged authoritarian rule and human rights violations.""Whereas, during the rule of Sheikh Hasina, under her very leadership, an extreme force that was anti-people, autocratic and against human rights turned Bangladesh into a fascist, mafia and failed state and thereby tarnished Bangladesh's international image,"" it added.The document calls for the 2024 uprising to be given official recognition and proposes that the July Charter be included in a reformed constitution.While most political parties endorsed the charter in October, the National Citizens Party (NCP) and four left-leaning groups boycotted it, citing the lack of a legal framework or binding guarantees for implementation.Supporters view the charter as foundational for institutional reform, while critics warn its impact could be largely symbolic without parliamentary consensus.The announcement comes amid heightened political tensions across Bangladesh.Last week, the country witnessed widespread protests, disruptions in schools and transportation and incidents of violence following Hasina’s trial on charges related to the 2024 uprising, which left hundreds dead.The former prime minister, who fled to India in August last year after a mass uprising, has called the tribunal a “kangaroo court” and denounced the interim government’s actions.In her interview, Hasina accused Yunus of backing Islamists and violating human and political rights. The Yunus-led administration has banned all activities of Hasina's party. She vowed to fight back, news agency AP reported.Security remains tight nationwide. Soldiers and law enforcement agencies were deployed to guard the special tribunal in Dhaka.The tribunal is handling Hasina’s case along with that of former home minister Asaduzzaman Khan and former police chief Chowdhury Abdullah Al-Mamun. Al-Mamun, who pleaded guilty and became a state witness, was present at the tribunal under tight security.Yunus, who took over as interim leader in August 2024 following Hasina’s ouster. He had described the political system he inherited as “completely broken down” and has championed the July Charter as essential to preventing a return to authoritarian rule.The charter, officially unveiled earlier this year, also criticizes the 1972 Constitution and Hasina’s administration for failing to uphold human rights and democratic governance.The interim government has banned activities of Hasina’s Awami League, effectively barring the party from future elections unless the ban is lifted.","Muhammad Yunus Sets February 2026 Election Date For Bangladesh Along With Referendum On July Charter.

Bangladesh Elections: Awami League, BNP Allege Lawlessness Under Yunus, Fear Violence In Polls





DHAKA: Islamists in Bangladesh rallied on Tuesday to demand the interim government legalise a national charter proposed after the ouster of the previous regime, saying that there is no possibility of holding a general election without a legally binding roadmap for political reforms.Thousands of supporters of the largest Islamist party Jamaat-e-Islami and seven other political parties who gathered in the capital, Dhaka, also demanded that the next election - expected to be held in early 2026 - be held under a proportional representation system.The key demand is for a referendum on the ""July National Charter"", which is named after the national uprising that began in July 2024 and led to the fall of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina following a 15-year rule that critics said had become increasingly autocratic.But the charter is currently non-binding, and the parties say a referendum is needed to make it legally binding and a part of the constitution. Only a Parliament can bring changes to the constitution in Bangladesh, a parliamentary democracy of 170 million people.The roadmap for political reform was proposed by the interim government headed by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus who took over three days after Hasina's ouster in a mass uprising on Aug 5 last year.Its provisions would include bringing more checks and balances to the country's political system to avoid authoritarian administrations, including by giving the presidency more authority to balance what had been a powerful prime minister position. It also proposes term limits for legislators, and measures to prevent conflicts of interest, money laundering and corruption.The Bangladesh Nationalist Party, headed by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, signed the charter on Oct 17 along with 24 other parties. The country has 52 registered political parties.Other than Zia's party, Hasina's Awami League party is another major party. Its activities have been banned by the Yunus-led government and Hasina is facing trial for the deaths of hundreds of people during last year's uprising.The Jamaat-e-Islami party, which has a dark history involving Bangladesh's independence war, has signed the charter and is forging a bigger political platform to contest in the next election in the absence of the Awami League.At Tuesday's rally, the supporters of Jamaat-e-Islami and other allied parties said that there would be no election unless the referendum is held and the charter is made binding.A special tribunal dealing with charges of crimes against humanity is scheduled to announce a date for verdict against Hasina on Thursday. The former prime minister, who has denounced the trial process as a ""kangaroo court"", has been in exile in India since her ouster. Bangladesh's politics has remained at a crossroads under Yunus.Human rights groups have accused the Yunus-led government of violating human and political rights of the opposition, especially of Hasina's supporters.Hasina's son told The Associated Press earlier that only an inclusive election could stabilise the country."," Islamists in Bangladesh rally to demand the interim government legalise a national charter.

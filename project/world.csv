'Walking corpses': Photos of malnourished Gaza toddler go viral as humanitarian situation worsens; see pics inside,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/walking-corpses-photos-of-malnourished-gaza-toddler-go-viral-as-humanitarian-situation-worsens-see-pics-inside/articleshow/122893326.cms,"Image used for representative purposes

People of Gaza describe their living conditions





A Gaza-based photographer has revealed the heartbreaking reality behind a viral image taken by him of a severely underweight child, captured amid the worsening humanitarian crisis in the territory.Speaking to BBC Newshour, Ahmed al-Arini said he took the photograph to ""show the rest of the world extreme hunger"" affecting babies and children in the Gaza Strip.While global food security experts have not formally declared a famine, United Nations agencies have warned that Gaza is in the grip of mass, man-made starvation. They cite Israel’s control over the flow of supplies into the Palestinian enclave as the primary cause- a claim Israel strongly denies. The Israeli government instead blames Hamas for malnutrition cases.According to the UN’s Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA), around 20 per cent of children in Gaza City suffer from malnutrition, with the numbers growing daily. On Thursday, UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini relayed a stark observation from a colleague, similar to the photographer's portrayal, - ""People in Gaza are neither dead nor alive, they are walking corpses.""Over 100 international humanitarian and human rights organisations have sounded the alarm on widespread hunger and urged immediate global intervention.Israel, which oversees all crossings into Gaza, maintains it is not imposing a blockade and continues to hold Hamas accountable for food shortages. The UN, however, says the level of aid entering the strip is critically low and the hunger crisis is without precedent.In a statement, Lazzarini said ""more than 100 people, the vast majority of them children, have reportedly died of hunger."" He added: ""Most children our teams are seeing are emaciated, weak and at high risk of dying if they don't get the treatment they urgently need."" He urged Israel to ""allow humanitarian partners to bring unrestricted and uninterrupted humanitarian assistance to Gaza.""UNRWA staff themselves are increasingly struggling. ""When caretakers cannot find enough to eat, the entire humanitarian system is collapsing,"" Lazzarini said, adding that staff are ""increasingly fainting from hunger while at work.""The World Health Organisation (WHO) echoed the warnings. On Wednesday, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, ""I don't know what you would call it other than mass starvation — and it's man-made.""In northern Gaza, 40-year-old Hanaa Almadhoun described worsening conditions. She told the BBC via WhatsApp, ""If [food and supplies] do exist then they come at exorbitant prices that no ordinary person can afford."" She explained that people had sold ""gold and personal belongings"" just to buy flour.""Every new day brings a new challenge"" as families scavenge for ""something edible,"" she added. ""With my own eyes, I've seen children rummaging through the garbage in search of food scraps.""During a visit to Israeli forces in Gaza on Wednesday, Israeli President Isaac Herzog insisted that his country was providing humanitarian aid ""according to international law."" But aid worker Tahani Shehada, based in Gaza, described a different reality saying, ""People are just trying to survive hour-by-hour. Even simple things like cooking [and] taking a shower have become luxuries."" She added: ""I have a baby. He's eight months old. He doesn't know what fresh fruit tastes like.""In early March, Israel suspended aid deliveries to Gaza following a temporary ceasefire. Though some restrictions were later eased, shortages of food, fuel, and medicine have only deepened.To streamline relief efforts, Israel and the United States established the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), but deadly incidents have continued. The UN human rights office reports that over 1,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces while attempting to collect food aid in the last two months, according to BBC.At least 766 of those deaths occurred near one of GHF’s four distribution centres, operated by US private contractors inside Israeli military zones. Another 288 were killed near UN and other aid convoys.Israel maintains that Hamas incites disorder near aid convoys and insists that its troops fire only warning shots, avoiding civilian harm. The GHF has accused the UN of relying on ""false"" data from Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry.Najah, a 19-year-old widow sheltering at a Gaza hospital, said she fears for her life every time she attempts to reach an aid site. She told the BBC: ""I hope they bring us something to eat and drink. We die of hunger with nothing to eat or drink. We live in tents. We are finished off.""Dr Aseel, a physician working with a UK-based medical charity in Gaza, disputed the suggestion that famine is looming — saying it’s already here. ""My husband went once [to an aid distribution point] and twice and then got shot and that was it,"" she said. ""If we are to die from hunger, let it be. The path to aid is the path to death.""Gaza market seller Abu Alaa described his family's daily struggle: ""We go to bed hungry every night. We are not alive. We are dead. We are pleading with the whole world to intervene and save us.""Meanwhile, Eight months pregnant with her third child, Walaa Fathi said Gaza is experiencing a level of deprivation few imagined possible. From Deir al-Balah, she told the BBC: ""We are experiencing a catastrophe and a famine that no one could have imagined. I hope that my baby stays in my womb and I don't have to give birth in these difficult circumstances.""","Gaza-based photographer Ahmed al-Arini has revealed the heartbreaking reality behind a viral image taken by him of a severely underweight child.

'Epstein scam': Trump blames 'Democrats con job' for distraction from 'great six months of service'; hopes grand jury files will 'put an end to this',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/epstein-scam-trump-blames-democrats-con-job-for-distraction-from-great-six-months-of-service-hopes-grand-jury-files-will-put-an-end-to-this/articleshow/122892805.cms,"



US President Donald Trump on Thursday (local time) hit out at what he called a “Democrat con job”, after reports claimed that his name appears multiple times in files linked to the child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.In a statement posted on social media, Trump claimed the Democratic Party was using the Epstein case as a political weapon, to distract from what the GOP achieved in the past 6 months of his tenure.“The Radical Left Democrats are doing everything in their power to distract and obfuscate from our GREAT six months of service to America, results of which many are saying is the BEST six months in Presidential history,” the US president wrote on Truth Social.“They have gone absolutely CRAZY, and are playing another Russia, Russia, Russia Hoax but, this time, under the guise of what we will call the Jeffrey Epstein SCAM,” he added.Trump insisted that the public would soon see the truth, pinning hopes on the release of court materials. “As things are revealed and, I hope will take place quickly, you will see that it is yet another Democrat CON JOB. Hopefully, the Grand Jury Files will put an end to this HOAX.”He said that everyone should witness what is in the files but no one innocent should be hurt.“Everyone should see what is there, but people who are innocent should not be hurt. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”The remarks come days after a Wall Street Journal report claimed that Attorney General Pam Bondi had informed Trump earlier this year that his name had been referenced repeatedly in the unsealed Epstein documents.Justice department officials have said the files do not amount to grounds for further investigation or prosecution. Nonetheless, the documents have stirred unease across party lines, with Democratic leaders now calling for full transparency.Tensions surrounding Donald Trump’s links to Jeffrey Epstein have deepened, following the emergence of previously unseen photos and videos that shed fresh light on the US President’s relationship with the convicted sex offender.The newly surfaced footage, reported by CNN, shows Trump laughing, conversing, and attending key events with Epstein, including the disgraced financier’s 1993 wedding at New York’s Plaza Hotel.Trump has long accused the Democrats of fabricating the 2016 election controversy, dismissing allegations that Russian interference played a role in his victory.Earlier, in a post on Truth Social, the president said that Barack Obama, along with Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, and others, orchestrated what he described as “the crime of the century,” alleging they falsely promoted the idea that Russian meddling helped him win the presidency.Trump insisted there is “clear proof” against the group, maintaining his position that the controversy was politically motivated and entirely manufactured.","US President Donald Trump hit out at what he called a “Democrat con job”, after reports claimed that his name appears multiple times in files linked to the child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

‘Make America Grime Again’: Trump sculpture emerges from New York sewer; White House reacts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/make-america-grime-again-trump-sculpture-emerges-from-new-york-sewer-white-house-reacts/articleshow/122892903.cms,"(Photo: jamescolomina/Instagram)





New Yorkers were greeted with an unexpected sight on Wednesday when a bright red sculpture of US President Donald Trump rising from a manhole was seen in Manhattan.The life-size statue was titled Donald and was installed by French street artist James Colomina at the corner of East 42nd Street and 2nd Avenue.The figure wore a suit and tie, showing Trump from the waist up as he appeared to rise out of a manhole. A small red rat peeked out from under the cover.""I installed the sculpture in New York because this is where he built his image, his empire, his legend,"" Colomina was quoted as saying to USA Today. ""A city he tried to conquer with golden towers and brutal slogans. I wanted this image – a red body rising from the sewers – to disturb that landscape.""The statue was placed roughly a mile from Trump Tower. However, it was quickly removed by a maintenance worker.Colomina said the entire sculpture was made in France over three weeks. He transported it to New York in parts and reassembled it on site early that morning. A photo of the installation was shared on his Instagram story with the caption “Make America Grime Again,” a play on Trump’s well-known MAGA slogan.The artwork created a stark visual contrast with its surroundings, particularly with the tall Chrysler Building behind it.“The sculpture is installed right across from the Chrysler Building, a symbol of power, elevation, and architectural pride,” Colomina said. “I liked the idea of creating a stark contrast between this vertical monument and the grotesque figure emerging from the sewers.”The White House responded with a dismissive tone. Spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told USA Today, “Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. This 'artist' will have to go back to the drawing board. Or perhaps art school.”Colomina is known for his bold, scarlet-red statues placed in public spaces around the world, including Paris, Tokyo, and Barcelona. His work often touches on urgent social and political themes.According to his biography on the Galeries Bartoux website, “The ‘Colomina Red,’ the artist’s visual signature, embodies the anger, passion, and urgency of the issues he tackles.”“James Colomina favors a clandestine, spontaneous approach: He places his works directly in the street, without prior announcement, transforming everyday spaces into platforms for artistic reflection,” the biography says.",Sculpture of US President Donald Trump rising from a manhole was seen in Manhattan.

'Reckless decision': US hits out at France’s push to recognise Palestinian state; claims it serves Hamas propaganda,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/reckless-decision-us-hits-out-at-frances-push-to-recognise-palestinian-state-claims-it-serves-hamas-propaganda/articleshow/122892678.cms,"US' Marco Rubio and France's Emmanuel Macron

Netanyahu calls Macron’s decision 'grave mistake'



Ceasefire talks







The United States on Thursday strongly opposed France’s decision to recognise a Palestinian state at the United Nations general assembly in September.US secretary of state Marco Rubio disapproved of France’s decision, calling it ‘Hamas propaganda’ and a setback to peace efforts in the Middle East.Rubio posted on X, “The United States strongly rejects Emmanuel Macron’s plan to recognize a Palestinian state at the UN general assembly. This reckless decision only serves Hamas propaganda and sets back peace. It is a slap in the face to the victims of October 7th.”French President Emmanuel Macron had earlier announced the decision to formally recognise Palestine during the September UN session.Macron took to X to announce the decision: “True to its historic commitment to a just and lasting peace in the Middle East, I have decided that France will recognise the State of Palestine.”France has long supported a two-state solution but has stopped short of formal recognition until now. Macron confirmed that France backs a Palestinian state without Hamas, and also reaffirmed support for Israel’s right to peace and security.Macron said he hoped the move would help generate a “collective dynamic” that would encourage Arab states to also recognise Israel. His announcement follows similar recognition from Ireland, Spain, Norway and Slovenia.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Macron’s decision “a grave mistake”. He criticised the French president for allegedly ignoring the threat posed by Hamas and other armed groups. “Israel will not accept moral lectures about statehood from countries that reject independence in their own territories,” Netanyahu said.France’s announcement comes amid the collapse of Gaza ceasefire talks in Doha. The United States, alongside Israel, withdrew from negotiations this week after failing to make progress. US special envoy Steve Witkoff accused Hamas of not “acting in good faith” and said, “Washington would now consider alternative options”.He added, “Hamas's response clearly shows a lack of desire to reach a ceasefire in Gaza.” Witkoff confirmed the US team was returning home and said other routes would be explored to bring hostages back and stabilise Gaza.The ceasefire talks, facilitated by Qatar, were aimed at halting the ongoing conflict and securing the release of Israeli hostages. But Hamas’s latest proposal, which included changes to aid delivery routes, military withdrawal zones and conditions for a permanent ceasefire, was not accepted by Israel. Netanyahu blamed Hamas for the deadlock and warned against misinterpreting Israel’s desire for a deal as weakness.“We are working to reach another deal for the release of our hostages,” he said. “But if Hamas interprets our willingness to reach a deal as a weakness, as an opportunity to dictate surrender terms that would endanger the State of Israel, it is gravely mistaken.”International concern continues to grow over Gaza’s worsening humanitarian crisis. The world health organization has warned of “man-made” famine conditions, with over two million Palestinians facing food and aid shortages. France blamed Israel’s blockade for the crisis, a claim that Israel rejected, accusing Hamas of obstructing aid distribution.Relief groups say they face huge challenges due to limited Israeli permissions and ongoing fighting. Meanwhile, voices on the ground are urging an end to the bloodshed.More than 140 countries already recognise Palestine, and France’s recognition would mark one of the most high-profile endorsements yet.The war in Gaza was triggered by Hamas’s October 7 attack on Israel that killed 1,219 people. It has continued for 21 months. According to Gaza’s health ministry, 59,587 Palestinians, mostly civilians, have died in Israeli strikes.","US secretary of state Marco Rubio disapproved of France’s decision, calling it ‘Hamas propaganda’ and a setback to peace efforts in the Middle East.

"New warning for green card holders in US: Always carry THIS at all times with you, CBP reminds",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/new-warning-for-green-card-holders-in-us-always-carry-this-at-all-times-with-you-cbp-reminds/articleshow/122866588.cms,"CBP issued a reminder to Green Card holders asking them to always carry the document with them.

What are Alien Registration Documents ?

Alien Registration Number (A-Number)

This is a unique 7–9 digit number assigned to non-citizens by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). This is used to track immigration records, applications, and status. This commonly starts with an “A”.

Green Card

Officially known as Form I-551, this is issued to lawful permanent residents. The Donald Trump administration has broken the conception that Green Card holders can't be arrested and their citizenship can't be revoked. A Green Card includes a photo, the A-number, category of admission and expiry date. This is proof of the right to live and work in the US permanently.

Employment Authorization Document



Arrival-departure record







The Customs and Border Police issued an important reminder the all green card holders that they have to carry at all times with them the proof of their alien registration as mandated by the law. ""Failing to do so can lead to a misdemeanor and fines if you are stopped by federal law enforcement,"" the reminder issued Wednesday said.This is not a new law and non-citizens are required to carry proof of their legal status in the US always but the Trump administration's reminder shows that the crackdown on green card holders, lawful permanent residents, will continue and just because they are legally residing in the country, it does not mean they will not be punished. The State Department earlier made it clear that permanent residents can also be deported if they are found flouting laws.Form I-7666 is also known as a work permit which is issued to non-citizens who are temporarily authorized to work. This contains the A number, photo and validity dates.I-94 documents a non-citizen's entry and authorized stay. This document includes the A-number for certain visa holders. This is issued at ports of entry or online for air travelers.Under US immigration law, most non-citizens over age 14 who stay in the U.S. for more than 30 days must carry their alien registration documentation at all times.","CBP issued a reminder to Green Card holders asking them to always carry the document with them.

"Media merger: CBS owner Paramount to enter $8.4B deal with Skydance, after lawsuit settlement with Trump; new owners commit $20 mn to pro MAGA ads",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/media-merger-cbs-owner-paramount-to-enter-8-4b-deal-with-skydance-after-lawsuit-settlement-with-trump-new-owners-commit-20-mn-to-pro-maga-ads/articleshow/122892106.cms,"The US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has officially approved the $8.4 billion merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media, clearing the final regulatory hurdle for a deal that had faced months of political and legal wrangling.The merger will hand over control of some of the biggest names in entertainment, CBS, Paramount Pictures, the Paramount+ streaming service, and cable networks like MTV, Nickelodeon, and Comedy Central, to independent studio Skydance, backed by billionaire David Ellison and investment firm RedBird Capital.“We’re going to celebrate now,” a source close to Skydance told The New York Post. “We’re all beat up. Just exhuasted, but it was well worth it. The next step is to close the deal early by Aug 7.”The FCC’s decision, passed by a 2-1 vote, came just weeks after Paramount paid $16 million to settle a lawsuit filed by Donald Trump over a 2020 “60 Minutes” interview with then-vice president Kamala Harris, which the president claimed was deceptively edited to sway the 2024 election. While CBS denied the allegation, it chose to settle to avoid any delays to the merger.Crucial to gaining FCC approval were assurances from Ellison, son of Oracle founder Larry Ellison, and RedBird Capital that the new management would ensure unbiased journalism at CBS. The company has promised to appoint an independent ombudsman to oversee complaints related to editorial fairness and transparency, the New York Post reported.In a move seen as politically charged, Paramount also scrapped its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives to align with the Trump administration’s stance, which argues such policies amount to discrimination.“Americans no longer trust the legacy national news media to report fully, accurately, and fairly,” said FCC Chair Brendan Carr, a Trump appointee.""It is time for a change. That is why I welcome Skydance’s commitment to make significant changes at the once storied CBS broadcast network.""Dissenting FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez, the sole Democratic vote against the deal, condemned the decision, saying, “After months of cowardly capitulation to this administration, Paramount finally got what it wanted.”As part of the deal, Shari Redstone, the controlling shareholder of Paramount Global, will receive $1.75 billion in cash and step down from the company’s board. Her departure marks the end of the Redstone family’s direct influence over the media empire her father, Sumner Redstone, built.Skydance, known for producing hits like Top Gun: Maverick and Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning, will merge with Paramount to form “Paramount Skydance Corp.” The newly formed company will remain publicly traded but under the control of the Ellison family. David Ellison will serve as chairman and CEO, while former NBCUniversal boss Jeff Shell will become president.The FCC also approved the transfer of 28 CBS-owned TV station licences to the new company. This came shortly after CBS abruptly cancelled The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, citing financial reasons. The programme, despite strong ratings, was reportedly losing $40 million a year.Trump, who originally sued Paramount for $20 billion, claimed this week that the real settlement was closer to $36 million. The new owners committed $20 million to run pro-MAGA public service ads.The merger marks a dramatic turning point for Paramount, which has struggled in recent years with declining revenues and the challenges of streaming-era disruption. Redstone had initially reunited CBS and Viacom in 2019 in a bid to strengthen the company’s competitive footing, but the rapidly changing media landscape proved difficult to navigate.With the deal now approved, all eyes will be on Ellison and Skydance as they take the reins of one of America’s most iconic media brands.","The US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has officially approved the $8.4 billion merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media.

What does this mean?



International grads will suffer, senior American employees will face competition







The US administration is planning to bring in a new H-1B rule which will give weightage to wage level instead of the random lottery that takes place now when H-1B registration exceed the annual limit of 65,000 plus the additional 20,000 for individuals with an advanced degree from a US university. The new rule will not be applicable this year as 2026's registration quota has already been reached. US tech workers have welcomed the proposed changes as they think the changes will eliminate the possibility of U companies hiring foreign workers for posts that don't need high skills, as H-1B should be -- but they hire only to save money as they will have to pay less wage to a foreigner than a US citizen.This is the same rule that the Trump administration wanted to bring in during the last term. “USCIS will rank and select the petitions received on the basis of the highest Occupational Employment Statistics wage level that the proffered wage equals or exceeds for the relevant Standard Occupational Classification code in the area of intended employment, beginning with OES wage level IV and proceeding in descending order with OES wage levels III, II, and I. ” (The Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics program is within the Department of Labor.)""the 2021 DHS rule said.This means there will be no H-1B hiring at the entry level. Entry-level jobs will be protected for Americans.Based on the wages and expertise needed for a job, there are four levels: Entry, qualified, experienced and fully competent.The national average of entry-level salary is $83K, level 2 is $108K, level 3 is $127K and level 4 is $151K.International graduates looking for entry-level jobs in America will suffer as they will not get a chance in the proposed system. While this is good news for American graduates, the new rule has bad news for senior American leadership as the new system will bring in more high-paid mid-level H-1Bs.

The White House's first reaction to Wednesday night's South Park premiere attacking President Donald Trump is here.

This show hasn't been relevant for over 20 years and is hanging on by a thread with uninspired ideas in a desperate attempt for attention.

Democrat congressman Greg Casar introduces bill to ban AI-driven price; slams ‘surveillance pricing’; seeks Republican support,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/democrat-congressman-greg-casar-introduces-bill-to-ban-ai-driven-price-slams-surveillance-pricing-seeks-republican-support/articleshow/122866540.cms,"Representational image





US congressman Greg Casar has introduced a new bill to stop what he calls “AI-driven price gouging”. The bill, called the Stop AI Price Gouging and Wage Fixing Act of 2025, targets companies that use personal data to charge customers different prices for the same product, a growing trend known as surveillance pricing.Casar, a Democrat from Texas, says tech companies are going too far by spying on people’s habits and financial history. “Prices should be based on supply and demand and based on how much it costs to make and sell a thing, not based on spying on you and using your private data,"" he told NBC News.The move follows a recent federal trade commission ( FTC ) report that found companies were using users' browser history, GPS location and shopping behaviour to silently adjust prices. The practice is common in e-commerce, and often powered by artificial intelligence.The FTC study, released in January just before president Biden left office, revealed that big firms like Mastercard, JPMorgan Chase, Accenture and McKinsey were among those feeding AI systems with consumer data. FTC chair Lina Khan called the system a “black box” where users don’t even realise they’re being charged more based on hidden profiling.Casar’s bill would also prohibit companies from using AI to determine wages based on personal financial data rather than job performance.Several US states are also cracking down. New York passed a law requiring businesses to inform customers when prices are set using algorithms. California may soon follow. But Casar’s bill is the first push for a national ban.The House is about to go into recess, so the bill won’t move before September. But Casar hopes both parties can get behind it. “You don’t have to be a progressive Democrat to say these gigantic corporations in the tech world should not be spying on us and then using what they learn to put it into AI and make our life more expensive,” he said.","US congressman Greg Casar has introduced a new bill to stop what he calls ‘AI- driven price gouging’ The bill, called the Stop AI Price Gouging and Wage Fixing Act of 2025, targets companies that use personal data to charge customers different prices for the same product.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122866910,imgsize-64540,width-400,resizemode-4/122866910.jpg"

The woman who rescued an Indian man after a brutal mob attack in Dublin has now shared fresh details on Facebook video, saying he was falsely accused of being a paedophile, stabbed in the face, stripped naked, and left bleeding on the road for over an hour before help arrived.Jennifer Murray, a resident in Tallaght, said she was driving past a roundabout on Saturday evening when she saw a crowd of nearly 30 people, including teenagers and some adults, standing around. Murray said she stopped her car when she noticed a man standing alone, covered in blood.She said he was bleeding from head to toe. His nose was pouring blood. He told her, ‘Please help me, please save me,’” she recalled. She said took him to her car and waited more than an hour for an ambulance. Gardaí, the state police force of the Republic of Ireland, confirmed they received a call around 6pm and that the man was later taken to Tallaght University Hospital.The man, believed to be in his 40s, had come to Ireland three weeks earlier for a job at Amazon. He was on his way to a temple when a group of around 10 teenagers attacked him from behind with a knife, shouting claims that he was a paedophile. According to Murray, they punched and kicked him, slashed his face, and robbed him of his phone, wallet, shoes, and trousers, leaving him naked in public.Murray says the man was traumatised and too ashamed to speak clearly. ""He was so extremely polite to me the whole time. I gave him a blanket to cover himself up. He was so embarrassed and shocked,"" she said. Later, she visited the home where he was staying and informed the Indian family who took him in. “They jumped into action. His housemate’s wife told me she had warned him that Ireland was not safe.”She also said the he was highly qualified, having studied at one of India’s top colleges, and was hired for a role that required specialised skills not readily available in the local workforce.Murray also claimed that four other Indian men and one more individual had been facially stabbed by the same gang over the past few days.","Jennifer Murray, a resident in Tallaght, said she was driving past a roundabout on Saturday evening when she saw a crowd of nearly 30 people, including teenagers and some adults, standing around.

"Epstein case: 'Ex-girlfriend' Ghislaine Maxwell interviewd by DOJ deputy; 'answered all the questions truthfully, honestly, says her lawyer",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/epstein-case-ex-girlfriend-ghislaine-maxwell-interviewd-by-doj-deputy-answered-all-the-questions-truthfully-honestly-says-her-lawyer/articleshow/122892188.cms,"



US deputy attorney general Todd Blanche held a meeting with convicted sex offender Ghislaine Maxwell and her lawyer in Tallahassee, as pressure mounts on the justice department to disclose more about its handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case.The meeting lasted several hours, with Blanche posing extensive questions and Maxwell responding to each of them, according to her lawyer David Oscar Markus.“Productive day today with the Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche and Ghislaine Maxwell,” he said, as quoted by CNN.“She never invoked a privilege. She never declined to answer. She answered all the questions truthfully, honestly and to the best of her ability,” Markus added, though he declined to reveal the content of the conversation.Blanche later confirmed he would return tomorrow to continue the interview. “The Department of Justice will share additional information about what we learned at the appropriate time,” he posted on X.The meeting comes just weeks before Maxwell is due to testify before the US Congress under subpoena. The House Oversight Committee has ordered her to appear on 11 August, calling her testimony “crucial” to understanding the federal government’s failings in the Epstein case, including controversial plea deals and prosecution gaps.Maxwell, a British socialite and former girlfriend of Epstein, is serving a 20-year sentence after being convicted in 2022 for grooming and trafficking underage girls in partnership with the disgraced financier. She has since filed an appeal.Blanche had earlier acknowledged that Maxwell was never before approached by federal investigators willing to hear her out.“That changes now,” he said, signalling a shift in the justice department’s posture under President Donald Trump’s directive to release all “credible evidence” related to Epstein’s crimes.Her lawyer also said that past prosecutors had avoided direct talks and welcomed the administration’s new approach.“The truth should not be feared or ignored,” Markus said. “We’re grateful someone is finally listening.”Maxwell’s possible testimony before Congress could mark a turning point in the saga, depending on whether she decides to fully cooperate. “She’s taking this one step at a time,” Markus said. “If she chooses to testify before Congress, and not plead the Fifth, she will speak the truth—as she always said she would,” he addedThe renewed attention to Maxwell’s case comes amid mounting scrutiny over the handling of Epstein-related investigations and growing calls for transparency. A federal judge in Florida last week refused to unseal grand jury records from the early 2000s, rejecting a request by the Trump administration to make them public.Meanwhile, political tensions continue to rise following a Wall Street Journal report highlighting past links between Trump and Epstein. The US president filed a defamation lawsuit against Rupert Murdoch and the newspaper.","Deputy attorney general Todd Blanche held a meeting with convicted sex offender Ghislaine Maxwell and her lawyer in Tallahassee.

"Idaho student murders: Loose door hinges, man lurking in the shadows – series of creepy incidents that preceded the killings",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/idaho-student-murders-loose-door-hinges-man-lurking-in-the-shadows-series-of-creepy-incidents-that-preceded-the-killings/articleshow/122891919.cms,"



Chilling new details have emerged from police files revealing that the University of Idaho students murdered by Bryan Kohberger experienced unsettling incidents in the days leading up to their deaths.According to documents released by authorities on late Wednesday, the victims, Xana Kernodle, Kaylee Goncalves, Madison Mogen and Ethan Chapin, returned to their off-campus home in Moscow, Idaho, on 4 November 2022 to find their front door wide open and loose on its hinges. The wind was blowing it open, and the damage was so concerning that Kernodle’s father was called in to fix it, the New York Post reported.This wasn’t the only troubling event before the brutal stabbings on 13 November. One of the surviving roommates, Bethany Funke, told investigators that Goncalves had been alarmed weeks earlier after spotting a strange man watching her while she was outside walking her dog. Goncalves was so disturbed by the encounter, which occurred near the back of the house, that she had called her roommates to ask when they’d be home.It remains unclear whether the man she saw was Kohberger or if the earlier events were directly connected to the murders.The files also provide harrowing details about the attack itself. Kernodle is said to have suffered over 50 stab wounds, including two to her heart. She was found lying on her back in a blood-soaked shirt and underwear, with multiple defensive wounds on her hands, including a deep gash between her fingers, signs she fought hard against her killer.Kohberger, 30, pleaded guilty to the murders as part of a deal to avoid the death penalty and was sentenced to four consecutive life terms. He did not speak in court to explain his motive or offer any apology for the crimes.“I share the desire expressed by others to understand the why,” said Judge Steven Hippler during sentencing. “But upon reflection, it seems to me, and this is just my own opinion, that by continuing to focus on why, we continue to give Mr Kohberger relevance, we give him agency and we give him power.”","Xana Kernodle, Kaylee Goncalves, Madison Mogen and Ethan Chapin were found dead in their off-campus home in Moscow, Idaho, on 13 November 2022.

An NYPD officer has been suspended without pay after reportedly falling asleep while guarding a suspect who escaped from a New York hospital earlier this week.The man, 36-year-old Stephen Blasetti, had been under watch at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. He was earlier arrested and charged with grand larceny after allegedly stealing two boats while completely naked from a marina on Manhattan’s Dyckman Street.According to police, Blasetti managed to leave the hospital around 6.30 am on Wednesday after changing into a white lab coat and blue hospital trousers, but no shoes. He has not been found since.The NYPD confirmed that the officer assigned to monitor him has been suspended as the department reviews the incident, reported New York Post.Blasetti made headlines after allegedly stripping and jumping into a small sailboat on Saturday afternoon. When officers from the NYPD Harbor Patrol tried to stop him, he reportedly swam to a larger catamaran in the river. He was arrested there and taken to hospital for a mental health check.Police believe he may have been under the influence of methamphetamines during the incident. He is still on the run.","Stephen Blasetti, 36, had been under watch at Columbia University Irving Medical Center.

US president Donald Trump on Thursday visited the Federal Reserve’s renovation site in Washington, DC — and used the opportunity to take fresh shots at chair Jerome Powell.Standing in front of the half-finished project, Trump mocked the rising costs. “It looks like it’s about $3.1 billion. It went up a little bit — or a lot,” he said, while Powell shook his head in disagreement.Asked by a reporter how he’d handle such a budget mess as a developer, Trump didn’t hold back, “I’d fire him!”The central bank’s renovation was originally estimated at $1.9 billion. Now, it stands at $2.5 billion. The Fed says the hike is due to inflation, old infrastructure, and post-Covid material costs. But Trump and his aides say it's more than that — calling it excessive and accusing Powell of poor oversight.The visit was rare. Presidents usually avoid appearing to influence the independent central bank. But Trump has long clashed with Powell, criticising him for not lowering interest rates fast enough.At the site, Trump again pushed for rate cuts. “Our country is the hottest in the world right now,” he said. “But people can’t buy homes because the rates are too high.”The Fed is expected to hold rates steady again next week — despite mounting political pressure.","US president Donald Trump on Thursday visited the Federal Reserve’s renovation site in Washington, DC.

Tucker Carlson has raised concerns over Donald Trump’s handling of the renewed Epstein controversy.In an interview with Bild, the former Fox News anchor said people across the US were demanding clarity. “Normal people want to know what happened,” Carlson said. “It’s their right. Their government was involved.”Though he said he never met Epstein, Carlson questioned how the late financier gained access to heads of state and high-level officials without ever having a real job. ""So where did the money come from? And what was the point of this?,"" he said.He also dismissed the idea that Epstein’s death was a suicide. “It’s pretty clear he didn’t kill himself,” Carlson said.While staying diplomatic about Trump, Carlson said the US president ran on a promise to clean up Washington and expose corruption. ""Donald Trump ran for president on the promise that he would tell us, and that he’d end corruption in Washington. Now, that’s a big promise,"" he said.""I don’t think Trump had anything to do with Epstein, he knew Epstein. But I would be sincerely shocked if there was some weird sex stuff with Trump.I just don’t believe that. I’ve talked to Trump about it, I know him well,"" he added.As reports emerge showing Trump’s name in Epstein-related files, MAGA influencers and conservative voters are growing restless.While Carlosn, once a staunch Trump ally, has recently been at odds with Trump, some of Donald Trump’s staunchest supporters too are openly criticising how he’s dealing with the Epstein controversy, adding to growing calls from within the Republican camp to release the full files.Right-wing influencer Laura Loomer told Politico that the issue could “consume his presidency” if not addressed properly. She dismissed Trump’s claim that the files were part of a “hoax”, calling it unconvincing.Matt Walsh, host of The Matt Walsh Show, was also blunt — describing attorney general Pam Bondi’s response to the case as “humiliating”.",Tucker Carlson questions how late financier gained access to heads of state and high-level officials without ever having a real job.

"Scrap H-1B visa exception: Republicans introduce new bill for prioritizing Americans in universities, ending 'backdoor hiring'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/scrap-h-1b-visa-exception-republicans-introduce-new-bill-for-prioritizing-americans-in-universities-ending-backdoor-hiring/articleshow/122890474.cms,"Republican lawmakers introduce a new proposal to end H-1B exception for higher education staff.

H1-B process explained







Amid ongoing aspersions against the H-1B visa program, a new Republican proposal was introduced by Rep Tom Tiffany and Rep Andrew Clyde proposing to scrap the H-1B visa exception for higher education staff. Currently, there is a 65,000-person cap for the H-1B visa and an additional 20,000 persons for those with master's degree and beyond.The ""Colleges for the American People Act of 2025"" would repeal this additional exception and have those from other countries seeking to work in higher education go through the normal H-1B visa process.""American students spend years earning degrees, only to watch universities hand good-paying jobs to foreign workers on special visas,"" Tiffany said in a statement. ""The CAP Act ensures our institutions invest in the people they are meant to serve and ends the backdoor hiring practices that undercut American workers.""The proposal would not be retroactive, so current H-1B visa holders at universities could still apply for their extension without going towards the limit.For fiscal year 2026, US Citizenship and Immigration Services got enough petitions for the H-1B visa caps as of last week.The proposal comes as the DHS is planning to overhaul the H-1B system and replace the lottery with a wage-based selection. The H-1B remained a contentious issue for the Trump administration, as even before his January inauguration, he courted controversy over this visa program. During his last term, DHS issued a rule to base selection in H-1B petitions on the wage offered for a position. But the rule was shelved by the Biden administration.H-1B is mostly used by Silicon Valley companies but also by higher education institutions. The US employer first offers a job to a foreign worker, then files a labor condition application with the labor department, agreeing to pay the prevailing wage.The employer submits basic details of the person they hired during the registration window. USCIS runs a random lottery to select as it receives far more registrations than its cap. If selected in the lottery, the employer files Form I-129 with USCIS.","Republican lawmakers introduce a new proposal to end H-1B exception for higher education staff.

TOI correspondent from Washington:

Asim Munir for President? Pakistan Defence Minister Denies Amid Buzz Of Asif Ali Zardari Quitting





A political and diplomatic dogfight is underway over a prospective visit to Pakistan by US President Donald Trump en route to the Quad summit in India in September amid a gradual recalibration of ties in the region.Pakistani business leaders and influencers are working overtime to convince the White House of a Trump visit after pulling off a coup by arranging a luncheon meeting last month for the country's army chief Asim Munir with the US President.Munir charmed Trump by endorsing him for a Nobel Peace Prize, playing up to his craving for one, and the Pakistanis are now promising the US President more honors and trade access if he visits, despite having thrown itself at China's feet for survival.Although the White House has not confirmed Trump's Quad attendance given New Delhi is yet to nail the dates -- which also depends on the leaders of Japan and Australia -- Pakistan's excitable media broadcast that the US President would visit Pakistan on September 18, before retracting the report because Trump will be on a state visit to the UK from September 17-19.There are indications though that Trump may stopover in Pakistan whenever he heads out to the Quad summit.This could be as late as November given the MAGA supremo's obsession with trade deals over strategic alignments. He has just delivered a tariff shock to Japan and also riled up Australia, while India has proved to be a tough negotiator, frustrating his trade boffins attempts to strong-arm New Delhi into a quick deal.In fact, Trump's fetish for tariffs and his fixation on trade deals puts a question mark over the strategic salience of the Quad even as long-time allies and partners adjust to his mercurial approach.According to some diplomats, India itself may have to reassess its approach to Trump-era Washington after a rosy-eyed view of long-term strategic ties with the US. They acknowledge that Trump’s response during his second term to the Pakistani outreach – driven more by opportunism than any strategic vision – clearly caught India off guard. New Delhi resents the re-hyphenation that would be implicit in such a two-fer, but has no way of thwarting it.If Trump does visit Pakistan, it will be the first US Presidential trip to the country in nearly two decades after George W Bush layover in 2006. Bush stopped by in Islamabad for a few hours under a tight security blanket on his way back from a three-day visit to New Delhi, talking up counter-terrorism cooperation with Pakistan while rejecting its pleas for a nuclear deal similar to the one he forged with India.Presidents Obama and Biden both disdained even a stopover while Trump himself trashed Pakistan during his first term, accusing it of ""nothing but lies & deceit"" and providing ""safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan.""Pakistan is now promising to turn itself into a safe haven for US businesses promoted by Trump associates -- including transforming Islamabad into the ""crypto capital of South Asia"" and a ""global leader in the digital finance revolution,’ -- to land a Presidential visit.During his first term, Trump is famously said to have complained about landing in Iraq and Afghanistan with the lights on Air Force One turned off (as a security measure), despite the US having spent billions on the countries. If the Pakistan stopover comes through, he may well insist on landing in full sight – to soak up the fanfare and flattery.","Pakistani business leaders and influencers are working overtime to convince the White House of a Trump visit.

Baloch Rebels Launch ‘Operation Baam’; 17 Attacks Rock Pakistan’s Balochistan Province





Over the past two days, Baloch insurgent groups have claimed responsibility for a string of deadly attacks on Pakistani military forces in Balochistan, reportedly killing at least 27 soldiers, according to The Balochistan Post.The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) said its Fateh Squad targeted a military transport bus in Kalat’s Nimargh Cross area, killing 27 troops and injuring several others.The bus was reportedly ferrying personnel from Karachi to Quetta. BLA spokesperson Jeeyand Baloch stated that civilians, including qawwali performers on board, were not intended targets, though Dawn reported three civilian deaths, including two qawwals.In another incident, the BLA claimed to have killed two soldiers and injured seven with a remote-controlled IED in Quetta’s Hazarganji area.The Balochistan Liberation Front (BLF) also announced two separate operations. On Tuesday, it said an IED blast in Kalat’s Khazina area killed four soldiers. On Wednesday, it claimed to have ambushed a military unit in Awaran’s Gujro Kor area, killing six, including Major Syed Rab Nawaz Tariq from Muzaffarabad.Later, a sniper unit fired upon a nearby military convoy, forcing a retreatThe BLF denied state media reports that three of its ""fighters"" were killed, alleging that Pakistani forces may have staged fake encounters.Balochistan has witnessed a decades-long insurgency by separatist groups seeking independence from Pakistan, with Islamabad claiming the rebellion has been largely suppressed -- a claim challenged by continued militant violence.","Baloch insurgent groups have claimed responsibility for a string of deadly attacks on Pakistani military forces.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan said on Monday it was creating a national paramilitary force, prompting concern among opposition parties and human rights groups that it could be used as a tool of political repression.The move turns an existing paramilitary force deployed on Pakistan’s northwestern border with Afghanistan into a national security force that will be called the Federal Constabulary, state minister for the interior Talal Chaudhry told a press conference in the eastern city of Faisalabad. Its new duties will include internal security, riot control and counter-terrorism, according to a copy of the amended law reported by the local Dunya News TV.The announcement came after Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party of former jailed PM Imran Khan said it would stage nationwide protests starting on Aug 5, the second anniversary of his arrest. Several such protests since his Aug 2023 arrest have turned violent, in some cases paralysing the capital Islamabad for days.“This will be a new force. This will be a stronger force. We need this force for internal security,” Chaudhry said, adding that President Asif Ali Zardari had already approved amendments in the law introducing changes in the paramilitary force.The new force replaces the Frontier Constabulary (FC), whose cadres were previously recruited only from tribes in the northwestern province, Chaudhry said.Training of the new force will bring it into line with other national law enforcement agencies, he added. Khan’s party spokesperson Zulfikar Bukhari said the changes should be subject to parliamentary discussion.The new force “should not be used as a gimmick to silence political opponents, as has been previously witnessed when the government applied such laws against a large number of the PTI leadership and supporters,” he said. His concern was echoed by Haris Khalique, secretary of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, an independent body. “We are alarmed by the changes being made to the security and law enforcement structure of the country without any debate in parliament,” Khalique said.REUTERS","The move turns an existing paramilitary force deployed on Pakistan’s northwestern border with Afghanistan into a national security force.

Poliovirus found in 20 Pakistani districts amid rising vaccine refusals: New sewage data signals resurgence; 13th polio case confirmed in 2025,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/poliovirus-found-in-20-pakistani-districts-amid-rising-vaccine-refusals-new-sewage-data-signals-resurgence-13th-polio-case-confirmed-in-2025/articleshow/122421011.cms,"



Pakistan's battle against polio has hit a fresh setback, with the deadly virus detected in sewage samples across 20 districts, including the capital, just as the country grapples with rising vaccine refusal rates.According to ARY News, citing the National Reference Laboratory, 28 sewage samples collected between May 8 and June 17 tested positive for Wild Poliovirus Type 1 (WPV1). The presence of the virus was confirmed in major urban centres such as Lahore, Karachi, and Islamabad, as well as in districts across Sindh, Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir.Sindh reported the highest contamination, with 14 positive samples from 10 districts. Lahore recorded three cases, while Islamabad and four districts in KP also registered positive samples. In Balochistan, the virus was found in Mastung, Khuzdar, and Sibi. Mirpur in PoJK also showed signs of the virus.This alarming development follows Pakistan’s second national polio vaccination drive earlier this year, which saw over 60,000 refusals, 39,000 of them in Karachi alone. These refusals, officials say, are now posing a major roadblock to the country’s eradication efforts.“We’re not just fighting a virus; we’re battling misinformation and mistrust,” a senior health official told ARY News.Pakistan remains one of only two countries where polio is still endemic, the other being Afghanistan. With the confirmation of another new case this week, the total number of polio cases in the country has reached 13 so far in 2025.Health experts warn that the virus spreads primarily through contaminated water or food and can cause paralysis or death. There is no cure for polio, making vaccination the only defense. The World Health Organisation emphasises that multiple oral doses are needed to protect children under five, the group most vulnerable to the disease.Despite ongoing national campaigns, large pockets in southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa remain difficult to access for vaccination teams, leaving thousands of children at risk.As the virus resurfaces in urban and rural sewers alike, officials say the next phase in Pakistan’s anti-polio war must tackle both the virus, and vaccine hesitancy, with equal urgency.","Sindh reported the highest contamination, with 14 positive samples from 10 districts.

Pakistan’s economic performance under the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) $7 billion loan programme has been “strong so far”, according to Mahir Binici, the IMF’s Resident Representative for Pakistan, reported PTI.Speaking at a lecture hosted by the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) in Islamabad on Sunday, Binici said Pakistan’s first review under the three-year Extended Fund Facility (EFF), approved in July 2024, was successfully completed by the IMF Executive Board in May.The EFF aims to cement macroeconomic stability and lay the groundwork for “stronger, more inclusive and resilient growth,” he said. So far, Pakistan has received two instalments under the programme, with the government implementing agreed policy measures aimed at fiscal discipline and investor confidence.“Early policy measures have helped restore macroeconomic stability and rebuild investor confidence, despite persistent external challenges,” Binici noted.He stressed the importance of structural reforms to ensure long-term economic sustainability, including strengthening tax equity, improving the business climate, and encouraging private-sector-led investment.Binici also welcomed Pakistan’s commitment to climate-related reforms under the $1.3 billion Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF), approved in March.The RSF supports projects focused on disaster preparedness, efficient water use, green investments, and better climate data transparency.“Support through the RSF will not only strengthen Pakistan’s climate resilience but also help unlock green investments and foster a more climate-conscious economic trajectory,” he said.On regional prospects, Binici said economic growth in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, including Pakistan, was expected to improve in 2025 and beyond. However, he warned that global economic uncertainty remains high due to trade tensions, geopolitical fragmentation, and weakening cooperation.","Pakistan's economic performance under IMF's $7 billion loan programme has been'strong so far' Mahir Binici, the IMF’s Resident Representative for Pakistan, spoke at a lecture in Islamabad.

A protest over a prolonged power outage in Karachi’s Punjab Colony spiraled into city-wide traffic chaos on Saturday, underscoring what many see as chronic governance failure and energy mismanagement in Pakistan, Dawn reported.Residents of an 80-flat, 10-storey building blocked a major road near Punjab Chowrangi after going more than 24 hours without electricity. Power had reportedly been out since 11 am Friday, and despite repeated complaints, K-Electric, Karachi’s sole power distributor, allegedly failed to respond.The resulting sit-in crippled traffic on Defence Road and nearby areas. Long queues of trucks and tankers vital to Karachi Port were stalled from Qayyumabad to the KPT Flyover. Major intersections like Boat Basin, Gizri, and Hino Chowrangi were brought to a standstill, leaving thousands of commuters stranded, according to Dawn.The outage reportedly followed K-Electric’s anti-theft operation in the adjacent P&T Colony. Protesters claimed legal connections were also cut off in the sweep, with no clear procedure followed. KE, however, described the protestors as ""miscreants"" attempting to restore illegal connections and said their teams were attacked during the operation, allegedly linked to a cable TV network.No evidence was provided implicating all affected residents in theft.While KE later claimed to have restored power to parts of the area, the larger issue remains unresolved. The incident highlights Pakistan’s ongoing struggle to provide reliable electricity, exacerbated by outdated infrastructure and lack of accountability in power distribution.As Dawn noted, the crisis is less about one blackout and more a reflection of systemic dysfunction, where citizens bear the brunt of institutional failure.","Residents of an 80-flat, 10-storey building blocked a major road near Punjab Chowrangi after going more than 24 hours without electricity.

Afghanistan was rocked by two more earthquakes early Saturday with a magnitude of around 4.0 on Richter scale, marking fifth such seismic event in the past week, according to the National Center for Seismology (NCS).The first tremor, recorded at 1.26 am IST, measured 4.2 on the Richter scale with a depth of 190 km. The second quake struck just 45 minutes later at 2:11 am IST, registering a magnitude of 4.0 and a depth of 125 km. Both events were located in the northern region of Afghanistan, based on NCS data.On Friday night, another quake measuring 4.6 also shook the region. Earlier in the week, two more quakes of magnitudes 4.7 and 4.3 were reported, making this the fifth seismic jolt since July 17.Afghanistan’s vulnerability to frequent and often destructive earthquakes stems from its location at the convergence of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates. The Hindu Kush mountain range, in particular, experiences frequent tremors and aftershocks.The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) notes that Afghanistan remains highly prone to natural disasters including earthquakes, landslides, and seasonal floods. These events further strain communities already grappling with decades of conflict and limited infrastructure, making disaster response and recovery particularly challenging.","The first tremor measured 4.2 on the Richter scale with a depth of 190 km.

UK pact comes amid tariff turmoil created by Trump

LONDON/NEW DELHI: More than three years after they began negotiations, and amid intense uncertainty in the global trade ecosystem, India and the UK finally signed a Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, which slashes duties on both sides. It also makes it more predictable for investors and business workers to get visas, and allows access for audit and accounting firms in the two countries as part of efforts to more than double bilateral trade from the current $56 billion by 2030.Consumers can look forward to cheaper British-made cars, cosmetics, medical devices and Scotch, as govt has agreed to slash average tariffs from 15% to 3%. The zero duty import list also includes silver - the largest item in the UK's export basket ($2.1 billion last fiscal). But all the changes won't happen overnight, with some duty cuts planned over 10 years, allowing Indian industry time to adjust.In return, govt got the UK to allow zero duty import on 99% of product lines. ""This is more than just an economic partnership; it is also a blueprint for shared prosperity. It paves the way for enhanced market access in the UK for Indian textiles, footwear, gems and jewellery, seafood, and engineering goods. It will also unlock new opportunities for India's agricultural produce and processed food industry. Above all, this agreement will be especially beneficial for India's youth, farmers, fishermen, and the MSME sector,"" PM Modi said.Govt has, however, managed to keep several agricultural products such as oats, apples, edible oil and sensitive seeds, as well as dairy outside the ambit of tariff reduction.""We're living through a new and more dangerous global era... we believe building stronger partnerships is the best response... today we are confirming this approach in our new deal with India - the biggest and most economically significant trade deal for the UK since leaving the EU,"" said British PM Keir Starmer.The India-UK trade agreement, announced on May 6, but formalised at Chequers, the official country residence of British PM, came amid tariff turmoil caused by US President Donald Trump's moves, prompting countries to not just rush to Washington to strike deals but also speed up negotiations on other treaties.India is ready to roll out treaty with European Free Trade Association, comprising Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, from Oct, while seeking to finalise the agreement with EU after 18 long years of talks.

But the CETA with the UK is unlikely to be implemented for at least a year as it requires British legislative approval.The pact with the UK, which was in the making for three-and-a-half years, required significant give-and-take, with India managing to keep a bilateral investment treaty out of the current deal, just as the UK did not agree to carve-outs on carbon tax for Indian products.India also claimed victory in getting a more predictable visa regime for business and professional visitors, but the bigger gain is in the form of a Double Contribution Convention, which will ensure that Indian workers in the UK for up to three years do not have to contribute to the National Insurance (NI) system there, while also seeing deductions towards Employees' Provident Fund Organisation. But it did offer some major concessions. Trade research body GTRI argued that govt's promise for ""adequate remuneration"" to patent holders when compulsory licensing provisions are invoked risks delays.In addition, govt opened an estimated 40,000 central contracts above a certain value to UK businesses, who would be granted local contractor status with 20% or more domestic content.","India and the UK have signed a Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement. Tariffs eliminated on 99% Indian exports to UK. UK PM Keir Starmer: ""This is the biggest and most economically significant trade deal for the UK since leaving the EU"" Deal comes amid tariff turmoil created by Trump.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122891518,imgsize-1036233,width-400,resizemode-4/122891518.jpg"
"Visa boost for desi professionals, chefs in trade agreement",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/visa-boost-for-desi-professionals-chefs-in-trade-agreement/articleshow/122891211.cms,"NEW DELHI: Independent professionals as well as business visitors, company executives and investors can expect a more predictable visa regime to the United Kingdom once the trade deal signed Thursday is implemented.The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement seeks to ""lock in"" business mobility rules for Indian business visitors attending meetings and conferences, experienced employees, graduate trainees, investors, as well as musicians, chefs and yoga teachers. The British govt will, however, closely monitor eligibility norms to avoid a large influx.For instance, senior executives of service sector companies with branches in India and UK will get visas for three years. Contractual service providers across more sectors will be eligible for business visas of up to 12 months.Govt sources said the UK has agreed not to impose numerical limits on Indian business mobility and won't require Indian companies to advertise locally before applying for these visas. Last year, the UK granted 25,117 visas under the Global Business Mobility route. The deal provides for 1,800 annual visas to Indian musicians, chefs and yoga teachers.Indian nurses, accountants and other professionals can look forward to academic qualifications being recognised in the UK, as the deal pushes for mutual recognition agreements.India has kept legal services out of bounds but agreed to let British accounting and audit firms set up shop here, provided the UK offers reciprocal access. Like in the Australian ECTA, architectural services are now open to British firms. The UK has made offers across 12 major services sectors and 137 sub-sectors. India will open 11 sectors and 108 sub-sectors.While India has locked in 100% FDI in telecom, insurance and aviation, it refused to ease cap on British banks opening more branches.The deal also facilitates Indian educational institutions & hospitals expanding into UK.","The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement seeks to ""lock in"" business mobility rules for Indian business visitors.

"With zero duty access, India eyes boom in key exports",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/with-zero-duty-access-india-eyes-boom-in-key-exports/articleshow/122891051.cms,"Union commerce minister Piyush Goyal and his British counterpart Jonathan Reynold during the signing of the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA), in the UK.





NEW DELHI: Indian negotiators are targeting labour-intensive goods and services to boost India's tiny 1.9% share of UK imports. The new trade pact promises zero- or near-zero tariffs on textiles, leather and footwear, engineering goods, chemicals and pharmaceuticals - relief the government says will make Indian exports far more competitive.Government said 99% items of trade (called tariff lines), comprising 100% of India's exports, are covered in the deal.In textiles, for instance, there are 1,143 items on which zero-duty market access will be provided to Indian goods, blunting the duty advantage that Bangladesh, Cambodia and Pakistan have so far enjoyed. So, readymade garments or home textiles, carpets, handicrafts and traditional items such as pashmina shawls or Kanchipuram or bandhini sarees are expected to gain. India is fourth-largest textile supplier to UK, accounting for over 6% of imports.Government officials said India hopes to outperform competitors such as Vietnam, Indonesia, Cambodia, Turkey and Bangladesh in the footwear market, especially athleisure and sports shoes, in addition to Vellore and Kolhapuri chappals and traditional leather shoes. In recent years, several large sports shoe manufacturers have tied up with Indian producers to make footwear for brands like Puma, Adidas and New Balance for domestic and global markets.There are sectors where India has a large presence in other markets but a limited share of the British market. Indian exporters hope to replace competitors across a variety of engineering goods, including machinery and components, where zero-duty access will be provided to 1,659 items. With exports of $4.3 billion, India holds a small share of the $194 billion machinery imports by British businesses. Govt is projecting to double the value of exports by March 2030.India also has a small share in UK's pharma imports - only $1 billion out of $30 billion in 2024. The govt is eyeing gains in not just generics but also medical devices such as ECG machines and X-ray systems.For chemicals, where India's exports to UK were $570 million last year, the government is betting on a 30-40% jump in the first year itself as over 1,200 chemicals will be given duty-free access. Businesses are eyeing an opportunity in gems and jewellery sector, where exports are now pegged at $940 million.Although government has maintained that it has not opened several critical agricultural sectors such as dairy, apples, edible oil and oats under the Comprehensive Economic & Trade Agreement, it hopes to push Indian grapes, processed food, bakery items and marine products into UK supermarkets.A lot of the market access in these segments will also depend on the quality standards that the UK puts in place and also other trade deals that it enters into in the coming months.","Indian negotiators are targeting labour-intensive goods and services to boost India's tiny 1.9% share of UK imports.

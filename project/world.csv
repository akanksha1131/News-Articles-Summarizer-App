How much does it cost to go to space like Katy Perry?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/how-much-does-it-cost-to-go-to-space-like-katy-perry/articleshow/120295675.cms,"Picture credit: Blue Origin

A steep price tag



What Katy Perry, Blue Origin crew saw in space

Fame flies free



If you can pay



Singer Katy Perry joined a Blue Origin flight on Monday alongside five other women, making headlines as part of the first all-female space crew in over 60 years.Blue Origin’s well-known New Shepard spacecraft can carry up to six passengers on a short journey beyond the Earth’s atmosphere, allowing them to experience weightlessness and see the planet from space.As of the latest launch on Monday morning, only 58 people have travelled more than 60 miles above Earth with Blue Origin since it began crewed missions in 2021.On May 19, 2024, Indian-born entrepreneur Gopi Thotakura made history by becoming the first Indian citizen to take part in a space tourism flight.How much would it cost for an ordinary person to take a similar trip?For those hoping to experience space tourism, it isn’t cheap. While Blue Origin doesn’t openly display ticket prices, its website does ask potential flyers to submit personal details and agree to a $150,000 deposit.Reports show that seats on earlier flights have fetched millions. One was even auctioned off for $28 million in 2021, writes USA today.The flyer also needs to be 18 years or older.Not everyone pays. Celebrities like William Shatner and Michael Strahan reportedly didn’t pay a rupee for their spaceflights.Other companies are offering similar experiences. A seat on Virgin Galactic’s sub-orbital flights costs around $450,000.In 2021, SpaceX launched a fully civilian mission into orbit, funded by billionaire Jared Isaacman, currently nominated to be Nasa chief, at an estimated cost of $220 million.For now, a seat to space is reserved for the ultra-rich or the ultra-famous. But the growing number of private players may one day bring the stars closer to the rest of us.","Singer Katy Perry joined a Blue Origin flight on Monday alongside five other women, making headlines as part of the first all-female space crew in over 60 years.

The crew reached an altitude of more than 100 kilometres, crossing the Kármán line — the internationally recognised boundary of space — and experienced a brief moment of weightlessness before returning for a smooth landing.This marks Blue Origin’s first all-women crewed mission and the first all-female spaceflight since Valentina Tereshkova’s historic solo journey in 1963. Joining Perry, King, and Sánchez were former Nasa rocket scientist Aisha Bowe, civil rights advocate Amanda Nguyen, and film producer Kerianne Flynn.“I've always been interested in the stars. We’re all made of stardust,” said Perry ahead of the flight, adding that she prepared by immersing herself in astrophysics and the works of Carl Sagan. The singer, who is known for cosmic-themed songs like E.T. and Firework, said the experience was about more than reaching space. “You're brave, you're bold… No limitations,” she said, describing the message she hopes to send to young girls. “Being a mother just makes you level up with that type of power,” she added, referring to her daughter Daisy.Blue Origin described the mission as a landmark moment for women in space exploration. The mission patch featured personalised symbols representing each woman’s legacy and contribution. During ascent, the New Shepard capsule soared at speeds over three times the speed of sound before returning to the Texas desert.","The rocket lifted off just after 8:30 am local time from West Texas, carrying six women aboard the fully automated New Shepard capsule.

'Investment is not an entitlement': Trump admin freezes $2.2 billion in grants to Harvard,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-administration-freezes-2-2-billion-federal-funding-over-white-houses-campus-anti-semitism-mandate/articleshow/120294516.cms,"Harvard University in Cambridge (File photo)

What the Trump administration wanted from Harvard?

Harvard's response the demands

The Trump administration announced Monday it will freeze $2.2 billion in grants and $60 million in contracts for Harvard after the university refused to comply with its policy demands concerning changes in its policies.The mandates, issued in an April 3 directive, required changes to university governance, hiring and admissions processes, the closure of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) offices, and cooperation with federal immigration screenings for international students.The Joint Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism that suspended the fundings and grants cited concerns about elite universities’ commitment to civil rights and responsible use of taxpayer funds. ""Harvard's statement today reinforces the troubling entitlement mindset that is endemic in our nation's most prestigious universities and colleges - that federal investment does not come with the responsibility to uphold civil rights laws,"" it said.""The disruption of learning that has plagued campuses in recent years is unacceptable. The harassment of Jewish students is intolerable. It is time for elite universities to take the problem seriously and commit to meaningful change if they wish to continue receiving taxpayer support,"" it added to it statement.In a letter dated April 11 to Harvard President Alan Garber, US officials accused Harvard of failing to uphold federal civil rights laws and academic standards that justify continued federal investment. The letter outlined a set of strict reforms the university must implement by August 2025. ""The United States has invested in Harvard University’s operations because of the value to the country of scholarly discovery and academic excellence. But an investment is not an entitlement. It depends on Harvard upholding federal civil rights laws, and it only makes sense if Harvard fosters the kind of environment that produces intellectual creativity and scholarly rigor, both of which are antithetical to ideological capture."" it said.""Harvard has in recent years failed to live up to both the intellectual and civil rights conditions that justify federal investment. But we appreciate your expression of commitment to repairing those failures and welcome your collaboration in restoring the University to its promise. We therefore present the below provisions as the basis for an agreement in principle that will maintain Harvard’s financial relationship with the federal government,"" it added while listing out the demands for the ivy league university which included governance and leadership demands, merit-based hiring reforms, international admissions reforms, discontinuation of DEI, whistleblower reporting and ensuring transparency.In its response, Harvard President Alan Garber declared the university would not “negotiate over its independence or its constitutional rights.” Garber claimed that while the university is committed to addressing discrimination, it rejects federal overreach into academic autonomy. “The University will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights,” Garber wrote in a message to the community, as per the Harvard Gazette. “No government — regardless of which party is in power — should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue,"" he added.Garber's response came after the government issued a list of requirements prior to announcing the funding freeze. These included detailed assessments of academic divisions and departments, evaluations of perspectives from students, faculty, and staff, as well as proposed changes to Harvard's administrative structure and recruitment procedures.Following the order, Harvard Law School professor Nikolas Bowie gave a statement to CNN’s News Central saying, “What the President of the United States is demanding of universities is nothing short of authoritarian."" “He is violating the First Amendment rights of universities and faculty by demanding that if universities want to keep this money, they have to suppress our speech and change what we teach and how we study,” he added.This action follows heightened tensions on campuses nationwide, particularly after pro-Palestinian protests erupted in response to Israel’s military operations in Gaza. Some demonstrations led to confrontations with law enforcement and pro-Israel counter-protesters.Republican leaders, including President Donald Trump, have equated certain activist groups with Hamas—the US-designated terrorist organization whose October 7, 2023 attack on Israel sparked the current conflict.In March, the US Department of Education launched investigations into 60 academic institutions over reports of anti-Semitic incidents.Despite revealing a £45 million operating surplus from £6.5 billion in revenue last fiscal year, Harvard firmly rejected demands it deemed excessive and outside federal authority. Garber reiterated that political interference in academic decisions is unacceptable, regardless of party affiliation.Representative Elise Stefanik, a New York Republican known for her staunch support of Jewish and Israeli causes, has been a vocal critic of Harvard’s leadership. She praised the funding freeze, calling Harvard emblematic of higher education’s decline.Unlike Harvard, Columbia University chose to comply with similar White House mandates, forfeiting $400 million in federal grants after failing to adequately protect Jewish students during protests. Columbia has since implemented new disciplinary policies and increased security measures.Meanwhile, immigration authorities have pursued action against Columbia-based pro-Palestinian organizers. Mahmoud Khalil is undergoing deportation proceedings, and Mohsen Mahdawi was detained during his US citizenship interview.","The Trump administration announced Monday it will freeze $2.2 billion in grants and $60 million in contracts for Harvard after the university refused to comply with its policy demands. The mandates, issued in an April 3 directive, required changes to university governance, hiring and admissions processes, and cooperation with federal immigration screenings for international students.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120295596,imgsize-2156543,width-400,resizemode-4/article-91.jpg"
Watch: Elephants at San Diego Zoo form protective huddle during earthquake to shield calves,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/watch-elephants-at-san-diego-zoo-form-protective-huddle-during-earthquake-to-shield-calves/articleshow/120294980.cms,"Watch: Elephants at San Diego zoo huddle to protect calves during earthquake

As a 5.2-magnitude earthquake shook Southern California on Monday morning, a herd of African elephants at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park instinctively sprang into action to protect their young, forming a defensive huddle that was captured on video.Footage from the enclosure shows the elephants calmly standing under the morning sun when the ground begins to tremble. Startled, they first scatter, then quickly regroup as the older matriarchs — Ndlula, Umngani, and Khosi — close ranks around the two calves, Zuli and Mkhaya. The adult elephants hold their formation, ears spread and alert, for several minutes even after the shaking stops.“They sort of freeze as they gather information about where the danger is,” said Mindy Albright, curator of mammals at the park.The incident, which highlights elephants’ powerful social bonds and protective instincts, occurred around 10:10 a.m. near Julian, the quake's epicenter. While the tremor was felt as far as Los Angeles and Tijuana and caused boulders to tumble onto rural roads, no major injuries or damage were reported.According to Albright, the elephants' reaction is typical of their behaviour in the wild. When threatened, elephant herds often form an “alert circle” — young in the centre, adults facing outward — to defend against potential dangers. In the video, one calf runs straight to the safety of the adults, while the male calf, Zuli, hesitates on the edge, showing a streak of youthful independence. He is gently coaxed back by Khosi, who taps him reassuringly with her trunk.“It's so great to see them doing the thing we all should be doing — that any parent does, which is protect their children,” Albright said.About an hour later, when an aftershock hit, the elephants briefly huddled again before returning to their normal routine, staying close together in a show of continued solidarity.","A 5.2-magnitude earthquake shook Southern California on Monday morning.

Katy Perry, Lauren Sanchez, Aisha Bowe, Amanda Nguyen, Gayle King and Kerianne Flynn flew to space today for 11 minutes in the Blue Origin NS-31. The no-pilot automatic rocket took off at 9.30am from Texas and will pass just above the Karman line, which is generally regarded as the edge of space and is an invisible boundary at a height of 62 miles. The crew then took parachutes and landed in the Texas desert. Oprah was there at the station to witness the lift-off.This is the first female-only crew since Valentina Tereshkova launched into orbit on a solo mission in 1963.So, they all got designer space suits designed by Fernando Garcia and Laura Kim, the co-founders of Monse, and also the creative directors at luxury fashion brand Oscar de la Renta.Jeff Bezos' fiancee Lauren Sanchez roped in the designers for stylish suits for her girl gang in space, which also make them look like astronauts.

Katy Perry's comment that they -- the stylish girl gang -- are putting the 'a**' in astronaut has not gone down well.Democratic leader Nina Turner said Jeff Bezos should pay a wealth tax for healthcare if he can splurge so much to send Katy Perry into space.

Vetting does not end once a visa is granted



How does one's visa get revoked?



With green card holders now fearing their stay in the US after Columbia University student Mahmoud Khalil's arrest for leading anti-Israel protests last year, Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said that revoking visas when threats arise is a way to make America safer. In an opinion piece for Fox News, Marco Rubio wrote that visiting America is not an entitlement and as the Secretary of State, he will never forget that it is a privilege extended to those who respect laws and values.Rubio said that US laws are clear about who can and cannot come to the United States. Each visa application is vetted through those rules and people who ""endorse or espouse"" terrorist activity or ""persuade others to endorse or espouse terrorist activity"" are ineligible for US visas.Revoking visas is not any highhandedness on the part of the Trump administration, he explained as he said the Immigration and Nationality Act gives the administration a broad authority to revoke a visa. ""This authority is fundamental to safeguarding our national security, as well as protecting Americans and lawful visitors within our borders. The Trump administration’s commitment to security and the enforcement of our immigration laws is unprecedented and unwavering. We expect – and the law requires – all visa holders to demonstrate their eligibility every day their visa is valid. This includes respecting our laws, behaving appropriately according to their visa type, and continuing to meet these standards throughout their stay in our country,"" he wrote.Marco Rubio explained in his piece that once a visa is granted, it is not forever. The US government's rigorous security vetting does not end once a visa is granted. And evert US visa holder should know this, Marco Rubio said. ""Working together with DHS and other law-enforcement and security agencies, we continuously monitor and review these cases. This vigilance is essential because circumstances can and do change,"" he wrote.Marco Rubio gave examples of incidents like a violent crime or drunk driving or supporting terrorism, overstaying the time permitted for their visit, performing illegal work etc for revoking the visas. ""When information about such activities comes to the department’s attention, our expert staff review it and assess whether revocation is appropriate,"" he wrote.""There are over 1.1 million foreign students in the United States, including at our nation’s most elite universities. In the aftermath of the October 7, 2023 terrorist attacks against Israel, some of these foreign student visitors engaged in antisemitic activities and intimidation of Americans, many who happened to be of the Jewish faith. These foreigners shut down college campuses for American citizens, harassed Jewish students, blocked highways, and stormed buildings. The Trump administration is committed to taking the necessary steps to stop these activities at American universities,"" Rubio wrote.US visas are a privilege, rather that a right and it's reserved for those who make the United States better, the secretary of state said.","Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the US government's rigorous security vetting does not end once a visa is granted.

El Salvador president Nayib Bukele said he does not have the power to return Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia who was mistakenly deported to his country back to the US. He said this sitting beside President Donald Trump as the two met in the Oval Office in their first meeting after the US sent plane-loads of Tren de Aragua terrorists to El Salvador. Maryland's Kilmar was also sent to Salvador but it was an administrative error, and now his return to the US hangs in balance as Salvador's president asks how he can return him to the US. ""Like, I smuggle him into the United States?”Asked by reporters at the Oval Office on Monday whether he has the power to release Abrego Garcia inside El Salvador, Bukele said he does, but that his administration isn’t “very fond of releasing terrorists” in his country.“You want us to us to go back to releasing criminals so we can go back to being the murder capital of the world? That’s not going to happen,” he said.Attorney General Pam Bondi said if El Salvador decided to return Garcia, then the US would provide a plane as there's a Supreme Court ruling to that effect. “Additional paperwork had needed to be done. That’s up to El Salvador if they want to return him. That’s not up to us. The Supreme Court ruled that if El Salvador wants to return him … we would facilitate it: meaning, return a plane,” Bondi who was also present at the Oval Office during the meeting said.White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller also pointed out that Abrego Garcia is a citizen of El Salvador, suggesting it was “very arrogant” for American media to “tell El Salvador how to handle their own citizens.”",El Salvador president Nayib Bukele said he does not have the power to return Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia who was mistakenly deported to his country back to the US.

Read the full letter by the Trump administration

The United States has invested in

Harvard

University’s operations because of the value to the country of scholarly discovery and academic excellence. But an investment is not an entitlement. It depends on Harvard upholding federal civil rights laws, and it only makes sense if Harvard fosters the kind of environment that produces intellectual creativity and scholarly rigor, both of which are antithetical to ideological capture.

Harvard has in recent years failed to live up to both the intellectual and civil rights conditions that justify federal investment. But we appreciate your expression of commitment to repairing those failures and welcome your collaboration in restoring the University to its promise. We therefore present the below provisions as the basis for an agreement in principle that will maintain Harvard’s financial relationship with the federal government.

If acceptable to Harvard, this document will constitute an agreement in principle, which the parties will work in good faith to translate into a more thorough, binding settlement agreement. As you will see, this letter incorporates and supersedes the terms of the federal government’s prior letter of April 3, 2025.

● Governance and leadership reforms. By August 2025, Harvard must make meaningful governance reform and restructuring to make possible major change consistent with this letter, including: fostering clear lines of authority and accountability; empowering tenured professors and senior leadership, and, from among the tenured professoriate and senior leadership, exclusively those most devoted to the scholarly mission of the University and committed to the changes indicated in this letter; reducing the power held by students and untenured faculty; reducing the power held by faculty (whether tenured or untenured) and administrators more committed to activism than scholarship; and reducing forms of governance bloat, duplication, or decentralization that interfere with the possibility of the reforms indicated in this letter.

● Merit-Based Hiring Reform. By August 2025, the University must adopt and implement merit-based hiring policies, and cease all preferences based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin throughout its hiring, promotion, compensation, and related practices among faculty, staff, and leadership. Such adoption and implementation must be durable and demonstrated through structural and personnel changes. All existing and prospective faculty shall be reviewed for plagiarism and Harvard’s plagiarism policy consistently enforced. All hiring and related data shall be shared with the federal government and subjected to a comprehensive audit by the federal government during the period in which reforms are being implemented, which shall be at least until the end of 2028.

● Merit-Based Admissions Reform. By August 2025, the University must adopt and implement merit-based admissions policies and cease all preferences based on race, color, national origin, or proxies thereof, throughout its undergraduate program, each graduate program individually, each of its professional schools, and other programs. Such adoption and implementation must be durable and demonstrated through structural and personnel changes. All admissions data shall be shared with the federal government and subjected to a comprehensive audit by the federal government—and non-individualized, statistical information regarding admissions shall be made available to the public, including information about rejected and admitted students broken down by race, color, national origin, grade point average, and performance on standardized tests—during the period in which reforms are being implemented, which shall be at least until the end of 2028. During this same period, the dean of admissions for each program or school must sign a public statement after each admissions cycle certifying that these rules have been upheld.

● International Admissions Reform. By August 2025, the University must reform its recruitment, screening, and admissions of international students to prevent admitting students hostile to the American values and institutions inscribed in the U.S. Constitution and Declaration of Independence, including students supportive of terrorism or anti-Semitism. Harvard will immediately report to federal authorities, including the Department of Homeland Security and State Department, any foreign student, including those on visas and with green cards, who commits a conduct violation. As above, these reforms must be durable and demonstrated through structural and personnel changes; comprehensive throughout all of Harvard’s programs; and, during the reform period, shared with the federal government for audit, shared on a non-individualized basis with the public, and certified by deans of admissions.

● Viewpoint Diversity in Admissions and Hiring. By August 2025, the University shall commission an external party, which shall satisfy the federal government as to its competence and good faith, to audit the student body, faculty, staff, and leadership for viewpoint diversity, such that each department, field, or teaching unit must be individually viewpoint diverse. This audit shall begin no later than the summer of 2025 and shall proceed on a department-by-department, field-by-field, or teaching-unit-by-teaching-unit basis as appropriate. The report of the external party shall be submitted to University leadership and the federal government no later than the end of 2025. Harvard must abolish all criteria, preferences, and practices, whether mandatory or optional, throughout its admissions and hiring practices, that function as ideological litmus tests. Every department or field found to lack viewpoint diversity must be reformed by hiring a critical mass of new faculty within that department or field who will provide viewpoint diversity; every teaching unit found to lack viewpoint diversity must be reformed by admitting a critical mass of students who will provide viewpoint diversity. If the review finds that the existing faculty in the relevant department or field are not capable of hiring for viewpoint diversity, or that the relevant teaching unit is not capable of admitting a critical mass of students with diverse viewpoints, hiring or admissions within that department, field, or teaching unit shall be transferred to the closest cognate department, field, or teaching unit that is capable of achieving viewpoint diversity. This audit shall be performed and the same steps taken to establish viewpoint diversity every year during the period in which reforms are being implemented, which shall be at least until the end of 2028.

● Reforming Programs with Egregious Records of Antisemitism or Other

Bias

. By August 2025, the University shall commission an external party, which shall satisfy the federal government as to its competence and good faith, to audit those programs and departments that most fuel antisemitic harassment or reflect ideological capture.

o The programs, schools, and centers of concern include but are not limited to the Divinity School, Graduate School of Education, School of Public Health, Medical School, Religion and Public Life Program, FXB Center for Health & Human Rights, Center for Middle Eastern Studies, Carr Center for Human Rights at the Harvard Kennedy School, Department of Near Eastern Languages and Cultures, and the Harvard Law School International Human Rights Clinic.

The report of the external party shall include information as to individual facult members who discriminated against Jewish or Israeli students or incited students to violate Harvard’s rules following October 7, and the University and federal government will cooperate to determine appropriate sanctions for those faculty members within the bounds of academic freedom and the First Amendment.

The report of the external party shall be submitted to University leadership and the federal government no later than the end of 2025 and reforms undertaken to repair the problems. This audit shall be performed and the same steps taken to make repairs every year during the period in which reforms are being implemented, which shall be at least until the end of 2028.

● Discontinuation of DEI. The University must immediately shutter all diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, offices, committees, positions, and initiatives, under whatever name, and stop all DEI-based policies, including DEI-based disciplinary or speech control policies, under whatever name; demonstrate that it has done so to the satisfaction of the federal government; and demonstrate to the satisfaction of the federal government that these reforms are durable and effective through structural and personnel changes. By August 2025, the University must submit to the government a report—certified for accuracy—that confirms these reforms.

● Student Discipline Reform and Accountability. Harvard must immediately reform its student discipline policies and procedures so as to swiftly and transparently enforce its existing disciplinary policies with consistency and impartiality, and without double standards based on identity or ideology. Where those policies are insufficient to prevent the disruption of scholarship, classroom learning and teaching, or other aspects of normal campus life, Harvard must develop and implement disciplinary policies sufficient to prevent those disruptions. This includes but is not limited to the following:

Discipline at Harvard must include immediate intervention and stoppage of disruptions or deplatforming, including by the Harvard police when necessary to stop a disruption or deplatforming; robust enforcement and reinstatement of existing time, place, and manner rules on campus, including ordering the Harvard police to stop incidents that violate time, place, and manner rules when necessary; a disciplinary process housed in one body that is accountable to Harvard’s president or other capstone official; and removing or reforming institutional bodies and practices that delay and obstruct enforcement, including the relevant Administrative Boards and

FAS Faculty Council.

Harvard must adopt a new policy on student groups or clubs that forbids the recognition and funding of, or provision of accommodations to, any student group or club that endorses or promotes criminal activity, illegal violence, or illegal harassment; invites non-students onto campus who regularly violate campus rules; or acts as a front for a student club that has been banned from campus. The leaders or organizers of recognized and unrecognized student groups that violate these policies must be held accountable as a matter of student discipline and made ineligible to serve as officers in other recognized student organizations. In the future, funding decisions for student groups or clubs must be made exclusively by a body of University faculty accountable to senior University leadership. In particular, Harvard must end support and recognition of those student groups or clubs that engaged in anti-Semitic activity since October 7th, 2023, including the Harvard Palestine Solidarity Committee, Harvard Graduates Students 4 Palestine, Law Students 4 Palestine, Students for Justice in Palestine, and the National Lawyers Guild, and discipline and render ineligible the officers and active members of those student organizations.

Harvard must implement a comprehensive mask ban with serious and immediate penalties for violation, not less than suspension.

Harvard must investigate and carry out meaningful discipline for all violations that occurred during the 2023-2024 and 2024-2025 academic years, including the Harvard Business School protest of October 2023, the University Hall sit-in of November 2023, and the spring encampment of 2024. This must include permanently expelling the students involved in the October 18 assault of an Israeli Harvard Business School student, and suspending students involved in occupying university buildings, as warranted by the facts of individual cases.

The Harvard president and police chief must publicly clarify that the Harvard University Police Department will enforce University rules and the law. Harvard must also commit to cooperating in good faith with law enforcement.

Harvard letter's full text

For three-quarters of a century, the federal government has awarded grants and contracts to Harvard and other universities to help pay for work that, along with investments by the universities themselves, has led to groundbreaking innovations across a wide range of medical, engineering, and scientific fields. These innovations have made countless people in our country and throughout the world healthier and safer. In recent weeks, the federal government has threatened its partnerships with several universities, including Harvard, over accusations of antisemitism on our campuses. These partnerships are among the most productive and beneficial in American history. New frontiers beckon us with the prospect of life-changing advances—from treatments for diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and diabetes, to breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, quantum science and engineering, and numerous other areas of possibility. For the government to retreat from these partnerships now risks not only the health and well-being of millions of individuals but also the economic security and vitality of our nation.

Late Friday night, the administration issued an updated and expanded list of demands, warning that Harvard must comply if we intend to “maintain [our] financial relationship with the federal government.” It makes clear that the intention is not to work with us to address antisemitism in a cooperative and constructive manner. Although some of the demands outlined by the government are aimed at combating antisemitism, the majority represent direct governmental regulation of the “intellectual conditions” at Harvard.

I encourage you to read the letter to gain a fuller understanding of the unprecedented demands being made by the federal government to control the Harvard community. They include requirements to “audit” the viewpoints of our student body, faculty, staff, and to “reduc[e] the power” of certain students, faculty, and administrators targeted because of their ideological views. We have informed the administration through our legal counsel that we will not accept their proposed agreement. The University will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights.

The administration’s prescription goes beyond the power of the federal government. It violates Harvard’s First Amendment rights and exceeds the statutory limits of the government’s authority under Title VI. And it threatens our values as a private institution devoted to the pursuit, production, and dissemination of knowledge. No government—regardless of which party is in power—should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue.

Our motto—Veritas, or truth—guides us as we navigate the challenging path ahead. Seeking truth is a journey without end. It requires us to be open to new information and different perspectives, to subject our beliefs to ongoing scrutiny, and to be ready to change our minds. It compels us to take up the difficult work of acknowledging our flaws so that we might realize the full promise of the University, especially when that promise is threatened.

We have made it abundantly clear that we do not take lightly our moral duty to fight antisemitism. Over the past fifteen months, we have taken many steps to address antisemitism on our campus. We plan to do much more. As we defend Harvard, we will continue to: nurture a thriving culture of open inquiry on our campus; develop the tools, skills, and practices needed to engage constructively with one another; and broaden the intellectual and viewpoint diversity within our community; affirm the rights and responsibilities we share; respect free speech and dissent while also ensuring that protest occurs in a time, place, and manner that does not interfere with teaching, learning, and research; and enhance the consistency and fairness of disciplinary processes; and work together to find ways, consistent with law, to foster and support a vibrant community that exemplifies, respects, and embraces difference. As we do, we will also continue to comply with Students For Fair Admissions v. Harvard, which ruled that Title VI of the Civil Rights Act makes it unlawful for universities to make decisions “on the basis of race.”

These ends will not be achieved by assertions of power, unmoored from the law, to control teaching and learning at Harvard and to dictate how we operate. The work of addressing our shortcomings, fulfilling our commitments, and embodying our values is ours to define and undertake as a community. Freedom of thought and inquiry, along with the government’s longstanding commitment to respect and protect it, has enabled universities to contribute in vital ways to a free society and to healthier, more prosperous lives for people everywhere. All of us share a stake in safeguarding that freedom. We proceed now, as always, with the conviction that the fearless and unfettered pursuit of truth liberates humanity—and with faith in the enduring promise that America’s colleges and universities hold for our country and our world.

The Trump administration on Monday froze $2.2 billion in grants and $6 million from contracts awarded to Harvard University after the university refused to comply with a series of policy changes proposed by the US President.The Ivy League institution was asked by the government to share its hiring data and to bring in an external party to ensure that each academic department is ""viewpoint diverse.The letter was followed by a detailed statement by the university, in which it acknowledged that while some of the administration's demands aim to combat antisemitism, the majority appear to be attempts to regulate the ""intellectual conditions"" at Harvard.","Harvard must make meaningful governance reform and restructuring to make possible major change consistent with this letter. The University must adopt and implement merit-based hiring policies, and cease all preferences based on race, color, national origin, or proxies thereof. All existing and prospective faculty shall be reviewed for plagiarism and Harvard’s plagiarism policy consistently enforced.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120297161,imgsize-1000511,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

Latest hearing in Tufts student Rumeysa Ozturk's ICE deportation case

Rumeysa Ozturk , a Turkish doctoral student at Tufts University, who was detained by US immigration authorities in March over ""antisemitism on campus"", has described the conditions in the detention facility as “inhumane” and “unsafe.”Rumeysa Ozturk, 30, was arrested by US immigration and customs enforcement (ICE) agents near her home in Somerville, Massachusetts, on March 25. She was walking to meet friends to break her Ramadan fast when masked officers surrounded her. “I was speaking to my mother on the phone when several men approached me on the street and then surrounded me and I screamed,” she said in court filings, according to USA today.Ozturk was taken without being allowed to call her lawyer. “They didn’t let me make any calls, and they asked me to put the phone into flight mode,” she said. “It was an isolated place with four men, and it was terrifying.”Initially held in Vermont, Ozturk was transferred to a facility in Pine Prairie, Louisiana, against a judge’s order. There, she says conditions have been unbearable. “The conditions in the facility are very unsanitary, unsafe, and inhumane,” she said. “There is a mouse in our cell... They don’t give us adequate hygiene supplies.”She also accused a nurse of forcibly removing her hijab. “She said, ‘You need to take that thing off your head’ and took off my hijab without asking my permission,” Ozturk said. She also reported asthma attacks and said medical staff offered little more than ibuprofen.The department of homeland security claims Ozturk supported Hamas, a designated terrorist group, and said this justified her detention. But she has not been formally charged.US district Judge William Sessions called her detention a “potential constitutional crisis” and questioned the legality of ICE’s actions. Ozturk says she only wants to return to her studies: “I pray every day for my release so I can go back to my home and community in Somerville.”Ozturk was one of four students who wrote an op-ed in the campus newspaper, The Tufts Daily, last year criticising the university’s response to student activists demanding that Tufts “acknowledge the Palestinian genocide,” disclose its investments and divest from companies with ties to Israel.","Rumeysa Ozturk, 30, was arrested by US immigration and customs enforcement (ICE) agents near her home in Somerville, Massachusetts, on March 25.

Combs, 55, appeared in Manhattan federal court to enter his plea, as prosecutors expand the case to now include five criminal counts in total—sex trafficking, racketeering, and prostitution-related charges among them.Prosecutors allege that over two decades, Combs ""abused, threatened, and coerced women and others around him to fulfill his sexual desires, protect his reputation and conceal his conduct."" They further claim he used his business empire and staff to build a criminal enterprise engaged in sex trafficking, forced labour, kidnapping, arson, bribery, and obstruction of justice.The Grammy-winning artist , long a prominent figure in the hip-hop world, is accused of organizing drug-fueled sex parties and using threats and violence to manipulate victims and silence employees. Combs has denied all charges, maintaining that “any sex acts were consensual.”Judge Arun Subramanian, who is overseeing the case, said during Monday’s hearing, “We are a freight train moving toward trial.” However, Combs’ attorney Marc Agnifilo indicated the defense may request a brief delay, citing the need to review new evidence including emails not previously submitted by a key witness. The judge gave the defense until Wednesday, April 16, to file a written request.The trial is scheduled to begin with jury selection on May 5, though the timeline may shift depending on the court’s decision regarding the delay.Combs has been incarcerated since September 2024, and his legal troubles have deepened amid a growing wave of civil lawsuits and public allegations.

US president Donald Trump blamed former president Joe Biden’s immigration policies for the 2023 murder of Maryland mother Rachel Morin.Trump on Monday in a social media post said, “Moments ago, the illegal criminal, who was allowed into our country by crooked Joe Biden, was convicted of the heinous murder of Rachel Morin. Rachel was a beautiful mother of five from Maryland, and her life was taken at the hands of a monster who should have never been here in the first place.""""The fake news should be focusing on the beautiful life and tragic death of this Maryland mother, rather than the so-called “Maryland father,” who is actually an MS-13 gang member and foreign terrorist from El Salvador.

Make America great again!"" he added.Martinez-Hernandez, who illegally entered the United States from El Salvador in 2023, was found guilty of first-degree premeditated murder, rape, and kidnapping.

Prosecutors confirmed his ties to criminal gangs and announced they will seek a life sentence without parole.This comes at a time when his administration is under fire for a separate case involving Salvadoran national Kilmar Abrego Garcia. Garcia, who had lived in the US since 2011, was deported by immigration and customs enforcement (ICE) in March despite a 2019 judge’s ruling that protected him from removal. The deportation was later declared illegal by US. courts.

Immigration agents detained Palestinian student Mohsen Mahdawi at a US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) office in Vermont on Monday, just as he arrived for his citizenship interview. Mahdawi, a Columbia University student and activist, was arrested after a decade-long stay in the US, where he had obtained a green card.He had been a vocal leader in the anti-Israel protests on Columbia’s campus, which likely drew the attention of the Trump administration's immigration enforcement efforts.In a video shared on social media, Mahdawi, hands shackled, is seen being escorted by federal agents to an unmarked vehicle. His attorney, Luna Droubi, called the arrest unlawful, stating, ""He came to this country hoping to be free to speak out about the atrocities he has witnessed, only to be punished for such speech.""Mahdawi, who led the Palestinian student union at Columbia, has been a target of criticism and scrutiny due to his pro-Palestinian activism. He told The Intercept, “It’s kind of a death sentence... because my people are being killed unjustly in an indiscriminate way.” He explained that his past activism, especially his role in protesting Israel’s actions in Gaza, had made him a target of immigration enforcement.Mahdawi had been hiding after his friend and fellow protester Mahmoud Khalil was detained by immigration authorities, fearing his own arrest. The USCIS had moved his citizenship interview from December to this week, which raised suspicions that the meeting was part of a setup. Mahdawi’s fears were realized when he was arrested as he attended the interview.His attorney filed a habeas corpus petition on his behalf, arguing that the government’s actions violated his due process rights. A federal judge has since issued a temporary restraining order, preventing Mahdawi from being moved out of Vermont while his case is pending.Mahdawi has expressed that he believes his deportation to the West Bank, where violence and unrest are escalating, would effectively be a ""death sentence.""

Bessent on Trade Talks, Powell Future, Argentina, Dollar

The White House is preparing to begin interviews for a new Federal Reserve Chair this autumn, as Jerome Powell , a Biden appointee's term ends in May 2026. Treasury secretary Scott Bessent confirmed to Bloomberg the timeline during a visit to Argentina, saying it gives the Trump administration a six-month window to plan ahead.The decision comes amid growing political pressure on the Federal Reserve. President Donald Trump has repeatedly urged the Fed to cut interest rates. On 4 April, he posted on Truth Social: “Cut interest rates, Jeroma, and stop playing politics”Despite the criticism, Bessent said there were no plans to remove Powell before his term ends. He also said the Fed’s independence is not under threat. However, Bessent did call for more conversation about the Fed’s regulatory role. “The Fed is one of three bank regulators—the other two being the Comptroller of the Currency and the FDIC,” he said. “It’s possible to separate monetary policy from regulatory policy.”He also noted there was no sign of panic during his recent visit to the Fed. “It seems like business as usual,” he added.Powell had warned that Trump's new tariffs could lead to slower growth and higher inflation. Speaking in Virginia last week, he said the economy faces “elevated risks” of both rising joblessness and price pressures—challenges that could complicate any decision by his eventual successor.""We face a highly uncertain outlook with elevated risks of both higher unemployment and higher inflation,"" he said, undermining both of the Fed's mandates of 2% inflation and maximum employment.",The White House is preparing to begin interviews for a new Federal Reserve Chair this autumn.

What is the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia?



Why Garcia won't return to the US



The White House meeting between President Donald Trump and El Salvador president Nayib Bukele Monday made one thing clear that Maryland man Kilmar Abrego Garcia who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador won't be returned to the US. After this hit the headlines and the Trump administration had to face brickbats for it, the White House slammed the media and said describing Kilmar as a Maryland man is wrong as he is an illegal immigrant.On March 12 this year, Garcia, a Salvadoran citizen but who was living in the US for the past 14 years, was detained by ICE and was deported to El Salvador as the Trump administration identified him as a gang member of MS-13. Garcia arrived in the US illegally in 2011 as he fled persecution by gangs. An immigration judge ruled in 2019 that he couldn't be deported because of the risk of gang-related persecution.As the case reached the court after he was deported, the court said there was not adequate evidence to prove that he was a member of MS-13. The Trump administration labeled the deportation an “administrative error”. U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis ruled on April 4, 2025, that his deportation was illegal and ordered his return, calling the action “wholly lawless.” The Supreme Court upheld this on April 10, 2025, directing the government to “facilitate” his return.Attorney General Pam Bondi said US would send a plane to El Salvador to take Garcia if El Salvador releases him from the prison. “Additional paperwork had needed to be done. That’s up to El Salvador if they want to return him. That’s not up to us. The Supreme Court ruled that if El Salvador wants to return him … we would facilitate it: meaning, provide a plane,” Bondi said in front of Trump and Bukele.Nayib Bukele said it was a preposterous idea to release a prisoner. He also said he does not have the right to release a prisoner and then sneak him back to the United States. “I hope you’re not suggesting that I smuggle a terrorist into the United States,” Bukele said. “How can I smuggle a terrorist into the United States? Of course I’m not going to do it. The question is preposterous.”","Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran citizen, was deported to El Salvador on March 12 this year.

President Donald Trump has signalled that he will announce further tariffs this week on semiconductors. The move would raise the cost of importing chips, which are a vital component in electronics, cars, toys and other goods. Speaking Sunday night from Air Force One , the president said tariffs on electronics would ""be announced very soon,"" but suggested there might be room for exemptions. ""I'm a very flexible person...,"" Trump said on Monday, when asked about possible exemptions. He added he had spoken to Apple CEO Tim Cook and ""helped"" him recently.","US President Donald Trump has signalled that he will announce further tariffs this week on semiconductors.

Baloch separatists kill 8 Pakistanis in Iran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/baloch-separatists-kill-8-pakistanis-in-iran/articleshow/120262403.cms,"ISLAMABAD:

Eight Pakistani car mechanics were shot dead in Iran late Saturday, sparking outrage and deepening fears that the country was becoming a hub for anti-Pakistan militants after Afghanistan.Balochistan National Army (BNA), a lesser-known separatist group, claimed responsibility for the attack in Sistan-Baluchestan province, escalating tensions between the neighbouring countries as Pakistan demanded swift action. The eight workers hailed from Punjab -- Pakistan’s most populous province -- and were killed at a workshop in Mehrestan district, near Afghanistan’s border, Pakistani authorities said.BNA framed the killings as retaliation against perceived Punjabi dominance in Balochistan’s economic and political spheres. “We will not allow outsiders to exploit our land and resources,” BNA said in an online statement, echoing long-standing Baloch grievances over resource exploitation and marginalisation. The outfit has aligned itself with the broader Baloch insurgency led by groups like Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA).Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif called the attack “barbaric”. “We demand the perpetrators be brought to justice swiftly,” he said, urging Tehran to act. Sharif ordered the foreign ministry to help the victims’ families and repatriate the bodies. Foreign minister Ishaq Dar issued a similar condemnation. “This attack challenges our sovereignty. We cannot allow our citizens to be targeted abroad,” Dar said.Iran’s response was measured but conspicuously vague. Ambassador Reza Amiri Moghadam condemned the killings as “inhumane and cowardly”, calling terrorism a “chronic plight” that demands regional cooperation. Yet, Tehran offered no concrete assurances of cracking down on groups like BNA, prompting scepticism in Islamabad.Thousands of Pakistanis, particularly from economically deprived areas, travel to Iran on a regular basis to take up informal jobs in sectors such as vehicle repairs, construction, and agriculture.In Jan 2024, nine Pakistani labourers were killed and three critically injured in a similar attack in Saravancity, also located in Iran’s southeastern border region. Like in the latest killings, the victims in that case worked in an automobile repair shop. These murders occurred at a time when Pakistan and Iran were attempting to repair diplomatic relations after tit-for-tat missile and drone attacks.","Balochistan National Army (BNA), a lesser-known separatist group, claimed responsibility for the attack.

Poll Do you believe that Pakistan is adequately prepared for earthquakes? No Yes

A moderate-intensity earthquake with a magnitude of 5.8 struck Pakistan at around 1 pm on Saturday, with tremors felt in Jammu and Kashmir.Tremors were felt across many parts of the Valley, but there were no immediate reports of casualties or property damage. The earthquake occurred at a depth of 10 kilometres, with coordinates of 33.63 degrees North latitude and 72.46 degrees East longitude.According to the National Center for Seismology (NCS), the recent earthquake struck at a shallow depth of 10km, increasing the likelihood of aftershocks.Shallow earthquakes are typically more dangerous than deeper ones because the seismic waves travel a shorter distance to the surface, causing stronger ground shaking and potentially more damage to structures and higher casualties.Pakistan, located on the boundary of the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates, is one of the most seismically active countries. The nation frequently experiences destructive earthquakes due to its position on major fault lines. Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, and Gilgit-Baltistan lie on the southern edge of the Eurasian plate, while Sindh, Punjab, and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir are on the north-western edge of the Indian plate. The collision of these plates makes the region highly susceptible to violent earthquakes.Earlier, Pakistan’s neighbor Tajikistan was also jolted by a 4.2 magnitude earthquake.","A moderate-intensity earthquake with a magnitude of 5.8 struck Pakistan at around 1 pm on Saturday, with tremors felt in Jammu and Kashmir.

Poll Should the Pakistani military have a role in politics? No, it undermines democracy. Yes, they provide stability.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s political landscape remains a battleground of competing forces, with the military, former prime minister Imran Khan, and the current govt under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif locked in a tense struggle.The interplay of US foreign policy and the Pakistani diaspora’s growing voice adds further complexity to a nation grappling with economic woes, security threats and democratic erosion.Imran Khan, ousted in April 2022 via a no-confidence vote, continues to challenge the status quo from behind bars. Convicted on corruption and state secret charges, the cricketer-turned-politician retains a fervent base, accusing the military and Sharif’s govt of colluding with the US to orchestrate his downfall.Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) alleges widespread rigging in the Feb 2024 elections, which saw Sharif’s Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) secure power through a fragile coalition. PTI supporters, galvanised by Khan’s claims, have staged protests, clashing with the security forces and deepening the political divide.The military, longtime kingmaker in Pakistani politics, appears to have shifted allegiance. Once Khan’s backer in his 2018 rise, the army soured on him after policy disputes and his public criticisms of General Asim Munir, the current army chief.Analysts suggest the military now props up Sharif’s govt, a dynamic evident in legislative moves like the 2023 Pakistan Army Act amendment, which stifled dissent and empowered the armed forces. This hybrid regime – blending electoral democracy with military influence – has drawn scrutiny for undermining constitutional norms, yet the generals show no sign of relinquishing their grip.However, Shehbaz Sharif, re-elected in March 2024 as PM, faces a legitimacy crisis. His coalition, including the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) and other smaller factions, struggles to address surging militant attacks, crumbling infrastructure, and an economy reliant on IMF bailouts.Sharif vows to mend ties with Washington but his govt’s dependence on military support raises questions about its autonomy. Khan’s call for an election audit, echoed in a letter to the IMF, threatens to derail these efforts as Pakistan awaits a critical loan installment.The US role remains contentious. Khan’s unproven claims of a Washington-led conspiracy resonate with a populace wary of foreign interference, a sentiment rooted in decades of strained relations. The Biden administration, while engaging Sharif’s govt, has maintained robust military ties with Pakistan, prioritising counter-terrorism over democratic concerns. This ambivalence has fuelled Khan’s narrative, even as US officials dismiss his allegations.Meanwhile, the Pakistani diaspora, particularly in the US, has emerged as a vocal force. Pro-democracy activists, many aligned with PTI, have lobbied Congress, securing bipartisan support for resolutions condemning elections irregularities and Khan’s detention. Over 100 lawmakers have urged his release, while some advocate sanctions against military leaders like Munir. This diaspora-driven pressure marks a shift, challenging the traditional US-Pakistan security nexus.As Pakistan teeters between chaos and stability, the military’s shadow looms large, Khan’s defiance endures, and Sharif’s govt navigates a treacherous path. With the US and Pakistani diaspora adding external weight, the nation’s democratic future hangs in the balance.","Imran Khan, ousted in April 2022 via a no-confidence vote, continues to challenge the status quo from behind bars.

Poll Do you support the call for a long march by Sardar Akhtar Mengal? No, I do not support it. Yes, I support it.

ISLAMABAD: A tense standoff unfolded across Balochistan on Monday as a shutter-down strike and widespread road blockades sparked by nationalist leader Sardar Akhtar Mengal ’s call for a “long march” from Lakpass to Quetta paralysed the Pakistani province.The protest by Akhtar’s Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M), now in its second week, demands the release of detained Baloch activists, including women leaders of Balochistan Yakjehti Committee (BYC), amid escalating clashes with authorities.Shops businesses and schools remained closed in cities like Quetta, Kalat, Mastung Khuzdar, and Gwadar. Mengal’s supporters blocked key highways, including the Quetta-Karachi national highway.The provincial govt’s deployment of containers, trenches, and police checkpoints at Lakpass, roughly 30 km from Quetta, stalled the march, forcing demonstrators onto rugged mountain routes.Reports of police using teargas and shelling BNP-M workers have intensified the unrest.Mengal, addressing a sit-in at Lakpass, accused the state of oppression and vowed to press forward. “The state may crush us, but we won’t bow,” he declared, signalling plans to escalate the march into province-wide resistance. The protest began March 28 in Wadh, Mengal’s hometown, following the arrest of BYC leaders, including Mahrang Baloch, during a crackdown on their Quetta sit-in. A suicide bombing near the rally on March 29 left Mengal unharmed but underscored the volatile stakes.Balochistan’s govt, led by chief minister Sarfraz Bugti, has taken a hard line. His spokesperson, Shahid Rind, warned Mengal of arrest under the Maintenance of Public Order (MPO) Act if the march entered Quetta’s Red Zone.Negotiations have faltered, with Mengal dismissing the provincial govt’s delegations as powerless to meet demands. BYC, however, rallied behind Mengal, urging highway blockades and strikes to amplify pressure.Analysts see it as a critical juncture for Balochistan, where grievances over state repression, enforced disappearances and resource exploitation fuel dissent. The shutter-down has disrupted public life, with Quetta’s land links to 12 districts severed for over a week. With cellular networks down and security tightened, the province braces for what Mengal’s supporters call a defining fight.","The protest by Akhtar’s Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M), now in its second week, demands the release of detained Baloch activists.

Harvest seasons multiply

HUSSAINABAD: At the foot of Pakistan's impossibly high mountains whitened by frost all year round, farmers grappling with a lack of water have created their own ice towers.Warmer winters as a result of climate change has reduced the snow fall and subsequent seasonal snowmelt that feeds the valleys of Gilgit-Baltistan, a remote region home to K2, the world's second-highest peak.Farmers in the Skardu valley, at an altitude of up to 2,600 metres (8,200 feet) in the shadow of the Karakoram mountain range, searched online for help in how to irrigate their apple and apricot orchards.""We discovered artificial glaciers on YouTube,"" Ghulam Haider Hashmi told AFP.They watched the videos of Sonam Wangchuk , an environmental activist and engineer in the Indian region of Ladakh, less than 200 kilometres away across a heavily patrolled border, who developed the technique about 10 years ago.Water is piped from streams into the village, and sprayed into the air during the freezing winter temperatures.""The water must be propelled so that it freezes in the air when temperatures drop below zero, creating ice towers,"" said Zakir Hussain Zakir, a professor at the University of Baltistan.The ice forms in the shape of cones that resemble Buddhist stupas, and act as a storage system -- steadily melting throughout spring when temperatures rise.Gilgit-Baltistan has 13,000 glaciers -- more than any other country on Earth outside the polar regions.Their beauty has made the region one of the country's top tourist destinations -- towering peaks loom over the Old Silk Road, still visible from a highway transporting tourists between cherry orchards, glaciers and ice-blue lakes.Sher Muhammad, a specialist in the Hindu Kush-Himalayan mountain range that stretches from Afghanistan to Myanmar, however said most of the region's water supply comes from snow melt in spring, with a fraction from annual glacial melt in summers.""From late October until early April, we were receiving heavy snowfall. But in the past few years, it's quite dry,"" Muhammad, a researcher at the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), told AFP.The first ""ice stupas"" in Gilgit-Baltistan were created in 2018.Now, more than 20 villages make them every winter, and ""more than 16,000 residents have access to water without having to build reservoirs or tanks"", said Rashid-ud-Din, provincial head of GLOF-2, a UN-Pakistan plan to adapt to the effects of climate change.Farmer Muhammad Raza told AFP that eight stupas were built in his village of Hussainabad this winter, trapping approximately 20 million litres of water in the ice.""We no longer have water shortages during planting,"" he said, since the open-air reservoirs appeared on the slopes of the valley.""Before, we had to wait for the glaciers to melt in June to get water, but the stupas saved our fields,"" said Ali Kazim, also a farmer in the valley.Before the stupas, ""we planted our crops in May"", said 26-year-old Bashir Ahmed who grows potatoes, wheat and barley in nearby Pari village which has also adopted the method.And ""we only had one growing season, whereas now we can plant two or three times"" a year.Temperatures in Pakistan rose twice as fast between 1981 and 2005 compared to the global average, putting the country on the front line of climate change impacts, including water scarcity.Its 240 million inhabitants live in a territory that is 80 percent arid or semi-arid and depends on rivers and streams originating in neighbouring countries for more than three-quarters of its water.Glaciers are melting rapidly in Pakistan and across the world, with a few exceptions including the Karakoram mountain range, increasing the risk of flooding and reducing water supply over the long term.""Faced with climate change, there are neither rich nor poor, neither urban nor rural; the whole world has become vulnerable,"" said 24-year-old Yasir Parvi.""In our village, with the ice stupas, we decided to take a chance.""","Warmer winters as a result of climate change has reduced the snow fall and subsequent seasonal snowmelt that feeds the valleys of Gilgit-Baltistan. More than 20 villages make the ice stupas every winter, which provides 16,000 residents access to water.

Which are the most affected regions?



What are the consequences of the rising violence?



More than 100 deadly attacks in Pakistan by Islamist militants and separatist rebels made March the deadliest month over a decade with 335 people killed, a think tank reported Thursday.Of the deaths, 228 were caused by militant groups, according to a report by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) think tank. They included 73 members of security services, including soldiers and police officers, 67 civilians and 88 militants.The Islamist-militant Pakistani Taliban, or Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), and the separatist rebel Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) were the main militant groups responsible for the attacks.The BLA was responsible for a 28-hour hijacking of the train Jaffar Express in the southwestern region Balochistan. Some 450 people were held hostage and more than two dozen were killed.Balochistan was the most affected province, followed by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in the northwest of Pakistan.They have both also been targets of suicide bombings, a form of attacks that surged in March.In Punjab, the eastern province bordering India, the think tank observed a strong increase in militant activity.At least seven attacks were recorded, and most were attributed to the TTP.In response to the growing threat, Pakistan's security forces have intensified their operations in the region. Many people have been arrested with connections to militant groups, including the TTP.Islamabad claims that most attacks, both by militants and rebels, are planned and executed from Afghanistan. It accuses the neighboring country of granting Pakistani militants space to plan and organize attacks.A recent report by the United Nations supported this claim.

He maintains his innocence, asserting that the charges are politically driven.","Imran Khan has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for his contributions to human rights and democratic values.

DHAKA: Bengali new year celebrations in Chittagong's DC Hill area were abruptly cancelled after unidentified individuals vandalised banners, festoons, and side stages set up for Monday's event. This marks the first time in 47 years that the event - Poila Boishakh - was not held at DC Hill due to such disruption.According to witnesses, a group of 30-40 people arrived in a procession on Sunday evening, chanting slogans like ""accomplices of fascists, beware!"" and ""agents of Awami League, beware!""They then destroyed parts of the venue. Organisers then suspended all scheduled programme in protest. Event coordinator Sucharit Das Khokon said organisers faced several challenges over the past two days while preparing for the celebrations. ""At the last moment, the district administration gave us a list of 23 organisations, instructing us not to allow them to perform. And then, just before the event, this act of vandalism took place,"" he said.Chief adviser Muhammad Yunus, on the occassion, urged citizens to unite in building a peaceful, inclusive and prosperous Bangladesh. ""Let building a Bangladesh without discrimination be our commitment in this Bangla New Year,"" he said in a message.Meanwhile, ousted PM Sheikh Hasina slammed the Yunus govt over the incident. ""Today, anti-liberation forces have illegally seized power in Bangladesh. They are actively trying to destroy Bengali culture,"" she said in a statement. ""Whenever anti-independence forces gained control in the past, they attacked the nation's history, heritage, and culture. They not only tried to stop the Mangal Shobhajatra but even attempted to change its name,"" she added. ""On this auspicious moment of Bengali New Year, let us commit to rejecting all that is unhealthy, ugly, or part of a distorted culture - and instead, embrace a healthy, beautiful, and creative way of life,"" Hasina said.This year, govt renamed the traditional 'Mangal Shobhajatra' procession, a central attraction of Poila Boishakh celebrations, as 'Anondo Shobhajatra' after conservative Islamist groups like Hefazat-e-Islam called the 'Mangal Shobhajatra' a ""Hindu ritual"" and urged govt to change its name.","Bengali new year celebrations in Chittagong's DC Hill area were abruptly cancelled.

Poll Do you support the Indian Vegetable Oil Producers' Association's call to restrict duty-free edible oil imports from Nepal? No, free trade should be prioritized Yes, to protect domestic processors

NEW DELHI: The Indian Vegetable Oil Producers' Association (IVPA) called on the government on Monday to restrict the sharp increase in duty-free edible oil imports from Nepal under South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA) provisions to protect domestic processors. Imports from Nepal surged to 1,80,000 tonnes in January-March 2025, exceeding the 1,25,000 tonnes recorded throughout 2024, IVPA said in a statement.The industry body noted that most of 2024's imports arrived during October-December following India's duty hikes, suggesting potential third-country routing through Nepal.""This growth, which is not backed by Nepal's own oilseed production capacity, raises serious questions around the effective enforcement of Rules of Origin,"" the association said.The influx of duty-free imports has created an uneven playing field for Indian processors and weakened market sentiment, causing farmers to receive prices ""significantly below"" the minimum support price, IVPA added.The organisation has submitted recommendations to the ministries aimed at ensuring SAFTA provisions are implemented properly while supporting the country's agricultural interests.","The Indian Vegetable Oil Producers' Association (IVPA) called on the government on Monday to restrict the sharp increase in duty-free edible oil imports from Nepal.

Earlier this month, the home ministry issued a notification regarding the change.Bangladeshi passports used to have ""this passport is valid for all countries of the world except Israel"" inscribed on them. The phrase was dropped in 2021.

Bangladesh on Sunday issued an arrest warren against British MP Tulip Siddiq over allegations linked to a widening corruption probe involving her aunt, the ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina The warrant issued by the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC), accuses Siddiq of unlawfully acquiring land through political influence , The Financial Times reported.The Hampstead and Highgate MP is among more than 50 individuals named in connection with the investigation, which centres on alleged misuse of state property during Hasina’s regime, removed from power last August after mass protests.The ACC claims Siddiq and her family received a 7,200 sq ft plot in Dhaka’s diplomatic zone and were involved in securing multiple land allocations via Hasina’s government. The case also includes allegations related to a 2013 nuclear power deal with Russia, where Siddiq is accused of helping inflate the project cost, reported BBC.Siddiq has strongly denied any wrongdoing. In a statement via her lawyers at Stephenson Harwood , she said she has ""never had a plot of land in Bangladesh"" and ""has never influenced any allocation of plots of land to her family members or anyone else.""Her legal team insisted the charges are “completely false” and “politically motivated”, adding that neither Siddiq nor her lawyers had been contacted formally by the ACC or informed of any hearing or warrant.The warrant reportedly stems from her non-attendance at a Dhaka court hearing earlier this week, as per the Financial Times. Her legal representatives argue she had no knowledge of the hearing or prior summons.Siddiq resigned in January as city minister following scrutiny over her ties to the Hasina regime.The accusations have ignited political backlash in the UK. A Conservative Party spokesperson said, “If it is the case that Keir Starmer’s choice for anti-corruption minister is the subject of an international arrest warrant for corruption, she should immediately stand down as Labour MP.” The party also criticised Starmer’s reported openness to her returning to government, according to The Guardian.Siddiq has maintained she is being targeted as part of a broader political campaign against Hasina's family. ACC chair Mohammad Abdul Momen rejected these claims, was quoted by BBC that the investigation is based on “documentary evidence” and that Siddiq “must not shy away from the court proceedings.”Bangladesh does not have a formal extradition treaty with the UK, though it is listed as a 2B extradition country, meaning clear evidence must be shown for any legal action to proceed.","Bangladesh issues an arrest warrant against British MP Tulip Siddiq.

Why is it being reintroduced?

Bangladesh's interim government announced on Sunday it has reintroduced the ""except Israel"" inscription on the country's passports, formally debarring its citizens from travelling to the Jewish state.“We issued the letter to the passport and immigration department on April 7,” Nilima Afroze, deputy secretary of the Bangladesh home ministry, told the state-run Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha (BSS) news agency.The statement ""THIS PASSPORT IS VALID FOR ALL COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD EXCEPT ISRAEL"" was dropped from the official travel documents in May 2021 during the tenure of the Awami League government of then-Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. In August last year, the government collapsed after Hasina resigned and came to India following weeks of student-led protests against her.The caretaker administration led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus took charge on August 8, three days after Hasina's ouster.According to BSS, the authorities at the time had said the purpose was to ""maintain international standards of the document"" and maintained there would be ""no change"" to Dhaka's decades-long policy of travel ban to Israel.However, after the text was removed, Bangladeshi nationals were allowed travel to Israel from a third country if they could obtain a visa.The two nations do not have diplomatic ties. Dhaka supports an independent Palestine.The inscription has been brought back at a time when there is widespread anger in India's eastern neighbour over Israel's military offensive in Palestine's Gaza Strip.On Saturday, thousands of protesters rallied in the capital Dhaka with Palestinian flags and chanted slogans like ""Free, Free Palestine.""The main protest was held at the Suhrawardy Udyan near the premier Dhaka University. Several protesters ""beat"" the images of US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.The Bangladesh Nationalist Party of former prime minister Khaleda Zia, as well as Islamic groups and other political parties expressed solidarity with the rally.","Bangladesh's interim government has reintroduced the ""except Israel"" inscription on the country's passports.

Rights groups and the U.N. condemned the killings.Taliban leader Hibatullah Akhundzada has previously rejected the need for Western laws in Afghanistan.In an audio clip released Sunday by the Taliban's chief spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid on X, Akhundzada said: ""We must carry out disciplinary measures, perform prayers and acts of worship. We must enter Islam completely. Islam is not just limited to a few rituals; it is a comprehensive system of all divine commands.""Not a single command of Islam should be left unfulfilled, he told a seminar of Hajj instructors during a 45-minute speech in southern Kandahar province.God had commanded people to pray and to enforce his punishments, said Akhundzada, adding that the Taliban did not wage war for power or wealth but rather to ""implement Islamic law "". He rejected criticism of the executions.Afghanistan's Supreme Court earlier ruled that the four men were guilty of murder. A death sentence was handed down after families of the alleged victims refused to grant the men amnesty.Akhundzada's comments come as the Taliban seek greater engagement with the international community, most recently the West.The United States last month lifted bounties on three senior Taliban figures, including the interior minister who also heads a powerful network blamed for bloody attacks against Afghanistan's former Western-backed government.The Taliban have freed four Americans from custody this year, describing these releases as the ""normalization"" of ties between the U.S. and Afghanistan.","Taliban leader Hibatullah Akhundzada has previously rejected the need for Western laws in Afghanistan.

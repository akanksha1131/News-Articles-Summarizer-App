FAQs

Q1. Who will run the new airline in Saudi Arabia?

Q2. Why was Dammam chosen as the base?

Q3. How will this airline be different from others like Flyadeal or Riyadh Air?





On July 20, 2025, Saudi Arabia’s General Authority of Civil Aviation (GACA) announced that an alliance led by Air Arabia, along with Saudi firms Kun Investment Holding and Nesma Group, has secured the license to operate a new national low-cost airline based at King Fahd International Airport in Dammam.This new airline will launch with a fleet of 45 aircraft, connecting 24 cities across Saudi Arabia and flying to 57 international destinations. By 2030, the carrier aims to serve around 10 million passengers each year and create over 2,400 new jobs.According to Saudi officials, the airline will help boost competition, increase seat capacity, and offer more affordable travel options to the public, especially in the country’s Eastern Region.Air Arabia is a low-cost airline based in Sharjah, UAE. Launched in 2003, it was the first budget carrier in the Middle East. Today, it operates a fleet of about 60 Airbus A320s and flies to over 170 destinations across 30+ countries, including cities in the Middle East, North Africa, Asia, and Europe. The airline is known for offering affordable fares and simple, no-frills service.Until now, Air Arabia’s presence in Saudi Arabia was limited to international flights, connecting cities like Riyadh, Jeddah, and Dammam to its wider network.Dammam, for example, was just a destination.That’s changing. With the launch of the new Saudi low-cost airline, Dammam becomes the airline’s home base in the Kingdom. This is the first time Air Arabia is co-operating a Saudi-licensed carrier, and it turns Dammam into a full-fledged hub, not just a stop on a route. For travelers in the Eastern Province, it means more direct flights, better access, and lower fares.The license was awarded to a three-member consortium:Unlike foreign players operating independently in Saudi skies, this is a Saudi-licensed airline backed by a regional partnership, blending international experience with local roots.Dammam hasn’t traditionally been the center of Saudi aviation. Most growth has centered on Riyadh and Jeddah. This move signals a change. By basing the new airline in Dammam, the alliance is tapping into a region that’s economically vital but often underserved by direct air links. The plan includes:This also helps reduce pressure on larger airports and supports Saudi Arabia’s goal of creating multiple air travel hubs, not just one or two dominant centers.Saudi Arabia is betting big on aviation as part of Vision 2030, its long-term strategy to diversify the economy beyond oil. The country aims to:This new airline aligns with that effort. It’s not meant to compete with flagship brands like Riyadh Air, which focuses on premium long-haul routes. Instead, it adds depth, filling a gap in affordable, short- and mid-range travel and extending access to more travelers.Officials from Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Transport and Logistic Services have indicated that the new airline is expected to increase market competition and offer travelers more choices, supporting the country’s broader aviation strategy.The airline will be operated by an alliance led by UAE’s Air Arabia, with Saudi-based Kun Investment Holding and Nesma Group as partners. The license was granted by GACA.Dammam offers untapped potential. It’s a growing economic region with room to expand air traffic. Placing the airline there supports regional development and eases pressure on Riyadh and Jeddah.Flyadeal focuses on domestic routes under Saudia. Riyadh Air targets long-haul premium travel.

is rooted in presence, not performance. Each meeting, whether with students or workers, shows consistency, humility, and care.

1. Top Students Met a President And Felt Like They Met a Father

2. A Hug at a Sports Festival Not Just for the Cameras

3. No Guards, No Motorcade, Just a Walk in the City

4. At a Power Plant, a Quiet Thank You to Workers



5. Recognizing Foster Mothers for What Truly Counts



FAQs

Q1. Why does Sheikh Mohamed keep making these personal visits?

Q2. Are these visits planned for publicity?

Q3. What do people feel after meeting him?





Some leaders lead from a distance. Others choose to stay close. Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the President of the UAE, is clearly the second kind. His schedule is full, meetings, official visits, national responsibilities, but somehow, he keeps making space for people. Not in grand ceremonies, but in small, real ways. He’s seen walking the streets of Abu Dhabi without bodyguards. Hugging athletes at local events. Sitting with nuclear plant workers. Or quietly thanking foster mothers for doing what matters most.None of this is by accident. It’s a pattern. One that’s become central to how he leads. Presence, humility, and human connection are not occasional, they’re consistent. And over time, this steady, quiet approach has reshaped how people across the UAE view their leadership: not as distant authority, but as someone who listens and never forgets who he’s leading.Here are just a few moments that show why Sheikh Mohamed is often called the people’s leader, quiet, consistent, and deeply committed to the nation and its people.Just hours after final exam results were announced, a group of top students in the UAE found themselves in a room with Sheikh Mohamed. But it didn’t feel like a formal event. It felt personal. The student felt like they were meeting a father, not a head of stateThere were no long speeches.He didn’t just shake hands and leave. He took time to listen. To talk to them like someone who understands how hard they worked. He made them feel proud, but also reminded them to stay grounded. The message was simple: your effort matters, and you matter.At the Abu Dhabi Summer Sports Festival, Sheikh Mohamed didn’t show up as a guest of honor. He showed up as a supporter. He walked through the event like anyone else, greeting athletes, coaches, and even visitors in the crowd. There were hugs, smiles, and quiet conversations.It didn’t feel planned or polished. That’s what made it real. He didn’t need to give a speech to show encouragement. Just showing up was enough and that’s what people remember. A leader who looks you in the eye, not from a stage, but from the sidelines.A video recently went viral online. In it, Sheikh Mohamed is walking down a street in Abu Dhabi, no security, no blocked roads, no special treatment. Just him, talking with a few people like any other resident.In most countries, this wouldn’t happen. Leaders are usually behind barriers, surrounded by layers of protocol. But here, it sends a different message. That trust goes both ways and that safety isn’t just about fences or guards. It’s about a sense of belonging. It’s about knowing your leader walks the same streets you do.When the UAE marked the completion of Unit 3 at the Barakah Nuclear Power Plant, most expected the usual formalities. But the most meaningful moment wasn’t part of the ceremony. It was a quick, unscripted chat between Sheikh Mohamed and a small group of workers.They were standing casually, in a loose circle. Talking, laughing, thanking each other. No media glare, no big headlines. Just recognition, the kind that sticks. These workers are the backbone of major national projects, and Sheikh Mohamed made sure they knew he saw them, not just the results.There are many ways to lead. One of them is by showing gratitude to those doing quiet, important work. That’s what happened when Sheikh Mohamed met with a group of foster mothers caring for children without families.He didn’t rush through the meeting. He shook hands. He listened. He thanked each one for giving kids a stable, loving home. There was no ceremony, just sincerity. And for the mothers, that meant more than any award. It was a rare kind of leadership: one that honors care, compassion, and the invisible strength holding communities together.Because he believes real leadership happens on the ground. These aren’t just appearances, they’re a way of staying connected to the people and their everyday lives.Not really. Many of them aren’t announced ahead of time, and often go unnoticed until someone shares a moment online. They seem to come from a place of genuine intention, not public image.Most describe it as surprising and deeply moving. It makes them feel seen. And it reminds them that their leader isn’t far away, he’s right here with them.","Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan is often called the people’s leader, quiet, consistent, and deeply committed to the nation and its people.

A 65-year-old grandmother masterminded one of UK’s most sophisticated drug trafficking operations, has been sentenced to 20 years in prison. Deborah Mason, infamously nicknamed the “Queen Bee” and “Gangster Granny,” ran a sprawling family-led drugs cartel that trafficked more than a ton of cocaine worth up to £80 million across the country.Mason and seven of her relatives, including her sister and children, operated the high-level narcotics ring over a seven-month period from April to November 2023, reported. On Friday, she was sentenced in a London courtroom alongside other key members of the syndicate.The court heard that Mason’s gang used a network of couriers to transport massive quantities of imported cocaine. The drugs were distributed from London to several major cities including Bradford, Leicester, Birmingham, Bristol, and Cardiff.The cartel’s value of cocaine ranged between £23 million and £35 million, while its street value was estimated at a whopping £80 million. Despite the scale of the operation, prosecutors noted that Mason’s relatives were not coerced into joining the syndicate, but were instead ""motivated by financial benefit.""Mason’s 29-year-old daughter, Roseanne Mason, played a crucial role in the cartel's logistics. She was responsible for managing collections of the drug shipments.In a show of how deeply involved the family was, Roseanne even babysat the children of other couriers so they could continue working uninterrupted. She was sentenced to 11 years in prison for her part in the operation.Other members of the gang received lengthy prison terms as well, with sentences ranging from 13 to 15 years based on their individual roles in the criminal enterprise.The Metropolitan Police launched a thorough investigation into the drug ring, employing a range of surveillance tactics, including analysis of extensive call data and physical tracking of suspects.

Owning a car in Dubai has always been a symbol of status and convenience, but for many residents, especially expats with short- to medium-term plans in the UAE, leasing offers a smarter and more flexible alternative. In 2025, as the city's population continues to diversify and commute preferences evolve, leasing options have become more accessible, diverse, and financially appealing. Car leasing not only allows residents to access the latest models without a hefty down payment but also provides a worry-free experience with inclusive maintenance and insurance coverage. This guide walks you through the comprehensive process of leasing a car in Dubai, what to expect, the documents required, and how to choose the right leasing plan based on your needs.The UAE's dynamic job market, especially in cities like Dubai and Abu Dhabi, means that many residents are on short-term contracts or are uncertain about their long-term stay. Buying a car, while giving ownership, involves high upfront costs, insurance, maintenance, and depreciation risks. Leasing, by contrast, offers a predictable monthly expense without the burdens of ownership.Leasing companies in Dubai typically bundle costs like insurance, maintenance, servicing, and registration renewal into the monthly payment.This simplifies budgeting and provides peace of mind, especially for expats who prefer financial predictability. Furthermore, leasing allows residents to drive newer models more frequently, as contracts can range between one to five years, with options to upgrade once the lease term ends.There are several leasing structures available, tailored to different needs and financial profiles. The most common is the traditional leasing model, where you lease a car for a fixed period, generally between 12 and 60 months, after which the car is returned to the leasing company.Another increasingly popular model is the lease-to-own option. In this arrangement, a portion of the monthly lease payment contributes towards eventual ownership of the vehicle. Once the lease period ends, the customer can purchase the car by paying a pre-agreed residual value. Companies like Carlease Dubai specialize in such agreements, providing flexibility for residents who may want to keep the car long-term without committing upfront.Additionally, some companies offer no-deposit leases, which allow customers to lease a vehicle without placing a substantial security deposit. However, these plans typically have higher monthly payments and may include stricter mileage limits or fewer model options.Leasing costs in Dubai vary significantly depending on the car category, lease term, and inclusions in the contract. As of July 2025, economy cars such as the Nissan Sunny or Toyota Yaris typically start at around AED 1,200 to AED 1,600 per month for a 12-month lease. Mid-range SUVs like the Hyundai Tucson or Kia Sportage can range from AED 2,500 to AED 4,000 per month.Luxury vehicles, including brands like BMW, Mercedes-Benz, and Audi, can start from AED 3,000 and easily exceed AED 7,000 per month depending on specifications, insurance add-ons, and mileage limits.Providers such as Dirham Cars, Diamondlease, Hertz UAE, and LeasePlan offer competitive rates with full-service inclusions like insurance, scheduled maintenance, roadside assistance, and even replacement vehicles during service intervals.It's essential to read the contract carefully to understand what is covered in the lease payment. Some companies may exclude consumables like tires or offer insurance with deductibles that need to be paid in the event of an accident.Leasing a car in Dubai is a straightforward process, but applicants must provide certain documents to qualify:These requirements ensure that the lessee can maintain the monthly payments and that providers can mitigate financial risks.Before signing a leasing contract, it’s crucial to understand certain clauses that could affect the overall cost and experience:Reading the contract thoroughly and asking providers for clarification on these points can save unexpected costs and disputes later.The application process typically follows these steps:Several reputable companies offer leasing services in Dubai. Some of the prominent providers in 2025 include:These providers offer varied leasing options ranging from economy cars to high-end luxury models, with some also offering electric vehicle leases, reflecting the UAE’s push towards sustainable mobility.Leasing a car in Dubai in 2025 offers a practical alternative to buying, especially for expatriates and residents who prioritise flexibility, minimal commitment, and financial predictability. With a wide variety of providers, vehicle choices, and customizable plans, leasing can suit almost any budget or lifestyle need. Understanding the terms of the lease, comparing offers, and selecting a plan aligned with your driving habits and financial situation ensures that you can enjoy the benefits of car mobility in Dubai without the burdens of ownership.","Leasing a car in Dubai remains a cost-efficient option in 2025, particularly for expats and residents who seek flexibility, lower monthly costs, and minimal financial commitment compared to buying.

Trump’s Body Raising Red Flags? FIFA World Cup Photos Reveal POTUS’ ‘DISTURBING’ Condition





The White House Thursday announced that President Donald Trump has been diagnosed with a chronic but benign vein condition amid ongoing speculations over his bruised hand . The White House said the president sought a medical examination for swollen legs which came up with the new finding.""I know that many in the media have been speculating about bruising on the president's hand and also swelling in the president's legs. In the effort of transparency, the president wanted me to share a note from his physician ... all results were within normal limits,"" White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said.""Recent photos of the president have shown minor bruising on the back of his hand. This is consistent with minor soft tissue irritation from frequent hand-shaking and the use of aspirin,"" Leavitt said. Leavitt said Trump decided to share the note on his new health diagnosis with everyone. The president underwent a thorough evaluation after noticing swelling in his lower leg. The condition is benign and common among individuals over the age of 70. Leavitt announced that there is no evidence of deep vein thrombosis or arterial disease.Explaining the bruises on Trump's back of hand, Karoline explained that this is because of minor soft tissue irritation due to frequent hand shaking and the use of aspirin which Trump takes as part of standard cardiovascular prevention regimen.The clarification from the White House came as a close-up of Trump's hand became the center of online chatter as his hand looked evidently bruised. The theory of handshaking was floated earlier too but it was dismissed by many experts.Dr Neal H Patel, a doctor at Providence St Joseph Hospital, told the Daily Mail earlier this year that shaking hands is unlikely to have caused the damage. “I see a lot of patients who are businessmen, and I’ve never really seen them getting bruising from too much handshaking,” he said. “I guess it’s possible, but that would really not be on my list of ideas of what causes it.”",The White House said the president sought a medical examination for swollen legs which came up with the new finding.

Felix Baumgartner Dead At 56: Fearless Skydiving Legend Dies in Paragliding Crash | Watch





Austrian sportsman Felix Baumgartner, 56, also known as “fearless Felix” has lost his life in a paragliding accident in Italy, as per local media.Baumgartner reportedly was feeling unwell before takeoff and lost control of his aircraft on Thursday around 4.00 pm (local time) in Porto Sant'Elpidio, Marche. He reportedly crashed the craft into a hotel swimming pool, reports the New York Post.A woman was also injured in the incident after being hit by Baumgartner as he fell to the ground. She was transported to Murri Hospital, though initial reports indicate her injuries are not serious.Baumgartner departed from Fermo, but while flying along the coast, he lost control of the powered hang glider for reasons still under investigation. Following the crash, he lost consciousness and went into cardiac arrest, reports the Daily Mail.Emergency responders called for an air ambulance to transport him to the Torrette Hospital, in Ancona but he was pronounced dead at the scene.Around two hours before the deadly crash he posted a story on his Instagram that read “too much wind.”“Our community is deeply affected by the tragic disappearance of Felix Baumgartner, a figure of global prominence, a symbol of courage and passion for extreme flight,"" said the city's mayor Massimiliano Ciarpella, through a social media post.Baumgartner’s daring jump in 2012 from a capsule over 39 kilometres (24 miles) above Earth cemented his place in the record books as an extreme adventurer. Baumgartner achieved the fastest freefall on record, reaching a top speed of 1,357.6 kilometers (843.6 miles) per hour after jumping from the capsule, reports AFP.He set a world record in 1999 for the highest parachute jump from a building by leaping off the 1,483-foot-tall Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.He also became the first person to skydive across the English Channel in 2003.""I always had the desire to be in the air,"" Austrian media quoted him saying.

Clashes In US Senate; 'Are You Afraid Of Trump?': Lawmakers Walk Out Of 'Kangaroo Court' Hearing





• Donald Trump’s name appears seven times in Jeffrey Epstein’s flight logs from the 1990s.• The flights involved his then-wife Marla Maples, their daughter Tiffany, and staff.• There is no evidence Trump flew to Epstein’s private island or was involved in criminal activity.• Trump and Epstein were socially close in the ‘90s but reportedly fell out in the early 2000s.It’s a question that has lingered in the public consciousness ever since Jeffrey Epstein’s sordid crimes exploded into global headlines: Did Donald Trump ever fly on Epstein’s infamous “Lolita Express”?Thanks to a tranche of declassified documents released earlier this year by U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi—including the full flight logs from Epstein’s private jet—the answer is now clear. Yes, Trump was listed on at least seven flights aboard Epstein’s plane. But the logs also complicate some of the more salacious speculation that has dogged him for years.The logs tell a story—but not the whole oneAccording to flight manifests released in February 2025, Trump is recorded as a passenger on several domestic flights aboard Epstein’s plane in the early 1990s. Notably, these flights include family members: his then-wife Marla Maples, their young daughter Tiffany, and a nanny.There are no flights logged to Epstein’s notorious private island in the Virgin Islands (Little Saint James), nor are there entries connecting Trump to Epstein’s international sex trafficking operations.Still, these entries confirm what was long speculated: Trump and Epstein were socially close in the New York elite circles of the ‘90s, often appearing at the same parties and clubs. In a now-infamous 2002 quote to New York Magazine, Trump said: “I’ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy. He’s a lot of fun to be with... even said he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.”By the mid-2000s, however, Trump reportedly severed ties with Epstein. Multiple reports, including investigative timelines from Time and The New York Times, note a falling out—reportedly over a Florida real estate dispute. Trump has since claimed he banned Epstein from Mar-a-Lago, though the circumstances remain murky.During the 2016 and 2020 election cycles, Trump was repeatedly asked about Epstein. His campaign consistently maintained that he had no knowledge of Epstein’s crimes and was “one of the few” who had distanced himself from the financier early on. In 2019, after Epstein’s arrest, Trump told reporters, “I had a falling out with him a long time ago. I wasn’t a fan.”The declassified flight logs from 2025 have reignited public scrutiny, particularly on social media. But Trump’s 2024 re-election campaign—and now his second-term White House—have aggressively pushed back on suggestions of impropriety. His spokesperson Steven Cheung dismissed the log entries as “routine travel decades ago” and said Trump “never visited Epstein’s island, never engaged in any criminal behaviour, and never flew with Epstein after discovering what he was. ”However, critics say the presence of his name on the logs—even if innocent—adds to a pattern of proximity between Trump and men later convicted or accused of sex crimes, including Bill Cosby, R. Kelly, and Ghislaine Maxwell.To date, no criminal charges or credible allegations have tied Trump to Epstein’s sex trafficking operation. The released flight logs suggest a limited social association, concentrated in the early 1990s and mostly involving domestic flights with family. There is no indication of underage passengers accompanying Trump, no evidence of him visiting Little Saint James, and no direct link to the sexual abuse cases for which Epstein was convicted.Still, in a political environment dominated by conspiracy theories and mounting distrust in institutions, the optics are potent. Trump’s second term has already been marred by public anger over the abrupt firing of Maurene Comey, a federal prosecutor who worked on Epstein-linked cases, and speculation that the Trump administration is trying to control the narrative around Epstein’s death and files.Much like his presidency, Donald Trump’s connection to Jeffrey Epstein is a story with loud headlines and fine print. The records confirm they moved in the same elite circles. But as of now, the flight logs suggest association, not implication.A: Seven times, mostly in the early 1990s, including flights with Marla Maples and Tiffany Trump.A: No. There is no record of Trump flying to Little Saint James.A: Yes, they were socially close in the 1990s but reportedly fell out by the mid-2000s.A: No. He has not been charged or formally implicated in Epstein’s sex trafficking network.A: In 2025, Attorney General Pam Bondi released full Epstein flight logs as part of a broader declassification push, reigniting media interest.",Donald Trump's name appears seven times in Jeffrey Epstein's flight logs from the 1990s.

‘Most consequential 3 seconds’: Ex-Alaska Airlines pilot recalls attempting to shut off flight’s engine mid-air; feared fatal end,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/most-consequential-3-seconds-ex-alaska-airlines-pilot-recalls-attempting-to-shut-off-flights-engine-mid-air-feared-fatal-end/articleshow/122691296.cms,"ANI file photo





Former Alaska Airlines pilot Joseph Emerson, recalls the most “consequential three seconds” of his life when he had pulled down levers that could cut off fuel to the engines in an Alaska Air Flight 2059, reports CBS News. He had reportedly been under the influence of “magic mushrooms” and lost sense of reality.Emerson boarded the flight bound for San Francisco as a passenger from Everett, Washington with 83 other passengers and crew on board. He was assigned the cockpit jump seat located behind the pilot and first officer.""I had no intention of crashing an actual airplane. I wanted to wake up. I was convinced I wasn't going home to my wife and kids,"" he said in an interview with CBS News on Thursday.At that time he was grieving the death of his best friend and reportedly experimented with the psychedelic drug.""You're not going home. You need to wake up. That's when I acted. I pulled the handles that were in front of my face,"" he said recalling the incident. ""I mean, in the dream, in that dissociative state, I thought they were going to wake me up. It didn't wake me up, right? I was in reality. I know that now. You know, it's the most consequential three seconds of my life.”""I know what those levers do in a real airplane and I need to wake up from this. You know, it's 30 seconds of my life that I wish I could change, and I can't,” he was quoted saying by ABC News.The flight was diverted and landed safely in Portland, Oregon, where Emerson was taken into custody. He is scheduled to face trial next month on a federal charge of interfering with a flight crew, and also faces numerous state charges, including 83 misdemeanor counts of reckless endangerment and one felony count of first-degree endangering an aircraft, reported CBS News.Since then the National Transportation Safety Board has since hosted a first-of-its-kind forum focused on pilot mental health to examine current regulations.The FAA launched its own policy review, with both agencies advocating for reforms to remove barriers to mental health care.""Our pilots and air traffic controllers are not going to lose their job when they ask for help. We in this country must recognize that that's strength. And they're not to be punished. We're going to help them, process them, and get them back into cockpits,"" said Minnesota Rep. Pete Stauber, reported CBS News.Illinois Rep. Sean Casten and Minnesota Rep. Pete Stauber are spearheading a bipartisan push in Congress to implement reforms within two years through the Mental Health in Aviation Act. The legislation aims to improve access to mental health care for pilots and air traffic controllers and expand the number of medical examiners available.","Former Alaska Airlines pilot Joseph Emerson recalls the most “consequential three seconds” of his life when he had pulled down levers that could cut off fuel to the engines in an Alaska Air Flight 2059.

Who is Maurene Comey?





The US justice department has fired Maurene Comey, a federal prosecutor in Manhattan and the daughter of the former FBI director James Comey, on Wednesday. The reason for her firing was not immediately clear.Comey had worked on several high-profile cases, including the prosecution of financier Jeffrey Epstein as well as rapper Sean “Diddy” Combs.Reacting to the firing, Maurene Comey said there was no reason behind her dismissal. “Yesterday was unexpectedly my last day in the Office. I was summarily fired via memo from Main Justice that did not give a reason for my termination,” she wrote in an email to colleagues, reported the New York Post.This comes as the administration is embroiled in a controversy after closing the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein.Maurene Comey was a seasoned attorney in the Southern District of New York, widely regarded as one of the Justice Department's most prestigious prosecutorial offices.She famously worked on the prosecution of financier Jeffrey Epstein, who died in custody in 2019, as he was awaiting trial.Comey achieved significant success in several high-profile prosecutions, most notably securing the conviction of Ghislaine Maxwell on sex trafficking charges for assisting financier Jeffrey Epstein in the abuse of underage girls.In a declaration submitted in January, Comey argued that releasing documents on the Epstein case could harm the government’s position on a potential retrial of Maxwell. She said that making the materials public might expose witnesses “to possible embarrassment and harassment” potentially discouraging them from testifying, as per the New York Times.Most recently, Comey led the prosecution of Sean “Diddy” Combs. The trial against Combs ended in a split verdict and he was convicted on prostitution related charges but acquitted of more serious charges.In recent months, Comey came under repeated attacks from Trump’s right-wing base, including Laura Loomer, a far-right political activist, who urged attorney general Pam Bondi to fire her in May.","Maurene Comey, the daughter of former FBI director James Comey, was fired on Wednesday.

New video shows Travis Decker 3 days before he allegedly killed his daughters





Newly acquired video footage from the Wenatchee police department shows Travis Decker, 32, the fugitive father, accused of killing his three young daughters, just days before their disappearance.The footage captures Decker speaking with a police officer and another individual on May 27. Decker rear-ended another vehicle at a red light, and the second person in the video was the driver of that car, reported CBS News.In the nearly 20-minute-long video, Decker and the other person were seen speaking to each other and the officer. Towards the end of the video, Decker and the other driver shook hands before returning to their respective vehicles. The audio could not be intercepted from the clip.The driver whose car Decker had hit said that he was “nervous and fidgety” and kept on asking him to “not call the police,” as per KING 5. “I could tell he was not in his full senses,” the driver added.Travis Decker has been the subject of an intense manhunt since June 2 after officials found the bodies of three of his daughters, Paityn (9), Evelyn (8), and Olivia (5), at a campground near Leavenworth, Washington State.The girls were on a “planned visitation” with Decker on May 30. Decker’s vehicle was found abandoned near the girls’ bodies and officials announced that the bloody handprints on the truck’s tailgate matched the DNA profile of Decker's.As per court records, Decker’s ex-wife raised concerns over his mental health, highlighting that he became increasingly unstable and was often living out of his truck. She also mentioned that he had been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder but was not under any medication.Decker served in the US Army from 2013 to 2021, including a deployment to Afghanistan in 2014, and received training in navigation, survival, and wilderness skills. Police stated that he is currently wanted on three counts of first-degree murder and three counts of kidnapping.A probable cause affidavit revealed that Decker fled the scene of a different crash on May 4, although the other driver declined police follow-up since their vehicle was undamaged.","New video shows Travis Decker 3 days before he allegedly killed his daughters.

Is Yellowstone’s supervolcano about to erupt?

Are hydrothermal changes a cause for concern?

What scientists expect before a real eruption

A sharp increase in earthquake frequency and magnitude

Broad and rapid ground uplift

Elevated emissions of volcanic gases like sulphur dioxide

Unusual heat patterns across large areas

The reality of Yellowstone’s eruption cycle

Final word: Yellowstone remains safe





Yellowstone National Park has once again become the centre of global attention, not because of its geysers or wildlife, but due to viral social media claims suggesting an imminent supervolcano eruption. A widely circulated video appears to show a group of bears “fleeing” the park, stirring alarm across platforms like TikTok and Instagram. Users speculated that the animals were reacting to seismic activity beneath the surface. However, scientific evidence and expert monitoring tell a very different story. As of July 2025, the US Geological Survey and Yellowstone Volcano Observatory report no signs of impending volcanic unrest. Here’s a closer look at what’s really happening beneath Yellowstone’s surface — and what isn’t.The now-viral bear video, which triggered fears of an impending eruption, has been thoroughly debunked.Contrary to claims, the footage was not filmed in Yellowstone. It originated in January 2025 at Bear Country USA, a wildlife park in Rapid City, South Dakota. Wildlife experts confirm that the bears shown were part of a controlled, fenced environment and were not exhibiting unusual behaviour.Animal migrations in Yellowstone show no signs of panic. Experts note that bears and other animals tend to follow seasonal patterns, and there’s been no verified mass exodus from the park. Authorities urge the public to verify facts before sharing panic-driven posts online.The Yellowstone supervolcano remains at background levels of activity.According to the USGS and Yellowstone Volcano Observatory, the volcano alert level is NORMAL, and the aviation colour code is GREEN. These designations indicate that seismic and geothermal activity are within expected norms.In June 2025, 60 small earthquakes were recorded in the region. The largest measured magnitude 2.7 — well within Yellowstone's historical patterns and not linked to heightened volcanic risk. Regular geothermal features such as geysers and hot springs continue to operate without any unusual changes.Hydrothermal activity in Yellowstone is dynamic and constantly changing.Events like a new hydrothermal vent forming in Biscuit Basin (July 2024) or minor steam explosions are not uncommon. These phenomena result from shallow underground water interactions and do not suggest deeper magma movement.USGS scientists clarify that such changes, while sometimes dramatic, are part of Yellowstone’s geothermal landscape and are not considered precursors to a supervolcano eruption. In fact, these natural fluctuations have occurred for centuries without any major volcanic consequences. Staying informed through official sources is the best way to separate science from sensationalism.If Yellowstone were approaching a major eruption, multiple early warning signs would occur.Experts expect precursors like:None of these indicators are currently present. Continuous monitoring through GPS, seismic networks, and gas sensors provides scientists with real-time data capable of detecting any significant changes.The last supervolcanic eruption at Yellowstone occurred around 640,000 years ago.While some speculate on eruption intervals, scientists stress that supervolcanoes do not follow predictable schedules. Estimates suggest no such eruption is due for at least another 60,000 years.Recent studies also show the magma chamber beneath Yellowstone is not as full or pressurised as previously believed, further lowering the likelihood of sudden catastrophic activity.Despite social media rumours, there is no scientific basis for fears of an imminent Yellowstone supervolcano eruption.The viral bear video was misleading and not filmed in the park. Experts remain vigilant through advanced monitoring systems and have found no signs of escalating volcanic hazard.Yellowstone continues to be a safe destination for visitors, with its geothermal marvels and wildlife providing awe and inspiration — minus the eruption panic.","Despite social media rumours, there is no scientific basis for fears of an imminent Yellowstone supervolcano eruption.

Hamas FIRESTORM Blows Up Israeli Soldiers; IDF Admits Casualties, 32 Gazans Killed Near Aid Site





Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani criticized public broadcaster BBC for biased reporting on the ongoing Middle East conflict.He condemned the use of selective language in its coverage of the Israel-Gaza war, questioning why the outlet uses terms like “Iran-backed Houthis” or “Hamas-run hospital,” but avoids labels such as “US-backed IDF” or referring to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as an “indicted war criminal.”Mamdani questioned the broadcaster's choice of language, calling out its failure to apply similar labels to Israeli leaders and military forces as it does to other groups in the region.“Why does the BBC always include context like ‘Iran-backed Houthis’ and ‘Hamas-run hospital’ but never ‘US-backed IDF’ or ‘indicted-war-criminal Benjamin Netanyahu’?” Mamdani questioned in a post on X.Mamdani, a New York Assembly member and a vocal advocate for Palestinian rights, has long drawn attention for his positions on Israel and Palestine. A supporter of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, he has referred to Israel's military operations in Gaza as “genocide” and has introduced proposals to cut ties with firms operating in Israeli settlements in the West Bank.In a past interview on Fox5’s “Good Day New York,” Mamdani courted controversy when he said he did not support Israel’s existence as a Jewish state, arguing that no state should have a religious hierarchy.“Because I’m not comfortable supporting any state that has a hierarchy of citizenship on the basis of religion or anything else,” Mamdani said. ""In the way we have in this country, equality should be enshrined in every country in the world.”Mamdani’s remarks and political stance have not gone unnoticed. US President Donald Trump has frequently targeted him, most recently after Mamdani won the Democratic primary in New York City.In a post on Truth Social, Trump called Mamdani a “100% Communist Lunatic” and mocked him for looking ""terrible.""

'No Secret Police': Blue States Open Fresh Front Against Masked Unmarked ICE Agents I Details





A Mexican national accused of decapitating a missing Illinois woman and hiding her body in a bleach-filled container was re-arrested by US immigration authorities on Saturday (local time) in Chicago, months after he was released from custody despite facing serious charges.Jose Luis Mendoza-Gonzalez, a 52-year-old resident of Waukegan, Illinois, was first arrested in April after police discovered the body of 37-year-old Megan Bos in a container in his backyard. He was charged with concealing a corpse, abusing a corpse and obstruction of justice, according to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).However, shortly after his first court appearance, Lake County Judge Randie Bruno released Mendoza-Gonzalez under the provisions of Illinois' Safety, Accountability, Fairness and Equity-Today (SAFE-T) Act. The decision drew sharp criticism from public officials who questioned the release of someone accused of such a heinous crime.On Saturday, Mendoza-Gonzalez was taken back into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents at a market in Chicago. He now remains in ICE detention, DHS confirmed.The body of Megan Bos, who had been reported missing on March 9, was found in April. According to her family, she was last seen in February.Investigators allege that Mendoza-Gonzalez kept Bos’s body in his basement for two days before moving it to the yard, where it remained concealed for nearly two months.DHS officials said that Bos had been decapitated and her remains were found inside a container filled with bleach.""It is absolutely repulsive this monster walked free on Illinois’ streets after allegedly committing such a heinous crime,"" a DHS spokesperson said. ""Megan Bos and her family will have justice,"" as reported by Fox News.After Mendoza-Gonzalez's release in April, Antioch Mayor Scott Gartner criticized the laws that allowed the suspect’s release.""I was shocked to find out literally the next day that the person that they had arrested for this had been released from prison under the SAFE-T Act less than, detained less, I think, than 48 hours,"" Gartner said.Gartner emphasized that there are several other serious factors in this case, including the nature of the crime, how long it was hidden, and the fact that the suspect is not a US citizen and could potentially flee the country.Mendoza-Gonzalez reportedly told authorities that Bos had overdosed at his home. Instead of calling 911, he allegedly broke her phone and kept her body in the basement for two days before moving it outside.Republican State Representative Tom Weber also expressed his concern about Mendoza-Gonzalez's release in April.""Someone that hid their body in a garbage can for 51 days after leaving it in the basement for two days, after not calling 911 [and] breaking a phone. Is this a non-detainable offense?"" Weber said. ""Should we not find out, wait for a toxicology report, anything?""","Jose Luis Mendoza-Gonzalez, 52, was charged with concealing a corpse, abusing a corpse and obstruction of justice.

H-1B: Lottery versus weighted selection process







The Donald Trump administration is considering introducing a new process for H-1B hiring under the capped part of the system. The Department of Homeland Security sent the proposal to the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs for review. The capped part of the system means the statutory cap decided by Congress for every year. The cap is 85,000 slots, including 20,000 reserved for workers who have a master's degree.Universities and research institutions are eligible for cap-exempt visas.For 2026, the USCIS has already closed the process as they announced Friday that enough petitions had been submitted to reach the annual cap, which means there will be no lottery for FY 2026.In the present system, there's a random lottery each year for visas subject to the cap. After the lottery, employers with winning entries submit petitions to sponsor workers who will join their companies around October.In Donald Trump's first term, the DHS came up with a selection process based on the wage offered for a position instead of the random lottery so that companies hire more high-skilled workers instead of filling their positions with low-wage foreign workers.That rule, one of several offered as part of a “Buy American, Hire American” initiative, was later shelved by the Biden administration in 2021. The draft regulations drew more than 1,000 public comments, including many that argued it would drastically reduce the number of available H-1B workers, Bloomberg reported.The lottery system was brought in so that no company or applicant would get any favor. But larger companies can apply for more visas resulting in such companies getting more H-1Bs.In January, the Institute for Progress, a nonpartisan think tank examining innovation policy, floated the idea of eliminating the H-1B lottery. It argued that the economic value of the visa program could be increased by 88 per cent of applicants were evaluated based on seniority or salary.","The Department of Homeland Security sent the proposal to the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs for review.

TOI correspondent from Washington:

Asim Munir for President? Pakistan Defence Minister Denies Amid Buzz Of Asif Ali Zardari Quitting





A political and diplomatic dogfight is underway over a prospective visit to Pakistan by US President Donald Trump en route to the Quad summit in India in September amid a gradual recalibration of ties in the region.Pakistani business leaders and influencers are working overtime to convince the White House of a Trump visit after pulling off a coup by arranging a luncheon meeting last month for the country's army chief Asim Munir with the US President.Munir charmed Trump by endorsing him for a Nobel Peace Prize, playing up to his craving for one, and the Pakistanis are now promising the US President more honors and trade access if he visits, despite having thrown itself at China's feet for survival.Although the White House has not confirmed Trump's Quad attendance given New Delhi is yet to nail the dates -- which also depends on the leaders of Japan and Australia -- Pakistan's excitable media broadcast that the US President would visit Pakistan on September 18, before retracting the report because Trump will be on a state visit to the UK from September 17-19.There are indications though that Trump may stopover in Pakistan whenever he heads out to the Quad summit.This could be as late as November given the MAGA supremo's obsession with trade deals over strategic alignments. He has just delivered a tariff shock to Japan and also riled up Australia, while India has proved to be a tough negotiator, frustrating his trade boffins attempts to strong-arm New Delhi into a quick deal.In fact, Trump's fetish for tariffs and his fixation on trade deals puts a question mark over the strategic salience of the Quad even as long-time allies and partners adjust to his mercurial approach.According to some diplomats, India itself may have to reassess its approach to Trump-era Washington after a rosy-eyed view of long-term strategic ties with the US. They acknowledge that Trump’s response during his second term to the Pakistani outreach – driven more by opportunism than any strategic vision – clearly caught India off guard. New Delhi resents the re-hyphenation that would be implicit in such a two-fer, but has no way of thwarting it.If Trump does visit Pakistan, it will be the first US Presidential trip to the country in nearly two decades after George W Bush layover in 2006. Bush stopped by in Islamabad for a few hours under a tight security blanket on his way back from a three-day visit to New Delhi, talking up counter-terrorism cooperation with Pakistan while rejecting its pleas for a nuclear deal similar to the one he forged with India.Presidents Obama and Biden both disdained even a stopover while Trump himself trashed Pakistan during his first term, accusing it of ""nothing but lies & deceit"" and providing ""safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan.""Pakistan is now promising to turn itself into a safe haven for US businesses promoted by Trump associates -- including transforming Islamabad into the ""crypto capital of South Asia"" and a ""global leader in the digital finance revolution,’ -- to land a Presidential visit.During his first term, Trump is famously said to have complained about landing in Iraq and Afghanistan with the lights on Air Force One turned off (as a security measure), despite the US having spent billions on the countries. If the Pakistan stopover comes through, he may well insist on landing in full sight – to soak up the fanfare and flattery.","Pakistani business leaders and influencers are working overtime to convince the White House of a Trump visit.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan said on Monday it was creating a national paramilitary force, prompting concern among opposition parties and human rights groups that it could be used as a tool of political repression.The move turns an existing paramilitary force deployed on Pakistan’s northwestern border with Afghanistan into a national security force that will be called the Federal Constabulary, state minister for the interior Talal Chaudhry told a press conference in the eastern city of Faisalabad. Its new duties will include internal security, riot control and counter-terrorism, according to a copy of the amended law reported by the local Dunya News TV.The announcement came after Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party of former jailed PM Imran Khan said it would stage nationwide protests starting on Aug 5, the second anniversary of his arrest. Several such protests since his Aug 2023 arrest have turned violent, in some cases paralysing the capital Islamabad for days.“This will be a new force. This will be a stronger force. We need this force for internal security,” Chaudhry said, adding that President Asif Ali Zardari had already approved amendments in the law introducing changes in the paramilitary force.The new force replaces the Frontier Constabulary (FC), whose cadres were previously recruited only from tribes in the northwestern province, Chaudhry said.Training of the new force will bring it into line with other national law enforcement agencies, he added. Khan’s party spokesperson Zulfikar Bukhari said the changes should be subject to parliamentary discussion.The new force “should not be used as a gimmick to silence political opponents, as has been previously witnessed when the government applied such laws against a large number of the PTI leadership and supporters,” he said. His concern was echoed by Haris Khalique, secretary of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, an independent body. “We are alarmed by the changes being made to the security and law enforcement structure of the country without any debate in parliament,” Khalique said.REUTERS","The move turns an existing paramilitary force deployed on Pakistan’s northwestern border with Afghanistan into a national security force.

Lahore recorded three cases, while Islamabad and four districts in KP also registered positive samples. In Balochistan, the virus was found in Mastung, Khuzdar, and Sibi. Mirpur in PoJK also showed signs of the virus.This alarming development follows Pakistan’s second national polio vaccination drive earlier this year, which saw over 60,000 refusals, 39,000 of them in Karachi alone. These refusals, officials say, are now posing a major roadblock to the country’s eradication efforts.“We’re not just fighting a virus; we’re battling misinformation and mistrust,” a senior health official told ARY News.Pakistan remains one of only two countries where polio is still endemic, the other being Afghanistan. With the confirmation of another new case this week, the total number of polio cases in the country has reached 13 so far in 2025.Health experts warn that the virus spreads primarily through contaminated water or food and can cause paralysis or death. There is no cure for polio, making vaccination the only defense. The World Health Organisation emphasises that multiple oral doses are needed to protect children under five, the group most vulnerable to the disease.Despite ongoing national campaigns, large pockets in southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa remain difficult to access for vaccination teams, leaving thousands of children at risk.As the virus resurfaces in urban and rural sewers alike, officials say the next phase in Pakistan’s anti-polio war must tackle both the virus, and vaccine hesitancy, with equal urgency.","Sindh reported the highest contamination, with 14 positive samples from 10 districts.

Pakistan’s economic performance under the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) $7 billion loan programme has been “strong so far”, according to Mahir Binici, the IMF’s Resident Representative for Pakistan, reported PTI.Speaking at a lecture hosted by the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) in Islamabad on Sunday, Binici said Pakistan’s first review under the three-year Extended Fund Facility (EFF), approved in July 2024, was successfully completed by the IMF Executive Board in May.The EFF aims to cement macroeconomic stability and lay the groundwork for “stronger, more inclusive and resilient growth,” he said. So far, Pakistan has received two instalments under the programme, with the government implementing agreed policy measures aimed at fiscal discipline and investor confidence.“Early policy measures have helped restore macroeconomic stability and rebuild investor confidence, despite persistent external challenges,” Binici noted.He stressed the importance of structural reforms to ensure long-term economic sustainability, including strengthening tax equity, improving the business climate, and encouraging private-sector-led investment.Binici also welcomed Pakistan’s commitment to climate-related reforms under the $1.3 billion Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF), approved in March.The RSF supports projects focused on disaster preparedness, efficient water use, green investments, and better climate data transparency.“Support through the RSF will not only strengthen Pakistan’s climate resilience but also help unlock green investments and foster a more climate-conscious economic trajectory,” he said.On regional prospects, Binici said economic growth in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, including Pakistan, was expected to improve in 2025 and beyond. However, he warned that global economic uncertainty remains high due to trade tensions, geopolitical fragmentation, and weakening cooperation.","Pakistan's economic performance under IMF's $7 billion loan programme has been'strong so far' Mahir Binici, the IMF’s Resident Representative for Pakistan, spoke at a lecture in Islamabad.

Karachi blackout protest chokes city traffic: Punjab Colony residents block roads after 24-hour outage; report points to systemic collapse,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/karachi-blackout-protest-chokes-city-traffic-punjab-colony-residents-block-roads-after-24-hour-outage-report-points-to-systemic-collapse/articleshow/122418234.cms,"



A protest over a prolonged power outage in Karachi’s Punjab Colony spiraled into city-wide traffic chaos on Saturday, underscoring what many see as chronic governance failure and energy mismanagement in Pakistan, Dawn reported.Residents of an 80-flat, 10-storey building blocked a major road near Punjab Chowrangi after going more than 24 hours without electricity. Power had reportedly been out since 11 am Friday, and despite repeated complaints, K-Electric, Karachi’s sole power distributor, allegedly failed to respond.The resulting sit-in crippled traffic on Defence Road and nearby areas. Long queues of trucks and tankers vital to Karachi Port were stalled from Qayyumabad to the KPT Flyover. Major intersections like Boat Basin, Gizri, and Hino Chowrangi were brought to a standstill, leaving thousands of commuters stranded, according to Dawn.The outage reportedly followed K-Electric’s anti-theft operation in the adjacent P&T Colony. Protesters claimed legal connections were also cut off in the sweep, with no clear procedure followed. KE, however, described the protestors as ""miscreants"" attempting to restore illegal connections and said their teams were attacked during the operation, allegedly linked to a cable TV network.No evidence was provided implicating all affected residents in theft.While KE later claimed to have restored power to parts of the area, the larger issue remains unresolved. The incident highlights Pakistan’s ongoing struggle to provide reliable electricity, exacerbated by outdated infrastructure and lack of accountability in power distribution.As Dawn noted, the crisis is less about one blackout and more a reflection of systemic dysfunction, where citizens bear the brunt of institutional failure.","Residents of an 80-flat, 10-storey building blocked a major road near Punjab Chowrangi after going more than 24 hours without electricity.

Poll Should passengers receive more training on recognizing flight details? Yes, it’s important No, it's the airline's job





In a major goof-up, a Pakistani airline flew a passenger to Jeddah in Saudi Arabia instead of Karachi, his actual destination.Shahzain, the affected passenger, alleged that he was not informed that he had boarded the wrong flight despite showing his ticket to the air hostess, ARY News reported.The passenger had to travel from Lahore, Pakistan's second-largest city, to Karachi, the largest.According to Shahzain, two planes were parked at Lahore airport's domestic terminal gate, and he was not aware of the mistake until it was too late.He has now sent a legal notice to the carrier, accusing it of causing him distress by its negligence.He demanded that the airline cover the additional travel expenses he incurred. He also sought compensation for the inconvenience and trouble he faced.Additionally, Shahzain confirmed he did not have a passport or visa for international travel.Two hours into the flight, I questioned why the plane had not yet reached Karachi.

PESHAWAR: An under-construction government primary school for girls in Pakistan's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province was damaged in an IED blast by unknown militants, police said on Friday.No casualties were reported as the building was unoccupied at the time of the explosion.Militants had planted an explosive material inside the premises of the Azaan Javed Primary School in Baka Khel police jurisdiction of Bannu district.The device was detonated with a powerful blast, causing substantial structural damage to the building.An FIR has been registered and forensic teams have been deployed to collect evidence from the blast site, police said.Authorities have condemned the attack as an attempt to derail educational development in the region.According to a report by the Lowy Institute, an Australian think tank, more than 1,100 girls' schools have been destroyed in the tribal areas between 2007 to 2017, with teachers and young students also targeted.Before an all-out military operation launched by Pakistan's security forces in 2014, the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) carried out hundreds of attacks on girls' schools in the tribal areas and settled districts of the northwestern province from its stronghold in Swat district.After the crackdown, TTP militants fled to Afghanistan and began to orchestrate cross border attacks from their new sanctuaries.The Taliban takeover of Kabul has emboldened the TTP, which is fighting to regain control of its strongholds in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.Since the takeover of Afghanistan in 2021, the Taliban has banned girls from attending school beyond the sixth grade and banned women from universities.Pakistani Taliban, who are ideologically closer to Afghan Taliban, are trying to enforce a similar anti-education and theocratic agenda in Pakistan's tribal areas by force.The youngest Nobel Prize laureate, Malala Yousafzai, who is from Swat district, was shot in the face when she was 14 by TTP gunmen in 2012 as she wanted to pursue her education.","Militants planted an explosive material inside the premises of the Azaan Javed Primary School.

Afghanistan was rocked by two more earthquakes early Saturday with a magnitude of around 4.0 on Richter scale, marking fifth such seismic event in the past week, according to the National Center for Seismology (NCS).The first tremor, recorded at 1.26 am IST, measured 4.2 on the Richter scale with a depth of 190 km. The second quake struck just 45 minutes later at 2:11 am IST, registering a magnitude of 4.0 and a depth of 125 km. Both events were located in the northern region of Afghanistan, based on NCS data.On Friday night, another quake measuring 4.6 also shook the region. Earlier in the week, two more quakes of magnitudes 4.7 and 4.3 were reported, making this the fifth seismic jolt since July 17.Afghanistan’s vulnerability to frequent and often destructive earthquakes stems from its location at the convergence of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates. The Hindu Kush mountain range, in particular, experiences frequent tremors and aftershocks.The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) notes that Afghanistan remains highly prone to natural disasters including earthquakes, landslides, and seasonal floods. These events further strain communities already grappling with decades of conflict and limited infrastructure, making disaster response and recovery particularly challenging.","The first tremor measured 4.2 on the Richter scale with a depth of 190 km.

Nicknamed “Sika Golf” and believed to be in her mid-30s

Arrested in Nonthaburi province on charges of extortion and money laundering

Allegedly blackmailed multiple senior monks after initiating sexual relationships

Claimed to be pregnant to extract over 7 million baht from one monk

Received around 385 million baht over three years, mostly from temple-linked accounts

Told media she had fallen in love with some of the monks and gave money to one

Reportedly spent much of the funds on online gambling

Phones seized from her home contained tens of thousands of compromising images and videos

Police say she is connected to multiple temples across Thailand

Has become a lightning rod in a scandal that has triggered broader questions about the abuse of wealth and status in Thai Buddhism.





A dramatic scandal involving Thailand’s senior Buddhist clergy has gripped the nation after the disappearance of a well-known monk led to a web of blackmail, sex, and temple money trails. At the centre of it all is Wilawan Emsawat, a woman now accused of seducing and extorting powerful monks, and exposing a deeper rot in Thailand’s religious institutions.The controversy erupted after Phra Thep Wachirapamok, a respected monk from a central Bangkok temple, vanished without a trace. Investigators soon found the trail led to Wilawan, whose home was reportedly filled with phones containing tens of thousands of compromising images and videos involving monks. Her financial records showed deposits linked to temple accounts, drawing in at least nine senior clergy who have since been disrobed or dismissed.Police say Wilawan used romantic relationships with monks to pressure them into paying large sums to maintain silence, money often transferred directly from temple funds. She allegedly claimed to be pregnant in one case and demanded 7.2 million baht from a monk who later fled the monkhood, the Guardian reported.Wilawan, now in her mid-30s, was arrested in Nonthaburi province on charges of extortion, money laundering, and receiving stolen property. She has not commented since her arrest, and it remains unclear whether she has legal representation. However, before her arrest, she admitted to relationships with at least two monks and a religious academic. She also expressed guilt, saying she had “fallen in love.”Police say 385 million baht (around $11.9 million) passed through Wilawan’s accounts in three years, much of which was spent on online gambling, as per the report.Thailand’s acting Prime Minister has now ordered a review of laws governing monk behaviour and temple finances, amid growing calls for reform.

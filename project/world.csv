Peace push: US eyes Budapest for Donald Trump-Putin-Zelenskyy meet; Russia signals gradual approach,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/peace-push-us-eyes-budapest-for-donald-trump-putin-zelenskyy-meet-russia-signals-gradual-approach/articleshow/123397580.cms,"File photo: Russian President Vladimir Putin, US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy (Picture credit: AP)





The White House is considering Budapest as the potential venue for a high-stakes trilateral meeting between US President Donald Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, according to a Trump administration official and a person familiar with the discussions.According to Politico, the US Secret Service has begun preparations in Hungary, led by Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, a long-time ally of Trump. However, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt declined to confirm details, saying, “I’m not going to confirm or deny locations.”While Moscow has pushed for the talks to take place in Russia and French President Emmanuel Macron has suggested Geneva, Budapest has emerged as the frontrunner, Politico noted.Switzerland also offered itself as a host, with its foreign minister promising “immunity” to Putin despite an outstanding war crimes warrant.Hungary’s selection would be sensitive for Kyiv, recalling the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, under which the US, UK and Russia guaranteed Ukraine’s sovereignty in exchange for it giving up nuclear weapons, a pledge undermined by Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea.Despite ongoing uncertainty, momentum has built following Trump’s recent Alaska meeting with Putin.German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said a bilateral between Putin and Zelenskyy could happen within weeks, with Trump later announcing he would join them in a trilateral format as a “final step.”Russian officials, however, are said to be slowing progress. Foreign minister Sergey Lavrov told state television Moscow favoured talks that proceed “step by step, gradually.”At Tuesday’s briefing, Leavitt confirmed that “President Trump spoke with President Putin by phone, and he agreed to begin the next phase of the peace process, a meeting between President Putin and President Zelenskyy, which would be followed, if necessary, by a trilateral meeting between President Putin, President Zelenskyy and President Trump.”As per Fox News, she added that Vice President JD Vance, secretary of state Marco Rubio and special envoy Steve Witkoff were coordinating efforts to make the bilateral happen “as soon as possible.”The update came a day after Zelenskyy and several European leaders met Trump at the White House to discuss next steps. Leaders praised Trump’s role, with Finnish President Alexander Stubb remarking, “In the past two weeks, we’ve probably had more progress in ending this war than we have in the past three-and-a-half years.”UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer echoed the view, saying that for years “nobody has been able to bring it to this point.” Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte added, “Without President Trump, this deadlock with Putin would not have been broken.”According to Politico, Nato defence chiefs and senior military leaders from the US, UK, Germany, France, Finland and Italy are holding parallel talks in Washington on possible security guarantees for Ukraine, including discussions over a peacekeeping mission and additional American arms.Putin, meanwhile, used his joint press conference with Trump in Alaska to endorse Trump’s long-standing claim about the origins of the war, saying, “I can confirm that” Russia would not have invaded Ukraine if Trump had been re-elected in 2020.As questions continue about long-term security guarantees for Ukraine beyond Trump’s current term, Leavitt said the president “understands the need” and is discussing future commitments with Nato and European partners.","The White House is considering Budapest as the potential venue for a high-stakes trilateral meeting between US President Donald Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Over 50 people killed, including 17 children, in western Afghanistan after a bus carrying refugees collided with a truck and motorcycle and caught fire, according to provincial government spokesman Ahmadullah Muttaqi and local police.According to a news report from Al Jazeera, police said that the accident occurred due to the excessive speed and negligence of the bus. The bus route to Kabul was carrying refugees who were recently deported from Iran, according to provincial official Mohammad Yousuf Saeedi.They were part of a massive wave of Afghans who were deported from Iran recently.Earlier, Iranian minister of interior Eskandar Momeni announced that around 800,000 people would be deported by March.Saeedi said that all the passengers boarded the bus at a border crossing point, Islam Qala.Three passengers survived the accident after the bus collided with a motorcycle first and then hit the truck, which was carrying fuel. The collision was so strong that it led to the eruption of fire.Two people in the truck and another two on the motorcycle were among the deceased.","A bus carrying refugees collided with a truck and motorcycle and caught fire.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Tuesday asserted that US President Donald Trump is the only American leader this century to have “held Russia in check and ensured peace in Europe,” while strongly defending his recent efforts to broker an end to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict.Speaking after Trump’s meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Leavitt said history showed a pattern of Russian aggression under past administrations.“Just look at what took place during the last four administrations. Under George W. Bush, Russia invaded Georgia. Under Barack Obama, Russia took Crimea. Under Joe Biden, Russia invaded Ukraine. But under President Trump, Russia did not invade or take anything,” she said.Trump has frequently criticised his predecessors, including Barack Obama’s handling of Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014. Leavitt reiterated that the current war “never would have started” had Trump been in office in 2022, adding that Russian President Vladimir Putin himself confirmed this point during their recent talks in Anchorage, Alaska.According to news agency ANI, Leavitt said the Alaska meeting was “very productive” and opened the way for “phase two” discussions at the White House within 48 hours.She credited Trump’s “relentless pursuit of peace” in his second term with breaking years of “deadly gridlock” in the conflict. “Thanks to President Trump’s efforts, we finally have movement after years of deadly gridlock,” she said.European leaders and Nato officials also backed Trump’s role, Leavitt claimed. Quoting Finnish President Alexander Stub, she said, “In the past two weeks, we’ve probably had more progress in ending this war than in the past three and a half years.”Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte was also cited as saying, “Without President Trump, this deadlock with Putin would not have been broken. He is the only one who could do this.”Leavitt announced that following discussions, Putin had agreed to a meeting with Zelenskyy, potentially followed by a trilateral summit involving Trump himself.Meanwhile, Vice President JD Vance publicly praised Leavitt for “lighting the American media up for lying about our negotiations with Russia and Ukraine” in a post on X.The press secretary accused sections of the media of “actively rooting against the president of the United States in the pursuit of peace.”She criticised coverage of Trump’s August 15 talks with Putin, saying the media wrongly portrayed them as a “defeat.”“The so-called experts in the foreign policy establishment, whose record is nothing but endless wars, trillions of wasted taxpayer dollars, and dead Americans, have the nerve to lecture President Trump,” she said, noting his record of peace deals, including the Abraham Accords.Leavitt concluded by contrasting Trump’s approach with previous administrations. “While previous presidents travelled halfway around the world to apologise for America, President Trump stands up for America, and he has firmly restored America’s status as the undisputed leader of the free world,” she said.","White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said history showed a pattern of Russian aggression under past administrations.

Mail-in voting trends





US President Donald Trump on Monday announced that he would lead a movement to abolish mail-in ballots and voting machines before the 2026 midterm elections, saying they fueled “massive voter fraud” and undermined confidence in the electoral process.In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump said he planned to sign an executive order aimed at eliminating what he described as “highly inaccurate” and “controversial” voting machines, while pushing for traditional paper ballots with watermarks.According to Trump, paper ballots were faster, more reliable, and left “no doubt” about election results. “I am going to lead a movement to get rid of MAIL-IN BALLOTS, and also, while we’re at it, Highly ‘Inaccurate,’ Very Expensive, and Seriously Controversial VOTING MACHINES, which cost Ten Times more than accurate and sophisticated Watermark Paper,” he posted.He added that the effort, which he expected Democrats to oppose, would help bring “honesty” to the 2026 midterm elections. “We are now the only Country in the World that uses Mail-In Voting. All others gave it up because of the MASSIVE VOTER FRAUD ENCOUNTERED,” Trump wrote.Trump argued that states were merely “agents” of the federal government in counting and tabulating votes and insisted they must follow presidential directives “for the good of the country.”He accused Democrats of relying on mail-in voting to remain competitive due to their “radical left” policies. “With their HORRIBLE Radical Left policies, like Open Borders, Men Playing in Women’s Sports, Transgender and ‘WOKE’ for everyone, and so much more, Democrats are virtually Unelectable without using this completely disproven Mail-In SCAM,” Trump said.“Elections can never be honest with mail-in ballots or voting machines, and everybody knows it, especially the Democrats,” he added.Trump’s comments came days after his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Following the meeting, Trump said Putin agreed with him on ending mail-in balloting.""Vladimir Putin, smart guy, said you can't have an honest election with mail-in voting,"" Trump told Fox News after Friday's Alaska summit.Mail-in voting allows eligible voters to cast ballots through the postal system. It includes absentee ballots, used when voters cannot reach polling stations due to illness, travel, or other valid reasons, and mail-in ballots, which can be requested by any eligible voter in many states.A mail-in ballot refers to the actual ballot paper that voters complete and return by mail under this system.Although mail-in voting has long been part of the US election process, Trump has repeatedly attacked it since the 2020 presidential election, claiming it enabled widespread fraud.However, election officials and courts have found no evidence of large-scale fraud linked to mail-in ballots.Despite Trump’s opposition, several Republican-led states, including Florida, have embraced mail-in voting as a secure and convenient method of expanding voter participation. Trump himself voted by mail in previous elections and had encouraged his supporters to do the same for the 2024 presidential election.Mail-in ballots reached record highs in 2020, when states expanded options amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Usage declined in 2024, according to the US Election Assistance Commission.In the 2024 general election, more than two-thirds of voters cast ballots in person, while about three in 10 voted by mail. Every US state offers some form of absentee or mail-in ballot option, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.","US President Donald Trump announced he would lead a movement to abolish mail-in ballots and voting machines before the 2026 midterm elections.

Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Monday said he would deploy 4.5 million members of the country’s militia in response to what he described as renewed threats from the United States, after Washington raised the bounty for his arrest and launched anti-drug operations in the Caribbean.""This week, I will activate a special plan with more than 4.5 million militiamen to ensure coverage of the entire national territory -- militias that are prepared, activated and armed,"" Maduro announced on state television.The militia, created by Maduro’s predecessor Hugo Chavez, is officially said to number about five million, though the real figure is believed to be lower. Venezuela’s overall population is around 30 million.Maduro denounced what he called ""the renewal of extravagant, bizarre, and outlandish threats"" from Washington.Earlier this month, the administration of US President Donald Trump doubled its reward to $50 million for Maduro’s capture. He faces US drug trafficking charges, with Washington accusing him of leading the Cartel de los Soles, a network it blames for large-scale cocaine smuggling. The Trump administration also announced sanctions against the group and the Venezuelan government last month.The US military has reportedly dispatched several vessels to the southern Caribbean as part of Trump’s campaign against Latin American drug cartels. ""We are also deployed throughout the Caribbean... in our sea, our property, Venezuelan territory,"" Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello said.Though he did not directly reference the recent US actions, Maduro thanked allies for supporting Venezuela against what he called a ""rotten refrain"" of threats. He also urged the expansion of worker and peasant militias across all industries.""Rifles and missiles for the peasant force!

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Tuesday said President Donald Trump had directed that the US-Mexico border wall be painted black, arguing that the dark surface would make it too hot for migrants to climb.Speaking at a press conference in Santa Teresa, New Mexico, Noem said, ""that is specifically at the request of the president, who understands that in the hot temperatures down here, when something is painted black, it gets even warmer, and it will make it even harder for people to climb.”“Now, if you look at the structure that’s behind me, it’s tall, which makes it very, very difficult to climb, almost impossible. It also goes deep into the ground, which would make it very difficult, if not impossible, to dig under. And today, we are also going to be painting it black"", she added.Trump had signed what he called a “big, beautiful bill” last month, allocating $165 billion to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The bulk of the funds were earmarked for strengthening the southern border and deporting migrants who were in the country illegally. Of this, $46.5 billion was dedicated to the construction of the new border wall, work on which had begun during Trump’s first term in the White House.Noem said the wall would also undergo a technological upgrade with the addition of “technology, cameras, sensors.”Reports of Trump’s plans to paint the border wall black had first surfaced during his earlier administration in 2020, when officials confirmed they were testing a black coating along certain sections.","Trump administration pushes for US-Mexico border makeover; paint walls black to deter migrants.

What is Cesium-137, why is it harmful?





The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Monday warned consumers not to eat certain frozen shrimp products sold at Walmart after tests revealed possible contamination with Cesium-137, a radioactive isotope.Federal officials said three lots of Great Value brand frozen shrimp were pulled from Walmart stores after the isotope was detected in shipping containers and a sample of breaded shrimp imported from Indonesia. “If you have recently purchased raw frozen shrimp from Walmart that matches this description, throw it away,” FDA officials said in a statement.Walmart has recalled frozen, raw shrimp sold in 13 states following the warning, the Associated Press reported.Cesium-137, also known as Cs-137, is a byproduct of nuclear reactions, including nuclear weapons testing, reactor operations and nuclear accidents. It is the most common radioactive isotope of cesium, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Cs-137 is also used in medical devices, gauges, and radiation therapy to treat cancer, while in some cases, it emerges as a waste product of nuclear reactors.According to the agency, exposure to low levels of Cesium-137 over time could pose a “potential health concern.”Trace amounts of the isotope are found globally in soil, air and food. While the levels detected in the shrimp were far below FDA intervention thresholds, officials said avoiding potentially contaminated products could help reduce unnecessary exposure to radiation.",FDA warns against consuming certain frozen shrips; cites potential Cesium-137 contamination.

'Trump used trade in a very powerful way as leverage': White House again claims US President ended India-Pak conflict,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-used-trade-in-a-very-powerful-way-as-leverage-white-house-again-claims-us-president-ended-india-pak-conflict/articleshow/123395431.cms,"White House said Trump used trade as leverage to end the conflict between India and Pakistan.





The White House again claimed US President Donald Trump ended the conflict between India and Pakistan -- despite repeated rejection from New Delhi. White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt detailed the conflicts that President Trump resolved in the past few months as she spoke at great length about Trump's meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and also the European leaders.“We've seen it with the end of the conflict between India and Pakistan, which could have resulted in a nuclear war if we had not had a President who believed in the strength and the leverage that comes with the job of being the President of the United States of America,” Leavitt said, detailing the seven global conflicts.Leavitt was asked which peace deals Trump is most proud of. Leavitt said she would have to ask President Trump for the answer but she's certain that Trump is proud of each one of them. After mentioning Armenia-Azerbaijan and Rwanda and the Republic of Congo, the White House spokesperson mentioned India and Pakistan and said, ""President Trump used trade in a powerful way as a leverage to bring that conflict to an end.""Leavitt made another mention of India as she spoke about tariffs. “The President has put tremendous public pressure to bring this war to a close. He has taken actions as you seen sanctions on India and other actions as well.He has made himself very clear that he wants to see this war end,” she added.Trump imposed a 50 per cent tariff on India to be effective from August 27. A US team was set to visit India for negotiations, but it reportedly deferred the visit.US treasury secretary Scott Bessent also accused India of “profiteering” by reselling Russian oil. In an interview with CNBC, Bessent said India is reselling and making a profit. ""This is what I would call the Indian arbitrage -- buying cheap Russian oil, reselling it as product. They'sve made $16 billion in excess profits -- some of the richest families in India,"" he said.",White House said Trump used trade as leverage to end the conflict between India and Pakistan.

Rescuers in Pakistan are struggling to recover bodies after flash floods triggered by relentless monsoon rains killed at least 321 people in the past 48 hours, officials told AFP on Saturday. Most casualties were reported in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where 307 people died as rivers burst their banks and houses collapsed.A video shared by RT.com showed the scale of destruction as torrents swept through towns and villages, leaving entire neighbourhoods in ruins. The floods, described by residents as “doomsday”, have left many communities cut off with relief efforts hampered by washed-out roads and ongoing rainfall.Authorities said around 2,000 rescue workers are engaged in operations across nine districts, but access remains severely restricted.“Heavy rainfall, landslides in several areas, and washed-out roads are causing significant challenges in delivering aid, particularly in transporting heavy machinery and ambulances,” Bilal Ahmed Faizi, spokesman for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s rescue agency, told AFP.“Due to road closures in most areas, rescue workers are travelling on foot to conduct operations in remote regions,” he added.Buner district has been hardest hit, recording at least 184 deaths. Other badly affected areas include Shangla, Mansehra, Swat, Bajaur and Battagram. The provincial government has declared these mountainous districts as disaster zones.Survivors have described terrifying scenes as torrents tore through homes without warning.“I heard a loud noise as if the mountain was sliding. I rushed outside and saw the entire area shaking, like it was the end of the world,” Azizullah told AFP. “The ground was trembling due to the force of the water, and it felt like death was staring me in the face.”Mass funerals were held across affected districts on Friday, with mourners grieving in front of rows of bodies covered by blankets. Local schoolteacher Saifullah Khan said: “We still have no clear idea who in this small village is alive and who is dead. I help retrieve the bodies of the children I taught, I keep wondering what kind of trial nature has imposed on these kids.”Officials warned the death toll is likely to rise further as dozens remain missing. Pakistan’s meteorological department has issued more rain alerts, warning that the intensity of the monsoon will worsen over the next two weeks.","Floods triggered by relentless monsoon rains have killed at least 321 people in Pakistan.

Flash floods caused by heavy rains have killed over 320 people in Pakistan, with dozens still missing. The worst hit was Buner district in the northwest, where 157 people died on Friday after homes and villages were swept away.Authorities declared a state of emergency in Buner as rescuers, using boats and helicopters, struggled to reach stranded families.

Pakistan watching Kabul basin closely

Climate crisis drives displacement





After decades of war, Afghanistan is moving to assert sovereignty over its water resources, a shift that is testing fragile ties with neighbouring countries.Since taking power in 2021, the Taliban have launched large-scale infrastructure projects, including dams and canals, to harness river flows that spill into Iran, Pakistan, and Central Asia.But as per news agency AFP, these efforts are fuelling disputes, with climate change worsening water shortages across the region.The most contentious initiative is the Qosh Tepa canal, a mega-project designed to irrigate 560,000 hectares of farmland in northern Afghanistan. Experts say it could divert up to 21 per cent of the Amu Darya’s flow, a river already vital for water-stressed Central Asian states. Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, backed by Kazakhstan, have raised alarms that the project could further shrink the Aral Sea and destabilise the region’s water-sharing arrangements, which date back to the Soviet era.Water governance specialist Mohd Faizee cautioned and was quoted by AFP as saying, “No matter how friendly the tone is now, at some point there will be consequences for Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan when the canal starts operating.”Taliban officials, however, insist the canal will not cause significant harm. Project manager Sayed Zabihullah Miri was cited by AFP as saying that the Amu Darya has “an abundance of water, especially when it floods and glacial meltwater flows into it”.They argue the project is critical to boosting food security in a country where climate-driven crop failures and humanitarian crises remain widespread.Iran, Afghanistan’s western neighbour, is the only country with a formal water-sharing treaty, signed in 1973 over the Helmand river. But the accord has never been fully honoured. Tehran frequently accuses Kabul of restricting flows through upstream dams, especially during droughts.The Taliban maintain that water scarcity, worsened by climate change, leaves them unable to release more.A report by the Afghanistan Analysts Network noted that Afghan authorities also believe they have long been denied their fair share of Helmand waters due to poor management and political neglect.Meanwhile, disputes also simmer over the Harirud basin, which flows into Iran and Turkmenistan, where Afghanistan recently inaugurated the Pashdan dam. Analysts say reduced security risks after the war could accelerate such projects, reshaping regional water dynamics.To the east, Afghanistan shares the Kabul river basin with Pakistan, which eventually feeds into the Indus. Unlike Iran, no treaty exists between the two neighbours. While water disputes have not dominated their rocky bilateral relations, Kabul’s attempts to revive old river projects and build new ones could trigger friction.Yet, Afghanistan’s financial struggles and lack of technical expertise mean most large-scale projects will take years to complete. This delay may ease immediate diplomatic concerns, but for Afghans grappling with severe water shortages in the capital and beyond, the wait could deepen suffering.Afghanistan’s water disputes cannot be separated from the worsening climate emergency. According to the UN’s International Organisation for Migration (IOM), nearly five million people were affected by floods, droughts, and other climate shocks in early 2025, with almost 400,000 displaced.“Crop failure, dry pastures and vanishing water sources are pushing rural communities to the edge,” the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation warned in July.Villagers in the north were quoted by AFP as saying that they were pinning hopes on the Qosh Tepa canal to revive farming, though its completion is still more than a year away. In contrast, communities in western Herat have watched the Harirud river run dry, forcing families who were deported from Iran to return to barren land with little to farm.Meanwhile, extreme rainfall has added another layer of crisis. Warmer temperatures mean heavier downpours, often triggering devastating flash floods. In Maidan Wardak, a community leader said, “I’m around 54 years old, and we have never experienced problems like this before.”Taliban officials admit their efforts fall short. Energy and water minister Abdul Latif Mansoor recently conceded that while canal and dam projects are underway, “the measures we have taken so far are not enough”.Limited funding, international isolation and restrictive governance have left Afghanistan struggling to cope with climate shocks, even as it faces one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises.For millions of Afghans, everything now comes down to water, too little in times of drought, too much during floods, as the Taliban’s push for control over rivers becomes a defining issue for the country and its neighbours alike.","Afghanistan is moving to assert sovereignty over its water resources, a shift that is testing fragile ties with neighbouring countries.

A United Nations-backed investigator has revealed disturbing evidence of “systemic torture” inside Myanmar’s detention centres, describing electric shocks, strangulations, gang rape and the burning of sexual body parts among the abuses that were documented over the past year.Nicholas Koumjian, head of the international independent team investigating atrocities in the country, spoke as the group released its latest annual report on Tuesday, covering the 12 months to 30 June.The country has been in turmoil since February 2021, ever since the army overthrew Aung San Suu Kyi’s elected government, sparking a civil war. As peaceful protests were crushed with lethal force, those opposing military rule took up arms.Since then, conflict has engulfed large parts of Myanmar.The investigative team, as quoted by AP, said that it had made progress in identifying security personnel involved in detention operations, as well as “perpetrators who have summarily executed captured combatants or civilians accused of being informers.”These perpetrators included members of the security forces, affiliated militias and opposition armed groups.The report details the ""documented torture in Myanmar’s detention facilities which includes beatings, electric shocks, strangulations, gang rape, burning of sexual body parts and other forms of sexual violence,"" according to a summary of the findings.“Our report highlights a continued increase in the frequency and brutality of atrocities committed in Myanmar,” Koumjian said. “We are working towards the day when the perpetrators will have to answer for their actions in a court of law.”“We have uncovered significant evidence, including eyewitness testimony, showing systematic torture in Myanmar detention facilities,” he further added.The team also launched new investigations into atrocities committed in Rakhine state, where the military and the Arakan Army, an opposition force, are battling for control.Rakhine has long been the scene of grave abuses.

An earthquake of 4.4 magnitude struck Afghanistan on Wednesday, according to the National Center for Seismology (NCS). The quake occurred at 2:24 pm IST, at a depth of 155 kilometers. The epicenter was located at latitude 36.51°N and longitude 70.70°E within the Afghan territory.This was the second quake recorded today, as seismic activity continues to affect the region. Earlier, a magnitude 4.2 earthquake struck at 12:19 pm IST. It occurred at a depth of 47 kilometers, with the epicenter located at latitude 36.54°N and longitude 71.52°E.This is the latest in a series of earthquakes to hit the region in recent days. On August 2, a stronger earthquake measuring 5.5 on the Richter scale struck Afghanistan at a depth of 87 kilometers. Prior to that, on July 29, a 4.8-magnitude earthquake was recorded at a shallow depth of just 10 kilometers.Shallow earthquakes are more dangerous than deep earthquakes. This is so because the seismic waves from shallow earthquakes have a shorter distance to travel to the surface, resulting in stronger ground shaking causing more damage to structures and greater casualties.According to the Red Cross, Afghanistan lies on several fault lines between the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates, particularly in the Hindu Kush mountain region, making it one of the most earthquake-prone areas in the world.The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA), Afghanistan warn that frequent quakes continue to pose a serious threat to communities in the country, which are already vulnerable due to decades of conflict and underdevelopment.The organization also noted that the country is highly vulnerable to natural disasters, including seasonal flooding, landslides and earthquakes.","An earthquake of 4.4 magnitude struck Afghanistan on Wednesday.

Bangladesh Interim Chief Yunus To Stay After Resignation Threat Amid Protests Over Rohingya Corridor

July Declaration unveiled:

Tight security and public celebration:





Bangladesh’s interim chief adviser and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus on Tuesday announced that the country’s next general elections will be held in February 2026, ahead of the holy month of Ramadan. He made the declaration during his address to the nation via state television, BTV and radio to mark the first anniversary of the mass uprising that ousted former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina ""On behalf of the interim government, I will write to the Chief Election Commissioner, requesting that the Election Commission organise a national election in February 2026, before the next Ramadan,"" Yunus said.The announcement marks a shift from his earlier indication that polls would be held in April. The revised timeline comes after consultations with major political parties, including the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) headed by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia which had called for earlier elections.""We will all begin mental preparation and institutional arrangements from tomorrow to complete all arrangements so that this year's election is memorable in the country's history in terms of joy and celebration, peace and order, voter turnout, and cordiality,"" he added.Yunus urged political parties to ensure that youth and women are not excluded from their manifestos or future governance plans. ""Remember, the youth who have changed Bangladesh have the power to change the world as well,"" he said.Earlier today, the interim government had also formally released the ""July Declaration"", a 26-point document outlining proposed reforms in governance, constitutional and political issues.Top leaders from political groups such as the BNP, Jamaat-e-Islami, and the newly formed National Citizen Party (NCP) were present during the official unveiling at the Bangladesh Parliament Complex, commemorating the uprising anniversary.The declaration sharply criticized the 1972 Constitution after its independence war against Pakistan in 1971, calling for reforms aligned with the will of the people.""Whereas, the post-independence Awami League government failed to materialise the people's aspirations because of the weaknesses in the procedures of drafting and in the structure of the constitution, along with its inappropriate application,"" the July Declaration said.It also condemned Sheikh Hasina’s administration, accusing it of turning Bangladesh into a fascist, mafia and failed state through alleged authoritarian rule and human rights violations.""Whereas, during the rule of Sheikh Hasina, under her very leadership, an extreme force that was anti-people, autocratic and against human rights turned Bangladesh into a fascist, mafia and failed state and thereby tarnished Bangladesh's international image,"" it added.The document calls for the 2024 uprising to be given official recognition and proposes that the July Declaration be included in a reformed constitution.Tens of thousands gathered at Manik Mia Avenue in Dhaka to mark the anniversary of Hasina’s ouster. The government declared the day a national holiday. Security was heightened across the capital, with police checkpoints and patrols in sensitive areas.Sheikh Hasina, who had been in power for 15 years, fled to India in August last year following mass protests. Her party, the Awami League, has since been banned by the interim administration, and its registration has been revoked by the Election Commission, effectively barring it from contesting in future polls unless the ban is lifted.Meanwhile, Human Rights Watch (HRW) raised concerns over the interim government's progress on human rights.""The hope of the thousands who braved lethal violence a year ago when they opposed Sheikh Hasina's abusive rule to build a rights-respecting democracy remains unfulfilled,"" said Meenakshi Ganguly, deputy Asia director at HRW.She warned that the interim leadership is struggling to balance security reform with pressures from hardliners and rival political factions.As the nation reflects on the events of the past year, Bangladesh remains on high alert. The month of August also marks the anniversary of the 1975 assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the country’s founding figure and Hasina’s father.","Bangladesh's interim chief adviser and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus announced that the country’s next general elections will be held in February 2026.

A newly formed political party led by students who played a key role in the anti-government protests that led to the ouster of former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina held a rally in the country's capital Dhaka on Sunday, pledging to build a new Bangladesh amid ongoing political uncertainty surrounding the next national election, reported news agency AP.The National Citizen Party, formed by the organisers of last year’s protests, gathered near the Shaheed Minar monument with around 1,000 supporters. Party leader Nahid Islam announced a 24-point agenda and called for the creation of a new constitution to replace the one adopted in 1972.“Exactly one year ago, at this Shaheed Minar (memorial), we vowed to free this country from the hands of dictatorship. By responding to that call, we together defeated the fascist rule and regained control of our country,” Islam said.“Let us all unite and transform this historic 24-point agenda into reality to build a new Bangladesh, a Bangladesh that fulfills the dreams of all citizens, as we move toward the formation of our second republic,” he added, as quoted by the agency.The party did not provide specific details on the proposed constitution but said its goal was to reflect the aspirations of a new generation of Bangladeshis.Separately, the student wing of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) also held a large rally in Dhaka.BNP acting chairman Tarique Rahman, who has been in exile in London since 2008, addressed the crowd virtually and urged supporters to mobilise young voters ahead of the upcoming polls, according to AP.Rahman said, “We must reclaim our democratic rights and engage the youth in shaping Bangladesh’s future.”The rallies took place two days before the interim government, led by Nobel peace prize laureate Muhammad Yunus is set to mark the first anniversary of Sheikh Hasina’s departure from power.Hasina fled to India on August 5, 2024, following weeks of mass protests and political unrest that resulted in hundreds of deaths and thousands of injuries. Yunus assumed office on August 8.The demonstrations come amid criticism of the interim government’s handling of law and order, with opposition parties accusing it of failing to contain mob violence and uphold human rights.With Hasina’s Awami League banned and the political future still unclear, the rallies highlighted the growing activity among both new and established political forces ahead of the next election.","National Citizen Party, formed by the organisers of last year’s protests, gathered near the Shaheed Minar monument with around 1,000 supporters.

SAN FRANCISCO: The Trump administration has reached an agreement with Britain to spare Apple from a request that the company create a tool to give British law enforcement organisations access to customers' cloud data.Tulsi Gabbard, US director of national intelligence, said Monday night that Britain had ""agreed to drop its mandate for Apple to provide a 'back door' that would have enabled access to the protected encrypted data of American citizens and encroached on our civil liberties.""Britain's decision to back off the policy comes after Apple spent months lobbying officials in Washington and rolled back an encrypted storage feature for British users. In the face of govt pressure around the world, the company has been resolute that it won't create a back door that allows access to phones or encrypted user data because it is afraid such a tool could be abused.Much of Apple's predicament in Britain played out in private after the govt issued a secret order this year. The request came after Britain amended its Investigatory Powers Act of 2016, which allows it to compel companies to turn over data and communications to law enforcement and intelligence agencies.Apple helped make the secret order public by declaring in Feb that iPhone users in Britain would begin seeing messages on their phones saying the company no longer offered its Advanced Data Protection feature. The capability, which remained available in the US, had allowed British users to encrypt almost all of their iCloud data, including messages,notes, photos and backups.Gabbard said Britain's agreement would ""ensure Americans' private data remains private and our Constitutional rights and civil liberties are protected."" nyt",Britain dropped a request for Apple to create a tool to give law enforcement access to customers' cloud data.

Royal Navy gets its first Hindu chaplain,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/royal-navy-gets-its-first-hindu-chaplain/articleshow/123394957.cms,"The UK's Royal Navy has appointed Bhanu Attri as its first-ever Hindu chaplain. (PTI Photo)





LONDON: A pandit raised in India has become the Royal Navy’s first ever Hindu chaplain.Bhanu Attri (39), who grew up in Himachal Pradesh but now lives in Essex, formally passed out of Britannia Royal Naval College in Dartmouth last week and is also the Royal Navy’s first non-Christian chaplain.He was one of two chaplains and 148 new Royal Navy officers to pass out.Chaplains offer religious, pastoral, welfare and moral support to any member of the naval service, regardless of faith, who need it either at a base, or on ships and submarines. Attri, a Hindu priest with decades of experience running a Hindu temple in London, will also offer Hindu prayer ceremonies for Hindus.There are around 40 Hindu personnel serving full-time in the Royal Navy, plus another 30 in the Maritime Reserves. In the UK military, as a whole, there are more than 1,550 Hindus serving full-time, mostly in the army.Whilst most cadets underwent 29 weeks of training, he underwent a slightly different 13-week course: six weeks of officer instruction, which included learning about the Royal Navy’s worldwide role, its present-day mission, and how to survive a sinking ship; four weeks at sea, and three weeks focused on the role of a military chaplain.Bhanu will now join the chaplaincy at HMS Drake, serving the thousands of personnel working in and around Devonport Naval Base, ashore and at sea.“Passing out from Britannia Royal Naval College to become the first ever Hindu chaplain in the fleet is a profound honour,” Attri said. “The chance to represent individuals from other diverse religions brings meaningful representation for the Hindu community and reflects the Navy’s commitment to diversity, inclusion, and spiritual care for all. My family feels immense pride.”Anil Bhanot, Hindu adviser to the ministry of defence (MoD), said: “In 2023 the Royal Navy created a position for a Hindu chaplain and I endorsed Pandit Bhanu Prakash Attri for best fitting the criteria. He has qualifications from India equivalent to a Sanskrit scriptural postgraduate degree.” Bhanot said he wanted to encourage more Hindu youth to join the British armed forces.“Although our spiritual Bhoomi is India, our Karma-Bhoomi is the UK and MoD represents our protective arm,” he said.","Bhanu Attri (39), who grew up in Himachal Pradesh but now lives in Essex, formally passed out of Britannia Royal Naval College in Dartmouth last week.

LONDON: A man has been convicted of causing grievous bodily harm with intent for his role in the shooting of a nine-year-old Keralite girl when she was eating ice-cream with her family in a restaurant in Dalston.The girl was hit in the head by the first of six bullets fired from a passing stolen motorcycle at a Turkish restaurant at 9.20 pm on May 29, 2024. She was caught up in a gangland shooting.Javon Riley (33) of Tottenham, London, was also found guilty by a jury at the Old Bailey of attempting to murder three men — Mustafa Kiziltan (35) Kenan Aydogdu (45) and Nasser Ali (44) — who were sitting outside Evin Restaurant. The three men were the intended targets. All four were taken to hospital for emergency surgery.The men had affiliations with Hackney Turks and the shooting was ordered by the Tottenham Turks, a rival gang, the court heard. Both gangs are responsible for importing most of the UK’s heroin.The girl has been left permanently injured with a titanium plate in her skull and a bullet still in her brain. She was in hospital for three months and will continue to have physical and cognitive difficulties throughout her life.Her parents hail from Kerala’s Ernakulam district and moved to Birmingham three years ago for work. Following the verdict her mother said: “This was not just an accident — even if our daughter was not the intended target, those responsible were still attempting to take lives, it is brutal and inhumane. We live with this pain every day, knowing nothing will ever be the same for our family.”Riley denied the charges but was convicted on Monday following a three-week trial. He did not pull the trigger but scoped out the area over several days, which included drinking pina coladas at the bar opposite. On the night of the attack, he travelled past the scene several times in a stolen car to ensure the targets were present and helped the gunman evade capture. The gunman and firearm have never been found. Detectives are offering up to £15,000 (Rs 17 lakh) for information that leads to the gunman. Riley, who is not a member of Tottenham Turks, refused to name the gunman or the person who ordered the shooting fearing for his safety.He will be sentenced on Sep 12.","Javon Riley (33) of Tottenham, London, was also found guilty by a jury at the Old Bailey of attempting to murder three men.

"‘Crushing cost’: UK parents skip meals, forego heating to afford school uniforms",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/crushing-cost-uk-parents-skip-meals-forego-heating-to-afford-school-uniforms-survey/articleshow/123384048.cms,"Representative AI image





A survey has found that parents in England are skipping meals and relying on buy-now-pay-later services like Klarna to cover the cost of school uniforms ahead of the autumn term.The survey, conducted by parenting charity Parentkind, found that many parents were being pushed into debt to afford school uniforms. Nearly half (45 percent) of respondents said they planned to use credit cards, while a third (34 percent) expected to rely on services such as Klarna.Of the 2,000 parents surveyed, nearly half (47 percent) expressed concern over the high cost of school uniforms, often running into hundreds of pounds for branded items. More than a quarter (29 percent) reported skipping food or heating to meet the cost.Education secretary Bridget Phillipson has called on schools to urgently ease the burden on struggling parents by cutting back on mandatory branded uniform items, ahead of an upcoming change in the law.“School uniform matters, but it shouldn’t break the bank. No family should have to choose between putting food on the table and buying a new blazer,” said Bridget Phillipson as quoted by the Guardian.“Parents have told us they want fewer costly branded items, and that’s exactly what we’re delivering. Schools can help ease the pressure on families right now by reducing the number of branded items they require.” Philllipson added.From September 2026, schools in the UK will be limited to three branded items, plus a branded tie for secondary and middle schools, under the government’s Children and Schools Bill. However, Phillipson has urged parents to adopt the changes earlier on a voluntary basis.The new legislation will allow parents to purchase basic uniform items, such as shirts and trousers, from general retailers like Aldi and Marks and Spencer.At present, schools can require parents to purchase multiple logo-branded items from specialist suppliers, with some demanding more than five, and in certain cases up to 10, pushing total uniform costs to as much as £400 when PE kits are included.“Parents have faced the crushing cost of sending their children to school for far too long. For many families the bills soar into the thousands every year, covering uniforms, books, stationery, trips, laptops and travel. These reforms are the first real step towards ending that injustice,” Parentkind’s chief executive Jason Elsom was quoted as saying by the Guardian.“Limiting branded school uniform items will make a difference straight away. Our research shows 85% of parents believe this will cut costs, 71% prefer to buy plain items and add the logo later, and 83% say unbranded uniform is just as good quality. This is about keeping money in parents’ pockets without sacrificing school pride,” Elsom said.Almost 9 in 10 parents (86 percent) of children aged between 4 to 15 in state schools in England said branded uniforms made no difference to a student’s behavior, as per the survey conducted.",Parents in England are skipping meals and relying on buy-now-pay-later services like Klarna to cover the cost of school uniforms.

Prince William & Kate Middleton's ‘Forever Home’ Dream Leaves Neighbours Homeless





Princess Anne turned 75 on August 15. To mark the day, the Prince and Princess of Wales posted a short birthday wish and shared her newly released portrait of the Princess Royal. Their message read, “Wishing Her Royal Highness The Princess Royal a very Happy 75th Birthday!”The image is part of a set released for the milestone. Shot at Gatcombe Park by John Swannell, the portrait keeps the tone formal and restrained—very Anne. Swannell has photographed her across multiple milestone birthdays, a continuity that suits the Princess Royal’s preference for understatement.There was also an earlier portrait released the week before: a two-shot of Anne with Sir Tim Laurence , taken at Windsor Castle by Chris Jackson ahead of July’s French state banquet. That image drew attention to a sleeker, pulled-back hairstyle, a look Anne also wore at the banquet with her longtime Festoon Tiara.The post from William and Kate landed during the family’s summer break, but the message stayed classic: a clear portrait, a brief line, and no long caption. It matches Anne’s public style and allows the picture to do the talking.As ever, the focus around her birthday was service. Anne is widely cited as one of the monarchy’s hardest-working royals, and official birthday coverage emphasized her decades of engagements and patronages.Family figured in the week’s imagery, too. The Windsor channels highlighted Anne and Sir Tim’s quiet partnership, as well as archival moments from her life—reminders of a career defined by duty, sport and charity more than spectacle.Why does a single post matter? It shows how the Wales household and the Princess Royal present milestones now: warm but minimal, with the visuals carrying the sentiment. For Anne, the emphasis stays on the work rather than the social-media flourish.As the summer break continues, the family is expected to spend time together in Scotland, with no indication of a large public event for the occasion. For the Princess Royal, a steady calendar and a modest celebration remain the norm—and the Waleses’ short message matched that mood.The takeaway: a milestone birthday, a clean portrait, and a brief wish from nephew and niece-in-law—small gestures that say plenty about how Princess Anne works, and how the royal family marks personal events today.","Princess Anne turned 75 on August 15.

London Mayor Sadiq Khan said he is willing to meet US President Donald Trump and would be “more than happy to meet” him, even as he warned that Trump’s words could “inadvertently radicalize people” and that he is “not a force for good.”The Labour politician dismissed Trump’s recent personal attacks, made during the US President’s visit to Scotland, in which Trump called Khan “a nasty person” who had “done a terrible job.” Khan described such comments as “water off a duck’s back”.However, speaking at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, he admitted that the exchanges sometimes made him feel “nine years old again” and like he was “in the school playground,” as reported by the Independent.During the event, Khan had criticised Trump’s views on women, black people, LGBTQ+ individuals, Muslims and Mexicans.“Somebody who has views like he does about black people, about women, about gays, about Muslims, about Mexicans, thinks I’m nasty. Really. He is the leader of the free world, arguably the most powerful man in the world, and really.”Khan highlighted that since Trump began his second term in January, record numbers of Americans have applied for British citizenship and moved to London.“So I think Americans have got good taste by and large,” he said.He hoped that Trump would visit London during his upcoming state visit to the UK, emphasizing that the city’s diversity is a “strength, not a weakness.” Speaking about diversity, he added, “I think it makes us stronger not weaker, richer not poorer.""The London mayor warned that President Trump’s words can push extreme views into the mainstream and become potentially dangerous. He may unintentionally radicalize people, prompting harmful actions.Khan also highlighted that minorities in London could face discrimination because of the Trump’s statements. He accused US President of “using London and our diversity as a political football, as a proxy for a culture war.”Despite his criticisms, Khan said he would be “more than happy to meet President Trump”.The Labour politician said, “I suspect President Trump may have formed a view of Muslims because of the actions of a small minority of really bad people who are terrorists and use Islam in a perverted way.“What I would want President Trump to know is that is a very small fraction of Muslims across the globe. So if there was an opportunity to meet President Trump, I would be more than happy to do so.”","London Mayor Sadiq Khan said he is willing to meet US President Donald Trump.

LONDON: A multi-million pound conservation programme in England helped save 150 struggling species but ""time is running out"" to halt the decline, the head of Natural England, which led the initiative, said Wednesday.The public body, responsible for protecting and enhancing England's natural environment, invested a £13 million ($17.6 million) grant in efforts to support animal and plant species such as water vole, oystercatcher, lady's slipper orchid, the hazel dormouse and Atlantic salmon.""From the Lizard Peninsula in Cornwall to Cumbria and Northumberland, 63 different projects involving 78 partners have transformed landscapes and supported the recovery of 150 species, many of which were on the brink of national extinction, through research, captive breeding, habitat creation, and conservation translocations,"" the body said in a statement released Wednesday.More than 15,000 individual animals and plants were translocated to expand species territories under the projects, which ran from August 2023 to March 2025.Notable successes include the reintroduction of black grouse to the North Yorkshire Moors, northern England, and the return of the large marsh grasshopper to the Norfolk Broads in east England after an 85-year absence.Despite the achievements, the chair of Natural England Tony Juniper warned more needed to be done.""A rising number of nature recovery projects, both large and small, are making a huge difference up and down the country,"" he said in the press release.""We know we can turn round species decline and improve ecosystems with the right targeted actions, the drive and the funding.

The boy was acquitted of murder but convicted of manslaughter in April and sentenced in June.Kohli, an active and fit man who was held in high regard by the local community, was killed on Sept 1, 2024 while walking his dog in a Leicestershire park. The boy, then aged 14, put on a balaclava, knocked him to the ground, then hit him round the head with his slider shoe as he was on his knees trying to get up as a girl he was with, then aged 12, laughed and filmed the attack on her mobile.The boy attacked Kohli a second time near the park exit, punching and kicking him, breaking three ribs. He died later in hospital.The sentencing was enhanced due to aggravating factors which included the boy calling Kohli a “Paki”. Kohli was born in Punjab, India.Bhatia argued that calling Kohli a “Paki” was at the lower end of the scale of racism and the addition to the sentence was excessive. The court heard the boy’s sentence was half what an adult would get.Lady Justice Macur said: “We understand that not only his family but the public too were shocked at the lenient sentence of 7 years. However , the sentencing of children and young people for serious offences is complex. Many are not fully developed and may not understand the pain they cause to victims. The court must bear in mind the principle is to prevent offending and the welfare of the child. We do not find the sentence unduly lenient. ”She rejected the argument that adding six months to the sentence for racial aggravating factors was excessive and praised Kohli’s “sunny disposition” and “enjoyment of life” to his family who were in court.","Court of Appeal judges refuse to increase the seven-year sentence given to a 15-year-old boy for killing much-loved British Indian grandfather Bhim Kohli.

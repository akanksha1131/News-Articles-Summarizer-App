8 extrajudicial killings in first 52 days of Bangladesh interim government,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/8-extrajudicial-killings-in-first-52-days-of-bangladesh-interim-government/articleshow/115374341.cms,"DHAKA: Bangladesh-based human rights organisation Odhikar has documented that at least eight people were victims of extrajudicial killings between August 9 and September 30 following the assumption of power in Dhaka by the interim government led by Muhammad Yunus on August 8. The three-month human rights report for July-September was prepared by Odhikar based on reports sent by human rights activists affiliated with it and data published by news outlets.Of these eight victims, one died allegedly as a result of police torture, another from torture allegedly at the hands of the department of narcotics control, and three were tortured to death, allegedly by joint forces. Additionally, three people were shot dead by joint forces.From August 9 to September 30 at least 52 people were killed and 1,308 people injured in political violence, the report says.A total of 67 people were lynched between July and September. Of them, 36 were lynched from July 1 to August 5, and 31 from August 9 to September 30. From August 9 to September 30, however, no cases of alleged enforced disappearances were reported.According to statistics collected by Odhikar, between August 9 and September 30 four journalists were injured, two were assaulted, three threatened; cases were filed against three while they were carrying out their professional duties.The report says 1,581 people, including children, were killed and over 18,000 injured during the student-led mass uprising from July 1 to August 5, citing statistics from the Students Movement Against Discrimination and the Jatiya Nagorik Committee.","Human rights organisation Odhikar documented that at least eight people were victims of extrajudicial killings between August 9 and September 30.

North Korea deploys a new weapon against the South: Unbearable noise,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/north-korea-deploys-a-new-weapon-against-the-south-unbearable-noise/articleshow/115374236.cms,"DANGSAN-RI: Loud, crackly noises that sounded like an ominous, giant gong being beaten again and again washed over this village on a recent night. On other nights, some residents described hearing wolves howling, metal grinding together or ghosts screaming as if out of a horror movie. Others said they heard the sound of incoming artillery, or even a furious monkey pounding on a broken piano.Although they heard different sounds at different times, people in this South Korean village on the border with North Korea all call themselves victims of ""noise bombing,"" saying they find the relentless barrage exhausting.""It is driving us crazy,"" said An Mi-hee, 37. ""You can't sleep at night.""Since July, North Korea has amped up loudspeakers along its border with South Korea for 10 to 24 hours a day, broadcasting eerie noises that have aggravated South Korean villagers like no past propaganda broadcasts from the North ever did. The offensive is one of the most bizarre -- and unbearable -- consequences of deteriorating inter-Korean relations that have sunk to their lowest level in years under the North's leader, Kim Jong Un , and the South's president, Yoon Suk Yeol .For decades, the two Koreas -- which never signed a peace treaty after the 1950-53 Korean War ended in a truce -- have swung between conciliatory tones and saber rattling. Under Kim, Pyongyang has veered toward a more hawkish stance over the past few years. It has shut off all dialogue with Seoul and Washington, doubled down on testing nuclear-capable missiles and has vowed to treat South Korea not as a partner for reunification, but as an enemy that the North must annex should war break out.In the South, Yoon has also adopted a more confrontational approach since taking office in 2022. He has called for spreading the idea of freedom to the North to penetrate the information blackout Kim relies on to maintain his totalitarian rule. South Korea has also expanded joint military drills with the United States and Japan, which involved aircraft carriers, strategic bombers and stealth jets, to deter Kim.Complicating the global picture, North Korea this year strengthened its ties with Russia, shipping weapons and troops to aid its war against Ukraine and striking a mutual defense pact in the event either is attacked.The souring of ties is increasingly affecting the lives of people living along the Demilitarized Zone between North and South Korea, where Kim's growing hostilities toward the South have taken the form of noise bombardment.""It's bombing without shells,"" An said. As she spoke from her living room, the distant gong-like sounds outside raged on, the noise seeming to grow louder as the night deepened. ""The worst part is that we don't know when it will end, whether it will ever end.""An's village, Dangsan, has a population of 354, with most residents in their 60s and older. It has been one of the hardest hit by North Korea's psychological warfare. Sitting on the northern shore of Gwanghwa Island, west of Seoul, it is only a mile from North Korea, separated by a stretch of gray sea.""I wish they would just broadcast their old insults and propaganda songs,"" said An Seon-hoe, 67, another villager. ""At least they were human sounds and we could bear them.""Since the 1960s, loudspeakers have been as much a fixture of the DMZ as razor-wire fences and land-mine warning signs. People living along the border endured propaganda broadcasts as a part of frontier life, as the rival governments switched them on and off, depending on the political mood.When they were on, both sides insulted each other's leaders as ""puppets."" A female voice that drifted across the 2.5-mile-wide DMZ beckoned South Korean soldiers to defect to ""the people's paradise"" in the North. South Korean broadcasts tried to entice North Korean troops with sugary K-pop tunes.The latest bombardment from the North contains no human sound or music -- just nonstop noises that villagers find hard to describe, other than calling them ""irritating"" and ""stressful."" They have blamed them for insomnia, headaches, and even goats miscarrying, hens laying fewer eggs and the sudden death of a pet dog.The noise was part of a series of steps North Korea has taken to retaliate against what it called South Korean hostility. Recent events might explain why the sounds have become so intolerable.Since his negotiations with President Donald Trump collapsed in 2019, Kim has shifted the course of his country's external relations, turning increasingly hostile toward South Korea, in particular.Some analysts say that by raising tensions, Kim was building the case for why the next American president needed to engage with him as he seeks an easing of international sanctions in return for agreeing to contain his nuclear program. The impending return of Trump, who is now president-elect and with whom Kim met three times during his first term, could increase the chances of the two countries' engaging again after years of silence.But others say Kim's recent rhetoric toward the South reflected a fundamental shift, channeling his belief in the advent of a ""neo-cold war.""The catalyst for this change was waves of anti-Kim propaganda leaflets that were sent across the border via balloons by North Korean defectors living in the South, said Koh Yu-hwan, a former head of the Korea Institute for National Unification. These leaflets called Kim ""a murderous dictator"" or ""pig"" and urged North Koreans to overthrow his government.In May, North Korea retaliated by sending its own balloons to the South, loaded with trash in response to what Pyongyang called political ""filth"" from the South.Weeks later, South Korea ended a six-year hiatus in propaganda broadcasts, switching its loudspeakers back on to blast K-pop and news to the North. The North responded with its blasts of strange, nerve-racking noises.""North Korea knows its propaganda no longer works on South Koreans,"" said Kang Dong-wan, an expert on North Korea at Dong-A University in the South. ""The goal of its loudspeakers has changed from spreading propaganda to forcing South Korea to stop its own broadcasts and leaflets.""Until inter-Korean tensions caught up with them, Dangsan residents were proud of their quiet rural life despite their proximity to the border. They grew red peppers and thick radishes in their gardens. Cats sauntered under persimmon trees strung with heavy fruits. Wild geese took off from harvested rice fields in a chorus of honking.These days, however, villagers keep their windows shut to minimize the noise from North Korea. Some have installed Styrofoam over them for extra insulation. Children no longer play on outdoor trampolines because of the noise.Political leaders have visited Dangsan to offer their sympathies. During a parliamentary hearing last month, a teary An Mi-hee knelt before lawmakers, asking for a solution. But officials suggested neither a plan to de-escalate the psychological war with the North nor a solution to the noise, villagers said, other than offering double-pane windows for villagers and medication for their livestock to better endure the stress caused by the noise.""The solution is for the two Koreas to recommit themselves to their old agreements not to slander each other,"" said Koh, of the Korea Institute. But things have only worsened. Last month, North Korea demolished all railway and road links between the two Koreas with dynamite. This month, it disrupted GPS signals near the western border with the South, affecting some civilian ship and air traffic, according to the South Korean military.Residents near the border have grown weary of ebbs and flows of tensions on the peninsula. An's father, An Hyo-cheol, 67, the village chief of Dangsan, urged the South Korean government to stop what some villagers called a ""childish"" shoving match with the North. He demanded that the Yoon administration stop all propaganda broadcasts and ban leaflets, to encourage the North to follow suit.Dangsan residents said they were being sacrificed in the uncompromising political rivalry between the two Koreas.""The government has abandoned us because we are small in number and mostly old people,"" said Park Hae-sook, 75, a villager. ""I can't imagine the government doing nothing if Seoul suffered the same noise attack as we have.""Shortly after she spoke, the afternoon offensive started with faint metallic howls coming across the border.","Since July, North Korea has amped up loudspeakers along its border with South Korea. The eerie noises have aggravated South Korean villagers like no past propaganda broadcasts. The offensive is one of the most bizarre -- and unbearable -- consequences of deteriorating relations.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115374258,imgsize-404984,width-400,resizemode-4/115374258.jpg"
"Slash first, fix later: How Elon Musk prefers to cut costs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/slash-first-fix-later-how-elon-musk-prefers-to-cut-costs/articleshow/115374208.cms,"On a Saturday morning in December 2022, Elon Musk summoned finance executives at Twitter, which he had bought six weeks earlier, to a conference call. Then he drilled into a spreadsheet that contained the social media company's expenditures.Musk was angry, three people who were on the call said. Even though Twitter had just shed more than three-quarters of its employees - leaving it with just over 1,500 workers, down from nearly 8,000 - the company's spending still appeared to be out of control, the billionaire told attendees.Over the next six hours, Musk read out the spreadsheet line by line and asked workers to account for each item. He ordered some items - such as car services for executives - to be cut. At one point, he confronted an employee who was responsible for a multimillion-dollar contract related to website security and said his electric vehicle company, Tesla, spent far less on the same task. After the employee pushed back, Musk said she was no longer with Twitter.Frugal to a fault, the 53-year-old has been intimately involved in hacking down budgets at his companies, including Tesla, SpaceX and Twitter, which he renamed X. Perhaps most importantly, Musk has been unsentimental about the cuts, paying little regard to conventions. ""He used to be a deity,"" said Jim Cantrell, SpaceX's first VP of business development. ""But you know he's a business guy. He wants to cut everything to the bone.""Now Musk, with a net worth over $307 billion, is set to take his economising tactics to the federal govt. At a Trump rally in Oct, Musk promised to eliminate $2 trillion, or 30%, from the annual US budget.From his earliest days as a tech entrepreneur, Musk was allergic to costs. In 1995, after establishing his first business in Silicon Valley - a software company for newspapers called Zip2 - he slept in the office to avoid paying for an apartment and showered at a nearby YMCA.At SpaceX, he stripped out unnecessary components from rocket parts, simplifying them in a way that made them cheaper and faster to manufacture. Cantrell said he had once told Musk that the fuel tanks on the first rockets would cost $1 million or more. ""It so offended Elon,"" Cantrell said. SpaceX ultimately bought rolls of steel and welded pieces to build its own tanks for a few hundred thousand dollars.In 2010, SpaceX launched its Falcon 9 rocket, which costs about $550 million in inflation-adjusted dollars to manufacture. It is used for all of SpaceX's commercial launches. Nasa has estimated that the same system would have cost it as much as $4 billion to build. Musk's frugality not only saved SpaceX money but also created a commercial space boom. Getting a kilogram of cargo to orbit today costs about $2,600, compared with $65,000 on now-retired Nasa shuttle.At Tesla, his low-cost tactics helped make the company's electric vehicles profitable, while rivals lose money on every EV they sell.","Musk, 53, has been intimately involved in hacking down budgets at his companies, including Tesla, SpaceX and Twitter, which he renamed X.

Chinese President Xi Jinping on Saturday pledged to work with the incoming administration of US President-elect Donald Trump , highlighting the importance of maintaining stability in US-China relations His remarks came during a meeting with outgoing US President Joe Biden on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) forum in Lima, Peru. This marked their first meeting in seven months, as both leaders addressed critical global issues, including trade disputes, cybercrimes, tensions over Taiwan , and the ongoing influence of Russia.Xi acknowledged the historical challenges between the two nations but reiterated China’s consistent aim of fostering a stable, healthy, and sustainable relationship with the US, adding that Beijing is ready to maintain communication, expand cooperation, and manage differences with the Trump administration. Biden noted the frank and candid nature of his discussions with Xi, highlighting the importance of dialogue even in times of disagreement.The meeting occurred amid heightened tensions, as Trump prepared to take office in two months. His campaign promises, including imposing 60% tariffs on Chinese imports under his “America First” trade agenda, have already caused unease in Beijing.Biden’s administration has attempted to manage multiple flashpoints in the relationship, including allegations of China-linked cyberattacks targeting US government communications, growing pressure on Taiwan, and Beijing’s support for Russia in the Ukraine conflict.Meanwhile, Taiwan’s leadership has been a source of contention, with reports of President Lai Ching-te planning sensitive stopovers in the US and former economy minister Lin Hsin-i inviting Biden to visit Taiwan, moves likely to provoke Beijing. China continues to view Taiwan as its territory, while the US remains its most significant international backer, supplying arms despite lacking formal diplomatic ties.Beijing’s economy has faced significant challenges due to US trade policies under Biden, including restrictions on investments in Chinese technology sectors like artificial intelligence and quantum computing, as well as export controls on advanced semiconductors. These measures have compounded domestic pressures, creating economic strains that loom large over bilateral discussions.As Xi outlined the potential paths forward, he stressed that mutual respect and cooperation could foster progress in the relationship, while antagonism and competition would risk setbacks.Xi’s visit to the Apec summit also marked a broader diplomatic push to expand China’s influence in Latin America, a region long dominated by US interests. During his trip, Xi signed a refurbished free-trade agreement with Peru, inaugurated the Chancay deep-water port, and announced plans to host the Apec summit in 2026.","Xi Jinping pledged to work with the incoming administration of US President- elect Donald Trump.

A whistleblower report on the U.S. government's secret UAP (Unidentified Aerial Phenomena) program was made public, sparking a renewed discussion about the existence of extraterrestrial life and the potential government cover-ups surrounding these phenomena. The report, titled Immaculate Constellation, was released by Representative Nancy Mace and presented during a Congressional hearing held on the same day.The hearing was titled “Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth”, and it addressed several pressing questions about UAPs: Are we being observed by intelligent extraterrestrial life? Has the U.S. government been concealing evidence about UAPs? Has the government recovered any non-human biological materials from UAPs? And most critically, does the U.S. possess any UAPs?In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Representative Mace raised pointed questions: “If UAPs don’t exist, why are taxpayer dollars being spent on something that isn’t real? And if they do exist, why is this information being deliberately hidden from the public?” These questions set the stage for an intense session where whistleblowers testified, some making alarming claims about the U.S. government's handling of UAP data and technology.The hearing featured testimony from four key figures—Luis Elizondo, a former Department of Defense official; Tim Gallaudet, a retired rear admiral of the U.S. Navy; Michael Shellenberger, a journalist and founder of Public news outlet; and Michael Gold, a former NASA official. All four agreed that the U.S. government is deliberately concealing information about UAPs. They suggested that certain UAPs could represent non-human intelligence and that the U.S. might possess advanced technologies that are not of this world.At a recent UAP hearing , Luis Elizondo, a key advocate for UAP transparency, firmly stated that ""UAPs are real"" and described how these phenomena, potentially linked to non-human intelligence, are monitoring sensitive military sites globally. He argued that the U.S. government has recovered UAP technologies, and other nations may possess them, while criticising the secrecy surrounding UAP programs.Retired Navy rear admiral Tim Gallaudet shared his 2015 encounter with a UAP during a naval exercise, highlighting the ""Go Fast"" video that showed an object exhibiting flight characteristics beyond known military technology. He emphasised that key UAP information is hidden in classified programs.Journalist Michael Shellenberger referred to comments by Presidents Trump and Obama, both suggesting the U.S. government holds undisclosed UAP information. He called for bipartisan transparency, arguing that the public has a right to know the truth, especially if UAPs pose a national security threat.Michael Gold, a former NASA official, highlighted the stigma that has long surrounded discussions of UAPs. He called on government agencies and the scientific community to overcome this stigma and open up to the possibility of scientific inquiry into the nature of UAPs. Gold echoed the famous phrase, “The truth is out there,” urging society to be brave enough to confront the possibility that humanity might not be alone in the universe.The 2024 hearing on Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs) built on earlier testimonies from military figures, including retired Navy pilot Ryan Graves and intelligence officer David Grusch, who had previously shared their experiences with UAPs.Graves, a former F/A-18 pilot, described multiple encounters with UAPs exhibiting advanced capabilities like supersonic speeds and the ability to hover in strong winds. He highlighted an incident in 2014 near Virginia Beach, where he and other pilots observed a mysterious object — a dark grey or black cube within a clear sphere — performing impossible manoeuvres. Graves raised concerns about underreporting and the withholding of critical information on these phenomena.David Grusch, a retired intelligence officer who had worked on the UAP task force, made explosive claims, stating that the U.S. government possessed crashed UAPs and potentially non-human biological material. Grusch revealed that he had interviewed over 40 witnesses and uncovered a multi-decade program focused on retrieving and reverse-engineering UAPs. He also suggested that some individuals had been harmed or threatened to suppress information on these technologies.Retired Navy Commander David Fravor recounted his famous 2004 encounter with a Tic-Tac-shaped UAP off the coast of California, which was later captured in Pentagon-released footage. Fravor described the UAP as having no visible flight controls and performing impossible manoeuvres, travelling at extreme speeds and defying the laws of physics. He emphasised that the object’s capabilities far surpassed anything the U.S. military currently possesses, suggesting it was not from any known nation.Fravor also emphasised that the technology witnessed in the Tic-Tac incident could represent a potential national security threat, given its capabilities far exceeded anything that the U.S. military possessed at the time. Fravor expressed awe at the object's performance but also voiced serious concerns about what it might mean for national security, warning that the technology involved could be far beyond anything the U.S. or its adversaries currently control.The testimonies of these whistleblowers, along with the release of the Immaculate Constellation report, have reignited public interest in UAPs and their potential implications for national security. While many of the questions surrounding these phenomena remain unanswered, the hearing underscored the growing demand for transparency and for the U.S. government to declassify critical data about UAPs. The revelations have set the stage for what could be a significant shift in our understanding of not just UAPs, but also the broader cosmic context in which humanity exists. The truth, as these whistleblowers have insisted, may well be out there—waiting to be uncovered.","The 2024 hearing on Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs) built on earlier testimonies from military figures, including retired Navy pilot Ryan Graves and intelligence officer David Grusch. The hearing featured testimony from four key figures—Luis Elizondo, a former Department of Defense official; Tim Gallaudet, a retired rear admiral of the U.S. Navy; Michael Shellenberger, a journalist and founder of Public news outlet; and Michael Gold, a ex-NASA official. All four agreed that the government is deliberately concealing information about UAPs.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115327812,imgsize-17608,width-400,resizemode-4/115327812.jpg"

Donald Trump: 'Left scored own goal by its embrace of a form of minoritarian identity politics',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/left-scored-own-goal-by-its-embrace-of-a-form-of-minoritarian-identity-politics/articleshow/115368010.cms,"German American political scientist Yascha Mounk has spent many years analysing the rise of far-right ideologies across the globe. However, in his latest book ‘ Identity Trap ’, he turns the mirror on the excesses of the left. In a conversation with Shruti Sonal, Mounk talks about the reasons for Trump ’s win





Your new book critiques the identity-driven politics of the left. Can you elaborate?

One of your key arguments is that the left is adopting ‘progressive separatism’. Is the rise of leaders like Donald Trump a backlash against it?



Is liberalism coming apart globally, as many commentators have pointed out?

After Trump’s victory, liberals have been very despondent about the future of America. Are you in the pessimist club too, or do you see lessons here for ‘woke’ politics?

The elections also threw light on the mistrust of mainstream media that’s bubbling up in many segments of society…

One of the ways I think about politics is in terms of our fundamental psychological instincts as humans. All of us have an instinct to draw boundaries between the ‘in group’ and the ‘out group’. We are capable of great altruism and generosity when we’re dealing with members of our ‘in group’, but we can also be very cruel and sometimes violent versus members of the ‘out group’. Majoritarian identity politics, which is usually perceived as being right wing, says it is fine for politicians to prioritise the interest of some communities with no concern for moral rights of others. What’s striking over the last decades is that big parts of the left have also embraced a form of minoritarian identity politics, in which they have come up with a new set of excuses for the same basic psychological mechanism. They’ve conceived a country as no longer consisting of citizens who share some amount of solidarity, irrespective of their origin or religion, but what some call a ‘community of communities’. Under that, your rights and obligations and perhaps your primary local solidarity should be to your ethnic or religious group. That is both a mistake in terms of the kind of society we should want to create and a big political own goal, which makes it easier for majoritarian politicians to win.I think so. It’s important to distinguish between different forms of identity politics, a term that is far too broad to be useful. In a sense, Frederick Douglass and Martin Luther King in the US, or Gandhi and Nehru in India, engaged in identity politics, but their vision was one of inclusivity. Of late, we’ve seen the rise of a form of identity politics that is separatist in a different way. One in which, for example, young school children are not taught to see beyond the differences to be friends with each other, irrespective of the origins. It affects your ability to be admitted to university, your ability to advance in your job, your ability to access medical care. One of the striking things about this is that while this is popular among a small segment of highly educated white people in the US, it turns out to be quite unpopular among most members of minority communities. The real reason why Trump won is that he made significant progress in the vote share of African Americans and Asian Americans, particularly of Latinos.The thing about liberalism is that very few people have an ability to articulate exactly what those values entail, or are sufficiently principled to prioritise those values over policy wins and other self-interests. But I also think that citizens in a great number of democracies have a deep sense of fairness and justice, which is part of a broader liberal culture. When somebody is discriminated against on the basis of which community they were born into, that’s something that shocks and outrages most people. They understand that if we give up on checks and balances and protections of due process that protect people against being punished in arbitrary ways, there is a genuine injustice.I think woke ideas do not appeal to more than 1/10th of the population even in places where they are most organic. They put forward fundamentally wrong visions of how to build thriving multi-ethnic or multi-religious democracies that people would actually be excited to live in. There’s a much better alternative. I think it’s possible to fight for inclusive progressive values on the basis of a much more broadly shared moral vision. So when I look at the US, I think Americans actually have a positive view of immigration, and think that greater ethnic diversity is a positive thing. Yet, most Americans also want very clear control of the border. Most of them are against discriminating against sexual minorities, including trans people. Yet, they also think that trans women who’ve undergone male puberty shouldn’t be allowed to compete in women’s sports. On all of those policy issues, giving up on this particular form of all politics doesn’t have to mean and it shouldn’t mean giving up on tolerant, inclusive politics that the left has historically cared about. It’s more about moving away from cancel culture and this preachy way of seeing society.As a member of the mainstream media, I have to say that part of the answer to this is that we screwed up too often. We uncritically treated as inadmissible opinions things that were not only shared by a big majority of the population, but often turned out to be correct. The US, for example, treated the idea that Covid-19 might have originated in a lab as a conspiracy theory and condemned anybody who tried to take seriously some of the costs that prolonged school closures might have on learning outcomes of children. They did not want to see the growing evidence that cross-sex operations for teenagers as young as 13 or 14 can come with very serious, lifelong medical complications.","German American political scientist Yascha Mounk has spent many years analysing the rise of far-right ideologies across the globe.

This is disgusting anti-Christian bigotry from the AP, and the entire organization should be ashamed of itself,” Vance wrote.While Hegseth has numerous tattoos, the controversy primarily centers around his “Deus Vult” tattoo on his arm. However, in the past, due to a tattoo on his chest, he was not allowed to work security at President Joe Biden's 2021 inauguration because military higher-ups believed the tattoo might be an extremist symbol.","Pete Hegseth, US President-elect Donald Trump's pick for secretary of defense, is facing criticism for his tattoos.

Music mogul Sean “Diddy” Combs has allegedly attempted to contact potential witnesses from jail and sway public opinion to influence jurors in his upcoming sex trafficking trial, prosecutors claimed in a Friday court filing, urging the judge to deny his latest bail request .Combs, currently held in a Brooklyn detention center, faces charges of coercion and abuse of women over several years.Prosecutors, in the court documents, outlined Combs’ alleged efforts to manipulate witnesses and public opinion from jail, including orchestrating social media campaigns. They said that a review of recorded calls revealed Combs instructing family members to influence witnesses' narratives and discussing marketing strategies to shape public perception.""The defendant has repeatedly shown — even while in custody — that he will flout rules to improperly impact the outcome of his case,"" prosecutors stated in the filing, adding that he ""cannot be trusted to abide by conditions.""Prosecutors alleged that Combs' behavior indicates an intent to manipulate victims and witnesses, arguing that he may be attempting to coerce them into remaining silent or giving testimony favorable to his defense.Prosecutors further claimed that Diddy began violating rules shortly after his arrival at the prison following his arrest in September.According to prosecutors, Combs involved his children in his efforts, encouraging them to post a birthday tribute video on social media, which he then analyzed for its potential impact on jurors.These actions, prosecutors argued, justify his continued detention and demonstrate a pattern of witness intimidation and manipulation of the legal process.Despite two prior bail requests being denied, Combs’ lawyers recently filed a third proposal, citing new evidence. However, prosecutors maintain that his alleged attempts to influence witnesses reflect a continued disregard for legal proceedings.A bail hearing is scheduled for next week, with Combs’ trial set to begin on May 5.","Diddy faces charges of coercion and abuse of women over several years.

Like it or Leavitt: Trump picks 27-year old as youngest WH Press Secretary in history,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/like-it-or-leavitt-trump-picks-27-year-old-as-youngest-wh-press-secretary-in-history/articleshow/115362743.cms,"TOI Correspondent from Washington:

The oldest man to win the US Presidency will have the youngest press secretary in White House history.MAGA supremo and President-elect Donald Trump on Friday named Karoline Leavitt , 27, as the White House press secretary , one of the most visible jobs in the world, continuing his rapid staffing of an administration that still has two months to go befoe assuming office.Leavitt, mother of a three-month old infant, worked most recently as his campaign press secretary after serving in his first term as an assistant to four White House press secretaries he cycled through. A former Fox News intern, she is known for her combative style and disdain for the mainstream liberal media she shares with Trump.Also read: Is Biden taller than Trump? White House photo sparks height discussions on social media “Karoline is smart, tough, and has proven to be a highly effective communicator,” Trump said in a statement announcing her promotion. “I have the utmost confidence she will excel at the podium, and help deliver our message to the American People as we, Make America Great Again.”Leavitt trumped other prospects like Trump's lawyer Alina Habba and his confidante Laura Loomer for the high-profile job that involves daily appearance -- if Trump wishes so -- on the White House press room lectern. During Trump's first term, weeks passed without a daily briefing as the MAGA supremo himself, never short of words, often took charge of the podium.Leavitt, a 2019 B.A graduate, ran for Congress in New Hampshire in 2022 and lost, adopting positions so far right that she was reportedly dubbed KKKaroline in the state's political circles. One MAGA fans described her ""everything the left hates, young, straight, blonde, Christian, beauty, brains and a mother!""Her nomination is in line with Trump's picks so far of MAGA loyalists regardless of age, experience, or qualifications, in an effort to break the stranglehold of the old school Washington establishment.Some of the nominees have already generated a backlash even within the Republican Party even as Democrats are apoplectic over what they see as an impending ""kakistocracy"" -- an administration staffed by the country's least suitable or competent citizens. Trump's picks for Defense Secretary and Attorney General have both been rocked by allegations of sexual misdemeanors, with doubts about whether they can pass a confirmation process.On Friday, reports surfaced that Pete Hegseth, Trump’s choice to lead the Defense Department, faced police investigation into allegations that he sexually assaulted a woman in a California hotel in 2017 after a Republican conference. The incident did not result in criminal charges. Trump's AG nominee Matt Gaetz faces even more lurid charges of underaged sex trafficking.The reports have alarmed Republican Senate grandees who would typically be tasked with confirming the nominees, but Trump has indicated he would simply work around the process with recess appointments, even as MAGA loyalists are ready to rubberstamp the appointments because they believe the President-elect has the mandate to do as he likes.","Karoline Leavitt, 27, will be the youngest press secretary in White House history.

Podcaster Joe Rogan claimed that President Joe Biden wanted Donald Trump to win the presidential election, suggesting he is happy to see Democratic nominee and Vice President Kamala Harris lose the polls.This week, Joe Rogan looking at one of the photos of Biden and Trump's meeting on Wednesday in the White House said that the president must have voted for Trump as he was so happy.""Do you know what one of my f***ing favorite things of this whole election cycle has been? Yesterday when Biden and Trump sat down in the White House,"" Rogan said. ""Biden voted for Trump. I guarantee it. I f***ing guarantee it. I never saw that dude so happy in his f***ing life. He lost. His party lost. He was happy.""Rogan drew a distinction between this meeting and the 2016 encounter between then-President Obama and Trump, noting Obama's apparent weariness at that time.Upon viewing an image of a smiling Biden alongside Trump, Rogan responded enthusiastically: ""Look at, look at Biden! Look at his f***ing smile, dude! Look at his f***ing smile, man. That's like when your kid gets married.""The podcaster suggested Biden's apparent happiness stemmed from Harris's electoral defeat, referencing an incident where the president wore a Trump cap during campaign activities.""I guarantee you, I guarantee you that mother****er was happy. He had a giant smile on his face. He said, 'Welcome back' to him,"" he commented.This stands in contrast to Biden's previous statements describing Trump as ""a threat to democracy"" and warning about democratic institutions being at risk under Trump's leadership, Fox News reported.Observers have noted Biden's more conciliatory approach following the election, marking a significant shift from his earlier stance.","Joe Rogan claimed that President Joe Biden wanted Donald Trump to win the presidential election.

Speaking at the Margalla Dialogue 2024 in Islamabad, called for comprehensive regulations to curb the spread of false and misleading information, which he said destabilises political and social structures.“Unrestricted freedom of speech is leading to the degradation of moral values in all societies,” General Munir remarked during the event, organised by the Islamabad Policy Research Institute.Addressing the rapid growth of technology, Munir noted its dual impact on society. While it has revolutionised access to information, it has also facilitated the proliferation of disinformation and hate speech. He warned that without robust laws to regulate online content, the consequences could be dire.“False and misleading information poses a major challenge. Without comprehensive laws, hate speech and misinformation will continue to destabilise societies,” he said.The general’s comments come as Pakistan grapples with increasing misuse of social media platforms. Munir has previously spoken out against ""digital terrorism,"" where online critics are accused of spreading falsehoods targeting the armed forces and other institutions. He emphasised the need to verify information to prevent public unrest and uphold societal harmony.Earlier this year, Munir had stated, ""The Constitution provides for freedom of speech but also outlines clear limits to prevent its misuse.""During his address, Munir reiterated Pakistan's resolve to combat terrorism and contribute to global peace.

The toxic smog affecting Lahore and other parts of Pakistan has worsened, with more than 15,000 cases of respiratory and viral infections reported in a single day, Ary News reported on Thursday.According to Swiss group IQAir, Lahore’s pollution index reached a staggering 1165, while New Delhi and surrounding areas hovered around 350.Hospitals in Lahore are experiencing an influx of patients presenting symptoms including dry cough, respiratory distress, pneumonia, and chest infections.The primary government healthcare facilities have recorded substantial patient numbers: Mayo Hospital attended to over 4,000 individuals, Jinnah Hospital treated 3,500 patients, Gangaram Hospital received 3,000 cases, and Children's Hospital managed more than 2,000 patients.Healthcare professionals in Pakistan have highlighted the increased risk to children and individuals with underlying conditions such as asthma and cardiac ailments, Ary News reported.The atmospheric pollution has triggered a surge in various ailments, including pneumonia, chest infections, and dermatological conditions.The World Health Organization (WHO) warns that air pollution can lead to strokes, heart disease, lung cancer, and respiratory issues. Children, babies, and the elderly are especially vulnerable to these health risks.PM2.5, the fine particulate matter that poses the greatest danger, is the chief pollutant in Lahore’s air. It originates from fossil fuel combustion, dust storms, and wildfires, and has been linked to asthma, heart and lung disease, cancer, and cognitive impairment in children.Pakistani authorities are implementing comprehensive measures to address this environmental crisis. According to Pakistani media outlets, the Punjab Provincial Disaster Management Authority of Pakistan officially classified smog as a ""calamity"" and implemented emergency protocols.The pollution, mainly caused by industrial emissions, vehicle exhaust, and agricultural stubble burning, has triggered health emergencies.

Beijing is pushing Pakistan to allow its own security staff to provide protection to thousands of Chinese citizens working in the South Asian nation, during talks after a car bombing in Karachi that was seen as a major security breach, sources said.Last month’s airport bombing in the southern port city that killed two Chinese engineers returning to work on a project after a holiday in Thailand was the latest in a string of attacks on Beijing’s interests in Pakistan. The attacks, and Islamabad’s failure to deter them, have angered China, which has pushed Pakistan to begin formal negotiations for a joint security management system .Reuters spoke to five Pakistani security and govt sources with direct knowledge of the previously unreported negotiations, and reviewed a written proposal sent by Beijing to Islamabad. “They (Chinese) want to bring in their own security,” said one official, who sat in on a recent meeting, adding that Pa kistan had not so far agreed to such a step.A written proposal sent to Islamabad by Beijing, and forwarded to Pakistani security agencies for review, mentioned a clause allowing the dispatching of security agencies and military forces into each others’ territory to assist in counter-terrorism missions and conduct joint strikes. The dispatching would be done after discussions, but Pakistani agencies were averse to the proposal, one official said.Neither Beijing nor Islama bad confirmed the talks officially. The source, and two other officials, said there was a consensus on setting up a joint security management system, and that Pakistan was amenable to Chinese officials sitting in on security meetings and co-ordination. But there was no agreement on their participating in security arrangements on the ground. The first official said Pakistan had asked China for help in improving its intelligence and surveillance capabilities instead of direct involvement.The nature of the Karachi bombing has angered Beijing: A pick-up truck rigged with nearly 100 kg of explosives waited unchecked for 40 minutes near the outermost security cordon of the heavily guarded airport before its driver rammed it into the vehicle carrying Chinese engineers, officials said. “It was agrave security breach,” admitted one of the officials investigating the blast. Investigators believe the attackers had “inside help” in securing details of the itinerary and route.","Beijing is pushing Pakistan to allow its own security staff to provide protection to thousands of Chinese citizens working in the South Asian nation.

Over 11 million children under five years of age are exposed to this smog in the worst-affected districts.""He noted that even before this year’s record-breaking smog, 12% of deaths in children under five in Pakistan were attributed to air pollution—a number likely to increase with the ongoing crisis.Fadil warned of the additional risks to expectant mothers, stating that exposure to polluted air increases the likelihood of premature births, respiratory complications, and low birth weight. ""When pregnant women are exposed to polluted air, they are more likely to give birth prematurely, face respiratory issues, and their babies may have a low birth weight. We cannot afford to let our babies breathe toxic air. We cannot let the health, education, and well-being of millions of children suffer,"" he said.Calling on the government for immediate intervention, Fadil said that clean air is a fundamental right for every child, highlighting the urgency of protective measures to safeguard the health of Pakistan's youngest citizens amidst this crisis.Dawn reported that Punjab's Air Quality Index (AQI) has surged to critical levels, with seven districts, including Sialkot, registering AQI readings above 400 and one district reaching a staggering 774.In response to this escalating public health emergency, local authorities have temporarily closed schools until November 17. Residents are also being restricted from public parks, zoos, playgrounds, and museums to limit their exposure to the dangerous smog levels.The Unicef office in Islamabad highlighted that cities like Lahore and Multan are recording unprecedented levels of air pollution, with hospitals admitting numerous patients affected by the toxic air, including dozens of young children.","Unicef representative in Pakistan Abdullah Fadil warned of severe health risks facing around 11 million children.

'Army chief for life': How the 'establishment' is tightening its grip on elected government in Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/army-chief-for-life-how-the-establishment-is-tightening-its-grip-on-elected-government-in-pakistan/articleshow/115173618.cms,"Implication of the amendment

The 'establishment'



Not the first time

More changes



The recent amendment to the Pakistan Army Act, which extends the tenure of the Chief of Army Staff (COAS) from three to five years, has sparked significant debate and concern regarding the implications for civil-military relations in Pakistan .This legislative change, hastily approved by the ruling coalition led by PM Shehbaz Sharif's PML-N, not only lengthens the term of the army chief but also removes the retirement age limit for four-star generals, effectively allowing military leaders to remain in power indefinitely.The amendment allows the current COAS, General Asim Munir , who was appointed in November 2022 and was set to retire in 2025, to potentially serve until 2027 or longer if further extensions are granted. This change is seen as a continuation of a trend where military leaders have managed to extend their tenures beyond traditional limits.The amendment was moved by defence minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif and received majority support despite strong opposition protests from the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, led by former PM Imran Khan.The PTI lawmakers criticised the expedited process of passing such crucial legislation without adequate debate, arguing that it undermines democratic principles in a country already grappling with political instabilityThe removal of the retirement age limit for the army chief raises critical concerns about the balance of power between civilian governance and military authority in Pakistan.Critics argue that this move consolidates military power at a time when civilian institutions are already perceived as weak. The ability for an army chief to remain in power indefinitely could lead to a scenario where military influence over political affairs becomes even more pronounced, effectively sidelining elected representatives.Michael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center, noted that such legislative actions transform the legislative into a ""rubber stamp"", thereby diminishing democratic governance.The Pakistan army has been a dominant force in the country's political landscape since its inception in 1947, often overshadowing elected governments.The military's involvement in politics began almost immediately, with its first significant intervention occurring in 1958 when General Muhammad Ayub Khan led a coup against the civilian government, citing corruption and inefficiency.Since that initial coup, the army has directly ruled the country for about 36 years, while also exerting considerable influence during periods of civilian rule.Major coups occurred under Ayub Khan (1958), Yahya Khan (1969), and Zia-ul-Haq (1977), each time justifying military rule as necessary for national stability.The military's rationale often centered around restoring order amid political chaos, which has led to a cycle of governance where elected officials frequently find themselves subordinate to military interests.The intertwining of military and political affairs has given rise to what analysts describe as the ""establishment"" or ""deep state"", where the military operates behind the scenes to influence policy decisions even when not in direct control.This dynamic has allowed the army to maintain significant control over key areas such as foreign policy, security, and economic management. For instance, during recent political upheavals, including the ousting of former Prime Minister Imran Khan in 2022, the military played a crucial role in shaping political outcomes.Elected governments have often been compelled to align their policies with military interests.Political leaders are acutely aware that their tenure could be jeopardized by military intervention if they stray too far from the army's preferences. This has led to a pattern where civilian governments consult with military leaders on critical issues, particularly those involving national security and foreign relations. The recent amendments to extend the tenure of the Chief of Army Staff reflect this ongoing power dynamic, allowing military leadership to exert even greater influence over governance without the constraints of a retirement age.In defense of the amendments, government officials have argued that extending military tenures is essential for maintaining stability and continuity in Pakistan's security leadership amid regional tensions. They contend that allowing military chiefs to serve longer terms will enable them to address national security challenges without disruptions caused by frequent leadership changes.Supporters of the amendment also claim that aligning military leadership tenures with other constitutional offices—many of which have five-year terms—provides a rational framework for governance.The legislative change is not unprecedented in Pakistan's history.Previous army chiefs have also enjoyed extended tenures through similar amendments or political maneuvering.General Qamar Javed Bajwa had his term extended multiple times during his tenure from 2016 to 2022.The pattern of extending military leadership has become almost standard practice, raising questions about accountability and oversight within Pakistan's political system.Observers note that General Munir's potential extended tenure could mirror historical figures like General Zia-ul-Haq, whose prolonged rule led to widespread discontent among both military ranks and civilians due to perceived mismanagement and authoritarian practices.The removal of age limits and potential for indefinite extensions could lead to a scenario where future army chiefs similarly consolidate power.Moreover, there are concerns that these changes may pave the way for further legal amendments aimed at consolidating military power across other branches of government.For instance, recent discussions around increasing the number of Supreme Court judges could be interpreted as an attempt to ensure favorable judicial outcomes for military interests.","The Pakistan army has been a dominant force in the country's political landscape since its inception in 1947.

"Lahore Air Quality Index: Pakistan restricts outdoor activities, market hours to curb air pollution-related illness",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-restricts-outdoor-activities-market-hours-to-curb-air-pollution-related-illness/articleshow/115174509.cms,"Pakistan restricts outdoor activities, market hours to curb air pollution-related illness (Picture credit: Reuters)

Pakistan's Punjab province has introduced strict measures to combat rising illnesses caused by severe air pollution. Starting Monday, most outdoor activities are banned, and shops, markets, and malls in certain areas are required to close early.This move follows an earlier decision to shut down educational institutions and public spaces like parks and zoos in Lahore and nearby districts until November 17.Lahore, which has been ranked as the world's most polluted city by Swiss air quality monitor IQAir, recently recorded an Air Quality Index (AQI) of over 600, significantly lower than the alarming 1,900 it reached earlier in the month. For context, an AQI between 0-50 is considered 'good'.The worsening air quality has led to a sharp increase in cases of respiratory diseases, eye irritation, and conjunctivitis in districts like Lahore, Multan, Faisalabad, and Gujranwala.The Punjab government noted an unprecedented rise in patients suffering from these conditions, attributing the spread of pink eye disease to dust, smoke, and chemical exposure.As part of the new restrictions, outdoor sports events, exhibitions, and festivals have been prohibited, while essential religious activities remain exempt. Pharmacies, dairy shops, and vegetable outlets are allowed to operate until 8 pm (local time).The pollution crisis has been particularly severe in Lahore, where thick smog has caused reduced visibility, leading to road accidents. In one incident, nine people were injured on GT Road when a van collided with a parked truck due to the dense haze.Authorities in Multan are facing even more critical conditions, with the AQI reaching over 2,000 last Friday. The concentration of PM2.5 particles, a harmful pollutant known to cause severe respiratory issues, was recorded at 947 micrograms per cubic meter, which is nearly 190 times higher than World Health Organization guidelines.Critics have pointed out that the government has been slow to enforce preventive measures, with many residents seen without masks despite the hazardous air quality.Authorities have blamed cross-border winds from India for exacerbating the smog, claiming that pollutants drifting from across the border have worsened the air quality in Pakistan’s Punjab province. The Punjab government has expressed its intention to take up the issue with Indian authorities through diplomatic channels.","Pakistan's Punjab province has introduced strict measures to combat rising illnesses caused by severe air pollution.

"‘I have eight kids, you’re not getting to me’: US tourist grabs thief by ponytail after getting pickpocketed in Venice",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/i-have-eight-kids-youre-not-getting-to-me-us-tourist-grabs-thief-by-ponytail-after-getting-pickpocketed-in-venice-watch/articleshow/123492805.cms,"US tourist grabs thief by ponytail after getting pickpocketed in Venice





A holidaymaker from North Carolina turned the tables on a group of suspected pickpockets in Venice after her purse and passport were stolen, dramatically grabbing one teenager by the ponytail until police arrived.Footage of the incident, shared on TikTok by the woman’s daughter Karis McElroy, shows her mother clutching the 14-year-old suspect by the hair as crowds gathered around. “I have eight kids, you’re not getting to me,” the woman is heard saying as the girl screamed.The video has since gone viral on social media.According to Karis, her mother and stepfather realised something was wrong after they were jostled on a narrow bridge while walking to their Airbnb. Her backpack had been unzipped and a purse containing cash, credit cards, AirPods, a passport, and even a metal water bottle was missing. Using the “Find My Friends” feature linked to her AirPods, they tracked the stolen bag to three girls nearby.“She goes and chases them down, and she grabs one of the girls by her ponytail and does not let go. Two of the girls stay, one of the girls runs away with my mom’s purse,” Karis explained in a follow-up video.As per Fox 11 Los Angeles, the confrontation escalated when one of the teenagers swung the stolen bag at the tourist, hitting her in the head. The water bottle inside caused a deep gash, leaving her bleeding and with a black eye. She was later treated in hospital and required stitches.Italian newspaper Il Messaggero reported that the 14-year-old held by the ponytail was arrested but released on bail just two days later.Another girl who fled was eventually stopped at an airport, where police recovered the tourist’s passport and credit cards, though her cash and AirPods were not returned, reported the New York Post.Despite the ordeal, Karis said her mother praised the kindness of Venetians, mentioning that their Airbnb host stood by her during the confrontation and a nearby jeweller even gifted her a necklace after the attack.The couple, who were beginning a Mediterranean cruise from Venice, have continued their trip. “She didn’t care about the other stuff in the bag, but she just at least wanted her passport so she could get home,” Karis said.","US tourist grabs thief by ponytail after getting pickpocketed in Venice.

Moscow says Kyiv has struck a nuclear power plant as Ukraine marks Independence Day,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/moscow-says-kyiv-has-struck-a-nuclear-power-plant-as-ukraine-marks-independence-day/articleshow/123492027.cms,"



Russia accused Ukraine on Sunday of launching drone attacks that sparked a fire at a nuclear power plant in its western Kursk region overnight, as Ukraine celebrated 34 years since its independence.Russian officials said several power and energy facilities were targeted in the overnight strikes. The fire at the nuclear facility was quickly extinguished with no injuries reported, according to the plant's press service on Telegram. While the attack damaged a transformer, radiation levels remained within normal ranges.The United Nations' nuclear watchdog said it was aware of media reports that a transformer at the plants had caught fire ""due to military activity,"" but hadn't received independent confirmation. It said its director-general, Rafael Mariano Grossi, said that ""every nuclear facility must be protected at all times.""Ukraine did not immediately comment on the alleged attack.Firefighters also responded to a blaze at the port of Ust-Luga in Russia's Leningrad region, home to a major fuel export terminal. The regional governor said approximately 10 Ukrainian drones were shot down, with debris igniting the fire.Russia's Defense Ministry claimed its air defenses intercepted 95 Ukrainian drones over Russian territory overnight into Sunday.Russia fired 72 drones and decoys, along with a cruise missile, into Ukraine overnight into Sunday, Ukraine's air force said. Of these, 48 drones were shot down or jammed.Another wartime Independence Day The incidents occurred as Ukraine marked Independence Day, commemorating its 1991 declaration of independence from the Soviet Union. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy delivered remarks in a video address from Kyiv's Independence Square, emphasizing the nation's resolve.""We are building a Ukraine that will have enough strength and power to live in security and peace,"" Zelenskyy said, calling for a ""just peace.""""What our future will be is up to us alone,"" he said, in a nod to the U.S.-Russia summit in Alaska earlier in August, which many feared would leave Ukrainian and European interests sidelined.""And the world knows this. And the world respects this. It respects Ukraine. It perceives Ukraine as an equal,"" he said.U.S. special envoy Keith Kellogg was in attendance at Independence Day celebrations in Kyiv, during which Zelenskyy awarded him the Ukrainian Order of Merit, of the 1st degree.Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney arrived in Kyiv on Sunday morning for meetings with Zelenskyy.""On this special day - Ukraine's Independence Day - it is especially important for us to feel the support of our friends. And Canada has always stood by our side,"" wrote Andriy Yermak, Zelenskyy's chief of staff.Military aid and prayers for peace In a joint news conference with Zelenskyy, Carney said Canada will invest 2 billion Canadian dollars ($1.5 billion) in new military assistance for Ukraine to boost its army and provide urgently needed weapons.Zelenskyy said the two leaders were considering the presence of Canadian forces on the ground in Ukraine as part of a reassurance force.Norway announced significant new military aid Sunday, pledging about 7 billion kroner ($695 million) for air defense systems. Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store said Norway and Germany are jointly funding two Patriot systems, including missiles, with Norway also helping procure air defense radar.Pope Leo XIV prayed Sunday for peace in Ukraine as he marked the country's Independence Day with a special appeal during his weekly noon blessing. He said the faithful were joining Ukrainians ""asking that the Lord give peace to their martyred country.""Leo also sent a telegram to Zelenskyy, which the Ukrainian leader posted on X along with similar notes from other world leaders.In the letter, Leo assured his prayers for all Ukrainians who are suffering, and wrote: ""I implore the Lord to move the hearts of people of good will, that the clamor of arms may fall silent and give way to dialogue, opening the path to peace for the good of all.""A war of attrition Meanwhile, Russia's troops continued their push in eastern and northern Ukraine, where Russia claimed Saturday that its forces had seized two villages in the Donetsk region. The Main Intelligence Directorate of Ukraine's Defense Ministry said Sunday that Ukraine had taken back control of the village of Novomykhailivka, also in the Donetsk region.Russia's Defense Ministry said Sunday that 146 Russian servicemen had been returned from Ukraine, in exchange for the same number of Ukrainian servicemen. The ministry said the latest exchange also included eight residents of Russia's Kursk region, which was subject to a surprise Ukrainian incursion in August 2024, who were returned to Russia after being held in Ukraine.Shortly after the Russian announcement, Zelenskyy said ""our people are coming home."" He said that those being exchanged included members of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, the National Guard, the State Border Guard Service and civilians. ""Most of them had been in captivity since 2022,"" he said.Zelenskyy did not confirm the number of prisoners involved in the exchange.","Russia says its air defenses intercepted 95 Ukrainian drones over Russian territory.

Anti-semitism row: Paris summons US ambassador Charles Kushner; slams ‘unacceptable’ allegations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/antisemitism-row-paris-summons-us-ambassador-slams-unacceptable-allegations/articleshow/123491877.cms,"File photo: French President Emmanuel Macron (left) and American ambassador in Paris, Charles Kushner (Picture credit: AP)





France has summoned the American ambassador in Paris, Charles Kushner, after he accused President Emmanuel Macron ’s government of failing to act strongly enough against antisemitism.The French foreign ministry said in a statement on Sunday that Kushner’s allegations were “unacceptable” and that he had been called to appear at the ministry for Europe and foreign affairs on Monday.“France firmly rejects these allegations,” the ministry added, stressing that French authorities were “fully mobilised” to tackle antisemitic acts which it called “intolerable.” According to news agency AP, the ministry also warned that Kushner’s intervention violated the Vienna Convention by interfering in the internal affairs of another country.Kushner, a real-estate developer and father of Jared Kushner, who is married to US President Donald Trump’s daughter Ivanka, had published the remarks in a letter to Macron carried by the Wall Street Journal.In it, he alleged that antisemitism in France had “exploded” since the Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October 2023 and the subsequent war in Gaza. “In France, not a day passes without Jews assaulted in the street, synagogues or schools defaced, or Jewish-owned businesses vandalised,” Kushner wrote, urging Macron to enforce hate-crime laws more vigorously and to soften criticism of Israel.According to news agency Reuters, he also tied the surge in antisemitic incidents to France’s plan to recognise a Palestinian state, arguing that such moves embolden extremists.As per BBC, Kushner’s claims echoed comments made earlier by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who had also accused Macron of fuelling antisemitism through his stance on Palestinian statehood. Macron, however, has argued that recognising Palestine is essential for long-term peace and has simultaneously increased security at synagogues and Jewish centres.The episode comes at a sensitive time in Franco-American relations. According to AP, both governments have clashed recently over trade disputes, the future of UN peacekeepers in Lebanon, and their approaches to the war in Ukraine.Still, Macron held what was described as a “warm” meeting with Trump and other European leaders in Washington last week.France is home to Western Europe’s largest Jewish community, estimated at around 500,000 people, as well as a large Muslim population. Both groups have reported a rise in hate crimes since the Gaza conflict began, with the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory claiming more than 60,000 people have been killed in Israeli strikes, according to BBC.The White House has not commented on the row, but state department spokesperson Tommy Pigott defended Kushner on Sunday and was quoted by AP as saying, “Ambassador Kushner is our US government representative in France and is doing a great job advancing our national interests in that role”.","Charles Kushner accused French government of failing to act strongly enough against antisemitism.

The Post





Mingus Lucien Reedus, 25, son of actor Norman Reedus and supermodel Helena Christensen , was arrested in Manhattan on Saturday morning over an alleged assault, the New York Post reported.Reedus allegedly punched a 33-year-old woman to wake her up before choking her and slamming her to the ground inside a Chelsea apartment, police sources toldThe incident began when Reedus himself dialed 911 around 8:40 am (local time), reporting that a woman at the West 16th Street apartment was taking pills and threatening suicide. Responding officers were told by the woman that Reedus had attacked her. She was taken to Bellevue Hospital in stable condition, while Reedus was taken into custody.The 25-year-old, wearing green shorts, a black t-shirt and handcuffs, was photographed being led out by officers around 9:25 am. He has been charged with assault in the third degree and criminal obstruction of breathing, NYPD said.Reedus was then escorted out of the 10th Precinct into a police vehicle.Asked by reporters why he had called police, he replied, “I didn’t.” Reedus later called it “a misunderstanding.” A woman identifying herself as his girlfriend also described the episode as “a big misunderstanding.”This is not Reedus’ first brush with the law. In 2022, he accepted a plea deal over a 2021 incident at the San Gennaro Festival in Little Italy, where he allegedly punched a woman in the face.","Mingus Lucien Reedus, 25, son of actor Norman Reedus and supermodel Helena Christensen, was arrested in Manhattan on Saturday morning over an alleged assault.

Molten fury in Hawaii: Kilauea volcano erupts again with lava fountains soaring 100 feet; 31st eruption since December,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/molten-fury-in-hawaii-kilauea-volcano-erupts-again-with-fountains-soaring-100-feet-31st-eruption-since-december/articleshow/123469221.cms,"Kilauea volcano spews lava in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, Hawaii.

Mount Kilauea erupts again as Hawaii volcano shoots lava for 31st time since December





Hawaii’s Kilauea volcano roared back to life on Friday, hurling arcs of lava nearly 100 feet (30 metres) into the sky from its summit crater, in what marked the 31st eruption episode since December 2024.The activity began with steady spattering from a northern vent before lava overflowed onto the crater floor and later surged into towering fountains by the afternoon. According to news agency AP, officials confirmed the outburst was restricted to the summit, with no homes at risk.For those inside Hawai‘i Volcanoes National Park, the spectacle offered a front-row seat. Volunteer photographer Janice Wei described the sound as “a roaring jet engine or crashing ocean waves” and admitted she could still feel the heat from over a mile away.“Every eruption feels like I am sitting in the front row at nature’s most extraordinary show,” she was quoted as saying by AP.Scientists at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory explained that magma is rising at a rate of nearly 3.8 cubic metres per second, inflating underground chambers until pressure forces molten rock above ground.“It’s like a Champagne bottle being uncorked,” said scientist-in-charge Ken Hon as cited by AP, who noted that the same conduit has been carrying magma to the surface since December.Some eruptions have sent jets soaring more than 1,000 feet, though recent fountains appear shorter as the vent has widened. “We’re still gonna have spectacular eruptions,” said Steve Lundblad, a geology professor at the University of Hawaii at Hilo, adding that “they’re just going to be wider and not as high”.The event also holds deep cultural resonance. Native Hawaiian practitioner Huihui Kanahele-Mossman, who leads the Edith Kanakaʻole Foundation, said lava flows are not just destructive but the very land on which Hawaiians live.Linking eruptions to the goddess Pele, she performs chants and presents offerings such as awa and fern lei at the crater. “To be able to actually see that eruption that’s described in the mele, that’s always exciting to us and motivates us to stay in this tradition,” she explained.Tourism has already surged, with park visitation in April rising 49% compared with the same month last year. Authorities, however, urge caution, unstable cliffs, volcanic gases and ash remain serious hazards.Park spokesperson Jessica Ferracane advised visitors to sign up for USGS alerts, noting many episodes last only 10–12 hours.Kilauea, one of the planet’s most active volcanoes, has followed this explosive pattern only four times in the past two centuries, with notable eruptions in 1959, 1969 and a prolonged series that began in 1983.Scientists say it’s uncertain how long the current eruption will last. “Our job is like being a bunch of ants crawling on an elephant trying to figure out how the elephant works,” Hon remarked.","Hawaii's Kilauea volcano erupted on Friday, hurling arcs of lava nearly 100 feet (30 metres) into the sky from its summit crater.

"Gold scam racket: Indian-origin Roshan Shah charged in US, told victims fraudsters will target them if...",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/gold-scam-racket-indian-origin-roshan-shah-charged-in-us-told-victims-fraudsters-will-target-them-if-/articleshow/123474918.cms,"Indian-origin Roshan Shah charged in US for a gold scam.

How Roshan Shah was caught







A 21-year-old India has been charged in Wisconsin for fooling people into believing that they need to part with their gold so that the gold can be kept in a safe box in Washington DC, otherwise they will become targets of a scam and all their money will be gone. According to the Justice Department, Shah was in Canada on a student visa before entering the US on a visitor's visa.The court document said Shah traveled to different states and picked up cash and gold from various fraud victims. He was not alone in this, he had a racket of conspirators who used to get the proceeds from this elaborate scam.Police arrested Shah after he attempted to pick up gold from his fraud victims in New Berlin, Wisconsin. Details of his co-conspirators are not yet known, but they played key roles in the scam as they posed as law enforcement officials and convinced gullible victims that they needed to transfer their assets to gold and then a courier would pick that and put it in a safety box in DC. Shah said he was just a middleman.The victims had previously given over $500,000 worth of gold to couriers the victims believed to be working with the federal government, the court document said.If convicted, Shah will face up to 20 years in prison and forfeit property in an amount equal to the value of the property involved in the offense.A New Berlin couple went to police July 30 to report that they were probably being scammed out of over $526,000 between June 11 and the end of July through a series if transactions involving gold coins. They said they had seen a TV news report about a scam involving gold coins and realized they likely were victims of itThe couple said they responded to a pop-up ad on their computer and called a number. A person told them he was a special agent with the US Treasury. He told them they were the victims of a massive fraud scheme across the US also being investigated by the CIA and Federal Trade Commission.The man requested identifying information from the couple, and sent them images of a badge and credentials to show them that they were indeed from the government. Police later determined all those were fake. Another associate of that man, identified as a “Scott Bessent,” said he was a chief investigator for the Office of the Inspector General, and the couple was advised to keep in contact with both men, whom they said had Middle Eastern accents and sounded as though they were calling from a call center, the complaint said.The couple was asked to forward gold coins to a safety deposit box opene din their name in the George W. Bush Federal Building in Washington, D.C., which does not actually exist. The couple engaged in a series of password-protected courier transactions but in the middle of the entire process, they suspected that something was amiss.Shah told police he arrived in the US on June 17 from Canada, only to be a courier for this scam. He arrived in the US in June and has done 10 or 11 jobs, including in Florida, Texas, Colorado, Arizona, Virginia, Illinois, Indiana and Milwaukee.","Roshan Shah was in Canada on a student visa before entering the US on a visitor's visa.

"Harvard making changes Trump officials want, even without a deal",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/harvard-making-changes-trump-officials-want-even-without-a-deal/articleshow/123492058.cms,"



Early in the spring, an aggressive and polarizing new presidential administration drafted a menu of demands, many of them very specific, designed to reshape the culture at Harvard, the nation's richest university.With billions of dollars in research funds in jeopardy, the university's leaders are now negotiating with the White House. But an eventual deal may not fully capture the changes, small and large, already enacted at Harvard before any papers are signed.The university has recoiled at some of the sweeping changes the Trump administration demanded. Harvard's president, Dr. Alan M. Garber, has singled out several as intrusive and unconstitutional, including demands that might influence whom the university hires and admits.But it has also taken a host of steps that align with the White House's desires, checking off items on the administration's detailed menu, which have ranged from eliminating diversity offices to ousting program leaders.President Donald Trump and his appointees have made their attack on Harvard a totem for the changes they want to see across America's elite universities, using the government's blunt power to force compliance in a manner never before seen.The Trump administration's demands included eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion programs. In April, Harvard renamed its Office of Equity, Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging, which is now called the Office for Community and Campus Life. More recently, Harvard also took down websites for its Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations, as well as websites for companion offices for gay and female students, and said they were merging them into a new, single center.The government has also sought leadership shake-ups in certain departments, including the Center for Middle Eastern Studies, after Jewish alumni and others accused the programs of sponsoring antisemitic programming. Harvard removed two of the center's leaders, including Cemal Kafadar, a leading Turkish scholar, in March.And Trump officials asked for an end to Harvard's partnership with Birzeit University, a top Palestinian college in the West Bank. Harvard said it had suspended the relationship and had struck up new ones with institutions in Israel.The university has announced some of the changes, arguing that they were needed to make the campus more welcoming and more open to different viewpoints. But Kirsten Weld, a Harvard history professor, says that while the university says it is independently adopting measures that mirror some of the White House demands, that's a slippery contention.","The university has recoiled at some of the sweeping changes the Trump administration demanded.

US immigrant population drops for first time in decades: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-immigrant-population-drops-for-first-time-in-decades-report/articleshow/123491953.cms,"



For the first time in decades, more immigrants are leaving the US than arriving, a new study finds, an early indication that President Trump's hard-line immigration agenda is leading people to depart - whether through deportation or by choice. An analysis of new census data released last week by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center found that between Jan and June, the foreign-born population in the US - both lawful and unlawful residents - declined by nearly 1.5 million. In June, the country was home to 51.9 million immigrants, down from 53.3 million six months earlier.Officials from the Trump administration have applauded the net outflow, asserting that pressures on govt services have eased and that job markets have rebounded. And some supporters of the immigration crackdown say it hasn't gone far enough.But experts predict looming negative economic and demographic consequences for the US if the trend persists. Immigrants are a crucial workforce in many sectors, and the country's reliance on them is growing as more baby boomers retire.Lillian Divina Leite, 46, chose to use govt's new self-deportation program to return to Brazil. A housekeeper in Charlotte, North Carolina, Leite said that she had begun to panic when she saw immigrants being ""hunted down like hardened criminals.""""I got really scared,"" said Leite, who had fallen out of legal status after overstaying a six-month tourist visa. ""I thought, I haven't done anything wrong in my life,"" she said, ""and suddenly I could be imprisoned. ""Despite the study's findings, Kevin Lynn, executive director of the Institute for Sound Public Policy, which advocates for less immigration, said that foreign workers who enter lawfully continue to pour into the United States and undermine Americans. ""There has been no letup,"" he said. ""People coming here legally, whether on green cards or employment visas, are impacting American workers at all strata, whether low-skilled or high-skilled. ""Net migration - the difference between the number of immigrants arriving and departing - has turned negative, a shift that the chief Pew demographer, Jeffrey Passel, called a ""demographic certainty"" so far in 2025. His team's analysis did not calculate a separate number for immigrants without lawful status who seem likely to represent the largest number of departures, because heightened enforcement probably diminished immigrants' participation in the census survey that was used to make estimates, he said. They may have been under-counted, which would suggest the drop is not as severe, or their low participation could mask an even more striking decline. The US experienced negative net immigration in the 1930s, during the Great Depression. ""A rapid decline in immigration is going to cause economic harm,"" said Tara Watson, an economist at the Brookings Institution and one of the authors of the report. Political pushback and legal challenges could lead the Trump administration to ease its crackdown and, thus, soften the impact, she said.","Net migration - the difference between the number of immigrants arriving and departing - has turned negative.

An American Airlines flight from Philadelphia to Phoenix was forced to make an emergency landing on Saturday, after a passenger's electronic device caught fire mid-air, causing smoke inside the cabin.Flight 357, carrying 160 passengers and six crew members, landed safely at Washington Dulles International Airport around 11:50 a.m., where it was met by emergency responders, according to the US federal aviation administration (FAA). The exact device that caused the fire has not been disclosed, reported ABC news.American Airlines confirmed the incident in a statement: “The device was quickly contained by crew members prior to landing.”Passenger Adriana Novello, 22, told the news portal that she woke up to a flight attendant rushing for the fire extinguisher. “Then I started smelling smoke, and a lot of people on the plane were coughing,” she said. “But I looked behind me, and what we could tell was that there was something on fire in the aisle.”As smartphones and portable chargers have become more common, the number of in-flight fires caused by these devices has gone up sharply.In February, the FAA said such incidents have increased by 388% over the last 10 years.Several similar incidents have occurred recently. Earlier this year, a power bank caught fire on a Batik Airlines flight from Malaysia to Bangkok, filling the cabin with smoke. A comparable event occurred during an AirAsia flight in Thailand last winter.In light of these risks, the US transportation security administration (TSA) has recently updated its “don’t pack” list. Newly restricted items include gas-powered curling irons and flat irons, as well as gas refills, though corded versions remain allowed in luggage.All passengers and crew on the American Airlines flight were safe, and the flight was rescheduled after the incident.","Flight 357, carrying 160 passengers and six crew members, landed safely at Washington Dulles International Airport around 11:50 a.m. The exact device that caused the fire has not been disclosed.

‘Will send troops if needed’: Trump threatens Baltimore; slams Maryland governor Wes Moore over crime,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/will-send-troops-if-needed-trump-threatens-baltimore-slams-maryland-governor-wes-moore-over-crime/articleshow/123486497.cms,"Wes Moore (left), Donald Trump (AP, PTI)

'Trump A Threat To New York': Zohran Mamdani Challenges U.S. President On Takeover By National Guard





US President Donald Trump has warned that he may send federal troops to Baltimore, sharply criticising Maryland Governor Wes Moore’s handling of crime in the city.The statement, posted on Sunday on his Truth Social platform, follows similar threats made by him regarding New York City, and Chicago, this week.Responding to a recent challenge by Governor Moore to ""walk the streets of Maryland"" with him, Trump wrote: “I assume he is talking about out of control, crime ridden, Baltimore? As President, I would much prefer that he clean up this crime disaster before I go there for a ‘walk’.”Accusing Moore of having a poor crime record, Trump added, “If Wes Moore needs help, like Gavin Newscum did in LA, I will send in the ‘troops,’ which is being done in nearby DC, and quickly clean up the Crime.” Trump referred to California Governor Gavin Newsom as “Gavin Newscum,” a derogatory twist he has often used in past posts.Trump, who recently claimed credit for a reported drop in crime in Washington DC following increased federal presence, warned that similar action could be taken in Baltimore if conditions persist.“After only one week, there is NO CRIME AND NO MURDER IN DC!

Gerrymandering face-off: Hakeem Jeffries hits back at GOP; says ready for redistricting push in blue states,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/gerrymandering-face-off-hakeem-jeffries-hits-back-at-gop-says-ready-for-redistricting-push-in-blue-states/articleshow/123486187.cms,"Hakeem Jeffries (AP)





US House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries on Sunday said Democrats are prepared to expand gerrymandering efforts in blue states in response to Republican redistricting moves being encouraged by President Donald Trump, reported news portal Politico.Speaking to CNN’s State of the Union, Jeffries said Democrats have already acted in California after Texas Republicans approved a new congressional map that could give them five additional seats in next year’s midterms.“Right now, this has happened in Texas. California has responded,” Jeffries said. “Let’s see what comes next,” as quoted by the portal.The redistricting developments signal a fresh phase of partisan map-drawing battles, with Texas Republicans acting on Trump’s push for GOP-led states like Indiana and Missouri to secure more seats through mid-decade redraws.In California, Democratic governor Gavin Newsom is leading efforts to add five new seats, with a special election likely in the fall for voter approval.Jeffries hinted that if Republicans escalate their redistricting strategy, Democrats could follow suit in other blue states. However, some states present institutional hurdles. New York, for example, has an independent redistricting commission that cannot be overhauled until 2027, limiting immediate options for Democrats there.Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, also seen as a potential 2028 contender, has little room to expand as the current map already heavily favours Democrats, who hold 14 of the state’s 17 seats.Despite the redistricting standoff, Jeffries downplayed concerns about Republican gains, citing the 2018 midterms when Democrats flipped 41 seats during Trump’s presidency.“As Democrats, we’re going to focus as well on fixing our broken health care system and cleaning up corruption,” Jeffries said. “So we have an affirmative agenda that is compelling that we will continue to present to the American people. The Republicans have failed. That is why they are running scared.”",US House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Democrats are prepared to expand gerrymandering efforts in blue states in response to Republican redistricting moves.

Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Big Op Sindoor Lie Claims India Begged For Ceasefire, Trump Stepped In





ISLAMABAD: Nearly 100 days after Indian fighter jets pounded “terror bases” in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), local police said they have arrested a man who allegedly passed on the GPS coordinates of a mosque that was among those hit.The May 6 raids had left the Bilal Mosque in Muzaffarabad badly damaged, with three fatalities reported. Now, PoK police say Obaid Jahangir of Rawalakot “sold out” by sharing its exact GPS location with India over WhatsApp, allegedly for money.Obaid has been booked under the draconian Official Secrets Act, 1923, with police claiming they had recovered “hard evidence” of espionage. “He passed on sensitive images and the mosque’s coordinates in exchange for hefty payments,” claimed SSP Riaz Mughal of PoK police’s counter-terrorism department (CTD).But the case is already mired in conflicting narratives. Another senior CTD officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, went further, alleging Jahangir had a past with a banned outfit before joining a so-called relief organisation. Investigators, he added, had traced communications with Indian handlers on his phone.The family, however, insists Obaid is no militant. His uncle admitted the 30-something may have “fallen into a money trap” but stressed he was only associated with the Jammu Kashmir United Movement, a relief body.“If he is guilty, he should face the law, but he has never been part of any militant outfit,” the uncle maintained.His lawyer, Abdul Samad, pointed out that the sections invoked against him cover trespassing into restricted areas and passing on information “prejudicial to national security”. Conviction under these clauses carries punishments ranging from 14 years in prison to life.Earlier this year, too, PoK police had arrested a police constable on charges of selling sensitive information across the border.","Indian fighter jets pounded ‘terror bases’ in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) Nearly 100 days later, local police said they have arrested a man who allegedly passed on the GPS coordinates of a mosque.

Pakistan blaze: Fireworks warehouse explosion injures at least 25; fire triggers road closures in Karachi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-blaze-fireworks-warehouse-explosion-injures-at-least-25-fire-triggers-road-closures-in-karachi/articleshow/123434002.cms,"



At least 25 people, including some in critical condition, were injured after an explosion took place at a fireworks storage facility in Karachi, Pakistan.Thick smoke could be seen billowing into the sky from the building where firecrackers were stored, according to television footage.Witnesses cited by AP said that broken glass from nearby shops covered the road and panicked residents fled the scene.Firefighters rushed to extinguish the blaze while ambulances ferried the injured, including passers-by, to hospitals.Senior police official Asad Raza said several shops and vehicles on Jinnah Road were damaged in the blast. The cause of the explosion was not immediately known.The fire was reported in a warehouse near Taj Complex on MA Jinnah Road, a Rescue 1122 spokesperson said, adding,“as soon as Rescue 1122’s Central Command and Control team received the information, the Fire and Rescue team reached the scene along with an ambulance and two fire brigade trucks.”Police surgeon Summaiya Syed told Dawn, “Sixteen injured at Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre [with] two critical. Fourteen at Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Trauma Centre,” adding that the warehouse had been storing firecrackers.Karachi traffic police said MA Jinnah Road had been closed due to the fire, with traffic from Numaish being diverted towards Society Signal and Ali Raza Imambargah.Citizens were advised to call the Traffic Police helpline at 1915 for alternate routes “to avoid inconvenience,” the Dawn reported.Sindh CM Murad Ali Shah took notice of the incident and directed officials to control the blaze and ensure no lives were lost. According to a statement, he also ordered the Karachi Commissioner to provide immediate medical assistance to the injured and submit a detailed report. “There is no permission to produce materials near cities or populated areas which can cause damage,” CM Murad was quoted as saying.The Sindh home ministry later issued a statement saying 20 people had been injured in the blaze.Home minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar directed police reinforcements to the scene, saying, “Police reinforcements should be sent to rescue the injured and transfer them quickly to the nearest hospital. An investigation must be completed and a report submitted soon.”Lanjar also instructed investigators to include statements from the injured and evidence from the scene, Dawn furthed added.Explosions at fireworks facilities are not uncommon in Pakistan. In January, six people were killed in a similar blast at a fireworks storage site in Mandi Bahauddin, Punjab province. Fires in commercial and residential buildings are also frequent, largely blamed on poor infrastructure, weak enforcement of safety rules, and negligence.","At least 25 people, including some in critical condition, injured after explosion at fireworks storage facility in Karachi, Pakistan.

Targeting Ahmadiyya community



Blasphemy accusations







The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan has raised alarm over violence against minority communities in the country.HRCP on Thursday released its latest report, Streets of Fear: Freedom of Religion or Belief in 2024/25, documenting violations of freedom of religion or belief (FORB) between 1 July 2024 and 30 June 2025.The report painted a picture as grim as in previous years, recording targeted killings, forced conversions, mob lynchings, hate speech, desecration of places of worship and extrajudicial killings. It also warned that religious freedom in Pakistan is facing an unprecedented threat.The HRCP highlighted several cases where individuals were killed over blasphemy accusations, describing the trend as deeply troubling in a country that has already witnessed the assassination of a provincial governor by his own security guard.The HRCP report noted that the pattern of minor non-Muslim girls disappearing and later resurfacing after allegedly converting to Islam and marrying Muslim men persisted in 2024/25.Hindus in Sindh, who form 8.8% of the population, and Christians in Punjab (1.9%), have raised repeated concerns. A fact-finding study found that forced conversions and coerced marriages remain most prevalent among Scheduled Caste Hindus due to poverty and limited social mobility.The report highlighted the role of cleric-politician Mian Abdul Haq, or Mian Mithu, accused of using his influence to facilitate conversions at his seminary in Ghotki. He was sanctioned by the UK in 2022.The report also cited cases where police were seen siding with abductors, often claiming it would be “haram” to return a girl after conversion.In July 2024, Faisalabad police recovered Christian minor Laiba Suhail, abducted in February and forcibly converted before being married off illegally. Another girl, Alina, is still missing. In January 2025, a Mirpurkhas court heard a plea from a couple accused of forcing an underage Hindu girl to convert and marry.Other cases were reported across provinces: in April 2025, 14-year-old a Hindu girl, Chahat disappeared in Quetta and later claimed in a video to have converted, though her parents produced documents proving she was underage.In May, Hindu Panchayats in Ghotki and Rohri protested the disappearance of a Meghwar teenager in Rohri, fearing abduction for forced conversion. In June, civil society groups and Hindu Panchayats in Larkana expressed concern over three minor girls and a teenage boy from Shahdadpur allegedly being forced to convert.The HRCP stressed that such cases continue to deepen insecurity among religious minorities and called for protective measures to safeguard vulnerable children and their families.The report listed multiple killings of Ahmadis: dentist Zakaur Rahman in Lalamusa (July 2024), Tayyab Ahmad in Rawalpindi (December 2024), Amir Hasan in Naukot (December 2024), Laeeq Cheema lynched in Karachi (April 2025), Muhammad Asif in Kasur (April 2025), and senior doctor Mahmood Sheikh in Sargodha (May 2025).The UN warned, “We are alarmed by ongoing reports of violence and discrimination against the Ahmadiyya community in Pakistan.”“According to the data provided by the Ahmadiyya community, 29 Ahmadi places of worship were attacked and damaged during the review period,” the report said.It further added that in 26 cases, the demolition was carried out by law enforcement agencies.“These incidents occurred in Okara, Khanewal, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Vehari, Sheikhupura, Gujrat, and Sargodha, among other locations Back in January, a historic Sialkot site linked to Pakistan’s first foreign minister Zafarullah Khan was “reduced to rubble”.The report said that the blasphemy law has been often misused to settle personal scores or seek financial gain in Pakistan, where, a ‘mere accusation of blasphemy can be a death sentence.’In September, last year, two men accused of blasphemy were killed while in police custody less than a week apart. One was inexplicably shot and killed in Mirpurkhas during an alleged police encounter, and the other was killed by a police constable inside a police station in Quetta.On 12 September 2024, constable Saad Khan Sarhadi shot dead Abdul Ali, a blasphemy suspect, inside Quetta’s Cantonment Police Station after mobs from religious parties gathered outside demanding his custody. It marked the first such incident in the city where a serving officer killed a suspect in custody. Days later, Ali’s family pardoned Sarhadi, while lawyers and a JUI-F senator pledged legal support for him.Later, on 17 September 2024, Shahnawaz Kunbhar, a civil hospital employee from Umerkot, fled to Karachi after a cleric accused him of posting blasphemous content. He denied the charge in a video message before being arrested by police, who assured his family of protection. Two days later, police claimed he was killed in an encounter, with officers celebrated as heroes.His family was prevented from burying him by armed mobs, and the body was desecrated. Following outrage from rights groups, a Sindh police inquiry declared the encounter “fake.”The report also showed that the mainstream media largely ignored issues of religious freedom under the period covered. Even the Islamabad High Court’s hearings into the “blasphemy business group,” affecting nearly 400 households and livestreamed for four months, drew little coverage. Likewise, cases of coerced marriages, forced conversions and violence against minorities rarely made headlines.A worrying trend has emerged in Pakistan, where ultra-right-wing groups are exerting growing pressure on the judiciary and elected officials through propaganda and intimidation, it added.","The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan has raised alarm over violence against minority communities in the country.

’14 Pakistani Soldiers Killed’: Baloch Rebels Attack Day After India’s Strike On Terror Hubs | Watch





The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for an attack in Panjgur that left four Pakistan 's army personnel dead. According to BLA spokesperson Jeeyand Baloch, fighters launched a raid in the Surdu area of Panjgur on Tuesday night, eliminating a key operative of the Pakistan army.The statement revealed that Ghulam Sarwar had earlier established and commanded a so-called death squad under the protection of the Pakistani military. This squad, which had been active for years in Gichek and other parts of Panjgur, was later led by his son, Islam Sarwar. The group allegedly supported the army's operations, carrying out targeted killings, enforced disappearances, and other violent acts. In return, the army reportedly allowed them to freely engage in drug trafficking, kidnappings for ransom and extortion through road checkpoints.During the operation, BLA fighters seized three Kalashnikov rifles, an M-4, additional weapons, two vehicles, and three motorcycles from Islam Sarwar's hideout. The site, according to the BLA, also served as a torture chamber, where electric shock devices and other tools of abuse were found. Islam Sarwar was accused of abducting and killing a young man in Panjgur just two months earlier. Jeeyand Baloch warned that the Pakistani army and its allies would be held accountable for crimes against the Baloch people.The BLA's latest offensive is part of the ongoing insurgency in Balochistan , where separatist groups are demanding greater autonomy and recognition of Baloch rights. In recent years, attacks on military and paramilitary forces, along with government facilities, have intensified.Separatist factions argue that the Baloch people face systemic marginalisation and exploitation, despite the province's wealth in natural resources. In response, Pakistan's military has pursued counterinsurgency campaigns to suppress the rebellion. However, human rights groups have repeatedly raised concerns over reports of forced disappearances, extrajudicial killings, and excessive force during these operations.Numerous accounts point to the widespread issue of disappearances, with civilians and activists allegedly detained without due legal process. Rights organisations argue that such tactics fuel fear and deepen mistrust, further straining relations between the Pakistani state and the Baloch population.","Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for an attack in Panjgur that left four Pakistan's army personnel dead.

DHAKA: Pakistan on Sunday claimed it had twice settled the issue of the 1971 Liberation War genocide committed by the Pakistan army in which more than a million civilians were butchered.Visiting foreign minister of Pakistan, Ishaq Dar said the massacre of Bangla-speaking people in what then was eastern Pakistan and rapes of lakhs of women was settled twice in 1974 and early 2000s.The assertion generated shock because there is no evidence of Pakistan officially apologising for the crimes committed by its army, and was seen as an evidence of its resolve to achieve normalisation of ties on its own terms.Significantly, the Bangladesh interim govt did not specifically address Dar's claim, limiting itself to saying ""we have agreed"" to resolve the issue in the course of time."" There was no indication it was still insisting on an official apology which for decades was set as the minimum pre-requisite for starting the process of reconciliation. For Bangladesh, the other issues of concern are return of assets Pakistan seized after Bangladesh became an independent country, repatriation of stranded Pakistanis, and transfer of foreign aid meant for the 1970 cyclone victims.""On the matter of unresolved issues, what I want to say is that the first settlement took place in 1974,"" said Dar, who arrived in Dhaka on Saturday for a visit aimed at rebuilding ties with Bangladesh following the ouster of PM Sheikh Hasina, whose father led the struggle for independence and who was a hardliner on the issue of official apology. ""General Pervez Musharraf came here and resolved the issue openly. As a result, the issue was resolved twice. Once in 1974, and again in the early 2000s,"" he said.Bangladesh foreign affairs adviser Md Touhid Hossain said all ""unresolved"" issues were raised with Dar. ""We have agreed to resolve them to advance our bilateral relations further,"" Touhid told reporters after meeting Dar, who is the most senior leader from his country to visit Dhaka since 2012, after then Pakistan foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar. ""The issues accumulated over 54 years cannot be solved overnight. But we have agreed to address them over the due course of time,"" he added.Dar said Pakistan will provide advanced medical treatment, including limb replacement for 40 individuals, including students, injured during the ""July Uprising"" - the movement that led to Awami League govt's ouster last year.He also called on chief adviser Muhammad Yunus and their discussion covered revival of old connections between the two countries, promoting youth linkages, enhancing connectivity, and augmenting trade and economic cooperation, according to Pakistan's ministry of foreign affairs.Bangladesh foreign affairs ministry said, ""The meeting took place in a spirit of warmth and goodwill, reflecting the brotherly relations between the countries and their shared desire to augmenting engagement and cooperation.""",Pakistan claims it has settled issue of 1971 Liberation War genocide.

Sri Lanka’s Ex-President Ranil Wickremesinghe Arrested Over Alleged Misuse Of State Funds





Sri Lanka's jailed former president, Ranil Wickremesinghe, was admitted to the intensive care unit at Colombo National Hospital on Saturday, a day after being charged with misusing government funds for foreign travel.The deputy director-general of hospital Rukshan Bellana said that Wickremesinghe was reportedly severely dehydrated and required close monitoring.

(AP





CHEMMANI: A baby bottle, a squeaky toy and a schoolbag are among items that have surfaced from a mass grave site in Sri Lanka's formerly war-torn northern region, along with 141 human skeletons including some that appear to be of children of different ages.The findings were made at a cremation ground in the Chemmani area near Jaffna town, the cultural heartland of the country's ethnic Tamil minority. But hardly any burials take place here, as Hindus mostly cremate their dead according to religious customs.Excavations have been underway since June, after workers found human remains while digging to build an electric crematorium.A pit test over nine days discovered 19 sets of human remains. Shallow burials of about 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) in a scattered and disorganized manner, and the absence of clothing, indicated the site was a mass grave, according to a report provided to a court in June.Since the area was secured and declared a crime scene that month, a total of 141 skeletons have been discovered within a 165-square-meter (1,776-square-foot) area. About 135 of the bodies had no clothing, and only one set of adult clothing was identified.Tests confirmed that a skeleton found with a schoolbag was that of a girl between 4 and 6 years old. Toddlers' dresses, socks and footwear, tiny bead bangles and a baby powder tray were also recovered.The identities of the dead and the cause and timing of their deaths are all unclear. But many think the victims could be civilians who disappeared during Sri Lanka's civil war, which broke out in 1983 between government forces and ethnic Tamil rebels, who fought to create an independent homeland for the minority group. The war ended in 2009.Several Tamil armed groups and an Indian peacekeeping mission were active in the region over the decades. But attention has focused on the Sri Lankan military, which had a heavy presence for over a decade in Chemmani, as the gateway to Jaffna town.Decades-old confession heightens suspicions A confession made by an army soldier before he was sentenced to death for rape and murder 27 years ago has strengthened suspicions about the site.In 1998, Somaratne Rajapakse along with four alleged accomplices from the military and police were sentenced to death for the gang rape and murder of a schoolgirl and the killing of her mother, brother and a neighbor.The five, who weren't hanged and remain in prison due to a moratorium on executions, have maintained that they were not involved in the rape and murder, but only disposed of the bodies under orders.Rajapakse told the court that he knew where up to 400 bodies were buried in Chammani.""We cannot say exactly who the perpetrators are yet, but the finger points to the (state) army,"" said Brito Fernando, an activist working with the families of people who disappeared during various armed conflicts in Sri Lanka.The area, including the cremation ground, were under Sri Lankan military control from 1996, when it captured Jaffna from the rebels, until after the war ended in 2009. The military operated checkpoints, and anyone who entered or left the area was searched.In 1999, Rajapakse led police to a spot where the schoolgirl, her family and the neighbor were buried and later showed police other places where more remains were found. But the investigations were abruptly stopped.Families want closure Items found at the site were publicly displayed earlier this month in the hope that their owners would be identified, and many people from surrounding villages and beyond visited the site.Amalanathan Mary Calista, whose husband has been missing since 1996 when the military arrested him in their village, said she hoped seeing proof that her husband was dead would bring a sense of closure.""I went there hoping to see at least his clothes. There was a sarong (clothing that wraps around the waist) but it wasn't my husband's. He was wearing a blue sarong at the time. It was disappointing,"" she said.""I only saw the clothing of little children,"" she added, as she wept.She said her husband is among 24 people who never returned home after the military searched their village. Families had tried to block the army vehicles from taking away the detained people, but the authorities pushed them aside with guns and the vehicles sped away, she said.""My wish is that he should be alive and return, but we can do nothing if it is not so,"" she said.""The state army arrested him. They must say that they arrested him and that he died at their hands. They also must pay us compensation,"" she said.Woman recalls military taking her brother and husband away Sivanathan Selvamalar said she watched her younger brother being loaded into a military truck blindfolded during that same raid. Years later, in 2009, her husband was also detained at a checkpoint. He called her to tell her of his arrest and was not heard from again.""We went to see the things, thinking they may have buried people who were arrested around this area, but we saw only the things of little children,"" she said.""We have checked all the prisons but have not found them. When we are told that more than 100 skeletons have been dug out, we fear the worst,"" she added.No children listed in missing person reports A 2003 report by Sri Lanka's Human Rights Commission said it investigated 281 complaints of missing persons from 1990 to 1998. Of these, three were found in prisons and later released, while the rest are still unaccounted for. The report said the military was responsible for 243 cases, while the Tamil Tiger rebels were responsible for 25. The responsibility for 10 others is unknown.No children were listed as missing.Nadesapillai Vithyatharan, the editor of the only newspaper in the region at the time, said several families returned to Jaffna after fleeing into rebel-held territory as the military moved in. Some reportedly went missing after being stopped at checkpoints set up to look for infiltrating rebels, he said.Calls for DNA analysis Although previous investigations stalled, there is hope now that victims will be identified, Fernando said. But he said the government must do more to conduct a credible investigation.""We don't have proper guidelines to investigate the mass graves and have no DNA bank to help with identification,"" said Fernando, adding that the government should fund a DNA bank and enlist international support in the identification of victims.""Only a proper investigation by the government can free its military from suspicion,"" he said.Any direct probe into the military would likely anger Sri Lankan nationalists. Many of the majority ethnic Sinhalese admire the military for winning the civil war.Excavations will continue for 8 more weeks Ground-penetrating radar in other parts of the cremation ground has shown ""soil anomalies ... that are indicative of comparable density of buried skeletal remains,"" according to a report submitted in the Jaffna court last week.The scanned area is three times larger than the site that has been excavated, said Ranitha Gnanarajah, a lawyer monitoring the process. Investigators have requested court approval to continue excavations for eight more weeks, she said.Army spokesman Brig. Waruna Gamage said no one has formally accused the army of responsibility for the mass grave, and if they did they would need to show proof, he said.""The excavations are still ongoing and it is a civil matter belonging to the police and courts,"" Gamage said. ""We will respect the law of the country.""Government forces and the rebels are both accused of committing atrocities amounting to war crimes in the months leading to the end of the civil war in 2009.","A baby bottle, a squeaky toy and a schoolbag are among items that have surfaced from a mass grave site in Sri Lanka's formerly war-torn northern region.

China’s Wang Yi Lands In Pakistan After India Visit As Beijing Refreshes Af-Pak Ties With CPEC Push





ISLAMABAD: The foreign ministers of Afghanistan, China and Pakistan on Wednesday agreed to expand their cooperation in multiple fields, including extension of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ) to Kabul.Pakistan Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Afghanistan acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi took part in the 6th Trilateral Foreign Ministers Dialogue in Kabul which focused on political, economic and security cooperation.The agreement on extension of the multi-billion dollars CPEC comes as Islamabad and Beijing are expected to launch the second phase of the project later this month during Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's visit to China to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit.Pakistan's Foreign Office in a brief statement on X said that the three sides ""committed to strengthen joint efforts against terrorism"".""They also reaffirmed their commitment to deepening collaboration in trade, transit, regional development, health, education, culture, and combating drug trafficking, as well as, extension of CPEC to Afghanistan,"" it said.This is the first visit by the Chinese foreign minister to Afghanistan since the Taliban stormed to power in 2021 while the third by Dar to the Afghan capital since April.According to sources, China has played a role in easing tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan.In a bilateral meeting with his Afghanistan counterpart, Pakistan's foreign minister claimed there was an ""increase in terrorist attacks"" in his country by terrorist outfits operating from Afghanistan, the Foreign Office said.In the last trilateral meeting in May in Beijing, the foreign ministers of the three countries had first agreed to expand the CPEC to Afghanistan to boost ""trilateral"" cooperation.India has been severely critical of the CPEC as it passes through Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir.

At least 76 people were killed, including 17 children, in western Afghanistan after a bus carrying refugees collided with a truck and motorcycle and caught fire, according to provincial government spokesman Ahmadullah Muttaqi and local police.According to a news report from Al Jazeera, police said that the accident occurred due to the excessive speed and negligence of the bus. The bus route to Kabul was carrying refugees who were recently deported from Iran, according to provincial official Mohammad Yousuf Saeedi.They were part of a massive wave of Afghans who were deported from Iran recently.Earlier, Iranian minister of interior Eskandar Momeni announced that around 800,000 people would be deported by March.Saeedi said that all the passengers boarded the bus at a border crossing point, Islam Qala.Three passengers survived the accident after the bus collided with a motorcycle first and then hit the truck, which was carrying fuel. The collision was so strong that it led to the eruption of fire.Two people in the truck and another two on the motorcycle were among the deceased.","At least 76 people were killed, including 17 children, in western Afghanistan.

Climate crisis drives displacement





After decades of war, Afghanistan is moving to assert sovereignty over its water resources, a shift that is testing fragile ties with neighbouring countries.Since taking power in 2021, the Taliban have launched large-scale infrastructure projects, including dams and canals, to harness river flows that spill into Iran, Pakistan, and Central Asia.But as per news agency AFP, these efforts are fuelling disputes, with climate change worsening water shortages across the region.The most contentious initiative is the Qosh Tepa canal, a mega-project designed to irrigate 560,000 hectares of farmland in northern Afghanistan. Experts say it could divert up to 21 per cent of the Amu Darya’s flow, a river already vital for water-stressed Central Asian states. Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, backed by Kazakhstan, have raised alarms that the project could further shrink the Aral Sea and destabilise the region’s water-sharing arrangements, which date back to the Soviet era.Water governance specialist Mohd Faizee cautioned and was quoted by AFP as saying, “No matter how friendly the tone is now, at some point there will be consequences for Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan when the canal starts operating.”Taliban officials, however, insist the canal will not cause significant harm. Project manager Sayed Zabihullah Miri was cited by AFP as saying that the Amu Darya has “an abundance of water, especially when it floods and glacial meltwater flows into it”.They argue the project is critical to boosting food security in a country where climate-driven crop failures and humanitarian crises remain widespread.Iran, Afghanistan’s western neighbour, is the only country with a formal water-sharing treaty, signed in 1973 over the Helmand river. But the accord has never been fully honoured. Tehran frequently accuses Kabul of restricting flows through upstream dams, especially during droughts.The Taliban maintain that water scarcity, worsened by climate change, leaves them unable to release more.A report by the Afghanistan Analysts Network noted that Afghan authorities also believe they have long been denied their fair share of Helmand waters due to poor management and political neglect.Meanwhile, disputes also simmer over the Harirud basin, which flows into Iran and Turkmenistan, where Afghanistan recently inaugurated the Pashdan dam. Analysts say reduced security risks after the war could accelerate such projects, reshaping regional water dynamics.To the east, Afghanistan shares the Kabul river basin with Pakistan, which eventually feeds into the Indus. Unlike Iran, no treaty exists between the two neighbours. While water disputes have not dominated their rocky bilateral relations, Kabul’s attempts to revive old river projects and build new ones could trigger friction.Yet, Afghanistan’s financial struggles and lack of technical expertise mean most large-scale projects will take years to complete. This delay may ease immediate diplomatic concerns, but for Afghans grappling with severe water shortages in the capital and beyond, the wait could deepen suffering.Afghanistan’s water disputes cannot be separated from the worsening climate emergency. According to the UN’s International Organisation for Migration (IOM), nearly five million people were affected by floods, droughts, and other climate shocks in early 2025, with almost 400,000 displaced.“Crop failure, dry pastures and vanishing water sources are pushing rural communities to the edge,” the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation warned in July.Villagers in the north were quoted by AFP as saying that they were pinning hopes on the Qosh Tepa canal to revive farming, though its completion is still more than a year away. In contrast, communities in western Herat have watched the Harirud river run dry, forcing families who were deported from Iran to return to barren land with little to farm.Meanwhile, extreme rainfall has added another layer of crisis. Warmer temperatures mean heavier downpours, often triggering devastating flash floods. In Maidan Wardak, a community leader said, “I’m around 54 years old, and we have never experienced problems like this before.”Taliban officials admit their efforts fall short. Energy and water minister Abdul Latif Mansoor recently conceded that while canal and dam projects are underway, “the measures we have taken so far are not enough”.Limited funding, international isolation and restrictive governance have left Afghanistan struggling to cope with climate shocks, even as it faces one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises.For millions of Afghans, everything now comes down to water, too little in times of drought, too much during floods, as the Taliban’s push for control over rivers becomes a defining issue for the country and its neighbours alike.","Afghanistan is moving to assert sovereignty over its water resources, a shift that is testing fragile ties with neighbouring countries.

A United Nations-backed investigator has revealed disturbing evidence of “systemic torture” inside Myanmar’s detention centres, describing electric shocks, strangulations, gang rape and the burning of sexual body parts among the abuses that were documented over the past year.Nicholas Koumjian, head of the international independent team investigating atrocities in the country, spoke as the group released its latest annual report on Tuesday, covering the 12 months to 30 June.The country has been in turmoil since February 2021, ever since the army overthrew Aung San Suu Kyi’s elected government, sparking a civil war. As peaceful protests were crushed with lethal force, those opposing military rule took up arms.Since then, conflict has engulfed large parts of Myanmar.The investigative team, as quoted by AP, said that it had made progress in identifying security personnel involved in detention operations, as well as “perpetrators who have summarily executed captured combatants or civilians accused of being informers.”These perpetrators included members of the security forces, affiliated militias and opposition armed groups.The report details the ""documented torture in Myanmar’s detention facilities which includes beatings, electric shocks, strangulations, gang rape, burning of sexual body parts and other forms of sexual violence,"" according to a summary of the findings.“Our report highlights a continued increase in the frequency and brutality of atrocities committed in Myanmar,” Koumjian said. “We are working towards the day when the perpetrators will have to answer for their actions in a court of law.”“We have uncovered significant evidence, including eyewitness testimony, showing systematic torture in Myanmar detention facilities,” he further added.The team also launched new investigations into atrocities committed in Rakhine state, where the military and the Arakan Army, an opposition force, are battling for control.Rakhine has long been the scene of grave abuses. More than 700,000 people from the Rohingya minority fled to neighbouring Bangladesh in 2017 to escape persecution. About 70,000 more crossed the border last year after the Arakan Army effectively seized control of the territory.The Independent Investigative Mechanism on Myanmar has been operating since 2018 under a mandate from the UN-backed Human Rights Council to document human rights abuses and violations in the country.It has already shared evidence with authorities pursuing cases involving the Rohingya at the International Criminal Court and the UN’s International Court of Justice.","U.N.-backed team releases annual report covering the 12 months to 30 June.

‘Sweating and babbling’: British Airways flight attendant found naked and high on drugs mid-flight; probe under way,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/sweating-and-babbling-british-airways-flight-attendant-found-naked-and-high-on-drugs-mid-flight-probe-under-way/articleshow/123483305.cms,"PTI file photo





A British Airways flight attendant was found naked and high on drugs in an onboard toilet during a flight from California to London. Described as “sweating” and “babbling,” he became agitated and was stood down by the flight’s manager after failing to assist with pre-flight safety checks.A subsequent blood test showed that Haden Pentecost, 41, had both methamphetamine and amphetamines in his system, reported the BBC.After complaining of stomach pain and saying he needed to change clothes, Pentecost locked himself inside a toilet. A colleague later discovered him there and, unaware of his state, before dressing him and moving him to an empty seat, the court heard.A health professional was called after the flight captain spoke to the flight attendant.Pentecost showed dilated pupils and an elevated heart rate, requiring checks every 20 minutes until the flight landed at Heathrow. Paramedics took him to the hospital, where a blood test was conducted.Witnesses described him as incoherent and erratic, muttering meaningless phrases. While reports suggest he had previously been investigated for unspecified conduct, this was his most serious breach yet, as cited by Aviation A2Z.He has since been dismissed by the Airways, and investigations are underway.He appeared at Uxbridge Magistrates’ Court on Friday and pleaded guilty to performing an aviation function while impaired by drugs. The attendant from Basingstoke was granted bail ahead of sentencing at Isleworth Crown Court at a later date.He was reportedly employed by the Airways in 2018.","British Airways flight attendant Haden Pentecost, 41, was found naked and high on drugs in an onboard toilet during a flight from California to London.

"Movement signatures: How we move, gesture, use facial expressions is unique; could be as different as fingerprint",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/movement-signatures-how-we-move-gesture-use-facial-expressions-could-be-as-unique-as-fingerprint/articleshow/123483187.cms,"



MANCHESTER: The way someone walks, talks, smiles, or gestures gives a clue to who they are. Whether through the flick of an eyebrow, the rhythm of our walk, or the tilt of a head, movement speaks volumes.And my recent paper shows that people may have their own movement fingerprint. This is a style of movement that is characteristic of a person's identity. So, someone who uses expressive facial gestures might also speak with animated hand movements or walk with a lively gait. These consistencies could form a motion fingerprint that is unique to the individual.First, let's explore how faces move and why this matters.Everyone has their own style of moving their face, for example, how they raise an eyebrow, purse their lips, or squint when laughing. These patterns of movement help us recognise familiar people even when the visual quality is poor, such as in low lighting or from a distance. And as a person becomes more familiar to us, we become tuned to the way they move, learning their unique patterns of motion, just like we remember their face or voice.Human faces are constantly in motion; they blink, smile, grimace and talk, to name a few movements. Researchers categorise facial motion into rigid movements (such as turning or nodding the head) and non-rigid movements (like expressing emotion or speaking). It's the non-rigid movements that tend to be most personally distinctive.The way we gesture with our hands, shift our posture and tilt our heads all carry identity information. Gestures are often shaped by personal habits or cultural norms; for example, someone might habitually nod three times when agreeing, or use a distinctive hand wave common in their home country.Facial movements are synchronised with the way we sound. When we talk, our face plays a role in shaping the sound of our voice. For example, if you talk with a wide open mouth, your speech sounds deeper and richer. Studies show that people can match other people's voices to moving faces more accurately than to static ones. This suggests that dynamic cues to identity are present in the movement of the face and the sound of the voice.People with face recognition difficulties (those who are ""face blind"" or prosopagnosic) may be better at recognising moving faces than still ones. Typically, people who are face blind can see faces and the differences between them, but struggle to link the face to a specific person. Here, idiosyncratic information from movement can provide an additional clue to identity.Gait, a person's walking style, is one of the most studied body movements. Early research, such as a 2005 study, investigated participants' recognition of identity from gait using point-light displays. In this case, bright spots (lights) were placed on key areas of a person's body. All other visual cues were removed. Participants could only see bright spots against a dark background. The study found participants could tell fairly well who someone was from the way the spots moved.Characteristics such as stride length, limb movement, posture and pace form a consistent motion pattern that is unique and surprisingly difficult to fake, making gait analysis a reliable clue for identifying people.Movement fingerprintsMy review brought together evidence from behavioural and brain imaging studies to consider if such consistencies between different types of motion exist and how we might explore this phenomenon further. The paper proposes that people have an overall style of movement.More work needs to be done to find direct evidence of movement fingerprints. For example, we still aren't sure what part of the brain processes these movement-based identity cues.So far, research shows that the posterior temporal sulcus - an area of the brain located roughly above your ear on each side - responds not just to faces and bodies, but to how someone moves more generally. This area is active when we hear voices or see people speak, suggesting it may help link motion and sound. Also, this region plays a key role in allowing us to understand our social world, interpreting other people's actions, determining where they are looking, and picking up on social cues such as gestures, facial expressions and changes in gaze direction.However, it's probably just one part of a larger brain network involved in recognising others through motion.Real-world applicationsMotion-based identity traits aren't as stable or specific as fingerprints or DNA. They're what researchers call soft biometrics: useful but not always accurate.But as we better understand the link between motion and identity, exciting real-world applications are emerging.Motion analysis could support contactless identity verification from gait-based authentication at airports to gesture-based identification in smart environments, such as homes that respond to a user's unique movement patterns. In clinical settings, movement analysis might help support people with social cognition impairments, face recognition or movement issues. For example, helping a doctor identify changes in the way a patient produces non-verbal cues.But many questions remain. We still aren't sure how consistent motion fingerprints are as someone gets older and in different contexts. Individual differences in people and environmental factors like lighting, clothing or stress could affect them.Researchers also aren't sure how exactly we manage to understand all this movement in everyday life without even thinking about it.Figuring this out could not only help improve technologies like social robots and develop tools for people with recognition and communication difficulties, but also tell us more about how we process and react to other people.

‘Restrict freedom outside jail too’: UK Labour govt cracks down on criminals; offenders may face ban from public venues,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/restrict-freedom-outside-jail-too-uk-labour-govt-cracks-down-on-criminals-offenders-may-face-ban-from-public-venues/articleshow/123481169.cms,"Secretary of state for justice Shabana Mahmood





UK government could introduce new laws to bar Criminals in England and Wales from pubs, sports grounds and concerts under new government plans, aimed at giving judges powers to impose tougher community sentences.Secretary of state for justice Shabana Mahmood said “should remind all offenders that, under this government, crime does not pay.”""I am clear that if you break our laws, for whatever crime, you should lose your liberty – whether you are serving your sentence inside prison, or outside it. That’s why this Government will give courts new powers to hand down tough community sentences that restrict the freedoms of offenders outside of jail too"", Mirror UK reported.The proposals would expand restrictions on offenders’ freedom to include driving limits, travel bans and confinement to specific zones. The rules could also apply to prisoners released on licence, with drug testing extended to all those leaving prison, not only those with prior substance misuse.Currently, judges can impose limited bans linked to specific offences, such as football banning orders for crimes inside stadiums.The new plan would allow such bans to be applied to any offence.“When criminals break society's rules, they must be punished. These new punishments should remind all offenders that crime does not pay,” Mahmood said, stressing that the public expects the government to do “everything in its power to keep Britain safe.”The measures are part of Labour’s wider push to tackle prison overcrowding. In June, the government began transferring inmates to lower security jails to ease pressure on the system.Earlier this month, Sky News reported that the prison system had been close to collapse several times between autumn 2023 and summer 2024. The review pointed to a systemic problem causing recurring capacity crises over the last 18 years.","Proposals would expand restrictions on offenders’ freedom to include driving limits, travel bans and confinement to specific zones.

‘Criminal behaviour’: UK police officer jailed for stealing woman’s underwear during home search; ‘why did he want them’ asks victim,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/criminal-behaviour-uk-police-officer-jailed-for-stealing-womans-underwear-during-home-search-why-did-he-want-them-asks-victim/articleshow/123430737.cms,"Image: X@/vpopulimedia





An on-duty officer who was caught on camera stealing a woman’s underwear during a home search in September last year has been jailed.The officer, identified as Marcin Zielinski, 47, serving with Hertfordshire Police, conducted the Section 32 search.CCTV footage from the woman’s home from last year shows Zielinski slipping a pair of underwear into his back pocket before walking out of the room. The woman released the footage on Monday after the officer was sentenced to four months in prison for the corrupt and improper use of police power and privileges.""Zielinski has let down the public of Hertfordshire, the police service as a whole, and his former colleagues, who act with professionalism and integrity,” Genna Telfer, the assistant chief constable of Hertfordshire Constabulary, was quoted as saying by the BBC.""His criminal behaviour damages the reputation of policing and represents a fundamental betrayal of the public and the values for which the police service stands,"" she said.The woman said she felt so “violated” by the incident that she discarded all her underwear and the chest of drawers, which had become a constant reminder of the distressing footage.“I'm constantly thinking, what did he want them for? Why did he take them? What's he going to do with them? How many more people has he done it to?” the woman was quoted as saying by the Daily Mail.On the night of the incident, the woman was arrested over an unrelated matter but later released without charges. While she was in custody, her partner came across the ring doorbell footage and was shocked by what he witnessed.""On the footage he signals to the other guy, 'I've searched this room, go and search the other room’. So he sent the other officer out and that's when he proceeded to open the drawer and stick them in his back pocket,"" the woman’s partner was quoted as saying by the Daily Mail.The woman feels that Zielinski’s sentence was too lenient and that he should serve a longer term in jail.""Originally I thought it was just going to get a suspended sentence, because I really did not think they were going to take it seriously. But I do think he does deserve to see the law from the other side. He can't just have the power trip to get away with it,"" she said.","Hertfordshire Police officer Marcin Zielinski, 47, was caught on camera stealing a woman's underwear during a home search in September last year.

Key points at a glance

Move to Forest Lodge planned for later this year (property not officially confirmed).

Eight bedrooms, Georgian era, private setting in Windsor Great Park (tennis court, period interiors).

Long-term base: reports suggest they intend to remain there even when William is king.

Funding: rent and renovations to be covered privately.

Other homes: Kensington Palace (work) and Anmer Hall (weekends) remain in use.

Note: There has been no formal public announcement naming Forest Lodge as the future royal residence once William is king. The picture above reflects consistent reporting across multiple outlets and the confirmed plan to move house this year.





Prince William and Kate Middleton plan to move into Forest Lodge in Windsor Great Park later this year. Reports suggest the family intend to keep it as their main home even when William becomes king. There’s no official confirmation of the specific property; Palace aides have only said the Wales family will move house later this year.Forest Lodge is an eight-bedroom Georgian house with the privacy and space the family has not had at Adelaide Cottage. Photos and records show period details inside and a tennis court on the grounds, with a quiet, wooded setting inside the park. People’s interiors coverage has highlighted archived images—fireplaces, Venetian windows and detailed ceilings—from an early-2000s shoot that give a sense of the house’s character.A move before Christmas remains the working assumption if refurbishment keeps pace. Reporting points to a handover before year’s end, but the timing will depend on the house being ready.The choice fits how they live now. The children attend school near Windsor, and Eton College is close for Prince George when the time comes. Staying based in the park keeps school runs simple and daily life steady.There is also a clean-slate feel. The past stretch has been difficult for the wider family.A move to a larger home in the same area offers routine without fresh upheaval.Forest Lodge would mark a shift from old habits. The monarch has long been linked to Buckingham Palace as a primary base. The plan here is different: Prince William and Kate Middleton are expected to keep using London and other palaces for work, while home life stays in Windsor. Ongoing renovation work at Buckingham Palace adds a practical reason to keep the family settled where they are.Money matters appear straightforward. Coverage says the couple will fund rent and current renovations privately, drawing on William’s income from the Duchy of Cornwall. The goal is a family home first, with formal spaces available when needed.They will still hold on to other places. Kensington Palace remains their London base for duties. Anmer Hall in Norfolk stays as a country retreat. Forest Lodge would sit at the center of that small triangle.Practical details are still emerging. Reports describe a preference for limited live-in staff and separate quarters for their longtime nanny—consistent with the low-key way they have run the household in recent years. The property is large enough to place security and help at a distance from family rooms.The move is not yet complete. Work on the house continues, and any relocation would also require arrangements typical for residences on Crown land. The family will make the switch when it is ready. If the plan holds, Forest Lodge becomes the anchor now and in the future, while official palaces remain the stage for state work. The idea is simple: keep the children’s routines intact and handle the Crown’s business where it belongs.","Prince William and Kate Middleton plan to move into Forest Lodge in Windsor Great Park later this year.

Britain agrees to drop mandate for Apple to provide 'back door',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/britain-agrees-to-drop-mandate-for-apple-to-provide-back-door/articleshow/123395824.cms,"Representative Image





SAN FRANCISCO: The Trump administration has reached an agreement with Britain to spare Apple from a request that the company create a tool to give British law enforcement organisations access to customers' cloud data.Tulsi Gabbard, US director of national intelligence, said Monday night that Britain had ""agreed to drop its mandate for Apple to provide a 'back door' that would have enabled access to the protected encrypted data of American citizens and encroached on our civil liberties.""Britain's decision to back off the policy comes after Apple spent months lobbying officials in Washington and rolled back an encrypted storage feature for British users. In the face of govt pressure around the world, the company has been resolute that it won't create a back door that allows access to phones or encrypted user data because it is afraid such a tool could be abused.Much of Apple's predicament in Britain played out in private after the govt issued a secret order this year. The request came after Britain amended its Investigatory Powers Act of 2016, which allows it to compel companies to turn over data and communications to law enforcement and intelligence agencies.Apple helped make the secret order public by declaring in Feb that iPhone users in Britain would begin seeing messages on their phones saying the company no longer offered its Advanced Data Protection feature. The capability, which remained available in the US, had allowed British users to encrypt almost all of their iCloud data, including messages,notes, photos and backups.Gabbard said Britain's agreement would ""ensure Americans' private data remains private and our Constitutional rights and civil liberties are protected."" nyt",Britain dropped a request for Apple to create a tool to give law enforcement access to customers' cloud data.

Royal Navy gets its first Hindu chaplain,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/royal-navy-gets-its-first-hindu-chaplain/articleshow/123394957.cms,"The UK's Royal Navy has appointed Bhanu Attri as its first-ever Hindu chaplain. (PTI Photo)





LONDON: A pandit raised in India has become the Royal Navy’s first ever Hindu chaplain.Bhanu Attri (39), who grew up in Himachal Pradesh but now lives in Essex, formally passed out of Britannia Royal Naval College in Dartmouth last week and is also the Royal Navy’s first non-Christian chaplain.He was one of two chaplains and 148 new Royal Navy officers to pass out.Chaplains offer religious, pastoral, welfare and moral support to any member of the naval service, regardless of faith, who need it either at a base, or on ships and submarines. Attri, a Hindu priest with decades of experience running a Hindu temple in London, will also offer Hindu prayer ceremonies for Hindus.There are around 40 Hindu personnel serving full-time in the Royal Navy, plus another 30 in the Maritime Reserves. In the UK military, as a whole, there are more than 1,550 Hindus serving full-time, mostly in the army.Whilst most cadets underwent 29 weeks of training, he underwent a slightly different 13-week course: six weeks of officer instruction, which included learning about the Royal Navy’s worldwide role, its present-day mission, and how to survive a sinking ship; four weeks at sea, and three weeks focused on the role of a military chaplain.Bhanu will now join the chaplaincy at HMS Drake, serving the thousands of personnel working in and around Devonport Naval Base, ashore and at sea.“Passing out from Britannia Royal Naval College to become the first ever Hindu chaplain in the fleet is a profound honour,” Attri said. “The chance to represent individuals from other diverse religions brings meaningful representation for the Hindu community and reflects the Navy’s commitment to diversity, inclusion, and spiritual care for all. My family feels immense pride.”Anil Bhanot, Hindu adviser to the ministry of defence (MoD), said: “In 2023 the Royal Navy created a position for a Hindu chaplain and I endorsed Pandit Bhanu Prakash Attri for best fitting the criteria. He has qualifications from India equivalent to a Sanskrit scriptural postgraduate degree.” Bhanot said he wanted to encourage more Hindu youth to join the British armed forces.“Although our spiritual Bhoomi is India, our Karma-Bhoomi is the UK and MoD represents our protective arm,” he said.","Bhanu Attri (39), who grew up in Himachal Pradesh but now lives in Essex, formally passed out of Britannia Royal Naval College in Dartmouth last week.

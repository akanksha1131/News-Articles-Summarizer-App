US President Donald Trump on Sunday suggested a new way for Russia to avoid the sanctions, and that is to get a deal ""where people stop getting killed.""Trump on Friday warned Russia with new sanctions over the Ukraine war. He said, ""Russia -- I think it's disgusting what they're doing. I think it's disgusting,"" AFP quoted Trump saying. ""We're going to put sanctions. I don't know that sanctions bother him,"" he added.While talking with reporters, Trump said that in both the countries Russia and Ukraine a lot of people are being killed. He claimed that in Ukraine the number of deaths are lower than Russia.""Yeah, get a deal where people stop getting killed. They had a number that just came out that a tremendous number of Russian soldiers are being killed. And likewise Ukraine, a lower number, but still thousands and thousands of people. And now we're adding towns where they're being hit by missiles.

Eight million people dead. At least that's what they have. But I think the number is much higher. And the leaders of each country, Rwanda and the Congo, they were great. They were great and they wanted it stopped. 31 years it went on. We stopped a lot of wars. Serbia, Kosovo was going to be happening, and I don't believe it will now. So we stopped.

Facing limited diplomatic options to resolve the hostage crisis, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is advocating for a “military solution” to secure the release of the remaining hostages held by Hamas, an Israeli official was quoted as saying by ABC News on Sunday.Netanyahu has proposed expanding military operations in Gaza, aiming to use force to rescue approximately 20 hostages still believed to be alive since their capture during Hamas’s attack on October 7, 2023.The official said that there is an increasing understanding within the Israeli leadership that Hamas is not interested in making a deal for the officials, reports ABC News.""Therefore, prime minister Netanyahu is pushing to expand military operations to release the hostages through a military solution,"" said the official.Tens of thousands gathered in the coastal city of Tel Aviv on Saturday to demand that Netanyahu’s government secure the release of the remaining hostages.""They are on the absolute brink of death,"" said Ilay David, the brother of Evyatar David, whose video was released by Hamas showing him in what he described as digging his own grave.

Russiagate: Tulsi Gabbard says Russia believed Hillary Clinton's 2016 victory 'inevitable'; claims Obama admin orchestrated hoax,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/russiagate-tulsi-gabbard-says-russia-believed-hillary-clintons-2016-victory-inevitable-claims-obama-admin-orchestrated-hoax/articleshow/123084080.cms,"Tulsi Gabbard (PTI)





Director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has claimed that Russian officials privately anticipated a Hillary Clinton victory was “inevitable” in the 2016 US presidential election, based on her assessment of recently released documents by her office.Speaking on Miranda Devine’s “Pod Force One” podcast, Gabbard has said that Russia had a strategy of undermining public trust in the American political system while preparing for a Clinton-based White House, despite the prevailing narrative that Russia was in support of Donald Trump “It surprised me that all of these documents still existed, quite frankly,” she said on an episode that is scheduled to release on Wednesday, reports the New York Post. “As we’ve learned in later documents that we’ve reviewed throughout that campaign, Russia believed that Hillary Clinton would win the election.“They felt it was inevitable,” she added.Tulsi Gabbard’s office last month began releasing a series of internal documents detailing how officials navigated the investigation into Russian interference during the 2016 elections.Among the disclosures was a 2020 House Intelligence Committee report, which alleged that Russian operatives may have obtained intelligence suggesting Hillary Clinton was “placed on a daily regimen of ‘heavy tranquilizers’” and was “afraid of losing.”“If Russia aspired to help Trump get elected, which is what the manufactured January 2017 intelligence community assessment says with high confidence, according to Brennan and Clapper, then Putin would have released the most damaging information and emails to help President Trump,” she said, questioning why the alleged Russian intelligence was never made public if Moscow truly had a goal to uplift Trump’s campaign.“It was intentionally withheld and not released because they assumed that Hillary Clinton would win that election, and their plan,” Gabbard said, reports the New York Post.Much of the material released by Gabbard focuses on challenging the findings of a 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment (ICA), which asserted, among other conclusions, that “the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump.”Gabbard accused former President Obama of ordering the 2017 ICA of Russian interference in the 2016 election, highlighting the actions of his administration, outlined in the newly released documents.“Out of respect for the office of the presidency, our office does not normally dignify the constant nonsense and misinformation flowing out of this White House with a response. But these claims are outrageous enough to merit one,” a spokesperson for Obama said, slamming the revelations made by Gabbard.“These bizarre allegations are ridiculous and a weak attempt at distraction. Nothing in the document issued last week undercuts the widely accepted conclusion that Russia worked to influence the 2016 presidential election but did not successfully manipulate any votes,"" said the Spokesperson.","Director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has claimed that Russian officials privately anticipated a Hillary Clinton victory was “inevitable” in the 2016 US presidential election. “It surprised me that all of these documents still existed, quite frankly,” she said on an episode that is scheduled to release on Wednesday.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123084128,imgsize-958982,width-400,resizemode-4/123084128.jpg"
‘They want a win in November’: Trump administration schedules first ‘Golden Dome’ test ahead of 2028 election -Here's what report said,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/they-want-a-win-in-november-trump-administration-schedules-first-golden-dome-test-ahead-of-2028-election-heres-what-report-said/articleshow/123083700.cms,"



The Pentagon has scheduled its first major test of President Donald Trump's space-based Golden Dome missile defence system just before the 2028 elections, CNN reported, citing sources.This ambitious schedule aims to demonstrate the feasibility of transforming President Trump's concept of a space-based protective shield for the entire United States.This scheduling aligns with Trump's May announcement to “have it done in three years.”""Once fully constructed, the Golden Dome will be capable of intercepting missiles even if they are launched from other sides of the world,"" he said.A defence official informed CNN that while missile tests typically require extensive advance planning, the timing of this test in the fourth quarter of 2028 appears strategically placed.""They want a win to point to in November [2028],” the official told CNN and added, “and DoD wants to avoid anything they perceive will slow them down.”The defence official revealed that the MDA plans to designate the test as FTI-X, where 'FTI' indicates Flight Test Integrated, encompassing the coordination of Golden Dome's various sensors and weapons systems against multiple targets.The three-year implementation presents significant challenges, considering the US has researched space-based missile interception for decades.The defence official highlighted technical complexities, particularly regarding the substantial number of satellites required for effective coverage of the continental United States.Space Force Gen. Michael Guetlein, appointed by Trump in May to oversee Golden Dome's development, addressed these challenges at a recent industry summit, focusing on the technical and economic feasibility of space-based interceptors at scale.Initial tests in 2028 may represent only the first phase, according to another source, emphasising the current focus on swift progress using existing systems to demonstrate the concept's viability for additional funding.The project's allocated budget of $25 billion, announced by Trump in May, is expected to expand significantly into hundreds of billions. Various companies are already testing relevant technologies, including Northrop Grumman's work on space-based interceptors.The Pentagon recently announced successful testing of a Lockheed Martin long-range radar system in Alaska, capable of tracking ballistic missiles from Russia and China, likely to be incorporated into Golden Dome.The industry awaits Guetlein's comprehensive system design plan. A memo signed by defence secretary Pete Hegseth outlined a 60-day deadline for initial architecture and 120 days for implementation planning.Concerns exist regarding the accelerated development approach and reduced oversight. The Office of the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation's role was diminished after announcing its involvement in Golden Dome testing oversight.Guetlein has been granted significant autonomy in contract allocation and technology procurement, reporting directly to Deputy Secretary Stephen Feinberg. The programme operates outside standard Pentagon oversight procedures for major weapons systems.Multiple companies, notably SpaceX, Anduril, and Palantir, are competing for involvement, having presented directly to Hegseth, who has expressed interest in their proposals.",The Pentagon has scheduled its first major test of President Donald Trump's space-based Golden Dome missile defence system just before the 2028 elections.

Trump Rages At Schumer As Senate Talks Collapse, Nominations And Budget Face Gridlock





US President Trump launched a scathing attack on senate minority leader Chuck Schumer on Saturday, telling him to “GO TO HELL” after the Senate left Washington for its August recess without confirming over 130 of his executive branch nominees.A deal between Republicans and Democrats collapsed, and many key appointments remain stalled. Trump had urged the Senate to stay in session, but negotiations failed— leaving dozens of political appointees in limbo and the president fuming.“Senator Cryin’ Chuck Schumer is demanding over One Billion Dollars in order to approve a small number of our highly qualified nominees, who should right now be helping to run our Country,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social.Trump was reacting to what he described as an unreasonable demand by Senate Democrats, accusing Schumer of tying nominee approvals to a $1 billion funding request, reported The New York Post.“This demand is egregious and unprecedented, and would be embarrassing to the Republican Party if it were accepted. It is political extortion, by any other name. Tell Schumer, who is under tremendous political pressure from within his own party, the Radical Left Lunatics, to GO TO HELL!” he addedTrump followed up with urging Republicans to hold firm and use the recess to rally public support, rather than accepting a compromise with Democrats.“Do not accept the offer, go home and explain to your constituents what bad people the Democrats are, and what a great job the Republicans are doing, and have done, for our Country. Have a great RECESS and, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!”Senate majority leader John Thune acknowledged the failed negotiations and the multiple attempts to reach an agreement with Schumer before recess. “There were several different times where I think either or both sides maybe thought there was a deal in the end.”Thune had been working with Schumer on a proposal to bundle nominee votes into two rounds—one before the recess and another afterward. But Democrats were reportedly seeking guarantees from Trump to restore funding for foreign aid and the National Institutes of Health, which the administration had frozen.The breakdown led to frustration on both sides, and senators were eager to begin their August break.Schumer, under pressure from his party’s progressive base, later celebrated the failure of the confirmation deal.“Let me clear what happened: Donald Trump attempted to steamroll the Senate to put in place his historically unqualified nominees. But Senate Democrats wouldn’t let him,” he said in a post on X Sunday.“Donald Trump’s style: Posture[,] Cajole[,] Stamp your feet… and then give up,” he added in a follow up post.With the deal dead, some Republicans suggested changing Senate rules to prevent Democrats from blocking confirmations. However, moderate GOP senators were reluctant, fearing the same rules could be used against them in the future.Thune allowed the Senate to continue holding pro forma sessions, ceremonial meetings that block Trump from making recess appointments, ensuring his nominees cannot be confirmed without Senate votes. Although the Senate passed three of twelve required appropriations bills, several key funding bills remain stuck in committee.According to senate appropriations chair Susan Collins, it marks the first time since 2018 that any funding bills were passed before the August recess. If the remaining bills aren’t approved by October 1, the government faces a partial shutdown, The New York Post reported.","US President Donald Trump launched a scathing attack on senate minority leader Chuck Schumer.

""Euphoria"" star Sydney Sweeney is once again trending online, this time for her impressive skills at the shooting range.A short video of 27-year-old actress Sydney Sweeney showing off her handgun skills has gone viral, with social media users impressed by her sharp aim and quick shooting.In the clip, Sydney can be seen dressed casually with earmuffs on. She is seen confidently loading and firing a Glock.Her steady stance and tight shot groupings had many online saying she looked like a pro, not a first-timer. Netizens reacted quickly as the video of Sydney Sweeney at a shooting range circulated online.One user reposted the video and wrote, ""Sydney Sweeney has insane handgun skills.""While another user reposted saying, ""She doesn’t just have great jeans; she's also a total pro at the firing range, unloading 17 rounds in just 9 seconds,"" referring to her recent American Eagle campaign.The video’s buzz comes in the midst of online backlash over Sweeney’s American Eagle ad, which has been criticised for its messaging and portrayal.The ad, which features Sweeney in a classic Americana setting fixing a car and wearing denim. Then, she uses red paint to change the word “genes” to “jeans” and says in a voiceover: “Genes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality and even eye color.My jeans are blue.”The tagline read “Sydney Sweeney has great jeans” plays on the word “genes,” which many critics found problematic.Some accused the campaign of being overly sexualised and promoting outdated beauty standards, pointing to the focus on Sweeney’s blonde hair, blue eyes, and slim physique.Others went further, interpreting the wordplay as an unintended reference to eugenics, a theory historically used to promote racial superiority.Earlier on Friday, American Eagle in response issued a statement on Instagram saying the campaign “is and always was about the jeans. Her jeans. Her story. We'll continue to celebrate how everyone wears their AE jeans with confidence, their way.”The brand emphasised that their message celebrates confidence and individuality, saying, “Great jeans look good on everyone.”While critics debated the ad’s deeper implications, marketing experts noted that the attention, positive or negative has certainly kept both Sweeney and American Eagle in the spotlight.",A short video of Sydney Sweeney showing off her handgun skills has gone viral.

Federal officials have launched an investigation into former special counsel Jack Smith after US President Donald Trump and Republican lawmakers accused him of engaging in illegal political activity during his investigations into Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign.The US office of special counsel (OSC), an independent federal agency, confirmed to NBC News on Saturday that it is looking into Smith for possible violations of the Hatch Act- a law that bars certain political activities by federal employees.The OSC is distinct from the justice department’s special counsel’s office, which Smith led during his investigation into Trump.While the OSC cannot bring criminal charges, it can recommend disciplinary action such as removal from the federal workforce. It may also refer findings to the Department of Justice, although that is uncommon.Senator Tom Cotton, R-Ark., formally requested the investigation on Wednesday, accusing Smith of “unprecedented interference in the 2024 election.”Smith was appointed special counsel by then-attorney general Merrick Garland in November 2022, just three days after Trump announced his presidential bid. He later brought two criminal indictments against Trump in 2023 but stepped down from the role slightly more than a week before Trump’s inauguration in January 2024.Neither case reached trial.“Jack Smith’s legal actions were nothing more than a tool for the Biden and Harris campaigns,” Cotton said in a post on X Wednesday. “This isn’t just unethical, it is very likely illegal campaign activity from a public office.”Cotton also claimed Smith pushed for a “rushed trial” of Trump, though he has not released specific evidence of illegal conduct.Hatch Act violations are rarely referred to the DOJ. In 2019, the OSC recommended then-President Trump remove White House counselor Kellyanne Conway for Hatch Act violations, but the issue did not lead to prosecution.Meanwhile, Trump’s nominee to lead the OSC, Paul Ingrassia, remains stalled in the senate. A White House official said that Ingrassia, a former podcast host with a history of controversial remarks, is currently holding one-on-one meetings with senators as part of the confirmation process.","Federal officials have launched an investigation into former special counsel Jack Smith.

Tampa Bay Buccaneers player Desmond Watson is in a very challenging position due to his weight. Here, July 2025, the team's training camp is already well under way in Tampa, Florida. At around 450 pounds, Desmond Watson is still not allowed to participate in team activities. You can almost feel how much he wants to play as he walks laps under the hot sun.

'Disgraceful': Ex-South Korea president Yoon Suk Yeol resists questioning by laying down in underwear; delays probe into martial law plot,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/disgraceful-ex-south-korea-president-yoon-suk-yeol-resists-questioning-by-laying-down-in-underwear-delays-probe-into-martial-law-plot/articleshow/123077586.cms,"South Korea's impeached former president Yoon Suk Yeol (Image credits: PTI)





South Korea's impeached former president Yoon Suk Yeol lay on the floor of his prison cell wearing only an undershirt and boxer shorts to resist questioning, prosecutors said Friday, after a fresh attempt to bring him in for interrogation over election tampering allegations failed.Although already in custody on charges related to his attempt to impose martial law in December, prosecutors were required to serve a new warrant to question him in a separate case involving his wife, Kim Keon-hee.Assistant special prosecutor Oh Jeong-hee said a team of special prosecutors attempted to execute the warrant but were forced to abandon the effort after Yoon refused to cooperate.“The special prosecutors urged him to voluntarily comply with the arrest warrant, taking into account his status as a former president,” Oh said as quoted by South China Morning Post. “But the suspect persistently refused, remaining on the floor and declining to put on his prison uniform.”Prosecutors repeated the request four times over 20- to 30-minute intervals before halting the operation after two hours, citing concerns that using physical force might lead to harm.“During the process, the suspect was informed that the next attempt to execute the warrant would proceed even with the use of physical force,” Oh added.She noted that Yoon had long championed “rule of law, fairness, and common sense,” adding, “The public is closely watching whether the law is applied equally to all. We hope the suspect, who once served as a prosecutor, prosecutor general and president, will respect and comply with legal procedures.”Jhee Byong-kuen, a political science professor at Chosun University, criticised Yoon’s actions. “No criminal defies the rule of law in such a disgraceful way,” he said, as cited by South China Morning Post. “The former leader is showing no remorse and portraying himself as a victim of political persecution.”Yoon was first arrested on January 15 by the corruption investigation office for high-ranking officials on charges of insurrection and abuse of power. He was released after 52 days due to procedural issues, but rearrested on July 10 on new charges, including obstruction of official duties. Since then, he has refused to leave his cell for questioning. Prosecutors later added charges, alleging he instructed his security team to interfere with his earlier arrest.He is also resisting a separate probe into alleged election meddling involving his wife. The couple is accused of influencing People Power Party nominations for local and National Assembly elections.In April, the Constitutional Court upheld Yoon’s impeachment, originally passed by the National Assembly in response to the martial law attempt.","South Korea's impeached former president Yoon Suk Yeol lay on the floor of his prison cell wearing only an undershirt and boxer shorts to resist questioning, prosecutors said.

Two days after President Donald Trump fired the top labour official in charge of compiling statistics on employment, Kevin Hassett, the director of the White House National Economic Council, insisted on Sunday that the administration was ""absolutely not"" shooting the messenger on the heels of a poor jobs report. But Hassett repeatedly declined to furnish detailed evidence that would substantiate the president's claims that the data had been rigged or manipulated to hurt him politically. Trump cited that justification in his decision to fire Erika McEntarfer, the commissioner of the Bureau of Labour Statistics(BLS), in a widely rebuked move on Friday.""The president wants his own people there, so that when we see the numbers, they're more transparent and more reliable,"" Hassett told NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" explaining at one point that the president sought to ensure jobs numbers could be ""trusted."" In a second appearance, on ""Fox News Sunday,"" Hassett claimed there were ""partisan patterns"" in the jobless data, and said that ""data can't be propaganda."" Since McEntarfer's sudden dismissal, economists across the political spectrum have offered a more worrisome assessment, warning that Trump's actions threaten to pollute the non-partisan work at BLS to measure the trajectory of economy.","Kevin Hassett, the director of the White House National Economic Council, insisted on Sunday that the administration was ""absolutely not"" shooting the messenger.

US President Donald Trump lashed out at radio host Charlamagne Tha God on Sunday, accusing the broadcaster of knowing “nothing” about him or his accomplishments. The backlash came after Charlamagne, whose real name is Lenard McKelvey, offered a critical assessment of Trump's time in office.“I wouldn’t give it a good rating simply because the least of us are still being impacted the worst,” Charlamagne said Thursday on a Fox News show hosted by Lara Trump, the US President’s daughter-in-law and former co-chair of the Republican National Committee.In response, Trump took to Truth Social, calling the radio host a “low IQ individual” who “has no idea what words are coming out of his mouth, and knows nothing about me or what I have done - like just ending 5 Wars, including a 31 year bloodbath between Republic of the Congo and Rwanda, where Seven Million people have died, and there was no end in sight.”The US President at the same time, took a jibe at former president Joe Biden and former vice president Kamala Harris , saying, “STUPID and CORRUPT JOE BIDEN set the record for doing the Worst Job as President, EVER. But this dope, Charlamagne, would vote for Sleepy Joe or Kamala?”Trump also took issue with Charlamagne’s use of God in his professional name, writing, “(Why is he allowed to use the word ""GOD"" when describing himself? Can anyone imagine the uproar there would be if I used that nickname?""Charlamagne acknowledged benefiting from Trump-era tax cuts but said the legislation hurt many Americans.“There’s going to be so many people that’s hurt by that bill. Anything that takes away Medicaid from people and will put people in a worse financial situation than they were previously in, I’m not for,"" he said, as quoted by AP.The radio host also predicted a shift within the Republican Party, claiming that traditional conservatives could use controversy surrounding Trump’s handling of Jeffrey Epstein-related records to challenge his control of the party.“I think there’s a political coup going on right now in the Republican Party that people aren’t paying attention to,” Charlamagne said, as cited by AP. “I think this Epstein thing is going to be a way for traditional conservatives to take their party back. I really do.”He continue, “I think they know this is the issue that has gotten the base riled up... for the first time they can probably take their party back and not piss off the MAGA base. I think they’re going to do that.”Trump has faced renewed criticism from some of his supporters after the Justice Department announced it would not release additional documents related to the Epstein investigation. Trump had previously promised to release the Epstein Files, which many had speculated contained a list of high-profile individuals associated, including Trump himself. Epstein, a convicted sex offender, died in a New York jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges.Charlamagne told Lara Trump that his critiques of political leaders are not limited to one party. “I gave President Biden the same hell” when he believed the Democratic president was falling short, he said.","US President Donald Trump lashed out at radio host Charlamagne Tha God on Sunday, accusing the broadcaster of knowing “nothing” about him or his accomplishments.

Holly, a key victim in the violent Cincinnati street brawl that went viral over the weekend spoke out for the first time after the incident, describing the lasting impact of her injuries and thanking the public for their overwhelming support.The brutal incident occurred early Saturday morning in downtown Cincinnati when a man was chased into the street, thrown to the ground, and beaten by a crowd. As bystanders recorded the attack, one individual body-slammed the man while others kicked and stomped him.In an attempt to help, Holly rushed to the scene—but was punched twice in the face. She fell hard to the pavement, striking her head and bleeding from the mouth as onlookers continued to cheer. Video of the assault quickly spread online, sparking outrage.Appearing in a video update on Sunday with visible facial bruising, Holly described the ordeal as harrowing. “It’s been very, very hard, and I’m still recovering,” she said. “I still have very bad brain trauma.”A single mother, Holly thanked the public for their continued prayers and support. “I just want to say thank you so much to everyone for all of the love and support.It is very humbling… It’s definitely what’s keeping me going, and you have just brought back faith and humanity.”She is one of six people injured in the brawl, and so far, police have arrested four suspects while two more remain at large.Jermaine Matthews, 39, Dominique Kittle, 37, Montianez Merriweather, 34, and Dekyra Vernon, 24, have been charged in connection with the incident. Kittle, Merriweather, and Vernon remain in Hamilton County Jail, while Matthews has been released on bond, reported Fox News.Matthews faces multiple charges including two counts of felonious assault, misdemeanor assault, and aggravated riot. Merriweather and Vernon are also charged with felonious assault, aggravated riot, and assault. Kittle is facing a single count of assault.Ohio gubernatorial candidate Vivek Ramaswamy said on Monday that he spoke with Holly and criticised the lack of police presence during the attack. ""It’s unconscionable that there were no police present in that area of Cincinnati on a Friday night, or even an ambulance to take her to the hospital,” Ramaswamy wrote on X.“Hard-working Americans shouldn’t have to worry for their safety when they have a good time in our cities,"" he added.Vice President JD Vance also condemned the violence, saying he was appalled by footage showing ""a grown man who sucker punched a middle-aged woman.""","Holly, a key victim in the violent Cincinnati street brawl that went viral over the weekend spoke out for the first time after the incident.

‘Trains CCP’s future leaders’: Report accuses Harvard of having decade-long ties to Chinese Communist Party; Congress demands all records by August 7,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trains-ccps-future-leaders-report-accuses-harvard-of-having-decade-long-ties-to-chinese-communist-party-congress-demands-all-records-by-august-7/articleshow/123075549.cms,"Trump’s Big China Fear Over Harvard: Millions In Funds, Communist Influence And More

Trump-Harvard row







Harvard University is facing backlash after a congressional probe revealed years-long partnerships with organisations tied to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).The revelation sparked concerns over foreign influence and national security risks.According to documents obtained by the Washington Free Beacon, the Ivy League institution allegedly collaborated with CCP-controlled entities for over a decade.The foreign bodies included the Central Organisation Department, the powerful organ responsible for training and selecting China’s top officials.A general focus of the investigation is the Harvard Kennedy School’s partnership with the Chinese Executive Leadership Academy Pudong, a government-run training school.Whistleblowers have claimed that Chinese government and party officials were sent to Harvard as part of their official education, prompting bipartisan alarm.“Harvard’s formal partnership with a CCP-controlled school to train their future leaders raises serious concerns about the CCP’s influence in American institutions,” said representative John Moolenaar.“We are committed to uncovering the full extent of these relationships to ensure transparency and protect national interests,"" he added.Furthermore, representatives Tim Walberg and Elise Stefanik co-signed a letter accusing Harvard of working directly with groups formed by CCP ideology, particularly ""Xi Jinping Thought"".The scandal adds to mounting pressure on the university, which is reportedly considering $500 million payout to settle disputes with US President Donald Trump and his administration over alleged campus anti-Semitism and its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies.In April, the Free Beacon also reported that Harvard had trained members of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, a paramilitary group sanctioned by the US for its involvement in the repression of Uyghur Muslims.Congress has given Harvard until August 7 to turn over all records tied to its dealings with CCP-linked bodies, including financial or material exchanges.Harvard University and the Trump administration have been at odds since the MAGA chief assumed office in January.In April 2025, the administration froze approximately $2.2–2.6 billion in federal research funding and revoked Harvard’s certification to host international students, citing alleged failures to tackle antisemitic harassment and ideological bias. In response, Harvard filed lawsuits claiming federal overreach and threats to academic freedom.Earlier this week, reports surfaced that the White House had proposed a settlement of up to $500 million, but Harvard President Alan Garber denied any imminent agreement, calling the figure false and leaked by administration sources. He emphasised that any deal must not compromise the university’s freedom to govern academic affairs independently.The battle has drawn intense scrutiny from faculty, students, alumni, and congressional Democrats.On Friday, fourteen Democratic legislators—many of them Harvard alumni—warned that any settlement under political pressure could prompt a congressional investigation, arguing that yielding to the White House risks setting a dangerous precedent for institutional autonomy across US higher education.Meanwhile, faculty groups have continued to mobilise, demanding red lines on issues such as external monitoring, data-sharing, and control over admissions and hiring.","Harvard University is facing backlash after a congressional probe revealed years-long partnerships with organisations tied to the Chinese Communist Party.

A 5.4-magnitude earthquake struck several parts of Pakistan early Saturday morning, causing panic among residents in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab and the capital Islamabad, as reported by ARY News.The National Seismic Monitoring Centre (NSMC) reported that the earthquake occurred at 2.04 am PST at a depth of 102 kilometers. Its epicentre was located in the Hindukush mountain region in Afghanistan.Tremors were also felt across various regions in Afghanistan and Tajikistan, the NSMC confirmed.In Pakistan, the tremors were reported in multiple districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, including Peshawar, Swat, Malakand, Nowshera, Charsadda, Karak, Dir, Mardan, Mohmand, Shangla, Hangu, Swabi, Haripur, and Abbottabad.Tremors were also felt in several parts of Punjab province including cities such as Lahore, Rawalpindi, Islamabad, Attock, Taxila, Murree, Sialkot, Gujranwala, Gujrat, Sheikhupura, Ferozwala and Muridke.Although the earthquake caused no reported loss of life or property, it led to widespread panic. Many residents rushed out of their homes in fear and began reciting verses from the holy Quran, according to ARY News.Pakistan is one of the most earthquake-prone countries in the world, as it lies at the intersection of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates. This collision zone makes the region highly vulnerable to frequent seismic activities.High-risk areas include Balochistan , Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan, which are located near major fault lines like the Main Central Thrust. Punjab, situated on the northwestern edge of the Indian plate, also remains susceptible. Sindh, though relatively less prone to earthquakes is also not free from risk due to its tectonic positioning.One of the most powerful earthquakes in the country's history was the 1945 Balochistan earthquake that measured 8.1 in magnitude.","A 5.4-magnitude earthquake struck several parts of Pakistan early Saturday morning.

‘Trump Angry As India Denies Nobel Push, Rejects' Mediation In Operation Sindoor Ceasefire | WATCH





In a symbolic assertion of strategic alignment, Pakistan’s military hosted on Friday a grand ceremony at General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi to mark the 98th anniversary of China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA), showcasing its deepening defence partnership with Beijing.The event came soon after a surprise 19% tariff on Pakistani imports announced by US President Donald Trump just days after Washington and Islamabad concluded new trade deals.While the tariff decision is believed to have been discussed between the two sides as part of broader trade negotiations, Trump’s typically blunt commentary on social media appeared aimed more at India than Pakistan. In recent days, Trump has taken jabs at New Delhi over its continued purchase of Russian oil and defence equipment, while casting Pakistan in a more favourable light.At GHQ, however, Pakistan’s military made its strategic loyalties unambiguous. Army Chief Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir hosted Chinese ambassador Jiang Zaidong and PLA defence attaché Maj Gen Wang Zhong at a ceremony that included military tributes, visuals of joint defence hardware, and strong political messaging. Munir described the Pakistan-China relationship as a “beacon of mutual trust and shared destiny” and referred to the PLA and Pakistan Army as “iron brothers”.The messaging was clear: Pakistan is reaffirming its long-standing alignment with China even as it navigates transactional ties with Washington and economic turbulence at home. With IMF conditionalities tightening and Western funding streams growing unpredictable, Islamabad continues to anchor itself in Beijing’s strategic orbit, particularly through projects under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).For China, the event was a diplomatic win. As Beijing faces intensifying rivalry with the US across the Indo-Pacific, its deepening influence over a nuclear-armed ally in South Asia reinforces its foothold in the region. The GHQ ceremony was a visual and political endorsement of China’s role as Islamabad’s primary defence and development partner.With Pakistan and China enhancing defence cooperation and projecting unity, New Delhi faces a more tightly aligned northern bloc just as it expands its own security ties with the US and with Indo-Pacific allies.Despite the potential economic fallout of the US tariffs, Rawalpindi appears undeterred. In an era of fluid alliances, Pakistan is betting on consistency with Beijing over the unpredictability of Western partners, a gamble that could reshape the regional balance in the years ahead.",Pakistan's military hosted a grand ceremony to mark the 98th anniversary of China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) The event came soon after a surprise 19% tariff on Pakistani imports announced by US President Donald Trump.

A Pakistani anti-terrorism court on Thursday sentenced more than 100 members of jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan 's party to prison terms on charges related to riots that targeted military sites in 2023, a court order said.Fifty-eight of the defendants, who included parliamentarians and senior officials, were sentenced to 10 years in prison and the rest were given sentences ranging from one to three years, the court said.The accused include Omar Ayub Khan and Shibli Faraz, the leaders of Khan's opposition Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party (PTI) in the lower and upper houses of parliament respectively, the court order seen by Reuters read.""The prosecution has proved its case against the accused without a shadow of doubt,"" it said in announcing the sentences.Khan, who has been in prison since 2023 facing charges of corruption, land fraud and disclosure of official secrets, is being tried separately on similar charges related to the riot.The government accuses him and other leaders of inciting the May 9, 2023, protests, during which demonstrators attacked military and government buildings, including the army headquarters in Rawalpindi.He denies wrongdoing and says all the cases are politically motivated as part of a military-backed crackdown to dismantle his party. The military denies it.Khan's arrest had prompted the countrywide violent protests.Thursday's ruling does not directly affect the incitement case against him in which prosecution is still presenting witnesses.The PTI party said it will challenge the verdict.The ruling is the third such mass conviction this month; Khan's party says they have included at least 14 of its parliamentarians.They will lose their seats in parliament under Pakistani laws, which will shred Khan's opposition party's strength.Another 77 were acquitted for lack of evidence in the latest verdict, which is linked to an attack on the office of an intelligence agency in eastern city of Faisalabad, the court said.The party plans new protests starting on August 5, the second anniversary of Khan's jailing, to demand his release.","Fifty-eight of the defendants, who included parliamentarians and senior officials, were sentenced to 10 years in prison.

Pakistan's prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday thanked US President Donald Trump for the ""historic"" trade deal between Islamabad and Washington.“I wish to convey my profound thanks to President Trump @realDonaldTrump for his leadership role in finalization of the historic US-Pakistan trade agreement, successfully concluded by our two sides in Washington, last night. This landmark deal will enhance our growing cooperation so as to expand the frontiers of our enduring partnership in days to come,” Sharif said in a post on X.On Wednesday, Trump announced that the United States has reached an agreement with Pakistan to jointly develop the country’s “massive oil reserves.”“We have just concluded a deal with the country of Pakistan, whereby Pakistan and the United States will work together on developing their massive oil reserves,"" the US president said in a post on Truth Social.The development comes amidst a meeting between Pakistan's finance minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, US secretary of commerce Howard Lutnick, and US trade representative ambassador Jamieson Greer, as per the state-run Radio Pakistan.Pakistan has long asserted the presence of significant oil reserves along its coastline, but efforts to tap into them have seen little progress.

ISLAMABAD: At least 293 people have died and over 600 have been injured across Pakistan since late June as glacial lake outbursts, cloudbursts, and relentless monsoon rains triggered catastrophic floods across the country, from the Himalayas to the southern plains.The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has warned of another severe monsoon spell starting July 29, raising fears of fresh flash floods and landslides, especially in northern regions like Swat, Chitral, Gilgit-Baltistan, and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.Torrential rains have wreaked havoc across the country, sweeping away entire families, burying homes under landslides, and cutting off remote valleys. A sudden cloudburst near Babusar Top and Naran stranded scores of tourists, prompting military-led rescue operations by air and road. Washed-away bridges and blocked highways have hampered relief efforts.The NDMA, provincial agencies, and army teams are on the ground, but operations remain slow and patchy, especially in the hard-to-reach northern areas. Helicopter sorties continue, though poor weather and visibility are disrupting missions.Experts blame successive govts for ignoring climate adaptation and disaster preparedness, despite warnings. “The pattern is repeating itself — glacial melts, erratic monsoons, unprepared institutions. It’s a deadly mix,” said a disaster risk analyst in Islamabad.The crisis echoes the devastating 2022 monsoon floods, which killed over 1,700, submerged a third of the country, and displaced over 30 million people, causing $30 billion in economic losses. Yet, activists say climate resilience remains absent from Pakistan’s national priorities.With more glaciers than any non-polar country, Pakistan faces an increasing frequency of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) due to rising temperatures. Add to that deforestation, poor drainage, and unregulated construction, and experts say even routine monsoons now turn deadly.As another deluge looms, govt has advised evacuations from high-risk zones and warned tourists to stay away from northern areas. But for many already stranded, the warnings have come too late.","At least 293 people have died and over 600 have been injured across Pakistan since late June.

Three Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militants were killed in an encounter with Pakistani security forces in Karachi, officials confirmed on Monday.Among those killed was Zafran, who was identified as the mastermind of a November 2024 attack on two Chinese engineers in Pakistan's largest city. He carried a bounty of Rs 20 million.The operation was conducted late Sunday night in the Manghopir area by the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) and intelligence agencies, CTD official Raja Umer Khattab told. The TTP men opened fire when they saw security personnel approaching, triggering a firefight which lasted over an hour.Authorities recovered a suicide jacket, three grenades, a Kalashnikov rifle, two pistols, and a large quantity of ammunition from the site.On November 5 last year, a private security guard opened fire on two Chinese nationals at a textile mill in Karachi, injuring both before fleeing.Pakistan has witnessed a sharp increase in militant attacks—particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan—since the TTP ended its ceasefire with the federal government in late 2022.Founded in 2007, the TTP is an umbrella organisation of various extremist groups seeking to impose a strict version of Islamic law across Pakistan. It has claimed responsibility for numerous high-profile attacks, including the 2008 Marriott Hotel bombing in Islamabad, the 2009 assault on army headquarters, and multiple strikes on security installations.","Three Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militants were killed in an encounter with Pakistani security forces in Karachi.

Pakistan tribal council threatens highway block over girl’s murder,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-tribal-council-threatens-highway-block-over-girls-murder/articleshow/122939897.cms,"



ISLAMABAD: A tribal jirga (council of elders) in Pakistan’s Tank district has threatened to block a stretch of Indus Highway on July 29 after the killing of a nine-year-old girl sparked public outrage. Convened in Tank’s Gul Imam on Saturday, the jirga issued an 11-point charter of demands, warning of a full blockade if authorities fail to respond.Indus Highway (N-55) is a critical national artery that runs along the river, connecting Karachi in Pakistan’s south with Peshawar in the north and cutting through multiple provinces. The planned blockade at Pezu will impact trade routes, passenger transport, and military convoys.The protests gained momentum after a viral video showed residents confronting armed security personnel -- an extraordinary act in this militarised stretch of southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The footage amplified long-standing anger over arbitrary detentions, raids without warrants, and what locals call collective punishment disguised as counterterrorism.“Our decision to block the highway remains. If our demands are accepted, we’ll reconsider.If not, Pezu will be shut down on July 29,” jirga leader Abdul Qayum Kundi said.Police have registered a case in the girl’s death, but authorities have yet to disclose any findings. Locals allege misconduct or negligence by security forces—claims that remain unverified but widely believed within the community.In a bid to defuse tensions, local officials delivered three sheep and (Pak) Rs 2.5 million (around $9,000) to the girl’s family -- an act rooted in tribal custom, meant to symbolise remorse and reconciliation. But jirga members view it as a token gesture. “This is hush money in ceremonial form,” said one elder.The jirga’s demands include the release of detainees not proven to have militant ties, an end to forced house searches, and a halt to arrests of suspects’ relatives. They also call for the return of confiscated weapons and an end to detentions based on vague accusations of mukhbiri (spying).The jirga’s demands echo those of the banned Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement (PTM), which for years challenged Pakistan’s security policies in its tribal belt.","A tribal jirga in Pakistan’s Tank district has threatened to block a stretch of Indus Highway.

‘Reject Pakistani Rule’: BNM Accuses Pakistan of Genocide in Balochistan, Launches Armed Resistance

Poll Do you think that protests and appeals by families of the abducted individuals can lead to change? Yes, they can raise awareness. No, they are largely ineffective.





The crisis of enforced disappearances in Pakistan's Balochistan region and beyond has deepened this week, as a disturbing string of abductions emerges from Karachi, Noshki, and Kech, according to The Balochistan Post (TBP).Among the most alarming cases is that of Muslim Dad Baloch, a fourth-semester philosophy student at the University of Karachi.On Monday evening, he was reportedly abducted near the university's Maskan Gate. Eyewitnesses say he was taken by unidentified men in a vehicle while returning to his hostel with friends.Originally from Mashkay in Awaran district, Muslim Dad was a familiar face within the Baloch student community in Karachi. His sudden disappearance has sparked fear among his peers and left his family devastated.In Noshki, another troubling case unfolded earlier today when Hafeezullah, the son of Peer Mohammad and a resident of Qaziabad, was allegedly picked up from his home by Pakistani security forces. His family has raised alarm over his unknown whereabouts and is demanding his immediate release.TBP also reported two recent disappearances in Kech district.On July 23, 16-year-old shopkeeper Qambar Baloch was allegedly taken by men believed to belong to Military Intelligence and the ISI while he was in Jusak, Turbat. And on June 27, Imran Khan, a 26-year-old student of Balochi language and culture at the University of Turbat, was reportedly abducted by Frontier Corps and Military Intelligence personnel in Turbat city—in broad daylight.“These are not isolated cases. This is a pattern,” said a representative from Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP), a group that has long campaigned for the safe recovery of abducted individuals. Despite repeated appeals and protests, most cases remain unresolved, with no accountability or formal investigations.","Muslim Dad Baloch, a fourth-semester philosophy student at the University of Karachi, was reportedly abducted on Monday.

Pakistan Blames India For Tensions, Credits Trump For Ceasefire Between Nuclear Rivals





Beijing/Islamabad: Pakistan army chief Asim Munir, who is on his first visit to China after his elevation as the field marshal, on Friday held talks with top Chinese leaders and discussed ways to deepen cooperation across all sectors. Munir held separate meetings with V-P Han Zheng, top military official general Zhang Youxia and foreign minister Wang Yi, according to official media reports.This is Munir's first visit to China after India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terrorist infrastructure in Pakistam in response to the Pahalgam terror attack. During the conflict, Pakistan used extensive military equipment supplied by China. This is also Munir's first visit to China after his trip to Washington, where he met US President Trump and sought to establish close ties with America, Beijing's strategic rival.The visit coincides with Pakistan's foreign minister Ishaq Dar making a trip to Washington, where he is expected to meet US secretary of state Marco Rubio.

ISLAMABAD: As jailed former PM Imran Khan completes two years in prison, his sons – Sulaiman and Qasim – have stepped into the political spotlight, launching an aggressive lobbying campaign in the United States to press for their father’s release just days before Khan’s call for a nationwide protest on Aug 5, which has put the state on edge.Khan, arrested on Aug 5, 2023, remains behind bars despite some convictions being overturned. He is currently serving time in three major cases that his party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), claims are part of a broader effort to keep him out of politics.He was convicted in the Toshakhana case, involving the illegal sale of state gifts received during his premiership. He was sentenced in the cipher case, accused of leaking classified diplomatic correspondence for political gain. And in the Al-Qadir Trust case, Khan and his wife were held liable for controversial land deals linked to a charitable trust.PTI has consistently maintained that the charges are politically motivated, aimed at “eliminating the most popular leader” in the country.Now, with most of PTI’s senior leadership jailed, exiled, or forced to resign, Khan’s sons have taken the international route. Based in the UK, the brothers have held meetings in Washington DC with US lawmakers, policy groups and human rights organisations, and are reportedly preparing to testify before congressional panels.Their message: Imran Khan is being held in solitary confinement in inhumane conditions, denied light, medical access, and family contact.The campaign has triggered speculation about whether the two sons might return to Pakistan, possibly to appear at the planned protest. While PTI has not confirmed this, party insiders say their presence could act as a powerful morale boost for the party’s dispersed support base.Meanwhile, the state has moved swiftly to neutralise any protest momentum. On July 22, an anti-terror court in Lahore sentenced eight senior PTI leaders, including Dr Yasmin Rashid, to 10 years in prison for their alleged role in the May 9 riots, when military installations were targeted after Khan’s initial arrest. Observers see the convictions as a tactical strike to undercut mobilisation ahead of the Aug 5 protest. The verdicts have raised concerns among legal experts about the selective use of terrorism laws against political opponents.From prison, Khan has issued a call for unity among PTI ranks, urging supporters to “shun differences” and prepare for what he called a decisive moment for Pakistan’s democracy. But the party remains fractured and leaderless, with ongoing rifts between loyalists and factions seen as open to negotiations with the establishment.At the heart of the political storm is the army chief, Field Marshal Asim Munir, who was controversially elevated to five-star rank in May. PTI blames him, along with PML-N and PPP leaders, for orchestrating what it calls a civil-military clampdown to sideline Khan and crush dissent.In a recent prison note, Khan mocked Munir as the “King of the Jungle”, accusing him of ruling the country through “fear, not law”.","Sulaiman and Qasim Khan have launched an aggressive lobbying campaign in the United States to press for their father’s release.

A newly formed political party led by students who played a key role in the anti-government protests that led to the ouster of former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina held a rally in the country's capital Dhaka on Sunday, pledging to build a new Bangladesh amid ongoing political uncertainty surrounding the next national election, reported news agency AP.The National Citizen Party, formed by the organisers of last year’s protests, gathered near the Shaheed Minar monument with around 1,000 supporters. Party leader Nahid Islam announced a 24-point agenda and called for the creation of a new constitution to replace the one adopted in 1972.“Exactly one year ago, at this Shaheed Minar (memorial), we vowed to free this country from the hands of dictatorship. By responding to that call, we together defeated the fascist rule and regained control of our country,” Islam said.“Let us all unite and transform this historic 24-point agenda into reality to build a new Bangladesh, a Bangladesh that fulfills the dreams of all citizens, as we move toward the formation of our second republic,” he added, as quoted by the agency.The party did not provide specific details on the proposed constitution but said its goal was to reflect the aspirations of a new generation of Bangladeshis.Separately, the student wing of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) also held a large rally in Dhaka.BNP acting chairman Tarique Rahman, who has been in exile in London since 2008, addressed the crowd virtually and urged supporters to mobilise young voters ahead of the upcoming polls, according to AP.Rahman said, “We must reclaim our democratic rights and engage the youth in shaping Bangladesh’s future.”The rallies took place two days before the interim government, led by Nobel peace prize laureate Muhammad Yunus is set to mark the first anniversary of Sheikh Hasina’s departure from power.Hasina fled to India on August 5, 2024, following weeks of mass protests and political unrest that resulted in hundreds of deaths and thousands of injuries. Yunus assumed office on August 8.The demonstrations come amid criticism of the interim government’s handling of law and order, with opposition parties accusing it of failing to contain mob violence and uphold human rights.With Hasina’s Awami League banned and the political future still unclear, the rallies highlighted the growing activity among both new and established political forces ahead of the next election.","National Citizen Party, formed by the organisers of last year’s protests, gathered near the Shaheed Minar monument with around 1,000 supporters.

KATHMANDU: The narrow streets of Kathmandu - sized for pedestrians and rickshaws - are choked with engines. Buses, motorbikes, small trucks and taxis fill the sprawling valley with horns and exhaust. For its more than 3 million residents, just getting around is a dangerous, eye-stinging ordeal.But recently, a new kind of motor has started to ease the crush. Sleek electric vehicles glide by with a quiet hum. Gleaming showrooms do a brisk business in the latest models, and charging stations on highways have turned into rest stops with cafes for drivers. Over the past year, EVs accounted for 76% of all passenger vehicles and half of the light commercial vehicles sold in Nepal. Five years ago, that number was essentially zero. The EV market share in Nepal is now behind only those of a few countries, including Norway, Singapore and Ethiopia. The average for all countries was 20% in 2024.The swift turnover is the result of govt policies aimed at leveraging Nepal's wealth of hydropower, easing dependence on imported fossil fuels and clearing the smog. It has been fed by an intense push from Nepal's biggest neighbour, China, world's dominant manufacturer of battery-powered vehicles.""For us, using EVs is a comparative advantage,"" said Mahesh Bhattarai, DG of Nepal's department of customs. ""In the global market, Chinese EVs are expanding. The same is happening in Nepal."" The effort stands in contrast to policies in the US and Europe, which have blocked Chinese EVs to protect their domestic auto industries. And it carries hope for other developing countries that seek to become wealthier without enduring the crucible of pollution from which many rich nations have already emerged.""We're interested in making sure this rapid growth in these emerging markets doesn't follow the same trajectory as developed markets,"" said the head of sustainable transportation for UN Environment Programme. But as Nepal has learned, there are obstacles. The country has spent heavily on subsidies, and getting rid of the support too quickly could derail the shift to battery power. Even if gas-powered passenger cars are phased out, cleaning the air will require public transportation to go electric as well.Asian Development Bank has been a key financier of Nepal's dams, transmission lines and charging networks. The head of ADB's resident mission in Nepa is cautious about the risk of backsliding. ""Given the economic sense this EV conversion represents, I think I would see it as unlikely that we would have major policy change.""Businesses and advocates are, however, concerned Nepal may already be backing off its commitment to the transition. It has had three PMs in past five years, and priorities have shifted with each of them. Nepal's central bank doubled down-payment requirements for EVs. Govt has been inching up its tariffs on EVs. And auto dealers worry faulty cars from some smaller Chinese brands could discredit the category. Rajan Babu Shrestha holds the licence to distribute cars in Nepal from Tata Motors. He has seen sales skyrocket on his EVs, but he could go back to selling gas-powered vehicles if tariffs rose or subsidies for charging stations went away. ""Stability is always a question mark.""","Electric vehicles account for 76% of all passenger vehicles and half of light commercial vehicles sold in Nepal.

Prince Harry has refuted claims of a physical fight with Prince Andrew during a 2013 family gathering, where he allegedly caused his uncle's nose to bleed.The Daily Mail published excerpts on Saturday from Andrew Lownie's new biography, suggesting a heated argument turned physical after ""Punches were thrown over something Andrew said behind Harry's back"". The alleged fight began when “Harry told [his uncle] he was a coward not to say it to his face. Harry got the better of Andrew by all accounts, leaving him with a bloody nose before the fight was broken up.”Lownie's book, Entitled: The Rise and Fall of the House of York, alleges Andrew made disparaging remarks about Meghan Markle, suggesting their marriage would be brief and calling her an opportunist who was too old for Harry.Andrew allegedly “accused Meghan of being an opportunist and thought she was too old for Harry, adding that his nephew was making the biggest mistake ever,” and told his nephew he had gone “bonkers”, accusing him of not doing “any due diligence into her past” before they got engaged in 2017.A spokesperson for Harry and Meghan issued a statement late Saturday categorically denying both the physical confrontation and Andrew's alleged comments about the Duchess of Sussex.“I can confirm Prince Harry and Prince Andrew have never had a physical fight, nor did Prince Andrew ever make the comments he is alleged to have made about the Duchess of Sussex to Prince Harry.” The couple has sent legal correspondence to the Daily Mail regarding these claims, The Guardian reported.The biography suggests both Harry and William had difficult relationships with Andrew, who lost his royal and military titles in 2021 following controversy over his association with Jeffrey Epstein. The book claims Andrew also made unfavourable comments about Catherine, the Princess of Wales.King Charles continues to allow Andrew residence at the Royal Lodge, despite ending his annual £1m allowance. The biography suggests Prince William desires to remove both Andrew and Sarah Ferguson, who share the residence despite their 1996 divorce.Harry distanced himself from royal duties, citing institutional problems and alleged racism, relocating to North America in 2020. Following his 2022 memoir Spare, he expressed openness to family reconciliation in a BBC interview.","Prince Harry has refuted claims of a physical fight with Prince Andrew during a 2013 family gathering, where he allegedly caused his uncle's nose to bleed.

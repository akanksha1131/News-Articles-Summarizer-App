Luigi Mangione , the 26-year-old arrested for the murder of a UnitedHealthcare executive, was not only battling legal issues but also fighting excruciating physical pain. According to his former landlord, RJ Martin , Mangione’s chronic back problems were so severe that dating or being physically intimate was out of the question.Martin, who owns a “co-living” space in Honolulu, said Mangione confided in him about his condition, revealing he suffered from a pinched nerve and a misaligned spine. “He knew that dating and being physically intimate with his back condition wasn’t possible,” Martin shared with The New York Times. “I remember him telling me that, and my heart just breaks.”Mangione, who spent six months living in Martin’s Surfbeak co-living space , had been dealing with the pain for some time, which he described as affecting his lower vertebrae, causing almost half an inch of misalignment. The discomfort was debilitating, a fact that seemingly shaped his personal life and relationships.Martin, who met Mangione in 2022 when he interviewed for a spot in Surfbeak’s first Honolulu space, described the suspect as an intelligent, accomplished engineer with an upbeat demeanor. “He fit the bill,” Martin said, praising Mangione as an ideal community member aligned with Surfbeak’s mission to ""leave things better than we found them.""Despite his challenges, Mangione seemed to maintain an optimistic outlook. But behind that was a man struggling with his body’s limitations. The back pain, Martin explained, was something Mangione was “constantly trying to deal with.”Mangione’s history of back issues is not just a personal anecdote. According to a former high school classmate, Mangione had lost contact with his family following back surgery. His Goodreads account featured several books related to chronic back pain , hinting at the toll it had taken on his mental and emotional well-being.While the details of Mangione's arrest for the murder of UnitedHealthcare executive Andrew Thompson remain unclear, there have been increasing speculations linking his physical struggles to the crime. A manifesto found with Mangione included accusations against health insurance companies for putting corporate greed ahead of the well-being of their clients, raising questions about whether his chronic pain influenced his alleged actions.","Luigi Mangione, the 26-year-old arrested for the murder of a UnitedHealthcare executive, was battling excruciating physical pain.

The break in the CEO murder case



The lessons learned



At first glance, the assassination of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson seemed like the work of a meticulous mastermind — Luigi Mangione , the suspected killer who moved through the streets of New York City like a ghost, leaving almost no trace. But as authorities pieced together the trail left behind, it became clear: this assassin may have planned his moves with precision but stumbled over key mistakes that ultimately unraveled his escape.Experts are calling it a study in contradictions. ""You see careful planning on one side and careless execution on the other,"" said retired FBI agent Steve Moore, as quoted by CNN. ""It's as if he meticulously planned the perfect crime, but skipped the part about covering his tracks.""Here’s how the killer’s plan unraveled—and how his missteps turned a master plan into a public spectacle.To avoid the scrutiny of airports, the suspect, identified as Luigi Mangione, chose the anonymity of a Greyhound bus. Paying cash and leaving no digital footprint, Mangione arrived in Manhattan on November 24, a full 10 days before the killing. He checked into a hostel using a fake ID and paid for everything in cash, ensuring no credit card trail linked him to the city.""He understood how to disappear in plain sight,"" said former NYPD Deputy Commissioner Richard Esposito. ""But even the best-laid plans have cracks.""Mangione wore a mask in public, avoiding security cameras, but lowered it just once—when a hostel employee flirted with him. That moment of human connection proved to be his undoing. ""That brief smile, that fleeting interaction, gave investigators the clearest image of his face,"" said John Miller, a law enforcement analyst.And it wasn’t his only blunder. The suspect left behind a trail of discarded items—an energy bar wrapper, a Starbucks water bottle, and even a burner phone—providing authorities with DNA evidence and a partial fingerprint. While none matched existing databases, it was enough to keep investigators on his trail.""He thought he was being clever, but leaving behind so much evidence was amateurish,"" said criminologist Casey Jordan. ""He either overestimated his ability to outsmart investigators or underestimated their reach.""The attack itself was executed with eerie precision. Surveillance footage shows Mangione hiding behind a car just minutes before Thompson walked by. At exactly 6:44 am., he approached the CEO from behind and fired a single shot with a “ghost gun”—an untraceable weapon equipped with a silencer.""This wasn’t random,"" said former FBI agent Ken Gray. ""He knew Thompson’s schedule, his route, and how to make a quick exit.""Immediately after the attack, Mangione fled on an electric bike, abandoned it in Central Park, hailed a cab, and boarded an interstate bus. The calculated getaway suggested rehearsals, Gray added, calling the suspect’s escape route “a choreographed performance.”Mangione evaded capture for five days, but his freedom ended not in the shadows, but under the fluorescent lights of a McDonald’s in Altoona, Pennsylvania.A sharp-eyed employee recognized him from widely circulated photos and alerted authorities. When police arrived, they found Mangione armed with another ghost gun and carrying several fake IDs—one of which tied him directly to his New York activities.Law enforcement experts say the case is a stark reminder of how even the most elaborate plans can unravel. ""He planned the perfect crime but failed to think through the aftermath,"" said Moore. ""Every mistake compounded the next, until his arrest became inevitable.""For NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch, the case highlights the power of collaboration between law enforcement and the public. “Tips from ordinary people, amplified by media coverage, brought this fugitive to justice,” she said.","Luigi Mangione is accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.

President Joe Biden expressed regret on Wednesday for not branding pandemic relief checks with his name in 2021, acknowledging that former President Donald Trump's decision to do so in 2020 likely earned him credit for aiding Americans during the crisis. Speaking at the Brookings Institution, Biden reflected on his economic legacy as his term concludes, while challenging President-elect Trump to maintain Democratic policy gains.""I signed the American Rescue Plan , the most significant economic recovery package in our history, and also learned something from Donald Trump,"" Biden said.

A resurfaced video featuring US Representative Nancy Mace engaging in a suggestive act with another woman has sparked controversy, particularly in light of her recent legislative actions targeting transgender individuals' access to bathrooms.The video, reportedly from 2017, shows Mace participating in a drinking game where she and another woman engage in an act known as "" baby birding ."" This practice involves passing a shot of liquor mouth-to-mouth, often seen as intimate or provocative. At the time, the video drew criticism for being inappropriate, and its recent reemergence has reignited discussions about her personal conduct and political stance.Recently, Mace introduced a resolution to restrict access to single-sex facilities in federal spaces, including within the US Capitol, based on individuals' sex assigned at birth. This proposal was widely viewed as targeting a newly elected transgender lawmaker and has fueled national debates about bathroom access and gender identity.Expanding on this, Mace proposed legislation to impose similar restrictions across all federal properties, mandating that individuals use restrooms corresponding to their biological sex. Exceptions were included for emergency responders and law enforcement. The legislation has drawn both support and criticism, with arguments centering on privacy, safety, and inclusivity.The resurfaced video has led to accusations of hypocrisy, with critics pointing to the contrast between Mace's participation in the provocative act and her vocal stance against transgender individuals accessing facilities that align with their gender identity. Many argue that the video undermines her credibility as a defender of privacy and women’s spaces.Mace’s supporters, however, contend that the video is irrelevant to her legislative agenda.

Critics have questioned whether Mace’s actions in the video align with the values she champions through her legislative efforts. Meanwhile, her supporters argue that the incident is being used to unfairly discredit her.

What is the Luigi Mangione '286 Conspiracy Theory'?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-is-the-luigi-mangione-286-conspiracy-theory/articleshow/116176938.cms,"The Case: The Murder of Brian Thompson



Details of the Crime



Mangione’s Arrest



Key Connections to the Number 286







Timeline of Events



The ""286 conspiracy theory"" centers on the alleged connections between Luigi Mangione—a suspect in the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson—and the number 286. Internet sleuths have identified several supposed links between this number and various aspects of Mangione’s life, actions, and the murder, fueling speculation about deeper meanings or intentions.On December 7, 2024, Brian Thompson, CEO of UnitedHealthcare, was fatally shot outside a Hilton hotel in Midtown Manhattan. Surveillance footage captured a masked gunman fleeing the scene, described by witnesses as wearing dark clothing and carrying a concealed weapon. The attack occurred at approximately 9:15 PM as Thompson exited a private dinner event. The gunman fired multiple shots, striking Thompson in the chest and abdomen. Despite immediate emergency response, Thompson was pronounced dead upon arrival at a nearby hospital.Thompson was a significant figure in the corporate healthcare industry, known for leading cost-cutting measures and streamlining insurance policies. While these efforts were celebrated by some in the corporate world, they also attracted criticism from activists and patients who felt neglected by the healthcare system.The weapon used in the murder was a ghost gun, an untraceable firearm assembled from unregulated parts. This type of weapon, favored by those seeking to avoid detection, was later discovered among Mangione’s possessions. Witness accounts and surveillance footage showed the suspect fleeing north on foot in a calculated manner, leading authorities to believe the crime was premeditated. Investigators connected Mangione to the murder using ballistic evidence, digital footprints, and his documented animosity toward the corporate healthcare sector.Two days after the murder, on December 9, 2024, Mangione was arrested at a McDonald’s in Altoona, Pennsylvania. He was found in possession of a ghost gun similar to the one used in the murder, a three-page handwritten manifesto detailing his grievances against corporate America, and forged identification documents. Investigators determined that Mangione had fled Manhattan immediately after the crime, using cash and burner phones to evade capture.The number 286 has emerged as a recurring element in the investigation, with internet sleuths drawing various connections. One notable link is the Pokémon Breloom, which holds the Pokédex number 286. This Pokémon featured prominently in Mangione’s X (formerly Twitter) account banner, leading some to speculate that it was chosen intentionally.Some have tied the number to Proverbs 28:6, a Bible verse stating, “Better is a poor man who walks in his integrity than a rich man who is crooked in his ways.” This verse has been interpreted as reflective of Mangione’s disdain for corporate greed and figures like Thompson. Furthermore, in healthcare billing, denial code 286 refers to claims denied due to failure to meet appeal deadlines—a symbolic connection given Mangione’s documented criticism of the healthcare system.On December 7, 2024, Brian Thompson was fatally shot outside the Hilton hotel in Manhattan. Surveillance footage captured the gunman fleeing the scene. The following day, police identified Mangione as a person of interest based on digital evidence and previous anti-corporate statements. On December 9, Mangione was arrested in Altoona, Pennsylvania, where he was charged with weapons possession and forgery. Authorities began preparing murder charges based on ballistic evidence and Mangione’s manifesto. On December 10, Mangione appeared in court, and prosecutors revealed his potential motivations and ties to the healthcare industry.The Luigi Mangione ""286 conspiracy theory"" hinges on the idea that a single number ties together various elements of a murder case, reflecting either deliberate symbolism or an unusual string of coincidences. While the significance of 286 remains speculative, the case has captivated public interest, demonstrating how patterns—real or imagined—can influence the narratives of high-profile investigations.","The ""286 conspiracy theory"" centers on the alleged connections between Luigi Mangione and the number 286.

'India sending death squads': Trump pick Harmeet K Dhillon's controversial takes on Nijjar killing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/harmeet-dhillon-trump-khalistan/articleshow/116172406.cms,"Ardas

Social Media Remarks Spark Debate

On the Same Page As Trump?

President-elect Donald Trump has added another Indian-American to his team, but his selection of Harmeet K Dhillon as Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights might raise some eyebrows in New Delhi due to her previous statements regarding key figures linked to the separatist Khalistani movement including individuals who have been designate as terrorists by India.Announcing the nomination on Truth Social, Trump commended Dhillon for her work defending civil liberties, including challenging big tech, advocating for religious freedom, and opposing corporate discrimination. A prominent Republican who was born in Chandigarh, Dhillon previously faced backlash from pro-MAGA Christians for reciting the Sikh prayerat the Republican National Convention. Following her nomination, several of her older posts on X (formerly Twitter) have resurfaced, drawing attention to her apparent support for Khalistani extremists. Notably, she has made unverified claims accusing India of operating ""death squads"" and suggesting that the Indian diaspora “participated” in assassinating critics.Dhillon’s posts on X have been highlighted as evidence of pro-Khalistani views, particularly her comments on the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar , a designated terrorist by India, in Canada earlier this year.“Canada’s conservative leader joins other Canadian officials in condemning the extrajudicial murder of Sikh leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar. Good to see them unite against this shocking act,” Dhillon posted, welcoming criticism of Nijjar’s death.She has also alleged that India uses ""death squads"" to target Sikh diaspora members, accusing the Indian government of orchestrating these actions. In one post, she claimed: “India’s death squads targeting diaspora Sikhs, documented in a high-level memo….”Dhillon even accused Indian officials of suppressing dissent abroad: “That India sent death squads to the US and Canada to target vocal Sikh diaspora critics has now been specifically confirmed by US intelligence,” she alleged in another post, citing unverified reports. In another post, Dhillon criticized the Indian diaspora, claiming it played a role in “assassinating India’s critics.”Dhillon’s remarks starkly contrast Trump’s broader narrative and could alienate sections of the Indian-American community , many of whom shifted their support during this election. Before the election, Trump had made significant overtures to Indian-Americans, particularly Hindu Americans. On Diwali, Trump’s statements condemned violence against Hindus in Bangladesh, opposed California’s caste discrimination bill, and emphasized strengthening ties with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.While 60% of Indian-American voters backed Kamala Harris, 31-32% supported Trump—a notable increase in Republican support. The proportion of Indian-Americans identifying as Democrats decreased from 56% in 2020 to 47% in 2024, with a corresponding rise in independents. Republican identification remained stable. A significant gender gap emerged, with 67% of Indian-American women supporting Harris compared to 53% of men. Conversely, 22% of women and 39% of men voted for Trump. Among younger voters, the divide was even sharper, with men under 40 nearly evenly split between the two candidates.It will be interesting to see how the community, which has so far celebrated the elevation of other prominent Indian-Americans under Trump—such as Kash Patel (head of the FBI) Vivek Ramaswamy (co-lead of the Department of Government Efficiency), and Dr Jay Bhattacharya (Surgeon General)—reacts to Dhillon’s appointment.","Harmeet K Dhillon has been nominated as Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights.

Where is Kimberly Guilfoyle?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/did-donald-trump-jr-send-this-birthday-message-to-bettina-anderson-where-is-kimberly-guilfoyle/articleshow/116183020.cms,"Bettina Anderson was seen with Don Jr on her birthday. She shared this surprise birthday message on Instagram.

Bettina Anderson shared this cryptic birthday wish that she probably received from Don Jr.

The rumor mills that Donald Trump Jr was seeing Palm Beach socialite Bettina Anderson dumping his fiancee Kimberly Guilfoyle are again working overtime after Bettina was seen hand in hand with Donald Trump Jr on her birthday Monday. More than their joint appearance, what intrigued people was Bettina Anderson's Instagram story where she posted a birthday message which probably came from Donald Trump Jr.""Many have said you're aging out but I think you're perfect...Happy birthday!"" the message said. ""Tough but fair,"" Bettina wrote. On the left corner of the message, the Instagram account of Donald Trump Jr was tagged in an almost illegible form.DailyMail snapped Don Jr and Anderson together at a cafe in West Palm Beach where they were celebrating Anderson's birthday. The report said Don Jr spends most of his time now at Anderson's townhome in West Palm Beach and not at the Florida mansion that he and Kimberly Guilfoyle bought together after their engagement in December 2020.Just before the election, Florida socialite Bettina Anderson was in the news as the new love interest of Donald Trump Jr. Speculations were rife that Don Jr would break off his engagement with Guilfoyle for Anderson. But both of them co-existed and even after Don Jr spending much of his time with Bettina, he and Kimberly Guilfoyle are also seen together.Like Don Jr, Guilfoyle played a crucial role in Donald Trump's campaign this time and both of them are still working for the same. Guilfoyle, for example, wrote an opinion piece in the Washington Post on Trump's FBI chief pick Kash Patel: 'Patel is highly qualified to lead the FBI'.""Without Mr. Patel, we never would have unraveled the Russia hoax, or learned the dirty details about the Clinton-funded Steele dossier or just how flawed the Federal Intelligence Surveillance Court system is. We are in this moment — and have this opportunity — to restore the integrity of our justice system because of Mr. Patel’s fearless work. And for the record, he is more than qualified,"" ā",Bettina Anderson was seen hand in hand with Donald Trump Jr on her birthday.

From Beyonce to Oprah: How much Kamala Harris' campaign spent on celebrity endorsement,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/from-beyonce-to-oprah-how-much-kamala-harris-campaign-spent-on-celebrity-endorsement/articleshow/116193194.cms,"Kamala Harris and Oprah Winfrey

Vice president Kamala Harris' presidential campaign finances have come under radar following reports that her campaign made substantial payments to Beyoncé's production company, Parkwood Production Media LLC , according to records from the US Federal Election Commission accessed by USA Today.The USA Today report highlighted a $165,000 payment to Parkwood Production Media LLC on November 19, a month after Harris and Beyoncé appeared together at an event in the singer’s hometown of Houston. The company, better known publicly as Parkwood Entertainment, is Beyoncé's management, production, and record label, founded in 2008.Additionally, Harris' campaign paid $1 million to Harpo Productions, Oprah Winfrey's company, in October. Federal records show two payments of $500,000 each on October 15. Winfrey addressed the matter in an Instagram video, stating, “I did not take any personal fee. However, the people who worked on that production needed to be paid. And were. End of story.”The vice president's campaign earlier had denied providing a fee for celebrity endorsements. ""We do not pay. We have never paid any artist and performer,"" Adrienne Elrod , who held the position of senior adviser and senior spokesperson was quoted as saying to New York Post.These substantial expenditures by Harris' campaign have sparked significant criticism and raised questions about the value and effectiveness of high-profile endorsements and events, as noted by USA Today. Despite her campaign’s considerable fundraising success, Kamala Harris ultimately lost the U.S. presidential election to Republican candidate Donald Trump. The loss marked a notable defeat, especially for a candidate with such a significant financial advantage.The report said between October 25 and November 25, the Harris campaign raised $160 million and spent $277 million. In comparison, the Trump campaign raised $87 million and spent $113 million during the same period. Both campaigns allocated the largest portion of their expenditures to media purchases, including television, online ads, and ad production, aiming to maximize voter outreach in the final days of the election. However, federal filings from the Democratic nominee’s campaign reveal a range of additional expenses, which are likely to spark post-election analysis of how Harris' campaign spent over $1 billion but still lost to Trump.","Kamala Harris' presidential campaign finances have come under radar following reports that her campaign made substantial payments to Beyoncé's production company.

Environmental concerns

take center stage

Push for permitting reform

“Drill, baby, drill”

In a bold move to attract major investments, President-elect Donald Trump has pledged expedited federal permits for construction and energy projects exceeding $1 billion.Announcing the plan on his Truth Social account on Wednesday, Trump wrote, “Anyone making a $1 billion investment in the United States will receive fully expedited approvals and permits, including, but in no way limited to, all Environmental approvals.” He ended his post with the emphatic call: “GET READY TO ROCK!!!”The announcement, while stirring enthusiasm among some energy stakeholders, sparked immediate backlash from environmental advocates. Critics argue the plan violates the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), which requires thorough environmental reviews of major projects.Lena Moffitt, executive director of Evergreen Action, called the proposal “blatantly illegal” and accused Trump of prioritizing corporate polluters. “This is another example of Trump selling out America to the highest bidder,” she said. Alexandra Adams from the Natural Resources Defense Council added, “What if someone wants to build a waste incinerator next to Mar-a-Lago or a coal mine next to Bedminster? Community impacts matter.”Despite the controversy, Trump’s push underscores bipartisan interest in overhauling permitting processes. Energy analyst Kevin Book noted that permitting delays often hinder billion-dollar projects across sectors. “The substance here is real. Trump is serious about permitting reform,” Book said.A bipartisan proposal led by Senators Joe Manchin and John Barrasso aims to streamline approvals for energy and mineral projects, but its future remains uncertain. Critics like Rep. Raul Grijalva argue the plan prioritizes oil and gas companies while undermining environmental protections.Jason Miller, a senior Trump adviser, hinted at sweeping deregulation under Trump’s leadership, dubbing his second term a potential “golden age of regulation-cutting.” “He’s ready to move heaven and earth to bring money into the US,” Miller said at a Wall Street Journal conference.While the plan energizes Trump’s base, its legal hurdles and political implications set the stage for fierce debates in 2025. Environmental groups, lawmakers, and industry leaders are bracing for the next chapter of America’s energy policy.","President-elect Donald Trump has pledged expedited federal permits for construction and energy projects exceeding $1 billion.

From space station to real-life suspicion

Digital footprints and a descent into darkness

Luigi Mangione , a 26-year-old former Ivy League student, has been arrested and charged with the murder of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson . The shocking case has taken an unexpected turn, as Mangione’s past as a participant in an online gaming group has drawn eerie parallels to the crime.Mangione, who once played the popular assassin video game 'Among Us' with fellow students at the University of Pennsylvania, was apprehended Monday morning at a McDonald’s in Altoona, Pennsylvania. A vigilant employee recognized him and alerted authorities. Mangione was carrying a 3D-printed firearm , a fake ID, a passport, and a handwritten manifesto that police say reveals his motivation.He faces multiple charges in both Pennsylvania and New York, including murder, possession of a weapon, and forgery.Among Us, a wildly popular multiplayer game, involves players assuming the roles of “crewmates” or a secret “killer” aboard a spaceship. The goal? The killer must eliminate crewmates without being caught, while others attempt to unmask the culprit.Alejandro Romero, a college friend of Mangione and fellow gamer, expressed disbelief at the news. “I just found it extremely ironic that, you know, we were in this game and there could actually be a true killer among us,” Romero told NBC News.Romero described Mangione as a “typical frat guy” who didn’t stand out during their college years but admitted that questions about Mangione’s online behavior post-2020 are now haunting their friend group.The game, widely beloved for its colorful, cartoonish characters and whodunit mechanics, surged in popularity during the pandemic. But the real-life parallel between the game’s premise and Mangione’s alleged crime has cast a dark shadow over the memories of those who once gamed with him.Romero described Mangione as a typical college student, blending in with his peers. ""He just fit a mold,"" Romero said. ""He seemed like any other normal frat dude."" However, in the years following college, Mangione’s online activity began to raise questions.After graduating during the chaos of the pandemic, Mangione’s life seemed to veer off course.A review of his digital footprint revealed that he had reviewed Ted Kaczynski’s Industrial Society and Its Future, better known as the “Unabomber Manifesto,” and became increasingly active on X (formerly Twitter) in 2021 after a five-year hiatus. The shift in his online persona has left Romero and others from their friend group struggling to piece together how this ""normal"" college student could now face such grave accusations.In a statement on X, Mangione's family expressed shock and devastation, offering prayers for Thompson's family and asking for privacy during this time.New York Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch confirmed that Mangione’s 3D-printed firearm and manifesto are under investigation as authorities work to understand his motives.For those who knew him, the arrest has upended their perception of a man they once considered unremarkable. “I didn’t speak to anyone today who wasn’t already aware of what had happened,” Romero said. ""It feels surreal.""","Luigi Mangione, 26, has been arrested and charged with the murder of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson.

(AP)

US President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday selected Federal Trade Commissioner Andrew Ferguson to lead the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), signaling a potential shift in the agency's priorities toward addressing perceived censorship of conservative viewpoints online.Ferguson has emphasized the need for strict antitrust enforcement against social media platforms and advertisers collaborating to suppress viewpoints. “We must vigorously enforce the antitrust laws against any platforms found to be unlawfully limiting Americans' ability to exchange ideas freely and openly,” Ferguson said recently.The appointment follows a contentious period under outgoing FTC Chair Lina Khan , who prioritized aggressive antitrust enforcement, particularly against Big Tech . While some Republicans, including incoming Vice President JD Vance, supported Khan's approach, critics argued it overstepped the agency's authority.Ferguson will inherit several ongoing cases, including antitrust lawsuits against Amazon, Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook), and Microsoft. Key cases include Amazon’s alleged efforts to dominate online marketplaces and Meta’s acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp, which the FTC aims to unwind. However, a judge has expressed skepticism about the FTC's chances of success in the Meta case, set for trial in April.The FTC's future direction under Ferguson remains uncertain, particularly with probes into Microsoft’s cloud services and OpenAI’s privacy practices still pending. Observers expect his tenure to bring significant shifts, especially in enforcing antitrust laws to address ideological censorship concerns.","US President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday selected Federal Trade Commissioner Andrew Ferguson to lead the Federal Trade Commission.

Luigi Mangione , the online version of him, was an Ivy League tech enthusiast who flaunted his tanned, chiseled looks in beach photos and party pictures with blue-blazered frat buddies. He was the valedictorian of a prestigious Baltimore prep school who earned bachelor's and master's degrees at University of Pennsylvania and served as a head counsellor at a pre-college programme at Stanford University.With his credentials and connections, he could have ended up one day as an entrepreneur or the CEO of one of his family's thriving businesses.Police believe Mangione, 26, is the masked shooter who assassinated UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Mangione was arrested in Altoona, Pennsylvania, Monday after an employee at a McDonald's recognised him and called police. Officers said they found him with fake ID, a weapon similar to the one seen in video of the killing and a 262-word manifesto decrying the healthcare industry. The handwritten manifesto begins by appearing to take responsibility for the killing, according to a senior law enforcement official. It notes that as UnitedHealthcare's market capitalisation has grown, American life expectancy has not.""To save you a lengthy investigation, I state plainly I wasn't working with anyone,"" it says. At one point, it says, ""These parasites had it coming"", as well as ""I do apologise for any strife and trauma, but it had to be done."" An internal police report, obtained by NYT, said Mangione ""likely views himself as a hero of sorts who has finally decided to act upon such injustices,"" and expressed concern that others might see him as a ""martyr and an example to follow.""Mangione was charged Monday in Manhattan with murder, along with additional counts of forgery and illegal weapons possession. At his arraignment, a judge asked him if he was in contact with his family. ""Until recently,"" he said.Mangione was in contact with friends and family until six months ago when he suddenly and inexplicably stopped communicating with them. He had been suffering from a painful back injury, friends said, and then went dark, prompting anxious inquiries from relatives. Those six months will most likely be a focus for investigators as they try to piece together what connection Mangione may have to the killing - and what he was doing in the time no one could find him.Mangone left behind a long series of postings about self-improvement, healthy eating and technology - and a review of the Unabomber's manifesto.Mangione came from a privileged upbringing, part of an influential real estate family in Baltimore. ""Our family is shocked and devastated by Luigi's arrest,"" the family said. They said they could not comment further as they ""only know what we have read in the media,"" and they offered their prayers to Thompson's family.Mangione attended high school at the Gilman School, where he wrestled and played sports and was the valedictorian of his class in 2016. In a graduation speech, he described his class as ""coming up with new ideas and challenging the world around it."" After college, Mangione worked for, or had internships with, several tech companies. His LinkedIn profile said he worked as a software engineer at TrueCar. The company said he had not been an employee since 2023. In recent years, Mangione lived for six months in Honolulu in a ""co-living"" space called Surfbreak that caters to remote workers.In Jan, Mangione left a review of a book containing the rambling manifesto of Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber, on Goodreads. ""It's easy to quickly and thoughtless write this off as the manifesto of a lunatic, in order to avoid facing some of the uncomfortable problems it identifies,"" he wrote. ""But it's simply impossible to ignore how prescient many of his predictions about modern society turned out."" One of his favourite quotes, listed on Goodreads, was ""It is no measure of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick society,"" from philosopher Jiddu Krishnamurti.","Luigi Mangione, 26, was the valedictorian of a prestigious Baltimore prep school.

The arrest of Luigi Mangione , a 26-year-old Ivy League graduate accused of fatally shooting UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson , has left his family and friends reeling.Mangione, who was apprehended on Monday at a McDonald’s in Pennsylvania, is facing charges of second-degree murder and multiple weapon offences. The incident, which occurred outside a Midtown Manhattan hotel last Friday, has drawn widespread shock and confusion among those who knew him.“Our family is shocked and devastated by Luigi’s arrest,” Mangione’s family said in a statement, reported ABC News. “We offer our prayers to the family of Brian Thompson and ask people to pray for all involved”, the statement added.Luigi Mangione’s classmates and former associates have described him as a brilliant and approachable individual, making the allegations against him all the more surprising.Freddie Leatherbury, a former classmate from the Gilman School, remembered him as humble despite being named valedictorian in 2016. “He wasn’t snobby, he was unassuming and easy to approach,”Leatherbury.RJ Martin, who lived with Mangione in a communal space in Hawaii, said the news was incomprehensible. “I can make zero sense of it,” Martin told. He recalled Mangione as an active and thoughtful person, participating in activities like book clubs and hiking.Others who worked with Mangione during his academic years shared similar sentiments. A former colleague from a Stanford summer programme described him as socially adept and outgoing. “I never got the impression he would self-destruct,” the colleague toldAmong the reactions to Luigi Mangione's arrest was a deeply emotional tribute from his friend Tracy Le, shared on Instagram just hours after his name was revealed in connection with the case.“When I first saw the news, I was hoping it was just either a common name or a mistake,” Le wrote, highlighting the disbelief she felt.As per the Sun, she described Mangione as one of her ""best, closest, and most trusted friends,"" recalling their close bond.Le shared that Mangione had been a significant presence in her life, the go-to person for her “identity crisis rants, relationship problems, career complaints,” always offering comfort and leaving her feeling better. “He was caring, and smart, and mature, and sweet, and so considerate,” she noted.Reflecting on their time together, Le recalled how she had always relied on him to plan trips and trusted his ability to make their time memorable. “I am shaken, I am blindsided, but most of all, I am sad. I am heartbroken. I am overwhelmed,” she concluded in her tributeAlthough Mangione was known for his social media activity, his sudden silence in recent months raised concerns among friends.On Goodreads, where he had shared reviews of hundreds of books, including a positive review of the Unabomber manifesto, his absence was noticed.Earlier this year, a user on X expressed concern, writing, “Nobody has heard from you in months, and apparently your family is looking for you.”When Mangione was arrested, police found a backpack containing a 3D-printed pistol , silencer, and a note criticising corporate America. Investigators believe the attack was premeditated and targeted.The Mangione family, known for their community involvement, expressed their grief and called for prayers during this difficult time. Meanwhile, friends are left grappling with the stark contrast between the person they knew and the allegations now facing him.","Luigi Mangione, 26, is accused of fatally shooting UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.

As the suspected killer of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was brought for the extradition hearing, Luigi Mangione shouted at the media waiting outside the courtroom. ""It's extremely out of touch and an insult to the intelligence of the American people and the lived experience,"" he said as he was led into a Pennsylvania courthouse. Dressed in an orange prison jumpsuit, Luigi was seen screaming to send out his message. He will have to be transferred to New York City where he coldbloodedly shot Thompson dead.The 26-year-old comes from a wealthy family with political connections as well. But Mangione left the luxury of his family house and started staying in a co-living space in Hawaii. While his former friends, and roommates can't imagine him emerging as a killer as Mangione is a very well-read, well-educated person, his back injury, they said, changed him as a person. It's not clear whether his spinal surgery had anything to do with UnitedHealthcare, but his social media history shows he read a lot about back pain.In a hand-written note found on him during the time of arrest, Mangione compared UnitedHealthcare to a magia accusing the country's largest private insurer of putting its profits above the care of its clients. He wrote that US has the ""most expensive healthcare system in the world"" but ranks 42 in life expectancy"". The note showed how he considered himself as a hero who had to take the action to stop such kind of injustices. “Evidently I am the first to face it with such brutal honesty,” Mangione wrote. Brian Thompson's murder was a ""symbolic takedown"" and a ""direct challenge"" to the health care company's coruup[tion and power games, his note revealed.In the new arrest warrant, five charges were imposed against Mangione -- three counts of criminal possession of a weapon and criminal possession of a forged instrument.","Luigi Mangione, 26, is accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's former Inter-Services Intelligence chief, Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd), has been formally indicted on a number of charges, including engaging in political activities and violating a law on official secrets, during field general court martial (FGCM) proceedings against him, military's media affairs wing said Tuesday.Army's media arm ISPR said FGCM also charged Hameed with compromising state security and interests, abusing authority and resources and causing undue harm to individuals. ISPR said proceedings against Hameed were initiated on Aug 12 under provisions of Pakistan Army Act.Hameed, who served as ISI director-general from June 2019 to Oct 2021, was taken into custody from Rawalpindi four months ago when he was summoned to a meeting by a senior military officer. He was arrested over accusations about his involvement in land grabbing and snatching valuables and property from the owner of a private housing society. His arrest busted the myth that ISI chiefs were untouchable in a country where powerful generals have long wielded unparalleled influence in state affairs.""During the process, involvement of Lt Gen Faiz Hamid (Retd) in events related to creating agitation and unrest, leading up to multiple incidents including but not limited to the May 9, 2023 incident for fomenting instability, at the behest of and in collusion with vested political interests, is also being separately investigated,"" ISPR said. The May 9 incident referred to countrywide protests when PTI supporters stormed army installations and govt buildings following the arrest of party chief and ex-PM Imran Khan for alleged graft. To many, Hameed's close association with Khan was the reason behind his arrest. Khan wanted to continue with Hameed as ISI head but then army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa had been adamant on replacing him. Bajwa eventually succeeded and Khan could serve only a few months in office; he was later removed through a no-confidence.Independent observers say action against Hameed could put Khan under pressure and pave the way for the ex-PM to face a military court on charges of treason and attempting to incite mutiny in the military.","Pakistan's former Inter-Services Intelligence chief, Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd), has been formally indicted on a number of charges.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has been ranked among the lowest globally for slow mobile and broadband internet speeds in the world in Oct, revealed data shared by Ookla’s Speedtest Global Index on Monday.Since Mid-July, internet users in Pakistan have reported frequent slowdowns and persistent connectivity challenges in the country, causing widespread disruptions to browsing and media sharing.The global index placed Pakistan at 100 out of 111 countries in mobile internet speeds, and 141 out of 158 countries in broadband speeds.The country’s regular internet interruptions were accompanied by reports of restricted access to virtual private networks (VPNs), which many Pakistanis use to access X and other restricted websites.According to the World Population Review, which analysed data from Ookla’s Speedtest Global Index and Cable, Pakistan’s average download speed was 7.85 MBPS, with a median mobile download speed of 19.59 MBPS and a median broadband download speed of 15.52 MBPS.Internet service providers and the business community blamed the slump in services on the govt’s installation of a Chinese-built national internet firewall, a combination of hardware and software used by authorities to control and monitor internet traffic, acting as a digital gatekeeper that decides what data to allow or block.The national firewall, also being installed on servers of major internet providers, has the capability to detect and slow digital communication between individual users.Last month, Pakistan home ministry had sought a ban on unregulated use of VPNs, citing their use by terrorists to “facilitate violent activities” and to “access pornographic and blasphemous content”.“VPNs are increasingly being exploited by terrorists to facilitate violent activities and financial transactions in Pakistan,” the ministry said in a letter to the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA).","Pakistan has been ranked among the lowest globally for slow mobile and broadband internet speeds in the world.

Many of them have been sent to prisons in Jammu, Punjab and Rajasthan.The officials said security agencies suspect these individuals are Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) couriers tasked with relaying important communication to the jailed terrorists wherever possible.Interrogation of these individuals typically shows that they have been trained in resistance techniques to withstand questioning by security personnel.The behaviour displayed by those apprehended has raised suspicions among officials, who suggest that their superficial details and evasive responses indicate a potentially larger agenda behind their infiltration, possibly stemming from the fear of repercussions from their handlers.They explained that the use of mobile phones and the internet leaves behind electronic footprints that could expose the plans of both state and non-state actors operating across the border. As a result, the ISI has adopted this new modus operandi.The infiltration strategy reportedly includes women and minors, who may also serve as couriers. In a notable incident in July, a minor from Pakistan's Attock was intercepted in Punjab.During searches, security personnel discovered a damp paper containing Arabic writing though it was not legible, the officials said.The ISI's infiltration tactics have been linked to drug smuggling operations. In one case from Bijnour village in Rajasthan, a Pakistani national posing as mentally disturbed finally spilled the beans during intense questioning that he had been hired by two drug lords in Pakistan -- Sarfaraz Johiya and Nawaz -- to facilitate narcotics trafficking into India and gather information on the deployment of Border Security Force (BSF) troops.In another recent incident, a Pakistani youth named Mohammed Asad from Lahore drove to the zero line on his motorcycle and seemingly awaited arrest by the BSF. During interrogation, he claimed to have had a family dispute over his girlfriend.The officials noted that Asad, who was subsequently moved to prison, may have been acting as a courier. Security agencies have requested additional custody for extended interrogation.In October, a 31-year-old man who identified himself as Shahid Imran entered India through the Jammu sector, claiming that he wanted to visit a Kali temple to get married.The officials explained that such infiltrators are generally booked under the Foreigners Act and Passports Act, for which the punishment ranges from two years to eight years in prison and following this, they are deported.They said that in the late-1990s and early-2000s, ISI exploited the Samjhauta Express, the rail link between India and Pakistan, for covert courier operations, employing individuals known as ""sawari operators"".This service continued until February 2019, when the train service was halted.The ""sawari operators"" played a crucial role in smuggling drugs and transporting funds intended to finance terrorist activities in Jammu and Kashmir, as well as Punjab.However, following a significant crackdown by authorities, these operations were effectively curtailed, leading to the arrest and imprisonment of numerous individuals involved in such activities.Recent developments suggest that the ISI's current method of sending couriers mirrors these past tactics.The officials said that the infiltration strategies being employed now are reminiscent of the past, as the agency seeks new ways to bypass law enforcement and deliver crucial communication and resources across the border.","Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI has reportedly resorted to infiltrating individuals under the influence of drugs or posing as mentally disturbed into India.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan ’s imprisoned ex-prime minister Imran Khan has threatened to launch a nationwide civil disobedience movement, in an apparent bid to keep his public mobilisation campaign intact and to force the country’s powerful authorities to agree to his demands.Less than two weeks after his “final call” protest in Islamabad was violently suppressed, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chief has asked his supporters to converge on Dec 13 in the northwestern city of Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, to pay homage to party workers who were killed in the crackdown by security forces in Islamabad.His call for protest in Islamabad had mobilised thousands of supporters, primarily from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, a province governed by his party. Imran’s party is believed to have organised the Dec 13 gathering in Peshawar keeping in mind his popularity in the region.Imran has also constituted a five-member team to discuss two key demands with govt: release of undertrial prisoners and a judicial probe into the crackdown on the Nov 26 protest march and the violence on May 9 last year. On both dates, PTI workers and Imran’s supporters held major protests, but faced a backlash from govt and security forces.“If these two demands are not accepted, a civil disobedience movement will begin on Dec 14. Govt will bear full responsibility for the consequences,” the PTI chief’s post in Urdu read.“As part of the movement, we will urge overseas Pakistanis to limit remittances and start a boycott campaign. In the second phase, we will escalate our actions further,” he added.The announcement followed Imran’s recent indictment for his involvement in an attack on military headquarters on May 9 last year, while he was also slapped with charges of terrorism for his role in protests that besieged Islamabad last month.Meanwhile, data submitted before the Islamabad high court revealed that the 72-year old cricketer-turned-politician is currently facing 188 criminal cases and inquiries.

At least six Pakistani security personnel were killed and seven wounded on Saturday in an exchange of fire with militants in the Kurram district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.Armed men killed six Pakistani security personnel and wounded seven in a checkpoint attack in the country’s northwest, a police official told news agency AP.The incident occurred in the same region where sectarian clashes have killed at least 130 people during the past few weeks.A ceasefire between the area’s Sunni and Shiite communities is holding and Saturday's incident is not connected to the recent clashes, according to AP.Local official Saleem Khan said armed men attacked a Frontier Corps checkpoint in Bagam, 200 kilometres (125 miles) south of Peshawar city.

Growing threat from Baloch separatists

Sectarian violence fuels instability

Border tensions and counterterrorism efforts

What lies ahead

Pakistan witnessed a sharp rise in terror attacks in November, with 61 incidents marking a 27% increase from the previous month, according to a report by the Pak Institute for Peace Studies (PIPS). The number of fatalities also surged by 69%, climbing from 100 in October to 169, with 225 others injured.The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), a banned group, carried out 12 attacks in November, including three high-impact incidents that resulted in 45 deaths. These figures surpassed the fatalities caused by the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), indicating a shift in the BLA's operational strategy. Experts suggest this escalation requires a reassessment of counterterrorism tactics.The majority of these attacks in Balochistan targeted security forces and civilians. Notable incidents included an assault on the Quetta railway station, an attack on a police van in Mastung, and a strike on a security check-post in Kalat, which collectively accounted for 91% of the province’s fatalities.Sectarian violence added another layer to the country's security challenges, particularly in the Kurram district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP). Seven incidents, including two terror attacks and five sectarian clashes, claimed 115 lives and left 137 injured. The violence was triggered by an attack on passenger buses on November 21, which spiraled into broader sectarian unrest.KP remained the most affected province, with 41 terrorist attacks leading to 114 deaths and 95 injuries. The TTP, Hafiz Gul Bahadur Group, Lashkar-i-Islam, and other local factions were linked to most of these incidents.The report also highlighted six incidents of border violence along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, resulting in 25 terrorist deaths and 11 injuries. This underscores the ongoing instability in the region and the challenges posed by cross-border insurgents.Security forces conducted 19 counterterrorism operations in November, killing 53 terrorists. Most of these operations were concentrated in KP and Balochistan, the epicenters of recent violence.The PIPS report paints a grim picture of Pakistan's security landscape, with 98 conflict-related incidents causing 338 deaths and 411 injuries in November alone. Experts suggest that the evolving nature of terror threats, including the increasing lethality of BLA operations and persistent sectarian tensions, requires urgent and innovative policy responses.As Pakistan grapples with these challenges, the question remains: can the state adapt quickly enough to address the multifaceted threats destabilizing the country?","Pakistan witnessed a sharp rise in terror attacks in November, with 61 incidents marking a 27% increase from the previous month.

This significant decision was communicated, local media reports said, by the Security Services Division (SSD) of the ministry of home affairs to the foreign affairs ministry.

ISLAMABAD: A Pakistan anti-terrorism court indicted on Thursday former prime minister Imran Khan along with dozens of other Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) politicians on charges of inciting supporters to attack the country’s military installations on May 9, 2023.Following Khan’s arrest on May 9 last year, his supporters had attacked and torched several military buildings and offices to protest against what they describe as the illegal detention of their leader. At least eight people were killed in the violence that followed Khan’s arrest on alleged graft charges.Khan pleaded not guilty to the charges while the court also indicted more than 60 others, including opposition leader in the National Assembly Omar Ayub, in the same case linked to the attack on the army’s General Headquarters (GHQ) in the garrison city of Rawalpindi. In addition, the court has ordered that detained former foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi , currently in Lahore jail, be produced in court.The court also ordered the arrests of several PTI politicians, including Ali Amin Gandapur, chief minister of the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province where Khan’s party has been in govt.

Following the indictment, the court fixed Dec 10 as the date for recording prosecution’s evidence.Khan has been facing anti-terrorism charges in connection with the violence, which is viewed as the most serious challenge to the military’s dominance in Pakistan’s history.

DAMASCUS: The main rebel commander Abu Mohammed al-Golani met overnight with Assad's PM Mohammed Jalali and vice-president Faisal Mekdad to discuss arrangements for a transitional govt, a source said. Jalali told Al Arabiya TV later on Monday that he had agreed to hand over power to the rebel "" Salvation Govt "".Golani, now using his real name Ahmed al-Sharaa, met Jalali ""to coordinate a transfer of power that guarantees the provision of services"" to Syria's people, said a statement on the rebels' Telegram channels.A short video of the meeting showed it was also attended by Mohammed al-Bashir, who heads the rebels' ""Salvation Govt"" in their northwest Syria bastion. In the video, Golani was heard telling the outgoing PM that although "" Idlib is a small region lacking resources"", authorities there ""have a very high-level of experience after starting with nothing"".Bashir's name has been circulating as the most likely candidate for PM in the transitional administration. Bashir ran the administration in a small pocket of rebel-held territory before the lightning offensive that swept into Damascus.According to a profile on the Salvation Govt's Facebook page, Bashir was born in Idlib province in 1983. He previously served as director of sharia education in Salvation Govt's ministry of religious endowments, and held a senior role in the ministry of development and humanitarian affairs. He obtained a degree in electrical engineering from Aleppo University in 2007, and another in sharia and law from Idlib University in 2021. The Salvation Govt, which has ministries, judicial and security authorities, was set up in 2017 to help people cut off from govt services in the stronghold.","Main rebel commander Abu Mohammed al-Golani met overnight with Assad's PM Mohammed Jalali and vice-president Faisal Mekdad.

In a virtual address to a gathering of overseas Awami League supporters in London on Sunday, Hasina accused Yunus of being the ""mastermind"" behind the July-August turmoil that ousted her government and vowed to bring him and his allies to justice under Bangladeshi law.She criticized Yunus and his interim government for their alleged persecution of religious minorities in Bangladesh.""Since August 5, the attacks on minorities, places of worship of Hindus, Christians and Buddhists have been rampant. We condemn it. The Jamaat and terrorists are having a free run under the new regime,"" she said.The audio recording of Hasina's address was shared on the Facebook page of the Bangladesh Students' League and Bangladesh Awami League.Her remarks came ahead of Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri's visit to Dhaka Monday where he raised India's concerns over the safety of minorities, flagging ""regrettable incidents of attacks on cultural, religious and diplomatic properties"" in the country.There have been a spate of incidents of violence against Hindus and other minorities, as well as attacks on temples in Bangladesh in the last few weeks that triggered strong concerns in New Delhi.""Bangladesh is now under the grip of a fascist regime where people's democratic rights have been obliterated. Our government's achievements in poverty alleviation and infrastructure development, strengthening of democracy were being undone under Yunus's leadership,"" Hasina said during her 37-minute virtual address over the phone.Hasina accused the Yunus government of providing clemency to terrorists and criminals, including those involved in arson and murders.""The release of convicted criminals and terrorists, including those responsible for attacks on the Bangladesh Parliament and other atrocities, proves the complicity of this government,"" she alleged.Hasina vowed that those responsible for the alleged atrocities under the Yunus administration would be brought to justice.""Md Yunus and his allies are the masterminds of the July-August unrest in the country. They are behind the killing of students and policemen, arson and atrocities. The murderers and conspirators who have harmed our nation will be held accountable under Bangladeshi law. Just as we took action against war criminals, justice will prevail for today's wrongdoers. No one will escape the law,"" she said.On August 5, the student-led Monsoon Revolution under the banner of ""Students Against Discrimination"" succeeded in toppling Sheikh Hasina's 16-year regime, propelled by fervent demands for change and accountability.After unprecedented anti-government protests, Hasina resigned as prime minister and fled the country. She landed in India on August 5 and is currently staying here.Hasina criticized Yunus and his government for their alleged persecution of religious minorities in Bangladesh.""Since August 5, the attacks on minorities, places of worship of Hindus, Christians and Buddhists have been rampant. We condemn it. The Jamaat and terrorists are having a free run under the new regime,"" she said.Hasina expressed outrage over the judicial and administrative repression under the current government, citing the case of Hindu monk Chinmoy Krishna Das as an example.""Chinmoy Krishna Das' lawyer was barred from contesting his case, a blatant violation of legal rights. This government is using every tool to suppress dissent and deny justice,"" she said.Chinmay Krishna Das, a prominent spokesperson for Bangladesh Sammilita Sanatani Jagran Jote, was arrested at Dhaka's Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport on Monday while en route to Chattogram for a rally. He was denied bail and remanded to jail on Tuesday. His arrest has further fueled concerns over the treatment of Hindus in Bangladesh.Condemning the ongoing oppression, Hasina declared, ""This dark chapter of our nation's history will not last forever. Mohammed Yunus will be held accountable for his actions, and justice will prevail.""Hasina further alleged that people are being subjected to brutal violence.""Innocent people have been beaten to death under this fascist regime. The rule of law has been completely eroded,"" she said, calling for accountability and justice.Hasina claimed that the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) has ignored allegations of financial irregularities involving Yunus and his organization, Grameen Bank.""They accuse my government of corruption but fail to provide evidence. Meanwhile, Yunus's activities remain unchecked by the ACC,"" she said, reiterating her challenge for the interim government to substantiate its allegations against her.Hasina claimed that since August, more than a thousand leaders and workers of the Awami League have been killed, their homes looted, and their businesses destroyed.She claimed that members of her party were being systematically targeted and that these incidents were part of a broader conspiracy to eliminate the Awami League's influence.""All units of the Awami League have been subjected to attacks. The homes and businesses of our leaders have been looted. Those who are reporting these atrocities face severe consequences under the current regime,"" she stated.While concluding her virtual address, Hasina expressed hope for a brighter future, assuring the people that ""a new dawn will soon break, dispelling the darkness that has engulfed our country.""","Bangladesh's deposed premier Sheikh Hasina has launched a fierce attack on the interim administration.

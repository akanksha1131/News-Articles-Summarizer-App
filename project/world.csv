'Regret voting for him': Trump supporter's British wife faces deportation; lived legally in US for 37 years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/regret-voting-for-him-trump-supporters-british-wife-faces-deportation-lived-legally-in-us-for-37-years/articleshow/123688775.cms,"Representational AI image





A 59-year-old British woman, wife of a Trump supporter, who has lived legally in the United States for more than three decades, is facing deportation after being detained at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport.Donna Hughes-Brown, originally from England, is the wife of James Brown, a Trump supporter who now says he regrets his vote. She was stopped on July 29 after returning from a holiday in Ireland, held in Chicago for five days, and then transferred to a detention facility in Kentucky.James Brown says he “100 per cent” regrets backing Trump, blaming the US president’s immigration purge for his wife’s case. “You look at the news, and they're not telling the truth about what's actually happening to a lot of legal immigrants. What's bad is that Trump is so demeaning to people, and he's so condescending and so retaliatory that people are afraid to say anything,” he said as quoted by Mirror.The case against Hughes-Brown relates to a misdemeanour from 2015, which her husband says was resolved years ago.Hughes-Brown has held a US green card for more than 37 years, renewing it twice, and has built her life around her four children and five grandchildren.Her bond hearing, delayed due to a clerical error, was later denied twice under new legislation. She remains in custody in Kentucky.Brown described his wife as active in her community, helping single mothers, maintaining free food “blessing boxes” and organising aid for families after Hurricane Helene last year.“We helped with supplies for Hurricane Helene. We do volunteer work all the time. We give to single mothers. We help out military families. We have a son who is a Marine, and this is our payment,” said Brown who himself served in the US Navy from 1985 to 2005.If deported, Hughes-Brown could be barred from returning to the US for 10 years.","Donna Hughes-Brown, originally from England, is the wife of James Brown, a Trump supporter.

US President Donald Trump on Wednesday said that America may have to suffer ""greatly"" and can be ""unbelievably poor again"" if it loses a Supreme Court case.Speaking to Reporters at the White House, Trump explained the consequences US may face if the Supreme Court didn't reverse the appeals court ruling from last week that found his tariffs were ""illegal. "" He said that US might have to ""unwind"" the trade deals it reached with European Union, Japan, South Korea and others.""We made a deal with the European Union where they're paying us almost a trillion dollars. And you know what? They're happy. It's done. These deals are all done,"" he said. ""I guess we'd have to unwind them,"" he added.However, later, the Trump administration took the fight over tariffs to the Supreme Court, requesting it to reverse the appeals court ruling.Trump, while speaking to the reporters, had said that US has a chance a ""become unbelievably rich again"" and warned of the opposite if Supreme Court didn't reverse the order.""Our country has a chance to be unbelievably rich again. It could also be unbelievably poor again. If we don't win that case, our country is going to suffer so greatly, so greatly,"" Trump said.Meanwhile, trade experts asserted that Trump's comments are intended to convince the Supreme Court that ruling against tariffs may unleash major economic chaos.""The president's announcement today that the deals could be unwound reflects an effort to maximise leverage on the US side,"" Ryan Majerus, a former senior US trade official, told Reuters.","US President Donald Trump on Wednesday said that America may have to suffer ""greatly"" and can be ""unbelievably poor again"" if it loses a Supreme Court case.

Kim Jong-un brings a guest to Beijing: His daughter and potential heir,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/kim-jong-un-brings-a-guest-to-beijing-his-daughter-and-potential-heir/articleshow/123688471.cms,"



North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un, travelled to Beijing this week to hobnob with the presidents of China and Russia, two of his nation's key allies. But he seems to have had another purpose for the trip: introducing his daughter as his potential successor.Kim Ju-ae, accompanied Kim to Beijing, where he joined leaders from more than 20 countries at a military parade on Wednesday. After the special train carrying Kim's entourage pulled into Beijing Railway Station on Tuesday, Ju-ae stood close to Kim as he was greeted by senior Chinese officials, as per photographs released by North Korean media. It is the first overseas trip that Ju-ae is known to have taken with Kim.Ju-ae, believed to be 12 years old, is the only child of Kim to have appeared in the North's state media, which refers to her as ""dear daughter"". Since late 2022, she has accompanied her father to military parades, weapons tests and other politically significant domestic events.South Korean analysts have said Kim appears to be grooming her as an heir, though they have also been careful not to jump to conclusions. The fact that he brought Ju-ae on his first trip to China in six years, and to a major gathering, is a significant new sign of her rising status, some said.Yang Moo-jin, a former president of Seoul-based University of North Korean Studies, said the girl was going through the ritual of ""introducing herself"" to the leadership of China, North Korea's most important ally. The scene at the Beijing station ""showed that she was being treated as No. 2 of North Korea not only at home but also abroad,"" said Cheong Seong-chang, a North Korea expert at Seoul-based Sejong Institute. ""By taking her to China, Kim Jong-un is sending a strong signal to the world that she is going to be his successor.""Although Kim was designated as the successor of his father, Kim Jong-il, at an early age, that status was kept secret until his father suffered a stroke in 2008. The gathering in Beijing highlighted Kim's transformation from a nuclear-armed international pariah into a global player. He has built up diplomatic leverage by growing closer with China amid the rivalry between Beijing and Washington, and by intervening in Russia's war against Ukraine.After the parade, Putin and Kim travelled in the Russian leader's car to the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing, where they held talks for two and a half hours, according to Russian media. Putin thanked Kim for helping his war effort in Ukraine by sending troops and weapons. Kim said he cherished the new alliance treaty the two leaders signed last year in Pyongyang. North Korea considered helping Moscow ""a fraternal duty,"" Kim was quoted as saying by Russian news agency Tass. ""If there is anything we can do to help Russia, we will definitely do it,"" he added. nyt","Kim Jong-un travelled to Beijing to hobnob with the presidents of China and Russia, two of his nation's key allies.

US President Donald Trump on Wednesday laughed off wild social media speculation about his health, and even his supposed death, after several days away from the cameras.The 79-year-old Republican, famous for his love of publicity, had not scheduled public events or press briefings for nearly a week.The unusual silence, paired with his age and recent images showing a bruised hand and swollen ankles, sent rumor mills into overdrive. Some users on X even claimed the White House was hiding his death.“I didn’t see that,” Trump said when Fox News’ Peter Doocy jokingly asked him, “How did you find out over the weekend that you were dead?” Trump smirked, replying: “That’s fake news. I didn’t do anything for two days and they say, ‘there must be something wrong with him.’ Biden wouldn’t do anything for months…”The White House has previously addressed Trump’s health concerns.In July, officials said discoloration on his hand came from “tissue irritation from frequent handshaking” and aspirin use for cardiovascular care.His swollen ankles were linked to chronic venous insufficiency, a benign condition caused by weakened leg veins. His physician, Dr Sean Barbabella, reassured in a letter that Trump “remains in excellent health.”Trump has long bragged about his stamina, even once sharing a meme portraying himself as Superman. But with the two oldest presidents in US history, Biden at 82 when he left office and Trump now 79, health rumors are under heavier scrutiny than ever.","The 79-year-old Republican had not scheduled public events or press briefings for nearly a week.

‘No tax on tips’: Streamers and influencers included in the US Act; mid-level creators benefit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/no-tax-on-tips-streamers-and-influencers-included-in-the-us-act-mid-level-creators-benefit/articleshow/123667981.cms,"AI image





Digital content creators, including streamers and influencers, will be able to claim tax deductions on the tips they earn starting next year. The move comes under Donald Trump’s “no tax on tips” policy, a key campaign promise passed by Congress in July.According to a draft list of eligible jobs, reported by Axios, the policy covers workers who earn tips “customarily and regularly.” This includes online video creators, podcasters, social media influencers, and streamers. It also applies to food service staff, musicians, dancers, and hospitality workers.The law allows workers to deduct up to $25,000 of tip income, with the benefit phasing out for individuals earning more than $150,000 or couples earning above $300,000 annually. Top-earning creators on platforms like Twitch and TikTok will not qualify, but mid-level influencers and small streamers are expected to benefit.On digital platforms, tips are often called by different names—Twitch “bits,” TikTok “gifts,” YouTube “Super Chats,” and OnlyFans “tip menus.” For creators who rely on this income, the deduction could ease tax pressure.The policy takes effect immediately, meaning qualifying workers can claim deductions for tips received in 2024 when they file their returns early next year. However, the scheme is temporary and set to expire after 2028 unless extended by Congress.The Republican senate of the US unanimously passed the “no tax on tips” bill in May. Surprisingly, the “no tax on tips” provision received unanimous bipartisan acceptance.","Digital content creators will be able to claim tax deductions on the tips they earn starting next year.

US president Donald Trump has a low approval rating, according to recent surveys by Gallup, Reuters/Ipsos and other pollsters.More than seven months into his presidency, the numbers show continued low approval, with Americans divided over his handling of the economy, immigration and the deployment of troops in Washington DC.Gallup’s August survey reported that 40% of Americans approve of Trump’s performance, while 56% disapprove. RealClearPolitics put his net approval margin at minus five points at the end of August, and The New York Times tracker showed minus eight.These figures keep Trump below the first-year ratings of earlier presidents such as Barack Obama, George W.

Maduro Warns Trump: ‘Rubio Leading U.S. To Bloodbath’ In Venezuela Power Showdown

Venezuelan government responds







President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced that US forces killed 11 “narcoterrorists” while carrying out a strike on a drug-carrying vessel linked to Venezuelan gangs. Trump alleged the gang was controlled by Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro.""Earlier this morning, on my Orders, US Military Forces conducted a kinetic strike against positively identified Tren de Aragua Narcoterrorists in the SOUTHCOM area of responsibility,” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social, while sharing footage of the attack.""The strike occurred while the terrorists were at sea in International waters transporting illegal narcotics, heading to the United States. The strike resulted in 11 terrorists killed in action. No US Forces were harmed in this strike,” he said.The strike is part of broader US counter-narcotics efforts to strengthen maritime operations off Venezuela and combat threats from Latin American drug cartels. While thousands of US personnel are being deployed, officials have not indicated any plans for a land incursion into Venezuela.“Please let this serve as notice to anybody even thinking about bringing drugs into the United States of America,” Trump added.Earlier on Wednesday while speaking at the Oval Office, Trump described the operation as part of ongoing counter-narcotics efforts in the southern Caribbean.“The US forces shot out a boat… a drug-carrying boat, lots of drugs in that boat,” he said. “So we took it out.”Secretary of state Marco Rubio also addressed the operation on X, calling it a lethal strike and noting that the vessel was operated by a “designated narco-terrorist organisation.” Rubio made the comments shortly before departing for Mexico and Ecuador to discuss drug cartels, regional security, and trade issues.Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro responded by deploying troops along the coast and the border with Colombia and urged citizens to join a civilian militia. Maduro has repeatedly claimed that the US is exaggerating Venezuela’s role in drug trafficking to remove him from power.He and other government officials have cited a United Nations report indicating that traffickers move only a small fraction of Colombia’s cocaine through Venezuela.On Monday, Maduro told reporters he “would constitutionally declare a republic in arms” if Venezuela were attacked by US forces deployed in the Caribbean.The Venezuelan government’s press office did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Trump’s announcement, and the Pentagon also declined to provide a statement.The latest UN World Drug Report shows that South American countries, including Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru, reported increased cocaine seizures in 2022 compared with 2021, but Venezuela is not highlighted as a central hub of trafficking.","US President Donald Trump announced that US forces killed 11 ""narcoterrorists"" while carrying out a strike on a drug-carrying vessel linked to Venezuelan gangs.

Trump administration on Wednesday appealed to Supreme Court after a federal US appeals court ruled that the US president did not have the authority to impose sweeping tariffs on foreign imports.“That decision casts a pall of uncertainty upon ongoing foreign negotiations that the President has been pursuing through tariffs over the past five months, jeopardizing both already negotiated framework deals and ongoing negotiations,” the Trump administration argued in its appeal. “The stakes in this case could not be higher.”This comes as Donald Trump said that US might have to ""unwind"" trade deals it reached with the European Union, Japan and South Korea, among others, if it loses the case, and warned that a loss would cause the US ""to suffer so greatly.""""We made a deal with the European Union where they're paying us almost a trillion dollars. And you know what? They're happy. It's done. These deals are all done,"" he said. ""I guess we'd have to unwind them.""""Our country has a chance to be unbelievably rich again. It could also be unbelievably poor again. If we don't win that case, our country is going to suffer so greatly, so greatly,"" he added.An attorney for the small businesses rocked by the tariffs, Jeffrey Schwab with the Liberty Justice Center, said the stakes are also high for his clients.“These unlawful tariffs are inflicting serious harm on small businesses and jeopardizing their survival. We hope for a prompt resolution of this case for our clients,” he said.The ruling by the US court of appeals for the federal circuit in Washington, DC, covered two sets of tariffs - Trump’s “reciprocal” duties imposed in April as part of his trade war and another set announced in February against China, Canada and Mexico. It does not affect other tariffs Trump imposed under separate statutes, including those on steel and aluminum imports.In a 7-4 judgement the court observed: “The statute bestows significant authority on the President to undertake a number of actions in response to a declared national emergency, but none of these actions explicitly include the power to impose tariffs, duties, or the like, or the power to tax,” as quoted by Reuters.The decision also said Trump had exceeded his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).","US appeals court rules that Donald Trump did not have authority to impose sweeping tariffs on foreign imports.

A federal jury has ordered Alphabet’s Google to pay $425 million after finding the company violated users’ privacy by continuing to collect data even when millions had switched off a key tracking feature.The verdict, delivered on Wednesday in a San Francisco court, followed a class-action lawsuit filed in July 2020, which alleged that Google had gathered and stored users’ information over eight years, despite privacy assurances tied to its 'Web & App Activity' setting. Plaintiffs had sought more than $31 billion in damages.Jurors found Google liable on two of three privacy claims but said the company had not acted with malice, sparing it from punitive damages, according to Reuters. A Google spokesperson confirmed the verdict, though the company had denied wrongdoing throughout the trial.The lawsuit alleged Google continued harvesting user data through its ties with apps such as Uber, Venmo, and Instagram, which rely on Google analytics services. Google countered that the data collected was “nonpersonal, pseudonymous, and stored in secured, encrypted locations,” not linked to individual accounts, a report from Reuters said.US district judge Richard Seeborg certified the case as a class action covering roughly 98 million users and 174 million devices.The ruling adds to Google’s mounting privacy battles. Earlier this year, the company agreed to pay $1.4 billion to settle claims in Texas over state privacy law violations. In April 2024, it agreed to erase billions of records from its “Incognito” browsing mode following another lawsuit accusing it of secretly tracking private activity.","Jurors found Google liable on two of three privacy claims but said the company had not acted with malice, sparing it from punitive damages.

Childhood Vaccines: Florida to work to end mandates for children





Florida will become the first state in the US to move towards scrapping all childhood vaccine mandates, governor Ron DeSantis announced on Wednesday. The decision, unveiled at a news conference in Valrico, builds on his push during the Covid-19 pandemic to limit health requirements and expand what he calls “medical freedom. ”DeSantis said the plan will be supported by a new “Make America healthy again” (MAHA) commission, to be chaired by Lt. governor Jay Collins and first lady Casey DeSantis. The panel will look into medical consent, parental rights, safe food choices and policies that challenge “medical orthodoxy not backed by data.” Its recommendations will feed into a legislative package next session aimed at ending vaccine mandates written into state law.Florida surgeon general Dr Joseph Ladapo strongly backed the move, describing current vaccine requirements in schools and childcare facilities as an “immoral” intrusion that restricts parental choice. “People have a right to make their own informed decisions,” Ladapo said. “They don’t have the right to tell you what to put in your body.” He added that some rules could be removed directly by the health department, while others would need action from lawmakers.Currently, Florida requires children to be vaccinated against measles, chickenpox, hepatitis B, diphtheria, polio and whooping cough to attend schools or day care centres. Ladapo said the goal was to end “all of them, every last one of them.”DeSantis argued that Florida has led the way in resisting strict health measures, pointing to the state’s refusal to enforce Covid vaccine mandates, vaccine passports, school closures or job requirements. “I don’t think there’s another state that’s done as much as Florida. We want to stay ahead of the curve,” he said.","Florida will become the first state in the US to move towards scrapping all childhood vaccine mandates, governor Ron DeSantis announced on Wednesday.

Vice President JD Vance on Wednesday visited Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis to honour victims of last week’s mass shooting that left two children dead and 21 others injured. The solemn visit, however, was marked by protests across the street, where demonstrators waved pride flags and heckled him with chants of “do better” and “you’re a coward.”Vance, accompanied by his wife Usha, paused briefly at a statue of the Virgin Mary before entering the church, where he met families of victims. He later told reporters the experience was “heartbreaking but also gratifying,” noting that grieving parents shared stories of their children’s lives, hopes, and dreams.“I have never had a day that will stay with me like this one,” Vance said. “We should talk less about the shooter and more about these kids. Their lives were cut short, and that should be the focus.”Police identified the gunman as 23-year-old Robin Westman, who opened fire during a school Mass with three legally purchased firearms. Court records show Westman, born Robert, changed names in 2019. FBI Director Kash Patel confirmed the shooter’s identity.Protesters outside the church carried signs reading “protect kids not guns,” underscoring frustrations over gun violence. Conservative columnist Dustin Grage criticised the demonstration online, calling it “tone-deaf.”Vance, a practising Catholic, urged prayers for those still hospitalised and pledged to push for policies that address the root causes of such attacks. “One of the ways I’ll honour these parents is by being a better dad,” he said. “There are families who will never again get that chance.”","Vice President JD Vance visited Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis to honour victims of last week’s mass shooting that left two children dead and 21 others injured.

Harvard says cuts were payback

Trump denies retaliation









Harvard University scored a major legal victory on Wednesday after a federal judge blocked the Trump administration’s cuts to more than $2.6 billion in federal research grants.US district judge Allison Burroughs ruled that the administration’s actions amounted to illegal retaliation against the Ivy League school for rejecting White House demands to change its governance and policies.The ruling reverses a series of funding freezes that later became outright cuts as the Trump administration escalated its battle with Harvard. If it stands, the decision will restore hundreds of research projects that had lost federal funding, according to AP.Burroughs noted that the government had tied the freezes to Harvard’s handling of antisemitism on campus, but found little connection between the research grants and the university’s efforts to combat discrimination.“A review of the administrative record makes it difficult to conclude anything other than that Defendants used antisemitism as a smokescreen for a targeted, ideologically-motivated assault on this country's premier universities,” she wrote.Harvard’s lawsuit claims the Trump administration retaliated after the university rejected demands outlined in an April 11 letter from a federal antisemitism task force. The letter had called for sweeping changes in campus policies, academic programs, and admissions, citing concerns over alleged antisemitism and liberal bias.Harvard President Alan Garber said the university is committed to fighting antisemitism but emphasised that “no government should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue,"" as quoted by AP.The Trump administration denied retaliating against Harvard, arguing the grants were under review even before the April 11 letter was sent. Officials said they have the authority to cancel federal contracts for policy reasons. “It is the policy of the United States under the Trump Administration not to fund institutions that fail to adequately address antisemitism in their programs,” court filings stated.Beyond the courtroom, Harvard and federal officials are discussing a potential agreement that could restore access to federal funding. President Trump has said he wants Harvard to pay no less than $500 million, though no deal has been finalised. The administration has reached settlements with other universities, including Columbia and Brown.",Harvard University scored a major legal victory on Wednesday after a federal judge blocked the Trump administration’s cuts to more than $2.6 billion in federal research grants.

A 13-year-old girl was killed and three of her relatives were seriously injured when a small plane crashed in the Bighorn Mountains of northern Wyoming, authorities said Tuesday.The crash happened late Monday afternoon near Big Mountain, an 8,200-foot peak about 15 miles west of Sheridan. A medical service helicopter spotted the wreckage after being asked to fly over the area in Bighorn National Forest, according to the Sheridan county sheriff’s office, reported CBS News.Rescue crews established a command post off US Highway 14 and were flown to the site, where they found the girl dead and three survivors — an 11-year-old boy, a 53-year-old woman, and a 54-year-old man.Two of the injured were airlifted to a hospital in Billings, Montana, and another was taken to a hospital in Sheridan. The medical helicopter also carried the girl’s body back to the command post, where it was transferred to the county coroner.Federal officials said the downed aircraft was a Piper PA-28-180. The victims’ names have not been officially released, but thereported the family was from Boise. The newspaper identified the girl as Amelia Palmer and said her parents, Earl and Cindy Palmer, remained in critical condition, while her younger brother suffered only minor injuries.A GoFundMe campaign for the family had raised more than $25,000 as of Wednesday morning.The federal aviation administration and the national transportation safety board are investigating the cause of the crash. Sheridan county Sheriff Levi Dominguez praised the joint rescue effort, saying, “The coordinated effort between all of the rescuers, EMS, medical teams, and aircraft personnel was exceptional. This was, and still is, a very fluid scene. Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims’ and their family,” as quoted by CBS News.","The crash happened late Monday afternoon near Big Mountain, an 8,200-foot peak about 15 miles west of Sheridan.

Chicago, Baltimore also in Trump’s sights





US President Donald Trump on Wednesday floated the idea of sending the National Guard to New Orleans, raising the prospect of expanding federal law enforcement operations to more US cities.“So we’re making a determination now,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office during a meeting with Polish President Karol Nawrocki.“Do we go to Chicago? Do we go to a place like New Orleans, where we have a great governor, Jeff Landry, who wants us to come in and straighten out a very nice section of this country that’s become quite, you know, quite tough, quite bad.” he said, as quoted by AP.The president said New Orleans’ crime problem could be fixed quickly.“So we’re going to be going to maybe Louisiana, and you have New Orleans, which has a crime problem. We’ll straighten that out in about two weeks,” Trump said. “It’ll take us two weeks, easier than DC”City leaders, however, rejected the idea. “Crime is down in New Orleans,” City Councilmember Oliver Thomas, also a mayoral candidate, said via text. “That would seem to be very political or a major overreaction!”Trump’s comments followed his earlier pledge, “We’re going in,"" about deploying the National Guard to Chicago and Baltimore.Local officials have firmly opposed the plan. Illinois governer JB Pritzker and Chicago mayor Brandon Johnson, along with Maryland governer Wes Moore and Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott, all said their cities do not want federal intervention.“We could straighten out Chicago. All they have to do is ask us to go into Chicago,” Trump said, as quoted by AP. “If we don’t have the support of some of these politicians, but I’ll tell you who is supporting us, the people of Chicago.”Trump often points to Washington, DC, as proof of success, calling it a “safe zone” after deploying federal agents and troops. The White House says more than 1,760 arrests have been made since August 7.But unlike DC, which is under federal authority, Trump’s plan to send forces into other Democratic-led cities would mark a major escalation. In Louisiana, the dynamic is different: New Orleans is controlled by Democrats, but the state is run by Republican governer Jeff Landry, who backs Trump’s idea.Washington mayor Muriel Bowser has said violent crime fell after Trump’s intervention, but argued the same results could have been achieved by adding more local police officers instead of deploying the National Guard.","US President Donald Trump floats the idea of sending the National Guard to New Orleans.

And they were hoping I was watching — and I was watching,” Trump said, as quoted by The New York Post, describing the display as a calculated show of strength.The event marked the 80th anniversary of Japan’s defeat in World War II and featured Xi and Putin alongside North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Belarus President Aleksandr Lukashenko. China used the parade to showcase its massive military power to the world.Speaking after the ceremony, Trump said his relationships with China, Russia and India were “very good,” but added, “we’re going to find out how good it is over the next week or two.”Asked whether he had been invited to attend the Beijing parade, Trump said he would not have gone even if he had. “It wouldn’t have been my place,” he said.Earlier during the week, Trump criticised Xi for failing to acknowledge the United States’ role in World War II. “I watched [Xi’s] speech last night. President Xi is a friend of mine, but I thought that the United States should have been mentioned last night during that speech, because we helped China very much,” he said.Trump also took to social media with a sharper message: “Please give my warmest regards to Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong Un, as you conspire against The United States of America.

Final days and $6,000 ketamine deal





Jasveen Sangha, the dealer dubbed the “Ketamine Queen,” pleaded guilty Wednesday to supplying the ketamine that killed Friends star Matthew Perry.The 42-year-old US and UK citizen admitted to multiple federal charges that could carry a prison sentence of up to 65 years. Sangha pleaded guilty to one count of maintaining a drug-involved premises, three counts of ketamine distribution, and one count of distribution resulting in death.Prosecutors agreed to drop additional charges, including methamphetamine distribution unrelated to Perry’s case. Sentencing will be scheduled later, with prosecutors noting they will seek less than the maximum penalty.The plea marks the conclusion of a yearlong investigation announced after Perry’s Oct. 28, 2023 death. Sangha is the fifth and final defendant in the case to plead guilty, joining Dr Salvador Plasencia, Dr Mark Chavez, Perry’s assistant Kenneth Iwamasa, and friend Erik Fleming.Perry, 54, was found unresponsive in his Los Angeles home by Iwamasa. The medical examiner ruled ketamine the primary cause of death. Perry had been receiving ketamine legally through his doctor as an off-label treatment for depression but sought additional supplies.According to prosecutors, Perry paid Sangha $6,000 in cash for 25 vials of ketamine just four days before his death. Fleming had connected Perry with Sangha, calling her drugs “amazing” and saying she only dealt “with high end and celebs.” On the day Perry died, Sangha urged Fleming to delete their messages.Federal prosecutors described Sangha as a prolific supplier with wealthy and celebrity clients. On social media, she flaunted a lavish lifestyle, sharing photos from luxury destinations alongside influential figures.Sangha and Plasencia were the primary targets of the probe, with the other co-defendants providing testimony that helped build the case against them. None of the defendants have been sentenced.Perry’s long struggle with addiction dated back to his years on Friends, where he became a household name as Chandler Bing. He starred alongside Jennifer Aniston , Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, and David Schwimmer for 10 seasons from 1994 to 2004, cementing his place as one of television’s most beloved actors.","Jasveen Sangha, 42, pleaded guilty to multiple federal charges that could carry a prison sentence of up to 65 years.

After Russia's Threat, Poland Rules Out Military Deployment In Post-War Ukraine





US President Donald Trump on Wednesday offered to increase the US military presence in Poland during a meeting with Polish President Karol Nawrocki at the White House.Nawrocki, a nationalist historian and longtime Trump supporter, made Washington his first foreign visit since taking office. He had previously campaigned with Trump’s backing during Poland’s election and emphasised the importance of strengthening US-Poland ties.Standing alongside Nawrocki in the Oval Office, Trump said, as quoted by AFP, “We’ll put more there if they want. We’re with Poland all the way and we’ll help Poland protect itself.”The US president also commented on the war in Ukraine, calling it a “stupid war” but adding, “It’s going to get done. I thought ending it would have been much easier for me.”Nawrocki welcomed the offer, praising the US troop presence. He said it was “the first time in history” that Poland had been happy to host foreign troops and stressed Warsaw’s goal of continuing to increase its defense spending within Nato.The White House arranged a flyover of F-16 and F-35 jets to honor a Polish F-16 pilot who died last week while preparing for an air show.Deputy press secretary Anna Kelly said the “missing-man formation” was staged to “honor the memory of a brave Polish fighter pilot, whose life was tragically taken too soon, and capture the special relationship between our two countries,"" reported AFP.Poland, a key Nato and EU member, has been a major supporter of Ukraine since Russia’s 2022 invasion. The country serves as a critical transit hub for military and humanitarian aid and hosts thousands of US troops.Warsaw has largely been sidelined in Trump’s efforts to bring Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the negotiating table. On Wednesday, Putin vowed in Beijing to continue fighting if a peace deal cannot be reached, while Zelenskyy said he hoped to speak with Trump about potential additional sanctions against Russia.Nawrocki is also seeking US backing amid political tensions at home with Poland’s pro-EU government led by former European Council chief Donald Tusk.

A relatively unknown militant group, Ittihad-ul-Mujahideen (IuM) Pakistan, has claimed responsibility for the suicide car bomb attack on the Federal Constabulary Corps in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Bannu division on Tuesday.The outfit claimed the attack, which involved a car rigged with IED, killed more than two dozen members of the Frontier Corps but Pakistan acknowledged only six fatalities. Predictably, it blamed India for the attack. Pakistan claimed to have neutralised five operatives in a 12-hour counter operation but the group asserted that its 'fidayeen' blew themselves up after carrying out the attack. One of the suicide bombers was identified by the group as Abdul Aziz alias Qassid Mohajir, a resident of Afghanistan's Paktika province.The Pakistan army camp suffered massive destruction in the suicide attack.

""During early hours of Sept 2, Indian proxy 'Fitna al Khwarij' targeted the Federal Constabulary Headquarters in Bannu district. The Indian-sponsored Kharjis attempted to breach the perimeter security, however, their nefarious designs were swiftly foiled by vigilant and resolute response.In their desperation, the Kahrjis rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into the perimeter wall. The suicide blast resulted in the partial collapse of the perimeter wall and damage to adjacent civilian infrastructure, inflicting injuries to three innocent civilians,"" ISPR said.IuM Pakistan, active since April, comprises fighters from outfits like Hafiz Gul Bahadur Group, Lashkar-e-Islam and Jamaat-Ul-Ahrar. In the last few months, it has claimed multiple attacks in areas like North Waziristan, Miranshah and Tirah Valley. Its strikes included sniper, rocket launcher and grenade attacks, and ambushes on convoys, besides drone strikes. Its formation had attracted criticism from groups like Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan which termed itself as the most structured and legitimate jihadi group in Pakistan.","Ittihad-ul-Mujahideen (IuM) Pakistan has claimed responsibility for the suicide car bomb attack on the Federal Constabulary Corps in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Bannu division on Tuesday.

Op Sindoor: Report Reveals Pakistan Lost Rs 1240cr In 2 Months After Shutting Airspace For India

The Express Tribune





Pakistan’s flagship social safety programme, the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), is once again under fire for corruption, with the Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP) uncovering large-scale graft involving its own employees. According to audit findings, as many as 324 officials, from the lowest Grade 1 to the highest Grade 22, embezzled over Rs 37 million, local media reported on Sunday.Citing the AGP’s revelations,said the rot runs through every level of the bureaucracy. What was envisioned as a lifeline for the country’s poorest has been consistently hollowed out by systemic fraud and abuse. And the Rs 37 million loss, auditors warn, may only scratch the surface.Just months earlier, audit reports for FY24 exposed irregularities worth Rs 141 billion in BISP, ranging from payments to ineligible beneficiaries to bogus biometric verifications and even funds being transferred to the accounts of deceased individuals.“In effect, those entrusted with administering aid to the poor are instead perpetuating poverty,” the report noted.The AGP findings also highlight the involvement of not just BISP employees but also banks and retailers, some of whom were caught illegally skimming fees from beneficiaries using BISP cards. Despite being identified, several perpetrators reportedly “escaped criminal charges despite being caught red-handed and named publicly,”reported.The culture of impunity, it added, remains entrenched. “Even if guilty officials are prosecuted and terminated, recent history has shown that the fear of consequences has not particularly slowed corruption in most government departments, and BISP is no different.”The report stressed that the system’s checks must be tightened: “Controls need to be more proactive, including transparent biometric systems, stricter verification processes and independent monitoring mechanisms.”With BISP catering to roughly 58 million people—nearly a quarter of Pakistan’s population—its credibility carries enormous weight. “Allowing it to become a corrupt and untrusted institution is not just a betrayal of honest and deserving beneficiaries, but of every single taxpayer and international donor supporting the programme,” the report warned.","As many as 324 officials, from the lowest Grade 1 to the highest Grade 22, embezzled over Rs 37 million.

Flood Threat For Pakistan As India Releases Water From Swollen Rivers Day After Alerting Islamabad





AMRITSAR: Embarrassed by a viral video showing its side of the parade path at Wagah border badly waterlogged - and its Rangers standing in knee-deep water - while the Indian side looks clean, Pakistan has blamed the elevation of Grand Trunk Road on the Indian side for the mess.The fact is India has already implemented a rainwater harvesting system and improved drainage management to prevent waterlogging.Pakistan is battling severe floods after relentless heavy rain over the past few days. Its side of the parade area at the site of the daily flag ceremony at the Wagah joint checkpost is wallowing in muddy knee-deep water. Sandbags are seen piled up at a few places on the Pakistani side ahead of the ceremony. In contrast, the Indian side is free of water, except for a small area near the international border gates.Sources say Pakistan has raised the elevation of GT Road with Indian authorities. Pakistan also hastily constructed drainage channels and elevated a portion of the road to facilitate water outflow. BSF IG, Punjab Frontier, Atul Fulzele said there was incessant and heavy rainfall on Aug 8-9, and the video was likely from that period.""There has been no waterlogging at any of the three sites of the ceremonial flag-lowering ceremonies - Attari, Hussainiwala, and Sadqi.

Hundreds Killed, 1000 Injured As Powerful Quake Flattens Afghanistan | Shocking Scenes On Cam





Thousands of Afghan refugees with official registration documents are being forced out of Pakistan, even as their homeland reels from a devastating earthquake that killed more than 1,400 people last weekend.AFP reported. quoting officials that the returns have sharply escalated in recent days, with families crossing the border in fear of arrest and harassment.Pakistan has hosted Afghan refugees for over four decades, from those fleeing the Soviet invasion in the 1980s to those escaping after the Taliban’s 2021 takeover.While many Afghans built lives in Pakistan, gaining access to work and education, others were born and raised there or were waiting to be resettled in the West.However, Islamabad has tightened its stance, blaming Afghan refugees for a surge in violence and militancy. Earlier in 2023, the government launched a sweeping crackdown, branding Afghans as “terrorists and criminals” and ordering mass expulsions.Since then, more than 1.2 million Afghans have been sent back, including 443,000 this year alone, according to UN figures, the agency reported.The latest phase of the campaign is targeting some 1.3 million Afghans holding Proof of Registration (PoR) cards issued by the UN refugee agency.They were given until September 1 to leave voluntarily or face detention and deportation.In the weeks leading up to the deadline, Afghan families reported police raids, extortion and harassment, prompting many to flee in convoys toward the border.UNHCR data shows a sharp increase in August, with 25,490 Afghans returning between August 24 and 30, more than half of them PoR holders.""Police used to detain us repeatedly. They seized our belongings,"" said Khan Wali, an Afghan returnee who fled Lahore, speaking from the Spin Boldak border crossing. Others reported a slightly easier situation in opposition-held Peshawar, though they said “people are facing hell” in Islamabad.The forced returns coincide with Afghanistan’s recovery from a 6.0-magnitude quake that destroyed entire villages, including areas where many of the newly returned migrants had settled.Analysts believe Pakistan’s expulsions are aimed at pressuring the Taliban administration in Kabul, which Islamabad accuses of allowing insurgents to stage cross-border attacks. The Taliban, however, has rejected those claims.","Pakistan has hosted Afghan refugees for over four decades, from those fleeing the Soviet invasion in the 1980s to those escaping after the Taliban’s 2021 takeover.

Implications of the deal

Qatar, Egypt and the United States announced on Wednesday that Israel and Hamas have reached a ceasefire and hostage release agreement, marking a potential turning point in one of the most devastating conflicts between the two sides.Set to take effect on January 19, the deal outlines a three-stage process aimed at achieving a ""sustainable calm."" The framework includes the release of hostages and prisoners, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from populated areas, and the resumption of humanitarian aid operations.If implemented, this agreement could end the bloodiest chapter in Israel-Hamas relations, although it leaves the broader Israeli-Palestinian conflict unresolved.The following are the detailed components of the ceasefire arrangement:The first stage involves a temporary cessation of military operations between Israel and Hamas. Hamas will release 33 women and children hostages, along with hostages over 50 years old. Israel will free 30 Palestinian women and children for each Israeli hostage returned, CBS news reported.Additionally, Palestinian prisoners aged 50 or older will be released. Israeli forces will withdraw from populated areas in Gaza, and military air operations will pause for 10 hours daily, extending to 12 hours during prisoner exchanges. Large-scale aid, including food, fuel, and medical supplies, will be allowed into Gaza.In the second stage, both sides will declare a halt to all military operations. According to Arab Center Washington DC, all remaining male Israeli hostages, including civilians and soldiers, will be released in exchange for Palestinian detainees. Israeli forces will fully withdraw from Gaza.The third stage will see the exchange of the bodies of deceased hostages and combatants returned to their respective sides. A three-to-five-year plan will commence, focusing on rebuilding homes, infrastructure, and civilian facilities. The process will be overseen by Egypt, Qatar, and the United Nations. The complete blockade of Gaza will be lifted, enabling economic recovery and humanitarian relief.The agreement mirrors a proposal previously outlined by US President Joe Biden. Notably, the deal prioritizes the release of American hostages early in the process.The conflict, which began with Hamas’s October 7 attack on Israel, has exacted a heavy toll. Approximately 1,200 Israelis were killed during the initial Hamas assault. Over 46,000 Palestinians, including thousands of women and children, have died in Gaza, according to local health authorities.The Israeli military claims to have eliminated 17,000 Hamas fighters. Nearly 90% of Gaza’s 2.3 million residents have been displaced. The enclave’s infrastructure lies in ruins, with hundreds of thousands living in dire conditions in coastal tent camps.","Israel and Hamas have reached a ceasefire and hostage release agreement.

Premiers meet with Trudeau in Ottawa to plan response to Trump's tariff threat

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Wednesday that while Canada hopes to avoid a trade war with the US, it is prepared to respond strongly if necessary.The Prime Minister met with provincial and territorial leaders in Ottawa on Wednesday to discuss the looming threat of US tariffs, following US President-elect Donald Trump ’s warning of a 25% tariff on all Canadian imports.Trudeau confirmed that ""nothing is off the table"" regarding retaliatory measures, but also made it clear that the burden of such actions should be shared across Canada to avoid unfairly targeting one region.The possible retaliatory measures discussed include imposing tariffs on American goods, such as steel products, glassware, and even Florida orange juice, reported AFP.Provincial leaders, including Alberta's Premier Danielle Smith, raised concerns over cutting off oil and energy exports to the US, a suggestion that was met with resistance. Smith, whose province is a major oil exporter to the US, said that Alberta would not support such a move, emphasising the need to protect the energy sector.Ontario Premier Doug Ford, on the other hand, argued for a unified response, saying, ""When Donald Trump comes at us... he's coming full tilt at Canadians as a whole."" He stressed the importance of a strong retaliatory response to send a clear message to the US.The Canadian government has also pledged nearly $1 billion for new border security measures to address concerns over illegal drug trade and human trafficking.The US-Canada trade relationship is vital.

HAVANA: Cuba started releasing some prisoners Wednesday as part of talks with the Vatican, a day after President Joe Biden's administration announced his intent to lift the US designation of the island nation as a state sponsor of terrorism.More than a dozen people who were convicted of different crimes and some of them were arrested after taking part in the historic 2021 protests, were released during the day, according to Cuban civil groups following the cases of detainees on the island.Among those freed was tattooist Reyna Yacnara Barreto Batista , 24, who was detained in the 2021 protests and convicted to four years in prison for attacks and public disorder. She was released from a prison in the province of Camaguey and told The Associated Press that eight men were also freed along with her.On Tuesday, the US government said it notified Congress about the intent to lift the designation of Cuba as part of a deal facilitated by the Vatican. Cuban authorities would release some of them before Biden's administration ends on Jan. 20, officials said.Hours later, the Cuban foreign ministry said the government informed Pope Francis it would gradually release 553 convicts as authorities explore legal and humanitarian ways to make it happen.Havana did not link the prisoners' release to the US decision on lifting the designation but said it was ""in the spirit of the Ordinary Jubilee of the year 2025 declared by His Holiness,"" referring to the Vatican's once-every-25-year tradition of a Jubilee, in which the Catholic faithful make pilgrimages to Rome.The Cuban Observatory of Human Rights, one of the civil groups, said that by 4 pm EST, 18 people had been released, including Barreto Batista.""At three in the morning they knocked,"" Barreto Batista told the AP over the phone. ""I was sleeping (in the cell) and they told me to gather all my things, that I was free.""She said that she and the eight men were warned it was not a pardon or forgiveness and that they had to be on good behavior or they could be sent back to prison.""I am at home with my mother,"" she said. ""The whole family is celebrating.""In July 2021, thousands of Cubans took to the streets to protest widespread power outages and shortages amid a severe economic crisis. The government's crackdown on the demonstrators, which included arrests and detentions, sparked international criticism, while Cuban officials blamed US sanctions and a media campaign for the unrest.In November, another Cuban nongovernmental organization, Justice 11J, said that 554 people remained in custody in connection with the protests.Biden's intention to lift the US designation of Cuba as a state sponsor of terrorism is likely to be reversed as early as next week after President-elect Donald Trump takes office and Secretary of State-designate Marco Rubio assumes the position of America's top diplomat.Rubio, whose family left Cuba in the 1950s before the communist revolution that brought Fidel Castro to power, has long been a proponent of sanctions on the communist island.","More than a dozen people who were convicted of different crimes and some of them were arrested after taking part in the historic 2021 protests, were released during the day.

But this year's list of at-risk sites goes much further afield: to the moon.""The moon seems so far outside of our scope,"" said Benedicte de Montlaur, the organisation's president and chief executive. ""But with humans venturing more and more into space, it is the right time to get ourselves organised.""Concerned that the space race could exacerbate space debris and expand tourism in orbit and beyond, the group named the moon as one of the 25 endangered sites on its 2025 World Monuments Watch. The other sites on the list, endangered by challenges like climate change, tourism, conflict and natural disasters, include Gaza, a damaged historical building in Kyiv, and eroding coastlines in Kenya and the US.With a growing number of wealthy people going to space and more govts pursuing human spaceflight, the group warns that more than 90 important sites on the moon could be harmed. In particular, researchers are worried about Tranquillity Base, the Apollo 11 landing site where astronaut Neil Armstrong first stepped onto the moon's surface.""The moon doesn't belong to anybody,"" de Montlaur said. ""It is a symbol of hope and the future."" For almost 30 years, the World Monuments Fund has received nominations for its watch list from heritage experts around the world. The list is an educational and promotional tool serving the nonprofit's other efforts to preserve cultural heritage.A division of the International Committee on Monuments and Sites devoted to aerospace heritage nominated the moon for the watch list. Gai Jorayev, president of the division, said members wanted to see sustainable management due to the ""sheer number of human artifacts on its surface.""

Unforgiving Trump says to ERS is American,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/unforgiving-trump-says-to-ers-is-american/articleshow/117273825.cms,"WASHINGTON: The three most dreaded letters in sequence in the United States are said to be IRS -- for Internal Revenue Service, the tax collecting agency that has most Americans breaking out in cold sweat every April 15, tax deadline day. Incoming US President Donald Trump on Tuesday announced he would create an EXTERNAL (itals) Revenue Service (ERS) on his first day in office ""to collect our Tariffs, Duties, and all Revenue that come from foreign sources,"" a move he believes will fill US treasury coffers and offer relief to Americans, while likely causing major trading nations to break out in sweat.""For far too long, we have relied on taxing our Great People using the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Through soft and pathetically weak Trade agreements, the American Economy has delivered growth and prosperity to the World, while taxing ourselves. It is time for that to change,"" Trump said on Tuesday, pledging to create the ERS on January 20 to ""begin charging those that make money off of us with Trade.""Canada, Mexico, and China, the three major US trading partners are first in the line of fire, followed by EU, ASEAN, Japan, and Germany, and to an extent India, Washington's 9th largest trading partner, likely to be affected. Canadian leaders have been rushing to Trump and his advisers to forestall punitive measures that could decimate the country's economy, even as India and other countries are gearing up to meet the challenge that could cause a global economic meltdown.While most analysts believe Trump's threat is a negotiating tactic to force major trading partners to reduce their tariffs and allowing import of more US products, leveling the playing field, the speed with which he is moving provides little time for negotiations. Canada, for long a benign neighbor and Washington's #1 trading partner, is already starting to crack internally, with the tariff issue causing a rift between Alberta, the country's energy-rich province, and the federal government.Over the weekend, the province's premier Danielle Smith warned that any export ban on ""Alberta oil"" -- a move contemplated by Ottawa as a counter-measure -- could spark a new national unity crisis, even as critics excoriated her for appropriating what they said is a ""Canadian resource"" for her state. Critics in British Columbia from where Canada exports lumber to the US, wondered if they could call the product ""BC lumber.""Most major American trading partners have run up a trade surplus with the US by exporting on what Trump believes are favorable terms, while keeping a lid on imports from the US to protect their domestic industry. In India's case, New Delhi shielded domestic apple growers and motorcycle manufacturers for a long time before reluctantly opening its market and reducing tariffs on US goods. In recent years, the US has ramped up its export of products ranging from apples, almonds, and chicken legs to oil, gas, and military hardware, to close the trade gap.But while India is a relatively minor problem for Washington -- despite Trump's caviling -- its biggest bugbear is China, with whom it has a trade deficit of $280 billion, almost a third of its $ 800 billion deficit with nations across the world. The imbalance is so great that the late night talk show host David Letterman once suggested Americans may as well write a check to China in April instead of paying the IRS.Trump wants to change that, jettisoning a long history of American trade munificence to lift up other countries. By threatening to impose huge tariff increases, he hopes to put a crimp on imports to the US (even if it means Americans will end up paying more for imported goods as the cost is paid by the importers and passed on to customers), fire up domestic manufacturing, and force trading partners to open their markets for more American goods -- like the American pork Washington is now hawking in India, forcing it to lift a long-standing ban stemming from concerns over ruminant feeding and trichinosis.","Incoming US President Donald Trump announced he would create an EXTERNAL (itals) Revenue Service (ERS) on his first day in office.

The Broader Context of Criticism



Shifting the Narrative



Social media has erupted with accusations of hypocrisy directed at liberals who have remained relatively silent about allegations of sexual misconduct against Neil Gaiman while continuing to vilify J.K. Rowling for her views on gender. Critics argue that Rowling has faced disproportionate backlash for her stance on biological sex, while Gaiman, a celebrated author with progressive credentials, has been met with tepid criticism despite facing serious allegations.Neil Gaiman, known for works like The Sandman and Good Omens, has been accused by two women of misconduct. Scarlett Pavlovich, a former nanny, alleged non-consensual sexual acts, while another woman, identified as ""K,"" described an exploitative and emotionally damaging relationship. The fallout has reportedly affected several of Gaiman’s high-profile projects, with Disney’s The Graveyard Book and Good Omens Season 3 on hold and his role in Netflix’s The Sandman reportedly reduced.Gaiman issued a carefully worded statement denying non-consensual activity but admitting he was ""emotionally unavailable while being sexually available"" and ""careless with people’s hearts."" He added, ""Like most of us, I’m learning and trying to do the work needed.""Social media users have pointed out the disparity in how Gaiman and Rowling are treated. Rowling has faced years of relentless backlash for her defence of women’s spaces and her belief in the reality of biological sex, while Gaiman’s progressive persona appears to have insulated him from a similar level of scrutiny.These comments underscore the frustration many feel about what they see as selective outrage within progressive circles.Gaiman’s progressive credentials, including his feminist-leaning rhetoric and support for trans activism, have likely shielded him from the same level of backlash faced by Rowling. Critics argue this discrepancy highlights a trend where liberal figures are excused for their actions if they align with the ""right"" ideological causes, while dissenters like Rowling are relentlessly targeted for their views.Accusations of hypocrisy have also been directed at the broader feminist and trans activist communities, with many questioning why safeguarding women’s rights, as championed by Rowling, is met with hostility while allegations of abuse by a celebrated male ally provoke muted responses.The backlash against Gaiman has reignited discussions about accountability in progressive spaces . While Rowling has been demonised for expressing her beliefs, Gaiman’s accusations have been met with carefully worded statements of regret and promises to ""do the work."" Critics argue that this disparity reveals a performative aspect to liberal outrage, where the focus is less on justice and more on adherence to ideological orthodoxy.The unfolding controversy around Gaiman and Rowling underscores the complexities of modern cultural discourse , where personal behaviour and ideological alignment are often judged on uneven terms.",Neil Gaiman has been accused by two women of sexual misconduct.

""I wish the incoming administration success because I want America to succeed.""

On Climate

""The existential threat of climate change has never been clearer, and our actions have never been more consequential.

Biden said that he achieved economic growth while protecting the environment and warned against a drive to undermine his record on global warming. ""We're doing both, but powerful forces want to wield their unchecked influence to eliminate the steps we've taken to tackle the climate crisis.""

""We’ve shown that we don’t have to choose between protecting the environment and growing the economy. We’re doing both, proving that sustainability and prosperity can go hand in hand.""

""The historic investments we’ve made in clean energy, electric vehicles, and renewable power are paving the way for a healthier planet and a stronger, more resilient economy.""

""The fight against climate change is not just about preserving our environment—it's about protecting our communities, creating jobs, and ensuring a better future for generations to come.""

President Joe Biden , in his farewell address on Wednesday warned that a ""dangerous concentration of power"" among the ultra-wealthy is threatening democracy in the United States, describing it as an emerging "" oligarchy .""Biden said, ""Extreme wealth, power, and influence are taking shape in America, and it literally threatens our entire democracy.""The outgoing president also expressed concern over the impact of misinformation on American society, warning that the nation is being ""buried under an avalanche of misinformation and disinformation, enabling the abuse of power"" He linked this phenomenon to a broader decline in press freedoms, which he described as ""crumbling.""Biden’s remarks came just days before Republican Donald Trump is set to assume the presidency. He urged vigilance in protecting democratic institutions and ensuring a free and independent press as pillars of the nation's stability.Biden also reflected on his administration’s achievements during his farewell, including job creation, climate action, and healthcare reforms, while cautioning against complacency in the face of rising inequality and disinformation.","President Joe Biden delivered his farewell address to the nation on Wednesday.

Short seller Hindenburg Research shuts down: Nathan Anderson,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/shook-some-empires-that-needed-shaking-short-seller-hindenburg-research-to-shut-down/articleshow/117281282.cms,"Poll What Do You Think About Hindenburg Research Shutting Down? Surprising Decision After Major Revelations A Bold Move After a History of Impactful Reports

US-based investment research firm Hindenburg Research , known for its explosive short-selling reports, is shutting down. The announcement was made by its founder, Nate Anderson , on Wednesday, marking the end of a company that shook financial empires and wiped billions off market valuations.""As I’ve shared with family, friends, and our team since late last year, I have made the decision to disband Hindenburg Research. The plan has been to wind up after we finished the pipeline of ideas we were working on. And as of the last Ponzi cases we just completed and are sharing with regulators, that day is today,"" Anderson said.""We shook some empires that we felt needed shaking,"" he said.Founded in 2017, Hindenburg Research rose to prominence for exposing alleged corporate fraud and misrepresentation. Its reports accused companies of malpractice, leading to severe market value losses.While Anderson did not cite a specific reason for the timing of the closure, he reflected on his personal journey, saying, ""There is not one specific thing—no particular threat, no health issue, and no big personal issue. I now view Hindenburg as a chapter in my life, not a central thing that defines me.""He added that the intensity of his work came at a personal cost, but he now looks forward to spending more time with his family, pursuing hobbies, and traveling.The firm’s most notable impact came in 2023 when its report against the Adani Group accused the conglomerate of ""brazen corporate fraud,"" resulting in a staggering $150 billion erosion in market capitalization. The allegations however were vehemently denied by Adani and his companies.Hindenburg also played a key role in other high-profile cases, including electric truck maker Nikola. In 2020, the firm accused Nikola of misleading investors about its technology, a claim that led to a $125 million settlement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the criminal conviction of Nikola’s founder, Trevor Milton.While Anderson plans to step away from corporate investigations, he expressed his intent to open-source Hindenburg’s methodology. ""Over the next six months, I will release a series of materials and videos to share every aspect of our model and how we conduct investigations,"" he said.As for Hindenburg’s employees, Anderson assured that he would support their next steps. ""Some are going to start their own research firms, which I will strongly and publicly encourage. Others are now free agents—feel free to reach out to me if you need brilliant, focused, and easy-to-work-with professionals.""","US-based investment research firm Hindenburg Research is shutting down.

HONOLULU: People were flocking to Hawaii Volcanoes National Park Wednesday to get a glimpse of fountaining lava.The eruption that began Dec 23 in a crater at the summit of Kilauea volcano has paused periodically. It resumed Wednesday morning as a ""small sluggish lava flow ,"" and then increased into a fountain that appear to be 200 feet (60 meters) high, the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory said.By the afternoon, visitors to the national park on the Big Island were able to see two fountains from an overlook.The observatory said it was possible fountain heights would increase as more gas-rich lava erupted.""The park is already very busy with people eager to see the eruption and we expect visitation to increase as the news gets out again,"" Jessica Ferracane, park spokesperson, said in an email.Hawaii Volcanoes National Park encompasses the summits of two of the world's most active volcanoes: Kilauea and Mauna Loa .The eruption is visible from many public overlooks in the park.

US SEC sues Musk over late disclosure of Twitter stake,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-sec-sues-musk-over-late-disclosure-of-twitter-stake/articleshow/117280961.cms,"US securities regulators sued Elon Musk in federal court in Washington on Tuesday in an enforcement action arising from his $44 billion purchase of Twitter, now called X. The lawsuit against Musk, who has become a close adviser to Prez-elect Donald Trump, is likely to be one of the more contentious final acts of the Securities and Exchange Commission under Gary Gensler, its departing chair. It could also be undercut in just a few days, when Trump appoints new leadership to take charge of the regulator.The SEC contends that in buying Twitter in 2022, Musk violated securities laws by amassing a large stock position in the social media company without filing the proper notification. The complaint said he had waited 11 days before filing the required disclosure with the SEC. The regulatory filings are required so investors in the marketplace can monitor the moves of large investors and potential takeover bids.Because Musk did not disclose his position, he was able to continue buying Twitter stock at an artificially low price, the SEC said in its lawsuit. The move ""allowed him to underpay by at least $150 million"" for the additional shares.Over the past few weeks, Musk had taunted the SEC in posts on X about the potential for filing a lawsuit. On Tuesday, his lawyer Alex Spiro denounced the regulator's latest filing. ""Today's action is an admission by the SEC that they cannot bring an actual case, because Musk has done nothing wrong and everyone sees this sham for what it is,"" Spiro said. The agency had waged a ""multiyear campaign of harassment"" against Musk but filed ""a single-count ticky-tack complaint,"" he added.","US securities regulators sue Elon Musk in federal court in Washington on Tuesday.

White House holds homeland security tabletop exercise with senior Trump officials,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/white-house-holds-homeland-security-tabletop-exercise-with-senior-trump-officials/articleshow/117280693.cms,"AP photo

Senior officials from President-elect Donald Trump's administration, including the majority of his designated Cabinet nominees, were at the White House on Wednesday to participate in a transition exercise hosted by President Joe Biden's team.The transition tabletop exercise was chaired by Homeland Security Adviser Liz Sherwood-Randall in the White House Situation Room, the White House said, and included a substantial share of Biden's outgoing Cabinet for the two-hour session. The exercise has been a key part of presidential transitions since the September 11, 2001, attacks and give the outgoing and incoming teams a chance to rehearse how to respond to and manage a range of national security crises.Wednesday's simulation touched on the management of potential terror attacks and avian flu, among other challenges.The exercises can sometimes become an eerie preview of reality. During the 2016-17 transition from then-President Barack Obama to Trump, one such exercise included a discussion of the U.S. response to a global public health event. Three years later, Trump's administration was confronted with the COVID-19 pandemic.It comes two weeks after an Islamic State-inspired attack in New Orleans on New Year's Day killed 14 people and injured more than two dozen. The country is currently managing an avian flu outbreak that has killed one person and affected the nation's food supply.Attendees included Sen. Marco Rubio, Trump's pick for secretary of state; former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, Trump's nominee for director of national intelligence; his defense secretary pick Pete Hegseth; and South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, his nominee for homeland security secretary, among others. Rep. Mike Waltz, the incoming national security adviser, and other senior White House staffers also represented the Trump team.Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, Attorney General Merrick Garland and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg were among the Biden Cabinet officials or their deputies who participated in the session, which came hours after the U.S. helped broker a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.The Biden team has been highlighting its efforts to cooperate with Trump's transition effort, including responding to hundreds of requests for information across the government on ongoing programs and sharing briefings on the top five to 10 most pressing issues at each agency. The White House separately briefed Trump's team on top issues, including global health, disaster response and artificial intelligence, that may require action in the first six months of the new administration.Wednesday's exercise follows an earlier tabletop in November with senior career government staffers to prepare to support the incoming administration.Separately, Susie Wiles, Trump's White House chief of staff was seen in the West Wing earlier Wednesday ahead of the exercise meeting with senior members of the incumbent administration.","The tabletop exercise was chaired by Homeland Security Adviser Liz Sherwood- Randall in the White House Situation Room.

""We have a deal for the hostages. They will be released shortly. Thank you!"" he wrote on his Truth Social network, before any official announcement from outgoing President Joe Biden's White House.Trump had warned Palestinian armed group Hamas of ""hell to pay"" if it did not free the captives before he took office, and envoys from both his incoming administration and Biden's outgoing one had been present at the latest negotiations. ""This EPIC ceasefire agreement could have only happened as a result of our Historic Victory in November,"" Trump added in a lengthy second post.Netanyahu's office, however, said several clauses in the framework remain unresolved, and we hope that the details will be finalised tonight. Any agreement needs to be approved by Netanyahu's cabinet.The two statement came after multiple officials said that negotiators from Israel and Hamas had agreed to a ceasefire deal to pause the devastating war in Gaza, raising the possibility of winding down the deadliest and most destructive fighting between the bitter enemies. Three officials from the United States and one from Hamas confirmed that the deal had been reached. Basem Naim, a Hamas official, confirmed the agreement, although the militant group had yet to release a formal statement.The deal, coming after weeks of painstaking negotiations in the Qatari capital, promises the release of dozens of hostages held by Hamas in phases, the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in Israel and would allow hundreds of thousands of people displaced in Gaza to return to what remains of their homes. It also would flood badly needed humanitarian aid into a territory ravaged by 15 months of war.Once official, the deal is expected to deliver an initial six-week halt to fighting that is to be accompanied by the opening of negotiations on ending the war altogether. Over six weeks, 33 of the nearly 100 hostages are to be reunited with their loved ones after months in captivity with no contact with the outside world, though it's unclear if all are alive. In exchange, Israel will release a host of jailed Palestinians.It remained unclear exactly when and how many displaced Palestinians would be able to return to what remains of their homes and whether the agreement would lead to a complete end to the war and the full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza - key Hamas demands for releasing the remaining captives. Many longer-term questions about postwar Gaza remain, including who will rule the territory or oversee the daunting task of reconstruction after a brutal conflict that has destabilized the broader Middle East and sparked worldwide protests.Hamas triggered the war with its Oct. 7, 2023, cross-border attack, which killed some 1,200 Israelis and took 250 others hostage. Israel responded with a fierce offensive that has killed over 46,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, displaced an estimated 90% of Gaza's population and sparked a humanitarian crisis.The US along with Egypt and Qatar, have brokered months of indirect talks between the bitter enemies that finally culminated in this latest deal. It comes after Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah agreed to a ceasefire in Nov, after more than a year of conflict linked to the war in the Gaza.

Former US President Barack Obama

The United States and Qatar have confirmed a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas, halting the brutal 15-month conflict in Gaza and paving the way for the release of numerous hostages. The ceasefire deal will be implemented in three phases, according to US President Joe Biden The first phase, lasting six weeks, includes a full ceasefire, withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza’s populated areas, and the release of hostages, including Americans. In return, Israel will release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners , and Palestinians can return to their neighborhoods. Phase 2 focuses on negotiating a permanent end to the war, with the release of remaining hostages and complete Israeli withdrawal, making the ceasefire permanent. Phase 3 will see the return of deceased hostages' remains and the initiation of Gaza's reconstruction.The ceasefire has garnered reactions from various world leaders, including Joe Biden, Donald Trump , and Barack Obama US President Joe Biden announced the ceasefire during a press briefing, saying, ""It's a very good afternoon because at long last, I can announce a ceasefire and a hostage deal has been reached between Israel and Hamas. More than 15 months of terror for the hostages, their families, and the Israeli people and more than 15 months of suffering by the innocent people of Gaza. Fighting in Gaza will stop and soon the hostages will return home to their families.""Biden described the negotiations as one of the toughest he has experienced, attributing the deal’s success to the pressure Israel built on Hamas with US support.""Those who have followed the negotiations can attest that the road to this deal has not been easy. I have worked in foreign policy for decades. This is one of the toughest negotiations that I have ever experienced. I have reached this point because of the pressure that Israel built on Hamas, backed by the US. The US also organized a coalition of 20 countries to stand up to attacks by the Houthis, including their missile attacks in Israel. At the G20 in Delhi in September 2023, I rallied key countries behind a vision of an economic charter from India across the Middle East to Europe that vision can now become a reality.""US President-elect Donald Trump expressed his delight at the ceasefire news on his Truth Social platform, saying, ""This EPIC ceasefire agreement could have only happened as a result of our Historic Victory in November, as it signaled to the entire World that my Administration would seek Peace and negotiate deals to ensure the safety of all Americans, and our Allies. I am thrilled American and Israeli hostages will be returning home to be reunited with their families and loved ones.""Trump added that he would leverage the Gaza ceasefire deal to further expand the Abraham Accords, US-sponsored agreements made during his first term that normalized Israel’s relations with multiple Arab nations.""We will continue promoting PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH throughout the region, as we build upon the momentum of this ceasefire to further expand the Historic Abraham Accords. This is only the beginning of great things to come for America, and indeed, the World!""The president-elect also added that his national security team, through the efforts of special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, would continue to work closely with Israel and its allies to ensure Gaza would never again become a 'terrorist safe haven.'""With this deal in place, my National Security team, through the efforts of Special Envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, will continue to work closely with Israel and our Allies to make sure Gaza NEVER again becomes a terrorist safe haven.""Former US President Barack Obama called the ceasefire deal ""good news"" for the families of the hostages taken on October 7, the Palestinian civilians who have suffered for over a year, and everyone who has prayed for an end to this conflict.""The ceasefire and hostage release deal announced between Israel and Hamas is good news – for the families of the hostages taken on October 7th, for the Palestinian civilians who have suffered for more than a year, and for everyone who has prayed for an end to this awful chapter.""Obama acknowledged that no deal can ease the pain of those who have lost loved ones or resolve the long-standing conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. ""That work will be much harder, and take much longer. But it will put a stop to the bloodshed, allow people to return to their homes, and get much-needed aid to more than a million desperate, hungry people,"" he said.The former president expressed his support for the deal, saying, ""That’s something we should all support."" He also expressed gratitude to Biden, US state of secretary Antony IsraelBlinken, and all the leaders and diplomatic teams from around the world who worked hard to achieve this agreement.","Ceasefire between Israel and Hamas will be implemented in three phases.

Michelle Obama: Michelle Obama is skipping Trump's inauguration because she is not 'phoney'.

The real reason Michelle Obama is skipping Donald Trump's inauguration and not even giving any explanation is because she is not phoney, a PageSix report citing sources said. This triggered speculation whether Michelle's dig is at her husband Barack Obama who was seen having a conversation with Donald Trump at Jimmy Carter's funeral. Michelle Obama skipped that event too and she was the only former first lady absent. It was said that she was on an extended vacation in Hawaii.But her absence from two events back to back -- both the events would have brought her face to face with Donald Trump now -- establishes that it is an intentional snub from the former first lady to Donald Trump.""While her husband appears to be playing nice with the president-elect, Michelle won’t do the same,"" Page Six reported.Without giving any excuse, the Office of Barack and Michelle Obama simply announced that Michelle “will not attend the upcoming inauguration,” in a statement to the Associated Press on Tuesday.“She’s never been fake and she’s never been phony. She’s always been very deliberate about where and how she shows up,” the source said.“She showed up reluctantly for the election. They were united, but she doesn’t have to unify around [Trump]. She doesn’t have to say anything. Her absence speaks volumes,” they added.“For years, Donald Trump did everything in his power to try to make people fear us. See, his limited, narrow view of the world made him feel threatened by the existence of two hardworking, highly successful people who happen to be black,” Michelle Obama said at the Democratic National Convention. Trump boosted the “birther movement,” the conspiracy theory that the former president wasn’t born in America, for several years leading up to his 2016 presidential run. He eventually admitted he was wrong, but did not apologize.“Why would we normalize that type of backwards leadership? Doing so only demeans and cheapens our politics,” Michelle said at the DNC. “Most of us will never be afforded the grace of failing forward. We will never benefit from the affirmative action of generational wealth. If we bankrupt a business or choke in a crisis, we don’t get a second, third or fourth chance,” she added.","Michelle Obama is not pretentious about where she wants to turn up and where not, sources said on her decision to skip Jan 20 inauguration.

India 2nd to US in 'future of work' skills: QS survey,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/india-2nd-to-us-in-future-of-work-skills-qs-survey/articleshow/117277272.cms,"NEW DELHI: Nearly a decade of effort under India's skilling mission is showing results, positioning the country as one of the most prepared job markets for future in-demand skills. The inaugural QS World Future Skills Index ranks India 27th overall, with placements in key parameters: 37th in Skills Fit, 26th in Academic Readiness, and 40th in Economic Transformation . The country ranks ranks second in the Future of Work category, trailing only the US.This index evaluated over 190 countries, over 280 million job postings, more than five million employers' skills demand, over 5,000 universities, and 17.5 million research papers, with India showing particular strength in integrating AI into its workforce. The QS analysis underscores India's readiness to adopt AI, digital, and green technologies, placing it ahead of many countries. The World Economic Forum forecasts a 60% increase in AI skills and a 35% rise in digital skills by 2030, alongside the creation of 24 million green jobs, emphasising the need for workforce adaptability.Job market maturity is often indicated by job listings in cutting-edge fields. In India, the high number of postings for AI, digital, and green skills reflects a business landscape ready for innovation. With a 59% active AI deployment rate among companies, India stands as a global leader in adopting new technologies, aligning with its 99.1 score in the Future of Work indicator.The report says, ""Despite global challenges, including a decline in venture capital (VC) funding, India remains the second-largest destination for VC in the Asia Pacific, reinforcing its robust investment ecosystem essential for innovation and future-ready job creation. The QS report also highlights the critical need for enhancements in India's higher education system, particularly in equipping graduates with the skills most demanded by employers.""Key recommendations for India include increasing tertiary education supply, adopting a modularised approach to higher education, fostering entrepreneurial mindsets, and focusing on green skills integration. Strengthening industry-academia collaboration and boosting research and development investment are pivotal to sustaining long-term growth and competitiveness.Matteo Quacquarelli, vice president, strategy and analytics at QS, said, ""India's exceptional GDP growth, developing economy, and youth population position it uniquely on the global stage. However, to sustain this growth, it is crucial to equip the workforce with relevant skills through comprehensive higher education reforms.""The report says as AI reshapes industries globally, India's proactive alignment of educational curricula with industry needs ensures it remains at the forefront of economic transformation.With sectors like renewable energy and healthcare experiencing growth, the focus on emerging technologies and sustainability is vital for India's economic resilience and workforce evolution.Quacquarelli added that between 2025 and 2030, India's economy is expected to grow at an average of 6.5% annually, putting the country ahead of many competitor economies. ""But as the economy continues to evolve, students, graduates, and workers need support to keep pace with changing skill requirements. The 2020 National Education Policy emphasised creating an adult education curriculum framework, and it's important India's higher education is fully leveraged to develop future-needed skills and competencies.""","The inaugural QS World Future Skills Index ranks India 27th overall. The country ranks second in the Future of Work category, trailing only the US. The World Economic Forum forecasts a 60% increase in AI skills and a 35% rise in digital skills by 2030, alongside the creation of 24 million green jobs.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117277273,imgsize-1349329,width-400,resizemode-4/117277273.jpg"

Donald Trump takes credit, says won't have been possible without his win



US President Joe Biden Wednesday said his administration and incoming president Donald Trump 's team are on the same team as far as negotiations on Gaza deal is concerned. Explaining the three-phase deal, Bidensaid that during the next six weeks of the first phase of the ceasefire, Israel will negotiate the necessary arrangements for phase two – “a permanent end to the war”.The US president said that there are a “number of details” to negotiate to move from the first and second phase. If negotiations take longer than six weeks, then the ceasefire will continue as long as the negotiations continue, he said. Phase two will allow for an exchange for the release of all the remaining living hostages, including male soldiers. The second phase will also involve all remaining Israeli forces to be withdrawn from Gaza, and for the temporary ceasefire to become permanent, he said. In phase three, any final remains of the hostages who have been killed would be returned to their families.On being asked about how much credit he would give to the incoming Donald Trump administration, Biden said this is the exact framework of the deal ""I proposed back in May.

It is the result not only of the extreme pressure that Hamas has been under and the changed regional equation after a ceasefire in Lebanon and weakening of Iran — but also of dogged and painstaking American diplomacy. My diplomacy never ceased in their efforts to get this done,"" Biden said in his statement.As Biden began to leave the room after the conference, a reporter called out: ““Who deserves credit for this Mr President, you or Trump?” Biden turned around and replied: “Is that a joke?”Calling the ceasefire agreement EPIC, Donald Trump said it could have been possible only as a result of his 'historic' victory in November ""as it signaled to the entire World that my Administration would seek Peace and negotiate deals to ensure the safety of all Americans, and our Allies,"" Trump posted on Truth Social.","Joe Biden said he and Donald Trump are on the same team on Israel-Hamas agreement.

Poll Do You Believe Diplomatic Talks Can Resolve Tensions Between Neighboring Countries? Depends on the Severity of the Situation Yes, They Can Help Find Peaceful Solutions

Why it matters: Pakistan’s waning influence on Taliban

This burgeoning relationship comes at a time of growing tension between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Islamabad, once a staunch ally of the Taliban, now finds itself at odds with Kabul over issues like cross-border militancy and refugee repatriation. The changing dynamics between these three players have implications for regional trade, security, and diplomacy.

Pakistan has historically maintained a stronghold over Afghanistan through its support for the Taliban, often viewed as a strategic counterweight to India. However, tensions between Islamabad and Kabul have reached a boiling point. Pakistan accuses Afghanistan of harboring militants from the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which has been responsible for escalating attacks in Pakistan.

(TTP), which has been responsible for escalating attacks in Pakistan. India’s increasing engagement with Afghanistan threatens to erode Pakistan’s strategic leverage over its neighbor. Islamabad now faces the possibility of being diplomatically isolated as Kabul looks beyond its traditional ties.

Economic implications: The decision to use Chabahar port could significantly impact Pakistan’s economy. Landlocked Afghanistan relies heavily on Pakistan for its trade routes, but the use of Chabahar provides an alternative that reduces Islamabad’s economic and strategic importance. This could further strain Pakistan’s already struggling economy, which is grappling with high inflation and a depreciating currency.

The big picture

Regional power shift: India’s growing involvement in Afghanistan represents a broader shift in regional power dynamics. By aligning itself with Kabul, New Delhi is positioning itself as a counterbalance to China and Pakistan’s influence in South Asia.

Despite not officially recognizing the Taliban government, India understands the importance of maintaining a foothold in Afghanistan. It has invested over $3 billion in development projects in Afghanistan over the last two decades, including schools, roads, and dams. Engaging with Kabul allows India to protect its past investments while also positioning itself as a key player in Afghanistan’s future development. The move also aligns with India’s broader regional strategy, which seeks to counter China’s Belt and Road Initiative and its influence in neighboring Pakistan.

Afghanistan’s balancing act

Between the lines

India’s outreach to the Taliban highlights a pragmatic shift in its foreign policy, but it also underscores the limitations of Pakistan’s influence in Afghanistan. For Islamabad, the growing proximity between Kabul and New Delhi represents a failure of its long-standing strategy of using Afghanistan as a buffer state against India.

The Taliban’s willingness to engage with India reflects its desire to reduce dependency on Pakistan while seeking new avenues for trade and development. This realignment, however, does not come without risks. By engaging with a regime criticized for human rights abuses, India risks undermining its global image as a democracy and a defender of human rights.

For Pakistan, the stakes are even higher. The loss of influence in Afghanistan not only weakens its strategic position but also complicates its efforts to address domestic security challenges. The growing isolation of Pakistan in the region could force Islamabad to rethink its approach toward both Afghanistan and India.

What’s next

India’s evolving role:

India’s quiet yet deliberate engagement with the Taliban-led government in Afghanistan is reshaping South Asia’s strategic landscape, leaving Pakistan in a precarious position.For the Taliban, engaging with India is a strategic move to demonstrate autonomy and reduce dependency on Pakistan. The Taliban’s acting foreign Mmnister Muttaqi described India as a “significant regional partner,” signaling Kabul’s intent to strengthen ties with New Delhi.By diversifying its partnerships, Afghanistan can navigate its way out of economic isolation while countering narratives that it is merely a puppet of Pakistan. This approach also provides the Taliban with an opportunity to attract aid and investments from other regional players, including Iran and China.Analysts like Maleeha Lodhi, Pakistan’s former UN ambassador, stress that Pakistan must prioritize trust-building with Afghanistan to repair strained ties and regain lost influence. However, Islamabad’s frequent border closures, airstrikes, and repatriation of Afghan refugees have created resentment, pushing the Taliban to seek alternatives.India is likely to deepen its engagement with Afghanistan through development projects, trade, and humanitarian aid. However, this involvement will remain cautious, as India balances its interests with concerns about the Taliban’s human rights record and its potential to harbor anti-India elements.The resumption of visas for Afghans, particularly for medical and educational purposes, could be a key step in strengthening people-to-people ties. This move could also enhance India’s soft power in the region, providing it with leverage in future diplomatic engagements.(With inputs from agencies)","India’s outreach to the Taliban highlights a pragmatic shift in its foreign policy.

It seems like the purpose of negotiations is merely to waste time so that public reaction over the November 26th Islamabad massacre starts to fade.""Khan called for an impartial judicial commission to investigate the incidents, particularly the November 26 event. ""Peaceful citizens were massacred on November 26th; they were directly shot at, and D-Chowk was drenched in their blood. Many of our people are still missing. In any civilized society, those responsible for such shootings would have been held accountable, but this government has not even managed to form a judicial commission yet. A judicial commission acts as a (neutral) third umpire. Only an impartial commission can provide justice to the martyrs of November 26th (2024) and May 9th (2023). If this massacre is swept under the rug, no one’s life or property in Pakistan will be safe,"" he said.He also alleged mistreatment of PTI members in custody and called for these claims to be raised internationally. ""While in military custody, our innocent people were subjected to severe mental and physical torture. According to my information, three young men attempted suicide during custody. Sami Wazir’s condition is a stark testament to this brutality. What happened to PTI leaders like Shahbaz Gill and Azam Swati is no secret. Zille Shah was brutally murdered, and Intezar Panjutha was treated worse than animals. What kind of justice is this? Those who leave PTI are absolved of any charges related to May 9th, while those who refuse are subjected to all kinds of torture and pressure,"" Khan stated.Further threatening to take the alleges injustice to global forums, the ex-Pakistan PM added, ""We haven't obtained justice despite repeatedly appealing to Pakistan’s judicial system, leaving us with no choice but to raise our voice on international forums. Pakistan’s government is bound by international laws and treaties regarding human rights. I have instructed our lawyers to take these matters to global forums and draw the world’s attention to the ongoing human rights violations in Pakistan.""In connection to the May 9 case, Imran Khan has approached the Lahore High Court for bail, according to ARY News. The case is centred around severe unrest across Pakistan following Imran Khan's arrest on May 9, 2023. Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) supporters demonstrated their outrage through widespread protests in both rural and urban areas, prompting authorities to deploy military forces in Balochistan, Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Islamabad to maintain security. During these demonstrations, PTI supporters targeted military facilities, including an assault on the Corps Commander's residence in Lahore. Subsequently, Imran Khan was named as the primary accused in the legal proceedings. The November 26 protests were also centred on similar demands with PTI members demanding release of their leader.Khan also addressed the people of Pakistan saying, ""My message to overseas Pakistanis is that democracy and human rights have been obliterated in Pakistan, to be replaced by the law of the jungle. Your boycott of foreign currency remittances is critical. Your loved ones in Pakistan deserve the same rights that you enjoy abroad.""Khan also talked about the fake allegations and cases against him while putting forward the demand for transparent investigation and justice. ""Our government was falsely accused of resettling the Taliban. Terrorism did not resurface during our tenure, and even a year after it ended. The same people who are responsible for conditions in Balochistan are also responsible for the current chaos,"" he said adding, "" No leader in Pakistan’s history has ever faced 280 cases. This kind of treatment was only meted out to Sheikh Mujibur Rahman during General Yahya's rule, and now it is being done to me.""Additionally, citing a World Bank report, Khan expressed concern about rising poverty and the impact of political instability on the economy. ""according to a recent World Bank report, an additional 13 million people have fallen below the poverty line. Every institution, including the judiciary, NAB, FIA, and police, have been tasked to work against PTI, causing political and economic systems to collapse and instability to reach its peak. Economic growth will remain zero as long as political instability persists. All of this is being done to bolster the plan for a decade-long dictatorship. Anyone who supports this lawlessness can have their corruption of billions pardoned.""According to PTI, Khan has been imprisoned for over 520 days.",Former Pakistan PM Imran Khan is currently in Adiala Jail.

ISLAMABAD: Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Malala Yousafzai will attend an international summit on girls' education hosted by her native Pakistan, where she was nearly killed by militants as a schoolgirl.Yousafzai was evacuated from the country in 2012 after being shot by the Pakistan Taliban , who were enraged by her activism, and she has returned to the country only a handful of times since.A spokesperson for the Malala Fund charity confirmed Yousafzai will appear in person at the summit, which will focus on education in Islamic nations.""I am excited to join Muslim leaders from around the world for a critical conference on girls' education,"" she said on Friday in a post on social media platform X.""On Sunday, I will speak about protecting rights for all girls to go to school, and why leaders must hold the Taliban accountable for their crimes against Afghan women & girls.""Pakistan's education minister Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui told AFP the Taliban government in Afghanistan has been invited to attend, although Islamabad has not received a response.""Nevertheless, representatives from various organisations dedicated to girls' education in Afghanistan will be participating in the event,"" he said.Afghanistan is the only country in the world where girls and women are banned from going to school and university.Since returning to power in 2021, the Taliban government there has imposed an austere version of Islamic law that the United Nations has called "" gender apartheid "".Girls are only allowed to attend primary school, while women are largely restricted to working in segregated environments in health or education.The Taliban administration claims that Islamic law ""guarantees"" the rights of Afghan men and women.- Focus on Muslim world -The two-day summit backed by the Saudi Arabia-based Muslim World League will be held in the Pakistani capital on Saturday and Sunday and opened by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.It brings together ministers, ambassadors and religious scholars from 44 countries, as well as representatives from the UN and World Bank.Tens of millions of girls are out of school in Muslim-majority countries, including Bangladesh and Nigeria.Pakistan is facing a severe education crisis with more than 26 million children out of school, mostly as a result of poverty, according to official government figures -- one of the highest rates in the world.The summit will confirm ""the shared commitment of (the) Muslim community to empower girls through education"", according to a government statement.Yousafzai became a household name after she was attacked by Pakistan Taliban militants on a school bus in the remote Swat valley.Militancy was widespread in the region at the time as the war between the Afghan Taliban and NATO forces raged across the border in Afghanistan.The Pakistan and Afghan Taliban are separate groups but share close links and similar ideologies, including a strong disbelief in educating girls.Yousafzai was evacuated to the United Kingdom and went on to become a global advocate for girls' education and, at the age of 17, the youngest Nobel Peace Prize winner.",Malala Yousafzai will attend an international summit on girls' education in Pakistan.

ISLAMABAD: State-run Pakistan International Airlines resumed direct flights to Europe on Friday following a decision by the European Union's aviation safety agency to lift a four-year ban over safety standards, officials said.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif welcomed the resumption, saying it would help improve the airline's image.The flight from Islamabad to Paris was fully booked with more than 300 passengers, the airline said.Defense Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif inaugurated the twice-a-week flights and vowed that PIA will expand its operations to other European countries soon.Asif said in a speech that the European Union Aviation Safety Agency had imposed the ban on PIA's operations to Europe because of an ""irresponsible statement"" by a former aviation minister.The curb on PIA was imposed in 2020 after 97 people died when a PIA plane crashed in Karachi in southern Pakistan. Then-Aviation Minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan said an investigation into the crash found that nearly a third of Pakistani pilots had cheated on their pilot's exams. A government probe later concluded that the crash was caused by pilot error.The ban caused a loss of nearly $150 million a year in revenue for PIA, officials say.Also Friday, the first international flight from Gwadar, a new airport in southwestern Pakistan, departed for Muscat, government officials said. The Chinese-funded airport was inaugurated by Chinese Premier Li Qiang in October.The airport, Pakistan's largest, is located in restive southwestern Balochistan province and is part of a massive investment by Beijing that links a deep seaport and airport on the Arabian Sea by road with China.","The flight from Islamabad to Paris was fully booked with more than 300 passengers, the airline said.

It has recommended reforms to ensure that the PM can face a no-confidence motion in parliament.To prevent the concentration of power in the hands of an individual or institution, it has proposed the creation of a constitutional body - national constitutional council (NCC) - to establish a system of checks and balances between the three branches of the state and the two executive positions - PM and president.This council would include the president, chief justice, PM, leaders of opposition of both houses, speakers and deputy speakers from the opposition, and a representative of other parties. The commission has recommended decentralising the judiciary by maintaining the unitary structure of Supreme Court, while establishing permanent high court benches with jurisdiction in all divisional cities.It has also provided a framework for an interim govt to be formed after the dissolution of parliament, and recommended that selection of advisers to such govts should be solely the NCC's responsibility.",The Constitution Reform Commission has recommended introducing a two-term limit on the PM's tenure.

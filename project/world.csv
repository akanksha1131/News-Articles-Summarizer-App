The New Yorker reports, citing the complaint, “At one point, Hegseth had to be restrained while drunk from joining the dancers on the stage of a Louisiana strip club, where he had brought his team.” The complaint, compiled by former CVA employees, also alleges Hegseth and his management team pursued female staffers, calling them as “party girls” and “not party girls.”The New Yorker further reports Hegseth stepped down from CVA in 2016 partly due to “concerns about his mismanagement and abuse of alcohol on the job.” The article also details financial troubles at Vets for Freedom (VFF), another group Hegseth led. It claims VFF incurred “enormous debt” under his leadership and donors ultimately reduced his role and compensation before he left in 2012.Hegseth’s attorney, Timothy Parlatore, responded to the allegations with a statement: “We’re not going to comment on outlandish claims laundered through The New Yorker by a petty and jealous disgruntled former associate of Mr. Hegseth’s.

Shared love for animals

Middleton family’s competitive spirit

Prince William has revealed a unique way to avoid the ""fiercely competitive"" atmosphere of the Middleton family's game nights, taking James Middleton 's beloved dog, Ella, for a walk.As noted in James’ book, ‘Meet Ella: The Dog Who Saved My Life’, Ella offered the Prince of Wales the perfect excuse to step away from the fast-paced card game Racing Demon.James wrote, “Ella gave him a perfect excuse to avoid the fiercely competitive atmosphere of the Middleton household, especially during our favourite fast-paced card game, Racing Demon.”Royal expert Christopher Andersen echoed this sentiment, saying that William and Kate Middleton’s card games are “intense and all-consuming,” often prompting William to look for ways to steer clear of the competitive streak that runs deep in the Middleton family.However, away from these heated games, William reportedly has no hesitation in challenging Kate in private competitions.As per RadarOnline, James Middleton shared insights on The Dog podcast, describing William’s lighthearted approach to the family games. He noted that William would often ask, “James, does Ella need a walk?” before the game even began, much to the knowing amusement of the Middleton siblings.James wrote in his memoir that William, despite his rigorous military training, was ""thrilled to be the first out of the game"" and would happily retreat to cuddle Ella once eliminated.William’s affection for animals has been a longstanding trait.According to People.com, William grew up surrounded by dogs and shared this love with his late grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, and his maternal grandmother, Frances Shand Kydd.While William hesitated to get another dog after losing a beloved pet in his youth, Kate encouraged him to welcome Lupo, a black cocker spaniel, into their family in 2011.Following Lupo’s death in 2020, the Wales family adopted another cocker spaniel, Orla, bred by James Middleton.James reflected on how William has become an integral part of the Middleton family, telling People that the Prince has been “fantastic in offering advice and support” and fully embraces his role as both a family member and future king.James added, “William has no qualms about taking part in our family traditions , even if he’s more comfortable cheering from the sidelines.”Christopher Andersen, speaking to Fox News Digital, explained that competition runs deep in royal and Middleton families alike.He noted that the late Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip enjoyed spirited contests, while King Charles III’s passion for polo often led to injuries.However, the Middleton family’s drive to win appears unmatched. James confirmed this sentiment, adding that his paternal grandmother would ""thrash"" them at Racing Demon well into her eighties.Kate, who shares her family’s love for games, also highlighted this competitive spirit in a touching September video about completing her chemotherapy. In the message, she revealed how playing card games with her family had provided moments of normalcy during her recovery.Despite the high-energy dynamic of these gatherings, William’s bond with his in-laws remains strong.As James Middleton shared with Hello! magazine, “William has been fantastic in integrating into our family, and we’re proud to have him as part of our lives.”","Prince William has revealed a unique way to avoid the ""fiercely competitive"" atmosphere of the Middleton family's game nights.

Why Joe Biden pardoned his son

White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre came under fire Monday after President Joe Biden announced pardon to his son Hunter Biden -- a move any hint of which was consistently shot down by the White House. And the press secretary, whenever asked whether Bidne would pardon his son, said no. On Monday, Jean-Pierre was asked aboard Air Force One why she persistently lied about the issue to which the press secretary reacted by saying: ""The president took an action because of how politically infected these cases were.""“The system doesn’t get corrupted by politics for people whose name is not Biden?” a reporter asked. “You’re twisting and misrepresenting what I’m saying. I’m talking about a particular issue right now,” Jean-Pierre said.“Does the president believe now and agree with President-elect Trump that the justice system has been weaponized for political purposes and that it needs root and branch reform?” another asked.“No. Read the president’s statement. Seriously, read the president’s statement. He said he believes in the Department of Justice. He does. He says it in his statement. He also believes that war politics infected the process and it led to a miscarriage of justice,” she said.In his statement, Joe Biden said he wrestled with the decision which was made over the weekend. ""I believe in the justice system, but as I have wrestled with this, I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice — and once I made this decision this weekend, there was no sense in delaying it further. I hope Americans will understand why a father and a President would come to this decision,"" Biden said.""No reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter’s cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son — and that is wrong,"" Biden said in his statement. ""There has been an effort to break Hunter — who has been five and a half years sober, even in the face of unrelenting attacks and selective prosecution. In trying to break Hunter, they’ve tried to break me — and there’s no reason to believe it will stop here. Enough is enough.""Hunter Biden was scheduled to be sentenced on December 12 for his conviction on federal gun charges. On December 16, he was to be sentenced for a separate criminal case of tax evasion.","Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, repeatedly said Joe Biden would not pardon his son Hunter Biden.

‘Totally possible’: Joe Rogan reacts to Jamie Foxx and Diddy poisoning rumours,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/totally-possible-joe-rogan-reacts-to-jamie-foxx-and-diddy-poisoning-rumours/articleshow/115907791.cms,"Joe Rogan reacts to Jamie Foxx and Diddy poisoning rumours

Rogan’s take on the allegations

Eyewitnesses share mixed accounts

Diddy responds to allegations

Joe Rogan has joined the conversation about the viral rumours linking Sean ""Diddy"" Combs to Jamie Foxx's mysterious 2023 hospitalisation.The allegations, which gained traction after Foxx reportedly joked about the Bad Boy mogul ""poisoning"" him during a taping of his Netflix special ‘What Had Happened Was’, have sparked widespread speculation.On a recent episode of The Joe Rogan Experience, Rogan and his guests—comedians Shane Gillis, Mark Normand, and Ari Shaffir, discussed the controversial claims.Citing a report by Daily Mail, Rogan remarked, “Jamie Foxx just recently said that P Diddy poisoned him, and that’s why he got that stroke.” Rogan acknowledged the wild nature of the rumour but noted that Foxx’s comments could have been comedic in nature.“It’s possible, that’s totally possible, but it’s also possible he was explaining why he went to the hospital, and he hasn’t talked about it since,” Rogan stated. He further urged caution, emphasising that the truth might only be revealed once Foxx’s special airs.The rumours initially surfaced after attendees at the Netflix special taping alleged that Foxx linked Diddy to his health scare. One such eyewitness, Big Homie CC, claimed, “I know Combs poisoned Jamie Foxx, and Jamie Foxx reported him to the FBI because of it.”Another eyewitness, videographer Choke No Joke, shared during an interview with Comedy Hype that he did not perceive Foxx’s comments as a joke.“You’ll know if he was joking when you see the show,” Choke No Joke explained, adding that as a comedian himself, he believed Foxx’s tone suggested seriousness.A source close to Diddy vehemently denied the accusations. According to TMZ, the source stated, “There is no truth to Sean Combs putting Jamie Foxx in the hospital.”Meanwhile, Foxx himself has remained coy about the matter. When approached by reporters last month, the actor deflected questions with a simple, “God bless you,” and assured fans he was feeling better.The rumour comes at a tumultuous time for Diddy, who is currently facing multiple criminal and civil charges, including allegations of sex trafficking and racketeering.As per USA Today, Diddy’s third bail request was denied, with a judge citing concerns over public safety. These allegations have added fuel to conspiracy theories surrounding the rapper's alleged involvement in Foxx’s illness.With Jamie Foxx still recovering from his health scare and his Netflix special yet to premiere, the truth behind these sensational allegations remains elusive. Whether Foxx’s comments were part of his comedic routine or a serious revelation will only become clear when the show airs.","The rumours initially surfaced after attendees at the Netflix special taping alleged that Foxx linked Diddy to his health scare.

Did Trump suggest Canada become 51st state and offer Trudeau to become its Governor?

US President-elect Donald Trump offered a shocking role to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau after the tariff threat.Recently, Trump and Trudeau met at Mar-a-Lago, the President-elect's Florida resort, where he reportedly suggested to the Canadian PM that if a tariff for failing to address trade and immigration issues would kill the neighbor to the north’s economy, maybe it should become the 51st state, according to Fox News sources.Trudeau made an unscheduled visit after Trump threatened substantial tariffs on Canadian products. The proposed 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico were linked to their alleged failure to control illegal immigration and drug trafficking into the United States.Fresh details have surfaced about their encounter, which Trump described as ""very productive.""The discussion of tariffs, border security and trade deficits dominated the agenda before the formal dinner service began.According to attendees, Trump maintained a welcoming yet direct approach whilst communicating his expectations to his Canadian counterpart.According to Fox News' sources, the president-elect told the prime minister if Canada cannot fix the border issues and trade deficit, he will levy a 25% tariff on all Canadian goods on day one when he returns to office.Trudeau told Trump he cannot levy the tariff because it would kill the Canadian economy completely. Trump replied – asking, so your country can't survive unless it's ripping off the US to the tune of $100 billion?Trump then suggested to Trudeau that Canada become the 51st state, which caused the prime minister and others to laugh nervously, sources told Fox News.He told Trudeau that if he cannot handle his list of demands without ripping the U.S. off in trade, maybe Canada should really become a state or two and Trudeau could become a governor.Despite the humorous exchanges, Trump emphasised his expectation for significant changes by January 20. The three-hour discussion covered various topics, with Canadian guests describing it as ""very friendly and very positive,"" though avoiding mention of the statehood suggestion.Both Trump's and Trudeau's offices have not responded to requests for comment from Fox News Digital regarding these statements.","US President-elect Donald Trump offered a shocking role to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau after the tariff threat.

According to officials, the restored cathedral will showcase enhanced beauty through thorough stone cleaning, artwork restoration, and furniture refurbishment or replacement.

A Delaware judge on Monday again rejected the reinstatement of Elon Musk 's $55.8 billion Tesla compensation package through a shareholder vote, maintaining her earlier ruling.Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick of Delaware's Court of Chancery ruled that Tesla's June shareholder vote attempting to ratify Musk's compensation package couldn't override her January verdict that deemed the package excessive and unfair to shareholders.McCormick found multiple flaws in Tesla's ratification attempt, including ""material misstatements"" in documents provided to shareholders about the effect of their vote.""The motion to revise is denied,"" McCormick wrote.She further noted that despite the defence team's innovative approach to ratification, their unprecedented arguments contradicted established legal precedents, AFP news agency reported.The court awarded $345 million in legal fees, considerably lower than the $5.6 billion requested by Richard Tornetta's legal team. The plaintiff is a Tesla shareholder.McCormick acknowledged the technical accuracy of their fee calculation under Delaware law, which considers the percentage of benefit achieved, but ruled that such a substantial amount would be excessive.The controversial compensation plan, initially approved by shareholders in March 2018, was specifically created to compensate the 53-year-old founder for Tesla's expansion.Tornetta's lawsuit alleged that the defendants failed their responsibilities when approving the pay plan, claiming that Musk imposed his conditions on directors who lacked sufficient independence from their chief executive.The plaintiff also claimed Musk received ""unjustified enrichment"" and sought to nullify the compensation programme that contributed to making him the world's wealthiest individual.During the 2022 trial, Musk argued that Tesla investors were among the ""most sophisticated in the world"" and capable of monitoring his management. He explained that Tesla had previously been ridiculed by the automotive industry until the Model 3's success transformed the company's fortunes.Musk maintained that he neither participated in developing the package nor discussed it with board members, including close associates, who approved it.

Cinderella effect and manosphere: New York Times cites traditional gender roles for Trump’s victory,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/cinderella-effect-and-manosphere-new-york-times-cites-traditional-gender-roles-for-trumps-victory/articleshow/115915389.cms,"The ‘ Cinderella effect ’



Trump and the ' manosphere '



Changing youth vote



Modern dating dynamics and shifting gender roles have played an important role in Donald Trump ’s victory over Kamala Harris in the 2024 US presidential election , according to a recent New York Times op-ed. The publication, written by playwright Sarah Bernstein, attributes Trump’s popularity with young men to resentment over women outpacing men in education and employment — a trend tied to cultural expectations rooted in age-old fairy tales.Bernstein points to the popular Disney princess Cinderella as a prime example of traditional narratives shaping societal expectations. In the story, Cinderella’s life improves by marrying a wealthy prince, reflecting the historical belief that a woman’s status depended on finding a successful husband. Meanwhile, the prince is valued solely for his wealth and position, reinforcing the idea that men are defined by their ability to provide and women by their ability to secure a provider.As women have advanced in education and careers, these old expectations have caused tension. Since the 1980s, women have steadily outperformed men in college enrolment and graduation. By 2022, only 42% of students in four-year colleges were men.Bernstein says this shift has left many men feeling left out, leading to the rise of the “manosphere” — an online space where podcasters and influencers promote traditional masculinity.Bernstein connects Trump’s popularity with young men to the manosphere, which she says links masculinity to financial success and supports the outdated idea of men as sole providers.“While so-called female gold diggers are an obsession of the manosphere, much of its content reinforces the male-breadwinner norm — tying money to manliness and women’s preference for providers to biology,” she wrote.Ahead of the election, Trump appeared on popular podcasts like The Joe Rogan Experience and Full Send Podcast, making direct appeals to young male voters . His efforts contrasted with Kamala Harris’s podcast appearances on shows like Call Her Daddy and Club Shay Shay. However, Harris’s team failed to secure an invitation to Rogan’s podcast, a platform widely regarded as influential among young men.The election saw a noticeable shift in the youth vote. While Democrats have historically relied on at least 60% of younger voters, early exit polls showed Harris capturing just 54% of this demographic, according to NPR.Bernstein suggests that the division between men and women in both work and relationships is worsening societal issues like loneliness and declining birth rates. “Now that women are pulling ahead, the fairy tale has become increasingly unattainable,” she wrote.In her closing argument, Bernstein urged society to challenge traditional ideas of masculinity and femininity for mutual benefit. “If we are willing to reject the manosphere’s narrow ideas of masculinity, we will find that it is possible for both men and women to thrive at the same time — in work and in love. This future is ours to create. Don’t let anyone tell you it’s a fairy tale.”","A recent New York Times op-ed attributes Donald Trump’s victory over Kamala Harris in the 2024 US presidential election to resentment over women outpacing men in education and employment.

Who is Michael Hopkins?

Michael Hopkins is a former communications director who worked for Congressman Joe Morelle, a Democrat representing New York’s 25th Congressional District.



Hopkins was responsible for managing the office’s communications strategy, including public relations and media interactions.



Morelle, a senior figure in the House, serves as the Ranking Member of the Committee on House Administration and holds significant influence in Capitol operations and workplace policies.



Before this incident, Hopkins was a trusted aide within Morelle’s team, holding a crucial position in ensuring the congressman’s messages resonated with constituents and stakeholders.



His role was particularly pivotal given Morelle’s responsibilities as a ranking member on a committee that oversees security, administration, and operations of the House of Representatives.



Hopkins’ arrest has led to swift consequences. By Monday afternoon, Morelle’s office announced that Hopkins was no longer employed, stating that the decision was made “effective immediately.”



The congressman’s office expressed its commitment to cooperating fully with the investigation and maintaining a safe and secure workplace, as highlighted by Newsweek.



The arrest comes amid heightened scrutiny of security at the Capitol, especially following a similar incident in December 2023 when another staffer was arrested for possessing ammunition and a handgun.



That episode exposed vulnerabilities in Capitol security protocols, which have since been tightened.

Michael Hopkins , a 38-year-old former communications director for Representative Joe Morelle (D-NY), was arrested on Monday morning by US Capitol Police for attempting to bring ammunition into the Cannon House Office Building.During a routine bag screening at 8.45 am (local time), officers found 11 rounds of ammunition and four magazines, one of which was a high-capacity magazine. Hopkins reportedly stated that he had forgotten the ammunition was in his bag.He now faces charges for unlawful possession of ammunition, including one count related to the high-capacity magazine, reported Newsweek.The incident has sparked renewed scrutiny of Capitol security protocols . It is the second time in three years that a congressional staffer has been arrested for possessing ammunition at the Capitol.The arrest has already led to immediate repercussions, with Representative Morelle’s office terminating Hopkins’ employment by Monday afternoon and issuing a statement reaffirming its commitment to workplace safety, according to Axios.","Michael Hopkins, a 38-year-old former communications director for Representative Joe Morelle (D-NY), was arrested on Monday morning by US Capitol Police for attempting to bring ammunition into the Cannon House Office Building.

Call for accountability

Roger Golubski , a former Kansas police detective accused of kidnapping and sexually assaulting Black women over decades, was found dead at his Edwardsville home on Monday morning, reported the news agency AP.The 71-year-old’s death, ruled a suicide by authorities, occurred hours before jury selection for his highly anticipated trial was set to begin.According to CNN, Golubski was discovered after failing to appear in court. His attorney, Christopher Joseph, stated that his client had been “despondent” over recent media coverage but declined further comment.The Kansas Bureau of Investigation confirmed there were “no indications of foul play” in his death, CBS News reported.Golubski faced six felony counts of violating women’s civil rights and had denied the allegations.Prosecutors alleged that, during his tenure with the Kansas City, Kansas Police Department, Golubski used his authority to target vulnerable women, coercing sexual favours and threatening their families.According to CNN, Court filings indicated he deliberately chose victims he believed would not be believed.The accusations against Golubski, dating back to the 1980s, have long angered the community, deepening mistrust of law enforcement in Kansas City’s poorer neighbourhoods.Many female residents feared him, claiming he preyed on their vulnerabilities and wielded his power to intimidate those who resisted. AP reported that protesters gathered outside the courthouse on Monday morning, holding signs with slogans like “Justice Now!” despite sub-freezing temperatures.These criminal charges were part of a broader investigation into Golubski’s conduct during his 35 years as a police officer. One prominent case involved Lamonte McIntyre , a teenager wrongfully convicted of a double murder in 1994.McIntyre spent over 23 years in prison before his release in 2017. The case led to a $12.5 million settlement from local officials, though Golubski denied any wrongdoing, CNN reported.Prosecutors had acknowledged the difficulty of building the case against Golubski, as much of the evidence relied on the testimonies of his accusers. Seven other women were prepared to testify against him, CBS News reported.In one particularly harrowing account, prosecutors alleged that Golubski drove a woman to a cemetery, threatened her life, and subjected her to repeated assaults beginning in her teenage years.Golubski had been under house arrest and receiving dialysis treatments prior to his death, accordind to AP. His apparent suicide has left many victims feeling that justice has been denied.Cheryl Pilate, an attorney representing some of the women, has called for an independent investigation into his death, emphasising the community’s desire for a full public accounting of his alleged crimes.The Justice Department expressed its regret that the trial could not proceed, stating, “The proceedings in this case may be over, but its lasting impact on all the individuals and families involved remains.”",Roger Golubski was found dead at his Edwardsville home on Monday morning.

Actress Nargis Fakhri 's sister Aliya has been arrested and indicted in the US on murder in the first degree and related charges for ""deliberately setting a deadly fire "" in a home's garage on Nov 2 that killed her ex-boyfriend and his female friend in the Jamaica neighbourhood of New York City's borough of Queens.According to the charges and investigation, Aliya arrived at the two-storey detached garage at about 6.20am on Nov 2 and yelled, ""You're all going to die today"" before setting the fire that turned into a ""raging inferno"" in which Edward Jacobs (35) and Anastasia Ettienne (33) died. The Queens district attorney's office said Fakhri ""allegedly set the fire near the entrance of the building, trapping the two inside with no exit"". The victims died from smoke inhalation and thermal injuries.After the actress Nargis Fakhri’s sister Aliya was arrested and indicted in New York for the murder of her ex-boyfriend and his friend, their mother told the Daily News that her daughter was incapable of such a crime. “I don’t think she would be killing someone. She was a person caring for everybody. She tried to help everybody.” The mother also revealed, according to Daily News, that her daughter was struggling with an addiction to opioids.Queens DA Melinda Katz said that Aliya Fakhri (43) “maliciously ended the lives of two people…” According to prosecutors, Anastasia Ettienne realised there was a fire and went downstairs but then returned upstairs, where Edward Jacobs was sleeping, to try and save him but perished along with him.Fakhri was indicted by a grand jury on four counts of murder in the first, four counts of murder in the second, and one count each of arson in the first degree and arson in the second degree. She faces a potential maximum of life in prison if convicted of the top charge. Aliyah Fakhri must return to court on Dec 9.Jacobs’ mother, Janet, said her son had broken up with Aliya Fakhri about a year ago but she was still trying to get back together, the New York Post reported. “Like any other person that is being rejected, he was letting her know like ‘Yo, I’m done with you. Get away from me’,” Janet was quoted as saying by New York Post. She added Aliya “wasn’t accepting the rejection”.

Jamie Lee Komoroski , a 26-year-old from South Carolina, admitted her guilt on Monday in a shocking case involving a fatal drunken driving crash that killed a bride and seriously injured the groom just hours after their wedding.She pleaded guilty to multiple charges, including felony DUI, reckless homicide, and DUI causing great bodily harm, according to WCSC.The guilty plea came at the start of Komoroski's trial, just as jury selection was about to begin. When questioned by Judge Deandra Jefferson, Komoroski confirmed her decision, stating, ""Yes, your honour,"" and waived her right to a jury trial.The tragic crash occurred on April 28, 2023, in Folly Beach, South Carolina, as newlyweds Samantha Miller , 34, and Aric Hutchinson , 36, were leaving their wedding reception in a golf-cart-style vehicle.Komoroski, reportedly driving at 65 mph in a 25 mph zone, rear-ended their vehicle. Miller died at the scene, while Hutchinson suffered multiple injuries, including broken bones and a brain injury. Two other passengers in the golf cart were also injured.Authorities revealed Komoroski's blood-alcohol content was 0.261, more than three times the legal limit, as per a toxicology report cited by CBS News.She initially claimed to police that ""something hit her"" and denied drinking, later admitting to consuming a tequila and pineapple drink and a beer. Officers noted she smelled strongly of alcohol and was driving in the opposite direction of her home. She refused field sobriety tests and was eventually compelled to provide blood samples via a warrant.Komoroski has been under house arrest since March. She faces up to 25 years in prison for her actions. The case has drawn widespread attention, with Miller's family and loved ones expressing their grief and anger in court.The tragedy has also led to a $1.3 million settlement in a wrongful death lawsuit filed by Hutchinson, which named Komoroski, Enterprise Rent-A-Car, and several bars that served her alcohol on the day of the crash. Many establishments settled out of court.According to ABC11, Miller’s parents and sister shared emotional victim impact statements during the hearing, leaving Komoroski in tears. Hutchinson, who spoke to Good Morning America shortly after the incident, recalled his wife's last words, ""The last thing I remember her saying was she wanted the night to never end.""Komoroski's sentencing is expected to be finalised soon, bringing a measure of closure to a case that has left a devastating mark on all involved.","Jamie Lee Komoroski, 26, pleaded guilty to felony DUI, reckless homicide, and DUI causing great bodily harm.

Pete Hegseth: When drunk Pete Hegseth shouted 'kill all Muslims' at a bar on official tour,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/when-drunk-pete-hegseth-shouted-kill-all-muslims-at-a-bar-on-official-tour/articleshow/115910893.cms,"Fresh allegations of alcohol abuse, drunken ruckus emerged against Pete Hegseth.

Donald Trump's nomination for defense secretary, former Fox News host Pete Hegseth once yelled at a bar ' kill all Muslims ' in a drunken state. Two non-profit advocacy groups -- Veterans for Freedom and Concerned Veterans for America -- both led by Hegseth have the recording apart from other evidence of financial mismanagement and inappropriate sexual advances. New Yorker reported that Hegseth had to step down from both organizations. Reacting to the fresh claims, Hegseth's lawyers said these outlandish claims must have come from a ""petty and jealous disgruntled former associate"".Hegseth has already been accused of a sexual assault incident that took place in 2017 but Hegseth said the incident was consensual. But since he was blackmailed during the Me Too movement, he had to pay the woman.New Yorker cited a previously undisclosed whistleblower report on Hegseth's tenure as the president of Concerned Veterans for America that said Hegseth was found intoxicated while acting in his official capacity and sometimes he needed to be carried out of the organization's events.At one such event, Hegseth had to be restrained from joining the dancers on the stage of a Louisiana strip club. Hegseth and some other members of his management team divided the female staff into two groups: the ""party girls"" and the ""not party girls"".In 2015, at a bar, Hegseth drunkenly chanted 'kill all Muslims"" during the early hours.In January 2016, Hegseth resigned from Concerned Veterans for America under pressure. He had no other jobs at that time. On his silent departure, he said, ""Sometimes it just makes sense to make a transition."" But the New Yorker cited sources who claimed he was made to resign because of his mismanagement and alcohol abuse.“I’ve seen him drunk so many times. I’ve seen him dragged away not a few times but multiple times. To have him at the Pentagon would be scary,” one person who claimed to have contributed to the whistleblower report told New Yorker.","Former Fox News host Pete Hegseth is Donald Trump's nomination for defense secretary.

PESHAWAR: The death toll from sectarian violence in Pakistan's restive Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province surged to 130, with at least six people killed and eight injured on Sunday, as clashes in the volatile Kurram district continued for the eleventh consecutive day.The clashes between Alizai and Bagan tribes in the district started on November 22, after an attack on a convoy of passenger vans near Parachinar in which 47 people were killed a day earlier. Several passengers who had sustained grave injuries succumbed later, raising the toll in the convoy killing to 57.Police said the situation remained tense, and violence persists despite a recent ceasefire agreement between the Sunni and Shia groups.The six new deaths reported on Sunday brought the death toll to 130, while the total number of injured rose to 186 after eight fresh injuries were reported.The 10-day truce brokered last week has been rendered ineffective by intermittent violence, which shows no signs of abating.A high-powered delegation, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Secretary Nadeem Aslam Chaudhry and IGP Akhtar Hayat Gandapur, had also negotiated a ceasefire last weekend, but violence resumed shortly afterwards.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi earlier planned to dispatch members of the grandpeace jirga (council of tribal leaders) from Kohat division to Kurram for engaging with leaders from both warring factions to negotiate peace.Addressing a gathering of political leaders and tribal elders in Kohat on Sunday, he called for strict action with public cooperation to make the region weapon-free through joint operations.He said he was ready to go to Kurram and stay there for as many days as the jirga suggested to ensure peace in the region.""No other country or province will resolve our issues. We must take responsibility for improving the situation ourselves,"" he said.Kundi announced an All-Parties Conference (APC) for peace and the province's rights and invited Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur to join it.The governor stressed the role of religious scholars in promoting peace, urging them to focus on unity.Several other leaders addressed the gathering, putting aside their ideological differences on other issues.The continued violence forced the closure of the main Peshawar-Parachinar Road for travel, and commuting at the Pak-Afghan Kharlachi border has also been suspended.The closure of the main arteries has created a scarcity of oil, food commodities and medicines in the region.The Kurram region is also experiencing a communication blackout, with mobile and internet services suspended and educational institutions closed.Police and other security forces personnel had been deployed in various parts of Lower Kurram, said Deputy Commissioner Javed Ullah Mehsud, adding that all-out efforts will be made for a truce in other areas today as well.""We are hopeful for progress on a ceasefire and reopening of transport routes,"" he stated.Previous efforts to mediate peace, including a seven-day truce brokered by provincial officials in November have failed to hold.","Death toll from sectarian violence in Pakistan's restive Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province surges to 130.

BALOCHISTAN: At least 10 Baloch men have been reportedly forcibly disappeared by Pakistforces in separate incidents in Jiwani, Uthal, Turbat, and Karachi areas of Pakistan .

The classmates of missing students have identified them as Gulab, Balaach, Bayan, and Nasir. Speaking to local media, one of their classmate said, ""They were taken while at the bazaar, and we haven't heard anything from them since.""In Jiwani, security forces are reported to have apprehended three men Faqeer Muhammad, his son Dad Muhammad, and another individual named Daarjan. Their current whereabouts remain unknown, The Balochistan Post reported.On Friday morning, two more individuals were taken from the Askani area of Turbat. They have been identified as Waris, son of Saleem, and Nisar, son of Aslam. They were taken to an unknown location.In Karachi, a rickshaw driver named Sadiq Ahmed, son of Dilmurad, and a resident of Kan Gichk, was reportedly arrested in the Lea Market area. His whereabouts are also unknown.During this series of disappearances, one individual, Sheyak, son of Allah Bakhsh, who was abducted in Gwadar on November 22, has since returned home.Human rights activists and advocacy organizations have expressed grave concern over the escalating cases of enforced disappearances in Balochistan. Recent operations have allegedly resulted in the forced disappearance of more than 50 people from areas such as Turbat, Dera Bugti, Sui, Barkhan, and Kalat.Among those recently subjected to enforced disappearances are Dr Zafar (son of Mohammad Rahim), Rahim Jan (son of Dr Zafar), Dr Mohammad Kareem (son of Bahram), Dangla (son of Haji Moj Bugti), Pir Mohammad (son of Pano Bugti), Ismail (son of Lalu Bugti), and Rashid Ahmad Khetran (son of Master Gul Mohammad Jan Bughio).In a recent military operation in Kalat, more than 40 people were reportedly arrested.

The Baloch nation is enduring the worst forms of oppression. With each passing day, disturbing reports of extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances emerge. Hundreds of innocent individuals and their families are subjected to this cruel practice, and in many cases, these victims are executed.""The statement further condemned the silence of human rights organizations and the media, highlighting that the genocide of the Baloch people is intensifying while the world remains indifferent. The lives of the Baloch people hold no significance to anyone. State violence has reached its peak.In the statement posted on X, BYC stated, ""Today alone, eight Baloch individuals were forcibly disappeared from a single household, leaving behind no male member, including an elderly person, Dr. Zafar, and his son, Raheem Baloch. Additionally, five of Dr. Zafar's guests were abducted from his house. While Dr. Zafar was later released after severe humiliation and torture, the others remain forcibly disappeared.""The BYC expressed its grave concern, emphasizing that despite their peaceful efforts, the genocide they are resisting is rapidly intensifying.Vowing to continue its resistance movement, the BYC stated, ""We can never, and will never, remain indifferent while our people endure such brutality. BYC will continue to strengthen and expand the resistance movement against the ongoing Baloch genocide.""",At least 10 Baloch men have been reportedly forcibly disappeared by Pakistforces in separate incidents.

Clavicular says fear drove his actions after viral Cybertruck livestream





A chaotic livestream involving controversial streamer Clavicular has ignited widespread debate online, raising serious questions about self-defense, accountability, and the increasingly blurry line between content creation and real-world danger. Footage circulating from Christmas Eve appears to show the influencer driving his Tesla Cybertruck forward while a person was on the hood, triggering immediate backlash across social media.As clips spread rapidly, viewers were left questioning whether the moment was a reckless stunt, a panicked reaction, or something far more serious, especially as platforms and fellow streamers responded in real time.According to videos shared online, the incident unfolded during a livestream when several individuals allegedly surrounded Clavicular’s vehicle. Moments later, the Cybertruck can be seen moving forward as someone appears to fall beneath it. In subsequent footage, Clavicular is heard explaining his state of mind to a person in a reflective jacket, insisting fear drove his actions.“You saw that?” he said. “Bro, they were surrounding our car. Yeah, exactly, I can't see shit. Well, that's why… when you're afraid… well, I don't know what's going on.”He also claimed he believed at least one person was armed, alleging he noticed what looked like a pistol imprint under clothing, an assertion that has not been independently verified.The controversy intensified after fellow streamer Adin Ross reportedly contacted Clavicular, advising him to continue recording while avoiding public statements. “You need to be live for this. Okay? You need to be recording something,” Ross said, later urging him not to answer questions and to document events elsewhere.Soon after, Clavicular’s Kick channel became inaccessible, fueling speculation of a platform ban, though no official explanation has been released. The incident adds to a growing list of controversies surrounding the streamer, whose past stunts, from inflammatory commentary to medically questionable behavior, have already drawn criticism.As authorities and platforms remain silent, the situation highlights a larger issue: when livestreamed chaos turns dangerous, the consequences don’t end when the camera cuts.Also Read: Kick bans streamer Braden “Clavicular” after shocking Tesla Cybertruck incident caught on live stream where he allegedly “killed” a man","Clavicular claims fear drove his actions, alleging he believed individuals surrounding his vehicle were armed.

Candace Owens argues grief does not exempt leadership from scrutiny







In the weeks following Charlie Kirk’s assassination, fault lines inside the conservative movement have widened, and few voices have amplified that tension more than Candace Owens. The commentator has now turned her attention squarely toward Erika Kirk, challenging how the Turning Point USA figurehead has handled public scrutiny, internal dissent, and mounting conspiracy claims.What began as sympathy for a grieving widow has evolved into a broader argument about accountability, transparency, and leadership during moments of crisis. Owens’ remarks have sparked intense debate online, forcing conservatives to confront uncomfortable questions about power, responsibility, and credibility.Owens has said she agrees, in principle, that burial arrangements and family mourning should remain private. “I think that when people are being buried and where they're being buried and how their funerals are done, that is very private matter,” she acknowledged.But she drew a sharp line between privacy and selective engagement, accusing Erika of what she called “Meghan Markle syndrome ... where you want privacy when you want it, but you want publicity whenever you want it, and that just doesn't work.”The controversy extends beyond personal boundaries. Owens expressed frustration that Erika claimed she lacked time to address conspiracy theories while continuing public appearances. “She has time,” Owens said. “It is just what she means to say: not her priority.”Erika, for her part, has defended her stance, stating, “Call me names, I don’t care. ... But when you go after my family, my Turning Point USA family, my [The] Charlie Kirk Show family… no.” She also emphasized her focus on accountability, saying, “I want justice for my husband.”Owens closed with a broader critique that ignited backlash: “this is why there are many people who do not believe that women are equipped to lead companies,” arguing the response she observed was “an unbelievably emotional response that is absent of any logic.”The exchange has become more than a personal feud, it now represents a defining moment for Turning Point USA and the movement surrounding it.Also Read: “She’s a sociopath”: Candace Owens faces growing credibility backlash as critics question missing Egyptian planes evidence","Candace Owens argues grief does not exempt leadership from scrutiny.

What the poll reveals about Trump and Powell



Trump trails despite strong Republican support



A long-running clash



Rates, policy and public moments





Jerome Powell has emerged as the most popular figure among senior US leaders, according to a new national survey. The finding places him ahead of President Donald Trump , whose approval rating remains near historic lows.The results come from a Gallup national poll conducted in early December 2025. The survey was carried out between December 1 and 15 and included roughly 1,000 US adults. It measured job approval for 13 major political and institutional figures.Gallup found that Powell holds a 44% job-approval rating, the highest of any figure tested in the survey. Trump’s approval rating stood at 36%, which Gallup described as a new low for his second term and only slightly above his all-time low of 34% recorded in 2021.Only two figures crossed the 40% threshold. Powell ranked first, followed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who registered a 41% approval rating. All other leaders included in the poll remained below that level.The survey shows that Trump’s approval remains sharply polarised along partisan lines. About 89% of Republicans approve of his performance, while support among independents is far lower and approval among Democrats is near zero.This divide continues to pull the president’s overall rating into the mid-30s.Powell’s numbers also reflect partisan division. While his 44% approval does not represent majority support, it remains the strongest net rating among all the figures tested in the poll.The result is notable given Trump’s repeated and public attacks on Powell throughout 2025. The president has criticised the Fed chair over interest-rate policy, called him a “loser,” and pressed the central bank to cut rates more aggressively to support economic growth.Trump has also suggested that Powell should resign and has openly weighed replacing him when his term as Fed chair ends in May 2026, despite having nominated Powell to the position during his first term.The Federal Reserve has cut interest rates three times this year as it seeks to support a slowing economy. The most recent cut, announced in December, lowered the benchmark rate by 0.25 percentage points to a target range of 3.5% to 3.75%.Tensions between the two men have also played out publicly. In July, Powell corrected Trump during a visit to the Federal Reserve after the president misstated renovation costs at the Fed’s headquarters, an exchange that drew widespread attention.Gallup noted that no leader in the survey approached 50% approval, highlighting a broader mood of dissatisfaction with national leadership. The poll measures job approval rather than personal favourability or voting intent and reflects deep partisan divides across nearly all figures tested.","Gallup found that Powell holds a 44% job-approval rating, the highest of any figure tested in the survey.

The Silver Lake Nursing Home, the site of a devastating explosion on Tuesday, had an overall rating of one star on Medicare’s federal Care Compare system, indicating its health inspections are considered “much below average. ”The rating has raised questions about the facility’s safety and care standards, especially following the blast, which trapped many residents under debris. The explosion is suspected to have been caused by a gas leak, and numerous rescue teams were on site to assist.The Medicare star system evaluates nursing homes across three categories: health inspections, staffing, and quality measures. Silver Lake scores particularly poorly in health inspections, receiving only one star. Inspectors found multiple deficiencies in care and compliance with state and federal standards.The most recent health inspection in the nursing home took place in September 2024. The facility passed fire safety and emergency preparedness checks, the low inspection score suggests there were significant issues in resident care, medication management, or overall safety compliance. The poor ranking indicates that Silver Lake performs far below the national average for nursing homes of similar size and scope.Medicare’s five-star system is designed to help families and caregivers compare facilities when making decisions about care. A one-star rating, particularly in health inspections, signals potential risks to residents and areas in urgent need of improvement. The rating does not capture every aspect of care, but it shows significant concerns about regulatory compliance and day-to-day operations.The importance of rating comes into play after the nursing home suffered a major explosion, which trapped residents and forced emergency crews to conduct large-scale evacuations.

Safety warning

Winter hits hard





The UAE is trading its sunny blue skies for a more atmospheric winter vibe this week.According to the National Centre of Meteorology (NCM), a weak extension of a low-pressure system is sweeping across the country from December 25 to December 29.This shift means residents can look forward to generally pleasant and moderate daytime temperatures, while the nights will take on a noticeably crisper, cooler edge.The National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) forecasts generally pleasant and moderate weather across the UAE from Thursday, Dec 25 through Monday, Dec 29. Temperatures will remain mild during the day and dip slightly at night, typical for the start of winter, as a weak low-pressure extension moves over the region.Expect scattered precipitation throughout the weekend. The NCM predicts that rainfall will be intermittent and vary in intensity, mostly appearing as light to moderate showers.Authorities are urging extra caution for commuters and mariners due to two major environmental hazards. High humidity levels will peak during the late night and early morning hours. This will likely result in thick mist and fog over inland and western areas.Drivers are advised to reduce speeds and closely follow police instructions on major highways.Sea conditions in the Arabian Gulf and the Sea of Oman will remain manageable until Saturday. However, by Sunday, fresh northwesterly winds will cause the sea to become rough. Mariners and beachgoers should avoid deep-sea activities as the wind speeds increase.The UAE is currently experiencing its coldest week of the season. A weather station at Jebel Jais in Ras Al Khaimah recorded a bone-chilling 3.5°C at midnight recently, the lowest temperature of the year.As the rain clouds move in, daytime temperatures across the country will remain moderate, but nighttime temperatures will continue to dip significantly, especially in the desert and mountainous regions.

From civil rights to clickbait: Dave Chappelle’s take on Charlie Kirk comparison with Martin Luther King Jr,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/from-civil-rights-to-clickbait-dave-chappelles-take-on-charlie-kirk-comparison-with-martin-luther-king-jr/articleshow/126150455.cms,"Charlie Kirk's KILLER In Court; Tyler Robinson Defiant, Shows No Remorse | Dramatic Scenes On Cam





Comedian Dave Chappelle has forcefully rejected a comparison between conservative commentator Charlie Kirk and civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr, calling the idea exaggerated and fundamentally misguided.In a clip circulating widely on social media, Chappelle responded to claims that Kirk represents a modern equivalent of Dr King. His verdict was blunt, arguing that the comparison stretches credibility far beyond breaking point.Chappelle dismissed the analogy almost immediately, saying that while both figures are well known, the similarities effectively end there. He acknowledged that both men have faced violence, but stressed that shared notoriety or controversy does not place them on the same moral or historical footing.According to Chappelle, equating a digital-era political influencer with a leader of a mass civil rights movement misunderstands what made Dr King significant. “That’s a reach,” he said, a phrase commonly used to describe an argument that is forced or unsupported by reality.At the heart of Chappelle’s critique was the difference between activism shaped by history and activism shaped by algorithms. He described Kirk primarily as an internet personality whose influence depends on provoking reactions and driving engagement online.Chappelle argued that modern online figures often rely on controversy to remain visible, because outrage fuels clicks, views and shares. That dynamic, he suggested, is fundamentally incompatible with the kind of leadership embodied by Dr King, whose work was rooted in grassroots organising, moral persuasion and sustained collective action.To underline the contrast, Chappelle jokingly imagined Dr King adopting the language of modern content creators, urging audiences to “subscribe” or “change my mind”, a comparison that drew laughter while reinforcing his point about the absurdity of the analogy.ID@undefinedCaption not available.The episode highlights a broader cultural tension over how historical legacies are invoked in today’s political debates. As social media blurs the line between activism, commentary and entertainment, comparisons to figures such as Martin Luther King Jr increasingly provoke backlash.For Chappelle, the line remains clear. Moral leadership forged in the struggle for civil rights, he suggests, cannot be reduced to viral moments or engagement metrics. In his view, moving “from civil rights to clickbait” is precisely where such comparisons go wrong.",Comedian Dave Chappelle has forcefully rejected a comparison between conservative commentator Charlie Kirk and civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr. He described Kirk primarily as an internet personality whose influence depends on provoking reactions and driving engagement online.

Why was the licence revoked?

What does this mean for you?

Knowing that the CBUAE is actively monitoring and ""pruning"" the market of non-compliant players means you can have higher confidence in the remaining licensed exchange houses.

These regulations are designed to prevent scams, fraud, and the misuse of financial platforms. A cleaner system means fewer risks for your personal hard-earned money.

By enforcing these rules, the UAE remains a globally respected financial hub. This keeps exchange rates competitive and ensures that international banks continue to work smoothly with UAE-based institutions.





The Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE) has taken decisive action against Omda Exchange, revoking its licence and striking the company’s name off the official register of licensed entities. The regulator also imposed a financial penalty of Dh10 million on the foreign exchange firm. This enforcement follows supervisory examinations that uncovered multiple breaches of UAE banking laws and regulations.The move was carried out under the Decretal Federal Law on the Central Bank and the Organisation of Financial Institutions and Activities, which gives the CBUAE the authority to regulate, supervise, and enforce compliance across financial institutions operating in the country.According to official statements and regulatory findings, the CBUAE’s examinations revealed that Omda Exchange failed to comply with core legal and regulatory requirements. While specific details of each breach have not been fully disclosed publicly, the Central Bank’s action fits a broader pattern of strict enforcement against exchange houses that fall short of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and other compliance standards.The move underscores the bank’s mandate to ensure that financial service providers adhere to legal obligations and internal controls that safeguard the integrity of financial transactions in the UAE.You might wonder how a corporate fine affects the average resident sending money home. The impact is actually very positive for the ""common man."" When the Central Bank takes such strict action, it is working to ensure that every dirham you hand over at a counter is safe.This latest enforcement is part of a broader, ongoing trend. In recent months, we have seen the CBUAE impose various fines—ranging from Dh2 million to over Dh100 million, on different financial entities.

Epstein files out: Trump referenced in some newly released docs; DOJ calls claims 'untrue',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-accused-of-rape-in-newly-released-epstein-files-doj-calls-claims-untrue-and-sensationalist/articleshow/126148145.cms,"DOJ Epstein BOMBSHELL: Trump Did This On Jet With ‘Bestie’ & A Woman... | 11k More Files Released





The US Justice Department released nearly 30,000 additional pages of documents linked to Jeffrey Epstein, marking the largest disclosure yet in the long-running investigation into the late financier and convicted sex offender. The files also contained many of mentions of US President Donald Trump, although it includes an email from a prosecutor pointing out the flights that Trump took on Epstein’s private jet during the 1990s.The Department of Justice said that some material includes “untrue and sensationalist claims” about Trump that were submitted to the FBI shortly before the 2020 election. The department said those allegations were unfounded and false, but the records were being made public in the interests of legal transparency, with protections in place for Epstein’s victims.Among nearly 30,000 pages of material is now available on the official Justice Department website.An FBI intake report dated October 27, 2020, records a tip from a former limousine driver. According to that report, the driver described a disturbing phone conversation he claimed he overheard in 1995 involving Trump and Epstein.The driver’s account says the woman later told him she had contacted police about what had occurred, and was then found dead in January 2000 by suicide.The details in the file are heavily redacted, and the authorities have made little to no determination about the allegations’ credibility.In an accompanying statement on X on Tuesday, DOJ addressed the claims. It said some documents contain “untrue and sensationalist claims made against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election.""The authotrity described the allegations as lacking any credible basis. “To be clear: the claims are unfounded and false, and if they had a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponised against President Trump already,” the department said.The DOJ reitarated its commitment to transparency and the legal requirement to release the records, but also said that the inclusion of such claims in the files does not make them factual.Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein. In public statements this week, the MAGA chief called the focus on the Epstein case as a distraction by Democrats, asserting that he “cut ties” with Epstein long before the pedophile's arrest in 2019.The release covers a range of material, not just the unverified rape allegation. Internal emails in the files show Trump was recorded as having travelled on Epstein’s private jet in the 1990s more times than previously known — at least eight flights between 1993 and 1996.Trump’s association with Epstein in the 1990s is well documented, but inclusion in flight logs or social records is not itself an accusation of illegal behaviour.DOJ is constantly being pressured by Democrats for not releasing the full bulk of files. Supporters of the Transparency Act say the public has a right to see government records, even if they contain unverified claims.The latest release follows criticism of an earlier batch of Epstein records, some of which were temporarily removed from the DOJ’s online portal amid concerns about protecting victims’ identities. Authorities later restored those files after determining no victims were shown in the disputed photos.","Department of Justice released nearly 30,000 additional pages of documents linked to Jeffrey Epstein.

More than medicine: How a weight-loss drug helped US envoy free prisoners in Belarus,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/more-than-medicine-how-a-weight-loss-drug-helped-us-envoy-free-prisoners-in-belarus/articleshow/126179028.cms,"



Diplomacy rarely hinges on small talk, but in an unusual backchannel between Washington and Minsk, a casual exchange about weight loss became part of a negotiation that helped secure the release of political prisoners in Belarus. The episode centres on John P. Coale, a senior US envoy with close ties to President Donald Trump, and Belarus’s long-serving leader Alexander Lukashenko, a figure widely criticised for authoritarian rule.According to reporting by The Wall Street Journal, the moment unfolded during a dinner where formalities gave way to personal conversation. Lukashenko remarked on Coale’s slimmer appearance and asked whether he had lost weight. Coale said he had, crediting a prescription weight-loss drug, Zepbound, and even shared a brochure from its manufacturer, Eli Lilly. What could have passed as a throwaway comment instead helped loosen a discussion otherwise dominated by sanctions, prisoner lists and political demands.At the time, Belarus was seeking relief from US economic pressure. Lukashenko wanted sanctions eased on key industries and assistance with repairs to his presidential aircraft, which had been delayed by restrictions on parts and servicing.In return, he signalled a willingness to release detainees, a lever his government has long used during periods of diplomatic thaw. Coale later described the approach as distinctly Trumpian: less concerned with optics and more focused on outcomes.The results were tangible. Lukashenko’s government released 123 prisoners in one tranche, including Nobel Peace Prize laureate Ales Bialiatski and opposition figure Maria Kalesnikava. Since Trump’s return to office, Belarus has freed more than 250 detainees from over ten countries, among them at least five American citizens. For families who had spent years campaigning for their relatives’ release, the method mattered less than the fact that the prison doors opened.In parallel, Washington eased certain restrictions. Sanctions were lifted on potash, a major Belarusian export central to global fertiliser markets. The US approved software updates and spare parts from Boeing for the state airline Belavia and signalled support for long-delayed repairs to Lukashenko’s jet. US officials also discussed the possibility of arranging access to Zepbound for the Belarusian leader, a detail that underscored just how personal the channel had become.The story has endured not because a drug bought anyone’s release, but because it illustrates a broader truth about how influence can work. Rapport, personality and the unexpected can matter as much as policy papers. In this case, a conversation about weight loss helped soften the ground for an agreement that returned prisoners to their families. It is a reminder that international politics often turns on human moments, and that sometimes the path to freedom begins in the most unlikely places, over dinner, with a simple question and an honest answer.","The episode centres on John P.

Right-wing activist Laura Loomer has reacted to the killing of Dipu Chandra Das, a 26-year-old Hindu factory worker in Bangladesh. She used the incident to warn about the spread of the Islamist hatred. Her comments followed after Das was lynched by a mob following unverified accusations of blasphemy linked to a workplace dispute.In a post on X, Laura Loomer urged followers to “say his name” and framed the killing as part of what she described as a broader pattern of religiously motivated violence. She argued that Islamist ideology fuels hatred against religious minorities and claimed that such ideas are increasingly being normalised in public discourse.Loomer warned that similar sentiments could spread beyond South Asia and reach Western countries if lawmakers and political leaders fail to confront the issue. Her remarks also criticised prominent media figures, including Tucker Carlson, whom she accused of enabling or downplaying what she sees as the influence of Islamist narratives.Dipu Das was attacked on 20 December in the Bhaluka area of Bangladesh’s Mymensingh district.He was beaten by a group of people after a co-worker accused him of making remarks offensive to Islam, an allegation that has not been substantiated by any court or official investigation.Das, who worked at a garment factory, was the sole breadwinner for his family, which includes his parents, wife, and child. Graphic footage of the attack, filmed by bystanders, spread widely online and triggered outrage among members of the global Hindu community.The killing has renewed attention on the situation of religious minorities in Bangladesh following political upheaval after the removal of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina in 2024.Bangladesh’s current leadership under Muhammad Yunus has faced criticism over its response to attacks on Hindus in the country.

US visa holders face new uncertainty as ‘prudential’ revocations spike; anxiety looms large across Indian diaspora,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-visa-holders-face-new-uncertainty-as-prudential-revocations-spike-anxiety-looms-large-across-indian-diaspora/articleshow/126175668.cms,"Representational photo





US immigration enforcement is getting tougher, with a spike in ‘prudential’ visa revocations, especially over the past several weeks being reported; these revocations are transforming a once-technical measure into a high-stakes risk for students, skilled workers, and their family members.Rajiv S Khanna, managing attorney at Immigration.com, said his firm has seen a marked rise in revocation notices issued by the US Department of State (DOS), often delivered abruptly by email. The impact is felt most acutely by F-1 students and H-1B workers.The change in tone is a cause for worry. Earlier notices typically clarified that while the visa stamp was revoked, the individual could continue to stay in the US in valid status and would only need a new visa if they travelled abroad. “The practical impact was limited and inconvenient, but manageable. If you didn’t travel, life went on,” said KhannaAccording to Khanna, recent notices explicitly state that cases are being reported to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). “This is a fundamentally different situation and is a potential pathway to removal proceedings,” he said.Given the large presence of Indian students and professionals in the US, anxiety within the diaspora is palpable. The prudential revocations are often justified on broad, vaguely worded grounds, most commonly citing ‘driving under influence’ (DUI) arrests or other encounters with law enforcement.Abhinav Tripathi, immigration attorney and founder of Protego Law Group, said the trend reflects a deeper shift in how information is being used.“These revocations are less about a single type of misconduct and more about how information is being re-evaluated,” he says. According to Tripathi, older arrests without convictions, prior immigration history, and data resurfacing through expanded inter-agency sharing and social-media review are increasingly triggering action. “Much of the conduct being scrutinised is not new. In many cases, it predates the current visa by years.”Ashwin Sharma, an immigration attorney, frames the change as part of a broader move towards continuous vetting. He notes that while a narrow five-year lookback applies in specific DUI-related consular scenarios, the State Department’s visa office continuously monitors millions of records drawn from criminal and intelligence databases that do not expire. “If a derogatory hit surfaces from an older arrest, the department has the authority to revoke the visa regardless of when the incident occurred,” said Sharma.“While the standard DS-160 visa application asks for social media handles and history for the past five years, as does the ‘extreme vetting’ form (DS-5535). But the latter also asks for travel and employment history going back 15 years. Furthermore, a release issued by DOS in June - Announcement of expanded screening and vetting for visa applicants instructs officers to review an applicant's entire online presence for ‘hostility’ or ‘evasiveness,’ which to me suggests the scrutiny is not limited to a fixed timeframe,” he explained.For affected individuals who are in the US, a prudential revocation typically does not cancel lawful status or work authorisation by itself. “From a legal standpoint, this is best understood as a travel and re-entry problem, not an immediate status problem,” Tripathi explained.The real risk is triggered the moment a person leaves the country, as re-entry would require a fresh visa application, which almost inevitably draws heightened scrutiny and typically a bleak chance of approval. “However, with DOS now reporting these cases to ICE, visa holders may face removal proceedings initiated by ICE even while they remain in the US,” said Khanna.Judicial options are virtually non-existent due to the doctrine of consular non-reviewability. Sharma says practical options are limited to requesting post reconsideration or correction in cases that are clearly erroneous; submitting a LegalNet inquiry when there is a strong procedural or legal issue; filing requests under the Freedom of Information Act to understand what is in the records, where possible, and lastly reapplying for a new visa with a strategy built around overcoming the suspected trigger.Given the trend, Khanna bluntly states: “Even minor issues from years ago can now come back with life-altering consequences for US visa holders.”","US immigration enforcement is getting tougher, with a spike in 'prudential' visa revocations.

End Of H-1B Lottery: Donald Trump Overhauls US Work Visa System Prioritising High Pay And Skills

What the J-1 visa is meant to be

How the programme became a business

Why participants could not push back

What oversight failed to fix

Why this story matters





The J-1 visa was meant to be America’s soft-power handshake. A cultural exchange that allowed young people from around the world to live, work briefly, and absorb the idea of the US as a land of opportunity, fairness and learning. Over the years, that idea quietly thinned out. In its place emerged something colder: a lightly regulated labour pipeline that blurred the line between exchange and exploitation.A recent investigation by the New York Times lays bare how a programme designed to showcase American values was steadily repurposed into a profit-driven system that left thousands of foreign students and trainees vulnerable.The J-1 visa allows foreign students, interns and trainees to work temporarily in the US under categories such as summer work travel, internships and professional training. While the programme sits under the US State Department, its day-to-day functioning is outsourced to more than a hundred approved sponsor organisations.These sponsors recruit participants overseas, place them with American employers, monitor their working conditions and act as the primary point of contact if problems arise. In theory, they are custodians of the programme’s cultural mission. In practice, they wield enormous power over people who have very little leverage once they arrive.Participation has grown dramatically. What was once a modest exchange initiative now brings hundreds of thousands of young workers into the US every year, many funnelled into low-wage sectors that struggle to attract domestic labour.The turning point was structural, not accidental.Sponsors were permitted to charge recruitment and placement fees with no upper limit. Many participants paid thousands of dollars before ever setting foot in the US, often borrowing money or draining family savings. By the time they arrived, they were already financially trapped.What awaited many of them bore little resemblance to the internships or training experiences advertised. Instead of professional exposure, participants found themselves doing physically demanding, repetitive work on farms, in factories, at processing plants or in hospitality jobs with long hours and minimal supervision.At the same time, sponsor organisations increasingly operated like commercial enterprises. Executives paid themselves large salaries. Family members appeared on payrolls. Some sponsors placed participants with businesses owned by board members or relatives. Others created side companies, including insurance providers, and required visa holders to purchase those services as a condition of participation.None of this violated the rules as they were written.The system left workers structurally dependent.A J-1 visa is tied to a sponsor. If a placement turns abusive or unsafe, the sponsor decides whether the participant can be moved elsewhere or whether their stay effectively ends. Complaining risks job loss. Job loss risks deportation.Many participants reported injuries, harassment and unsafe conditions. When they sought help, sponsors often mediated quietly with employers rather than intervening decisively. The incentive was clear. Employers are repeat clients. Participants are temporary and replaceable.Unlike other US guest worker programmes, the J-1 system does not prohibit recruitment fees, a safeguard specifically designed elsewhere to prevent debt-driven coercion. The result was a legal grey zone where pressure did not need to be explicit to be effective.None of this was unknown to authorities. Internal reviews over decades flagged profiteering, weak oversight and conflicts of interest. Lawmakers briefly considered reforms that would have capped fees and tightened controls.Those efforts stalled. Sponsors lobbied aggressively, warning that the programme could not survive without charging participants. The structure remained intact, growing larger and more lucrative with time.Even today, while sponsors are required to disclose their fees to the government, that information is not easily accessible to prospective applicants. Transparency exists largely on paper.The J-1 saga exposes an uncomfortable truth about modern immigration systems. Exploitation does not always happen at the margins or through illegal channels. It can thrive inside legal frameworks when ideals are outsourced, oversight is weak and profit incentives are left unchecked.A visa designed to promote cultural understanding ended up teaching a different lesson: that without accountability, even the most well-intentioned programmes can be bent into tools of quiet exploitation.For many young people who arrived believing in the promise of America, the exchange was real. Just not the one they were sold.","The J-1 visa allows foreign students, interns and trainees to work temporarily in the US under categories such as summer work travel, internships and professional training.

From Elon Musk to Pavel Durov: The billionaires trying to repopulate earth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/from-elon-musk-to-pavel-durov-the-billionaires-trying-to-repopulate-earth/articleshow/126173589.cms,"Elon Musk Can ‘CRY’, But He Will Still Pay $140,000,000 X Fine: EU Adamant After Hitler Attack

How demographic anxiety looks from the top

Elon Musk and the idea of reproductive leadership

Pavel Durov and scalable parenthood

The Chinese billionaire and the return of dynasties

Surrogacy, IVF and the logistics of reproduction

Silicon Valley’s quiet fertility industry

Why this makes people uneasy





For most of human history, reproduction was governed by necessity rather than desire. Children were insurance against disease, labour shortages and early death. Large families were common not because people dreamed of them, but because survival demanded redundancy. The poor reproduced because they had little else. The wealthy, protected by land, inheritance and social order, tended to limit family size because continuity was already assured.In the early 21st century, that logic has inverted in a way that feels counter-intuitive and faintly disturbing. Across much of the world, ordinary people are quietly opting out of parenthood or stopping at one child. Cities are expensive, work is relentless, childcare is punishing and women, finally able to choose, increasingly decide that motherhood must compete with autonomy, health and economic survival. At the same time, a small group of billionaires has begun moving decisively in the opposite direction. They are not merely having children. They are expanding their biological footprint deliberately, sometimes publicly and sometimes through legal and technological workarounds that allow reproduction to be scaled. Elon Musk warns repeatedly that civilisation faces demographic collapse. Pavel Durov has reframed sperm donation as a public good. In a US courtroom, a Chinese tech billionaire calmly explained his plan to father dozens of children via American surrogates so that his sons could one day inherit and run his business empire.These cases are not about family values in any traditional sense. They reveal how power, when combined with technology, begins to see reproduction as strategy rather than intimacy.Globally, fertility rates are falling almost everywhere. This is not primarily the result of ideology or cultural decay, but of material reality. Housing costs have soared, work has expanded into evenings and weekends, and the infrastructure that once supported family life has eroded. For many couples, the decision to have fewer children is not ideological at all. It is pragmatic.Demographers tend to describe this shift as a transition rather than a crisis. As societies become wealthier and more educated, family size falls. Women delay childbirth or opt out entirely. Populations age and stabilise. These trends are slow, structural and difficult to reverse through exhortation alone.For a subset of billionaire technologists, however, falling birth rates are framed very differently. Their language is apocalyptic. They speak of civilisation, extinction and existential risk. The vocabulary is not borrowed from sociology or public policy, but from science fiction and Silicon Valley’s engineering culture. These are people accustomed to thinking in terms of systems failure and technological fixes. When they look at declining fertility, they do not see social exhaustion. They see a broken system in need of intervention.This framing matters because it shapes the solutions they imagine. Rather than asking how societies might make family life sustainable for ordinary people, the focus shifts to individual action by those with capacity. Reproduction becomes a responsibility of elites.Elon Musk is the most visible proponent of this worldview. He has repeatedly described population decline as the greatest threat facing humanity, placing it above climate change, war or economic instability. His concern is not abstract. His personal life reflects his beliefs. He has fathered a large number of children across multiple relationships, and he has shown no sign of slowing down.What is striking about Musk’s rhetoric is what it omits. He rarely speaks about childcare systems, parental leave, or the emotional and physical labour of raising children. He does not engage seriously with women’s experiences of pregnancy, childbirth or career disruption. Instead, reproduction is framed as duty, contribution and leadership. Great men must step forward where society falters.In this narrative, the problem is not that modern life makes parenthood exhausting and financially risky. The problem is that people lack conviction. Musk’s solution is not collective reform, but personal example. If enough capable individuals reproduce at scale, civilisation will be preserved.It is an argument that bypasses society entirely.Pavel Durov takes the same logic and strips it of its remaining sentimentality. The Telegram founder has spoken openly about fathering over a hundred children through sperm donation, alongside children from his personal relationships. He has offered to fund IVF for women using his sperm and has promised that all his biological children will share his inheritance equally.This approach reframes parenthood in radically modern terms. There is no shared household, no daily presence, no expectation of emotional labour. Biology is separated from upbringing. Fatherhood becomes distributive rather than relational. Genes are spread at scale, while care is outsourced entirely.Durov presents this as civic duty, citing declining fertility and sperm quality. The rhetoric is calm and technocratic, but the implications are unsettling. Children become outcomes rather than relationships, and legacy becomes a matter of arithmetic rather than memory. What matters is not how a child is raised, but that the genetic line continues.This is reproduction designed for reach, not attachment.If Musk represents ideological pronatalism and Durov represents scalable biology, the Chinese tech billionaire represents something older and more recognisable. In a Los Angeles courtroom, Xu Bo, a wealthy gaming entrepreneur, revealed that he had already fathered multiple children through US surrogates and planned to have many more. His stated aim was explicit. He wanted sons who could inherit and eventually run his business empire.China’s domestic constraints, including its recent history of birth control and intense social pressures, made such ambitions difficult to pursue at home. International surrogacy provided a solution. American legal frameworks designed to help infertile couples became tools for elite family construction. Citizenship was a byproduct. Parenthood became cross-border.What makes this case revealing is its lack of abstraction. Xu Bo did not speak about saving civilisation or demographic duty. He spoke about heirs, succession and control. Reproduction was not a philosophical act, but a corporate one. Family planning sounded uncomfortably like expansion strategy.This is where the billionaire fertility project sheds its futuristic language and reveals its feudal core. Technology does not abolish dynasties. It modernises them.Across these cases, the methods are remarkably similar. IVF, surrogacy and international legal arbitrage allow wealth to override biology, geography and regulation. Children can be commissioned across borders, timelines can be extended, and legal constraints can be navigated with enough money.The women who make this possible are rarely centred in these narratives. Surrogates and donors often come from economically weaker backgrounds, and while consent exists, it exists within asymmetry. Their labour is essential, but their futures remain peripheral to the story being told about legacy and survival.What began as compassionate technology designed to help people form families increasingly functions as infrastructure for elite reproduction. Parenthood becomes logistics rather than relationship.Behind the high-profile figures lies a quieter ecosystem of belief and capital. Fertility and longevity start-ups promise extended reproductive windows, healthier embryos and improved outcomes. Venture funding flows freely. The language is reassuring and modern, full of references to choice, wellness and empowerment.Yet the underlying logic is unmistakable. Chance is inefficient. Nature is flawed. Selection is improvement. When applied to reproduction, this logic inevitably raises uncomfortable questions about whose lives are worth producing and under what conditions.The movement rarely names itself, but its echoes are familiar. It is eugenics without uniforms or slogans, sanitised by technology and softened by venture capital.The billionaire baby boom is not demographically significant. A few hundred children, even a few thousand, will not reverse global population trends. What makes the phenomenon unsettling is what it normalises.First, it collapses inequality into biology. When wealth allows people to reproduce more, later and with technological advantage, privilege compounds across generations in ways that go beyond education or inheritance. Opportunity becomes engineered.Second, it reframes women’s bodies as instruments in someone else’s future. Demographic anxiety is displaced onto reproduction, while male excess is celebrated as contribution. The burden of continuity remains unevenly distributed.Third, it misdiagnoses the underlying problem. People are not avoiding children because they lack moral conviction. They avoid children because the modern world makes parenting punishing. Billionaires bypassing that reality does nothing to fix it.Most revealing of all is how this movement imagines the future. Not as a shared social project shaped through policy, care and compromise, but as an inheritance problem to be solved privately by those with means.In a world where most people hesitate before bringing one child into an unstable future, the richest men on earth are busy ensuring that the future looks like them. That is not a demographic solution. It is a statement about power.",Elon Musk warns that civilisation faces demographic collapse. Pavel Durov has reframed sperm donation as a public good.

Trump Name On Kennedy Centre Building FREAKS OUT Jazz Artist; Christmas Eve Concert Canceled

ADC defends billboard, says goal is to spark conversation





A digital billboard carrying the message “Jesus is Palestinian” lit up New York City’s Times Square this week, quickly becoming a flashpoint for debate among tourists, holiday visitors, and social media users. Installed during the Christmas season, the display has prompted sharp reactions, with some calling it provocative and others praising it as a statement meant to spark reflection.Funded by the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC), the billboard shows the slogan in large black letters against a green background, alongside a separate panel wishing passersby a “Merry Christmas.” Its placement in one of the world’s most visited public spaces ensured immediate attention, and controversy.Several visitors interviewed by the New York Post described the billboard as “divisive” and “inflammatory,” arguing that it felt out of place during a festive period meant for unity. Some British tourists, in particular, voiced discomfort, while others said that Jesus is a universal religious figure, making any modern political or ethnic label unnecessary.Online, reactions were equally mixed. One user wrote, “That's a beautiful and thought-provoking message to see in such a vibrant place!” Another responded simply, “Wait what?”Adeb Ayoub, National Executive Director of the Arab American organization, told the New York Post that the non-profit has been renting advertising space in Times Square since earlier this year, with different messages rotating on a weekly basis.He said the broader theme behind the campaign is “America First,” aimed at encouraging people to see common ground between Arab and Muslim communities and Christians in the US during what he described as “the busiest time in New York City.”“There’s a lot more similarities between Arabs and Muslims and Christians in this country than others want to allow us to believe and there are similarities and there is a fear of culture, shared religion,” Ayoub told.“Most of the Americans in this country are Christian and the birthplace of Christianity is Palestine. If people wanna go back and forth and debate it, then great, the billboard sparked debate. At least you’re having a conversation about it. Otherwise, we’re silenced and our voices and positions don’t come out.”Ayoub added that Jewish groups he claims have waged a digital war against him since the Spring are free to promote their own views about Jesus as well.","The billboard was erected by the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC) It shows the slogan in large black letters against a green background, alongside a separate panel wishing passersby a “Merry Christmas” Its placement in one of the world’s most visited public spaces ensured immediate attention.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126173597,imgsize-50632,width-400,resizemode-4/jesus.jpg"

What is NORAD?

Trump Survives Aerial Attack? U.S. & Canada Deploy Fighters After Plane Breaches Mar-A-Lago Airspace

How does NORAD track Santa?

How can you follow Santa’s journey?





On Christmas Eve, while the world obsesses over last-minute gifts and delayed flights, one of the planet’s most serious military commands performs its most unserious duty. Deep inside command centres built to detect nuclear threats and hostile aircraft, NORAD turns its radars north and begins tracking a sleigh pulled by reindeer. It sounds like a punchline. It is not. For nearly seven decades, the North American Aerospace Defense Command has treated Santa Claus as a seasonal constant, monitored with the same institutional solemnity it reserves for far graver things.There is something quietly comforting about that. In a world saturated with cynicism, this is the rare tradition that does not apologise for believing.NORAD is a joint US–Canada military organisation tasked with defending North American airspace and monitoring maritime approaches. Its job is to provide early warning of aerospace threats, track aircraft and missiles, and coordinate responses if something suspicious enters the skies.It was created during the Cold War, an era when radar blips carried existential weight. Every screen, every alert, every false positive mattered. That legacy remains. NORAD’s systems today include ground-based radars, satellites capable of detecting heat signatures, fighter jets on alert, and command centres that never sleep.Which is precisely why its Christmas Eve ritual works. If an institution this serious can pause to track Santa, the story carries an odd authority. This is not marketing fluff. This is lore backed by radar rooms.The tradition dates back to 1955, when a department store advertisement mistakenly printed a military hotline as Santa’s phone number. Instead of redirecting callers, the officer who answered played along, telling children that Santa’s sleigh had been detected on radar. The response was so popular that NORAD adopted the idea permanently.Over the years, the explanation has evolved alongside technology. NORAD says its northern warning radars first detect Santa as he lifts off from the North Pole. Once airborne, infrared satellites pick up the heat from Rudolph’s glowing red nose, a neat narrative overlap with systems designed to detect missile launches. As Santa approaches populated areas, NORAD fighter jets from the US and Canada occasionally escort the sleigh, confirming its position and, in official imagery, offering a friendly wave.It is all delivered deadpan. No quotation marks around “tracking.” No excessive irony. The charm lies in the confidence.Every December 24, NORAD opens its Santa-tracking operation to the public. The centrepiece is the NORAD Santa Tracker website, which displays a live map of Santa’s route across countries and cities as the night progresses. Each stop comes with trivia, animations, and updates on how many presents have been delivered so far.There is also a mobile app and regular social media updates, but the most old-school element remains the call centre. Thousands of volunteers, many of them military personnel, answer phones from around the world, patiently explaining Santa’s speed, altitude, and snack preferences to eager callers.The point is not realism. It is ritual. NORAD never oversells the tech or breaks the spell. It simply offers a straight-faced narrative and lets the audience decide how much to believe.In an age where surveillance usually signals anxiety and control, NORAD’s Santa tracker flips the script. For one night, radars are not watching for threats but for generosity. Missiles are replaced by milk and cookies. And somewhere between the Arctic and your rooftop, a military command reminds the world that even the most hardened systems can make room for wonder.","NORAD is a joint US–Canada military organisation tasked with defending North American airspace and monitoring maritime approaches.

Watch: Trump’s ‘bad Santa’ warning on Christmas Eve; how US President and Melania marked the holiday,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/watch-trumps-bad-santa-warning-on-christmas-eve-how-us-president-and-melania-marked-the-holiday/articleshow/126169350.cms,"Donald Trump (AP image)

Trump Quizzes Kids On Christmas, Then Drops US Border Warning As Melania Watches; 'No Bad Santa...'





US President Donald Trump marked Christmas Eve in a light-hearted mood, joking with children about Santa Claus, coal-filled stockings and even a “bad Santa” infiltrating the country. He joined first lady Melania Trump for the annual NORAD Santa-tracking calls from their Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.Vacationing at his Palm Beach resort, Trump took part in the Christmas Eve tradition on Wednesday that allows children who call the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) to track Santa Claus as the US military playfully follows his journey around the world.Some of these calls are patched through to the president, giving youngsters a chance to speak directly with the commander-in-chief.Speaking to children from several US states, the president struck a jovial tone and said he enjoyed the interaction so much that he “could do this all day long.” However, he further highlighted that he would eventually have to return to pressing global issues, including efforts to end the war between Russia and Ukraine.“We want to make sure that Santa is being good. Santa’s a very good person,” Trump said while speaking to children aged between four and ten.“We want to make sure that he’s not infiltrated, that we’re not infiltrating into our country a bad Santa.”US President and Melania Trump sat side by side and took around a dozen calls between them. While the first lady spoke quietly with children, advising them to sleep early so Santa could arrive, the president joked about her focus.“She’s able to focus totally, without listening,” Trump said as Melania remained on her call.During the conversations, Trump mixed humour with reassurance. When an eight-year-old girl from North Carolina asked whether Santa would be angry if children did not leave cookies for him, Trump replied, “He won’t get mad, but I think he’ll be very disappointed.”“You know, Santa — he tends to be a little bit on the cherubic side. You know what cherubic means? A little on the heavy side,” he added. “I think Santa would like some cookies.”In another call, an eight-year-old girl from Kansas said she hoped Santa would not leave coal in her stocking.“You mean clean, beautiful coal?” Trump responded, invoking a phrase he has frequently used while promoting domestic coal production. Laughing, he added, “I had to do that, I’m sorry.”“Coal is clean and beautiful. Please remember that, at all costs,” Trump said, before acknowledging that the child preferred a Barbie doll, clothes and candy.At several points, Trump referenced the military updates on Santa’s location, relayed by a general overseeing the NORAD operation, telling children when Santa would be reaching their homes.Despite the festive tone of the calls, Trump later returned to his familiar political messaging. Shortly after wrapping up the Christmas Eve conversations, he posted on his Truth Social platform: “Merry Christmas to all, including the Radical Left Scum that is doing everything possible to destroy our Country, but are failing badly.”Trump contrasted his administration’s achievements with policies he opposes.“We no longer have Open Borders, Men in Women's Sports, Transgender for Everyone, or Weak Law Enforcement. What we do have is a Record Stock Market and 401K’s, Lowest Crime numbers in decades, No Inflation, and yesterday, a 4.3 GDP, two points better than expected,” he added.Trump has a history of using Christmas messages to criticise political opponents. In past years, he has posted holiday greetings aimed at what he has described as the “Radical Left Lunatics.”On Christmas Eve, however, the president appeared to enjoy the lighter moment, telling reporters watching nearby at Mar-a-Lago that speaking with children during the Santa-tracking calls was a welcome break from global affairs.","US President Donald Trump joined first lady Melania Trump for annual NORAD Santa-tracking calls from their Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.

30,000 pages released





The US Department of Justice on Tuesday said that it has uncovered over a million additional documents “potentially related” to the Jeffrey Epstein case.In a social media post on X, the Department of Justice said that finishing the release of all of Epstein’s files could take a “few more weeks.”“The US Attorney for the Southern District of New York and the FBI have informed the Department of Justice that they have uncovered over a million more documents potentially related to the Jeffrey Epstein case. The DOJ has received these documents from SDNY and the FBI to review them for release, in compliance with the Epstein Files Transparency Act, existing statutes, and judicial orders,” the DOJ said.“We have lawyers working around the clock to review and make the legally required redactions to protect victims, and we will release the documents as soon as possible. Due to the massive volume of material, this process may take a few more weeks. The Department will continue to fully comply with federal law and President Trump’s direction to release the files,” it added.This comes days after the DOJ released 30,000 more pages of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein, while noting that some of these documents contain “untrue” claims made against President Donald Trump.In an X post, the DOJ claimed that the documents against Donald Trump are “false” and would have been “weaponised” against him.“The Department of Justice has officially released nearly 30,000 more pages of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein. Some of these documents contain untrue and sensationalist claims made against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election. To be clear: the claims are unfounded and false, and if they had a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponised against President Trump already. Nevertheless, out of our commitment to the law and transparency, the DOJ is releasing these documents with the legally required protections for Epstein’s victims,” the DOJ wrote on X.A 2021 subpoena to the Mar-a-Lago Club, founded by Trump in 1995, is also among the documents, as reported by CNN. The subpoena relates to a probe into Epstein’s former girlfriend and convicted accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell The documents also include a letter signed by “J Epstein,” which was sent to convicted sex offender Larry Nassar in the same month Epstein died by suicide in 2019. The letter, as reported by CNN, makes references to Trump without explicitly naming him. The letter contains the phrase “our president.”However, the DOJ said that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has confirmed that the letter is fake. The DOJ noted that the writing in the letter does not appear to match Epstein’s, and the letter was postmarked three days after his death.The US passed the Epstein Files Transparency Act last month, prompting the DOJ to release documents related to Epstein, who was charged as a sex offender.Newly released documents tied to Epstein have put a spotlight on previously unseen photos of the late convicted sex offender with a host of high-profile figures, including legendary popstar Michael Jackson, musician Mick Jagger, and former US President Bill Clinton.The DOJ has released thousands of files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell, but a substantial number of documents remain unpublished.Among the newly released documents is a grand jury interview with an unnamed FBI agent from May 2007. The agent described an allegation that Epstein recruited a 15-year-old girl to give him a topless massage.The agent said a witness had recruited other girls from among their peer group, adding: “Epstein liked girls like her, which is thin and blonde and attractive,” as quoted by The Independent.Another witness quoted in the files described Epstein as selective and highly focused on the age of the girls he allowed to work for him, adding that Epstein rejected some girls he “didn’t really like” and once dismissed a potential masseur as “too old” at 23.","The US Department of Justice on Tuesday said that it has uncovered over a million additional documents “potentially related” to the Jeffrey Epstein case.

Pak PM Sharif's Party Leader Threatens India, Warns Missiles Will Respond If Bangladesh Is Targeted





In a sharp attack on Pakistan’s security establishment, Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman accused the military leadership of employing a “double standard” regarding cross-border military operations. Speaking at a recent gathering in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the influential Deobandi cleric questioned the logical consistency of Pakistan’s defence policy, specifically contrasting Islamabad’s recent strikes in Afghanistan with its diplomatic outrage over Indian activities within Pakistani borders.He asked Pakistan’s military brass why India’s actions inside Pakistan should be condemned when Islamabad justifies strikes in Afghanistan by calling them attacks on its enemies. Rehman argued that if Pakistan claimed a sovereign right to launch pre-emptive or retaliatory strikes against perceived enemies on Afghan soil, it weakened its moral and legal standing when protesting similar actions by India. “We sent militants to Afghanistan for 20 years. .. from giving them Kalashnikovs to Cruise missiles... we empowered them in every way. When you bombed Kabul, it was as if someone had bombed your Islamabad.This is the limit, isn’t it? If you had bombed the remote areas, you might have been able to tolerate it. So, you took some action there as well...”“...If you say, and I have questions, that we have attacked the enemy’s headquarters and you call this a legitimate statement, India says to you that it has attacked Bahawalpur, it has attacked Muridke, it has attacked the headquarters of those who are operating against us in Kashmir. Why are you objecting to this? And if you object to this, and if you have the same claims against Afghanistan, how will you justify it..?”Rehman’s criticism comes at a time when Pakistan’s Field Marshal Asim Munir continues his anti-India rhetoric and claims that Pakistan received “divine help” during the military confrontation with India in May which was felt during the days of intense fighting that followed Indian strikes on terror targets.Rehman’s comments touch upon a sensitive nerve in geopolitics, specifically referring to locations like Bahawalpur and Muridke — areas long identified as hubs for terrorist groups like JeM and LeT — which were decimated during Operation Sindoor. By asking, “Why different rules for India?” Rehman highlighted the strategic hypocrisy: justification of “counterterrorism strikes” in the west, while demanding absolute territorial sanctity in the east.",Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman accused the military leadership of employing a “double standard” regarding cross-border military operations.

'90% Own Tech...Took Out Rafale, S-400': Asim Munir Makes Absurd Claims On India-Pak Conflict





JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman on Tuesday said that Pakistan should not oppose attacks by India if the country itself was attacking Afghanistan.Speaking to journalists in Rehman said, “If you justify attacking Afghanistan by claiming you are targeting your enemy there, then why do you object when India targets its enemy in Bahawalpur and Murid (inside Pakistan)?”He further warned that continued tensions between the two neighbours would only destabilise the region and said dialogue and political engagement were the only lasting solutions.The JUI-F chief also slammed Pakistan's army saying political power belonged to the people and not the armed forces, reported local news paper The Express Tribune.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan’s chief of defence forces field marshal Asim Munir has claimed that Islamabad received “divine help” during the military confrontation with India in May, while also asking Afghanistan’s Taliban regime to choose between Pakistan and the Tehrik i Taliban Pakistan, PTI reported.Addressing the National Ulema Conference in Islamabad, Munir in a widely circulated video said Pakistan’s armed forces experienced “divine intervention” during the four day conflict triggered after India launched Operation Sindoor. “We felt it,” he said.India carried out Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan occupied Kashmir in retaliation for the Pahalgam attack that killed 26 civilians. The strikes led to intense clashes between the two countries for four days and ended with an understanding to halt military actions on May 10.Meanwhile, Munir warned the Afghan Taliban to choose between Pakistan and the TTP, saying Afghan nationals form the majority of militants infiltrating across the border. “In the TTP formations coming [into Pakistan], 70 per cent are Afghans,” he said. “Is Afghanistan not spilling the blood of our Pakistani children?” He reiterated that Kabul must decide between Pakistan and the TTP.The Field Marshal also said that no one could declare jihad in an Islamic state except the state itself. “No one can issue a fatwa for jihad without the order and permission and will of those vested with the authority,” he said.Munir also drew parallels between Pakistan and the state established by the Prophet 1,400 years ago in the Arab region, now Saudi Arabia.He said that among the world’s 57 Islamic countries, “God gave us the honour of being the protectors of Haramain Sharifain,” referring to Makkah and Madina.Official details of the December 10 address were limited, with selected clips aired later by Pakistani media.","Pakistan’s chief of defence forces field marshal Asim Munir has claimed that Islamabad received ‘divine help’ during the military confrontation with India in May.

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan , currently incarcerated for now over two years, on Saturday called on his supporters to prepare for nationwide protests and announced his intention to challenge the recent Toshakhana-II verdict, which he alleged was delivered in “haste” by the Islamabad high court. Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, were sentenced to 17 years in prison in the corruption case earlier this week.He also alleged that Pakistan is being governed by solely under ""Asim law.""With no access to his social media accounts, Khan conveyed his message through his legal team. According to a post on X summarising a conversation between the PTI founder and his lawyer, Khan instructed Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Sohail Afridi to begin preparations for a mass street movement.In the detailed message shared by his team, Khan said: “To strive for justice is a sacred duty, and I am ready to lay down my life for Haqeeqi Azadi (true freedom) of my nation. At this moment, Pakistan is being governed solely under ‘Asim Law’. Here, verdicts are pre-written and merely announced aloud. Like the baseless decisions and sentences of the past three years, the Toshakhana 2 verdict is nothing new for me. This ruling, too, was delivered in haste, without any evidence and without fulfilling legal requirements.Neither we nor our lawyers were even given opportunity to present our case.”He alleged that both he and Bushra Bibi were being subjected to harsh solitary confinement. “The sustained solitary confinement imposed on me and my wife constitutes severe mental torture. We are barred from books, television, and meetings… The books sent by my family are confiscated by jail authorities, and we are kept in solitary confinement for weeks at a time. This treatment is inhumane, yet all this oppression and brutality cannot weaken my resolve. ”Khan also accused the authorities of persecuting women linked to PTI. “It is not our tradition to target women and children… I am deeply saddened and distressed by the mistreatment and brutality faced by my sisters and other women outside Adiala Jail. The treatment meted out to Bushra Bibi, Dr. Yasmin, Mahrang Baloch, and other women stands in clear violation of Islamic traditions and moral values.”The former prime minister again directed his criticism at army chief Asim Munir . “The army is mine and belongs to the people of Pakistan. When I criticise Asim Munir, it is criticism of an individual… Whatever is happening to me in jail is being carried out on the instructions of a colonel acting under Asim Munir’s orders.”Urging the legal fraternity to mobilise, Khan said: “For the struggle to restore the rule of law and uphold the Constitution, it is essential for the Insaf Lawyers Forum and legal fraternity to step forward decisively.”He added that he had instructed his legal team to appeal the verdict: “I have full confidence in Salman Safdar and his team and have instructed them to file an appeal against these bogus decisions in the Islamabad high court.” Concluding his message, he said: “My message for Sohail Afridi is to prepare for a street movement. The entire nation must rise for their rights!! To strive for justice is a sacred duty, and I am ready to lay down my life for Haqeeqi Azadi (true freedom) of my nation. ”The message was signed off as: “Illegally Incarcerated Former Prime Minister of Pakistan, Imran Khan, speaking to his lawyers after the verdict of a military-style trial in Adiala Jail.”In an official statement, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) described the verdict as “blatantly unconstitutional, illegal, malicious and the worst form of political revenge and a textbook case of victimisation.”The party-led by Imran Khan alleged that the conviction aimed to prolong Khan’s imprisonment and ease pressure on what it called a “petrified ruling clique,” claiming political vendetta was being executed through a “subservient” judiciary.Addressing a press conference alongside senior party leader Asad Qaiser, PTI secretary general Salman Akram Raja said Khan had met his lead counsel, Barrister Salman Safdar, in the courtroom and shared a message for the nation. He quoted Khan as saying, “I am standing firm and resolute and will not seek an apology from anyone, come what may.”Raja added that the case lacked substantive evidence. “They have no witnesses except the person whom the PTI founder himself brought forward,” he said.Heavy police deployment was enforced across Rawalpindi, with more than 1,300 police officers and security personnel stationed at key locations to maintain law and order, after former Imran Khan called for the nationwide protests.","Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, were sentenced to 17 years in prison in the corruption case earlier this week.

Water crisis deepens public health risks





At least two women were killed and several others injured in Balochistan’s Noshki district after a passenger waggon skidded on a rain-soaked highway and collided with an oncoming truck, Dawn reported. The vehicle was travelling from Quetta to Chagai when the crash occurred near the Sher Jan Agha area.Five passengers sustained injuries, with two shifted to Quetta for critical care. Hospital officials said at least eight people hurt in rain-related incidents were brought to the Civil Hospital.The rainfall, which began on Saturday, ended a prolonged dry spell in the Quetta valley, offering brief relief to drought-hit farmers. However, it also caused widespread disruption. Despite forecasts ruling out significant rainfall, showers intensified by noon, flooding roads, halting traffic and plunging large parts of Quetta into darkness after electricity supplies were suspended. Mobile networks were also disrupted, leaving residents without communication for hours.Low-lying neighbourhoods, particularly areas with mud houses and weak construction, were badly affected as rainwater entered homes.Heavy rainfall was reported across several districts, including Ziarat, Pishin, Kalat, Zhob, Mastung and Sibi, with power outages lasting for hours in many areas.Meanwhile, experts warned that Pakistan’s water-quality crisis is worsening. Speaking at a seminar organised by the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE) in Islamabad, specialists said only 47 per cent of the population has access to safe drinking water, according to The Express Tribune.Dr Hifza Rasheed of the Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources said per capita freshwater availability has dropped from 5,260 cubic metres in 1951 to below 1,000 cubic metres in 2024, placing Pakistan among water-scarce nations. Unsafe water, experts said, accounts for nearly 40 per cent of illnesses nationwide and contributes to tens of thousands of child deaths each year.","A passenger waggon skidded on a rain-soaked highway and collided with an oncoming truck in Balochistan.

Ex-PM Imran Khan And Bushra Bibi Jailed For 17 Years In Toshakhana Gift Jewellery Case





Pakistan’s former Prime Minister Imran Khan has asked his supporters to prepare for nationwide protests and said he will challenge his conviction in the Islamabad High Court after he and his wife, Bushra Bibi, were sentenced to 17 years in prison in the Toshakhana-II corruption case on Saturday.Khan, who does not currently have access to his social media accounts, conveyed his message through his legal team.According to a post on X cited by Dawn, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder said he had instructed Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi to begin preparations for a mass street movement. “I have sent a message to [Khyber Pakhtunkhwa CM] Sohail Afridi to prepare for the street movement.

Quoted by ANI, residents and journalists in Lahore and Peshawar questioned the credibility of the ruling, with some alleging political motives and a lack of evidence, saying the verdict had further weakened public trust in the justice system and democratic institutions.","Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, were sentenced to 17 years in prison in the Toshakhana-II corruption case on Saturday.

‘Might Never See Him Again’: Imran Khan’s Sons Claim 'Psychological Torture' In Pak's Adiala Jail





NEW DELHI: The Pakistan government on Saturday clarified that there is ""no embargo"" on former prime minister Imran Khan 's sons meeting their incarcerated father if they travel to the country. The government official also said the brothers would be granted Pakistani visas should they wish to come and visit him.The statement came after reports suggested that authorities had imposed unannounced restrictions on visits to Imran Khan, claiming that some visitors were using the meetings to advance political agendas. Following these reports, members of his family and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) expressed concern about the conditions in which he is being held.""There has been no embargo on Suleman Khan and Kasim Khan to meet their father, Imran Khan, at Adiala Jail, Rawalpindi,"" Interior state minister Talal Chaudhry told reporters.Suleman and Kasim, who currently live in London, are Khan’s sons from his first marriage to British TV personality Jemima Goldsmith.Chaudhry’s clarification comes days after the brothers told Sky News they fear they may never see their jailed father again.The brothers said they have not seen or spoken to the PTI founder, imprisoned since August 2023, for months, and voiced concerns about his safety and well-being.“If Suleman and Kasim apply for a Pakistani visa, we will give them. We will not stop them from meeting their father; therefore, the propaganda that the Pakistani government is creating hurdles in the meeting between father and sons should be stopped,” Chaudhry said.He also rejected reports that Khan is being kept in solitary confinement for 23 hours a day.In their interview, the brothers alleged that their father is being held in isolation, calling the conditions “clear torture tactics.”Khan, who has been in jail since August 2023, faces multiple cases filed against him since his ouster from power in April 2022.A United Nations special rapporteur has also warned that Khan is being held in conditions that may amount to inhuman or degrading treatment.In the interview, Kasim claimed Khan is confined to a cell measuring “six feet by eight inches,” barely large enough to stand.“They are not even allowing guards to speak to him because they want total isolation from any other person, just to try and break him. So it’s all very clear torture tactics,” he said.","Suleman and Kasim Khan are Imran Khan's sons from his first marriage.

NEW DELHI: A special court of Pakistan’s Federal Investigation Agency on Saturday sentenced former prime minister and Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf founder Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi to 17 years of imprisonment each in the Toshakhana 2 corruption case, Dawn reported.The court also imposed a fine of Pakistani Rs 16.4 million (INR 52,39,524) on each of them. Failure to pay the fine will result in additional jail time, according to the law.Citing the court order copy, Dawn reported that the sentences took into account Imran Khan’s age and the fact that Bushra Bibi is a woman, resulting in what the court described as a “lenient” punishment. “This court, while passing sentences has considered the old age of Imran Ahmed Khan Niazi, as well as the fact that Bushra Imran Khan is a female. It is in consideration of both said factors that a lenient view has been taken in awarding lesser punishment,” the order said.The verdict was delivered by special judge central Shahrukh Arjumand during a hearing held at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail, where Imran Khan is currently imprisoned.According to Dawn, the case relates to the alleged purchase of an expensive Bulgari jewellery set that was gifted to Imran Khan by the Saudi crown prince during an official visit in May 2021 and later acquired at a throwaway price.Imran Khan was sentenced to a total of 17 years in prison, including 10 years’ rigorous imprisonment under sections 34 and 409 of the Pakistan Penal Code and seven years under Section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act. Bushra Bibi was awarded the same sentence under identical provisions.The court also granted the benefit of Section 382 B of the Criminal Procedure Code, which allows the period of detention already undergone to be considered while awarding the sentence.Following the verdict, lawyers representing Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi said they would challenge the decision before the high court.The two were indicted in the case in December last year. Dawn noted that earlier this year in October, both had denied the allegations, calling the case fabricated and politically motivated.As per Dawn, while recording his statement under Section 342 of the Criminal Procedure Code, Imran Khan rejected the prosecution’s narrative and said the case was “malicious, fabricated, and politically engineered”. He argued that he did not qualify as a public servant under the Pakistan Penal Code and claimed he was unaware of the specific details of the gift, which he said was presented to his wife.Dawn further reported that the PTI founder maintained that due process was followed under the Toshakhana Policy 2018 and that the gift was declared, assessed and legally retained after payment to the national exchequer. “We complied with the Toshakhana Policy in letter and spirit,” he said.","Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi sentenced to 17 years of imprisonment each in corruption case.

Pakistan police on Wednesday registered a case under the Anti-Terrorism Act against the sisters of former prime minister Imran Khan and dozens of his supporters after a protest sit-in outside Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi.The protest on Tuesday was held after authorities refused to allow family members and lawyers to meet Khan, who is currently incarcerated. His sisters, along with leaders and workers of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), staged the sit-in outside the jail to protest the restriction.Police said a first information report (FIR) was lodged at Police Station Saddar Beroni, Rawalpindi, naming Khan’s sisters Aleema Khan and Noreen Niazi, as well as several PTI leaders and supporters. Those named include Salman Akram Raja, Naeem Panjotha, Qasim Khan, Aliya Hamza and Raja Nasir Abbas.Authorities also invoked Section 120 of the Pakistan Penal Code for alleged criminal conspiracy against the state, along with charges of attacking police personnel and violating Section 144.Police said, as reported by PTI, at least 14 suspects were arrested at the scene late Tuesday night, and efforts are continuing to arrest others named in the FIR.Imran Khan has been in jail since August 2023 and faces multiple cases filed after his removal from office in April 2022.Officials have placed restrictions on meetings with Khan, saying such visits are being used for political purposes.

Survival without transformation





How is Pakistan’s economy still surviving? The question continues to arise as the country grapples with prolonged economic stress despite years of weak growth and low human development indicators.In recent years, Pakistan has dealt with sharp currency swings, runaways inflation between 2022 and 2024, persistent balance-of-payments pressures and mounting external debt burden. Yet the economy has managed to dodge a complete collapse, largely due to repeated bailouts from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and emergency financing from external partners.China has been key to this survival. Chinese loans and infrastructure investments have provided short-term relief but have also deepened Islamabad's financial dependence on Beijing. At the same time, Pakistan has sought to rebuild ties with the United States, long regarded as a key economic and diplomatic backstop.In this outreach, both army chief Asim Munir, now seen as the Pakistan's de facto power centre, and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif have taken apparent steps to engage Washington. The two leaders went ahead to nominate US President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, citing his role in easing military tensions with India.However, New Delhi had turned down the claims of any foreign influence in peaceful agreement with Islamabad in May this year.And Uncle Sam responded with goodwill. Compared to several other countries, it was exempted from steep trade tariffs, with Washington announcing a lower levy of 19%. Trump has also spoken of possible cooperation in developing what he described as ""massive oil reserves"" in Pakistan.The power structure in Pakistan has also been a point of concern in its economic turmoil. The military's expanding role in governance has often overshadowed the civilian leadership, while former prime minister and a popular leader Imran Khan remains in prison, keeping political tensions high and weighing on investor confidence.Neighbouring countries have also added to Pakistan’s economic strain. India’s suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty has emerged as a major setback, while Afghanistan’s Taliban government has announced plans to build dams upstream, moves that could further affect water availability and pose another risk to Pakistan’s economy and GDP growth.For now, Pakistan’s economy continues to function through foreign assistance, administrative controls and short-term stabilisation measures. Without sustained political stability, meaningful reforms and an effective check on corruption, its economic survival remains fragile.One of the most important stabilisers of Pakistan's economy has been the continued support from the International Monetary Fund and other multilateral lenders.The Governance and Corruption Diagnostic Assessment (GCDA) finalised in November 2025, was released ahead of the Fund's executive board's expected approval of a $1.2 billion disbursement, part of the ongoing 37-month, $7 billion programme started under the prime ministership of Shehbaz Sharif.With the latest approval, Pakistan has received around $3.3 billion from the IMF since last year. Under the bailout programme, Islamabad will continue to receive loan instalments over a 37-month period, contingent on meeting the agreed reform conditions.Pakistan narrowly avoided default in 2023 only after the IMF extended an earlier nine-month emergency deal, which was followed by the current longer programme. Since 1958, Pakistan has turned to the IMF 25 times, making it one of the IMF's most frequent borrowers.In 2025, IMF disbursements helped rebuild foreign exchange buffers, reassure markets and finance imports and debt servicing, according to Reuters.Pakistan's central bank has used monetary policy as a tactical tool to stabilise inflation while cautiously supporting growth.On December 15, the State Bank of Pakistan cut its key interest rate by 50 basis points to 10.5%, breaking a four-meeting hold. The SBP said the move was aimed at supporting sustainable economic growth while keeping inflation within target.According to Reuters, all 12 analysts in a Reuters poll had expected the central bank to hold the policy rate at 11%, particularly after the IMF warned against premature easing under Pakistan's $7 billion loan programme.The rate cut highlighted Pakistan's effort to revive domestic economic activity without destabilising the IMF-backed stabilisation framework.Despite underlying weaknesses, Pakistan has seen improving sentiment in financial markets.Credit ratings agencies S&P Global, Fitch and Moody’s upgraded Pakistan’s credit ratings in 2025, citing stronger finances and revenue gains. Investor appetite for Pakistan’s dollar bonds and equities has strengthened, with bonds delivering nearly 22% returns this year and the benchmark stock index gaining 44%, among the best performers in Asia.Bloomberg Economics estimates growth quickened to 3.4% year-on-year in the second quarter, with official data expected shortly.However, with the backdrop of political chaos, most notably the continued imprisonment of the country's most popular political figure, Imran Khan, investors have little confidence to make long-term plans in Pakistan.Pakistan has also moved to rebuild economic ties with the United States.According to Bloomberg, Islamabad is planning an investor conference in Washington to draw American investment in energy, mining and technology. Finance minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said the sectors where Pakistan seeks US investment are clearly identified.Economic links have improved following a new US-Pakistan trade deal setting a 19% tariff, lower than regional peers and well below the 50% tariff imposed on India.Meanwhile, Trump also promised to help Pakistan develop what he described as ""massive oil reserves"" on Pakistani soil. The remarks followed sustained praise and outreach from Pakistan’s de facto power centre, army chief Asim Munir, and were later echoed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who went on to nominate Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize on several occasions.“The first thing was to get the trade equation out of the way, which it is now,” Aurangzeb told Bloomberg.""Every single industry in Pakistan has to have an export component, because it’s the only way we're going to get out of this boom-and-bust cycle,"" Aurangzeb added.Beyond Western partners, Pakistan continues to rely heavily on China.According to the Middle East Institute, Pakistan’s strategic reliance on Beijing has deepened, particularly through the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). In January, Dawn reported that Pakistan and China reaffirmed their commitment to high-quality development of CPEC 2.0, focusing on industrialisation, special economic zones, clean energy, agriculture and livelihood projects.Chinese support has provided Pakistan with infrastructure investment, energy projects and diplomatic backing at moments of economic stress.While IMF financing has stabilised Pakistan, the IMF's own assessment paints a deeply troubling picture of governance in the Islamic Republic.The IMF's Governance and Corruption Diagnostic Assessment concluded that corruption in Pakistan is driven by ""state capture"", where public policy is manipulated to benefit a narrow circle of political and business elites.The 186-page report described dysfunctional institutions unable to enforce the rule of law or protect public resources. Corruption, the IMF said, is persistent and corrosive, distorting markets, eroding public trust and undermining fiscal stability.The report warns that without dismantling entrenched structures of elite privilege, Pakistan’s economic stagnation will persist.According to the IMF, the most economically damaging corruption involves privileged entities that exert influence over key economic sectors, including those owned by or affiliated with the state.Stefan Dercon, a professor of economic policy at the University of Oxford who has advised Pakistan on reforms, told Al Jazeera that lack of accountability continues to erode economic potential.""Failure of implementation [of laws and principles of accountability] gives vested interests too often free rein and addressing this must be at the core of efforts for economic reform,"" Dercon said.Ali Hasanain, associate professor of economics at the Lahore University of Management Sciences, said the IMF’s findings mirror long-standing domestic research.""The IMF diagnostic repeats what many domestic studies, including those by the World Bank and Pakistan’s own institutions, have already emphasised: Powerful interests shape rules to maintain their advantage,"" Hasanain told Al Jazeera.A 2021 UNDP report found that economic privileges granted to Pakistan’s elite, including politicians and the powerful military, amount to roughly 6 percent of GDP.The IMF report also flags governance risks linked to the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), created in June 2023 to promote investment and comprising both civilian and military leaders.The GCDA raises concerns over broad legal immunity granted to SIFC officials and the council’s authority to exempt projects from regulatory requirements.“The recently established Special Investment Facilitation Council, which has been vested with substantial authority to facilitate foreign investments, operates with untested transparency and accountability provisions,” the IMF report said.The Fund urged greater transparency, including annual public reporting on investments facilitated and concessions granted.The World Bank has warned that macroeconomic stabilisation has not translated into meaningful improvements in living standards.""Business as usual is not good for the economy,"" said Mukhtar Ul Hasan, World Bank economist and lead author of a report on Pakistan.""Pakistan's growth potential has been declining for decades"" due to weak competitiveness, limited reforms and recurring crises, he added.The World Bank projects growth of 3% this year and 3.4% next year, far below what is needed to absorb 1.6 million new labour market entrants annually.The Bank’s poverty and resilience report shows poverty rising again to over 27% by 2023–24, with nearly half the population living below the lower-middle-income poverty line. Rural areas, especially Balochistan and interior Sindh, face far greater deprivation.Geopolitics has added new economic risks.After a Pakistan-sponsored terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 civilians, India answered strongly to its misadventure by putting the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance. Islamabad responded by warning that any attempt to stop or divert water flows would be treated as an ""act of war.""Around 80% of Pakistani farms depend on the Indus system, as do nearly all hydropower projects. India had also identified hydropower projects in Jammu and Kashmir that could expand capacity to 12,000 MW from the current 3,360 MW, according to Reuters.In May 2025 India’s crossborder counterterror action under Operation Sindoor, marked a sharp escalation in India-Pakistan security dynamics. Military operations and reciprocal measures elevate defence spending, crowd out development spending, spook investors, and raise insurance and logistics costs for trade.Pakistan suffered a major setback after Indian strikes severely damaged nine of its key airbases, including Nur Khan and Rahim Yar Khan, dealing a significant blow to its military infrastructure.Pakistan’s economic capacity has been heavily drained by sustained military expenditure driven by its adversarial policies toward India, a burden that has come at the cost of investment in social sectors and has pushed the country down across multiple human development indicators.Reports indicate Afghanistan's new dam projects on rivers that feed Pakistan (Kunar/Kabul tributaries) will further diminish cross-border flows into Pakistan’s north-west. Combined with India’s measures, this convergence would be a ""double blast"" to Pakistani water security — concentrated in already drought-prone provinces that supply major agricultural output.Reduced river flows affect irrigation, livelihoods and hydroelectricity; they also fuel internal migration pressures and raise the social cost of adjustment. Regional cooperation mechanisms for water management have weakened, making unilateral upstream development a direct economic shock for downstream Pakistan.Pakistan’s economy is surviving due to IMF support, tactical policy moves, selective foreign investment and geopolitical manoeuvring, including heavy dependence on China and US.But without deep structural reform, dismantling elite privilege and restoring institutional accountability, survival may continue without delivering broad-based prosperity, leaving the country trapped in the same cycle of crisis and rescue that has defined its economic history.","Pakistan narrowly avoided default in 2023 only after the IMF extended an earlier nine-month emergency deal. Since 1958, Pakistan has turned to the IMF 25 times, making it one of the IMF's most borrowers. Without sustained political stability, meaningful reforms and an effective check on corruption, Pakistan's economic survival remains fragile.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126040218,imgsize-1276209,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-82.jpg"

Trump Puts Asim Munir On Gaza Test: Can Pak Army Chief Appease U.S & Avoid Backlash At Home?

'Pressure to deliver'

Munir's unprecedented power

Risks at home





Pakistan's de facto state head and most powerful army chief in decades is facing the toughest test of his expanding stronghold in Islamabad power centre as the United States presses Islamabad to send troops to a Gaza stabilisation force, a move analysts told Reuters could spark strong domestic backlash. It could also ""annoy the US president"" if Munir shows disinterest in contributing to the peace plan.Military chief Munir, who holds enormous influenceover Pakistan's political and economic decisions, is expected to travel to Washington in the coming weeks to meet US President Donald Trump . It would be their third meeting in six months and is likely to focus on Pakistan's possible role in Gaza, according to two sources familiar with the matter, one of whom is closely involved in Munir’s economic outreach to the US.Trump's proposed 20-point plan for Gaza calls for troops from Muslim-majority countries to oversee a transition period focused on reconstruction and economic recovery in the Palestinian territory. Gaza has been devastated by more than two years of Israeli military bombardment.Many countries are cautious about joining such a force because it could involve disarming Hamas, Gaza's Islamist militant group. Analysts say this risks pulling foreign troops deeper into the conflict and could inflame pro-Palestinian and anti-Israeli public opinion at home.Munir, however, has developed close ties with Trump as part of an effort to repair years of strained relations between Washington and Islamabad. In June, Trump hosted Munir for a private lunch at the White House — the first time a US president met Pakistan’s army chief alone, without any civilian leaders present.""Not contributing (to the Gaza stabilisation force) could annoy Trump, which is no small matter for a Pakistani state that appears quite keen to remain in his good graces - in great part to secure U.S. investment and security aid,"" said Michael Kugelman, Senior Fellow, South Asia at the Washington-based Atlantic Council.Pakistan is the world's only Muslim-majority country with nuclear weapons and has a powerful, experienced military. It has fought three wars with rival India, a brief conflict earlier this year, and has long battled insurgencies in its remote regions. It is also currently fighting Islamist militants that it says operate from neighbouring Afghanistan.Because of this military capability, expectations are higher for Pakistan to contribute, said defence analyst and author Ayesha Siddiqa.Pakistan’s military strength means ""there is a greater pressure on Munir to deliver his capacity,"" she said.Pakistan’s military, foreign office and information ministry did not respond to Reuters’ questions. The White House also did not reply to a request for comment.Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said last month that Pakistan could consider contributing troops for peacekeeping, but made clear that disarming Hamas was not Islamabad’s responsibility.Earlier this month, Munir was appointed chief of the defence forces, placing the army, air force and navy under his command. He also received a job extension until 2030.Under constitutional amendments passed by Pakistan’s civilian government last month, Munir will retain his field marshal rank for life and enjoy lifetime immunity from criminal prosecution.""Few people in Pakistan enjoy the luxury of being able to take risks more than Munir. He has unbridled power, now constitutionally protected,"" Kugelman said.In recent weeks, Munir has met leaders from Indonesia, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Jordan, Egypt and Qatar, according to military statements. Siddiqa said these meetings appear aimed at consulting Muslim countries on the proposed Gaza force.At home, however, the biggest risk is political unrest. Any deployment of Pakistani troops to Gaza under a US-backed plan could revive protests by Islamist parties that strongly oppose the US and Israel.These groups have the ability to bring thousands of supporters onto the streets.In October, authorities banned a powerful and violent Islamist party known for pushing Pakistan’s strict blasphemy laws. Officials said its leaders were arrested, more than 1,500 supporters detained, and its assets and bank accounts seized. Despite the ban, analysts say the group’s ideology still has influence.Supporters of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan, whose party won the most seats in the 2024 elections, are also deeply hostile to Munir and could mobilise against him.Abdul Basit, Senior Associate Fellow at Singapore’s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, warned that any escalation after deployment could quickly spiral.""People will say 'Asim Munir is doing Israel's bidding' - it will be foolhardy of anyone not to see it coming.""",Pakistan's de facto state head and most powerful army chief in decades is facing the toughest test of his expanding stronghold in Islamabad power centre. Asim Munir is expected to travel to Washington in the coming weeks to meet US President Donald Trump. It would be their third meeting in six months.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126039313,imgsize-900554,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

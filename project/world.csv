Florida's 11th execution of 2025: Curtis Windom put to death - all you need to know about the case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/floridas-11th-execution-of-2025-curtis-windom-put-to-death-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-case/articleshow/123574750.cms,"Florida triple murder convict Curtis Windom (Pic credit: AP)

Florida on Thursday executed Curtis Windom, a 59-year-old inmate convicted of killing his girlfriend, her mother and a man he claimed owed him $2,000.He was sentenced to death for a violent spree on November 7, 1992, in the Orlando area.Windom was pronounced dead at 6:17 pm after receiving a three-drug lethal injection at Florida State Prison near Starke, officials said. This marked a record 11th execution this year by the state of Florida.According to court records, Windom became enraged after learning that Johnnie Lee, who he said owed him $2,000, had won just $114 at a greyhound racetrack. Telling a friend that “you’re gonna read about me,” he bought a .38-caliber revolver and ammunition from a Walmart. He tracked down Lee, shooting him twice in the back from his car before firing twice more at close range. He then drove to his girlfriend Valerie Davis’ apartment, fatally shooting her “without provocation” in front of a witness. Windom also wounded another man before encountering Davis’ mother, Mary Lubin, who was rushing to check on her daughter. Lubin was shot dead in her car at a stop sign.Windom received three death sentences for the murders and a 22-year sentence for attempted murder.Davis was the mother of his daughter, Curtisia Windom, who this week joined an anti-death penalty group in urging Governor Ron DeSantis to halt the execution. “Forgiveness comes with time, and 33 years is a long time. I, myself, have forgiven my father,” she said, as activists submitted more than 5,000 petition signatures to the governor’s office.His lawyers pursued multiple appeals over the years, arguing he had been represented at trial by an incompetent lawyer who failed to investigate mental health issues. The Florida Supreme Court dismissed the claims, ruling prosecutors would have countered with damaging evidence, including allegations that Windom was a drug dealer and that Davis and Lubin were police informants.The US Supreme Court rejected his final appeal on Wednesday, clearing the way for DeSantis, who had signed his death warrant on July 29, to proceed.Windom became the 30th person executed in the United States in 2025, with Florida leading the tally after a flurry of death warrants signed by DeSantis. The state’s previous annual record was eight executions in 2014.A 12th execution is already scheduled for September 17, when David Joseph Pittman, 63, convicted of killing three members of his estranged wife’s family in Polk County in 1990, is set to die.","Curtis Windom, 59, was sentenced to death for killing his girlfriend, her mother and a man he claimed owed him $2,000.

Federal official assault: Man who threw sandwich charged with misdemeanour; felony charges dropped,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/federal-official-assault-man-who-threw-sandwich-charged-with-misdemeanour-assault-felony-charges-dropped/articleshow/123575156.cms,"Federal official assault: Man who threw sandwich charged with misdemeanour assault

Federal prosecutors have reduced charges against a man who threw a sandwich at a federal officer in Washington, after a grand jury refused to indict him on a felony assault count.Sean Charles Dunn, 37, a former justice department paralegal, went viral earlier this month after being filmed hurling a footlong submarine sandwich at a Customs and Border Protection officer near 14th and U streets.The video showed him shouting “fascists” and telling officers, “I don’t want you in my city!” before tossing the sandwich at one of them.Prosecutors initially pursued felony assault, which carries up to eight years in prison. However, grand jurors declined to return an indictment this week, prompting the US attorney’s office to refile the case as a misdemeanour charge of simple assault, punishable by up to one year behind bars, reported The New York Times.The failure to indict was striking given the near-automatic nature of the grand jury process. A well-known legal adage says prosecutors could “indict a ham sandwich.” Yet, in recent weeks, Washington jurors have rejected multiple felony cases linked to US President Donald Trump’s deployment of federal agents and National Guard troops in the capital.According to news agency AP, the Trump administration had spotlighted Dunn’s arrest, releasing a heavily produced video of armed officers arriving at his flat.Washington’s top prosecutor, Jeanine Pirro, also promoted the felony charge in a social media clip, quipping: “So there, stick your subway sandwich somewhere else.”Dunn, swiftly dismissed from his justice department role by attorney general Pam Bondi, has since been labelled “Sandwich Guy” by sections of the media and embraced by supporters as a symbol of pushback against Trump’s federal policing surge.As per AP, prosecutors faced another setback earlier this week when three separate grand juries refused to indict a woman accused of assaulting an FBI agent during an immigration protest. Her case, too, was downgraded to a misdemeanour.Judges have also expressed scepticism about some of these prosecutions. Magistrate Judge Zia M. Faruqui, in a separate case involving lawyer Paul Bryant, criticised prosecutors for detaining him, saying their request had “close to zero” chance of success.","Sean Charles Dunn, 37, was filmed hurling a footlong submarine sandwich at a Customs and Border Protection officer in Washington.

Firefighters detained by US border agents: Two held while battling Washington blaze; ‘immoral’ Donald Trump policy slammed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/firefighters-detained-by-us-border-agents-two-held-while-battling-washington-blaze-immoral-donald-trump-policy-slammed/articleshow/123574560.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: AP)

Two firefighters working to contain a wildfire in Washington state’s Olympic Peninsula were detained by US Border Patrol agents during an immigration enforcement operation, prompting widespread criticism from lawmakers and state officials.According to news agency Associated Press, the workers were part of a 44-person contract crew assigned to the Bear Gulch Fire when federal agents carried out identity checks on Wednesday.Authorities said two men were found to be in the United States illegally, with one facing a prior removal order.Both were taken into custody on charges of illegal entry and re-entry. The Bureau of Land Management subsequently terminated contracts with two Oregon-based firms, Table Rock Forestry and ASI Arden Solutions, and escorted the remaining 42 workers off federal land.The operation unfolded while crews were tackling the Bear Gulch Fire, which has burned about 14 square miles of forest and was 13 per cent contained by Thursday afternoon.Witnesses cited by the Seattle Times said that the firefighters were lined up and ordered to show identification, and were barred from saying goodbye to their detained colleagues. One firefighter was quoted as saying, “You risked your life out here to save the community.This is how they treat us.”The detentions provoked sharp responses from Washington Senator Patty Murray, who branded the Trump administration’s approach to immigration “fundamentally sick.”As per The Guardian, she said: “Here in the Pacific Northwest, wildfires can, and have, burned entire towns to the ground. This new Republican policy to detain firefighters on the job is as immoral as it is dangerous.”Washington Governor Bob Ferguson also said he was “deeply concerned” and has demanded further information from federal agencies. Commissioner of Public Lands Dave Upthegrove added that the actions had stoked fear and mistrust at a time when firefighters were risking their lives.As per news agency AFP, agents held the crews for several hours and prohibited them from filming the encounter. US Customs and Border Protection later defended the move, saying it was carried out at the request of land management officials and highlighted interagency coordination.As per AP, chief patrol agent Rosario Vasquez stated, “US Border Patrol steadfastly enforces the laws of the United States and unapologetically addresses violations of immigration law wherever they are encountered.”Lawyers with Innovation Law Lab, representing one of the detained men, alleged he was unlawfully held and denied access to counsel. “We demand that they allow him to access counsel as is his right afforded by the US Constitution,” lawyer Rodrigo Fernandez-Ortega was quoted as saying by AP.The US Forest Service confirmed it was aware of the Border Patrol’s activity but stressed that firefighting progress at Bear Gulch was not disrupted.","Two firefighters working to contain a wildfire in Washington state were detained by US Border Patrol agents during an immigration enforcement operation.

USA Today

US Vice President JD Vance has pushed back against swirling speculation over President Donald Trump’s health, insisting that the 79-year-old leader remains in “incredible” condition and full of energy.“The president is in incredibly good health,” Vance toldon Wednesday. “He’s got incredible energy. I feel very confident he is in good shape, will serve out the remainder of his term and do great things for the American people.”The remarks came amid a social media buzz triggered by viral clips showing a lighter cosmetic patch on Trump’s hand during his recent public appearances, including a visit to the People’s House museum in Washington DC and a FIFA World Cup event.Online remarks suggested possible health concerns, but the White House brushed off the speculation. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt highlighted Trump’s packed schedule of public engagements, stressing that he continues to actively interact with Americans, without directly addressing Donald Trump's hand patch condition.Donald Trump is the oldest person ever sworn in as US president, was 78 when he began his second term in January 2025.JD Vance, at 41, is the third-youngest vice president in US history.When asked if he was prepared to assume the presidency should circumstances demand, Vance said he was ready but reiterated confidence in Trump’s ability to serve.“Yes, terrible tragedies happen,” he said. “But I can’t think of better on-the-job training than what I’ve had in the past 200 days. That said, I believe the president is strong, focused and leading from the front.”Vance also pointed to Trump’s demanding work routine, noting that despite being older than most of his staff, the president is “the last to go to bed, the last making calls at night, and the first up in the morning setting the day’s agenda.”","JD Vance, 41, is the third-youngest vice president in US history.

Blue States vs Donald Trump: 19 Democratic Governors unite against National Guard threat; slam ‘abuse of power’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/blue-states-vs-donald-trump-19-democratic-governors-unite-against-national-guard-threat-slam-abuse-of-power/articleshow/123574074.cms,"File photo: US President Donald Trump (Picture credit: AP)

Nineteen Democratic governors on Thursday issued a rare joint statement denouncing US President Donald Trump’s threat to deploy National Guard troops in major US cities without their consent, describing the move as an “alarming abuse of power. ”The statement, signed by Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, Maryland’s Wes Moore, New York’s Kathy Hochul and nearly every other Democratic governor except those in Arizona, Connecticut, Hawaii and Minnesota, directly challenged Trump’s claim that he could override state authority.“Instead of actually addressing crime, President Trump cut federal funding for law enforcement that states rely on and continues to politicise our military by trying to undermine the executive authority of governors as commanders in chief of their state’s National Guard,” they wrote, according to the New York Times.They added, “Whether it’s Illinois, Maryland and New York or another state tomorrow, the president’s threats and efforts to deploy a state’s National Guard without the request and consent of that state’s governor is an alarming abuse of power, ineffective, and undermines the mission of our service members. This chaotic federal interference in our states’ National Guard must come to an end.”Trump escalated tensions earlier in the week by claiming he had “the right to do anything I want to do” with the Guard, sparking fears among Democratic-led states.In recent months, his administration has already sent troops to Washington, DC, and Los Angeles. As per news agency AP, the department of homeland security also approached Naval Station Great Lakes, north of Chicago, for logistical support in immigration operations, suggesting the city could be next.Local leaders in Chicago said they were not consulted. Mayor Brandon Johnson and Governor Pritzker have vowed to resist, with city officials preparing for potential legal action. Police Superintendent Larry Snelling urged clearer communication to avoid panic, saying, “We don’t want to create chaos on our streets.”The pushback from Democratic governors comes amid rising concerns about militarisation in domestic affairs. Former President Barack Obama warned on X that the erosion of due process and the use of troops on American soil “puts the liberties of all Americans at risk.”Pete Buttigieg, now US transportation secretary, also criticised the idea, noting that Naval Station Great Lakes was never meant for surveillance or enforcement against citizens.Trump, however, has defended his approach, insisting Democratic leaders have failed to control crime. On his Truth Social platform, he wrote, “The people are desperate for me to Stop the crime, something the Democrats aren’t capable of doing.”Despite Trump’s repeated characterisation of Chicago as a “war zone”, city data shows violent crime has fallen sharply. According to AP, in the first half of 2025, total violent crime dropped by more than 22 per cent compared with the same period in 2024. Still, with 573 homicides last year, Chicago recorded more killings than any other US city.Governor Pritzker has argued there is no emergency justifying military intervention, accusing Trump of pursuing a political agenda ahead of the 2026 elections. “This is a part of his plan to do something really nefarious, which is to interfere with elections,” Pritzker was quoted as saying by AP.","US President Donald Trump has threatened to deploy National Guard troops in major US cities without their consent. 19 Democratic governors on Thursday issued a rare joint statement denouncing the move as an “alarming abuse of power” The statement was signed by Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, Maryland’s Wes Moore, New York’S Kathy Hochul and nearly every other Democratic governor.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123574124,imgsize-956271,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-85.jpg"

Details of the sunspot activity

On Tuesday evening, several of the year’s largest sunspots were spotted in the skies above Arar, drawing attention from astronomers to their size, visibility, and potential effects on Earth.Members of the Space and Astronomy Club confirmed that the sunspots visible this week included spots 4195, 4197, and 4199, each among the most significant recorded in 2025. According to club member Adnan Khalifah, these are temporary dark regions on the Sun’s surface formed by magnetic activity. Though they appear darker, they still emit light and remain highly radiant.Each sunspot observed measures tens of thousands of kilometers in diameter, with several exceeding the size of Earth multiple times over. They were visible through small telescopes equipped with safe solar filters, allowing both professional and amateur astronomers to track the phenomenon.Experts explained that sunspot activity is linked to solar flares and geomagnetic storms, which can interfere with satellite navigation systems and global communications. Monitoring these changes is critical to understanding the Sun’s 11-year solar cycle, which influences the frequency and intensity of such disturbances.Astronomers further emphasized that public observation and amateur contributions are essential, as they not only add to monitoring efforts but also encourage broader scientific awareness and interest in space research.","Sunspots 4195, 4197, and 4199 are among the most significant recorded in 2025.

A strategic start to Hajj 1447

Saudi Arabia has officially begun preparations for the 1447 AH (2026) Hajj season, just weeks after the conclusion of Hajj 2025. A high-level coordination meeting in Makkah, led by top regional officials and involving over 40 agencies, marked the launch of planning efforts aimed at enhancing services, integrating operations, and adopting technology to improve the pilgrim experience.Deputy Emir of Makkah, Prince Saud bin Mishaal bin Abdulaziz, officially inaugurated a high-level panel meeting focused on preparations for the 1447 AH Hajj season. The session took place on Wednesday and was held under the patronage of Prince Khalid Al-Faisal bin Abdulaziz — Advisor to the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, Governor of Makkah Region, and Chairman of the Permanent Committee for Hajj and Umrah.Organized jointly by the Principality of Makkah Region and the Hajj Projects Management Office under the Pilgrim Experience Program — a key component of Saudi Vision 2030 — the meeting signals the beginning of strategic planning for the 2026 pilgrimage.The initiative follows the Kingdom’s long-standing practice of initiating preparations immediately after the conclusion of the previous Hajj season.The meeting’s discussions drew heavily on the operational outcomes of the 1446 AH (2025) Hajj season.

Susan Monarez has resigned as director of the US centers for disease control and prevention (CDC) just weeks after formally assuming the role, The New York Times reported, citing sources familiar with the matter.Monarez, an infectious disease researcher and the first non-physician to lead the agency in over 50 years, reportedly stepped down following disagreements with health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr, particularly over changes to the CDC's vaccine advisory panel.According to individuals who spoke to the portal on the condition of anonymity, Monarez had clashed with Kennedy over his decision to remove and replace members of the influential immunization policy committee with individuals critical of existing vaccine guidelines.Her short tenure coincided with significant restructuring at the CDC, including workforce reductions, budget cuts, and the elimination of some core agency functions. She had previously served as acting director since President Donald Trump took office and was confirmed after the president withdrew his earlier nominee, Dr. David Weldon.Dr. Monarez was reportedly required to coordinate policy decisions with both Matt Buckham, chief of staff at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and Matt Buzelli, chief of staff at the CDC.Last week, HHS appointed a vocal critic of COVID-19 vaccines to lead a subcommittee on vaccine safety, sparking concern among public health professionals. Meanwhile, CDC employees issued an open letter urging Kennedy to stop promoting what they called ""inaccurate information"" about vaccines.Monarez appeared to support their concerns, expressing worry about misinformation in an internal note, though without directly naming Kennedy.She had also received praise from CDC staff for her empathetic leadership following a recent shooting at the CDC’s Atlanta headquarters, in which a gunman—believed to be motivated by anti-vaccine beliefs—killed a police officer and fired on the building.As of now, no official comment has been provided by the department of health and human services.","Susan Monarez, an infectious disease researcher and the first non-physician to lead the agency in over 50 years, reportedly stepped down following disagreements with health secretary Robert F.

US restaurant chain Cracker Barrel announced Tuesday it will restore its original logo after a week-long backlash from customers and political leaders, including President Donald Trump, who criticised its recent rebrand.The Lebanon, Tennessee-based chain confirmed in a statement on its website that it would keep its traditional emblem featuring an elderly man in overalls, known as “Uncle Herschel,” sitting next to a barrel alongside the words “Old Country Store.” “We thank our guests for sharing your voices and love for Cracker Barrel. Our new logo is going away and our ‘Old Timer’ will remain,” the company said.The controversy began last week when Cracker Barrel introduced a simplified text-only design as part of an effort to modernise its 660 restaurants across 43 states and appeal to younger customers.However, the shift sparked a culture war backlash online, with critics branding the move “woke.”The company’s shares, which had slumped after the rebrand, rebounded following the announcementOn Monday, Cracker Barrel issued an apologetic statement saying it “could have done a better job sharing who we are and who we’ll always be.” By Tuesday morning, Trump weighed in on Truth Social, urging the chain to revert to its old design, describing customer feedback as “the ultimate Poll.”Hours later, the company confirmed the reversal.Trump celebrated the decision, writing: “Congratulations ‘Cracker Barrel’ on changing your logo back to what it was. All of your fans very much appreciate it. Good luck into the future. Make lots of money and, most importantly, make your customers happy again!”As per ABC News, Cracker Barrel stressed it would continue honouring its long-standing traditions, including the porch rocking chairs and menu favourites tied to Uncle Herschel’s legacy. “At Cracker Barrel, it’s always been – and always will be – about serving up delicious food, warm welcomes, and the kind of country hospitality that feels like family,” the company said.The White House also joined the mockery by sharing a spoofed logo on X with a caption “Go woke, go broke”. The image shared featured Trump in place of Uncle Herschel with the words “America First” and the slogan “AMERICA IS BACK.”Despite CEO Julie Masino’s earlier defence of modernisation, Cracker Barrel’s climbdown reflects the strength of its loyal customer base. The chain said its 70,000 employees now look forward to “welcoming you to our table soon.”","US restaurant chain Cracker Barrel announced Tuesday it will restore its original logo after a week-long backlash.

Russia surveillance drones fly over US weapons routes?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/russia-surveillance-drones-fly-over-us-weapons-routes/articleshow/123574827.cms,".

Russia or its proxies are flying surveillance drones over routes that the US and its allies use to ferry military supplies through eastern Germany, collecting intelligence that could be used to bolster the Kremlin's sabotage campaign and assist its troops in Ukraine, according to US and other Western officials. US and German officials have been discussing Russian sabotage efforts, including information that led to the arrest of three Ukrainian men accused in a Russia-linked plot, the officials said.The Russian sabotage campaign has led to fires at warehouses in Britain, an attack against a dam in Norway, attempts to cut cables under the Baltic Sea and an array of operations intended to bring the war in Ukraine closer to the heart of Europe and to undermine support for Kyiv.After hitting a high last year, Russian sabotage acts have fallen off significantly this year, experts and Western intelligence officials said. That is at least partly the result of heightened security in Europe, and efforts by US and European intelligence services to prevent attacks.The drop also likely reflects a swirl of diplomatic activity to negotiate an end to the fighting in Ukraine. ""The landscape is more difficult for Russians to operate,"" said Seth Jones, who studies the issue for the Center for Strategic and International Studies.""But it's not unreasonable to assume the Russians are a bit more cautious now while there are negotiations.""Jones noted in a report that Russian attacks in Europe quadrupled between 2022 and 2023, then tripled again between 2023 and 2024. But he tracked a significant drop-off in the first six months of this year, with only four incidents qualifying as sabotage or attempted sabotage by Russia.US spy agencies have been providing information to European govts about potential sabotage actions, according to people briefed on the discussions. US officials confirmed the flights but said they were unable to track their origin. They believe the drones have been flown by Russians or people working for Russian intelligence services.Asked about the report by journalists, Russian spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that ""it's hard to imagine, because then the Germans would have seen it clearly, and they would hardly have kept quiet. So, of course, all this looks more like another newspaper fake.""","Russia or its proxies are flying surveillance drones over routes that the US and its allies use to ferry military supplies through eastern Germany.

White House says new CDC director fired but she refuses to leave,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/white-house-says-new-cdc-director-fired-but-she-refuses-to-leave/articleshow/123574803.cms,".

The White House said late Wednesday that it had fired Susan Monarez, the new director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, after a tense confrontation in which health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. tried to remove her from her position. A lawyer for Monarez said in response that she was refusing to step down.Monarez, an infectious disease researcher, was sworn in just a month ago by Kennedy, but had clashed with the secretary over vaccine policy, people familiar with the events said. Four other high-profile CDC officials quit en masse, apparently in frustration over vaccine policy and Kennedy's leadership.Because Monarez has been confirmed by the Senate - previous CDC directors were not subject to such confirmation - she serves at the pleasure of the president, and Kennedy likely did not have the authority to dismiss her.A spokesperson for President Donald Trump, Kush Desai, said in an email that Monarez was ""not aligned with the president's agenda of Making America Healthy Again,"" and so ""the White House has terminated Monarez from her position with the CDC.""Shortly past midnight, one of Monarez's lawyers, Mark S Zaid, rejected the firing as ""legally deficient"" because the president did not announce it. Desai did not respond to an email message asking if Trump would do so.Her lawyers had asserted earlier Wednesday that Monarez's situation was symbolic of larger issues. ""It is about the systematic dismantling of public health institutions, the silencing of experts, and the dangerous politicization of science,"" they wrote.The clash between Kennedy and Monarez, which had been brewing for days, burst into public view Wednesday. That afternoon, the department announced that Monarez was ""no longer"" director of the CDC. NYT","Susan Monarez, the new director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has been fired.

‘Poison in mind’: Trump’s crackdown on gender identity; says revise curriculum or face grant cuts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/poison-in-mind-trumps-crackdown-on-gender-identity-says-revise-curriculum-or-face-grant-cuts/articleshow/123572830.cms,"Donald Trump threatens funding cuts to states

The Trump administration among the 40 states has directed the Alabama department of public health (ADPH) to revise its teen sex education curriculum funded under the federal personal responsibility education program (PREP), citing the inclusion of “gender ideology” as outside the scope of the law, within 60 days.In a letter sent to the state, federal officials said Alabama’s current use of PREP funds - totaling $1.8 million annually - must exclude content related to gender identity and pronoun usage, which they say were improperly approved by the previous administration.“The statute neither requires, supports nor authorizes teaching students that gender identity is distinct from biological sex or that boys can identify as girls and vice versa,” the letter said, according to reporting by AL.com.“Thus, gender ideology is outside the scope of the authorizing statute and any expenditures associated with gender ideology are not allowable, reasonable, or allocable to the PREP grant.”Acting assistant secretary Andrew Gradison of administration for children and families, part of the US department of health and human services, in his letters to states said,“Accountability is coming,” Gradison said in a press release.“Federal funds will not be used to poison the minds of the next generation or advance dangerous ideological agendas.“The Trump Administration will ensure that PREP reflects the intent of Congress, not the priorities of the left.”PREP grants are intended to educate adolescents on topics like abstinence, contraception, and the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases. However, current Alabama curriculum materials also include language encouraging educators to ask participants for their pronouns as a way to create “a safe space for transgender or gender nonconforming youth.”“Model what you want participants to say by giving your own pronouns,” the curriculum says.“Some transgender youth might have typical pronouns (he/she/his/her/their) or they might request more creative pronouns such as hir or zir.”It adds, “The simple act of requesting pronouns sends the message that transgender and gender nonconforming youth are welcome and respected in the group.”The federal letter acknowledged that such language had previously been approved but said the “prior administration erred in allowing PREP grants to be used to teach students gender ideology.”It continued, “that approval exceeded the agency’s authority to administer the program consistent with the authorizing legislation as enacted by Congress.”As a result, “Alabama’s current PREP curricula and program materials are out of compliance with the PREP statute and HHS regulations and must be modified,” the letter said.State Senator Chris Elliott, a Republican from Baldwin County, confirmed that the matter was raised in a recent meeting in Washington with Trump administration officials.“They expressed concern about the Alabama department of public health's use of PREP funds,” Elliott told AL.com, noting that the concerns were part of a broader discussion around diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts and the creation of the Alabama office of minority affairs.",Alabama is one of 40 states that receive funds from the federal personal responsibility education program (PREP) Federal officials say Alabama’s current use of PREP funds - totaling $1.8 million annually - must exclude content related to gender identity and pronoun usage.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123572847,imgsize-814322,width-400,resizemode-4/donald-trump-threatens-funding-cuts-to-states.jpg"
Minneapolis church shooting: Kennedy flags ‘black box’ psychiatric drugs; trans meds under scrutiny for violence link,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/minneapolis-church-shooting-kennedy-flags-black-box-psychiatric-drugs-trans-meds-under-scrutiny-for-violence-link/articleshow/123572410.cms,"RF Kennedy (left), Robin Westman (AP)

US health and human services secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr has announced that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is launching formal studies into whether psychiatric medications - particularly SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) - and other drugs associated with gender transition could be linked to violent behavior, reported News3.The announcement came during an interview on Fox News following a tragic school shooting in Minnesota this week, where a 23-year-old shooter identified as transgender and left behind a manifesto describing years of depression and suicidal ideation.“We are doing those kinds of studies now,” Kennedy told host Brian Kilmeade. “At NIH we're launching studies on the potential contribution of some of the SSRI drugs and some of the other psychiatric drugs that might be contributing to violence. You know, many of them on there have black box warnings that warn of suicidal ideation and homicidal ideation. We can't exclude those as a culprit, and those are the kind of studies that we're doing. ”The shooter, Robin Westman, reportedly left a manifesto written in Russian Cyrillic script detailing struggles with gender identity, mental health, and a belief they were terminally ill.“I am severely depressed and have been suicidal for years,” Westman wrote, according to The New York Post.While Westman’s prescription history remains unclear, the incident has renewed public scrutiny around psychiatric medications.This is the second case of a transgender individual involved in a school shooting in the past two years.SSRIs like Lexapro and Zoloft - commonly prescribed for depression - are known to carry black box warnings about increased risks of suicidal thoughts and aggressive behavior in individuals under 25. According to past NIH studies, these medications, along with Varenicline, have been among the drugs most frequently associated with violence towards others.Kennedy’s remarks suggest the Trump administration’s health agencies are taking a broader look at the psychiatric drug landscape, including medications used in gender transition therapies, though no specific drug or patient group has been directly linked to the Minnesota case.","The announcement came during an interview on Fox News following a tragic school shooting in Minnesota this week.

The White House on Thursday clarified that US President Donald Trump is not increasing the number of student visas for Chinese nationals, countering recent speculation over a supposed expansion in student entries.“President Trump isn’t proposing an increase in student visas for Chinese students. The 600k number refers to two years’ worth of visas. It’s simply a continuation of existing policy,” reported Fox News, citing a White House spokesperson.The clarification comes amid rising political backlash online and from some conservative commentators, who interpreted the 600,000 figure as a sign of a significant increase in student visa allocations.The controversy had erupted after Trump said, “we're going to allow their students to come in. It's very important, 600,000 students. It's very important. But we're going to get along with China.”The topic sparked criticism from segments of Trump’s support base, who argued that such a move would be inconsistent with the administration’s broader stance on reducing dependence on China, and also a significant departure from previous restrictive immigration and visa policies.Currently, over 270,000 Chinese students are studying in universities across the US, under existing visa frameworks. The 600,000 figure, the White House said, reflects a two-year cumulative count and does not indicate any policy shift or expansion.The clarification comes amid ongoing trade negotiations between Washington and Beijing, where educational exchanges remain one of the discussion points.The statement reaffirmed that there has been no increase in the number of visas issued under the current administration, and the visa policy remains unchanged.","The White House has clarified that US President Donald Trump is not increasing the number of student visas for Chinese nationals.

US President Donald Trump on Thursday escalated his criticism of Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, citing a fresh spike in gun violence in Chicago and suggesting federal intervention may be necessary if local authorities fail to act.It comes after Trump issued threats to deploy federal troops in America’s third-largest city, to bring down crime.Posting on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump wrote, “Governor Pritzker had 6 murders in Chicago this weekend. 20 people were shot. But he doesn’t want to ask me for help. Can this be possible? The people are desperate for me to STOP THE CRIME, something the Democrats aren’t capable of doing.”The statement follows recent federal law enforcement deployments in cities such as Washington, DC, under Trump’s national anti-crime initiative. These surges involve coordination between federal task forces, immigration and customs enforcement (ICE), and local police, aimed at addressing violent crime and repeat offenders.Trump has repeatedly accused Democratic leaders of failing to address crime in major cities, saying his administration is stepping in where local governments have ""lost control.""His broader messaging continues to frame the issue as a partisan failure, claiming that Democratic-run cities are unable to maintain law and order, branding them incapable of doing so.The current approach, however, has drawn criticism from city officials and civil rights groups, who argue that the presence of out-of-state federal officers - particularly ICE agents - can undermine community trust, especially in immigrant neighborhoods.In DC, mayor Muriel Bowser has raised concerns over masked agents participating in local enforcement, saying it creates confusion and fear among residents. She went on to say that immigrants in the city are living in terror.Trump has also issued similar warnings to officials in Philadelphia, Atlanta, and other cities with persistent crime rates. While he has not confirmed whether Chicago is next in line for a federal deployment, his remarks suggest it remains under consideration.Governor Pritzker is yet to respond to Trump’s comments.

As US President Donald Trump’s federal law enforcement surge nears the end of its third week in Washington, DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser has publicly voiced concern over the growing anxiety among residents - especially in immigrant communities.While Bowser acknowledged that the increased federal presence has helped push crime trends in a positive direction, she criticised the role of masked ICE agents and out-of-state national guard troops operating in the city, according to a report by WTOPnews.“There’s tremendous anxiety in the District,” Bowser said at a recent press conference. “When I look and I see residents putting things on social media or neighborhood chats, I know that there is a lot of anxiety. There’s a lot of anxiety with kids going back to school,” as quoted by the portal.The Mayor specifically referred to a recent incident reported by the news agency AP, where federal officers made an arrest near Bancroft Elementary School in Mount Pleasant, prompting chants from residents. Some of the officers reportedly had their faces covered, further intensifying public fear.Bowser confirmed to the portal that US immigration and customs enforcement (ICE) agents have been riding along with DC police officers during traffic stops, particularly those involving mopeds.However, the city, she said, has no access to information about who ICE detains.“I am concerned, for sure, because we think anything that we do and anything that we’re going to ask federal partners to do is focused on violent crime,” she said.DC is home to many residents with temporary protected status, and Bowser warned that the current enforcement approach risks alienating both documented and undocumented individuals.“Whether you have documents or you’re undocumented, you almost feel like you’re being caught up in a dragnet, and that is horrible,” she said. To Hispanic workers living in fear, she added: “I would express to them as a neighbor how very sorry I am that they’re living in this terror,” the mayor was quoted.Police chief Pamela Smith also acknowledged the hesitation among residents to reach out for help due to fear. Deputy mayor for public safety and justice Lindsey Appiah reiterated the city’s appeal: “We do want people to continue to call when they need help.”The federal deployment is currently set to end on September 10 unless President Trump seeks congressional approval for an extension. Bowser said the city would be ready to work with federal resources differently once the 30-day period ends.“We will be prepared to take advantage of additional federal officers to focus on beautification, to support the federal task force, when that time period expires,” she said.Despite tensions, crime in the city is reportedly down compared to the same period last year. Bowser also emphasised the need to strengthen DC’s police force by hiring 500 more officers to reach a 4,000-member target over the coming years.",DC Mayor Muriel Bowser has publicly voiced concern over the growing anxiety among residents - especially in immigrant communities.

AMRITSAR: Embarrassed by a viral video showing its side of the parade path at Wagah border badly waterlogged - and its Rangers standing in knee-deep water - while the Indian side looks clean, Pakistan has blamed the elevation of Grand Trunk Road on the Indian side for the mess.The fact is India has already implemented a rainwater harvesting system and improved drainage management to prevent waterlogging.Pakistan is battling severe floods after relentless heavy rain over the past few days. Its side of the parade area at the site of the daily flag ceremony at the Wagah joint checkpost is wallowing in muddy knee-deep water. Sandbags are seen piled up at a few places on the Pakistani side ahead of the ceremony. In contrast, the Indian side is free of water, except for a small area near the international border gates.Sources say Pakistan has raised the elevation of GT Road with Indian authorities. Pakistan also hastily constructed drainage channels and elevated a portion of the road to facilitate water outflow. BSF IG, Punjab Frontier, Atul Fulzele said there was incessant and heavy rainfall on Aug 8-9, and the video was likely from that period.""There has been no waterlogging at any of the three sites of the ceremonial flag-lowering ceremonies - Attari, Hussainiwala, and Sadqi. "" However, several border outposts (BoPs) along the Punjab Frontier were inundated due to heavy rainfall, and some had to be evacuated, he said.BoPs located in enclaves beyond the Ravi river and short of the international border are also being evacuated due to severe flooding.","Pakistan is battling severe floods after relentless heavy rain over the past few days.

Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Big Op Sindoor Lie Claims India Begged For Ceasefire, Trump Stepped In





ISLAMABAD: Nearly 100 days after Indian fighter jets pounded “terror bases” in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), local police said they have arrested a man who allegedly passed on the GPS coordinates of a mosque that was among those hit.The May 6 raids had left the Bilal Mosque in Muzaffarabad badly damaged, with three fatalities reported. Now, PoK police say Obaid Jahangir of Rawalakot “sold out” by sharing its exact GPS location with India over WhatsApp, allegedly for money.Obaid has been booked under the draconian Official Secrets Act, 1923, with police claiming they had recovered “hard evidence” of espionage. “He passed on sensitive images and the mosque’s coordinates in exchange for hefty payments,” claimed SSP Riaz Mughal of PoK police’s counter-terrorism department (CTD).But the case is already mired in conflicting narratives. Another senior CTD officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, went further, alleging Jahangir had a past with a banned outfit before joining a so-called relief organisation. Investigators, he added, had traced communications with Indian handlers on his phone.The family, however, insists Obaid is no militant. His uncle admitted the 30-something may have “fallen into a money trap” but stressed he was only associated with the Jammu Kashmir United Movement, a relief body.“If he is guilty, he should face the law, but he has never been part of any militant outfit,” the uncle maintained.His lawyer, Abdul Samad, pointed out that the sections invoked against him cover trespassing into restricted areas and passing on information “prejudicial to national security”. Conviction under these clauses carries punishments ranging from 14 years in prison to life.Earlier this year, too, PoK police had arrested a police constable on charges of selling sensitive information across the border.","Indian fighter jets pounded ‘terror bases’ in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) Nearly 100 days later, local police said they have arrested a man who allegedly passed on the GPS coordinates of a mosque.

Fourteen at Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Trauma Centre,” adding that the warehouse had been storing firecrackers.Karachi traffic police said MA Jinnah Road had been closed due to the fire, with traffic from Numaish being diverted towards Society Signal and Ali Raza Imambargah.Citizens were advised to call the Traffic Police helpline at 1915 for alternate routes “to avoid inconvenience,” the Dawn reported.Sindh CM Murad Ali Shah took notice of the incident and directed officials to control the blaze and ensure no lives were lost. According to a statement, he also ordered the Karachi Commissioner to provide immediate medical assistance to the injured and submit a detailed report. “There is no permission to produce materials near cities or populated areas which can cause damage,” CM Murad was quoted as saying.The Sindh home ministry later issued a statement saying 20 people had been injured in the blaze.Home minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar directed police reinforcements to the scene, saying, “Police reinforcements should be sent to rescue the injured and transfer them quickly to the nearest hospital. An investigation must be completed and a report submitted soon.”Lanjar also instructed investigators to include statements from the injured and evidence from the scene, Dawn furthed added.Explosions at fireworks facilities are not uncommon in Pakistan. In January, six people were killed in a similar blast at a fireworks storage site in Mandi Bahauddin, Punjab province. Fires in commercial and residential buildings are also frequent, largely blamed on poor infrastructure, weak enforcement of safety rules, and negligence.","At least 25 people, including some in critical condition, injured after explosion at fireworks storage facility in Karachi, Pakistan.

Targeting Ahmadiyya community



Blasphemy accusations







The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan has raised alarm over violence against minority communities in the country.HRCP on Thursday released its latest report, Streets of Fear: Freedom of Religion or Belief in 2024/25, documenting violations of freedom of religion or belief (FORB) between 1 July 2024 and 30 June 2025.The report painted a picture as grim as in previous years, recording targeted killings, forced conversions, mob lynchings, hate speech, desecration of places of worship and extrajudicial killings. It also warned that religious freedom in Pakistan is facing an unprecedented threat.The HRCP highlighted several cases where individuals were killed over blasphemy accusations, describing the trend as deeply troubling in a country that has already witnessed the assassination of a provincial governor by his own security guard.The HRCP report noted that the pattern of minor non-Muslim girls disappearing and later resurfacing after allegedly converting to Islam and marrying Muslim men persisted in 2024/25.Hindus in Sindh, who form 8.8% of the population, and Christians in Punjab (1.9%), have raised repeated concerns. A fact-finding study found that forced conversions and coerced marriages remain most prevalent among Scheduled Caste Hindus due to poverty and limited social mobility.The report highlighted the role of cleric-politician Mian Abdul Haq, or Mian Mithu, accused of using his influence to facilitate conversions at his seminary in Ghotki. He was sanctioned by the UK in 2022.The report also cited cases where police were seen siding with abductors, often claiming it would be “haram” to return a girl after conversion.In July 2024, Faisalabad police recovered Christian minor Laiba Suhail, abducted in February and forcibly converted before being married off illegally. Another girl, Alina, is still missing. In January 2025, a Mirpurkhas court heard a plea from a couple accused of forcing an underage Hindu girl to convert and marry.Other cases were reported across provinces: in April 2025, 14-year-old a Hindu girl, Chahat disappeared in Quetta and later claimed in a video to have converted, though her parents produced documents proving she was underage.In May, Hindu Panchayats in Ghotki and Rohri protested the disappearance of a Meghwar teenager in Rohri, fearing abduction for forced conversion. In June, civil society groups and Hindu Panchayats in Larkana expressed concern over three minor girls and a teenage boy from Shahdadpur allegedly being forced to convert.The HRCP stressed that such cases continue to deepen insecurity among religious minorities and called for protective measures to safeguard vulnerable children and their families.The report listed multiple killings of Ahmadis: dentist Zakaur Rahman in Lalamusa (July 2024), Tayyab Ahmad in Rawalpindi (December 2024), Amir Hasan in Naukot (December 2024), Laeeq Cheema lynched in Karachi (April 2025), Muhammad Asif in Kasur (April 2025), and senior doctor Mahmood Sheikh in Sargodha (May 2025).The UN warned, “We are alarmed by ongoing reports of violence and discrimination against the Ahmadiyya community in Pakistan.”“According to the data provided by the Ahmadiyya community, 29 Ahmadi places of worship were attacked and damaged during the review period,” the report said.It further added that in 26 cases, the demolition was carried out by law enforcement agencies.“These incidents occurred in Okara, Khanewal, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Vehari, Sheikhupura, Gujrat, and Sargodha, among other locations Back in January, a historic Sialkot site linked to Pakistan’s first foreign minister Zafarullah Khan was “reduced to rubble”.The report said that the blasphemy law has been often misused to settle personal scores or seek financial gain in Pakistan, where, a ‘mere accusation of blasphemy can be a death sentence.’In September, last year, two men accused of blasphemy were killed while in police custody less than a week apart. One was inexplicably shot and killed in Mirpurkhas during an alleged police encounter, and the other was killed by a police constable inside a police station in Quetta.On 12 September 2024, constable Saad Khan Sarhadi shot dead Abdul Ali, a blasphemy suspect, inside Quetta’s Cantonment Police Station after mobs from religious parties gathered outside demanding his custody. It marked the first such incident in the city where a serving officer killed a suspect in custody. Days later, Ali’s family pardoned Sarhadi, while lawyers and a JUI-F senator pledged legal support for him.Later, on 17 September 2024, Shahnawaz Kunbhar, a civil hospital employee from Umerkot, fled to Karachi after a cleric accused him of posting blasphemous content. He denied the charge in a video message before being arrested by police, who assured his family of protection. Two days later, police claimed he was killed in an encounter, with officers celebrated as heroes.His family was prevented from burying him by armed mobs, and the body was desecrated. Following outrage from rights groups, a Sindh police inquiry declared the encounter “fake.”The report also showed that the mainstream media largely ignored issues of religious freedom under the period covered. Even the Islamabad High Court’s hearings into the “blasphemy business group,” affecting nearly 400 households and livestreamed for four months, drew little coverage. Likewise, cases of coerced marriages, forced conversions and violence against minorities rarely made headlines.A worrying trend has emerged in Pakistan, where ultra-right-wing groups are exerting growing pressure on the judiciary and elected officials through propaganda and intimidation, it added.","The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan has raised alarm over violence against minority communities in the country.

’14 Pakistani Soldiers Killed’: Baloch Rebels Attack Day After India’s Strike On Terror Hubs | Watch





The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for an attack in Panjgur that left four Pakistan 's army personnel dead. According to BLA spokesperson Jeeyand Baloch, fighters launched a raid in the Surdu area of Panjgur on Tuesday night, eliminating a key operative of the Pakistan army.The statement revealed that Ghulam Sarwar had earlier established and commanded a so-called death squad under the protection of the Pakistani military. This squad, which had been active for years in Gichek and other parts of Panjgur, was later led by his son, Islam Sarwar. The group allegedly supported the army's operations, carrying out targeted killings, enforced disappearances, and other violent acts. In return, the army reportedly allowed them to freely engage in drug trafficking, kidnappings for ransom and extortion through road checkpoints.During the operation, BLA fighters seized three Kalashnikov rifles, an M-4, additional weapons, two vehicles, and three motorcycles from Islam Sarwar's hideout. The site, according to the BLA, also served as a torture chamber, where electric shock devices and other tools of abuse were found. Islam Sarwar was accused of abducting and killing a young man in Panjgur just two months earlier. Jeeyand Baloch warned that the Pakistani army and its allies would be held accountable for crimes against the Baloch people.The BLA's latest offensive is part of the ongoing insurgency in Balochistan , where separatist groups are demanding greater autonomy and recognition of Baloch rights. In recent years, attacks on military and paramilitary forces, along with government facilities, have intensified.Separatist factions argue that the Baloch people face systemic marginalisation and exploitation, despite the province's wealth in natural resources. In response, Pakistan's military has pursued counterinsurgency campaigns to suppress the rebellion. However, human rights groups have repeatedly raised concerns over reports of forced disappearances, extrajudicial killings, and excessive force during these operations.Numerous accounts point to the widespread issue of disappearances, with civilians and activists allegedly detained without due legal process. Rights organisations argue that such tactics fuel fear and deepen mistrust, further straining relations between the Pakistani state and the Baloch population.","Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for an attack in Panjgur that left four Pakistan's army personnel dead.

Maryam Riaz Wattoo, sister of former Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan ’s wife Bushra Bibi, has alleged that Bushra was forced to go on a hunger strike in prison before she was allowed to meet her family, ARY News reported.Both Bushra and Imran are behind bars facing multiple cases of corruption. Since his arrest in 2023, Khan has consistently maintained his innocence, asserting that the charges were fabricated by his opponents to prevent his political comeback.Maryam further claimed that Bushra was being kept in “difficult and unlawful” conditions. She said the ceiling of her cell leaked, the electric board had live current, rats moved around inside, and electricity was cut for up to two days.Speaking on ARY News, Maryam said Bushra was allowed to meet her family only after more than a month of repeated appeals. She said the family was also made to wait outside the jail for hours.Maryam alleged that Bushra’s health has worsened. “She has lost around 15 kilograms and has become very weak,” she said, adding that her sister’s morale remained strong.She also said that Bushra has not been given bail in several cases and has not been allowed to meet her husband, PTI founder Imran Khan.Meanwhile, Dawn reported that Imran Khan has nominated Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PMAP) chairman Mahmood Khan Achakzai as opposition Leader in the national assembly, and Azam Khan Swati as opposition leader in the senate.","Maryam Riaz Wattoo, sister of former Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan ’s wife Bushra Bibi, has alleged that Bushra was forced to go on a hunger strike in prison.

South Korea has enacted nationwide legislation banning smartphone use in school classrooms, with lawmakers passing the bill on Wednesday, August 26, 2025, to address growing concerns about smartphone addiction among students, as per a report by BBC. The measure, approved by 115 out of 163 lawmakers present, aims to improve academic performance and social interactions among children and teenagers, with implementation scheduled for the next school year beginning March 2026.The new legislation comes as South Korean educators, parents, and lawmakers have observed declining academic progress and performance linked to excessive smartphone use in educational settings. The ban encompasses mobile phones and other smart devices within classroom environments.The initiative aligns South Korea with several other nations that have implemented similar restrictions. Countries including Finland and France have established phone bans specifically for younger students, while Italy, the Netherlands, and China have implemented broader restrictions across all school levels.Many South Korean schools had already implemented various forms of smartphone restrictions prior to this nationwide mandate.The new law formalizes these practices and establishes consistent standards across the country's educational institutions.The implementation timeline provides schools and educational authorities several months to prepare for the transition and establish necessary protocols before the law takes effect in March 2026.The ban reflects growing global awareness of smartphone addiction among youngsters and its potential impact on educational outcomes. Educational institutions worldwide are increasingly examining their policies regarding mobile device use in academic settings.","South Korea has enacted nationwide legislation banning smartphone use in school classrooms.

(AP

CHEMMANI: A baby bottle, a squeaky toy and a schoolbag are among items that have surfaced from a mass grave site in Sri Lanka's formerly war-torn northern region, along with 141 human skeletons including some that appear to be of children of different ages.The findings were made at a cremation ground in the Chemmani area near Jaffna town, the cultural heartland of the country's ethnic Tamil minority. But hardly any burials take place here, as Hindus mostly cremate their dead according to religious customs.Excavations have been underway since June, after workers found human remains while digging to build an electric crematorium.A pit test over nine days discovered 19 sets of human remains. Shallow burials of about 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) in a scattered and disorganized manner, and the absence of clothing, indicated the site was a mass grave, according to a report provided to a court in June.Since the area was secured and declared a crime scene that month, a total of 141 skeletons have been discovered within a 165-square-meter (1,776-square-foot) area. About 135 of the bodies had no clothing, and only one set of adult clothing was identified.Tests confirmed that a skeleton found with a schoolbag was that of a girl between 4 and 6 years old. Toddlers' dresses, socks and footwear, tiny bead bangles and a baby powder tray were also recovered.The identities of the dead and the cause and timing of their deaths are all unclear. But many think the victims could be civilians who disappeared during Sri Lanka's civil war, which broke out in 1983 between government forces and ethnic Tamil rebels, who fought to create an independent homeland for the minority group. The war ended in 2009.Several Tamil armed groups and an Indian peacekeeping mission were active in the region over the decades. But attention has focused on the Sri Lankan military, which had a heavy presence for over a decade in Chemmani, as the gateway to Jaffna town.Decades-old confession heightens suspicions A confession made by an army soldier before he was sentenced to death for rape and murder 27 years ago has strengthened suspicions about the site.In 1998, Somaratne Rajapakse along with four alleged accomplices from the military and police were sentenced to death for the gang rape and murder of a schoolgirl and the killing of her mother, brother and a neighbor.The five, who weren't hanged and remain in prison due to a moratorium on executions, have maintained that they were not involved in the rape and murder, but only disposed of the bodies under orders.Rajapakse told the court that he knew where up to 400 bodies were buried in Chammani.""We cannot say exactly who the perpetrators are yet, but the finger points to the (state) army,"" said Brito Fernando, an activist working with the families of people who disappeared during various armed conflicts in Sri Lanka.The area, including the cremation ground, were under Sri Lankan military control from 1996, when it captured Jaffna from the rebels, until after the war ended in 2009. The military operated checkpoints, and anyone who entered or left the area was searched.In 1999, Rajapakse led police to a spot where the schoolgirl, her family and the neighbor were buried and later showed police other places where more remains were found. But the investigations were abruptly stopped.Families want closure Items found at the site were publicly displayed earlier this month in the hope that their owners would be identified, and many people from surrounding villages and beyond visited the site.Amalanathan Mary Calista, whose husband has been missing since 1996 when the military arrested him in their village, said she hoped seeing proof that her husband was dead would bring a sense of closure.""I went there hoping to see at least his clothes. There was a sarong (clothing that wraps around the waist) but it wasn't my husband's. He was wearing a blue sarong at the time. It was disappointing,"" she said.""I only saw the clothing of little children,"" she added, as she wept.She said her husband is among 24 people who never returned home after the military searched their village. Families had tried to block the army vehicles from taking away the detained people, but the authorities pushed them aside with guns and the vehicles sped away, she said.""My wish is that he should be alive and return, but we can do nothing if it is not so,"" she said.""The state army arrested him. They must say that they arrested him and that he died at their hands. They also must pay us compensation,"" she said.Woman recalls military taking her brother and husband away Sivanathan Selvamalar said she watched her younger brother being loaded into a military truck blindfolded during that same raid. Years later, in 2009, her husband was also detained at a checkpoint. He called her to tell her of his arrest and was not heard from again.""We went to see the things, thinking they may have buried people who were arrested around this area, but we saw only the things of little children,"" she said.""We have checked all the prisons but have not found them. When we are told that more than 100 skeletons have been dug out, we fear the worst,"" she added.No children listed in missing person reports A 2003 report by Sri Lanka's Human Rights Commission said it investigated 281 complaints of missing persons from 1990 to 1998. Of these, three were found in prisons and later released, while the rest are still unaccounted for. The report said the military was responsible for 243 cases, while the Tamil Tiger rebels were responsible for 25. The responsibility for 10 others is unknown.No children were listed as missing.Nadesapillai Vithyatharan, the editor of the only newspaper in the region at the time, said several families returned to Jaffna after fleeing into rebel-held territory as the military moved in. Some reportedly went missing after being stopped at checkpoints set up to look for infiltrating rebels, he said.Calls for DNA analysis Although previous investigations stalled, there is hope now that victims will be identified, Fernando said. But he said the government must do more to conduct a credible investigation.""We don't have proper guidelines to investigate the mass graves and have no DNA bank to help with identification,"" said Fernando, adding that the government should fund a DNA bank and enlist international support in the identification of victims.""Only a proper investigation by the government can free its military from suspicion,"" he said.Any direct probe into the military would likely anger Sri Lankan nationalists. Many of the majority ethnic Sinhalese admire the military for winning the civil war.Excavations will continue for 8 more weeks Ground-penetrating radar in other parts of the cremation ground has shown ""soil anomalies ... that are indicative of comparable density of buried skeletal remains,"" according to a report submitted in the Jaffna court last week.The scanned area is three times larger than the site that has been excavated, said Ranitha Gnanarajah, a lawyer monitoring the process. Investigators have requested court approval to continue excavations for eight more weeks, she said.Army spokesman Brig. Waruna Gamage said no one has formally accused the army of responsibility for the mass grave, and if they did they would need to show proof, he said.""The excavations are still ongoing and it is a civil matter belonging to the police and courts,"" Gamage said. ""We will respect the law of the country.""Government forces and the rebels are both accused of committing atrocities amounting to war crimes in the months leading to the end of the civil war in 2009.","A baby bottle, a squeaky toy and a schoolbag are among items that have surfaced from a mass grave site in Sri Lanka's formerly war-torn northern region.

Afghanistan’s water push: Kabul seeks control of rivers; Taliban’s canal projects raise alarms as neighbours fear flow cuts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/afghanistans-water-push-kabul-seeks-control-of-rivers-talibans-canal-projects-raise-alarms-as-neighbours-fear-flow-cuts/articleshow/123342966.cms,"New Canal, Afghan Valley

Climate crisis drives displacement





After decades of war, Afghanistan is moving to assert sovereignty over its water resources, a shift that is testing fragile ties with neighbouring countries.Since taking power in 2021, the Taliban have launched large-scale infrastructure projects, including dams and canals, to harness river flows that spill into Iran, Pakistan, and Central Asia.But as per news agency AFP, these efforts are fuelling disputes, with climate change worsening water shortages across the region.The most contentious initiative is the Qosh Tepa canal, a mega-project designed to irrigate 560,000 hectares of farmland in northern Afghanistan. Experts say it could divert up to 21 per cent of the Amu Darya’s flow, a river already vital for water-stressed Central Asian states. Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, backed by Kazakhstan, have raised alarms that the project could further shrink the Aral Sea and destabilise the region’s water-sharing arrangements, which date back to the Soviet era.Water governance specialist Mohd Faizee cautioned and was quoted by AFP as saying, “No matter how friendly the tone is now, at some point there will be consequences for Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan when the canal starts operating.”Taliban officials, however, insist the canal will not cause significant harm. Project manager Sayed Zabihullah Miri was cited by AFP as saying that the Amu Darya has “an abundance of water, especially when it floods and glacial meltwater flows into it”.They argue the project is critical to boosting food security in a country where climate-driven crop failures and humanitarian crises remain widespread.Iran, Afghanistan’s western neighbour, is the only country with a formal water-sharing treaty, signed in 1973 over the Helmand river. But the accord has never been fully honoured. Tehran frequently accuses Kabul of restricting flows through upstream dams, especially during droughts.The Taliban maintain that water scarcity, worsened by climate change, leaves them unable to release more.A report by the Afghanistan Analysts Network noted that Afghan authorities also believe they have long been denied their fair share of Helmand waters due to poor management and political neglect.Meanwhile, disputes also simmer over the Harirud basin, which flows into Iran and Turkmenistan, where Afghanistan recently inaugurated the Pashdan dam. Analysts say reduced security risks after the war could accelerate such projects, reshaping regional water dynamics.To the east, Afghanistan shares the Kabul river basin with Pakistan, which eventually feeds into the Indus. Unlike Iran, no treaty exists between the two neighbours. While water disputes have not dominated their rocky bilateral relations, Kabul’s attempts to revive old river projects and build new ones could trigger friction.Yet, Afghanistan’s financial struggles and lack of technical expertise mean most large-scale projects will take years to complete. This delay may ease immediate diplomatic concerns, but for Afghans grappling with severe water shortages in the capital and beyond, the wait could deepen suffering.Afghanistan’s water disputes cannot be separated from the worsening climate emergency. According to the UN’s International Organisation for Migration (IOM), nearly five million people were affected by floods, droughts, and other climate shocks in early 2025, with almost 400,000 displaced.“Crop failure, dry pastures and vanishing water sources are pushing rural communities to the edge,” the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation warned in July.Villagers in the north were quoted by AFP as saying that they were pinning hopes on the Qosh Tepa canal to revive farming, though its completion is still more than a year away. In contrast, communities in western Herat have watched the Harirud river run dry, forcing families who were deported from Iran to return to barren land with little to farm.Meanwhile, extreme rainfall has added another layer of crisis. Warmer temperatures mean heavier downpours, often triggering devastating flash floods. In Maidan Wardak, a community leader said, “I’m around 54 years old, and we have never experienced problems like this before.”Taliban officials admit their efforts fall short. Energy and water minister Abdul Latif Mansoor recently conceded that while canal and dam projects are underway, “the measures we have taken so far are not enough”.Limited funding, international isolation and restrictive governance have left Afghanistan struggling to cope with climate shocks, even as it faces one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises.For millions of Afghans, everything now comes down to water, too little in times of drought, too much during floods, as the Taliban’s push for control over rivers becomes a defining issue for the country and its neighbours alike.","Afghanistan is moving to assert sovereignty over its water resources, a shift that is testing fragile ties with neighbouring countries.

Insights from UK’s unlikely ‘Blue Zone’ where people regularly live past 100,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/insights-from-uks-unlikely-blue-zone-where-people-regularly-live-past-100/articleshow/123548599.cms,"Blue Zones and the habits that make them extraordinary



Plymouth: The UK’s healthiest midlifers and their lifestyle patterns

Diet and lifestyle: Key drivers of healthy ageing and longevity



Purpose, relationships, and mental wellness: Building a long, fulfilling life



Midlife clarity: Knowing your health inside out

Practical health steps for midlifers

Exercise snacking: Short bursts of 3–5 minutes of activity during work or daily routines help maintain strength and mobility.

Sleep optimization: Aim for around seven hours of restorative sleep nightly to support cognitive and physical health.

Mindful eating: Focus on a plant-rich diet, follow the 80 percent rule, and avoid overconsumption of processed foods and red meat.

Purpose and social connections: Invest in relationships, community, hobbies, and personal passions to enhance mental wellbeing.

Regular health checks: Utilize midlife health assessments and screenings to detect early changes and maintain control over long-term health.

Lessons from global Blue Zones applied to the UK

By the sea in southwest England, a surprising trend is emerging—residents of Plymouth are living longer, healthier lives than most of their UK peers. According to a Daily Mail report on the Midlife Clarity Index study by Vista Health, Plymouth stands out as the UK city with the healthiest midlifers—people in their 40s, 50s, and 60s who enjoy strong health, low incidence of chronic disease, and overall wellbeing. This mirrors global Blue Zones, such as Okinawa in Japan, Sardinia in Italy, Nicoya in Costa Rica, Ikaria in Greece, and Loma Linda in California, where lifestyle, diet, and community bonds play a decisive role in extended lifespans and higher quality of life.Blue Zones are regions where people consistently live beyond 100 while experiencing lower rates of heart disease, diabetes, and dementia as reported by Daily Mail. Studies of these areas reveal nine shared habits, called the “Power Nine”: consistent physical activity integrated into daily life, diets rich in fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains, moderate alcohol consumption, deep family ties, strong social engagement, stress reduction practices, spiritual or purposeful living, and the avoidance of overeating. These lifestyle habits collectively reduce inflammation, improve gut health, and enhance mental and physical resilience, contributing to longevity and happiness.The Midlife Clarity Index, which surveyed 7,000 adults aged 40 to 65 across 17 UK cities, used metrics such as diet, exercise, alcohol use, stress management, and sleep quality to rank midlife health. Plymouth topped the list thanks to strong scores for daily activity, high intake of fruits and vegetables, and sufficient restorative sleep. Midlifers in Plymouth typically engage in around two hours of exercise weekly—not including walking, gardening, or other routine movement. This combination of plant-rich diet, regular physical activity, and stress management mirrors global longevity practices and positions residents for longer, healthier lives.A plant-focused diet is central to long life, with Blue Zone research showing that beans, legumes, whole grains, and seasonal vegetables form the core of daily meals. Meat is eaten sparingly, often only a few times a month, while the “80 per cent rule” prevents overeating and promotes mindful consumption. As reported by the Daily Mail, Plymouth’s midlifers are increasingly following these principles, boosting gut health, immunity, and reducing inflammation. Combined with gentle but consistent physical activity and seven hours of sleep nightly, these habits strengthen cardiovascular health, support cognitive function, and lower risks of type 2 diabetes, stroke, and other age-related conditions.Longevity is not just about diet and exercise; mental wellbeing and social engagement are equally critical. Health experts quoted by the Daily Mail highlight that maintaining meaningful relationships and investing in community connections can reduce the likelihood of dementia by up to 50 percent and extend life expectancy. Plymouth’s midlifers benefit from strong social networks, hobbies, volunteering, and pursuing passions that provide purpose, mirroring the concept of ikigai from Okinawa, Japan—a reason for being that nurtures both mental and emotional health.Vista Health’s Midlife Clarity Index emphasizes that midlife is the ideal time to take control of your health. In your 40s, 50s, and 60s, your body sends new signals—changes in sleep, energy, stress response, and recovery time—making this the right moment to pause and evaluate wellbeing. Common issues like back pain, knee discomfort, heart or prostate concerns, or unexplained symptoms can be assessed through trusted diagnostic scans and health checks. Vista Health provides private midlife health assessments, from full-body MRI scans to ultrasounds, helping individuals understand risks and take proactive steps before issues become limiting.The study highlights several actionable habits that midlifers can adopt:While the UK has no official Blue Zones, Plymouth demonstrates that adopting the principles of longevity—balanced diet, regular natural movement, social connection, meaningful purpose, and restorative sleep—can significantly improve health outcomes. By integrating these habits into daily life and using tools like Vista Health’s midlife assessments, individuals can reduce health risks, remain mentally sharp, and increase the likelihood of reaching 100. The findings emphasize that longevity is accessible to the broader population, not just elite biohackers or billionaires, and that small, consistent lifestyle choices have a profound impact on wellbeing.","The Midlife Clarity Index surveyed 7,000 adults aged 40 to 65 across 17 UK cities.

in towns like Rotherham and Rochdale, which left many convinced that working-class girls are abandoned by the state. Distrust of authority: The perception that police and courts fail to protect the vulnerable, forcing communities to fend for themselves.

The far-right remix



Who is the man in the video?



He lives in a council property with his wife, Fatos Yulianova, 19, and their eight-month-old baby.

He first worked in a St Andrews restaurant after arriving in Scotland, and has studied English in Wales.

Police Scotland confirmed there is no evidence he committed any offence.

Daily Mail

“I never touched her. I didn’t hit her, I swear on my life. I have a baby now. I would never hurt someone.”

“I am not an illegal migrant. I have not done anything. I am a human not an animal.”

“If I did hurt the girl, why didn’t the police arrest me? They saw from CCTV I was stopped from going to the shop.”

Police response and political pushback



A familiar pattern



The law and the paradox of self-defence



Why it matters



A child in the spotlight: A 12-year-old has been thrust into a national culture war.

Disinformation at scale: Dumana, a young Bulgarian father, was smeared as an “illegal migrant” within hours.

Cultural resonance: The Braveheart analogy shows how Scotland frames defiance — but reality is more complex.

The risk of unrest: As with Southport, unchecked narratives risk spilling into real-world violence.

The bottom line



On August 23, a clip filmed in Dundee’s Lochee area went viral: a schoolgirl wielding a knife and an axe, shouting at a man while another girl tried to hold her back. Within hours, the footage had been amplified by figures like Tommy Robinson and Elon Musk, who claimed the man was a “migrant” and used the incident to fuel anti-immigration anger. The girl, aged 12, was later charged with possession of offensive weapons.The Dundee video resonated because it carried three explosive elements:For supporters online, the girl was not just a child with a knife — she was a symbol of Britain’s deeper failings.The far-right narrative was quick to take shape: a “native girl” defending her sister from a predatory foreigner. Robinson and Musk implied that the man was fresh off a “small boats” crossing, and online forums branded the girl a modern Braveheart figure, standing against an “alien threat.”The imagery tapped into Scotland’s enduring mythos of defiance — though in reality, this was not a Mel Gibson war epic, but a grim confrontation on a housing estate verge.The man wrongly cast as a migrant predator has now been identified as Fatos Ali Dumana, 21, a Bulgarian national who has lived in Dundee since 2021.Speaking to the, Dumana rejected the claims against him:Police Scotland said the girl has been charged and will be referred to the relevant authorities.They stressed that “misinformation” about Dumana’s status was false. Former Scottish First Minister Humza Yousaf was more blunt, dismissing the far-right framing: “Who would have guessed the far right were full of bulls**.”*The Dundee incident follows a pattern seen before. In Southport in 2024, riots erupted after false claims spread about a stabbing suspect’s identity. The choreography is familiar: partial facts, viral amplification, political reframing — and a local clash becomes a national flashpoint.UK law bans minors from carrying knives. While self-defence is legally recognised, “reasonable force” rarely extends to waving a blade in public.This creates a paradox. In the eyes of the law, the girl is a child charged with a weapons offence. In the eyes of many online, she is a victim forced into self-defence.The grooming gang shadow: Old scandals mean new incidents are viewed through the lens of institutional failure.A Saturday evening confrontation in Dundee has been transformed into a parable of Britain’s anxieties. A child has been charged, while a Bulgarian man — wrongly accused online — insists he has done nothing wrong. The myths travelled faster than the facts, merging grooming gang trauma, immigration fears, and Scottish defiance into a viral storm. The Braveheart echoes explain the emotional charge, but the truth is simpler: a frightened girl, a family man, and a country still fighting its culture wars.","A 12-year-old girl has been thrust into a national culture war.

‘Aided the rape epidemic of their own people’: Elon Musk renews attacks on UK officials over grooming gang scandal; pledges to fund legal action,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/aided-the-rape-epidemic-of-their-own-people-elon-musk-renews-attacks-on-uk-officials-over-grooming-gang-scandal-pledges-to-fund-legal-action/articleshow/123542975.cms,"File photo: Elon Musk (Picture credit: AP)

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has reignited controversy in Britain by calling for prosecutions of officials accused of failing to stop grooming gangs, following fresh claims that child sexual exploitation has taken place across dozens of local authorities.In a post on X, Musk wrote, “Start by condemning the grovelers and collaborators in positions of authority in Britain who aided the rape epidemic of their own people or turned a blind eye to their responsibilities. Both civil and criminal prosecutions.”His comment came in response to a user who shared the photo of a 14-year-old girl arrested in Dundee after allegedly carrying a bladed weapon, as reported by The Courier.The user had claimed teenage girls were resorting to defending themselves from rape, accusing police of failing to protect victims.Earlier, Musk replied to British MP Rupert Lowe, who chairs an unofficial “Rape Gang Inquiry.” Quoting Lowe’s findings, Musk posted: “85 cities in Britain where local authorities were complicit in the rape of children …”Lowe had announced that his inquiry uncovered evidence of gang-based sexual exploitation in 85 local authorities, describing it as “one of the most comprehensive exposés of the rape gang scandal to date.”He said the inquiry had received testimonies from survivors and families, alongside thousands of Freedom of Information requests.Musk has also pledged to fund legal action against “corrupt officials” accused of covering up abuse. In a separate post, he wrote: “I would like to help fund legal actions against corrupt officials who aided and abetted the rape of Britain, per the official government inquiry.”The billionaire later posted an image of the national flag of England, fuelling speculation about his intent to continue intervening in the debate.The issue of grooming gangs has gained renewed prominence since June, when Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer agreed to a government-backed national inquiry, reversing Labour’s earlier stance. Survivors and campaigners have since pressed the government to deliver on promises of justice.Lowe said his team’s research shows the problem stretches back to the 1960s and spans towns and cities across the UK. “The message from survivors is clear: get on with it. There have been too many broken promises,” he said, as cited by The Telegraph.","Tesla CEO Elon Musk has reignited controversy in Britain by calling for prosecutions of officials accused of failing to stop grooming gangs.

LONDON: Indian nationals in the UK saw the largest increase in sexual offence convictions here of all foreign nationals in the four years from 2021 to 2024, new data shows.There was a 257% increase in convictions of Indian nationals for sexual offences in Britain over the period, followed by Nigerian nationals who saw an increase of 166% and Iraqis (160% increase). Indians were convicted of 100 sexual offences in 2024 compared to 28 in 2021.UK’s ministry of justice (MoJ) said the data relates to sentencing occasions rather than individual offenders.The statistics were taken from MoJ data drawn from the Police National Computer and obtained by the think tank Centre for Migration Control via a freedom of information request to the MoJ.Indians had the third-highest increase in convictions for serious offences of all foreign nationals between 2021 and 2024 at 115%, with the second-highest being Algerian, and the highest being Egyptian. There was a total of 588 convictions of Indian nationals for serious offences in 2024 compared to 273 in 2021.This comes as new immigration data released by the home office shows that in 2024 a total of 293 Indian nationals arrived in the UK illegally via small boat and 206 have arrived between Jan and June this year. Indians are a tiny proportion, though, as the largest cohort last year came from Afghanistan, Iran and Syria.Indians made up 15% of illegal arrivals at UK ports in the year ending June 2025 when there were 5,474 asylum applications made by Indian nationals, of which, rounded to the nearest 100, 4,000 were made by those who had come to the UK on a legal visa, mostly study visas, 400 were made by those who came on small boats, and the rest entered through other means. For asylum initial decisions for Indians, 2,691 were refused in the year ending June 2025, while 20 were granted asylum, and the rest are awaiting a decision.Indians were the largest group to gain citizenship and received the highest number of work visas and tourist visas of any nationality in the year ending June 2025.

'I don’t understand Prince Harry’s anger': Butler challenges ‘evil stepmother’ Queen Camilla story — What really happened,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/i-dont-understand-prince-harrys-anger-butler-challenges-evil-stepmother-queen-camilla-story-what-really-happened/articleshow/123525991.cms,"Harry’s Private Note To Late Grandfather Prince Philip Sparks Backlash Online

The simmering tension between Prince Harry and Queen Camilla, long splashed across tabloids, has been reignited, but this time by someone unexpectedly in the middle of royal history. Former royal butler Grant Harrold, who served the monarchy for decades, is challenging the Duke of Sussex’s stark portrayal of his stepmother in his memoir Spare.In the explosive book, Harry branded Camilla “evil” and “wicked,” accusing her of tearing apart the family he cherished with Princess Diana. Yet Harrold’s recollections paint a different picture, one of warmth, laughter, and shared family moments.In his upcoming biography, The Royal Butler: My Remarkable Life of Royal Service, Harrold recounts the day Charles and Camilla wed in April 2005. “Charles and Camilla were catching a flight to head straight to Birkhall. We all went outside to wave them off and laughed as we saw William and Harry had decorated their car with ‘Just Married,’” he writes. He added that the brothers “raced after the car” as the couple drove off “through the arches to cheers,” a scene far removed from the cold animosity Harry described.Harrold insists he witnessed “no animosity” between Harry and Camilla. “The four of them, I promise you, got on so well. I saw them having dinners together, I saw them having drinks together, I saw them going to parties together,” he recalled.He also praised King Charles for his calm demeanor, noting, “He works hard and doesn’t suffer fools… he doesn’t once raise his voice.”A royal insider corroborated Harrold’s account, telling GB News that Harry seemed genuinely happy during the wedding celebrations and even took the lead in decorating his father’s Aston Martin. “I am sure there were mixed emotions over the years, but all I can tell you is how he seemed at the time,” the source said.Yet Harry’s memoir paints a more bitter picture. He claimed Camilla was “dangerous,” accused her of leaking details of his past drug use, and even compared her to the “wicked stepmothers in storybooks.” The stark contrast between Harry’s narrative and those who witnessed the events firsthand has sparked a debate over truth, perception, and memory within the royal family.As Harrold prepares to release his biography, royal watchers are left wondering: did Harry’s version of events obscure a more nuanced reality, or was it a reflection of long-held personal pain?","Former royal butler Grant Harrold is challenging Prince Harry's portrayal of his stepmother in his memoir Spare.

US President-elect Donald Trump appointed Sylvester Stallone Mel Gibson , and Jon Voight as special envoys to Hollywood on Thursday.Trump said that he aims to make the entertainment industry ""stronger than ever before"" with this move. ""It is my honor to announce Jon Voight, Mel Gibson, and Sylvester Stallone, to be Special Ambassadors to a great but very troubled place, Hollywood, California.

Gibson has been accused of anti-Semitism, homophobia, racism, and domestic violence, while Stallone has faced sexual assault allegations, which he has denied.In his official statement, Gibson revealed that the announcement caught him off guard, stating ""at the same time as all of you and was just as surprised. Nevertheless, I heed the call. My duty as a citizen is to give any help and insight I can.""Following the loss of his residence in the Palisades fire, Gibson also humorously enquired, ""Any chance the position comes with an Ambassador's residence?""Traditionally, the entertainment industry has shown limited support for Trump and the Republicans, with many stars backing Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. However, in addition to few Hollywood actors, Trump has managed to tap into a targeted subset of certain YouTube influencers to sidestep Hollywood.","US President-elect Donald Trump appointed Sylvester Stallone Mel Gibson, and Jon Voight as special envoys to Hollywood.

China population shrinks for third year even with more babies born,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/china-population-shrinks-for-third-year-even-with-more-babies-born/articleshow/117317118.cms,"China’s population shrank for the third straight year in 2024, even though births rose slightly, underscoring a persistent long-term risk for the economy.The total number of people in China fell by over 1.39 million to 1.408 billion last year, according to data released by the National Statistics Bureau on Friday.Around 9.54 million babies were born, which is 520,000 more than the year before.This bump might be partly due to the belief that the Year of the Dragon in the Chinese zodiac is lucky for having children. Even so, it was still the second-lowest number of births since the founding of the People’s Republic of China in 1949.“Many couples who delayed childbearing during the three years of the Covid-19 pandemic chose to have babies in 2024 — that is the main cause of the uptick,” said He Yafu, an independent demographer. “But I estimate the number of newborns will drop in 2025.”The annual drop in population shows how the Chinese government has struggled to halt a falling birth rate, the result of decades of restrictive family planning policies, rising childcare costs and changing social norms. The number of newborns has been declining steadily since the 1960s, except for a brief uptick in 2016 as the government relaxed its one-child policy.Bloomberg Intelligence has estimated that China’s population will shrink to 1.36 billion by 2035, a level not seen since 2012, though that may be delayed if couples could be persuaded to have more babies. In October, authorities pledged to better support families with multiple children, including by helping with housing, health care and employment.China’s demographic challenges could eventually hurt the nation’s economic prospects as a shrinking workforce puts a strain on growth. Additionally, an expanding elderly population would pile more pressure on the underfunded pension system.Last year, China said it would gradually raise the retirement age for the first time since 1978, despite the public disgruntlement the decision caused.","The total number of people in China fell by over 1.39 million to 1.408 billion last year.

Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced on Friday that a deal has been reached to secure the release of hostages held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip, following intense negotiations.The agreement, which includes a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of Palestinian prisoners, faced unexpected delays which Netanyahu had attributed to disputes with Hamas.Netanyahu plans to convene his security cabinet on Friday to seek approval for the agreement, after his office cited issues with Hamas reneging on parts of the deal to gain additional concessions.Despite initial optimism surrounding the announcement of the deal by the US President Joe Biden and Qatar as mediators, tensions within Netanyahu's government coalition have complicated the approval process.""Hamas is backing out of the understandings and creating a last-minute crisis that prevents a settlement,"" Netanyahu's office had said on Thursday, without specifying the exact nature of the disagreements.Israeli airstrikes have continued across Gaza, resulting in at least 72 casualties according to Gaza's health ministry. The airstrikes coincided with celebrations among Palestinians over the ceasefire deal.Under the terms of the agreement set to commence on Sunday, 33 hostages are scheduled for release over the next six weeks, in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. The remaining hostages, including male soldiers, will be subject to further negotiations contingent upon a lasting ceasefire and Israeli withdrawal, conditions Hamas insists upon for their release.The agreement comes after weeks of intense violence triggered by Hamas’s October 7 attack on Israel, which left approximately 1,200 Israelis dead. In response, Israeli retaliatory strikes have caused over 46,000 deaths in Gaza, including thousands of women and children, according to Palestinian health authorities. The Israeli military has stated that its operations have killed 17,000 Hamas fighters.The civilian impact has been devastating, with nearly 90% of Gaza’s 2.3 million residents displaced. Much of the region’s infrastructure lies in ruins, forcing hundreds of thousands to seek refuge in precarious, makeshift shelters.","Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced a deal to release hostages held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip.

President Joe Biden will not enforce a ban on the social media app TikTok that is set to take effect on January 19, leaving the decision to President-elect Donald Trump , according to a US official.""Our position on this has been clear: TikTok should continue to operate under American ownership. Given the timing of when it goes into effect over a holiday weekend a day before inauguration, it will be up to the next administration to implement,"" a White House official, speaking anonymously, told ABC NewsThe ban, required by a law signed by Biden last year, mandates that TikTok's China-based parent company ByteDance divest the company by the day before the presidential inauguration.Trump, who previously called for a ban on the app, has since pledged to keep it available in the US, although his transition team has not provided details on how they plan to achieve this.TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew is expected to attend Trump's inauguration and be seated on the dais, signaling that the incoming administration may take steps to prevent TikTok from being shut down. According to ABC News sources, Trump also held discussions with TikTok's Chief Executive Officer Shou Chew at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida last month.Meanwhile, incoming national security adviser Mike Waltz stated that the federal law allows for an extension if a viable deal is on the table. He said, ""If the Supreme Court comes out with a ruling in favor of the law, President Trump has been very clear: Number one, TikTok is a great platform that many Americans use and has been great for his campaign and getting his message out. But number two, he's going to protect their data.""The push to save TikTok has received bipartisan support, with Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer advocating for an extended deadline to find an American buyer and avoid disrupting the lives of millions of Americans and influencers. He said, ""It's clear that more time is needed."".""We will continue to work to find a responsible solution to keeping TikTok going, protect American livelihoods, and protect against Communist Chinese Communist Party surveillance. We must and can do all three,"" he added.Last week, the US Supreme Court heard oral arguments in a legal challenge to the statute brought by TikTok, ByteDance, and users of the app. The Justices appeared likely to uphold the law, which requires ByteDance to divest TikTok on national security grounds or face a ban in one of its biggest markets.Trump, who used TikTok during his 2024 presidential campaign to connect with younger voters, has reversed his position on the app and pledged to ""save TikTok"" during the campaign, crediting the platform with helping him win more youth votes.","President Joe Biden will not enforce a ban on the social media app TikTok that is set to take effect on January 19.

While Xi will not attend in person, Han’s presence underscores China’s interest in maintaining a diplomatic channel amid strained relations.During his first term, Trump waged a trade war against China, imposing significant tariffs on Chinese imports and accusing Beijing of unfair trade practices.

Concerns about health risks



The outgoing Joe Biden government on Wednesday banned Red Dye No 3 , a controversial food colouring long known to cause cancer in animals. The decision comes decades after scientific evidence found the risk and 30 years after it was banned from cosmetics."" FDA is revoking the authorized uses in food and ingested drugs of FD&C Red No. 3 in the color additive regulations,"" the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced on Wednesday.""The FDA is taking action that will remove the authorization for the use of FD&C Red No.3 in food and ingested drugs,"" said Jim Jones, the FDA's deputy commissioner for human foods. “Evidence shows cancer in laboratory male rats exposed to high levels of FD&C Red No.3. Importantly, the way that FD&C Red No. 3 causes cancer in male rats does not occur in humans,"" it said.The move follows California's decision last year to ban four food dyes, including Red 3, and comes amidst increasing pressure to align US regulations with stricter European Union standards.Red 3 has been banned from cosmetics since 1990 due to its carcinogenic effects in animal tests , a decision made under the 1960 Delaney Clause, which prohibits deeming a colour additive safe if it causes cancer in humans or animals. Despite this, the dye remains authorised in food.European countries already require warning labels or ban certain dyes altogether, employing a precautionary approach to consumer safety .The International Association of Color Manufacturers defends the dye, saying that it is safe in levels typically consumed by humans. The group points to research by scientific committees operated by the United Nations and the World Health Organization, including a 2018 review that reaffirmed the safety of Red 3 in food, reported AP. Some food manufacturers have already reformulated products to remove Red 3.","Red Dye No 3 banned from cosmetics since 1990 due to carcinogenic effects in animal tests.

At the time of his arrest, he was flying a Nazi flag.He had planned the attack for weeks before he took a flight from St. Louis to Washington, DC only hours before the crash, prosecutors said. He rented the truck in Herndon, Virginia approximately three hours before he crashed it into the barriers.On May 4, 2023, Kandula attempted to contact several other companies in an attempt to rent a large commercial tractor-trailer truck, a dump truck, or another large truck. Kandula was unsuccessful in arraigning for security guards or a tractor-trailer truck or dump truck. Kandula had attempted to arrange for the services of these security guards and the use of large vehicles in order to carry out his offense against the US government, a media release said.The truck nearly struck two people standing next to a park bench when he steered a U-Haul box truck onto a sidewalk and toward metal bollards that prevent vehicles from entering Lafayette Square, which is located north of the White House. He retrieved a Nazi flag from a backpack after the May 22, 2023, crash, which didn’t injure anybody.According to department of justice, his actions caused USD 4,322 in damage to the National Park Service. This amount included costs for repairing the metal bollard barriers to their original condition and ensuring structural soundness, oil and chemical removal, spill cleanup, and disposal of fluids from the crashed U-Haul.","Sai Varisth Kandula, a 20-year-old Indian national residing in US was sentenced to eight years of jail on Thursday for an attempted attack on the White House with rented truck.

Musk said to have intervened to help free Italian journalist jailed in Iran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/musk-said-to-have-intervened-to-help-free-italian-journalist-jailed-in-iran/articleshow/117315370.cms,"When an Italian journalist was arrested in Iran in Dec, her boyfriend back home feared she might linger in prison for years. So, amid talk that Iran and Italy were negotiating a prisoner swap that involved the US, he says, he decided to try to get a message to someone who might be in a position to help.His name was Elon Musk Not only was Musk close to Prez-elect Donald Trump, but a month before the journalist was detained, the billionaire had a secret meeting with the Iranian ambassador to the UN.Last week, the journalist, Cecilia Sala , 29, was released from prison in Iran, and days later an Iranian engineer whom Italy had detained on an American extradition request was also freed. The engineer was accused of providing material for drones used in an Iranian-backed militia attack on a US military base that killed three American service members. Musk helped secure the release of Sala by reaching out to Iran's ambassador to the UN, Amir Saeid Iravani, according to two Iranian officials, one a senior diplomat at the foreign ministry, who are both familiar with the terms of the prisoner exchange . Neither Musk nor representatives of the Trump transition made comment.How Musk, an increasingly active if uncredentialed player on the world stage since the Trump victory, came to take up the journalist's cause remains unclear. He is close with Italy's PM Giorgia Meloni , who travelled to Mar-a-Lago, the Trump estate in Florida where Musk has been a regular, and met with the president-elect Jan 4.Meloni said at a news conference last week that Sala's release was the result of a ""complex work of diplomatic triangulation with Iran, and obviously also with the USA."" Her office and the Italian foreign ministry declined to comment for this article. A senior Biden official said the US govt had not been consulted, had not been given advance word about the releases and disapproved of the deal.At the presser, Meloni said she did not know what part if any Musk had played in Sala's release. ""If he had a role, I am not aware of it,"" she said. The ambiguity highlights the unusual role Musk has been playing as he sits at Trump's side, backing far-right parties in Europe even as he continues to promote his business interests abroad.Sala said in an interview that she had been held in a cell with no mattress. For weeks, she was denied her glasses, and throughout her detention she did not see a human face. She could hear sounds of other inmates crying and vomiting. What she feared the most, she said, was ""that I would go insane.""","Cecilia Sala, 29, was released from prison in Iran, and days later an Iranian engineer whom Italy had detained on an American extradition request was also freed.

Biden or Trump? A fight for credit kicks off in US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/biden-or-trump-a-fight-for-credit-kicks-off-in-us/articleshow/117315296.cms,"Washington: The long-sought, tortuously negotiated Gaza ceasefire deal announced on Wednesday came about in part through a remarkable collaboration between President Joe Biden and President-elect Donald Trump, who temporarily put aside mutual animosity to achieve a mutual goal. The two presidents directed their advisers to work together to push Israel and Hamas over the finish line for a truce agreement.The deal is set to start Sunday, the day before Biden turns over the White House to Trump.Each president had his own interest in settling the matter before Inauguration Day. For Biden, the deal, if it holds, represents a final vindication on his watch. For Trump, the deal, for now, takes a major issue off the table, freeing him to pursue other priorities. The dramatic development cut against the natural grain in Washington, where presidents of opposing parties rarely work in tandem during a transition. But the political planets quickly returned to their normal orbits as both sides argued over who deserved credit for resolving the standoff.While Biden waited for official word to come from the region, Trump got the jump on him by disclosing the deal himself in an all-caps social media post. ""This EPIC ceasefire agreement could have only happened as a result of our Historic Victory in November,"" he added soon afterward. By the time Biden appeared before cameras at the White House later in the afternoon, he was more gracious, noting that the two teams spoke with one voice. But he bristled when asked who merited credit, him or Trump. ""Is that a joke?"" he asked. He noted that the ceasefire was ""the exact framework of the deal I proposed back in May"".Still, the partnership, awkward and prickly as it was, stood out in an era of deep polarisation. ""It really is extraordinary,"" said Mara Rudman, who was deputy special envoy for Middle East peace under President Barack Obama. ""Everybody's talking about who gets credit, but the fact is that it's shared, and part of the reason it worked is that it's shared.""However credit is ultimately apportioned, diplomats, officials and analysts said it seemed clear that both presidents had played important roles. The deal that was finally agreed to was essentially the same one that Biden had put on the table last May and that his envoys, led by Brett McGurk, his West Asia coordinator, had worked painstakingly to make acceptable to both sides. At the same time, Trump's impending return to office and his threat that ""all hell will break out"" if the hostages were not released by the time he was sworn in clearly changed the calculations of the warring parties.The coming change in political leadership in the US was not the only factor. The situation on the ground has changed dramatically: Israel has decapitated the leadership of Hamas, all but demolished its allied militia Hezbollah in Lebanon and taken out key military facilities in Iran.","The two presidents directed their advisers to work together to push Israel and Hamas over the finish line for a truce agreement.

Poll Do You Believe Diplomatic Talks Can Resolve Tensions Between Neighboring Countries? Depends on the Severity of the Situation Yes, They Can Help Find Peaceful Solutions

Why it matters: Pakistan’s waning influence on Taliban

This burgeoning relationship comes at a time of growing tension between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Islamabad, once a staunch ally of the Taliban, now finds itself at odds with Kabul over issues like cross-border militancy and refugee repatriation. The changing dynamics between these three players have implications for regional trade, security, and diplomacy.

Pakistan has historically maintained a stronghold over Afghanistan through its support for the Taliban, often viewed as a strategic counterweight to India. However, tensions between Islamabad and Kabul have reached a boiling point. Pakistan accuses Afghanistan of harboring militants from the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which has been responsible for escalating attacks in Pakistan.

(TTP), which has been responsible for escalating attacks in Pakistan. India’s increasing engagement with Afghanistan threatens to erode Pakistan’s strategic leverage over its neighbor. Islamabad now faces the possibility of being diplomatically isolated as Kabul looks beyond its traditional ties.

Economic implications: The decision to use Chabahar port could significantly impact Pakistan’s economy. Landlocked Afghanistan relies heavily on Pakistan for its trade routes, but the use of Chabahar provides an alternative that reduces Islamabad’s economic and strategic importance. This could further strain Pakistan’s already struggling economy, which is grappling with high inflation and a depreciating currency.

The big picture

Regional power shift: India’s growing involvement in Afghanistan represents a broader shift in regional power dynamics. By aligning itself with Kabul, New Delhi is positioning itself as a counterbalance to China and Pakistan’s influence in South Asia.

Despite not officially recognizing the Taliban government, India understands the importance of maintaining a foothold in Afghanistan. It has invested over $3 billion in development projects in Afghanistan over the last two decades, including schools, roads, and dams. Engaging with Kabul allows India to protect its past investments while also positioning itself as a key player in Afghanistan’s future development. The move also aligns with India’s broader regional strategy, which seeks to counter China’s Belt and Road Initiative and its influence in neighboring Pakistan.

Afghanistan’s balancing act

Between the lines

India’s outreach to the Taliban highlights a pragmatic shift in its foreign policy, but it also underscores the limitations of Pakistan’s influence in Afghanistan. For Islamabad, the growing proximity between Kabul and New Delhi represents a failure of its long-standing strategy of using Afghanistan as a buffer state against India.

The Taliban’s willingness to engage with India reflects its desire to reduce dependency on Pakistan while seeking new avenues for trade and development. This realignment, however, does not come without risks. By engaging with a regime criticized for human rights abuses, India risks undermining its global image as a democracy and a defender of human rights.

For Pakistan, the stakes are even higher. The loss of influence in Afghanistan not only weakens its strategic position but also complicates its efforts to address domestic security challenges. The growing isolation of Pakistan in the region could force Islamabad to rethink its approach toward both Afghanistan and India.

What’s next

India’s evolving role:

India’s quiet yet deliberate engagement with the Taliban-led government in Afghanistan is reshaping South Asia’s strategic landscape, leaving Pakistan in a precarious position.For the Taliban, engaging with India is a strategic move to demonstrate autonomy and reduce dependency on Pakistan.The Taliban’s acting foreign Mmnister Muttaqi described India as a “significant regional partner,” signaling Kabul’s intent to strengthen ties with New Delhi.By diversifying its partnerships, Afghanistan can navigate its way out of economic isolation while countering narratives that it is merely a puppet of Pakistan. This approach also provides the Taliban with an opportunity to attract aid and investments from other regional players, including Iran and China.Analysts like Maleeha Lodhi, Pakistan’s former UN ambassador, stress that Pakistan must prioritize trust-building with Afghanistan to repair strained ties and regain lost influence. However, Islamabad’s frequent border closures, airstrikes, and repatriation of Afghan refugees have created resentment, pushing the Taliban to seek alternatives.India is likely to deepen its engagement with Afghanistan through development projects, trade, and humanitarian aid. However, this involvement will remain cautious, as India balances its interests with concerns about the Taliban’s human rights record and its potential to harbor anti-India elements.The resumption of visas for Afghans, particularly for medical and educational purposes, could be a key step in strengthening people-to-people ties. This move could also enhance India’s soft power in the region, providing it with leverage in future diplomatic engagements.(With inputs from agencies)","India’s outreach to the Taliban highlights a pragmatic shift in its foreign policy.

"Jailed ex-Pakistan PM Imran Khan demands fair probe in violence cases, slams government’s 'non-serious' attitude",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/jailed-ex-pakistan-pm-imran-khan-demands-fair-probe-in-violence-cases-slams-governments-non-serious-attitude/articleshow/117149292.cms,"Pakistan's former PM Imran Khan (File photo)

Former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan , currently in Adiala Jail , demanded a transparent investigation and the establishment of a judicial commission to examine violence on November 26 and May 9. He communicated this demand to lawyers and media during a meeting at the jail.Regarding ongoing negotiations in the country, Khan expressed skepticism, stating, ""The government's non-serious attitude towards negotiations is evident from the fact that I haven't even been allowed to meet with my negotiation committee yet. It seems like the purpose of negotiations is merely to waste time so that public reaction over the November 26th Islamabad massacre starts to fade.""Khan called for an impartial judicial commission to investigate the incidents, particularly the November 26 event. ""Peaceful citizens were massacred on November 26th; they were directly shot at, and D-Chowk was drenched in their blood. Many of our people are still missing. In any civilized society, those responsible for such shootings would have been held accountable, but this government has not even managed to form a judicial commission yet. A judicial commission acts as a (neutral) third umpire. Only an impartial commission can provide justice to the martyrs of November 26th (2024) and May 9th (2023). If this massacre is swept under the rug, no one’s life or property in Pakistan will be safe,"" he said.He also alleged mistreatment of PTI members in custody and called for these claims to be raised internationally. ""While in military custody, our innocent people were subjected to severe mental and physical torture. According to my information, three young men attempted suicide during custody. Sami Wazir’s condition is a stark testament to this brutality. What happened to PTI leaders like Shahbaz Gill and Azam Swati is no secret. Zille Shah was brutally murdered, and Intezar Panjutha was treated worse than animals. What kind of justice is this? Those who leave PTI are absolved of any charges related to May 9th, while those who refuse are subjected to all kinds of torture and pressure,"" Khan stated.Further threatening to take the alleges injustice to global forums, the ex-Pakistan PM added, ""We haven't obtained justice despite repeatedly appealing to Pakistan’s judicial system, leaving us with no choice but to raise our voice on international forums. Pakistan’s government is bound by international laws and treaties regarding human rights. I have instructed our lawyers to take these matters to global forums and draw the world’s attention to the ongoing human rights violations in Pakistan.""In connection to the May 9 case, Imran Khan has approached the Lahore High Court for bail, according to ARY News. The case is centred around severe unrest across Pakistan following Imran Khan's arrest on May 9, 2023. Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) supporters demonstrated their outrage through widespread protests in both rural and urban areas, prompting authorities to deploy military forces in Balochistan, Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Islamabad to maintain security. During these demonstrations, PTI supporters targeted military facilities, including an assault on the Corps Commander's residence in Lahore. Subsequently, Imran Khan was named as the primary accused in the legal proceedings. The November 26 protests were also centred on similar demands with PTI members demanding release of their leader.Khan also addressed the people of Pakistan saying, ""My message to overseas Pakistanis is that democracy and human rights have been obliterated in Pakistan, to be replaced by the law of the jungle. Your boycott of foreign currency remittances is critical. Your loved ones in Pakistan deserve the same rights that you enjoy abroad.""Khan also talked about the fake allegations and cases against him while putting forward the demand for transparent investigation and justice. ""Our government was falsely accused of resettling the Taliban. Terrorism did not resurface during our tenure, and even a year after it ended. The same people who are responsible for conditions in Balochistan are also responsible for the current chaos,"" he said adding, "" No leader in Pakistan’s history has ever faced 280 cases. This kind of treatment was only meted out to Sheikh Mujibur Rahman during General Yahya's rule, and now it is being done to me.""Additionally, citing a World Bank report, Khan expressed concern about rising poverty and the impact of political instability on the economy. ""according to a recent World Bank report, an additional 13 million people have fallen below the poverty line. Every institution, including the judiciary, NAB, FIA, and police, have been tasked to work against PTI, causing political and economic systems to collapse and instability to reach its peak. Economic growth will remain zero as long as political instability persists. All of this is being done to bolster the plan for a decade-long dictatorship. Anyone who supports this lawlessness can have their corruption of billions pardoned.""According to PTI, Khan has been imprisoned for over 520 days.",Former Pakistan PM Imran Khan is currently in Adiala Jail.

"'Degraded': US strikes set back Iran’s nuclear programme, says Pentagon; estimates upto 2-year delay",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/degraded-us-strikes-set-back-irans-nuclear-programme-says-pentagon-estimates-upto-2-year-delay/articleshow/122217660.cms,"This satellite image provided by Maxar Technologies shows the Isfahan nuclear technology center in Iran after US strikes





Recent US intelligence reports reveal that military operations have substantially impacted Iran's nuclear capabilities, setting it back approximately two years, according to Pentagon sources, quoted by AFP on Wednesday.Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell informed reporters, ""We have degraded their program by one to two years at least -- intel assessments inside the (Defense) Department assess that."" He subsequently clarified: ""We're thinking probably closer to two years.""Last month, US forces deployed B-2 bombers to strike two Iranian nuclear facilities using powerful GBU-57 bunker-buster bombs, whilst a third location was targeted by Tomahawk cruise missiles from a submarine.On June 13, Israel conducted an extensive aerial operation against Iranian nuclear installations, targeting facilities, nuclear scientists, and senior military officials. The campaign aimed to halt Iran's nuclear programme, which Tehran maintains is peaceful, though Washington and allies contend it is directed towards developing nuclear weapons.US President Donald Trump had initially sought diplomatic solutions to replace the nuclear agreement he cancelled in 2018 during his first term. However, he ultimately opted for military intervention.The American military operation was extensive, employing over 125 aircraft, including stealth bombers, fighter jets, and refuelling aircraft, alongside a missile-equipped submarine.","Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell informed reporters, ""We have degraded their program by one to two years at least"" US forces deployed B-2 bombers to strike two Iranian nuclear facilities using powerful GBU-57 bunker-buster bombs, whilst a third location was targeted by Tomahawk cruise missiles.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122218456,imgsize-1906127,width-400,resizemode-4/122218456.jpg"

At least four people died and many others were missing after a ferry sank in rough seas near Indonesia’s Bali island late Wednesday (local time), news agency AFP reported.The KMP Tunu Pratama Jaya went down about 30 minutes after leaving Ketapang port in East Java. It was headed for Gilimanuk port in Bali, which is about 50 kilometers away, the National Search and Rescue Agency said in a statement as cited by the news agency Associated Press.""23 rescued, 4 dead,"" Rama Samtama Putra, police chief of the East Javan town of Banyuwangi was quoted as saying by news agency AFP.The ferry was carrying 65 people, 53 passengers and 12 crew members, along with 22 vehicles, including 14 trucks.Search and rescue teams have been operating since Wednesday night. Nine boats, including two tugboats and two inflatable boats, have been searching for the missing people in waves up to 2 meters high.The ferry journey from Java to Bali usually takes about one hour and is commonly used by people traveling between the islands by car. It was not immediately known whether any foreign nationals were on board when the ferry sank.Indonesia, which has more than 17,000 islands, often relies on ferries for transportation. Accidents are common due to poor enforcement of safety standards.In March, a boat with 16 people on board capsized in rough waters off Bali, resulting in the death of an Australian woman and injuries to at least one other person.In 2022, a ferry carrying over 800 people ran aground in shallow waters near East Nusa Tenggara province. It remained stuck for two days before being freed, with no reported injuries.In 2018, more than 150 people died when a ferry sank in one of the world's deepest lakes on Indonesia’s Sumatra island.","The KMP Tunu Pratama Jaya went down about 30 minutes after leaving Ketapang port in East Java.

Microsoft Corp's gaming division began cutting hundreds of employees on Wednesday, its second mass layoff in months and its largest in more than two years. Microsoft employed 228,000 full-time workers as of last June. Subsidiaries across the gaming organisation were told that they would be affected by the layoffs -- King division, which makes Candy Crush, is cutting 10% of its staff, or about 200 jobs; Call of Duty maker Raven Software has announced workforce reductions. Microsoft also cancelled several projects that had been in development for years, including the fantasy game Everwild, and an original new online game from ZeniMax Online Studios, the maker of The Elder Scrolls Online. Both studios will cut jobs as a result of the cancellations. Microsoft said Wednesday it's eliminating 9,000 workers.","Microsoft Corp's gaming division began cutting hundreds of employees on Wednesday.

Sean 'Diddy' Combs acquitted of sex trafficking but found guilty on lesser charges,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/combs-acquitted-of-sex-trafficking-but-found-guilty-on-lesser-charges/articleshow/122215761.cms,"



Music mogul Sean ""Diddy"" Combs was found not guilty of racketeering and sex trafficking Wednesday but convicted of a less serious prostitution charge after a high-profile marathon trial in New York. The jury, after 13 hours of deliberation, found Combs guilty of two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution, each of which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. But he was acquitted of a major racketeering charge and two sex trafficking charges that could have sent him to prison for life.Combs bowed his head, quietly pumping his fists in his lap and bringing his hands together in a prayer as the verdicts were read out. At one point, he looked towards the ceiling, appearing to express deep relief.He shook hands with one of his lawyers, who embraced each other - two of them teared up in joy - and mouthed thanks to the eight-man, four-woman jury as they filed out of the courtroom.The relatively quick verdict arrived after seven weeks of testimony, in which prosecutors had accused Combs of being the boss of a decades-long criminal group who directed loyal employees and bodyguards to commit myriad offences at his behest.Jurors announced a partial verdict late Tuesday and said they were deadlocked on the racketeering charge - but Judge Arun Subramanian instructed them to keep working.Combs, once one of the most powerful figures in the music industry, had vehemently denied all charges. Along with racketeering, Combs was charged with sex trafficking two women: singer Casandra Ventura and a woman who testified under the pseudonym Jane.Both were in long-term relationships with the entrepreneur and hip-hop pioneer, and they each testified about abuse, threats and coercive sex in wrenching detail.They both said they felt obligated to participate in Combs-directed sexual marathons with hired men.Combs's lawyers insisted the sex was consensual. They conceded domestic violence was a feature of his relationships -- one harrowing example of him beating and dragging Ventura was caught on security footage that has been widely publicised.Yet while disturbing, that did not amount to sex trafficking, the defence said. Jurors ultimately agreed.Ventura's lawyer, Douglas Wigdor, released a statement saying she had made an ""indelible mark on both the entertainment industry and the fight for justice.""Combs's family, present throughout the trial that began in early May, clapped and cheered for him in court.","Combs found guilty of two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution.

Trump's immigration crackdown: DOJ memo outlines plans for 'prioritizing denaturalization’; Who will face denaturalization in the US ?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-immigration-crackdown-doj-memo-outlines-plans-for-prioritizing-denaturalization-who-will-face-denaturalizationintheus/articleshow/122196341.cms,"What is denaturalization?

Is ‘good moral character’ a condition for retaining US citizenship?

Who can be denaturalized?





A memo issued by the US Department of Justice(DOJ) has directed federal attorneys to actively pursue denaturalization cases, aligning with the Trump administration's immigration enforcement objectives.The memo dated June 11 instructed DOJ’s civil division to “prioritize and maximally pursue denaturalization proceedings in all cases permitted by law and supported by the evidence” to ""advance the Administration's policy objectives"".The concept of naturalization typically concerns the grant of citizenship to a person who has lived in the United States for a specified time period and meets certain other requirements. So the concept of denaturalization refers to the revocation of citizenship from a naturalized US citizen.In the United States, when an individual is denaturalized, they revert to their prior status before obtaining citizenship. For instance, if someone was once a permanent resident, they will be regarded as such again, potentially leading to deportation actions.The memo states that US attorneys were given significant authority to begin actions against naturalized citizens, especially those considered to have a deficiency in ""good moral character.""Officials were required to prove that an individual did not possess ""good moral character,"" a term that is broadly interpreted and not clearly defined.The recent memo outlines various categories of individuals who may have their naturalized citizenship revoked, offering clearer criteria for determining who is deemed lacking in ""moral character."" This includes individuals connected to terrorism, espionage, war criminals, and those who have been found to have provided false information during their naturalization process.While attorneys are urged to prioritize cases involving individuals who ""pose a potential danger to national security,"" the memo also states that they can seek out ""any other cases referred to the Civil Division that the Division determines to be sufficiently important to pursue.""Denaturalization is among the DOJ’s top five enforcement priorities for the civil division, which also lists “Combatting Discriminatory Practices and Policies,” “Ending Antisemitism,” “Protecting Women and Children,” and “Ending Sanctuary Jurisdictions”.","A memo issued by the US Department of Justice has directed federal attorneys to actively pursue denaturalization cases.

Recall of probe report 'abnormal'







The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) blocked probe into the allegations of Chinese Communist Party meddling into the 2020 US presidential elections to benefit Joe Biden , aiming to shield then-FBI Director Christopher Wray as it would ""contradict"" his congressional testimony, Fox News Digital reported citing newly declassified FBI documents.The documents, containing exchanges between FBI officials prior to the 2020 election, were recently declassified by FBI director Kash Patel and sent to senate judiciary committee chair Chuck Grassley of Iowa.According to the report, Chinese government created “a large amount” of fake US driver’s licenses, generated using data from millions of TikTok users, “tens of thousands of Chinese students and immigrants sympathetic to the Chinese Communist Party to vote for US Presidential Candidate Joe Biden, despite not being eligible to vote in the United States,” the New York Post reported.Moreover, the FBI’s Albany field office reported the plot from a credible source, but FBI headquarters ""suppressed"" the report, partly because it would ""contradict"" director Wray’s congressional testimony claiming no coordinated national voter fraud.Internal communications showed Albany staff protested the suppression, warning that political motives were influencing intelligence handling and that the suppression prevented other agencies from vetting the information.Details of the alleged meddling were shared in an FBI Intelligence Information Report (IIR) on September 25, 2020, just a day after Wray told Congress the bureau had no knowledge of any “coordinated national voter fraud effort”. The report, however, was withdrawn within minutes of being released.Calling the move ""abnormal"", FBI assistant director Marshall Yates, in a letter to Chuck Grassley earlier this year said, “Based on conversations with key individuals involved, it was conveyed that the recall of the IIR was abnormal.”Yates had said that the probe report had ""prompted significant attention throughout FBI Headquarters"" and ""the recall was issued to 'reinterview' the source.""""The rationale provided to Albany staff for the recall was that Headquarters deemed the report not 'authoritative,' but this characterization was met with disagreement by those in the Albany office. Internal emails reflect that Albany staff had concerns that suppressing the IIR would be 'dangerous if we cite potential political implications as reasons for not putting out our information,' emphasizing that it was not the role of analysts to align intelligence with public testimony,"" he wrote in the letter.","Recall of probe report 'abnormal' says FBI assistant director Marshall Yates.

Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska made a critical call on Tuesday, casting a vote for President Donald Trump’s massive tax-and-spending bill.For much of the all‑night session, Senate Minority Whip John Thune was uncertain whether he could secure Murkowski’s support. The Alaska senator spent hours in public and private discussions, pressing colleagues to soften provisions she said would burden her state’s most vulnerable residents.Murkowski at the end provided the 50th Republican “yea”, paving the way for Vice‑President JD Vance to break the tie and pass the measure 51‑50.Three Republicans—Susan Collins of Maine, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Rand Paul of Kentucky—joined all Democrats in opposing the bill.“I advocated for my state’s interests, and I will make no excuses for doing that,” Murkowski told reporters just after the vote. “Do I like this bill? No. But I tried to take care of Alaska’s interests.”Her support was unsure after the Senate parliamentarian struck down two attempts to boost Medicaid payments for Alaska and Hawaii, ruling they violated reconciliation rules. A further bid to increase Alaska’s Medicaid funding was also rejected early Tuesday, dealing another blow to Thune’s efforts.“I held my head up and made sure that the people of Trump’s ‘Big Beautiful Bill’ could cost thousands of lives, say University researchersAlaska are not forgotten in this,” Murkowski said. “I think there is more that needs to be done, and I’m not done.

Diddy trial verdict: Rapper convicted on prostitution charges; cleared on sex trafficking counts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/diddy-trial-verdict-hip-hop-mogul-cleared-of-sex-trafficking-charges-guilty-of-soliciting-prostitution-full-judgement/articleshow/122208725.cms,"Court Turns Circus Before Diddy Verdict: Half-Naked Woman Sparks Outrage

Disturbing allegations, mixed outcome

Inside the case: What Diddy was accused of





In a mixed verdict, the court found Sean ""Diddy"" Combs not guilty of racketeering conspiracy and not guilty of sex trafficking allegations involving both Cassie Ventura and a woman referred to as ""Jane. "" However, he was found guilty of transporting Ventura, Jane, and others across state lines for the purpose of prostitution. The outcome reflects a partial conviction, clearing him of the most severe trafficking charges while holding him accountable for facilitating illegal transport.The verdict, delivered by a Manhattan jury after three days of deliberations, means the 55-year-old hip-hop mogul avoids a life sentence but still faces the possibility of up to 10 years in prison. He was found guilty of violating the federal Mann Act by transporting individuals — including ex-girlfriends and paid male sex workers — across state lines for prostitution.Combs showed visible relief as the jury returned its decision. He smiled, nodded, and clasped his hands together in a prayer-like gesture towards the jury, before hugging his lead defence lawyer, Teny Geragos. Moments later, he thanked the panel of eight men and four women, who had earlier struggled to reach consensus on the most serious racketeering charge.The acquittal on the racketeering and sex trafficking charges — both of which could have resulted in life imprisonment — marks a significant legal victory for Combs. But the felony conviction under the Mann Act still puts his freedom and career in serious jeopardy.Prosecutors had painted Combs as the architect of a two-decade criminal enterprise, using his fame, wealth and staff to intimidate, coerce and control his victims. Central to the case were accusations from singer Cassie Ventura and another woman known only as ""Jane"", both of whom alleged years of psychological and sexual abuse.The women testified that Combs forced them into drug-fuelled sex marathons involving hired male sex workers — events referred to in court as “freak-offs.” Jurors heard disturbing claims of beatings, blackmail, and threats of revenge porn. One hotel assault caught on camera showed Combs dragging and kicking Ventura — footage that circulated widely.At the heart of the federal trial were disturbing allegations that Combs used his wealth, power and influence to force women into sexually abusive situations. Prosecutors accused him of orchestrating drug-fuelled sex marathons involving male sex workers, using blackmail, violence and coercion to maintain control over victims.Central to the case was testimony from R&B singer Cassie Ventura, Combs’ former long-term partner, and another woman known only as Jane. Both described being trapped in abusive relationships where they were allegedly threatened, assaulted, and pressured into performing sexual acts at Combs’ direction.Prosecutors argued that Combs operated like a mob boss, using a network of employees, bodyguards and assistants to commit or cover up crimes including bribery, arson, kidnapping and witness tampering. They pursued the racketeering charge under the federal RICO statute — a legal tool historically used to dismantle organised crime.Combs’ legal team rejected the charges as an overreach, describing the trial as an attempt to criminalise his consensual sexual lifestyle. They acknowledged elements of domestic violence but insisted there was no basis for federal sex trafficking charges.","The verdict means the 55-year-old hip-hop mogul avoids a life sentence but still faces the possibility of up to 10 years in prison.

Man charged with killing former Minnesota House speaker is due back in court after delay,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/man-charged-with-killing-former-minnesota-house-speaker-is-due-back-in-court-after-delay/articleshow/122218254.cms,"Man charged with killing former Minnesota House speaker is due back in court after delay (Image: AP)





ST PAUL: The man charged with killing former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, and wounding a state senator and his wife, is due back in federal court Thursday for a hearing that was put on hold after his lawyer said his client had been unable to sleep while on suicide watch.The hearing is expected to address whether Vance Boelter should remain in custody without bail and affirm that there is probable cause to proceed with the case. He's not expected to enter a plea. Prosecutors need to secure a grand jury indictment first, before his arraignment, which is when a plea is normally entered.An unshaven Boelter, 57, of Green Isle, was wearing a green padded suicide prevention suit and orange slippers when he was brought into court last Friday. Federal defender Manny Atwal then asked Magistrate Judge Douglas Micko to continue the hearing. She said Boelter had been sleep deprived due to harsh conditions in the Sherburne County Jail, making it difficult for them to communicate.""Your honour, I haven't really slept in about 12 to 14 days,"" Boelter told the judge then. And he denied being suicidal. ""I've never been suicidal and I am not suicidal now.""Sherburne County Sheriff Joel Brott, whose jail houses both county and federal prisoners, rejected Boelter's claims of poor conditions as absurd.""He is not in a hotel. He's in jail, where a person belongs when they commit the heinous crimes he is accused of committing,"" Brott said in a statement Friday.Boelter faces separate cases in federal and state court on charges of murder and attempted murder for what the state's chief federal prosecutor, Acting U.S. Attorney Joe Thompson, has called ""a political assassination"" and ""a chilling attack on our democracy."" The feds are going first.Authorities say Hortman and her husband, Mark, were shot to death in their home in the Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Park in the early hours of June 14 by a man disguised as a police officer who was driving a fake squad car.Boelter also allegedly shot and seriously wounded state Sen John Hoffman, and his wife, Yvette, earlier that morning at their home in nearby Champlin. The Hoffmans are recovering, but Hortman's golden retriever, Gilbert, was seriously injured and had to be euthanized.Boelter surrendered near his home the night of June 15 after what authorities called the largest search in Minnesota history, a hunt of around 40 hours.Atwal told the court last week that Boelter had been kept in what's known as a ""Gumby suit,"" without undergarments, ever since his first court appearance June 16. She said the lights were on in his area 24 hours a day, doors slammed frequently, the inmate in the next cell would spread feces on the walls, and the smell would drift to Boelter's cell.The attorney said transferring him to segregation instead, and giving him a normal jail uniform, would let him get some sleep, restore some dignity, and let him communicate better. The judge granted the delay.Boelter's lawyers have declined to comment on the charges themselves, which could carry the federal death penalty. Thompson has said no decision has been made whether to seek it. Minnesota abolished its death penalty in 1911. But Attorney General Pam Bondi has said from the start that the Trump administration will be more aggressive in seeking capital punishment.Prosecutors allege Boelter also stopped at the homes of two other Democratic lawmakers. They also say he listed dozens of other Democrats as potential targets, including officials in other states. Friends described Boelter as an evangelical Christian with politically conservative views. But prosecutors have declined so far to speculate on a motive.Former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris joined the mourners at the Hortmans' funeral last Saturday. Gov Tim Walz, Harris's running mate on the 2024 Democratic presidential ticket, eulogized Hortman as ""the most consequential speaker in Minnesota history.""Hortman served as speaker from 2019 until January. She then yielded the post to a Republican in a power-sharing deal after the House became tied in the 2024 elections, and became speaker emerita.",Vance Boelter is due back in federal court Thursday for a hearing that was put on hold after his lawyer said his client had been unable to sleep.

Halting some arms shipments to Ukraine: US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/halting-some-arms-shipments-to-ukraine-us/articleshow/122215594.cms,"



Ukraine appealed to the United States for clarity on Wednesday after it was caught off guard by a White House announcement that Washington was halting some arms shipments to the war-battered country. The Ukrainian defence ministry, which is deeply dependent on US arms, said it had not been notified about the reduction in aid announced one day earlier.Moscow revelled in the decision, saying it could bring the end of the war closer. Any slow down in US support could harm Kyiv's ability to fend off escalating Russian aerial bombardments or frontline gains.Kyiv has long feared halts to US aid after Donald Trump returned to the White House in Jan, having criticised the tens of billions of dollars in support and weapons sent by his predecessor, Joe Biden. ""It will be even more scary, even more painful, and even more civilians will suffer,"" Kyiv resident Yevgenia Prysiazhna said, referring to an uptick in overnight drone and missile attacks on Ukraine.","The Ukrainian defence ministry, which is deeply dependent on US arms, said it had not been notified about the reduction in aid.

Vietnam agrees to minimum 20% tariff; US goes duty-free,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/vietnam-agrees-to-minimum-20-tariff-us-goes-duty-free/articleshow/122215347.cms,"



WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump announced a trade deal with Vietnam Wednesday that would allow US goods to enter the country duty-free. Vietnamese exports to the United States, by contrast, would face a 20% levy. On his Truth Social platform, Trump declared the pact ""a Great Deal of Cooperation between our two Countries"".In a govt statement, Vietnam confirmed that negotiating teams had come to an agreement to address the reciprocal tariff issue, but did not detail any tariff terms. Trump ""affirmed that the US will significantly reduce reciprocal taxes for many Vietnamese export goods and will continue to cooperate with Vietnam in resolving difficulties affecting bilateral trade relations, especially in areas prioritized by both sides,"" the statement said.In April, Trump announced a 46% tax on Vietnamese imports - one of his so-called reciprocal tariffs targeting dozens of countries with which the United States runs trade deficits.Trump promptly suspended the reciprocal tariffs for 90 days to allow for negotiations like the one with Vietnam. The pause expires Tuesday, but so far the Trump administration has reached a trade agreement with only one of those countries - the United Kingdom.(Trump has also reached a ""framework"" agreement with China in a separate trade dispute.)The United States last year ran a $122 billion trade deficit with Vietnam. That was the third-biggest US trade gap - the difference between the goods and services it buys from other countries and those it sells them - behind the ones with China and Mexico.In addition to the 20% tariffs, Trump said the US would impose a 40% tax on ""transshipping"" - goods from another country that stop in Vietnam on their way to the United States. Washington complains that Chinese goods have been dodging higher US tariffs by transiting through Vietnam.In May, Vietnam approved a $1.5 billion project by the Trump Organisation and a local partner to build a massive golf resort complex near its capital Hanoi, covering an area roughly the size of 336 football fields.","Vietnam confirms that negotiating teams had come to an agreement to address the reciprocal tariff issue.

Sean ""Diddy"" Combs was denied bail on Wednesday after a jury convicted him of federal prostitution charges, though he was acquitted of more serious allegations involving sex trafficking and racketeering.Judge Arun Subramanian ruled that Combs would remain in custody while awaiting sentencing on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution. Each count carries a potential sentence of up to 10 years in prison.Defense attorney Marc Agnifilo urged the judge to release Combs before sentencing, stating, “He’s not going to flee. He’s been given his life back.” But Judge Subramanian refused to reconsider, pointing to the seriousness of the evidence presented during the trial.“For present purposes, the defendant is unable to meet his burden” to prove by clear and convincing evidence that he does not pose a threat to any person or the community, the judge said. He also highlighted that “at trial, the defense conceded the defendant’s violence in his personal relationships,” adding that the evidence showed Combs had a “yearslong pattern of violence.”Prosecutor Maurene Comey argued against bail, stating, “The only thing that’s exceptional about Combs is his wealth, his violence and his brazenness” and “his continued criminality and his willingness to violate the law.”Agnifilo pushed back with a pointed remark: “Listening to Ms. Comey makes me appreciate that we have juries.”Combs, 55, was found guilty of two prostitution-related offenses that carry a maximum sentence of 10 years each. However, the jury acquitted him of sex trafficking and racketeering charges that could have led to a life sentence. He has been in custody since his arrest in September.","Sean ""Diddy"" Combs was convicted of federal prostitution charges.

‘Malfeasance’: Donald Trump’s housing chief urges Congress to probe Fed’s Jerome Powell; cites 'deceptive' testimony,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/malfeasance-donald-trumps-housing-chief-urges-congress-to-probe-feds-jerome-powell-cites-deceptive-testimony/articleshow/122213900.cms,"Jerome Powell (AP)





US President Donald Trump's top housing regulator is intensifying his clash with federal reserve chair Jerome Powell, urging Congress to launch an investigation into the central bank leader.Federal housing finance agency director Bill Pulte, who has voiced growing concerns that high borrowing rates are harming the housing market, urged lawmakers on Wednesday to investigate Powell for alleged “political bias” and for his recent Senate testimony regarding renovations at the Fed’s headquarters.Pulte accused Powell of lying to Congress last week about the condition of the nearly 100-year-old building, which Powell described as requiring “serious renovation.”“This is nothing short of malfeasance and warrants ‘for cause’ removal,” Pulte said in the statement posted on X. “Chairman Powell must be investigated by Congress immediately.”Pulte’s criticism mirrors that of President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly attacked Fed Chair, recently dubbing him “too late” for not cutting interest rates sooner. Earlier this week, Trump sent Powell a handwritten note claiming, “you have cost the USA a fortune, and continue to do so,” pointing out that US interest rates are still higher than those in many other major economies.The attack over the Fed building renovations marks a new angle in the administration’s criticism of Powell. During a hearing, senate banking chair Tim Scott questioned the Fed chief about the project, referencing a New York Post article that likened the renovations to the “Palace of Versailles.”","US President Donald Trump's top housing regulator is intensifying his clash with federal reserve chair Jerome Powell.

A 30-year-old man accused of fatally stabbing four Idaho college students in 2022 pleaded guilty on Wednesday as part of a plea deal to avoid the death penalty, admitting to the quadruple murder in the small college town.Bryan Kohberger, a PhD criminology student, had been scheduled to stand trial in August for the brutal killings that shocked the US.At a courtroom in Boise, Idaho, he pleaded guilty to all charges, accepted four consecutive life sentences, and waived his right to appeal. During the hearing, Judge Steven Hippler detailed the terms of the plea deal and chose not to reject the agreement, despite it being a source of division among the victims’ families.Kohberger remained motionless and showed no emotion as the court read the victims’ names. The judge asked him whether he had carried out the murders “willfully, unlawfully, deliberately, with premeditation and malice aforethought.”He responded, “yes”.Judge Hippler said he will formally be sentenced on 23 July.The plea agreement guarantees that Kohberger will not face trial, originally scheduled for August, and removes the possibility of a death sentence for the murders of Madison Mogen, 21; Kaylee Goncalves, 21; Xana Kernodle, 20; and Ethan Chapin, 20.The gruesome nature of the killings, the young age of the victims, and the suspect’s criminology background drew widespread public attention to the case.The four University of Idaho students were discovered fatally stabbed in their off-campus rental home on November 13, 2022. Kohberger, who was studying criminal justice at a nearby university at the time, was arrested weeks later in Pennsylvania, where his family resides.The plea agreement has caused division among the victims’ families.Outside the courtroom, Kaylee Goncalves’ father, Steve, said he felt “pretty let down,” adding that the state “made a deal with the devil,” according to newsagency Reuters.His family had hoped for a full confession, including information about where the murder weapon was hidden and confirmation that the defendant acted alone. The family claimed that prosecutors rushed into the plea deal without consulting the victims' families.""After more than two years, this is how it concludes with a secretive deal and a hurried effort to close the case without any input from the victims’ families on the plea’s details,"" the family said.However, Madison Mogen's father, Ben, told CBS that he felt relieved by the outcome and welcomed the deal because it enables his family to move forward with their lives and avoid a trial that would require revisiting the entire case in detail.“We can actually put this behind us and not have these future dates and future things ... that have to do with this terrible person,” he said. “We get to just think about the rest of lives and have to try and figure out how to do it without Maddie and the rest of the kids,” he added.Kohberger, a student at nearby Washington State University, was charged in January 2023. Until now, he had maintained his innocence, and prosecutors have not disclosed a motive. It is believed that he did not know the victims personally.","Bryan Kohberger, 30, pleads guilty to killing four University of Idaho students in 2022.

A federal judge has blocked US President Donald Trump’s asylum ban at the United States-Mexico border, ruling that the president exceeded his authority by issuing a proclamation declaring illegal immigration an emergency and bypassing existing legal processes.In a 128-page opinion, US district judge Randolph Moss wrote that Trump’s January 20 proclamation—blocking all migrants “engaged in the invasion across the southern border” from seeking asylum or other humanitarian protections—went beyond the limits of executive power.The decision marks a setback for Trump, a Republican who reclaimed the White House pledging a sweeping immigration crackdown. Since he took office, the number of migrants apprehended crossing the border illegally has fallen to record lows.The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) challenged the asylum ban in February, arguing it violated US law and international treaties.Trump’s restrictions were broader than a similar ban imposed by former US President Joe Biden, a Democrat, in 2024. Key portions of Biden’s policy were blocked in May by a different federal judge in another ACLU-led lawsuit.Moss said he would stay the effective date of his order for 14 days to give the Trump administration time to file an appeal.","A federal judge has blocked US President Donald Trump’s asylum ban at the United States-Mexico border.

At least 12 people were injured in a bus crash at New York City's port authority bus terminal, causing major traffic disruptions and delays to bus services during the morning rush hour, according to officials.Around 6 a.m., three New Jersey Transit buses collided on the fourth-level entrance ramp at West 40th Street and Ninth Avenue near the port authority bus terminal in Manhattan, authorities said. The crash, which occurred near Times Square, left 12 people with non-life-threatening injuries, according to the New York City fire department and port authority police.Following the collision, NJ transit temporarily suspended service to the port authority bus terminal, and the authorities at the bus terminal shut down the express bus lane ramp for several hours. Although the ramp has since reopened, officials warned that residual delays should still be expected.An investigation is currently ongoing to identify the cause of the collision.The three-bus crash disrupted traffic on several major routes, including a 30-minute delay at the heavily used Lincoln Tunnel connecting New Jersey to Manhattan.

When to expect a vote?



GOP needs full house caucus







With only hours remaining before the planned vote, house Republican leaders and White House officials have launched a full-scale effort on Wednesday to push the massive GOP bill through the house and onto President Donald Trump ’s desk.Multiple groups of house Republican lawmakers who have expressed concerns about the senate-approved version of the domestic policy bill are meeting on Wednesday morning. Speaker Mike Johnson is actively engaging with these groups, including a key faction of conservative hard-liners, reported Politico.Several groups of Republican holdouts are also heading to the White House on Wednesday to meet with Trump, who has insisted the bill be finalized by July 4. Meanwhile, skeptical GOP members from across the ideological spectrum expressed caution, saying they were still reviewing the Senate-passed bill, which spans 887 pages.Several groups of Republican holdouts are also heading to the White House on Wednesday to meet with Trump, who has insisted the bill be finalized by July 4. Meanwhile, GOP members from across the ideological spectrum expressed caution, saying they were still reviewing the Senate-passed bill, which spans 887 pages.Republicans are keen on pushing the bill through the house as early as possible, with fears of intraparty holdout dynamics looming large if there were to be any significant delays. When asked about the voting on Wednesday morning, house majority leader Steve Scalise said he expected final passage “sometime today.”The situation could shift if the holdout Republicans unite and resist the intense lobbying push. GOP leaders are closely watching the initial procedural votes that would pave the way for final consideration of the megabill. They’re aiming to hold those votes as early as 11 am Wednesday, but that timeline could be delayed if party whips determine there isn’t enough backing to advance the bill. With full attendance, just four Republican defections could derail it.“If there’s four [GOP ‘nos’], there’s going to be 20, and it’s going to be a jailbreak,” said one House Republican to Politico, granted anonymity to candidly describe internal dynamics.When asked whether he had the votes to move the bill forward on Wednesday, speaker responded, “We’re working on all that right now.” Republican leaders narrowly secured a 212-211 win on an initial procedural vote pushed by Democrats to delay the bill, allowing it to advance. However, several more critical votes are still expected.The White House intensified its pressure campaign Monday night as Trump, Vice-President JD Vance, and senior administration officials launched a fresh wave of public support for the expansive legislation, which features a $5 trillion increase to the debt limit and deficit spending that has unsettled many congressional Republicans.White House officials have tried to ease worries about the deficit by urging lawmakers to overlook the expenses associated with extending the 2017 tax cuts, which are set to expire at the end of the year. On Wednesday, Trump praised the bill’s potential for “GROWTH,” calling it the main reason the “big, beautiful bill” will become one of the most successful pieces of legislation ever passed.“Our Country will make a fortune this year, more than any of our competitors, but only if the Big, Beautiful Bill is PASSED!,” Trumphe wrote on Truth Social. “Republicans, don’t let the Radical Left Democrats push you around.”","House Republican leaders and White House officials have launched a full-scale effort on Wednesday to push the massive GOP bill through the house.

NEW DELHI: A massive outcry has erupted in Pakistan's restive Balochistan province following the disappearance and subsequent killing of a young Baloch activist, Zeeshan Ahmed , by military personnel.Zeeshan had been campaigning for the safe return of his father, Zaheer, who was also forcibly disappeared by Pakistan's Frontier Corps in 2015. Zeeshan was 11 years old at that time, and his sister a 40-day-old newborn.Zeeshan went missing on June 29 and his body was recovered the next day.The incident is the latest in a series of ""forced disappearances"" that has long plagued Balochistan. According to a Human Rights Watch report, there are 8,463 documented cases of such disappearances between 2011 and 2024; the Pakistan Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances estimates at least 10,078 cases.Zeeshan was abducted on June 29, around 8pm, after a football match. He was walking towards home when ""two vehicles belonging to the state-backed death squad intercepted him"", the Baloch Yakjehti Committee said. ""Witnesses saw him beaten up, his hands bound and then thrown into one of the vehicles,"" the committee said.That same night, family and residents of Panjgur blocked the CPEC road and began a sit-in, demanding Zeeshan's immediate release. By morning, they were mourning as Zeeshan's ""bullet-riddled body was found dumped in Panjgur. His corpse bore clear signs of torture, bruises from sticks and blunt force, six bullets to the chest, and deep knife wounds"", the committee said.","Zeeshan Ahmed went missing on June 29 and his body was recovered the next day.

At least 64 people have died and 117 others have been injured across Pakistan in the past week due to flash floods and heavy rain, a government agency said on Wednesday.The worst-hit area was the northwestern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where 23 people, including 10 children, lost their lives. In Punjab province, another 21 people were killed—11 of them children—mainly due to homes collapsing in the rain, reported news agency AFP.Over the weekend, torrential rain triggered sudden floods in the Swat Valley. In one incident, 12 members of a family from Mardan were swept away while picnicking near the river. Locals said there were no immediate rescue efforts despite repeated calls for help. Videos from the scene showed people clinging to rocks and screaming as waters surged.“We kept dialling the emergency numbers, but no one came. By the time they did, it was too late,” Kabeer, a local vendor who helped retrieve bodies, told TOI earlier.Swat residents expressed frustration at repeated government failures in disaster response. “This valley has lived through terrorists, military operations, and devastating floods. Every time, we’re promised lessons will be learned, but nothing changes,” said Khan Sher from Mingora.Despite its push for climate justice globally, Pakistan's domestic preparedness remains weak. Locals in tourist towns like Bahrain and Kalam, where riverside hotels were hit hard, said the floods turned busy market areas into danger zones within minutes.“Each year we mourn our dead, patch up the roads, and brace for the next disaster,” said Liaquat Bacha, a farmer whose fields were destroyed. Rescue efforts are ongoing.","The worst-hit area was the northwestern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where 23 people, including 10 children, lost their lives.

Five people, including a senior local administrator, were killed when a roadside bomb struck a government vehicle in northwestern Pakistan on Wednesday, injuring 11 others, according to local police, cited by news agency AP.The attack occurred in Bajaur, a tribal district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, long seen as a haven for militant groups. Among the dead was Assistant Commissioner Faisal Sultan, a senior government officer. District police chief Waqas Rafique said the wounded had been rushed to hospital, with several in critical condition.Although no group has claimed responsibility, officials suspect the Pakistani Taliban, or Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), to be behind the attack. The group has been responsible for a string of recent assaults targeting security personnel and civil servants in the region. TTP is closely linked to the Afghan Taliban and has gained renewed momentum since the fall of Kabul in 2021.This bombing follows a deadly suicide attack last Saturday in North Waziristan, another restive district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where 16 soldiers were killed when a militant rammed an explosives-laden vehicle into a military convoy. That attack was claimed by the Hafiz Gul Bahadur group, a faction of the Pakistani Taliban.Pakistan has seen a surge in militant violence along its western border, with over 290 people mostly security personnel killed in attacks this year alone.","Five people, including a senior local administrator, were killed when a roadside bomb struck a government vehicle in northwestern Pakistan.

MINGORA, SWAT: Torrential rain triggered flash floods that tore through Pakistan’s northwestern Swat Valley over the weekend, killing at least 32 people and laying bare gaps in disaster preparedness in a region once ravaged by Taliban.Twelve members of one family were swept away while picnicking along the river in Swat, witnesses said. Phone videos showed relatives clinging to rocks, screaming for help as waters surged around them. “We kept dialling the emergency numbers, but no one came. By the time they did, it was too late… we were pulling out bodies,” local vendor Kabeer said.The family had travelled from Mardan and remained trapped for over an hour with no rescue teams arriving. “This valley has lived through terrorists, military operations, and devastating floods.

Rescue operations are ongoing,” a rescue official said.Swat, now a bustling tourist hub, largely escaped the catastrophic 2022 floods that killed over 1,700 nationwide. This time, towns like Bahrain and Kalam, packed with riverside hotels, had little buffer when waters surged. Entire stretches transformed into danger zones within minutes.Pakistan has championed climate justice on global stages, yet its domestic disaster response remains stretched thin. “Each year we mourn our dead, patch up the roads, and brace for the next disaster,” said Liaquat Bacha, a farmer whose fields were washed away.","Torrential rain triggered flash floods that tore through Pakistan’s northwestern Swat Valley over the weekend.

At least 45 people have been killed across Pakistan as heavy rain and flash floods battered multiple regions since the start of the monsoon season, disaster management officials said on Sunday. The death toll includes a large number of children, underscoring the human cost of intensifying climate-related disasters in the country.The worst-hit was the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, bordering Afghanistan, where 21 people, including 10 children, lost their lives. The Swat Valley alone accounted for 14 deaths, where local media reported that a flash flood swept away families gathered near a riverbank.In Punjab, Pakistan’s most populous province located along the Indian border, 13 people have died since Wednesday. Officials said eight of them were children, killed when walls or roofs collapsed during intense rainfall. The remaining victims were caught in sudden floods.Another 11 fatalities have been reported in Sindh and Balochistan, further highlighting the widespread impact of the seasonal downpour.The Pakistan Meteorological Department has warned that heavy rainfall and the risk of flash floods will persist until at least Saturday, urging residents in vulnerable areas to take precautions.This latest tragedy follows a string of extreme weather events in Pakistan. Just last month, 32 people were killed in violent storms, and earlier in the year, the country faced hailstorms and unusual temperature shifts during spring.With a population of over 240 million, Pakistan ranks among the world’s most climate-vulnerable nations. Scientists and disaster experts have repeatedly warned that climate change is accelerating the frequency and severity of extreme weather, putting millions at risk in the region.Rescue and relief efforts are ongoing, and authorities have appealed for public vigilance as the monsoon deepens.","At least 45 people have been killed across Pakistan as heavy rain and flash floods battered multiple regions.

Another earthquake struck Pakistan on Sunday morning, with 4.5 magnitude, said the National Center for Seismology (NCS). This is the second quake that hit the nation in the same dayThe quake occurred at a shallow depth of 10 kilometers, which makes it prone to aftershocks and can cause stronger ground shaking.The NCS shared the details in a post on X, “EQ of M: 4.5, On: 29/06/2025 08:02:51 IST, Lat: 30.24 N, Long: 69.86 E, Depth: 10 Km, Location: Pakistan.”There were no immediate reports of injuries or major damage.

It occurred at a depth of 150 kilometers.Prior to these two events, another earthquake measuring 4.4 on the Richter scale hit the region on June 15. Like Sunday’s later tremor, it was also shallow, recorded at a depth of 10 kilometers.Shallow earthquakes tend to be more dangerous than deeper ones because their seismic waves have less distance to travel before reaching the surface. This leads to stronger ground shaking, which can cause greater structural damage and increase the risk of casualties.Pakistan is among the most seismically active nations in the world, as it is crisscrossed by several major fault lines. As a result, earthquakes occur frequently and are often severe.Geologically, Pakistan sits at the intersection of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates. The provinces of Balochistan, the federally administered tribal areas, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Gilgit-Baltistan lie along the southern edge of the Eurasian plate, while Sindh, Punjab, and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir are located on the northwestern edge of the Indian plate.The ongoing collision between these plates makes the region highly susceptible to powerful earthquakes.","The quake occurred at a shallow depth of 10 kilometers, which makes it prone to aftershocks and can cause stronger ground shaking.

At least 14 soldiers were killed and over 24 others injured in the attack, according to officials.A 'fidayeen' rammed an explosives-laden vehicle into a mine-resistant vehicle belonging to the bomb disposal unit, a source said. The explosion caused widespread damage and the casualties. Security sources said over 500 kg of explosives was used in the attack to breach an ambush protected vehicle.The Hafiz Gul Bahadur (HGB) group, linked to the Afghan Taliban, has claimed responsibility for the attack, attributing it to their ongoing operation 'Khandak'.

Heart-wrenching footage has emerged showing several people stranded on a narrow elevated strip in the middle of Pakistan's Swat River, moments before a deadly flash flood swept them away on Friday morning.The video, which went viral across social media platforms, captures their desperate cries for help as torrents of water surge around them.At least nine people from a single extended family lost their lives in the tragedy, according to Geo TV.The victims, including children, had gathered near the riverbank for breakfast while on a leisure trip from Sialkot. According to officials, the group was unaware of the sudden rise in water levels caused by heavy rains upstream.“They were taking selfies, and there wasn’t much water at the time,” said a family member, as quoted by news agency Reuters. “Suddenly, a massive wave came and swept them all away”, the member added.As per Swat deputy commissioner Shehzad Mehboob, 17 individuals were caught in the floodwaters. “We have recovered nine bodies so far and rescued four people alive. The search for the remaining four is ongoing,” he was quoted as saying by Geo News.Among the dead were women and children. Residents said it took over two hours for rescue teams to arrive at the scene.The devastating moment prompted an outpouring of grief in Sialkot, where the bodies of seven victims were received by wailing family members. “My children were calling for help in front of my eyes. We couldn’t save them,” said a distraught relative.The Pakistan Army has since joined local rescue teams, while the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government has ordered a high-level inquiry to investigate the lapses. The committee has been given seven days to submit its report and recommend preventive measures.According to Reuters, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority has warned of continued heavy rains and potential flash floods across northern Pakistan until next week.Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed sorrow over the tragedy, calling it a “painful reminder” of nature’s fury and urging tourists to follow safety advisories, as cited by Reuters.Heavy rains have affected parts of Pakistan since earlier this week, blocking highways and damaging homes.However, weather forecasters predict that the country will experience less rainfall compared to 2022, when climate-induced downpours caused rivers to swell and flooded one-third of Pakistan, resulting in 1,739 fatalities.","At least nine people from a single extended family lost their lives in the tragedy.

Pakistan continues to 'sleepwalk' on climate change- former minister





Flash floods in Pakistan's northwest mountainious province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have killed 11 people, including four children, the country's disaster management officials said.""In the past 24 hours, flash floods and landslides have claimed the lives of 11 people, including four children and three women, while six others have been injured,"" the provincial disaster management authority said in a report released late Friday.One person was killed in the Malakand district while the 10 others were killed in the Swat Valley, according to the report. Local media reported that families had been swept away and that the flooding had damaged 56 houses along the Swat river.Pakistan's local daily newspaper Dawn reported that rescue operations were underway in several other districts with people trapped in the water.Meanwhile, the national meteorological department warned of heavy rainfall and a possibility of more flash floods until Tuesday.Pakistan is among the world's more vulnerable countries to the effect of climate change with an increasing frequency of flash floods and other climate-related events impacting its 240 million inhabitants.In May, some 24 people were killed in severe storms in Pakistan. In August 2022, a third of the country was flooded due to unprecedented monsoon rainfall with more than 33 million people affected. Scientists from across the globe have since said that the climate crisis was to blame and that rising global temperatures will only make monsoons more intense in future.Pakistan's former climate change minister Sherry Rehman took to X, saying that the nation continued to ""sleepwalk"" on climate change and the threat it posed. She pointed to regular alerts issued by the national disaster management agency and said that local authorities had failed to take them seriously.""Not only did the provincial administration fail to understand the magnitude of the crisis, I keep repeating, so did denialist tourists. This is endemic to a system that thinks that climate change can just be put on a back burner, or that crises will not multiply in scale and intensity,"" she wrote.""These are not ""natural disasters"" which absolve all actors of responsibility, local, national and global. Super monsoons and flash floods are not the norm. They have been intensifying for decades,"" she added, urging the country to ""wake up"" the to the issue.","Flash floods in Pakistan's northwest have killed 11 people, including four children.

Where are scam centers spreading?

Who are the victims?

Who are the people traffickers?





Human trafficking-fueled scam centers have significantly expanded their operations worldwide, according to a crime trend update released on Monday by the international police agency Interpol.Hubs where trafficking victims are forced to take part in online fraud first emerged in a few Southeast Asian nations, but investigators are now also uncovering similar fraud centers in other regions.According to the international police organization, victims now come from 66 countries across all continents, highlighting what Interpol describes as a "" global crisis "" involving hundreds of thousands of people.Scam centers are now increasingly found in other regions, including the Middle East, West Africa, fast emerging as a new regional hub, and Central America.Victims are often lured with fake job offers and then held captive in scam compounds. Many are blackmailed over alleged debts, beaten, sexually exploited, and in some cases tortured or raped.Inside these centers, they are forced to run online scams, mostly targeting people abroad to steal money.A 2024 Interpol-led operation exposed dozens of cases where victims were coerced into committing fraud, including a raid on an industrial-scale scam centre in the Philippines.That same year, police dismantled a centre in Namibia where 88 youths were forced to scam others.Emerging technologies are fuelling this trend further. The crime update notes a surge in the use of artificial intelligence, from generating fake job ads to creating deepfake profiles for ""sextortion"" and romance scams.Interpol says the pool of those preyed upon has widened significantly.While early human trafficking victims were mainly Chinese-speaking and came from China, Malaysia, Thailand or Singapore, people are now being trafficked to such hubs from South America, East Africa and Western Europe.""Tackling this rapidly globalizing threat requires a coordinated international response,"" said said Interpol's acting head of police services Cyril Gout.The report found that about 90 per cent of human trafficking facilitators came from Asia, while 11% were from South America or Africa.About 80 per cent of these facilitators were men, with 61 per cent aged between 20 and 39.Online scam centers were initially concentrated in Cambodia, with additional trafficking hubs later uncovered in Laos and Myanmar. Today, similar operations have been identified in at least four more Asian countries, and evidence shows the model is spreading to other regions such as West Africa, where cyber-enabled financial crime is already common.In its findings, Interpol warned that the spread of such criminal networks needs urgent, coordinated action to disrupt trafficking routes and support victims.Interpol said that these criminal hubs are increasingly intertwined with other major transnational crimes, demanding a globally coordinated response.Trafficking routes used for scam centers are being exploited for smuggling drugs, firearms, and endangered wildlife like tigers and pangolins, Interpol said.","Human trafficking-fueled scam centers have significantly expanded their operations worldwide.

Dhaka: The alleged rape of a 26-year-old minority Hindu woman in Bangladesh's Cumilla district by a ""supporter"" of former PM Khaleda Zia's BNP has sparked widespread outrage, with the High Court directing that the video of her assault, which went viral on social media, be removed immediately and she be given police protection.Fazar Ali has been arrested on the charge of rape while four others are accused of making and circulating the video, said authorities, who have also been directed to ensure medical support to the woman. HC asked them to file a report within 15 days on the progress of investigations into the Thursday night incident. The video surfaced online on Saturday night.Condemning the incident and demanding exemplary punishment, BNP secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir said there is a ""dangerous conspiracy afoot to damage BNP's reputation"". The party is yet to clarify whether Fazar was linked to it. Fakhrul claimed the woman was a Hindu expatriate's wife.Fazar, after the Sheikh Hasina-led Awami League govt's fall last year, started introducing himself as a BNP member and attending its programmes, according to sources in political parties. He's seen in photos of BNP's Ramchandrapur South Union office's inauguration on Dec 14 last year.University students, including in Dhaka, held marches in solidarity with the victim, calling for justice.While Naripokkho, a women's rights body, called on citizens to break silence and resist violence against women, human rights organisations such as Ain o-Salish Kendra and Manusher Jonno Foundation called for ""swift trial and exemplary punishment"".The woman filed a case on Friday. She said she had come with her children to visit her parents, and on Thursday night, Fazar came to her house and asked her to open the door. When she refused, he broke the door, entered the house and raped her, according to authorities.","Fazar Ali has been arrested on the charge of rape while four others are accused of making and circulating the video.

Dhaka: Bangladesh will observe Aug 5 as 'Mass Uprising Day' to mark the movement that led to the ouster of the Sheikh Hasina govt last year. The interim govt, however, on Sunday withdrew its decision to dedicate Aug 8 to celebrate the formation the Muhammad Yunus-headed caretaker administration, following criticism from various quarters.Yunus took charge as chief adviser on Aug 8, three days after the fall of the Awami League govt and former PM Hasina resigning and fleeing to India. Following a meeting of the council of advisers, chaired by Yunus, chief adviser's press secretary Shafiqul Alam said, ""There will be no special celebration for Aug 8 as there will be no 'Notun Bangladesh Dibosh (New Bangladesh Day)'.""","Bangladesh will observe Aug 5 as 'Mass Uprising Day' to mark the movement that led to the ouster of the Sheikh Hasina govt last year.

Earthquake jolts Nepal: Magnitude 4.2 earthquake strikes Nepal; susceptible to aftershocks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/earthquake-jolts-nepal-magnitude-4-2-earthquake-strikes-nepal-susceptible-to-aftershocks/articleshow/122142126.cms,"Earthquake of magnitude 4.2 strikes Nepal (ANI)





An earthquake of magnitude 4.2 on the Richter scale jolted Nepal on Sunday, according to a statement released by the National Center for Seismology (NCS).The statement noted that the earthquake is susceptible to aftershocks, as it occurred at a shallow depth of 10 km.In a post on X, the NCS said: ""EQ of M: 4.2, On: 29/06/2025 14:19:05 IST, Lat: 29.35 N, Long: 81.94 E, Depth: 10 Km, Location: Nepal.""Shallow earthquakes, such as the one that struck Nepal on Sunday, are typically more dangerous than deeper ones. In such cases, tremors are felt much closer to the Earth's surface, increasing the potential for widespread damage to life and property. In contrast, tremors from deeper earthquakes tend to lose intensity before reaching the surface.Nepal has a long history of seismic activity, with the devastating 2015 earthquake, which claimed thousands of lives, still fresh in public memory. The country lies in the Himalayan region, a zone of intense seismic activity, caused by the ongoing collision between the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates.This collision leads to the Indian plate sliding beneath the Eurasian plate, a process known as subduction, which builds up immense pressure and stress within the Earth’s crust.The subduction zone amplifies this stress, making Nepal particularly vulnerable to earthquakes.The ongoing tectonic collision also contributes to the uplift of the Himalayan mountain range, further adding to seismic activity in the region.Earlier on April 26, a minute of silence was observed in memory of the 8,969 victims who lost their lives during the deadly 2015 earthquake in Nepal. Nepali Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli stood beneath the replica of the Dharahara Tower, which collapsed during the 7.8-magnitude earthquake a decade ago, and paid tribute to those who perished in the disaster.","An earthquake of magnitude 4.2 on the Richter scale jolted Nepal on Sunday.

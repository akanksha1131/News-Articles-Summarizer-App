‘THIS IS VIOLENCE’: Global Backlash As Brazil Opens Amazon To Oil Drilling On COP30 Eve





A fire broke out at the COP30 climate summit in Belem, Brazil, on Thursday, forcing thousands of delegates to evacuate and halting negotiations at a critical moment in the two-week conference.Ironically, the blaze appears to have been caused by electrical equipment, likely a microwave — showing that even a summit dedicated to climate action doesn’t always follow its own rules.The blaze began around 2.00 pm (1700 GMT) in an exhibition pavilion. Security footage later showed flames racing up an internal fabric shell lining the walls and ceiling, burning a hole through the roof as smoke filled the corridors and people ran for the exits shouting “fire!”Firefighters said the incident was brought under control within six minutes. Nineteen people were treated for smoke inhalation and two for anxiety, according to the Brazilian presidency of the event.Firefighters and ambulances arrived with sirens blaring as smoke rose from the tents and permanent buildings hosting diplomats, journalists, and activists. The affected area was sealed off with a large sheet, and delegates were escorted in one by one to retrieve belongings, including passports needed for evening flights.Plenary sessions will not resume until Friday.It was the third major incident since the summit began last week, following peaceful demonstrations by Indigenous protesters who first stormed the venue and later blockaded the entrance. COP30 hosts Brazil and United Nations Climate Change said in a joint statement that security responded “swiftly” and the blaze was controlled quickly.After a fire department inspection, Brazil declared the site reopened at 8.40 pm.The disruption hit at a delicate stage in the negotiations, with ministers struggling to break a deadlock over fossil fuels, climate finance, and trade measures. Delegates remain divided over Brazil’s proposed “roadmap” to transition away from fossil fuels, as well as concerns about weak emissions-reduction plans and funding for developing nations.Earlier in the day, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned negotiators that “the world is watching” and urged them to reach an “ambitious compromise.” He also welcomed calls for clarity on the disputed issue of weaning the world off fossil fuels.With less than 24 hours before the summit’s scheduled end, nearly 200 countries are still working to reach consensus. Brazil has described securing a final deal as vital to accelerating global climate action and turning years of promises into meaningful progress.","A fire broke out at the COP30 climate summit in Belem, Brazil, on Thursday, forcing thousands of delegates to evacuate.

Candace Owens links Erika Kirk to Egyptian planes in new claim





Candace Owens shared new doubts after the death of Charlie Kirk . She said she has not seen any proof that Erika Kirk, Charlie’s wife, has lied about anything. Owens spoke about this on Myron Gaines’ podcast. She said the day before Charlie Kirk was killed, he had sent a message to a person at Turning Point USA about a death threat. Candace Owens said this message made her worry even more about what happened inside the group. She also said some people at Turning Point USA were ready to make Mikey McCoy the “new Charlie,” which she found strange right after Charlie’s death.Candace Owens said Erika Kirk may look quiet or cold to some people online, but she believes this can happen when someone is in shock. She said Erika may be on “autopilot” because she is scared. Owens added that anyone would feel fear after seeing someone close get killed. She also said she has not found anything bad about Erika Kirk in her own checks. After this interview, Ben Shapiro and Steven Crowder said Owens was trying to attack Erika Kirk. Owens pushed back. She said Shapiro lied when he claimed she accused Erika of murder. She said this was made up and not true.Candace Owens also shared a new theory about two Egyptian military planes. She said these planes crossed paths with Erika Kirk’s travel records 73 times from 2022 to 2025. She said one plane was at the Provo Airport on the day Charlie Kirk was shot. Owens said a person helping her check flight paths spent many hours looking at the records and believed the planes were following Erika, not Charlie.Candacw Owens said she later checked more files and found even more overlap between Erika Kirk’s travel and the two planes. She said this made her believe that something larger may be happening around the couple. She added these overlaps happened long before Charlie was killed.On the podcast, Candace Owens also questioned the story of the shooter. Police named Tyler Robinson as the person who shot Charlie. Owens said she believes he may be a “patsy.” She claimed more people may have touched the gun and said the full truth has not come out yet.Owens ended by saying she is not blaming Erika Kirk at all. She said her main concern is the group around Charlie Kirk and the strange events linked to the planes and the shooting. She said the case still feels unclear and more answers are needed.Also Read: Candace Owens drops explosive claim on Charlie Kirk's assassination with shocking twist about Tyler Robinson fingerprints","Candace Owens shared new doubts after the death of Charlie Kirk.

Hegseth meets Nigerian NSA: Pentagon talks follow Trump’s ‘guns-a-blazing’ threat; tensions rise,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hegseth-meets-nigerian-nsa-pentagon-talks-follow-trumps-guns-a-blazing-threat-tensions-rise/articleshow/125474925.cms,"US Secretary of War Pete Hegseth (Photo credit: AP)





US Secretary of War Pete Hegseth and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine planned to held a closed-door meeting with Nigeria’s National security adviser Mallam Nuhu Ribadu at the Pentagon on Thursday evening, amid tensions sparked by President Donald Trump ’s threat to send American troops into Nigeria, ABC news reported.This follows Trump’s warning earlier this month that the US could launch swift military action if Nigeria failed to curb attacks on Christians.Trump’s post on his social media platform directed the Pentagon to prepare for potential operations saying “If the Nigerian Government continues to allow the killing of Christians, the USA will immediately stop all aid and assistance to Nigeria, and may very well go into that now disgraced country, ‘guns-a-blazing,’ to completely wipe out the Islamic Terrorists who are committing these horrible atrocities,” Trump posted on social media. “I am hereby instructing our Department of War to prepare for possible action. If we attack, it will be fast, vicious, and sweet, just like the terrorist thugs attack our CHERISHED Christians!”, a message to which Hegseth publicly replied, “Yes sir” adding “the Department of War is preparing for action.""Independent conflict-monitoring organisations say tens of thousands of civilians have been killed in Nigeria in recent years in violence affecting both Christians and Muslims, according to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project.Nigeria has rejected Washington’s decision to re-designate it as a “Country of Particular Concern” over alleged religious-freedom violations, with President Bola Ahmed Tinubu saying the characterisation “does not reflect our national reality. ”Deploying US ground troops to Nigeria would pose major logistical and political hurdles, given the country’s vast terrain, porous borders and expected public resistance. The US has around 6,500 military personnel across Africa, but no permanent troop presence in Nigeria. Drone operations in the region have also become harder after the US was forced to vacate key counterterrorism bases in neighbouring Niger following a military coup, officials earlier noted.A senior State Department official told CNN the 'high-level' Nigerian delegation’s visit had created an opening for “frank conversations,” adding that Washington wanted to help make Nigeria safer “for religious communities of all stripes.”US lawmakers have also pressed Abuja for demonstrable action. Rep. Riley Moore said he had conveyed that the US expected “tangible steps” to prevent violence against Christian communities.Sources cited by CNN said Nigeria had shown a greater willingness to work with the US military following Trump’s warning, with US Africa Command prepared to deepen cooperation if requested.With meetings underway both at the Pentagon and Capitol Hill, officials on both sides signalled an urgent effort to prevent the dispute from spiralling into a full-blown crisis.The meeting, confirmed by two defence officials, did not feature on the public schedules of either Hegseth or Caine, and Mallam Nuhu Ribadu’s visit to the Pentagon was kept closed to the press.",US Secretary of War Pete Hegseth and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen.

Fire disrupts COP30 in Brazil: Belem venue evacuated; key climate talks stalled,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/fire-disrupts-cop30-in-brazil-belem-venue-evacuated-key-climate-talks-stalled/articleshow/125474638.cms,"Flames engulf pavilions at the COP30 UN Climate Summit.

The venue hosting the COP30 UN climate talks in Belem has reopened after a fire forced an evacuation earlier in the day, Brazilian officials said Thursday night. In a statement, authorities said they had “restored operating conditions at the conference venue,” and confirmed that negotiations will resume on Friday, AFP reported.This follows after a fire ripped through several pavilions at the COP30 climate summit in Belem on Thursday, triggering evacuations and stalling negotiations just as delegates entered a decisive phase.The blaze, which tore through the roof of a temporary structure at the entrance to the venue, sent thousands of attendees fleeing as smoke rapidly filled enclosed corridors, according to AFP.Organisers said the fire was extinguished within six minutes, but 13 people were treated for smoke inhalation and the entire site was shut down until late evening, reported the Associated Press. The incident occurred on the penultimate day of the conference, where nearly 200 nations are attempting to resolve disputes over fossil-fuel transition, climate finance and trade-linked measures.Around 4.20 pm, the COP30 presidency said the blaze had been brought under control “with limited damage,” but confirmed that delegates would not be allowed back into the negotiation halls until later Thursday evening, reported The New York Times.Early accounts suggested the blaze started near the Africa pavilion, The New York Times reported. However, Brazil’s tourism minister Celso Sabino later said it appeared to have ignited close to the China Pavilion and may have been caused by an electrical short circuit or generator failure, according to AP. Video from the scene showed flames punching through canvas rooftops as fire crews rushed in.The venue is a mix of massive tents and semi-permanent structures built on a former airfield and had faced criticism all week for leaks, sweltering temperatures and exposed wiring. Stiell, the UN climate chief, had earlier flagged safety and security concerns to the Brazilian presidency, according to AFP.NYT also reported that parts of the site were still being completed even as the summit opened, with exposed beams and unfinished corridors.Amid the rush to escape, local volunteer Gabi Andrade said she saw black smoke spreading overhead as security personnel guided people to the exits. “It’s so sad for us… we all worked so hard,” she said.The summit has drawn thousands of participants from nearly 200 countries, who are attempting to reach agreement on accelerating cuts to planet-heating emissions.With the venue cordoned off, several delegations shifted to virtual meetings as officials assessed damage and tried to ensure the talks could resume before the summit’s scheduled close.",The venue hosting the COP30 UN climate talks in Belem has reopened after a fire forced an evacuation earlier in the day. 13 people were treated for smoke inhalation and the entire site was shut down until late evening.

President Donald Trump on Thursday called six Democratic lawmakers as “traitors” and called for them to face execution after they released a video telling members of the US military they have a duty to refuse illegal orders.Trump reposted an article about the video on Truth Social, adding: “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!”Earlier, he wrote: “This is really bad, and Dangerous to our Country. Their words cannot be allowed to stand. SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR FROM TRAITORS!!! LOCK THEM UP???”The video was released on Tuesday and featured Senators Elissa Slotkin and Mark Kelly, both former military personnel, and Representatives Jason Crow, Maggie Goodlander, Chris Deluzio and Chrissy Houlahan. They warned service members and intelligence officials that the Trump administration was putting institutions at risk and undermining the Constitution. “We know you are under enormous stress and pressure right now,” said Kelly. “Our laws are clear: You can refuse illegal orders.” Slotkin concluded: “We need you to stand up for our laws, our Constitution. Don't give up the ship.”Following Trump’s posts, Slotkin wrote on X that she and her colleagues would continue to defend the Constitution.“No threat, intimidation, or call for violence will deter us from that sacred obligation,” she said.Top Democrats condemned Trump’s remarks as a direct threat and a potential incitement to violence, reports news agency Reuters. Senator Chris Coons said: “Calling for the execution of senators and members of Congress for reminding our troops of that is chilling behavior we should expect from authoritarians ... not the president of the United States. Every one of my Republican colleagues needs to stand up and swiftly condemn this. ”Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer added: “When Donald Trump uses the language of execution and treason, some of his supporters may very well listen. He is lighting a match soaked with gasoline.”Under US law, civilians cannot be charged with sedition, though “seditious conspiracy” carries a maximum penalty of 20 years. For military personnel, the Uniform Code of Military Justice includes sedition charges that can carry the death penalty.","Six Democratic lawmakers released a video telling members of the US military they have a duty to refuse illegal orders.

Visa Breach Ends India Visit for Blacklisted UK Scholar and Hindi Literature Expert Francesca Orsini





: PoK-origin UK home secretary Shabana Mahmood announced Monday that Trump-style visa bans will be imposed on countries unless they accept the return of their criminals and illegal immigrants, as she revealed further sweeping reforms to tackle illegal immigration.The first countries to face such a ban are Angola, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of Congo whose nationals will no longer be granted UK visas unless their govts rapidly improve cooperation on removals. “These countries face penalties for their unacceptably low co-operation and obstructive returns processes. Thousands of illegal migrants and criminals from these nations are currently in the UK,” the home office said.Non-cooperation includes embassies failing to process removals paperwork in time and requiring individuals to sign their own documentation — allowing them to block their own deportation.India is thought to be one of several other countries most resistant to taking back illegal migrants and could join the list over the coming year, the Times (UK) reported.Human rights laws will also be overhauled to scale up deportations and prevent migrants from “gaming the system”.UK’s govt will legislate to reform how Article 8 (the right to family and private life) is interpreted by the courts to make clear a family connection means immediate family, such as a parent or child — blocking people from using dubious connections to stay in the UK. It will also work with partners at the Council of Europe to address the “over-expansive application” of Article 3 (protection against inhuman and degrading treatments) which migrants are also using to block their removal and introduce new legislation to crack down on “migrants making last-minute bogus modern slavery claims”. Migrants will be restricted to arguing all legal grounds within a single appeal and, if they lose, they will be forced to leave.New capped work and study routes for genuine refugees will be created who will be referred through partners such as the UNHCR. British people will be encouraged to house them, as they have done for Ukrainians, to end the reliance on asylum hotels, which cost £2.1 billion in 2024-2025.In the year ending June 2025 a total of 5,475 Indian nationals claimed asylum in the UK making them the sixth-largest nationality. Of these, 346 Indians arrived by small boat illegally. The other Indians were mostly on visas, with student visas being the most common. The top nationality to claim asylum was Pakistani; followed by nationals from Afghanistan, Iran, Eritrea and Bangladesh.Only 20 Indians were granted asylum in the year ending June 2025, and 2,691 had their claims refused.","Angola, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of Congo will face visa bans unless they accept the return of their criminals and illegal immigrants.

‘Desperate’ For Saudi-Israel Ties, Trump 'IGNORES' Pentagon's China Threat; Okays 48 F-35 Jets Deal





US President Donald Trump said on Monday that his administration would move ahead with the long-anticipated sale of F-35 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia, despite internal concerns that the deal could expose sensitive American technology to China.When asked whether he would approve the sale, Trump said, “I will say that we will be doing that. We’ll be selling F-35s.”The announcement came a day before Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s expected arrival in Washington, his first US visit in over seven years. The F-35 deal is among several major agreements the two countries are likely to unveil during the visit, according to AP.The crown prince is expected to seek formal US assurances on military protection for the kingdom and the purchase of the F-35, one of the world’s most advanced fighter jets.The timing of the announcement also reflects Trump’s push to secure a normalisation deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel. He has promoted an expansion of the Abraham Accords as key to long-term regional stability while the fragile Gaza ceasefire holds. “I hope that Saudi Arabia will be going into the Abraham Accords very shortly,” he told reporters on Air Force One on Friday.However, Saudi Arabia has maintained that any deal must include a guaranteed pathway to a Palestinian state, a position Israel firmly rejects.Officials say Riyadh is unlikely to join the accords immediately, though there is guarded optimism about a possible agreement by the end of Trump’s second term.The New York Times reported that a Pentagon intelligence assessment raised fresh concerns that China could gain access to sensitive F-35 technology if the sale proceeds. Sources familiar with the Defence Intelligence Agency’s findings said US officials fear potential Chinese espionage and Beijing’s growing security cooperation with Riyadh. Washington has also been evaluating whether the sale would affect Israel’s qualitative military edge, given Israel is the only Middle Eastern country operating F-35s and has used them in strikes in Iran in October 2024 and June 2025.Bradley Bowman of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies said Congress may now seek clarity on what assurances Riyadh has offered regarding its ties with China. He added that lawmakers are likely to press the administration on how it plans to maintain Israel’s military advantage in the region.",US President Donald Trump said on Monday that his administration would move ahead with the long-anticipated sale of F-35 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia.

Trump 'knew about the underage girls'?











Mark Epstein, the brother of the late pedophile Jeffrey Epstein , has tried to shut down a viral rumour about the newly released Epstein emails. He said that the name “Bubba” mentioned in a 2018 exchange between the brothers was not a reference to former President Bill Clinton.The clarification came after a March 2018 email between Jeffrey and Mark Epstein was released this week by Democrats, which stirred a row. In the message, Mark asked Jeffrey, who had said he was with Steve Bannon, to “ask him if Putin has the photos of Trump b*****g Bubba.” Because Clinton was long known by the nickname “Bubba”, the reference was speculated by many as Trump having oral intercourse with Clinton.Mark Epstein pushed back in a statement to The Advocate, saying the message was being misread. “They were simply part of a humorous private exchange between two brothers and were never meant for public release or to be interpreted as serious remarks,” he wrote. He added, “For the avoidance of doubt, the reference to ‘Bubba’ in this correspondence is not, in any way, a reference to former President Bill Clinton.”Mark's spokesperson, Ali Clark, said in an email that Bubba is “a private individual who is not a public figure.”Mark said that attaching political motives to a nickname distracts from “the serious questions that remain unanswered.”The wider set of emails points to far more serious claims about Jeffrey Epstein’s political ties with the MAGA chief. In a 2019 message to author Michael Wolff, Epstein wrote that Trump “knew about the girls as he asked Ghislaine to stop.” Another email from 2011, sent to Ghislaine Maxwell, claimed that Trump spent hours at Epstein’s home with one of his sex-trafficking victims.California Representative Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, said the documents raise “serious new questions” about Trump’s ties to Epstein and accused the Justice Department of obstructing the inquiry. “There’s a massive cover-up at the White House and the DOJ right now over the files.”The White House has dismissed the emails, with press secretary Karoline Leavitt rejecting any suggestion of Trump being involved in the Epstein scandal.Meanwhile, Trump also claimed that Bill Clinton spent significant time on Epstein’s island and threatened to launch an FBI and DOJ probe into various high-profile figures, including JPMorgan and Chase.The row intensified on Friday when Trump launched a Truth Social rant attacking Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene after she backed a bipartisan move to force the release of all unclassified Epstein files.","Mark Epstein, the brother of the late pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, has tried to shut down a viral rumour about the newly released Epstein emails.

On Cam: Dem Lawmaker’s ‘Texts’ With Epstein Inside U.S. Cong Sparks Fury; Explosive Plaskett Link





Former Harvard University president and US treasury secretary Larry Summers has said he will step back from several public roles following the release of documents detailing years of personal correspondence with convicted sex offender and disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.In a statement issued by him on Monday night, quoted by The Washington Post, Summers said he was “deeply ashamed” of maintaining contact with Epstein and accepted full responsibility for what he called a “misguided” decision. He said he would continue his teaching duties but would retreat from other commitments as part of an effort to rebuild trust and mend ties with people close to him.“I am deeply ashamed of my actions and recognize the pain they have caused,” Summers said. “I take full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr. Epstein. While continuing to fulfill my teaching obligations, I will be stepping back from public commitments as one part of my broader effort to rebuild trust and repair relationships with the people closest to me”, he added.His announcement comes in the wake of the House Oversight Committee’s release of a fresh set of documents detailing Epstein’s extensive interactions with political leaders, influential figures and long-time associates.While much public attention focused on Epstein’s comments about Donald Trump, the material also shed light on his communications with Summers.According to a report by The Guardian, emails exchanged between the two from 2013 to early 2019 show Epstein and Summers discussing politics, personal matters and Summers’s own relationships. In several of the exchanges, Epstein offered advice on Summers’s attempts to pursue a woman. The final messages were sent only months before Epstein’s arrest.The Centre for American Progress said Summers was no longer a fellow and confirmed that the planned launch of an economic working group he was to help lead had been put on hold as Summers continued to remain under public scrutiny. The Yale Budget Lab said he had withdrawn from its advisory group. Other organisations with which he is affiliated, including economic think tanks, did not immediately issue public comments.Summers, who served as Harvard University president from 2001 to 2006 and continues as a professor, faced renewed calls for the university to distance itself. Senator Elizabeth Warren, herself an emerita Harvard professor, told CNN that the institution should sever ties. Harvard did not respond to requests for comment.Epstein donated more than $9 million to Harvard and its affiliated programmes between 1998 and 2008 and briefly held a visiting fellowship that the university later found he was unqualified for.Summers has previously acknowledged regretting his dealings with Epstein. The release of the latest documents has revived scrutiny over the depth and duration of their relationship.","Larry Summers has said he will step back from several public roles following the release of documents detailing years of personal correspondence with disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.

"Sheikh Hasina sentenced to death, Dhaka reiterates extradition call; India non-committal",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/death-penalty-for-hasina-dhaka-wants-her-back/articleshow/125398370.cms,"Ousted Bangladesh PM Hasina Calls ICT’s Death Sentence ‘Rigged’, Says It Denied Fair Trial Rights

.

.





Deposed Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina was Monday sentenced to death in absentia for the violent 2024 student crackdown by a special tribunal in a verdict that she described as a foregone conclusion. Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus hailed the verdict saying no one is above the law.Hasina had called the tribunal a kangaroo court and, as she told ToI before the verdict, one that was controlled by her political adversaries looking to deflect attention from their governance failures.India responded to Hasina’s sentencing with caution as it said in a statement that it had taken note of the verdict by the ""International Crimes Tribunal of Bangladesh” and, as a close neighbour, remained committed to the best interests of the people of Bangladesh, including in peace, democracy, inclusion and stability in that country.“We will always engage constructively with all stakeholders to that end,’’ said the external affairs ministry in a statement, giving nothing away on Dhaka’s renewal of its demand immediately after the sentencing for the extradition of the deposed PM who remains in India.The government has so far only acknowledged the interim government’s call for her extradition, while remaining non-committal on what it proposes to do about it.That has been its position since December last year, when Dhaka officially sought her extradition, and it’s unlikely to comply with any such request in haste now as Hasina’s dramatic death sentencing does little to change the situation on the ground as far as India is concerned.The 2013 extradition treaty with Dhaka in any case may provide immunity to Hasina from any political witch hunt. Article 6 of the treaty states that extradition can be refused if the offence for which it is requested is of a political character. While Dhaka will argue that the same article excludes murder from the list of such offences, Article 8 also states that a person may not be extradited if he can convince the requested state that the accusations against him were not made in good faith “in the interests of justice”.In short, extradition would be a complex and long-drawn-out process and, for India, entail both legal commitments and geopolitical considerations. The sentencing will likely only add another layer of complexity to Hasina’s case. As an aspiring great power, India would not like to be seen as giving up on a longtime ally who remained attuned to India’s economic and security interests, not least by keeping in check radical Islamists. Abandoning Hasina would also not just demoralise Hasina’s party Awami League, which is facing a ban from participating in the upcoming elections, but also energize radical anti-India forces.The unelected interim government has also done little to assuage India’s concerns about increasing radicalisation and safety and security of minority communities. India also knows that Dhaka’s ongoing efforts to revive the relationship with Pakistan can act as real conundrum for India soon, even as it engages the interim government by hosting the Bangladesh NSA for a security conclave this week.More than the fate of Hasina perhaps, India will be concerned about what the verdict might mean for Awami League as it seeks free, fair and inclusive polls in the country. Hasina told ToI last week that the ban came from an unelected cadre that seized power and now wanted to take its political opponents out of the game.“It was the Awami League that introduced key reforms to ensure transparency and fairness, including- the use of photo-based voter lists, see-through ballot boxes, and the establishment of an independent election commission. There is an irony that the only party which ensured free elections is now barred from participating,” she said. For India too, it’s imperative that Awami League be allowed to contest elections that are genuinely fair and inclusive.","Deposed Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina was Monday sentenced to death in absentia for the violent 2024 student crackdown.

His colleagues, who have watched him grow from a beginner to a beloved team member, surprised him with a lavish red-carpet tribute and a generous $40,000 gift, celebrating an incredible journey of commitment and camaraderie.





An Indian-origin McDonald’s worker in Saugus, Massachusetts was celebrated in a big way after completing 40 years at the same restaurant, earning a $40,000 gift and a red-carpet evening from colleagues who call him “family”.Pargan Singh, also known to everyone as “Balbir”, first joined the Saugus McDonald’s when he moved to the United States. He recalled starting with basic tasks and slowly building his way up. “I worked in the kitchen, helping in the back, taking the trash, tried to do everything step by step. So I came in the front, they promoted me after three or four months to become a swing manager,” he said.Lindsay Wallin, the current owner of the restaurant, said Singh originally worked for her father and has remained an important person in the business ever since. She now runs four McDonald’s locations and considers Singh one of the organisation’s strongest pillars. “I was just excited to be able to hire Balbir and carry on with our organisation, and with our company, and he’s just such a pillar in our company,” she said.To honour his 40 years of service, Singh was taken for a limo ride and treated to a special dinner where staff rolled out a red carpet, reports Boston News. At the event, he was presented with a cheque for $40,000 as a gesture of gratitude.Wallin said celebrating him was an easy decision. “He’s just a great guy, he’s committed to the business, he’s committed to his employees, they all call him ‘papa bear’, they love him. It was just a no brainer to go big for him, for sure,” she said.For Singh, the reason he stayed so long is simple. “It’s kind of family, just put it that way. You know, that’s why I’m here so long,” he said.","Pargan Singh, an Indian-origin McDonald's worker in Saugus, Massachusetts, celebrated 40 years at the same restaurant.

What did Trump say about helping to end war in Sudan?





United States President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he intends to turn his focus to helping find a resolution to the civil war in Sudan between the army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF).The announcement came after Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman used his first trip to Washington in seven years to urge the US leader to intervene in the conflict.According to Trump, the war, which began in 2023, ""wasn't on my charts"" before the dialogue with the crown prince.""His majesty would like me to do something very powerful having to do with Sudan,"" he said at a business forum with the Saudi royal.In response, Sudan's sovereign council, which is led by army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, said it would be willing to cooperate with the US and Saudi Arabia to bring peace.In a statement, Fattah al-Burhan expressed a ""readiness to seriously engage with them to achieve the peace that the Sudanese people hope for.""According to the Republican president, his belief — prior to the crown prince's intervention — was that the war in Sudan ""was just something that was crazy and out of control.""Although the conflict had apparently not made it onto Trump's radar, behind the scenes, many within the US government had been making concerted efforts to find a way towards peace.As recently as November 14, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio called the UAE's foreign minister to ask Abu Dhabi to back a Sudan ceasefire.The fighting for control of Sudan has killed over 40,000 people and is said to have displaced over 14 million people.At a lunch with Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman and a number of Saudi business leaders, Trump said the Middle Eastern country's leader had told him ending the conflict ""would be the greatest thing you can do, that would be greater than what you've already done.""Speaking to the crown prince, Trump added: ""I see how important that is to you, and to a lot of your friends in the room, Sudan. And we're going to start working on Sudan.""Saudi officials reportedly expressed concerns to Washington that continued unrest in Sudan could lead to instability in the Red Sea and Africa, while creating conditions for extremist groups to move into the Middle East.",US President Donald Trump says he wants to help find a resolution to Sudan's civil war.

Indian-origin author Deepak Chopra named in newly released Epstein files: Who is he and what do the emails show?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/indian-origin-author-deepak-chopra-named-in-newly-released-epstein-files-who-is-he-and-what-do-the-emails-show/articleshow/125469195.cms,"

Who is Deepak Chopra ?

Epstein’s network





Newly released documents from Jeffrey Epstein’s digital archive have revealed an exchange between the late pedophile and Indian-origin author Deepak Chopra.The documents were released by Democrats last week, increasing pressure on Washington to make the full Epstein records public. The House recently passed the Epstein Files Transparency Act in a 427–1 vote, and the Senate approved it by unanimous consent. With Trump now signing the bill into law, the Justice Department will have 30 days to release all unclassified Epstein-related files.The email exchange dates back to November 2016, shortly after reports emerged that a woman named Katie Johnson had withdrawn a civil lawsuit in which she accused Donald Trump of raping her when she was 13 at an alleged Epstein-hosted gathering. Trump’s lawyers denied the original claims. The lawsuit was dropped before any formal hearings took place.According to the files, Epstein sent Chopra a news link about Johnson withdrawing the case. Chopra replied by asking Epstein whether Johnson had also withdrawn the separate allegations she had made against Epstein himself. Epstein responded with a short message, to which Chopra replied, “Good.” The released records show no further conversation between the two.The emails contain no evidence of business dealings, financial ties or personal involvement between Epstein and Chopra beyond this exchange.Deepak Chopra is an Indian-American author, public speaker and prominent figure in alternative medicine and wellness. Born in New Delhi and trained as a physician before moving to the United States in the 1970s, he rose to global prominence through best-selling books that blend spiritual philosophy with holistic health concepts.Chopra remains widely followed, particularly among audiences interested in mindfulness, meditation and integrative health. Over the years, he has built a substantial global brand through retreats, wellness centres and collaborations with public figures, including Oprah Winfrey.The latest disclosures form part of a broader wave of document releases connected to Epstein’s associates, communications and activities. Since his death in 2019, thousands of pages of material have offered insights into the scale of his outreach to political leaders, executives, academics and cultural figures.There are no allegations of wrongdoing against Deepak Chopra in relation to Epstein. The messages do not indicate that he participated in or had knowledge of any illegal activities. His brief appearance in the email archive appears to stem from Epstein forwarding a news article during a moment of high public attention.Chopra has previously acknowledged meeting Epstein in professional or social settings, as did many public figures, but has denied any improper association.","Newly released documents from Jeffrey Epstein’s digital archive have revealed an exchange between the late pedophile and Indian-origin author Deepak Chopra.

Trump again defends foreign worker inflow as MAGA base bristles,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-again-defends-foreign-worker-inflow-as-maga-base-bristles/articleshow/125468150.cms,"Saudi Crown Prince MBS (left), US President Donald Trump (ANI)

The TOI correspondent from Washington:





US President Donald Trump doubled down on his support for foreign skilled labor at a US-Saudi investment forum on Wednesday, presenting the need for overseas professionals to train American workers in high-tech manufacturing as part of his MAGA agenda even as his base bristled with resentment at his framing.Speaking alongside Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Trump declared, ""I love MAGA – This IS MAGA!"" as he defended the need for foreign workers. But his remarks, which explicitly welcomed ""thousands of people"" from abroad to staff multibillion-dollar chip factories, sparked a fierce backlash from MAGA loyalists who accused him of abandoning ""America First"" principles in favor of “tech bros” and globalist donors, while insisting the US has enough talent for the jobs.In remarks that were parsed endlessly in MAGA-sphere, Trump linked the trillions in investment he claims to output from immigration stance, arguing that without foreign expertise, projects arising from the inflow would stall. ""You can't open a massive computer chip factory for billions of dollars, like in Arizona, and think you can hire people off an unemployment line to run it,"" he said. ""They have to bring thousands of people and I will WELCOME those people."" The framing is in line with expert opinion that the US lacks talented workforce in niche areas.""Those people will teach OUR people how to make computer chips. And in a short period of time, our people will do great and those people can GO HOME!"" Trump insisted, positioning the policy as a bridge to long-term American dominance. He referenced a real-world example, recounting how he halted an immigration raid on South Korean engineers at a Georgia battery plant, telling officials: ""Stop it. Don’t be stupid.”But many MAGA faithful expressed skepticism insisting that current policy is not geared towards sending foreign workers back, even as they expanded their fight to stop even foreign college admissions which they say provides another channel for immigration. Trump has also made known his support for the inflow of foreign students, saying they are needed to keep American universities solvent.The MAGA supremo acknowledged the political tightrope, quipping, ""I may take a little heat from my people, the people that love me. They happen to be toward the right of center. Sometimes WAY right."" He dismissed critics as ""unbelievable patriots"" who ""just don’t understand our people need to be taught,"" adding that his poll numbers might dip but rise among ""smart people.""Traditionally, surveys show that Trump polls better among the less educated voters and his numbers dip among college graduates. The foreign workers issue, part of the larger debate on immigration, looks set to become a lightning rod in the mid-term Congressional elections a year from now.","US President Donald Trump doubled down on his support for foreign skilled labor at a US-Saudi investment forum on Wednesday.

'No Talent In U.S.': Trump BURNS MAGA Base For India Reset? What It Means For Indian Workers





US President Donald Trump defended the use of skilled foreign workers, H1-B visas at the US-Saudi Investment Forum in Washington on Wednesday, saying they are essential to getting large technology projects up and running and that he would “welcome those people”, a stance that was not appreciated by the MAGA base.Speaking at the event, Trump pointed to a planned computer chip factory in Arizona as an example, arguing it was unrealistic to expect employers to hire from the unemployment line for highly technical roles. He said, “You can't come in, open a massive computer chip factory for billions and billions of dollars like is being done in Arizona, and think you're gonna hire people off an unemployment line to run it. They're gonna have to bring thousands of people with them and I'm gonna welcome those people. I love my conservative friends, I love MAGA, but this is MAGA.”The president's comments follow weeks of debate inside conservative circles after he told Fox News that the United States lacks talent for certain specialist industries and needs to bring in skilled workers to train American labour. At the forum he repeated that message, saying foreign experts will teach Americans to operate advanced factories and that this is in the national interest.Hardline MAGA supporters accused Trump of abandoning his America First promise by appearing to side with corporate interests and foreign labour. While some Republicans had the GOP leader's back.Congresswoman and former Trumo loyalist Marjorie Taylor Greene blasted POTUS’s H-1B remarks, saying American students were being “pushed aside for foreign tech workers”, while right-wing political activist Laura Loomer claimed the president was being steered into “globalist policy”. Nick Fuentes called the stance a “betrayal of the movement”, arguing that MAGA voters never asked for more imported labour. Tesla CEO Elon Musk took a softer line, saying the US still needs top-tier engineers for chip factories but urged companies to train Americans instead of relying on “permanent visa pipelines”. Indian-origin MAGA ally Dinesh D’Souza defended Trump as “pragmatic”, and Vivek Ramaswamy argued that specialised roles can’t be filled overnight.Earlier in September, Trump had floated a $100,000 price tag for a national “talent challenge,” arguing that America would need to invest heavily to compete with China and rebuild critical industries. That message now sits awkwardly beside his defence of H-1B visas.","US President Donald Trump defended the use of skilled foreign workers, H1-B visas at the US-Saudi Investment Forum in Washington on Wednesday.

""We Are Done..."" Trump Recalls Critical Modi Call That Averted India-Pakistan Nuclear Clash





US President Donald Trump is insisting Prime Minister Narendra Modi called him to end the war against Pakistan after he (Trump) threatened a 350 percent tariff against both countries. The claim comes on the heels of a congressional report crediting Pakistan's battlefield “success” to Chinese weaponry and accusing Beijing of exploiting the chaos for geopolitical gain, even as Trump is hawking US arms across the world, Saudi Arabia being the latest recipient.Trump’s narrative on settling the India-Pak war, which gets more elaborate with each telling (more than 60 times so far), included Modi calling him to say “We’re done” with the war, which in the US President’s view would have gone nuclear and resulted in nuclear dust over Los Angeles. New Delhi has repeatedly denied there was any call between the two leaders during or immediately after the short four-day clash.Trump’s assertions, which get more embellishments with each recall, came hours after a two-page analysis in the 2025 Annual Report to Congress by the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission (USCC) – a bipartisan panel mandated to scrutinize Sino-American security dynamics – framed Pakistan's ""military success"" as a showcase for Beijing's arsenal, which constitutes 82% of Islamabad's arms imports from 2019–2023.""Pakistan’s military success over India in its four-day clash showcased Chinese weaponry,"" the document asserts, citing the combat debut of HQ-9 surface-to-air missiles and Wing Loong II drones that reportedly intercepted Indian incursions. “While characterization of this conflict as a “proxy war” may overstate China’s role as an instigator, Beijing opportunistically leveraged the conflict to test and advertise the sophistication of its weapons, useful in the contexts of its ongoing border tensions with India and its expanding defense industry goals,” the report said. It also spotlights pre-conflict Sino-Pakistani drills: the Warrior-VIII land exercises in October 2024 and the AMAN-2025 naval maneuvers in February, which honed interoperability in contested airspace.The disquisition on Chinese arms comes even as Trump, a self-professed peacemaker, boasts frequently about the primacy and sophistication of U.S military hardware, hawking it to allies in Europe, the Gulf, and East Asia. Earlier this week, the Trump administration notified Congress its approval for the sale of Javelin anti-tank system and Excalibur projectiles to India in a $93 million contract -- chump change compared to the billions in sales it is lining up for Saudi Arabia. The U.S is also trying to wean Pakistan away from Chinese military dependence.The USSC report meanwhile alleged that post India-Pak ceasefire, Beijing orchestrated a sophisticated disinformation blitz to undermine western arms. Using AI-generated deepfakes and morphed imagery, Chinese state-linked actors flooded social media with fabricated footage of Rafale jets malfunctioning, aiming to erode French arms sales in South Asia, it said. This ploy reportedly swayed Indonesia to suspend a $8.1 billion Rafale deal in June 2025, redirecting interest toward China's J-35 stealth fighter. ""The conflict drew global attention to the China-Pakistan defense nexus,"" the report warns, underscoring escalation risks in a nuclear flashpoint where miscalculation could cascade regionally.The report also looks at the “asymmetry” in the degrees to which China and India prioritize establishing a long-term solution to their border dispute. In recent years, it says, the Indian government has increasingly recognized the seriousness of the threat posed by China at the border—and that it is not merely “acne on the face,” especially as China’s military has strengthened.“It remains to be seen whether China’s and India’s 2025 commitments are a short-term function of India’s desire to hedge against tumult in trade negotiations with the United States or are a long-term shift toward normalization in bilateral relations,” the report says, reflecting on the Modi-Xi meeting in Tianjin.","US President Donald Trump is insisting Prime Minister Narendra Modi called him to end the war against Pakistan.

Nalin Haley, son of former US ambassador and South Carolina governor Nikki Haley , has called for strict limits on international students entering American universities, warning that some may be acting as “spies for foreign governments.”Speaking in a recent interview with Tucker Carlson, the 24-year-old Indian-origin argued that the United States must prioritise native-born Americans as part of a “America First” agenda.Haley also repeated his claim that naturalised citizens should not be allowed to hold public office, insisting that only those raised entirely in the United States can fully understand the country’s values. He went further, calling dual citizenship a “stupid idea” and arguing that individuals with ties to another nation should not serve in the US military. Nalin has been an active anti-immigrant loudmouth which some of the MAGA base respects.Earlier this month, Nalin also called to end H-1B visas and halt all legal immigration. Haley has argued that foreign workers are taking opportunities from young Americans, saying that several of his own friends with strong educational backgrounds are still struggling to find jobs. He directly linked this unemployment to an oversupply of migrant workers.His comments come as Donald Trump has taken a softer stance on H-1B visas, saying the US government cannot stop the influx of foreign skilled workers because the country “lacks talent” and needs immigrants to fill crucial sectors such as technology and defence. The MAGA base has attacked the US president for going back on his “America First” agenda, but the White House has defended Trump.","Nalin Haley, son of former US ambassador and South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, has called for strict limits on international students entering American universities.

The proposals revive and expand efforts from Trump’s first term, many of which were blocked by courts or reversed by the Biden administration, and would reshape how threatened and endangered species are protected.Under the new plan, federal agencies would gain greater authority to consider economic impacts when designating critical habitats. Environmental organisations say this marks a significant shift from the ESA’s long-standing practice of relying primarily on scientific evidence when determining habitat needs. Critics argue the change could increase development pressures in ecologically sensitive areas by opening them to mining, drilling, logging and other industrial projects.The proposal would also narrow the definition of “critical habitat” by excluding areas not currently occupied by a species, even if those landscapes were historically part of their range or could be necessary for future recovery. Scientists caution that this approach may limit the ability of species to adapt to changing conditions, including climate-related shifts in habitat.Trump officials argue that the Endangered Species Act has become overly restrictive and needs to be realigned with its original intent, claiming that automatic protections for threatened species, broad habitat designations and consideration of future climate threats impose unnecessary burdens on landowners, states and key industries.The administration also seeks to change how regulators account for future threats, such as projected climate impacts. Environmental advocates say this would make it harder to protect species whose habitats are expected to become threatened in the coming decades.Another major change involves removing the long-standing “blanket rule” that automatically grants newly listed threatened species the same protections as endangered ones. Instead, protections would be created on a species-by-species basis. Conservation groups argue this could result in delays at a time when many species are experiencing rapid declines. Observers also note that staffing constraints within wildlife agencies could exacerbate the time needed to complete these tailored rules, although the administration has not directly linked staffing levels to the proposed changes.Environmental groups were quick to condemn the proposal. Stephanie Kurose of the Center for Biological Diversity said the package “creates a blueprint for the extinction of some of America’s most beloved wildlife”, pointing to species such as wolverines, monarch butterflies and Florida manatees as being particularly vulnerable. Critics describe the plan as part of a broader pattern of efforts to reduce environmental protections in favour of increased resource development.Administration officials dispute that characterisation, arguing the revisions bring the ESA closer to its original framework while easing regulatory burdens on landowners and industries. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said the rules would protect species while respecting “the livelihoods of Americans who depend on our land and resources”. Fish and Wildlife Service director Brian Nesvik said the administration supports “conservation that works hand in hand with America’s energy, agricultural and infrastructure priorities”.The proposals arrive at a time when species worldwide are facing increasing pressure from habitat loss, climate change, pollution and human activity. A 2019 assessment by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services estimated that around one million species are at risk of extinction. Scientists warn that the loss of a single species can have cascading effects on broader ecosystems, especially when keystone species decline.With a new 30-day comment period opening on Friday, environmental organisations are preparing for another robust public response. Kristen Boyles of Earthjustice said the administration “misjudges the public’s commitment to protecting wildlife”, arguing that most Americans do not want protections weakened in ways that could benefit corporate interests.","Proposals would reshape how threatened and endangered species are protected.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk offered a bold view of the future, saying daily work could become optional within the next two decades as AI and robotics reshape daily life. Speaking at the US–Saudi Investment Forum, Musk said rapid advances in technology could make traditional jobs unnecessary for most people. “I do not know exactly what long-term means, perhaps 10 to 20 years,” he said. “My prediction is that work will be optional.”He compared future work to hobbies such as playing sports or video games, suggesting people may choose to work only if they enjoy it. According to Musk, people could still earn money, shop normally or even grow their own food.However, social media was very sceptical of such a hugely idealistic and optimistic idea, with users trolling Musk by comparing it to the film Wall-E. Meanwhile, left-wing X users argued that Musk’s vision would only ever be possible for the rich.Musk went a step further by suggesting that money itself may lose its importance if AI and robotics continue to improve. He said a future society might function without relying heavily on currency, although access to energy and raw materials would still set limits. He pointed again to Tesla’s Optimus humanoid robot, saying robots could become a larger industry than smartphones.The billionaire argued that use of advanced robots could help eliminate poverty by lowering the cost of labour and increasing productivity. “AI and humanoid robots will actually eliminate poverty,” Musk said, adding that many companies, not just Tesla, will eventually produce such machines.","Elon Musk says AI and robotics could make daily work unnecessary.

The dirt road into Odd, West Virginia, bends gently between tree lines and a seam of rusted fencing before opening onto the Whittaker property, a scatter of collapsing structures that look as though they have been exhaling for decades. The house, its siding warped by seasons, sits back from the road behind a porch where Halloween skeletons still dangle beside Christmas angels, their plastic limbs rattling in the slightest wind. Towels hang from a makeshift clothesline. Old tyres, crushed beer cans, chipped buckets and sagging refuse bins pool around the steps. The yard is littered with objects that once held purpose and now simply mark the passing of time.Inside, the air is thick with the smell of gas from a stove where beans and sausage have been left out, congealing as flies drift across the counters. The television blares in the background, absorbed by a room whose calendar remains frozen on March. Outside the window, beyond a collapsing chicken coop and several broken trailers wearing the weather like a permanent bruise, stands the family outhouse.This is the scene reporters from the Daily Mail encountered when they returned to the Whittakers’ home after the recent removals, the isolated West Virginia property long occupied by the Whittakers, widely known as America’s most inbred family, who have lived most of their lives out of public view and far from the wider community, and which once held seven or eight voices but now holds only two.Betty, seventy-three, and Larry, sixty-nine, occupy the house in the same unadorned way the house seems to occupy the land. Their days are quiet. Their relatives are gone. And they say they haven’t been told where.In September, three Whittakers, Ray, 72; his sister Lorene, 79; and Lorene’s son Timmy, 46, were removed from the family’s home in Odd, West Virginia by adult protective services, according to relatives who spoke to the. The operation was carried out quietly, and the two siblings left behind, Betty, 73, and Larry, 69, said no explanation was given to them at the time.Betty recalled being told only that the three relativesadding,She and Larry have had no contact with them since the day they were taken.Larry said he has received no information from authorities about their location or condition.he said.He believes the sudden intervention followed the enormous attention generated by online videos of the family.he saidOfficials from West Virginia’s Department of Human Services told the Daily Mail that they were “aware of the situation” but could not discuss the case “due to confidentiality laws.” The agency reportedly refused to comment further because of “the ongoing nature of the matter.”For the Whittakers, who lived most of their lives unseen by anyone outside their rural community, the shift from obscurity to global exposure, and now to forced separation, has left the remaining siblings without answers and without the family members they had cared for their entire lives.The Whittakers’ story stretches back more than a century through the wooded hills of West Virginia. Their inbreeding traces to a single marriage between two sets of cousins descended from identical twin brothers, a convergence that effectively folded the family tree in on itself.Their parents, according to The Sun, were “first cousins, twice, because they share both sets of grandparents.”Identical twin brothers Henry and John Whittaker had children who later married each other, beginning a cycle of consanguineous unions that persisted through generations.Scientists point to the predictable but devastating pattern known as “inbreeding depression,” a term that describes the expression of harmful recessive genes passed repeatedly through the same bloodline. A 2021 study by the University of San Francisco Valley, Brazil, noted that “There is an association between high rates of marriage between relatives and the development of congenital malformations, abortions, deafness, esophageal atresia, and mental and physical disabilities. ”The Whittakers exemplified these consequences. Lorraine and Ray often communicated through grunts rather than speech; one relative told filmmaker Mark Laita, “They understand what you talking about. If they don’t like it, they start yelling – let you know they don’t like that idea.” The family did not know their genetic issues were the result of inbreeding. When Laita pressed them about physical abnormalities in his earlier films, Kenneth once suggested, “Might be coal mining. ”Yet, for most of their history, the family’s struggles were private, until a filmmaker walked up the dirt drive.The Whittakers became a global spectacle in 2020 when filmmaker Mark Laita uploaded a twelve-minute documentary to his YouTube channel Soft White Underbelly. The video, meant to highlight “untold stories from across the country,” revealed the family’s living conditions and genetic isolation with an intimacy that shocked viewers. Laita described it asHe had first met the family in 2004 when he was taking photographs for his book. Even then, the encounter came with resistance: “protective” neighbours confronted him with a shotgun, he recalled on the Koncrete podcast, explainingOver the years he returned, filming more footage. Laita has compared the family to characters from the 1972 thriller. He said,The 2020 documentary drew tens of millions of views. Soft White Underbelly’s uploads turned the Whittakers from a sheltered, isolated household into a global curiosity. According to Laita, interest grew so quickly that he needed a police escort to return to the property.As viewers circled the videos, curiosity seekers began circling the house. Neighbours report that people regularly drove down the dirt track to film, photograph, or simply stare at the family’s home.For a clan that once fled from strangers, the world had suddenly arrived on their porch.With Ray, Lorene and Timmy taken by adult protective services, the house in Odd now holds only Betty and Larry, who continue living in what reporters described as squalid conditions: a stove left running, food cooling on the burners, insects moving across the counters, and a yard strewn with discarded items, broken structures and holiday decorations left out through the seasons. Betty has repeatedly said,Public reaction has been divided. Some accuse the internet of turning the family’s hardships into entertainment. One reader commented,Others expressed cautious relief:What the state is doing with the three relatives remains unknown. Under confidentiality laws, no agency has released any information about their location or welfare.Meanwhile, Betty and Larry remain at the property in Odd, carrying on in the home where they have lived for decades, and where they continue to wait for news about the family members removed without explanation.","Lorene, 79; Timmy, 46; Betty, 73; Ray, 72; and Larry, 69, were removed from the family’s home in Odd, West Virginia.

MTG, Massie Go Nuclear On Trump, Republicans During Fiery Epstein Vote; 'Intimidated By Own Party'

A populist coalition?





Right-wing commentator Nick Fuentes launched an aggressive attack on the Republican Party, saying the GOP should be “destroyed” and replaced with a new populist coalition that rejects foreign labour programmes such as H-1B visas.In a lengthy monologue, Fuentes claimed the current Republican leadership serves corporate donors and technology companies rather than American workers.Fuentes argued that the GOP has abandoned its base by defending immigration channels used by major industries. He said the party “still provide[s] for H-1B visas” and continues to support Chinese students, blaming this alignment with Silicon Valley for undermining wages and opportunities for young Americans.According to Fuentes, the party’s stance on immigration and foreign labour shows it is no longer acting in the interests of ordinary citizens. He said there are growing grievances within the nationalist MAGA base, arguing that Republican leaders have backed down on tariffs, maintained corporate tax cuts and supported the same labour pipelines used by big agriculture, hospitality and construction.For Fuentes, the H-1B system has become a symbol of how the party has sided with business over American workers.He called for a political realignment built on cooperation between nationalist Republicans and populist Democrats, describing it as a coalition that would prioritise borders, reduce foreign influence and challenge entrenched economic interests. Fuentes suggested that issues like the release of the Epstein files and ending foreign aid to Israel could unite both sides and that such a platform would have huge public support.The centrepiece of his proposal is what he calls a “populist compromise”: the left would “give up immigration”, including both legal and illegal inflows, and the right would “give up on the free market” by accepting a larger social safety net, healthcare intervention and public subsidies. He claimed this alignment could form a movement capable of winning “90 per cent of the vote”.",Right-wing commentator Nick Fuentes launched an aggressive attack on the Republican Party.

Trump Breaks Silence On Tucker Carlson’s Nick Fuentes Chat, Ignores Backlash





Indian-origin Nikki Haley 's son Nalin Haley stirred a row after telling Tucker Carlson that dual citizenship in the United States is the “stupidest idea” and that there is no grey line around national identity.Nalin is the son of former US Ambassador to the UN and former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley. The 24-year-old argued that a person can only belong to one country, saying “you’re either American or you’re not.”During the interview, Carlson asked whether people with ties to other countries should be allowed to serve in the US military. Nalin dismissed the idea entirely. “Hello no,” he said, calling the suggestion “insane.” He added, “Dual citizenship is bad enough, but to serve in the military is… disqualifying really.” Carlson responded, “Of course,” backing the stance.Nalin also said America should not permit dual citizenship of any kind. “People should have their loyalty to America first,” he said. Carlson is also a rigt-wing political podcaster who mostly agreed with the 'America First' stance of Nalin.Nalin's comments follow a series of hardline statements about immigration, foreign students and the H-1B system.Nalin has repeatedly blamed migrant workers and international students for limiting opportunities for young Americans. In an earlier Fox News appearance, he claimed he had seen his own friends lose out because foreign applicants snatch those places from them.Nalin has become a celebrated figure among sections of the MAGA base who oppose the presence of Indian and Chinese students in the US, even as Trump now argues that America lacks “talent” and needs skilled foreign workers for industries such as tech and defence.Carlson said that many of Nalin’s ideas are very different from the modern Republican Party, as most MAGA leaders now accept that the US economy needs foreign skilled labour in one way or another, with even Trump saying US lacks ""talent.""

How the Hate Machine Turned on Indians



Harold and Kumar go to White Castle - The American Dream





India has been intricately linked with the American story, even before it was conceived. Christopher Columbus thought he was looking for India when he rolled up to the Bahamas. Columbus, who died in penury, was later held up as the “founder” of America because the Americans needed a non-British origin story so they decided an Italian sailing under the Spanish flag was the “first American”, to the point that the indigenous people of the US continued to be referred to as Indian.The real Indians arrived later, most famously Bhicaji Framji Balsara, a Parsi gentleman from Mumbai who argued he should be naturalised as a “free white man.”Later in 1923, Bhagat Singh Thind, a World War 1 veteran – one of the millions of Indian soldiers upon which back the Allies won two World Wars – argued that Indians as “Caucasians” should qualify but the view was rejected by US Supreme Court and retroactively stripped citizenship of previously naturalised Indian immigrants (accounting for 3000) of them who were deported under the Asian Exclusion Act of 1921, who made their way back once the act was lifted in 1965.As comedian Nimesh Patel likes to joke, that didn’t work out too well for America who spent the hiatus studying American habits which made them the richest minority in country.His signature line: “They like to sleep, they like to eat, they like to drive. So they’re going to need gas stations, motels and cardiologists. Gas, beds and meds, baby” — summarises the improbable rise of a community that once slipped through America’s cracks and now stands awkwardly at its centre.Patel’s joke also captures the delicate equilibrium that existed for years — admiration at Indian usefulness, irritation at Indian ubiquity.Indians, for most of their American journey, were cast as the well-behaved immigrants: industrious, grateful, academically terrifying, economically cautious and socially quiet. As long as they occupied that box, America tolerated them with a kind of polite ambivalence. But the moment they stepped outside it — the moment they became too successful, too loud, too visible or too politically inconvenient — the temperature shifted.Signs of that tension were visible long before the recent hostility.And then came 2024, when it briefly looked like the Indian-American moment had finally arrived. Nikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy stood on the Republican debate stage. The Democratic nominee — late to the race and cautious about acknowledging her Indian half — still represented a milestone. The Trump administration had Indians scattered across powerful desks: Kash Patel as FBI chief, Sriram Krishnan as AI adviser, and Usha Vance as the first Indian-American Second Lady. Add to that a constellation of Indian-origin strategists, policy aides and tech whisperers embedded across agencies, and it felt, for a moment, like the Indian story had turned a decisive corner.It hadn’t.The early Indian immigrants built their standing by being quiet achievers — workers who did not challenge the social order, who accumulated modestly, who were grateful for opportunities, who avoided public confrontation, who worshipped discreetly and who habitually apologised even when they were the ones bumped into. That social contract has now broken, not because Indians changed dramatically, but because the country around them did.Even dyed-in-the-wool MAGA Indians have been attacked for their faith. Kash Patel, who chanted Jai Shri Krishna at his confirmation hearing, was asked to go back to his “land of demons” for wishing his followers a Happy Diwali. Vivek Ramaswamy’s family was relentlessly attacked at every turn.Dinesh D’Souza a well-known Trump ally was also shocked, to discover the MAGA rhetoric aimed at Indian-Americans asking who has legitimised this “vile degradation”.Even JD Vance – with the subtlety of a man looking forward to some time in the White House – assures his base that he’s “trying to convert” his Hindu wife to Christianity.A detailed analysis by the Centre for the Study of Organized Hate (CSOH) tracked 128 of the most-viewed posts attacking Indians on X between 22 December 2024 and 3 January 2025. Together, those posts had racked up 138.54 million views by 3 January. The detailed study of anti-Indian narratives online shows a surge in hostility across platforms. The data doesn’t just explain America’s psychology, but it does reveal the architecture of the backlash — the themes, the tropes, the fixations and the emotional logic behind the hate.Before diving into the numbers, it helps to understand where they come from. CSOH is a US-based research collective that tracks how coordinated hate networks form and spread across social platforms. Their study categorises the most viral narratives, identifies who spreads them, measures how fast the hate travels and shows how each spike leaves behind a higher baseline of resentment.The dominant narrative casts Indians not as contributors but as demographic invaders — the Great Replacement myth retold with STEM accents and H-1B visas. Alongside this sits the colonial repertoire: accusations about hygiene, smell, sanitation, cows, poverty, accents and food. These stereotypes, once the whispers of empire, now circulate as viral memes. The accusation of cheating sits lower, a reflexive suspicion that any Indian succeeding must have hacked the system.These threads change in flavour but not in essence. Americans admire Indian competence when they need it; they resent Indian success when it threatens established hierarchies.Yet none of this would matter if it were confined to fringe corners of the internet. It isn’t. The hostility is driven by visible, verified, monetised voices — accounts with large followings, cultural influence and a keen understanding that outrage is profitable.The irony is almost poetic. Silicon Valley intensifies this dynamic. There was a time when it seemed like every tech empire was helmed by someone named Sundar, Satya, Shantanu or Nikesh. This should have been a celebratory moment in the immigrant imagination. Instead, it unsettled those who saw in it not progress, but loss — a reshuffling of power that did not flatter them.And this is where a crucial truth emerges: Indians in America are now disliked by both sides of the ideological spectrum, for entirely different and mutually contradictory reasons.What makes this moment uniquely combustible is that the hostility arrives as a bipartisan gift. The Right dislikes Indians for being the wrong kind of successful — too brown, too numerous in elite professions, too visible in tech and politics, too confident for the comfort of those who believe success should preserve old hierarchies. The Left resents Indians because they are inconvenient to its moral architecture — too upwardly mobile to be victims, too socially conservative to be predictable allies, too economically entrenched to fit neatly into oppression frameworks. Indians have achieved the rare feat of annoying both camps, which is the clearest sign they are no longer a background community but a central, disruptive character in America’s national anxiety.Indians stopped being guests in the American dream. They began to look like landlords.And if the professional world irritates some Americans, the Indian presence on the internet actively terrifies them. The new generation of Indians online behaves like the most unruly branch of the digital tree — argumentative, sarcastic, fact-heavy, culturally fluent and often brutal in debate. They do not offer deference. They do not apologise for intelligence. They do not retreat from confrontation. This behaviour, while deeply entertaining to Indians, deeply unsettles audiences accustomed to silent minorities.The mechanism of how the hostility spreads is equally revealing.Each time an Indian-origin figure enters the news — whether an appointment, a viral clip, a political comment or a tech announcement — the system ignites. Engagement surges, stereotypes resurface and thousands of accounts ride the wave to amplify their own visibility. The spike ends, but the hostility never resets; it stabilises at a higher baseline, ensuring the next wave begins hotter than the last.Meanwhile, the offline world begins to reflect the online one. There are roadside protests targeting Indian families. Temple-goers harassed. Families told to “go home.” Restaurant patrons confronted. Politicians flirting with ancestry-based belonging. Immigration rhetoric turning explicitly racial. Anti-Indian sentiment is no longer an online nuisance; it is a civic reality.The model minority myth, once a shield, has become a weapon. Indians were applauded when they were quiet, appreciated when they were useful, tolerated when they were invisible, resented when they were visible, and now targeted when they are powerful.To pretend this backlash is about curry, cow dung, accents or call centres is to miss the point. Indians symbolise something far bigger and far more threatening to certain groups: the collapse of old hierarchies, the redistribution of professional influence, the emergence of a minority that refuses to sit quietly in the corner assigned to it.This backlash is neither sudden nor surprising. Every community that rose too fast — the Irish, the Jews, the Chinese, the Japanese, the Mexicans — encountered resentment before they were accepted. Indians have simply arrived at that stage earlier than expected, propelled by economic success, digital ubiquity and political prominence.And that is the tragedy of the moment. Indians are being targeted at the exact point they believed they had finally become American — not visitors, not outsiders, not exceptions, but insiders woven into the national story.But America has always had a complicated relationship with successful minorities. And Indians, with their STEM degrees, their corporate dominance, their digital swagger and their sudden political presence, have triggered a cultural whiplash. Indians thought they had won the American dream. America, meantime, is still trying to decide whether that dream belongs to them.And perhaps this is the real irony of the moment. America’s first encounter with “India” was a mistake — a navigational error that christened an entire continent and mislabelled its first peoples. Columbus wasn’t looking for a country, he was looking for a story. And when he couldn’t find the India he imagined, America simply invented one.Centuries later, the country is still struggling with the consequences of that confusion. Indians arrived, worked, studied, built companies, reshaped institutions and quietly rewired the American dream. Yet the old anxiety remains: that the India America once sought as an idea is now showing up as a reality — not in spices or trade routes, but in boardrooms, laboratories, campuses, ballot boxes and online spaces where Indians refuse to stay in the roles assigned to them.Columbus mistook another land for India and changed the course of history. Today, America is mistaking Indians for a threat and may end up doing the same. The tragedy is not that Indians are hated. The tragedy is that they are hated at the very moment their long, strange, improbable American journey seemed closest to belonging.For all the charts, all the data, all the narratives, it comes down to this: the country that once set out looking for India is now struggling to accept the Indians standing right in front of it.","India has been intricately linked with the American story, even before it was conceived.

A judiciary under reconstruction



Munir’s expanding power base



(With inputs from agencies)





Pakistan’s judiciary is in a moment of crisis as senior judges resign amid a contentious constitutional amendment reshapes the balance of power in favour of the military. Behind the crisis is the contentious 27th Constitutional Amendment, a sweeping package pushed through parliament within days. Lawyers, judges and opposition parties argue that it has weakened the courts and elevated the military’s top commander to a position with no modern parallel.Since then, Pakistan’s judiciary has been hit by a series of high-profile resignations. On Saturday, Lahore High Court judge Shams Mehmood Mirza stepped down, and his family said his decision was directly linked to the 27th Amendment. His departure followed those of Supreme Court justices Mansoor Ali Shah and Athar Minallah, who issued sharply worded letters condemning the amendment as a direct attack on judicial independence.The creation of a new Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) lies at the heart of judicial restructuring. The FCC now holds exclusive jurisdiction over constitutional matters, stripping the Supreme Court of its original powers. Pending petitions have already been shifted to the new court. President Zardari swore in Justice Aminuddin Khan as its first chief justice; six other judges were appointed, including serving Supreme Court and high court judges, though one judge reportedly refused to join.The FCC’s establishment has sparked intense concern. Critics say the president’s new power to transfer judges risks becoming a tool to sideline dissenting voices. Opposition groups argue this will fundamentally weaken judicial independence and concentrate constitutional authority in the executive and military leadership.Government ministers, however, hailed the package as “historic” and a step toward greater efficiency and national unity. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said the amendment proved that “solidarity” prevailed during a time of national strain.With judges resigning, courts being reconfigured, and the military gaining unprecedented constitutional control, Pakistan faces a moment of reckoning.The amendment passed with overwhelming numbers in both houses has dramatically restructured Pakistan’s defence architecture, elevating army chief Asim Munir to Chief of Defence Forces with command over all three military branches. His five-year tenure now resets from the date of notification, enabling him to remain in office until 2030.The Senate has since rushed through four related bills, including amendments to the Army, Air Force and Navy Acts, along with changes to Supreme Court practice rules. These laws remove the earlier equality among service chiefs and replace references to the Joint Chiefs of Staff system with a new “National Strategic Command”, further centralising military authority under Munir.Dawn reported that appointments, extensions, and tenures under these reforms “shall not be called into question before any court on any ground whatsoever”.Experts quoted in multiple reports warn that the shift risks internal military tensions and further erodes civilian oversight. Lawyer Osama Malik described the reforms as something “usually granted in absolute monarchies”, arguing they grant lifetime protections not only to Munir but also to President Zardari.Opposition lawmakers responded with uproar, shredding copies of the bill and walking out. PTI leaders labelled the move “deeply undemocratic” and “the final nail in the coffin of an independent judiciary”. Critics say these changes could reshape the political landscape, particularly for nearly 200 cases involving former prime minister Imran Khan.","Pakistan's judiciary is in a moment of crisis as senior judges resign amid a contentious constitutional amendment.

Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Powers Set To Grow As Shehbaz Govt Mulls 27th Constitution Amendment

Military reforms: Asim Munir at the helm



Judicial restructuring: Federal constitutional court



Political reactions



What next







Pakistan’s National Assembly on Wednesday passed the 27th constitutional amendment bill, granting sweeping powers to the military in general and country’s army chief Asim Munir in specific, and restructuring the judiciary.The vote, held amid a ruckus in the lower house, saw 234 lawmakers in favour and only four against, speaker Ayaz Sadiq announced. The session was attended by top political leaders, including Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, PML-N President Nawaz Sharif, and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari.The amendment comes at a time of heightened political tension in Pakistan, with the ruling coalition seeking to consolidate control over key defence and judicial institutions. The legislation follows earlier Senate approval, where it received 64 votes in favour and no opposition, as the opposition benches boycotted proceedings.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif hailed the passage as a demonstration of national unity, saying the house exhibited solidarity. He also condemned a recent terrorist incident in Wana, drawing parallels to the Army Public School massacre, and praised law enforcement for securing the safety of students and cadets.The amendment elevates Pakistan army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir to the newly created role of Chief of Defence Forces, giving him constitutional authority over all three branches: army, navy, and air force. Honorary five-star ranks such as field marshal, marshal of the air force, and admiral of the fleet remain lifetime titles. According to the country's law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, the reform “aims to bring constitutional oversight to defence appointments while preserving military honour and tradition.The bill also establishes a federal constitutional court (FCC) to handle constitutional and provincial matters, leaving the Supreme Court to focus on civil and criminal cases. The FCC will have equal representation from all provinces and the power to take suo motu notices on constitutional petitions. The Judicial Commission will oversee judge transfers; refusal of a transfer will be treated as retirement.The ruling coalition, including PML-N, PPP, MQM-P, and allies, backed the amendment. Opposition lawmakers condemned it as unconstitutional. PTI chairman Gohar Ali Khan called it the “Baku Amendments” and accused the government of undermining democracy. Mehmood Khan Achakzai of PkMAP protested by tearing a copy of the bill in the house.The amendment now returns to the Senate for final approval before becoming law. Analysts say the 27th amendment significantly strengthens Munir’s role in Pakistan’s military hierarchy while altering judicial oversight, marking a shift in Pakistan’s institutional framework.(With input from agencies, Dawn)","The amendment elevates Pakistan army chief Asim Munir to the newly created role of Chief of Defence Forces.

Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Powers Set To Grow As Shehbaz Govt Mulls 27th Constitution Amendment

Why it matters

The big picture

The Field Marshal’s expanding power evokes a hybrid of Pakistan’s two most dominant military rulers:

Ayub Khan, who introduced centralized presidential control and laid the foundations for military-led governance.

Zia-ul-Haq, who used the Army and Islamization to seize power, marginalize the judiciary, and suppress civilian opposition.

Munir is consolidating power not through martial law, but via constitutional amendments passed by a pliant parliament.

If Zia’s coup was loud and brutal against a strong popular leadership, Munir’s is silent, yet possibly more far reaching, being done through a political front office that’s pliant and dependent on the Army for authority. With Imran Khan in prison, any opposition will come from the streets and the troubled insurgencies to the west of Islamabad.

Pranab Dhal Samanta in the Economic Times

Zoom in

The transformation follows the India-Pakistan conflict in May 2025, a four-day exchange of air and missile strikes after the Pahalgam terror attack.

India’s Operation Sindoor targeted Pakistani airbases, radars, and command centers.

Pakistan requested a ceasefire after intense damage - a request reportedly initiated by Pakistan’s DGMO.

Donald Trump, who claimed to have brokered the truce(India has repeatedly denied the US President's claims), was effusively thanked by Munir and PM Shehbaz Sharif. Trump now calls Munir his “favorite field marshal.”

The Financial Times described their dynamic as a “bromance,” with Trump showcased on billboards across Pakistan alongside Munir and Sharif.

This international validation was followed by Munir’s promotion to Field Marshal, the second such promotion in Pakistan’s history - and the first codified under the Constitution.

Between the lines

This isn’t just about military command - it’s about rewriting the DNA of the Pakistani state.

The amendment creates a new Federal Constitutional Court, potentially diluting the powers of the Supreme Court and creating ambiguity about the hierarchy of judicial authority.

President Zardari is also granted lifelong immunity in the amendment, mirroring the legal shield given to Munir.

This dual protection signals a strategic alliance between the military and top civilian figures to institutionalize mutual insulation from accountability.

“Too much has been left to ad hoc and arbitrary decisions,” Mazari warned.

The domestic question: Can repression deliver reform?

The three-front storm: Taliban, TTP, and India

“If you nurture snakes in your backyard, they will bite you,” said Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, the Pakistani military’s official spokesman, referencing the Taliban. What a comeuppance : The remark could just as well apply to all Pakistan-grown terror groups and the TTP, whose resurgence is a grim case of blowback.

The bottom line





In Pakistan, where generals have often ruled with impunity and influence, Field Marshal Asim Munir is scripting a new playbook-quiet, precise, and constitutionally sealed. His rise is not just another chapter in the country’s well-worn saga of military dominance. It is, as one senior opposition leader put it, “a rewrite of the entire power manual.”Pakistan’s controversial 27th Constitutional Amendment proposes to recast the country’s military command structure by abolishing the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC) and creating the role of Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) - a position that will be held by the Army Chief, currently Field Marshal Asim Munir •The amendment vests unprecedented legal and constitutional power in the CDF, giving Munir operational and institutional control over the army, navy, and air force, as well as the country’s nuclear command.•It also grants five-star officers life-long rank, privileges, and immunity, a move seen as creating a parallel unelected authority beyond the reach of civilian or judicial oversight.“This amendment appears tailored to benefit a specific individual rather than to strengthen the defence structure,” Lt Gen Asif Yasin Malik, former defence secretary, told Dawn.The CJCSC post - created after the 1971 war to ensure coordination among services - will be dissolved on November 27, 2025, when the current chairman, Gen Sahir Shamshad Mirza, retires.The 27th Amendment represents the largest shift in Pakistan’s civil-military balance since the Zia era, codifying the military’s supremacy in a way that future civilian governments may struggle to reverse.•The military will no longer merely influence governance from behind the scenes - it will be constitutionally entrenched at the center of executive authority.•Strategic nuclear assets, previously overseen by the National Command Authority, will now fall under the commander of national strategic command, appointed by the PM on the army chief’s advice, and selected from within the army.“All nuclear weapons and delivery systems will be under army control, including second-strike missiles traditionally under the Navy,” warned Dr Shireen Mazari, former human rights minister, a Dawn report said.•The change grants the army a monopoly over promotions, transfers, and postings across the services, threatening morale and inter-service harmony.“If promotions in the Air Force and Navy are determined by an army-origin CDF, it could lead to festering resentments,” Mazari cautioned.At home, Munir is both omnipresent and embattled. According to a Financial Times report, his supporters compare him to Mohammed bin Salman or South Korea’s General Park - ruthless modernisers willing to bulldoze institutions in the name of reform. His critics, however, see echoes of Zia-ul-Haq’s theocratic militarism cloaked in constitutional legitimacy.The judiciary is already split, thanks to a proposed constitutional court that would dilute the Supreme Court’s power. Journalists are censored, civil rights groups are muzzled, and political opponents - most notably former Prime Minister Imran Khan - are jailed or silenced.And yet, Munir has cast himself as the architect of reform. In his speech at the Pakistan Military Academy, he spoke of “treasures hidden beneath our land” and claimed that Pakistan had begun to “regain its rightful place in the comity of nations.”But the economy tells another story. As per the FT report, Pakistan’s investment rate is the lowest in South Asia, its poverty rate has risen to 25%, and its youth unemployment is dangerously high. The country remains dependent on IMF bailouts and Gulf financing that has yet to materialise in promised volumes.While Munir consolidates power at home, Pakistan finds itself encircled by a resurgent triangle of threats - each historically rooted, each dangerously revived. In the west, the Afghan Taliban’s return to power in 2021 has proved more liability than leverage. Once covertly supported by Pakistan’s security establishment, the Taliban now resist Islamabad’s demands and turn a blind eye to cross-border attacks on Pakistani soil.More ominously, the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), an offshoot long declared outlawed, has regrouped in Afghanistan and resumed attacks in Pakistan’s tribal belt and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. This year alone, militant violence has killed over 1,400 people - the highest toll in a decade.“The military simply lacks political support on the ground there,” Iftikhar Firdous, founder of The Khorasan Diary, told FT. “The crackdown has alienated entire communities.”Simultaneously, Pakistan’s eastern border with India remains fragile after the four-day air conflict in May.Add to that domestic insurgencies in Balochistan and the Pashtun belt, and Pakistan now faces not one, but three overlapping security fronts. Instead of acting as a force-multiplier, the military’s expanding political and economic footprint is beginning to stretch its operational capacity thin.The 27th Amendment enshrines military supremacy in Pakistan's Constitution under the guise of reform and modernization.•It moves the country further away from parliamentary democracy, and deeper into military-led constitutional authoritarianism.•As Field Marshal Asim Munir prepares to become the first Chief of Defence Forces, Pakistan’s most consequential question remains: Can a military man fix a failing nation - or will history repeat itself?(With inputs from agencies)","Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Powers Set To Grow As Shehbaz Govt Mulls 27th Constitution Amendment.

ISLAMABAD: A suicide bomber killed 12 people outside a court in Islamabad on Tuesday in a sharp escalation of militant violence that the defence minister said had pushed the country into a ""state of war"".Pakistani govt ministers accused neighbouring Afghanistan of complicity in the bloodshed - an accusation Kabul denied - and vowed retaliation if Afghan authorities failed to rein in the militants Islamabad says were responsible. ""We are in a state of war,"" said defence minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif after the attack, the first strike on civilians in Islamabad in a decade. ""Bringing this war to Islamabad is a message from Kabul, to which Pakistan has the full power to respond. ""The bombing outside an Islamabad court also wounded 27 people interior minister Mohsin Naqvi said. The court bomber blew himself up near the entrance at around lunchtime. Images on local media showed people covered in blood lying next to a police van. A vehicle was seen on fire and another car was badly damaged. Police cordoned off the site. Naqvi said the bomber had tried to enter the court building on foot but, unable to find a way in, detonated the device outside, close to a police vehicle.Several of the wounded were in critical condition, a hospital source said.No group claimed responsibility for Tuesday's attack. The main Pakistani militant group, Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), denied involvement in the attacks. But a group affiliated with the Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, according to The Khorasan Diary, a digital platform in Islamabad that monitors militant activity in the region.TTP militants have in recent years focused attacks on security forces. Civilians had not been hit in Islamabad for a decade, according to Armed Conflict Location and Event Data, a group that tracks attacks.Islamabad says that the Pakistani Taliban and other militants are based in Afghanistan, with the support of India. ""We are totally clear that Afghanistan has to stop them. In case of a failure, we have no option but to take care of those terrorists who are attacking our country,"" Naqvi said, speaking at the scene of the court bombing. The Taliban administration spokesperson in Kabul did not respond to a request for comment on Pakistan's accusations.The court attack happened hours after militants stormed a school near the Afghan border on Monday. The attack on the school in Wana, in the north west, began Monday, when a suicide vehicle rammed the main entrance, killing three people, Naqvi said. Militants then entered the school, which is run by the military but educates civilians.By Tuesday evening, three militants were still inside the compound, security officials said, with rescue operations under way for the students trapped in another part of the school. Naqvi said that the school assailants were in contact with their handlers in Afghanistan during the attack.Reuters","A suicide bomber killed 12 people outside a court in Islamabad on Tuesday in a sharp escalation of militant violence.

Surge in militant violence and worsening ties with Afghanistan







Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif said the country was “in a state of war” after a suicide bomber struck outside the Islamabad district courts on Tuesday, killing at least 12 people and injuring 27.The blast one of the deadliest to hit the capital in recent years has intensified tensions with Afghanistan, with Asif accusing the Taliban government in Kabul of allowing militants to operate freely.In a post on X, Asif said: “Anyone who thinks that the Pakistan army is fighting this war in the Afghan-Pakistan border region and the remote areas of Balochistan should take today’s suicide attack at the Islamabad district courts as a wake-up call: This is a war for all of Pakistan.”He wrote that Pakistan’s military was making “daily sacrifices while providing citizens with a sense of protection and security”, but warned that hoping for negotiations with Kabul would be a “mistake”. Asif insisted that Afghanistan “has the ability to prevent terrorist attacks inside Pakistan” and that bringing the conflict to the capital was “a message from Kabul”.He added that Pakistan “has the strength to respond fully”, saying the attack had erased any remaining doubts about the threat posed by militants operating from Afghan soil.The explosion took place around midday in Islamabad’s G-11 district, just outside the judicial complex where hundreds of lawyers and visitors were present. Police said the attacker tried to enter the court premises but failed, eventually detonating explosives next to a police vehicle, igniting cars and sending a fireball through the street.Interior minister Mohsin Naqvi confirmed that 12 people were killed and 27 wounded. He said authorities had recovered a severed head believed to be that of the attacker, and CCTV footage captured him moments before the blast. Witnesses described scenes of chaos, with people screaming for help as ambulances rushed to the site.The blast comes amid a sharp rise in militant violence across Pakistan. Security officials say the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) has carried out hundreds of attacks this year, mostly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa near the Afghan border, but strikes in major cities have been rare. Islamabad was last hit by a suicide attack three years ago.On Monday night, militants also attempted to storm an army-run college in Wana, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Security forces killed two attackers quickly, while others were cornered inside an administrative building. Students and staff were evacuated, and the military said the assault resembled the TTP’s 2014 massacre in Peshawar that killed 154 people.Pakistan says the Afghan Taliban have allowed TTP fighters to take refuge across the border.

Deadlock Deepens: Afghanistan Calls Pakistan Irresponsible As Peace Talks Break Down Once Again





ISLAMABAD: Pakistan said on Sunday that it was committed to dialogue to resolve differences with the Afghan Taliban but demanded that Kabul must address concerns regarding the use of its territory by terrorists.Foreign Office (FO) spokesperson Tahir Andrabi issued a statement on different media queries regarding the third round of talks with the Afghan Taliban regime in Istanbul on November 6, which concluded a day later. Turkiye and Qatar mediated the parleys.The peace talks ended without any agreement to tackle the thorny issues of cross-border terrorism , the top officials had said on Saturday.""Pakistan remains committed to the resolution of bilateral differences through dialogue. However, Pakistan's core concern, i.e. terrorism emanating from Afghanistan, needs to be addressed first and foremost,"" the FO said in a statement.It also said that Pakistan's Armed Forces and its people were well determined to eliminate the menace of terrorism from its soil and take action against its supporters, abettors and financiers.In the long statement, the spokesperson said that for the past four years, since the Taliban regime came to power in Afghanistan, there has been a sharp surge in terrorist attacks emanating from Afghan soil.""Throughout these years, Pakistan, despite suffering military and civilian casualties, exercised maximum restraint and did not retaliate,"" it said.Pakistan's expectation was that the Taliban regime would be able to control these attacks and take concrete actions against the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan/Fitna al Khawarij (TTP/FaK) elements present on Afghan soil, the FO said.The Pakistan government last year notified the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) as ""Fitna al-Khawarij"", a reference to a group in earlier Islamic history which was involved in violence.Pakistan also tried to positively engage with Afghanistan by offering bilateral trade concessions and humanitarian assistance, and the intention to constructively engage with Afghanistan so as to enable it to become a stable, peaceful and prosperous country that is at peace within and with its neighbours, the statement said.However, despite all these positive gestures, ""the response from the Taliban regime has only been hollow promises and inaction,"" it added.Instead of acting upon the core expectation to stop Afghan territory from being used for attacks against Pakistan, the Taliban regime has always tried to shy away from taking concrete and verifiable actions, it said.""Instead, it has tried to confuse the main issue with other relatively irrelevant and hypothetical issues. By confusing the main issue of terrorism, it keeps trying to develop a narrative which absolves the Taliban regime of its commitments and responsibilities towards the international community and its own people,"" it added.The statement said that Pakistan's October 2025 response to the consistent attacks emanating from Afghanistan was a manifestation of the will and determination that it will not leave any stone unturned to safeguard its territory and its people.The statement added that the Taliban regime was only interested in prolonging the temporary ceasefire, but without taking concrete and verifiable actions against the TTP/FaK terrorists.Pakistan also accused the Afghan Taliban of using the issue of Pakistani terrorists hiding in Afghanistan as a humanitarian issue, adding that they had fled in 2015 to avoid a military operation and fought together with the Afghan Taliban against Nato troops.""These terrorists and their families are now being harboured by the Taliban regime as a payback for their allegiance to the Afghan Taliban,"" it said, and added that the same terrorists established training camps in Afghanistan to launch terrorist activities in Pakistan.The FO rejected the Kabul excuse of lack of control over TTP and demanded definite and concrete actions. Pakistan also rejected the portrayal of TTP as refugees and asked Kabul to hand them over to Pakistan.It said Pakistan has never eschewed dialogue with any Government in Kabul, but it would not hold dialogue with any terrorist group.",Pakistan says it is committed to dialogue to resolve differences with the Afghan Taliban.

Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Powers Set To Grow As Shehbaz Govt Mulls 27th Constitution Amendment

What does it mean?



Opposition backlash and protests



Divided legal opinions



Support for reforms







Pakistan’s government has introduced a major constitutional change that has sparked widespread debate and protests across the country. The proposed 27th constitutional amendment, which will be voted on in Parliament next week, seeks to restructure the military’s chain of command and overhaul the judiciary, prompting strong criticism from the Opposition.The current move mirrors the era of General Zia-ul-Haq, Pakistan’s longest-serving de facto head of state, who introduced sweeping constitutional changes to entrench military control under a civilian façade. The proposed 27th Amendment, risks reviving that legacy by placing the armed forces once again at the centre of Pakistan’s political structure.The bill, tabled in the Senate on Saturday after cabinet approval, proposes to abolish the post of chairman joint chiefs of staff committee (CJCSC) and replace it with a new and more powerful position -- chief of defence forces (CDF).According to reports in Dawn, the post will be held by the serving chief of army staff, who will also become the constitutional head of the army, navy and air force. This change would make General Asim Munir the most powerful military officer in Pakistan’s history, formalising his recent promotion to Field Marshal.The amendment also includes plans to set up a new federal constitutional court (FCC) and change how high court judges are appointed.It seeks to transfer some powers from the Supreme Court to the new court, while also granting the president lifelong immunity from criminal prosecution.Pakistan law minister Azam Nazir Tarar presented the bill in the senate, where chairman Yusuf Raza Gilani referred it to a committee led by Farooq Naek for review. Naek said the goal was to “create consensus among members” before the bill comes up for voting on Monday. The government is confident of securing a two-thirds majority in both the senate and the national assembly.Opposition parties have strongly opposed the amendment, calling it a direct threat to Pakistan’s Constitution. A coalition of opposition groups, the Tehreek-e-Tahafuz Ayeen-e-Pakistan (TTAP), which includes Imran Khan’s PTI, Majlis Wahdat-e-Muslimeen (MWM), Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP), Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) and the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) has announced nationwide protests starting Sunday.“Democratic institutions have been paralysed within Pakistan… the nation must step up against the [proposed] 27th Amendment,” MWM chief Allama Raja Nasir Abbas said.PkMAP leader Mahmood Khan Achakzai said the protests would begin with the slogan: “Long live democracy, down with dictatorship.” He warned, “The opposition alliance had no choice but to launch a protest movement following the government’s move, which is shaking the foundations of the Constitution.”Legal experts are split on the amendment’s impact. Critics say it would reduce the powers of the Supreme Court, making it “irrelevant,” and tighten executive control over the judiciary.One senior counsel told Dawn, “Left with a limited jurisdiction of deciding ordinary civil, criminal and statutory appeals, the Supreme Court has now become all the more a ‘Supreme District Court’.”Former additional attorney general Tariq Mehmood Khokhar warned that the changes would “empower [the new] Federal Constitutional Court by disempowering the Supreme Court.” He said the amendment also gives the Chief of the Defence Forces constitutional authority for life, formally recognising the Field Marshal rank.Another lawyer pointed out that under the new Article 175A, the chief justice of the FCC would outrank the chief justice of the Supreme Court of Pakistan and serve until the age of 68 -- three years longer than the current limit of 65.Some legal experts, however, have welcomed the changes. Senior counsel Hafiz Ahsaan Ahmad Khokhar called the 27th Amendment “a major and long-awaited structural shift” in Pakistan’s justice system.He said the plan to have two separate apex courts -- one for appeals (Supreme Court) and one for constitutional cases (FCC) -- would bring “greater clarity, efficiency and constitutional coherence.”He also argued that the reforms could reduce political influence in the judiciary, cut down case backlogs, and modernise the justice system.Khokhar added that the new defence structure under Article 243 was in line with “modern constitutional democracies,” ensuring that the armed forces would operate under a single advisory framework accountable to the prime minister, defence minister and National Security Committee.Newly elected Supreme Court Bar Association in Pakistan, President Haroonur Rasheed also supported the creation of a Federal Constitutional Court, saying it could help streamline the judicial process.","Proposed 27th constitutional amendment will be voted on in Parliament next week.

Pakistan on edge: Jaffar Express services suspended over security fears; thousands affected,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-on-edge-jaffar-express-services-suspended-over-security-fears-thousands-affected/articleshow/125199650.cms,"Over the past 12 months, the Jaffar Express has become a repeated target for insurgent groups (AI image)

Blast Hits Jaffar Express in Pakistan, Several Injured

A train under siege



The months that followed saw a stream of attacks:

In October, a blast on the Sindh section of the railway line derailed five bogies and injured several passengers.

In September, an explosion on the track in Mastung derailed six coaches, leaving 12 injured.

In August, six coaches derailed after an improvised explosive device went off in Mastung, while days earlier a pilot engine came under gunfire.

In July and June, two separate blasts in Sindh derailed multiple coaches.

Late last year, a suicide bomber at Quetta Station killed at least 26 people.

Pakistan Railways has halted all operations of the Jaffar Express between Quetta and Peshawar for four days beginning Sunday, citing “serious security concerns” in Balochistan, news agency PTI reported.The temporary suspension — enforced from 9 to 12 November — follows multiple insurgent attacks on the train over the past year, including a dramatic hijacking in March that left 26 people dead.Railway officials said the move came after fresh intelligence warnings of possible attacks targeting tracks, railway assets and civilian passengers. “The precautionary measure is based on advice from security and intelligence agencies to ensure the safety of passengers, railway staff, civilians and critical rail assets,” a senior official said, as quoted by PTI.The Jaffar Express is one of Pakistan’s busiest long-distance routes, carrying thousands of passengers daily at a cost far lower than road travel. Local commuters have criticised the shutdown, saying it leaves people in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with few affordable transport options.Over the past 12 months, the Jaffar Express has become a repeated target for insurgent groups, particularly the banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA).In March, BLA militants hijacked the train with 380 passengers on board, triggering a two-day standoff in a mountainous tunnel. Twenty-six people were killed before security forces rescued more than 350 passengers. Authorities said 33 militants also died in the rescue operation.Security officials say insurgent groups are increasingly targeting railways to cripple movement and signal the state’s inability to secure critical transport arteries. Analysts note that the frequency of attacks shows “a collapse of basic security control” across parts of Balochistan’s rail corridor.Political leaders in the province argue that Islamabad has ignored decades of local grievances. Balochistan National Party chief Akhtar Mengal recently warned that the state has “lost control” of the region, saying: “There is not a single inch of Balochistan left where the government can claim authority.”The suspension comes as Pakistan faces one of its most dangerous security challenges in years. Not only has the BLA intensified operations across Balochistan, but attacks linked to Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Islamic State Khorasan (ISK) and cross-border militants have surged.According to the latest Global Terrorism Index, Pakistan recorded a 45% jump in terrorism-related deaths this year. Security officials warn the country is now battling “four fronts at once”—an insurgent network straddling provincial, sectarian and cross-border lines.Diplomatic efforts have yielded little. Peace talks this week between Pakistan and Afghanistan in Istanbul collapsed without agreement, with both sides blaming each other for breakdowns in the ceasefire. Pakistan accuses Kabul of sheltering TTP fighters; the Taliban dismisses the allegations.","Pakistan Railways has halted all operations of the Jaffar Express between Quetta and Peshawar for four days beginning Sunday.

Pakistan’s government has moved ahead with one of the most sweeping structural changes to the country’s constitutional and military setup in decades. The proposed 27th Constitutional Amendment, tabled in the Senate on Saturday after approval by the federal cabinet, rewrites the chain of command of the armed forces and places Field Marshall Asim Munir higher than any military officer before him.The bill restructures Article 243 of the Constitution and creates a powerful new post: Chief of Defence Forces (CDF). According to Dawn, the position will be held by the serving Chief of Army Staff, who will simultaneously become the constitutionally recognised head of Pakistan’s Army, Navy and Air Force. The development formalises General Munir’s elevation as Pakistan’s Field Marshal — a title that the government has already awarded but is now seeking to permanently embed into the Constitution.The changes have ignited intense debate in Islamabad, dividing political parties, lawyers and civil society. Supporters argue that the bill modernises command structures, while critics see it as a dramatic centralisation of military power that weakens civilian oversight.As per report from Dawn, the bill abolishes the position of Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC), the top coordinating office among Pakistan’s military services, from 27 November, when the tenure of the current CJCSC General Sahir Shamshad Mirza ends.Law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar told Parliament that no new appointment will be made, because the Army Chief will take over the role’s functions as Chief of Defence Forces.Under the amendment, the President will appoint the Army, Naval and Air Chiefs on the Prime Minister’s advice, while the CDF will be constitutionally empowered to command all three services.A new position Commander of the National Strategic Command will oversee Pakistan’s nuclear and strategic arsenal. Dawn reported that the commander must be an officer from the Army, appointed by the Prime Minister on the recommendation of the CDF. This further cements the Army Chief’s control over nuclear command authority.The bill also grants unprecedented rights to officers who attain five-star ranks such as Field Marshal, Marshal of the Air Force, or Admiral of the Fleet.Law minister Tarar clarified that Parliament not the Pakistan Prime Minister will have the power to cancel such titles.The amendment does not stop at the military. The second half of the proposal restructures Pakistan’s judicial system.According to Geo News, the bill establishes a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC): a powerful new judicial body that would:Legal experts quoted by Dawn warned that the changes could “dethrone” the Supreme Court as Pakistan’s top judicial authority. One senior counsel said the Supreme Court risked being turned into a “Supreme District Court”, dealing mostly with ordinary appeals, while constitutional matters shift to the FCC.Former additional attorney general Tariq Mehmood Khokhar argued that the amendment tightens executive control over the judiciary and “empowers the FCC by disempowering the Supreme Court”.However, other senior lawyers called it a “forward-looking reform”. They say separating constitutional and appellate functions would reduce delays, depoliticise the Supreme Court and bring Pakistan closer to judicial models in other democracies.The bill has triggered fierce debate in Islamabad. The timing — months after Munir’s elevation and amid delicate coalition negotiations — has intensified public scrutiny.Dawn reported that the proposal surfaced after PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari revealed that PML-N leaders, including Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, requested PPP support for constitutional reforms.Government allies insist the reform merely formalises existing military structures and honours national heroes. Critics say it permanently rebalances power in favour of the Army.If adopted, the 27th Constitutional Amendment will be one of Pakistan’s most consequential defence reforms since the 1980s, dissolving one of the military’s oldest offices, raising the Army Chief to unprecedented constitutional supremacy, and reshaping Pakistan’s highest courts.","Pakistan's government has moved ahead with one of the most sweeping structural changes to the country’s constitutional and military setup in decades.

Donald Trump Stuns Shehbaz Sharif With India-Pak Peace Remark After Gaza Ceasefire Summit In Egypt





ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday once again thanked US President Donald Trump for resolving the India-Pakistan conflict in May.New Delhi has been consistently maintaining that India and Pakistan reached an understanding on May 10 to end the conflict after four days of intense cross-border drone and missile strikes, and no third party was involved in the process.""It was President Trump's bold and decisive leadership that brought about the ceasefire between Pakistan and India, restoring peace in South Asia, averting a major war, and saving millions of people,"" Sharif said while addressing Azerbaijan's Victory Day parade in Baku.Since May 10, when Trump announced on social media that India and Pakistan had agreed to a ""full and immediate ceasefire"" after a ""long night"" of talks mediated by Washington, he has repeated his claim several times that he ""helped settle"" the tensions between the two countries.India has consistently denied any third-party intervention.Pakistan has praised Trump on multiple occasions, claiming that he brokered a ceasefire during the May conflict.India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir in retaliation for the April 22 Pahalgam attack that killed 26 civilians.In his address, Sharif also mentioned Kashmir, saying that Azerbaijan's victory in Karabakh is a beacon of hope for all nations fighting against oppression.The Prime Minister said Pakistan seeks peace, but it will not allow anyone to challenge its sovereignty or undermine territorial integrity.The parade also included contingents of the armed forces from Pakistan and Turkiye who marched alongside Azerbaijani forces.

Deadlock Deepens: Afghanistan Calls Pakistan Irresponsible As Peace Talks Break Down Once Again

(With ANI inputs)





NEW DELHI: A day after peace talks between Afghanistan and Pakistan in Turkey broke down, the Taliban on Saturday accused “elements within the Pakistani military” of pursuing “anti-Afghanistan policies for years. ”“Unfortunately, certain military elements in Pakistan appear to view a stable and strong Afghanistan as contrary to their interests,” Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said in a statement on X. “They have long exploited Afghanistan’s instability, conflicts, and displacement, and now seem intent on creating tensions through fabricated pretexts.”Mujahid also rejected claims that the rise of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) was linked to the Taliban’s return to power in Kabul. “Some groups have falsely accused the Islamic Emirate, suggesting that instability in Pakistan and the TTP’s growth began with our arrival. In reality, both date back to 2002, a result of misguided policies by certain Pakistani military elements who aligned with the US, permitted drone strikes in Waziristan, and turned against their own people,” he wrote.He pointed to a series of Pakistani military campaigns against the TTP — including Operations Al-Mizan, Rah-e-Rast, Sher Dil, Nijat, Koh-e-Safid, and Zarb-e-Azb — that, he said, displaced hundreds of thousands of civilians.“In this so-called war on terror, 80,000–90,000 soldiers and civilians were killed, by Islamabad’s own count, long before the Islamic Emirate’s rise,” Mujahid added.Calling Pakistan’s instability “an internal issue,” Mujahid remarked the Taliban has taken steps to prevent cross-border militancy since taking power. These include mediating dialogue among political and religious figures, relocating refugees from the Durand Line, banning weapons among refugee populations, and issuing fatwas against unauthorized foreign jihad.“The Islamic Emirate welcomes all efforts that allow refugees to return safely,” he stated, reaffirming that Afghanistan would not allow its territory to be used to interfere in another country’s affairs.","The Taliban accused “elements within the Pakistani military’ of pursuing “anti- Afghanistan policies for years” “They have long exploited Afghanistan’s instability, conflicts, and displacement, and now seem intent on creating tensions through fabricated pretexts,” Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125186693,imgsize-78016,width-400,resizemode-4/taliban-accuses-pakistani-military-of-fueling-instability-through-quotmanufactured-pretextsquot.jpg"

Why Pakistani critics are skeptical?







Taking ""lessons"" from tensions with India, Pakistan has moved to fortify the constitutional basis of military command, signaling a push to modernize defense structures and tighten civilian-military coherence. Its law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, on Saturday, tabled the 27th Constitutional Amendment Bill in the upper house, a move aimed at revising Article 243 to formally enshrine the appointments and parallel ranks of the Army, Air, and Naval chiefs.Citing “lessons” from recent India-Pakistan standoffs, Tarar said the nature of modern warfare had changed, requiring constitutional alignment with evolving command realities.“Recent Pakistan-India tensions have taught us many lessons. The nature and strategy of war have completely changed. Appointment procedures and some positions were previously in the Army Act but were not mentioned in the 1973 Constitution. Parallel ranks exist worldwide for Air Chief and Naval Chief,” Tarar said.The move, however, has come under scanner as many believe it could give more power to military than the civilian government in Pakistan.India, on May 7, launched Operation Sindoor against terror sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, killing over 100 terrorists and targeting key JeM and LeT camps. The move, which came in retaliation to Pahalgam terror attack, turned into a major India-Pakistan issue with the latter also launching a military operation against India.By May 10, the two nations announced a ceasefire after Pakistan approached India for truce talks.Ten days after the truce, Pakistani army general Asim Munir was promoted to the rank of field marshal, the principal military advisor to the prime minister and the president of Pakistan on all matters related to national security. Before Munir, former Pakistan President Genral Ayub Khan had self elevated himself to field marshal in 1959.The proposed changes to Article 243 in Pakistan's Constitution, are designed to significantly bolster the authority of the military, specifically, army chief and recently designated field marshal Asim Munir. Here's how:According to an article by Pakistani media outlet Dawn, legal experts in Pakistan remain divided on whether such institutional adjustments truly warrant a constitutional amendment, noting that most operational reforms can be achieved through ordinary legislation rather than altering Article 243.Constitutional experts argued that modernising command structures or creating a Chief of Defence Staff-type position does not require amending Article 243. Such reforms could be introduced through ordinary legislation or defence rules. Altering the Constitution, they warned, risks expanding military autonomy under the guise of structural integration.Another confusion surrounding Article 243 stems from the changes introduced by the 26th Amendment, which extended the army chief’s tenure from three to five years. The current chief, appointed under the old law and later elevated to the ceremonial rank of field marshal, a position not mentioned in the Constitution, has become the focal point of legal ambiguity.Dawn reported that experts remain divided on whether his term automatically extends under the new law or requires a fresh notification, raising questions about the real intent behind the proposed 27th Amendment: to resolve this technical uncertainty or to further cement the military’s influence within Pakistan’s constitutional framework.","Pakistan's law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, on Saturday, tabled the 27th Constitutional Amendment Bill in the upper house.

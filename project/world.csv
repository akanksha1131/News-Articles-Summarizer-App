Nearly six in ten Americans cited it as their primary concern, reflecting heightened awareness around democratic integrity amidst a turbulent political climate.Following democracy, abortion emerged as a key issue for voters, with approximately 5% marking it as a crucial factor. Meanwhile, more than one in ten voters identified the economy as their top priority, highlighting the varied concerns shaping this historic election.This year's race, which sees former President Donald Trump going head-to-head with Democratic candidate vice president Kamala Harris, has been widely regarded as one of the most consequential in recent history.CNN’s exit poll data indicates that roughly three-quarters of the electorate hold a pessimistic view of the country’s current trajectory. Only about a quarter expressed feelings of enthusiasm or satisfaction, while over four in ten reported dissatisfaction and about three in ten described themselves as ""angry"" about the current state of affairs.Despite these sentiments, voter optimism persists, with more than six in ten respondents expressing confidence that America’s best days lie ahead. Roughly one-third, however, voiced concerns that the nation's peak may be behind it. President Joe Biden’s approval ratings, meanwhile, continue to decline, with only four in ten voters endorsing his performance and a clear majority expressing disapproval.The contest between Harris, 60, and Trump, 78, remains razor-thin, with polling in battleground states like Pennsylvania giving Harris a slight edge in recent weeks.","The state of democracy ranks as the most pressing issue for the majority of voters, with nearly six in ten citing it as their primary concern.

Yeah, okay, that's obviously not true literally. It's just a way of saying that when it comes to guns, there ain't no country like US of A - for every 100 Americans, there are 120.5 civilian-owned guns, legal or illegal.US population: 346 mn.US civilian-owned guns: 393 mn.That makes US the only country in the world that has more guns than people. Will some of those guns come into play as results of a toxically divided America's prez polls start rolling out today? That's the fear more thoughtful American commentators have been expressing for months now.If Harris or Trump wins big, that fear's less. If results are close and hotly contested, that fear's more. But even a big victory, say, for Harris, doesn't kill the fear. 'Coz if the Don throws a tanTrump, some Trumpers may decide bullets gotta do the job ballots couldn't.- At least 400 incidents of political violence were reported in US in the first six months of 2024.- That's an 80% jump compared to the whole of 2022.- Trump was just the most famous target.- Unreported elsewhere in the world, local US politicians, election administrators, municipal leaders, school officials and emergency responders have been targeted.- US Department of Homeland Security recently said the threat of political violence is ""high"".- In a 2022 survey, 1 in 3 adult Americans justified political violence to ""protect democracy"".- 1 in 7 agreed there may be a civil war in US in the next few years.- This belief was strongest among MAGA Republicans - 30% of whom are readying for a civil war.- A 2024 survey found 9% of Americans agree with batshit crazy conspiracy theories (example: Satan-worshipping paedophiles run American institutions).- 20% thought they were living in the end of times.Wow, right? But it gets more wow. There are 169 armed private militias in America . Many of these were front and centre when Trump falsely claimed the 2020 election was ""stolen"" from him.And then there's social media. YouTube, X, Facebook, Telegram host lots of groups where a lot of pissed off people with assault rifles get their jollies talking about taking ""the fight"" to the streets. In social media's dark, dank nooks and crannies, politically charged gun-toters recruit and motivate other gun-toters.A report (https://shorturl.at/l8m7P) in The Guardian quoted an expert on political violence, Garen Wintemute: ""There are, on any given day in US, thousands of armed people walking the streets who support the idea of political violence and are willing to engage in it"".He also said: ""What we have (in America) is a uniquely high rate of fatal assaultive violence, and that's because we have a unique level of access to firearms....""That's a lovely way of saying an unlovely thing: there are lots of guns in US, and lots of angry people who reckon they have a political view, mix the two - and take cover.","For every 100 Americans, there are 120.5 civilian-owned guns, legal or illegal.

Vice president Kamala Harris narrowly defeated former president Donald Trump in the US territory of Guam but this poll doesn't count toward the Electoral College.

It had six voters and it only took 12 minutes to count and certify the votes of those six people of this community near the Canadian border. It was a 3-3 tie between Trump and Harris. Dixville Notch's result, though small, marked a significant shift from 2020 when all five votes went to Joe Biden.Dixville Notch, in the White Mountains, started its early voting in 1960. The tradition originated in the nearby town of Hart’s Location, to accommodate rail workers who had to be at work before normal voting hours.The Guardian reported that Dixville does not have any fame to predict the eventual winner.

'Calling' the election: Why media declares winner in US prez race,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/calling-the-election-why-media-declares-winner-in-us-prez-race/articleshow/114997443.cms,"Why's official process long?

A gap to fill

How it's done

The American presidential election is unique in the way its results are announced. Unlike in India, where votes polled in state and central elections are counted on a scheduled day and the official results are put out by the Election Commission (EC), it's the media that announces the winner in the US - a process called 'calling the election'. There are two reasons for it - one, the question of who won the American presidential election isn't officially answered till a few weeks after voting day, and two, there is no central or federal EC in the United States, where elections are held by the states.To fill this void between voting day and the final official announcement, media organisations - news agency the Associated Press being the most prominent among them - step in to collate the results and 'call' a winner.'Calling' the election, mind you, is not an exit poll - it's an entirely different exercise that is rooted not in a survey but actual ballot counting data.Since the US does not have a central polling agency, this job belongs to the states, each of which has its own set of norms and processes to follow. The states and local govts start counting votes after polling concludes on election day - this year, it's Nov 5. This is a complicated exercise in itself because again, unlike in India when voting concludes on the same day it starts, American states can receive mail-in ballots in the days after election day too. Once counting is done, every state takes its own time to certify the results. California, for instance, typically takes a month - till Dec - to tabulate and release the official vote count.Another complexity unique to the American system is the formal process to elect the president through an Electoral College, whose composition is what the votes to elect the president are in essence cast for. It's only in Jan, two months after election day, that the president-elect is declared.""That's a gap in the constitution left by the founders that AP stepped in to fill just two years after our company was founded. It was essential then, as it is today, that Americans have an independent, non-partisan source for the whole picture of the election - most critically of the very vital news of who has won,"" David Scott, AP vice-president, was quoted in an article published by the news agency earlier this month.AP, then a newspaper cooperative formed two years before, made its first call in a presidential election in 1848. Media organisations, on their estimations, declared presidential winners in the years after, and the first formal collaboration took shape in the 1960s. AP and three broadcasters - ABC, CBS and NBC - formed the National Election Pool (NEP) to compile the results.AP eventually broke away from this grouping in 2016 and went on to formed APVoteCast to survey the electorate independently. Broadcasters in NEP switched to data and analysis from polling company Edison Research top read and 'call' the election.While states tabulate their results, AP keeps its own vote count for each state race by deploying reporters and analysts on the ground. This year, AP says it is deploying 4,000 'vote count reporters' at election offices and precincts across the US.The reporters, according to AP, call in with results to 800 'vote entry clerks', who feed the vote counts into AP's standardised format. The same clerks are tasked with entering results from official sources online, such as county and state election websites. They also monitor automated data feeds provided by election officials in some states.There are at least two to three verification checks. The clerks are trained to ask reporters questions if the county results or vote totals look unusual. The system flags any unusual results or statistics to the clerk who is feeding in the vote count. For instance, if a candidate is reported to have received more votes than the county's electorate, the system will alert the clerk about an error, says AP. Vote counts reported by journalists are matched with official online sources to see if they are reported. But this check is limited to states that keep updating their vote counts. AP has a 'decision team' that includes 'race callers' who work closely with 'analysts' on races in the states that decide the presidential election.Before calling a race, this team studies how many votes are left to count. Other than vote totals known to it, the team tries to estimate the overall expected turnout of every county, based on several factors. These can range from voter turnout in previous elections, and early voting trends from the specific area. This team also keeps track of mail-in ballots if that information is released by states or counties.Elucidating on the process, AP says on its blog: ""AP does not make projections or name apparent or likely winners. If our race callers cannot definitively say a candidate has won, we do not engage in speculation... All of this reporting and analysis is aimed at determining the answer to a single question: Can the trailing candidates catch the leader? Only when the answer is an unquestionable 'no' is the race ready to be called.""As a result, 'calling' the election can take time - not as long as the official one- but days. In the 2020 presidential race, AP declared Joe Biden the winner four days after voting. The current contest between vice-president and Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump is expected to be an even tighter one, and therefore, 'calling' may take equally long if not longer.","The American presidential election is unique in the way its results are announced.

SRINAGAR: Pakistan has tested various artillery systems including a replica of the SH-15 and a 155 mm truck-mounted howitzer developed by a Chinese firm along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir, according to officials. This comes as the neighbouring country strengthens defence ties with Gulf and Western European countries, and its long-standing ally Turkiye, the officials said.The movement of the 155 mm guns, produced in collaboration with a Gulf nation under the supervision of a state-owned Chinese defence company , along the LoC was observed recently, they said.The guns -- a variant of SH-15 that is known for its 'shoot and scoot' capability -- can fire a range of munitions, including high-explosive, armour-piercing and smoke rounds, boasting of a maximum range of approximately 30 kilometres and a firing rate of up to six rounds per minute.Among the arsenal being tested is the refurbished M109, which has a firing range of 24 kilometres and can launch six shells in just 40 seconds. Initially acquired from a Western European country, this artillery system is now undergoing trials in its enhanced version, the officials said.Turkiye has contributed to this military enhancement with the deployment of a modern 105 mm artillery piece manufactured by a Turkish defence company, FNSS, they said.This medium-weight tank is equipped with a two-man turret armed with a standard 105 mm rifled gun capable of firing both armour-piercing and high-explosive ammunition.China has also been instrumental in bolstering Pakistan's military capabilities along the LoC, according to the officials.This assistance includes construction of fortified bunkers, provision of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), combat aerial vehicles, and advanced communication systems, the officials said.Early this year, China's North Industries Group Corporation Limited (NORINCO) delivered the second batch of 56 SH-15 155 mm calibre wheeled self-propelled howitzers to the Pakistan army.Chinese support has also extended to the installation of encrypted communication towers and underground fibre optic cables along the LoC, the officials said.","Pakistan has tested various artillery systems including a replica of the SH-15 and a 155 mm truck-mounted howitzer developed by a Chinese firm.

Preventive Detention: Pakistan introduces bill for preventive detention of terror suspects,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-introduces-bill-for-preventive-detention-of-terror-suspects/articleshow/114876705.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: ANI)

ISLAMABAD: In a pivotal legislative move, the Pakistani government introduced a bill on Friday that seeks to authorise military and civil armed forces to detain individuals charged with terrorism for up to three months under a system of "" preventive detention .""This bill, which amends the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) of 1997, was tabled by law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar in a session of the National Assembly that saw limited attendance and was quickly referred to the relevant committee for further consideration, Dawn reported.The proposed legislation includes measures for forming Joint Investigation Teams (JITs) made up of various law enforcement and intelligence agency members to conduct inquiries into terrorism-related cases.These amendments to Clause 11EEEE of the ATA were initially enacted following the tragic Army Public School attack in Peshawar but lapsed a decade ago due to a sunset clause.As outlined in the bill's Statement of Objects and Reasons, the ""erstwhile amendments of Section 11EEEE of the Act are required to be re-inserted to empower the government, armed forces and civil armed forces with the necessary authority to detain individuals who pose a significant threat to national security.""The new provisions would allow preventive detention based on credible information or reasonable suspicion, enabling authorities to intervene before potential terrorist acts can be carried out, reported Dawn.Furthermore, the bill aims to strengthen the legal framework for law enforcement agencies to conduct more effective operations against terrorism. It will facilitate the formation of JITs to conduct thorough inquiries and gather actionable intelligence.According to the bill, Section 11EEEE was amended in 2014 to allow the government and authorised military and civil forces to detain individuals suspected of terrorism-related activities, but its validity expired in 2016 due to a sunset clause.The proposed amendment states: ""The government or, where the provisions of Section 4 have been invoked, the armed forces or civil armed forces, as the case may be, subject to the specific or general order of the government in this regard, for a period not exceeding three months and after recording reasons thereof, issue order for the preventive detention of any person who has been concerned in any offence under this Act relating to the security or defence of Pakistan or any part thereof, or public order relating to target killing, kidnapping for ransom, and extortion, bhatta or the maintenance of supplies or services, or against whom a reasonable complaint has been made or credible information has been received, or a reasonable suspicion exists of his having been so concerned, for purpose of inquiry.""Additionally, the amendment specifies that the detention of such persons, including any extensions beyond three months, will adhere to Article 10 of the Constitution. A new provision mandates that if an armed forces-issued detention order is made, the inquiry will involve a JIT, including a police officer of at least superintendent rank and members from various intelligence agencies.These new provisions will remain valid for two years following the commencement of the ATA (Amendment) Act, 2024.In related parliamentary discussions, speaker Ayaz Sadiq warned he would summon meetings of seven standing committees to elect chairpersons if the opposition Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party does not provide nominations by next week. The issue was raised after criticism of government ministers' absence during a question hour, Dawn reported.Law minister Tarar also addressed concerns regarding the placement of several opposition lawmakers on the Exit Control List (ECL), indicating that names are added due to absconding in criminal cases. He encouraged opposition members to formally submit requests for review, stating that 65 to 70 per cent of ECL removal requests are typically accepted.The National Assembly is scheduled to reconvene on Monday evening.","Pakistani government introduces bill to authorise military and civil armed forces to detain individuals charged with terrorism for up to three months.

ISLAMABAD: At least seven people, including five schoolchildren and a police constable, were killed and more than 20 others injured in a roadside bomb explosion in Mastung district of Pakistan ’s southwestern Balochistan province on Friday.State-run PTV news quoted Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif as saying that the explosion had occurred at a “girls’ high school”, while another post by the outlet said the incident occurred “near girls’ high school chowk”.Naeem Bazai, commissioner for Kalat division, said the attack had occurred near Mastung’s civil hospital, a few metres from the girls’ school.Officials said the blast resulted from an improvised explosive device (IED) fitted inside a motorcycle parked outside a mechanic’s shop. “The IED exploded when a police mobile and a school van were crossing the blast site,” said Mastung district deputy commissioner Baz Muhammad Marri.“Seven people, including a cop and five minor children, were killed and 22 others injured in the explosion,” Marri told the media. “We are ascertaining who was actually targeted because a police mobile and a school van were both passing by the area,” he added.Sarfaraz Bugti, Balochistan’s chief minister, condemned the attack and expressed grief over the loss of lives. “The terrorists have targeted innocent children. We will hold accountable, the perpetrators of the blast,” he said in a statement.Waseem Baig, a spokesman for the Balochistan health department, said 11 injured, including two children, had been shifted to a trauma centre in Quetta, the provincial capital. “Three injured are in critical condition,” he added.Balochistan, Pakistan’s largest province by area, has been facing grave security conditions since the country launched a military offensive there in 2006, vowing to wipe out so-called traitors and terrorists.At least 20 labourers were killed in a rocket attack in October on coal mines in the province’s Duki district.

(Reuters)

DHAKA: Around 200 Bangladeshis abducted by security forces during toppled premier Sheikh Hasina's rule are still missing, a commission tasked with investigating enforced disappearances said Tuesday.Hasina, 77, fled by helicopter to neighbouring India in August as a student-led uprising saw protesters flood streets of the capital Dhaka, bringing a dramatic end to her iron-fisted tenure.Her government was accused of widespread human rights abuses, including the extrajudicial killing of hundreds of political opponents and the unlawful abduction and disappearance of hundreds more.A commission of inquiry set up by the caretaker government now running the country said that five people had been released from secret detention centres after Hasina's ouster, but that many more were still unaccounted for.""There is no trace of at least 200 people. We have been working to locate them,"" commission member Noor Khan said.The commission said it had identified at least eight secret detention centres in Dhaka and its outskirts, some with cells as small as three by four feet (90 by 120 centimetres).It said the walls of these cells had engravings that appeared to show their occupants having kept tally of the number of days they had been detained.One commissioner said there had been efforts by unnamed law enforcement agencies to erase evidence of these secret detention centres after Hasina's overthrow.Commissioners said most disappearance cases brought to its attention blamed the elite Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) police unit.The RAB was sanctioned by Washington in 2021 alongside seven of its senior officers in response to reports of its culpability in some of the worst rights abuses committed during Hasina's rule.Commission chair Moyeenul Islam Chowdhury said that institutional breakdowns in the government and judiciary had also allowed a climate of impunity to flourish under Hasina.""They used the law enforcement agency not in the public interest, but for their own agenda and political interest,"" he said.The commission was established by the interim government of Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus as part of its efforts to implement far-reaching democratic reforms.Yunus has previously said he inherited a ""completely broken down"" system of public administration that needed a comprehensive overhaul to prevent a future return to autocracy.","Hasina, 77, fled by helicopter to neighbouring India in August as a student-led uprising saw protesters flood streets of the capital Dhaka.

'Living Buddhas'

MANDALAY: Sculptor Aung Naing Lin has spent decades carving Buddha statues to help guide Myanmar's faithful -- but getting the marble he needs from rebel-held quarries in the midst of civil war is now a perilous task.Buddhist-majority Myanmar has been mired in bloody conflict since the military toppled the government of Aung San Suu Kyi in 2021, terminating a 10-year experiment with democracy and sparking a widespread armed uprising.In recent months, opponents of the military have advanced with rocket and drone attacks on Mandalay -- the country's second-biggest city, with a population of 1.5 million.The rebels have also seized the hillside quarries that have for generations provided the marble that adorns Mandalay's palaces and monasteries, as well as the shrines in ordinary homes.Now, moving the precious stone and roughly carved statues by truck across the divide of the civil war, from rebel to junta-held territory, is expensive, difficult and dangerous.""The situation around the Madaya township (where the quarries are located) is not very good,"" Aung Naing Lin told AFP at his noisy workshop in Mandalay, his face and hair speckled with white dust.""It is not easy to go, and we cannot bring the stones back.""Surrounded by dozens of blank-faced Buddha statues waiting to be given eyes, ears and lips, Min Min Soe agreed.""Sales are not that bad, but the challenge is bringing the statues here,"" he said.""We can sell only the statues we have here and we cannot bring new raw statues in.""The owner of another workshop, who did not want to be named, said associates of his were recently arrested when taking a shipment of marble from rebel-held Madaya.""They were detained by the local military column and were asked how they brought the stones out from the village as that area was controlled by the PDF,"" they said.""People's Defence Forces"" are units made up of former students, farmers and workers who have left their lives behind to take up arms and oppose the junta's coup.There are dozens of PDFs across the country, and they have dragged the junta into a bloody stalemate.The junta has designated them as ""terrorists"", and contact with them can bring years in prison.""Later, they released the people who had been detained and gave the stones back,"" the workshop owner said.""It's like a warning to all. We dare not to bring stones from the village under this situation.""The quarries of Madaya have long been interwoven with the cultural and religious history of Myanmar.In the 1860s, following two disastrous wars with the British, then-king Mindon commissioned craftsmen in Mandalay to transfer Buddhist scriptures from palm leaf manuscripts onto 720 blocks of solid marble to ensure they survived any further destruction.The stone also resonates with the military that has ruled Myanmar for much of its history since independence from Britain in 1948.In 2020, it sanctioned the building of a 25-metre (82-foot) high statue of the Buddha made from Madaya marble to adorn its custom-built capital Naypyidaw.Junta chief Min Aung Hlaing declared the statue finished last year and a visit has since become a stock feature of the itineraries of the few foreign delegations that visit the isolated junta.While the fighting continues north of Mandalay, Min Min Soe and others work to put the finishing touches on the dozens of roughly hewn statues.Their forefathers used chisels, but nowadays, craftsmen use drills to etch everything from Buddha's face, the folds in his robe, fingernails and the lotus flower he sits on.The laborious final stages of smoothing the rough edges are done by women using sandpaper, said Min Min Soe.""Women are better at this as they are more patient,"" he said.A finished statue around 25 centimetres (10 inches) high fetches between 100,000 - 200,000 Myanmar kyat ($50-$100 at the official exchange rate), he said.Outside one of the workshops on the busy street, workers packed a sitting Buddha statue into a wooden protective frame before shipping it off to a customer.Min Min Soe says looking after the dozens of his creations still in stock helps him find his own peace amid rumours of an attack on Mandalay.He considers them ""living Buddhas"".""I clean the statues at 4 am every day... This is not only for my business but also to gain merit,"" he said.""I want them to be clean and good-looking no matter if they are sold or not.""",Buddhist-majority Myanmar has been mired in bloody conflict since the military toppled the government of Aung San Suu Kyi in 2021.

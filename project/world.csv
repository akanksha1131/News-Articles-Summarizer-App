'Academic freedom': Houston University defends its 'Lived Hindu Religion' course amidst controversy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/academic-freedom-houston-university-defends-its-lived-hindu-religion-course-amidst-controversy/articleshow/119685123.cms,"Houston University (Image Credit: X/@UHouston)

What is the controversy all about?



The University of Houston (UH) defended its content of a course on the Hindu religion, and said that the course is grounded in the academic discipline of religious studies , which uses specific terminology, such as ""fundamentalism"".The university further stated that studying fundamentalism is not an act of judgment or bias but a way to understand how religions evolve.This statement came in response to a student complaint about a course titled ""Lived Hindu Religion.""""The University of Houston (UH) values academic freedom , which includes allowing faculty to explore complex and sometimes challenging topics in their teaching. While UH does not typically review individual lectures, the university maintains oversight of the curriculum to ensure it meets established academic and pedagogical standards,"" the university said in a statement."" The course is grounded in the academic discipline of religious studies, which uses specific terminology -- such as 'fundamentalism' --as analytical tools to understand religious movements across traditions, including those rooted in Christianity, Islam, Buddhism and Hinduism. These academic terms can carry different meanings from how they are used in public or political discourse, which sometimes leads to misunderstandings,"" it added.The University of Houston's Lived Hindu Religion course , which is offered to students online, had sparked the controversy. The video lectures are delivered by Professor Aaron Michael Ullrey weekly.In a statement, the university explained that in religious studies, fundamentalism refers to a movement that claims to preserve the 'true' or original version of a religion, asserting a strict, ahistorical, literal interpretation of scripture, dogmas or ideologies, often in reaction to modern changes.It also said that studying fundamentalism is not an act of judgment or bias but a way to understand how religions evolve and identify through discourse analysis.""The course applies academic frameworks to analyze how Hinduism, the religion of those who revere Hindu gods, like other world religions, has developed in historical, social and political contexts. Professors are encouraged to connect course content to current events when appropriate, as long as it is done in a balanced way that improves understanding of course content. For example, discussing the political rise of Hindu nationalism in India is part of understanding how religion and religious discourse function in the modern world, but it is not a critique of Hinduism as a whole,"" the university added.The controversy is around the University of Houston’s ‘Lived Hindu Religion’ course, which is conducted online.According to Hindu on Campus, a student-led platform advocating for diaspora Hindus against Hinduphobia, on X also criticised the course.In a statement on X, the group said, “A Hindu student at @UHouston is reported to be in a class wherein the Professor is delegitimizing Hindu identity, linking it to politics and religious extremism. >90% of Muslims and other minority groups see themselves as proud to be Indian (Source: Pew Research Center) What is being taught at our universities?!.”","The University of Houston (UH) defended its content of a course on the Hindu religion, and said that the course is grounded in the academic discipline of religious studies.

A powerful earthquake struck Myanmar and neighboring Thailand on Friday, destroying buildings, a bridge, and a dam. At least 694 people were killed in Myanmar, where photos and videos from two cities showed widespread damage. In Thailand, at least eight people died in the capital, where a high-rise building under construction collapsed.The earthquake had a magnitude of 7.7, with its epicenter near Mandalay , Myanmar’s second-largest city. A strong aftershock of 6.4 magnitude followed. The full extent of casualties and destruction was not immediately clear, especially in Myanmar, one of the world’s poorest countries, where information is tightly controlled and the country is engaged in a civil war.Myanmar’s Junta said on Saturday that at least 694 people had been killed and 1,670 others injured. “The death toll and injuries are expected to rise,” the Junta had said on Friday.Photos from the capital, Naypyidaw, showed several government housing buildings destroyed, with rescue workers pulling victims from the debris. Myanmar’s government reported a high demand for blood donations in the worst-affected areas. Images showed cracked and damaged roads in Mandalay, a collapsed bridge, and damage to a dam, raising concerns about how rescue workers would be able to reach certain areas. Myanmar is already facing a humanitarian crisis, making response efforts more challenging.In Bangkok, a 33-story building under construction collapsed near the Chatuchak market. A crane was on top of the structure when it crumpled into a cloud of dust. A video posted on social media showed people screaming and running as the building fell. The sound of sirens filled central Bangkok, and heavy traffic led to gridlocked streets. The elevated rapid transit system and the subway were shut down.While there was no widespread destruction, the shaking brought some dramatic images of rooftop swimming pools sloshing their contents down the side of many of the city's towering apartment blocks and hotels.The area where the earthquake occurred is seismically active, but earthquakes of this size are not common. It is rare for tremors to be felt in Bangkok, which sits on a river delta and has a moderate earthquake risk.In Bangkok, at least three people were killed in the collapse, and 90 others were missing, according to Defense Minister Phumtham Wechayachai. He did not provide further details on the rescue operations, but first responders reported rescuing seven people from the site.At least two of the dead were construction workers who were struck by falling debris, according to rescue worker Songwut Wangpon. The building was being constructed by the China Railway Construction Corporation for Thailand’s government auditor general.Rescue teams were searching through the debris of collapsed buildings on Saturday, trying to find survivors.According to US geologists, it was the strongest earthquake to hit Myanmar in over a century.In the Thai capital, rescuers worked overnight to locate workers trapped under the remains of a 30-story building under construction. The structure collapsed within seconds, leaving behind a heap of rubble and twisted metal due to the force of the quake.Authorities in Bangkok declared the city a disaster area to allow a coordinated response. The metropolitan area has a population of more than 17 million, with many people living in high-rise apartments.India will send more than 15 tonnes of relief materials to Myanmar after a series of strong earthquakes, news agency PTI reported.The relief supplies will be transported on an Indian Air Force (IAF) C-130J aircraft from Air Force Station Hindon.The package includes tents, sleeping bags, blankets, ready-to-eat meals, water purifiers, hygiene kits, solar lamps, generator sets, and essential medicines such as paracetamol, antibiotics, syringes, gloves, and bandages.The US Geological Survey and Germany’s GFZ geosciences center reported that the earthquake was at a depth of 10 kilometers (6.2 miles), according to preliminary findings. Shallower earthquakes tend to cause more destruction.In Mandalay, multiple buildings were damaged, including the Ma Soe Yane monastery, one of the city’s largest, and the former royal palace. A video posted online showed monks in the street filming the monastery just before it collapsed. It was not immediately known if anyone was harmed.In the Sagaing region, southwest of Mandalay, a 90-year-old bridge collapsed. Some sections of the highway linking Mandalay and Myanmar’s largest city, Yangon, were also damaged.Myanmar’s military took power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021. The country is now in a civil war involving long-established armed groups and newly formed pro-democracy forces.Government forces have lost control of many areas in Myanmar, making them difficult or impossible for aid groups to access. The United Nations estimates that more than 3 million people have been displaced due to the fighting, and nearly 20 million people are in need of assistance.The Red Cross reported that downed power lines made it more difficult for their teams to reach some affected locations.Myanmar’s government declared a state of emergency in six regions and states, including Naypyidaw and Mandalay. It was unclear what the declaration would mean since the entire country has been under a state of emergency since 2021.To the northeast, in China, the earthquake was felt in Yunnan and Sichuan provinces. The city of Ruili, which is on the border with Myanmar, experienced damage to houses, and some people were injured, according to Chinese media reports.Videos that one media outlet said came from Ruili showed debris covering a street and a person being transported on a stretcher to an ambulance.The shaking in Mangshi, a city about 100 kilometers (60 miles) northeast of Ruili, was so strong that people could not stand, a resident told The Paper, an online news outlet.","Myanmar's Junta said on Saturday that at least 694 people had been killed and 1,670 others injured.

Why Myanmar is one of the most earthquake-vulnerable countries



Seismic setting and tectonic complexity

Andaman Megathrust Zone : Situated to the west, this active subduction zone marks the point where the India Plate is steadily forced beneath the Burma Plate at a rate of 2–3.5 cm per year. Over time, this tectonic process has triggered powerful earthquakes and tsunamis, including the one resulting from the 2004 Sumatra Earthquake.

: Situated to the west, this active subduction zone marks the point where the India Plate is steadily forced beneath the Burma Plate at a rate of 2–3.5 cm per year. Over time, this tectonic process has triggered powerful earthquakes and tsunamis, including the one resulting from the 2004 Sumatra Earthquake. Sagaing Fault Zone: Running through central Myanmar, this major transform fault is responsible for many of the country’s most destructive quakes. It produces shallow-focus earthquakes, which can be particularly damaging in densely populated areas.

NEW DELHI: A powerful 7.7-magnitude earthquake struck near Mandalay, Myanmar, early Friday, sending tremors as far as Bangkok, approximately 800 miles (1,300 kilometers) away. The quake caused extensive damage in two major cities, with images from the capital, Naypyidaw, showing rescue crews working to pull victims from the rubble of collapsed buildings. Authorities in Bangkok reported fatalities at three construction sites, including a high-rise that collapsed.Experts say the earthquake occurred along the Sagaing Fault , a major seismic zone in Myanmar, and was relatively shallow, resulting in intense ground shaking. The US Geological Survey (USGS) estimates that nearly 800,000 people were in the zone of the strongest shaking, with preliminary projections suggesting a potential death toll exceeding 1,000, possibly much higher.The Earth's crust is broken into several large pieces known as tectonic plates , which fit together like a jigsaw puzzle.This formation is “mostly stable, but along the edges they are moving,” Columbia University geophysicist Michael Steckler said.Pressure builds up when these plates get stuck while sliding past each other. Over decades or centuries, stress accumulates until the plates suddenly shift, releasing energy that triggers an earthquake, Steckler explained.Earthquakes commonly occur along the boundaries of tectonic plates, but their impacts can extend far beyond the fault lines. While undersea earthquakes may go unnoticed, those occurring near populated areas often lead to widespread destruction, primarily from collapsed buildings.Also read: Myanmar-Thailand earthquake: Videos capture collapsing buildings, cracked roads, and mass panic Scientists can determine where earthquakes are likely to occur but cannot predict their exact timing, USGS seismologist Will Yeck said.However, after a significant earthquake, researchers can anticipate aftershocks—smaller tremors caused by stress changes in the Earth’s crust following the main shock.Given the scale of the Myanmar earthquake, “you will probably see aftershocks for the next several months,” Steckler said.Regions with active fault lines, such as California and Japan, often enforce strict building codes to minimize earthquake damage . However, that is not always the case in other parts of the world.“If you feel shaking, the guidance depends on where you are in the world,” Yeck said.In many places, including the US, safety experts recommend dropping to the ground, covering your head by taking shelter under a sturdy object like a desk, and holding on. Avoid standing near windows or using elevators during an earthquake.If outside, move to an open area away from buildings and trees that could collapse.Depending on the earthquake’s location, additional hazards such as landslides, fires, or tsunamis may follow, Yeck added.Nestled in Southeast Asia, Myanmar sits atop a complex network of geological fault lines, making it one of the most earthquake-prone nations in the region. Positioned along one of the world's most seismically active belts, the country has a long history of devastating earthquakes caused by shifting tectonic plates. From the deep-seated movements of the Andaman Megathrust to the constant activity along the Sagaing Fault, these underground forces have repeatedly reshaped Myanmar’s landscape. Myanmar’s susceptibility to earthquakes is largely due to its location along the Alpide Belt, a region known for intense seismic activity.Recent studies in paleoseismology and tectonic geodesy have identified active segments of the Sagaing, Kyaukkyan, and Kabaw faults, reinforcing the persistent risk of sudden, high-magnitude tremors.","A 7.7-magnitude earthquake struck near Mandalay, Myanmar, early Friday, sending tremors as far as Bangkok.

'Suspicious vehicles': Israeli military admits to shooting at ambulances in Gaza,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/suspicious-vehicles-israeli-military-admits-to-shooting-at-ambulances-in-gaza/articleshow/119685106.cms,"File photo

Israeli military on Saturday admitted to shooting at ambulances in Gaza Strip citing them as ""suspicious vehicles."" Hamas condemned the attack as a ""war crime"" that resulted in at least one fatality.""A few minutes afterward, additional vehicles advanced suspiciously toward the troops... The troops responded by firing toward the suspicious vehicles, eliminating a number of Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists,"" the Israeli military said.The military said that an initial inquiry revealed some of the suspected vehicles were ambulances and fire trucks. It also condemned the ""repeated use"" of ambulances by ""terrorist organizations in the Gaza Strip for terrorist purposes.""A day after the incident, Gaza's civil defense agency reported losing contact with a team of six rescuers from Tal al-Sultan who had been dispatched to respond to casualties.

Skywatchers and astronomy enthusiasts are in for a spectacular celestial event as a partial solar eclipse is set to occur on March 29, 2025. This breathtaking phenomenon will follow a total lunar eclipse that took place just weeks earlier, adding to the excitement for stargazers. The eclipse will be particularly visible across parts of the northeastern United States and Canada, where observers will witness the moon partially obscuring the sun at sunrise, creating a stunning crescent-like effect.Unlike a total solar eclipse, where the moon completely blocks the sun, a partial eclipse leaves a portion of the sun visible, offering a unique viewing experience. This event will be visible to over 800 million people worldwide, making it one of the most widely observed astronomical occurrences of 2025. With proper precautions and the right viewing locations, this solar eclipse promises to be a memorable spectacle.According to Space.com, the March 29, 2025, solar eclipse will occur between 4:50 a.m. and 8:43 a.m. Eastern Time (ET). The event will be best visible at sunrise across several states in the northeastern U.S. and parts of Canada.The following states will have some of the best views of the partial solar eclipse, as reported by USA Today:Additionally, the eclipse will be visible across Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Vermont, West Virginia, and Washington, D.C. However, visibility will depend on local weather conditions, so clear skies will be essential for an optimal viewing experience.A partial solar eclipse occurs when the moon moves between the Earth and the sun, but its alignment is not perfect, causing only a portion of the sun to be obscured. The extent to which the sun is covered depends on the observer's location. During this event, the moon will appear to take a ""bite"" out of the sun, producing a crescent-like visual effect.Although partial eclipses do not create the dramatic darkness of a total eclipse, they remain fascinating astronomical events. Observers will notice shadows appearing sharper, temperature drops, and changes in animal behavior during the peak of the eclipse.The March 29, 2025, eclipse is part of a series of solar eclipses that occur as the Earth, moon, and sun align at specific intervals. The moon’s orbital tilt prevents solar eclipses from occurring every month, making them relatively rare events.During a partial solar eclipse, the sun is never fully covered, and the extent of the obscuration depends on the observer's position on Earth. The phenomenon is a reminder of the intricate mechanics of celestial bodies and their predictable yet mesmerizing movements.At sunrise, when the eclipse reaches its peak in North America, the sun will appear as a thin crescent, giving the impression that a large portion of it has been ""bitten off."" As the moon moves along its orbit, the sun will gradually regain its full shape, marking the end of the event.Unlike lunar eclipses, which are safe to view with the naked eye, solar eclipses require special protective measures. Looking directly at the sun, even during a partial eclipse, can cause severe retinal damage, often referred to as ""eclipse blindness.""To safely observe the eclipse, experts recommend using:Standard sunglasses are not sufficient for protection and should not be used. Organizations such as NASA and the American Astronomical Society provide guidelines on purchasing certified eclipse glasses to ensure safe viewing.The partial solar eclipse will occur on March 29, 2025, between 4:50 a.m. and 8:43 a.m. Eastern Time (ET). It will be best visible at sunrise across the northeastern United States and parts of Canada. Some of the key locations for optimal viewing include New York, Massachusetts, Maine, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Virginia, among others.A partial solar eclipse occurs when the moon moves between the Earth and the sun but does not fully cover it. This results in a portion of the sun remaining visible, creating a crescent-like effect. In contrast, a total solar eclipse occurs when the moon completely obscures the sun, briefly turning day into night.Viewing a solar eclipse requires proper eye protection. Experts recommend using eclipse glasses that meet ISO 12312-2 safety standards, solar viewing filters, or indirect viewing methods such as pinhole projectors. Standard sunglasses are not safe for eclipse viewing, as they do not provide adequate protection against harmful UV rays.Solar eclipses are rare because the moon’s orbit is tilted relative to the Earth's orbit around the sun. This means that the moon, Earth, and sun do not always align perfectly. Eclipses only occur when their orbits intersect at specific points, leading to either partial or total solar eclipses.Yes, during the peak of the eclipse, observers may notice subtle environmental changes such as a slight drop in temperature, sharper shadows, and altered animal behavior. These effects occur because the reduced sunlight affects both the atmosphere and the natural world.","A partial solar eclipse is set to occur on March 29, 2025.

Israeli authorities are angry over the Signal chat leak as it contained sensitive intelligence that Israel had shared with the US from a human source in Yemen, CBS News reported.The Atlantic editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, had shared the chat with senior Trump administration officials where he was ""accidentally"" added.While not affecting the airstrike's success due to the publication's discretion, but still The Atlantic did expose a human source who provided intelligence to Israel, which was subsequently shared with the US for targeting purposes, according to a senior American intelligence official and someone familiar with Israel's concerns.The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday about Israeli complaints to US officials regarding Mike Waltz, President Trump's national security adviser, who created the group chat and inadvertently included Goldberg. The group discussed potential strikes against Iranian-backed Houthi militants in Yemen, who have launched multiple missiles towards Israel and attacked shipping in the Red Sea.On March 15, Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth sent messages to the principals committee group chat, comprising the highest-ranking National Security Council members, including Cabinet officials and other senior US representatives.According to screenshots of the thread thatpublished, Hegseth wrote:A senior American intelligence official explained to CBS News that ""Trigger Based"" indicates an operation dependent on specific conditions - essentially a decision to proceed with an airstrike based on target confirmation.That day, Navy F/A-18F Super Hornets departed from the aircraft carrier Harry S. Truman in the Red Sea, whilst MQ-9 Reaper drones launched from Middle Eastern bases. US Central Command announced commencing operations with ""precision strikes against Iran-backed Houthi targets across Yemen to restore freedom of navigation.""Before the strike decision, Hegseth expressed support for the action to restore navigation freedom and re-establish deterrence, which he noted had diminished under the Biden administration.After US airstrikes began, Waltz informed Vice President JD Vance via the chat that the building had collapsed and U.S. forces had ""multiple positive ID"" of their intended Houthi targets.Waltz stated: ""The first target — their top missile guy — we had positive ID of him walking into his girlfriend's building and it's now collapsed,"" as reported by The Atlantic.Despite criticism over the Signal chat, senior Trump administration officials maintain the information wasn't classified and no sources or methods were compromised.Waltz posted on X: ""No locations. No sources & methods. No WAR PLANS.

A US federal judge on Friday halted the Trump administration 's attempt to dismantle the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau , marking the latest legal setback in the White House's swift push to reshape the federal government.Judge Amy Berman Jackson issued a preliminary injunction to ensure the agency's continuation until she delivers a final verdict on a lawsuit aiming to protect the agency. She stated that judicial action was necessary and essential to prevent the agency's closure.The judge determined that without judicial intervention, the Trump administration would swiftly shut down the agency established by Congress following the 2008 financial crisis, AP news agency reported.Deepak Gupta, attorney representing CFPB workers, welcomed the ruling, stating it halts the unprecedented attempt to dismantle the CFPB and maintains its crucial consumer protection work. ""We're heartened by the decision and look forward to continuing to press our case in court,"" he said in a statement.A March 10 hearing revealed the internal disruption at the agency after staff were instructed to cease work. Adam Martinez, the chief operating officer, described the agency entering ""wind-down mode"" after Trump dismissed Rohit Chopra on February 1.The interim director appointed by Trump halted all operations, terminated £100 million in contracts and dismissed 70 staff members. Martinez noted that current leadership adopted a more systematic approach compared to their initial actions when Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency representatives arrived.The CFPB oversees consumer protection against financial fraud and deceptive practices, handling complaints and monitoring banks to safeguard student loan borrowers.After dismissing the agency's director last month, US President Donald Trump told reporters that the agency should be abolished. On the same day DOGE workers gained access to the CFPB headquarters, Musk posted ""CFPB RIP"" on his social media platform, X.However, once the lawsuit was underway, agency officials walked back some of their earlier positions, asserting in court that they had no intention of dismantling the agency. They also instructed staff to resume certain operations, leading to confusion among employees.""If the defendants are not restrained, they will dismantle the agency before the court has the chance to determine whether the law allows them to do so. As the defendants' own witness warned, the damage will be irreversible,"" Judge Berman Jackson wrote, as per Reuters.In a strongly worded ruling, she dismissed key evidence presented by justice department lawyers, describing some claims as ""a charade for the court's benefit.""","Judge Amy Berman Jackson issued a preliminary injunction to ensure the agency's continuation until she delivers a final verdict on a lawsuit aiming to protect the agency. The judge determined that without judicial intervention, the Trump administration would shut down the agency established by Congress following the 2008 financial crisis.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119682167,imgsize-24950,width-400,resizemode-4/119682167.jpg"
Why did Donald Trump pull Elise Stefanik's UN nomination? Here's the answer,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/why-did-donald-trump-pull-elise-stefaniks-un-nomination-heres-the-answer/articleshow/119682006.cms,"Stefanik’s appointment to UN

Fundraising concerns in Florida

Republican frustrations over the decision

Shrinking majority

US President Donald Trump revealed the reason for withdrawing Representative Elise Stefanik ’s nomination as the next US ambassador to the United Nations.He took this decision only to safeguard the Republican majority in the House. Trump acknowledged his party's risky position in Congress, admitting he “didn’t even want to take the chance” of losing Stefanik’s seat in New York’s 21st Congressional district, along with another vacancy in Florida.“We have a few elections going on,” he said—just days after Stefanik had expressed excitement about the UN role on Fox News.A senior White House official stressed the urgency of the decision, telling the New York Post, “Debt ceiling and reconciliation votes are going to be tough already due to Democrats and slim margins, and we can’t make it tougher on ourselves.” Debt ceiling and reconciliation votes are going to be tough already due to Democrats and slim margins, and we can’t make it tougher on ourselves. They added that Stefanik’s seat “would have been vacant for most of the year,” making it a risky move for the GOP.“The American people need and deserve every Republican vote in the House to enact President Trump’s agenda,” the official continued. “We don’t have time to waste.”The Republican-controlled House faces critical votes on major issues, including Trump’s proposed legislation on border security, energy, and taxation—bills that could pass with a simple majority.Government spending measures, however, will likely face strong opposition from Democrats and could also test the unity of fiscal conservatives within the Republican ranks.Stefanik, 40, was selected for the UN post in November and had even tweeted on Monday about her excitement to join Trump’s administration. However, speaking to Hannity on Thursday night, she insisted she had no regrets about the nomination being withdrawn.“This is about stepping up as a team,” she said. “I am doing that as a leader to ensure that we can take hold of this mandate and deliver these historic results.”Trump confirmed on Friday that he pulled her appointment due to the looming special election in her district, as well as the vacancy left by former Florida representative Mike Waltz, who was recently appointed as Trump’s national security adviser.New York Governor Kathy Hochul had also faced hurdles in scheduling a special election for Stefanik’s seat, after clashing with Trump over congestion pricing.Despite his decision, Trump reaffirmed Stefanik’s strong standing in her district, stating, “She’s popular in her district and can’t be beaten.” However, he admitted he was less confident about securing a solid Republican replacement.Another key factor in Trump’s decision was the race to replace Waltz in Florida. Republican candidate Randy Fine is struggling to keep up with Democrat Josh Weil in fundraising, with Weil reportedly securing nearly $9 million in campaign donations compared to Fine’s $987,459, according to Federal Election Commission filings.“You never know what happens in a case like that,” Trump said, expressing concerns over the competitiveness of the race.Trump also acknowledged that Stefanik had done him “a big favour” by remaining in Congress, and house speaker Mike Johnson has promised her a leadership position within the party. However, it remains unclear what that role will be.While some GOP sources supported Trump’s caution, others were left disappointed by the move, arguing that Stefanik was highly qualified and Republicans had a strong chance of retaining her seat.“It plays into the Dem narrative that you’d lose these seats,” one Republican insider said. “It makes everyone look stupid.”Another insider said, “Pulling Stefanik doesn’t make sense.”Trump has yet to announce who will now be nominated for the UN role. Meanwhile, the contests for Waltz’s and former representative Matt Gaetz’s seats in Florida will take place on Tuesday. Gaetz had resigned from Congress after briefly being considered for US attorney general.House speaker Mike Johnson had previously cautioned Trump about the party’s fragile position in the House. At an event with Americans for Prosperity, Johnson recalled a conversation during the White House transition in which he urged Trump to reconsider pulling too many House Republicans into his administration.“Trump began to call the herd,” Johnson said. “So he took a few, and I called him, and I’m like, ‘Mr President, you cannot take any more.’”Johnson said Trump responded, “Oh, Mike, did I do that?”With a slim 218-213 majority over Democrats, the GOP faces an uphill battle in maintaining control of the House.","US President Donald Trump has withdrawn Representative Elise Stefanik’s nomination as the next US ambassador to the United Nations. He said he did so to safeguard the Republican majority in the House. Stefanik's seat would have been vacant for most of the year, making it a risky move for the GOP. The Republican- controlled House faces critical votes on major issues.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119681968,imgsize-1426906,width-400,resizemode-4/119681968.jpg"

Hundreds of international students wake up to an email asking them to self deport for campus activism,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hundreds-of-international-students-are-waking-up-to-an-email-asking-them-to-self-deport-for-campus-activism-or-even-sharing-posts-on-social-media/articleshow/119679695.cms,"The email sent to the students reads:

Views of an immigration attorney:

Jath Shao , founder of an immigration law firm, spoke extensively with TOI on this emerging issue.

“F-1 and J-1 students are usually admitted D/S, meaning for the duration of their status. There’s a slight distinction between overstay and unlawful presence Historically, someone admitted D/S has not accrued unlawful presence for the purpose of 3 or 10 year bars unless USCIS makes a formal finding that they are unlawfully present. This is important because if you're formally unlawfully present for more than 180 days or 365 days, it can trigger a 3 or 10 year bar. However, with overstay, it's more in a gray area - where the consular officer has more discretion whether to hold that overstay or status violation against the person,” said Shao.

“USCIS’s page has been updated recently on Jan 25 and now states that – Non-immigrants admitted for the duration of status, generally begin accruing unlawful presence the day after their status ends, if they remain in US,” he pointed out.

This is similar to what the Trump administration had attempted during his earlier tenure, when they tried to change the rule to backdate unlawful presence to the point of time when the person violated status.

“Historically, someone admitted under D/S can stay as long as they are maintaining that status - such as being a full time F-1 student or J-1 exchange visitor. In cases of SEVIS termination, normally there are two things an international student can do - either apply to USCIS to reinstate your F-1 and SEVIS, or leave the US and try to get a new F-1 visa through the embassy.”

Shao added, “As part of the leaked Rubio memo (reported by online media) states that affected people should self deport and report to the US consulate or embassy for physical cancellation of their visa, it doesn’t seem like going back to apply for a new visa would be a great option.” (The email sent to a student, as seen by TOI, also has a similar wording).

Jath Shao and other immigration attorneys view that students should seek legal counsel to help them reinstate their SEVIS or in a worse case, immigration attorneys can defend them if removal proceedings are brought against them.

Hundreds of international students in the US are getting an email from the US Department of State (DOS) asking them to self-deport owing to campus activism. Immigration attorneys’ contacted by TOI affirmed this development and added a few Indian students may also be at the receiving end of such emails – for something as innocuous as sharing a social media post.It is not just international students who physically participated in campus activism but also those who shared or liked ‘anti-national’ posts that are the target of these emails, said an immigration attorney.This crackdown is based on social-media reviews being conducted by DOS (which includes Consulate officials). Thus, even new student applications be it for an F (academic study visa), M (vocational study visa) or J (exchange visa) will also come under such social media scrutiny. Applicants will be denied the opportunity to study in the US.According to the latest Open Doors report, there are 1.1 million international students studying in the US in 2023-24 of which 3.31 lakh are Indian students.As reported by Axios earlier, Marco Rubio , Secretary of State, has launched an AI-fuelled ‘ Catch and Revoke’ effort to cancel the visas of foreign nationals who appear to support Hamas or other designated terror groups. Axios further reports that more than 300 foreign students have had their student visas revoked in the three weeks that ‘Catch and Revoke’ has been in operation, there are 1.5 million student visa-holders nationwide.“On behalf of the United States Department of State, the Bureau of Consular Affairs Visa Office hereby informs you that additional information became available after your visa was issued. As a result, your F-1 visa with expiration date XXXXX was revoked in accordance with Section 221(i) of the United States Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended.""""The Bureau of Consular Affairs Visa Office has alerted the Department of Homeland Security’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which manages the Student Exchange Visitor Program and is responsible for removal proceedings. They may notify your designated school official about the revocation of your F-1 visa.""""Remaining in the United States without a lawful immigration status can result in fines, detention, and/or deportation. It may also make you ineligible for a future U.S. visa. Please note that deportation can take place at a time that does not allow the person being deported to secure possessions or conclude affairs in the United States. Persons being deported may be sent to countries other than their countries of origin.""""Given the gravity of this situation, individuals whose visa was revoked may wish to demonstrate their intent to depart the United States using the CBP Home App""""As soon as you depart the United States, you must personally present your passport to the U.S. embassy or consulate which issued your visa so your visa can be physically cancelled. You must not attempt to use your visa as it has been revoked. If you intend to travel to the United States in the future, you must apply for another U.S. visa and a determination on your eligibility for a visa will be made at that time.""According to immigration attorneys, the flurry of self-deportation emails that are being sent to international students stems from a March 25, internal directive dispatched by Rubio , directing mandatory social media reviews of existing international students already in the US and new applicants.“If the social media review uncovers potentially derogatory information indicating that the applicant may not be eligible for a visa, Fraud Prevention Units are required to take screenshots of social media findings to the extent it is relevant to a visa ineligibility, to preserve the record against the applicant's later alteration of the information,” states this internal directive.“Consular officers do not need to upload social media findings if the review does not reveal derogatory information, but consular officers must enter case notes stating they conducted a social media review which did not reveal derogatory information,” adds the directive.Rubio’s statement at an earlier press conference:At a press conference in Guyana on Thursday, in response to a question relating to the Turkish student at Tufts who has been detained, Rubio said: “if you apply for a visa to enter the United States and be a student and you tell us that the reason why you’re coming to the United States is not just because you want to write op-eds, but because you want to participate in movements that are involved in doing things like vandalizing universities, harassing students, taking over buildings, creating a ruckus, we’re not going to give you a visa. If you lie to us and get a visa and then enter the United States and with that visa participate in that sort of activity, we’re going to take away your visa.”“Now, once you’ve lost your visa, you’re no longer legally in the United States, and we have a right, like every country in the world has a right, to remove you from our country. So it’s just that simple.”“I think it’s crazy – I think it’s stupid for any country in the world to welcome people into their country that are going to go to their universities as visitors – they’re visitors – and say I’m going to your universities to start a riot, I’m going to your universities to take over a library and harass people. I don’t care what movement you’re involved in. Why would any country in the world allow people to come and disrupt? We gave you a visa to come and study and get a degree, not to become a social activist that tears up our university campuses. And if we’ve given you a visa and then you decide to do that, we’re going to take it away…Once your visa is revoked, you’re illegally in the country and you have to leave. Every country in the world has a right to decide who comes in as a visitor and who doesn’t”.",Hundreds of international students in the US are getting an email from the US Department of State asking them to self-deport owing to campus activism.

Elon Musk's multi-million dollar election gambit triggers legal battle,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/elon-musks-multi-million-dollar-election-gambit-triggers-legal-battle/articleshow/119674908.cms,"File photo of Elon Musk (Pic credit: AP)

Billionaire and close US President Donald Trump ally Elon Musk is facing swift legal action following his promise to give $1 million to two voters in Wisconsin's Supreme Court race. The move is seen as Musk's latest effort to leverage his immense wealth to influence critical US elections.Wisconsin attorney general Josh Kaul announced on Instagram that his office was ""aware of the offer recently posted by Elon Musk"" and confirmed plans to ""take legal action today to seek a court order to stop this from happening.""Musk, the world's richest man and a key advisor to President Donald Trump, has already invested millions to support Republican candidate Brad Schimel. If elected, Schimel would shift Wisconsin's Supreme Court to a conservative majority, a change that could have far-reaching implications in the battleground state.In a post on X, the social media platform he owns, Musk declared that he would ""hand over checks for a million dollars"" to two individuals who sign a petition opposing ""activist judges""—a term frequently used by Republicans to criticise judicial rulings unfavorable to Trump's policies. Additionally, Musk pledged $100 to every person who signs the petition.The Wisconsin Supreme Court is set to rule on crucial issues in the coming term, including abortion access and voting regulations ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. Schimel has garnered strong support from Trump, who recently emphasised the significance of the race on his Truth Social platform, calling it ""really big and important.""Musk's offer in Wisconsin mirrors similar high-stakes financial interventions he has made in battleground states during the ongoing presidential election cycle. His growing political involvement comes alongside his companies' extensive government contracts and his influence in Trump's administration, where he has played a role in reducing spending across both foreign and domestic policy sectors.Meanwhile, Tesla—facing declining stock prices amid public backlash against Musk—has recently sued Wisconsin over the state's refusal to grant dealer licenses for its vehicles.","Elon Musk promises to give $1 million to two voters in Wisconsin's Supreme Court race.

Deportation flights

ordered to return

A federal judge in Washington, DC, extended a restraining order preventing the Trump administration from using a centuries-old wartime law to deport Venezuelan nationals accused of gang affiliation , reports Fox news.The order was issued by US district judge James Boasberg on Friday and is set to remain in place until at least April 12.The Trump administration had invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport individuals it claims are members of the Tren de Aragua (TdA), a violent Venezuelan gang. However, Boasberg ruled that more time was needed to assess the legal arguments surrounding its use.In a separate ruling on Friday, a federal judge in Boston also blocked the deportation of migrants to countries with which they have no existing ties unless they are given the chance to contest the move in court.The Trump administration swiftly reacted to Boasberg’s decision, filing an emergency appeal in a higher court. Meanwhile, U.S. Acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris urged the Supreme Court to review the ruling, arguing that it ""limits the administration's ability to protect the Nation against foreign terrorist organizations.""Harris also claimed the lower court's orders were ""flawed"" and could disrupt ""sensitive negotiations"" with foreign governments. She warned of ""serious and perhaps irreparable harm"" if the restraining order remained in place.Boasberg had initially issued a temporary restraining order last week, halting deportations under the Alien Enemies Act and ordering that any planes carrying Venezuelan nationals or other affected deportees be returned.The Trump administration has since asked the Supreme Court to intervene, arguing that the lower courts are interfering with its immigration policies.Additional hearings on the matter are scheduled for April 8, with the Supreme Court also being asked to weigh in on the ongoing dispute. The administration maintains that its actions are necessary for national security, while opponents argue that mass deportations under the Alien Enemies Act could set a dangerous precedent.","A federal judge in Washington, DC, extended a restraining order preventing the Trump administration from using a centuries-old wartime law to deport Venezuelan nationals.

IMF Approves $2 Billion for Pakistan Under Loan Programme | Dawn News English

Pakistan's citizens may have to pay additional taxation as a new carbon levy is anticipated following a USD 1.3 billion agreement with the IMF for climate change initiatives PTI reported citing official sources.Alongside this, the IMF agreed to release approximately USD 1 billion as the second tranche of the previously agreed USD 7 billion loan.""The IMF team has reached a SLA with the Pakistani authorities on the first review of the 37-month extended arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF), and a new 28-month arrangement under the IMF's Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) with total access over the 28 months of around USD 1.3 billion,"" the Fund said in a statement.The total IMF loan now amounts to USD 8.3 billion with this RSF arrangement. Upon approval from the IMF's Executive Board, Pakistan would receive immediate access to approximately USD 2 billion to strengthen its balance of payment position.The new agreement requires additional commitments from the tax-burdened population, including a new carbon levy, increased water rates, and liberalisation of the automobile sector. Dawn newspaper reports that a reduction in power rates is expected, funded by reallocating the existing petroleum levy.Senior officials familiar with the SLA and MEFP indicated that the prime minister would announce an approximate Rs 7 per unit reduction in average electricity rates, effective from April 1, 2025.The implementation of new measures - carbon levy, water pricing and automobile sector reforms - will commence from July 1, 2025. Fiscal consolidation will continue through reduced energy subsidies and controlled development spending.Officials confirmed that whilst the government sought GST reduction on electricity, the IMF instead permitted the use of increased petroleum levy to offset power tariffs. A Rs 10 per litre increase in petroleum levy would provide approximately Rs 1.80 per unit relief.The government has agreed to implement a carbon levy of Rs 3-5 per litre or equivalent on all hydrocarbons, including petroleum products and coal, with gradual increases planned. The revenue will fund climate-related initiatives.Automobile sector trade tariffs will decrease from 10.5% to 6% by FY 2030, ending what both parties agreed was excessive protection. These measures require cabinet approval before implementation through the finance bill 2025-26.The authorities aim to achieve an FY25 underlying primary surplus of 1% of GDP minimum, maintaining consolidation in FY26. The focus remains on revenue mobilisation, spending efficiency and tax base expansion.Pakistan has committed to maintaining strict monetary policy to keep inflation within the SBP's 5-7% target range and preserve foreign exchange market functionality while building reserves.The RSF programme includes strengthening public investment processes, improving water resource management, enhancing disaster financing coordination, addressing climate-related risks, and promoting environmental-friendly transportation to reduce pollution impacts.",IMF Approves $2 Billion for Pakistan Under Loan Programme.

Pakistani YouTube star Rajab Butt has been charged with blasphemy following the launch of his perfume named ""295"", a reference to Pakistan’s controversial blasphemy laws.The case was filed after his video promoting the fragrance sparked outrage, particularly from the hardline Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), which places blasphemy at the core of its political agenda.Butt, who boasts millions of followers online, announced the perfume in a now-deleted video, referencing Section 295 of Pakistan’s penal code, which deals with blasphemy. The move triggered widespread condemnation, with TLP leader Haider Ali Shah Gillani filing a formal complaint against him on Monday.""There are numerous sections in the penal code, but why did he choose blasphemy-related sections to name a perfume?"" Gillani was quoted by the news agency AFP, accusing Butt of attempting to ""normalise"" disrespect towards religious laws.According to AFP, the police charge sheet confirms that Butt has been charged under both blasphemy and cybercrime laws. If convicted, he faces up to 10 years in prison.As the controversy increased, Butt released an apology video on Sunday, holding a Quran as he sought forgiveness. ""I apologise for the words I uttered during the launch of the perfume,"" he said. He also announced the immediate discontinuation of the product.The controversy also relates to the late Indian rapper Sidhu Moose Wala ’s song ""295,"" which also referenced blasphemy laws. Butt had previously likened himself to Moose Wala, claiming they both faced persecution under similar legal provisions, according to Daily Pakistan.This is not Butt’s first legal battle. In January, he pleaded guilty to illegally owning a lion cub, which he had received as a wedding gift.A Pakistani court ordered him to create 12 educational videos on animal welfare as part of his punishment. He avoided jail time by pledging to use his platform to raise awareness about responsible treatment of wild animals.Blasphemy remains an extremely sensitive issue in Pakistan, where accusations, often unverified, can lead to mob violence and even killings.The legal provisions under Section 295 have been widely criticised by human rights groups for being used as a tool to target individuals, including religious minorities and public figures.","Pakistani YouTube star Rajab Butt has been charged with blasphemy following the launch of his perfume named ""295,"" a reference to Pakistan’s controversial blasphemy laws.

QUETTA: The Balochistan government , under the leadership of chief minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti , has decided to take stringent measures against government employees involved in anti-state activities , as reported by ARY News.In a high-level meeting chaired by CM Bugti, which was attended by the IG Balochistan and the chief secretary, the government announced that it would target individuals involved in anti-state propaganda and activism.According to ARY News, CM Bugti instructed all commissioners and district officers to act swiftly against any government employees suspected of promoting anti-state narratives or participating in activities that challenge the state's authority. The government's move appears to be a direct attempt to suppress activism and dissent within the province, especially among those critical of the state's policies. Bugti also confirmed that individuals involved in such actions would be placed under strict surveillance by being added to the Fourth Schedule for closer monitoring.ARY News also reported that CM Bugti directed all heads of educational institutions in the province to ensure the national flag is hoisted and the national anthem is recited regularly. Educational leaders who fail to enforce these directives are being told to resign, which signals a heightened crackdown on any form of resistance within these spaces.This renewed focus on stifling activism in Balochistan reflects the government's broader strategy to assert control over the region, including monitoring and potentially silencing any opposition to its policies.This comes amidst the detention of Baloch leaders and activists. Activists in the Balochistan region have frequently organised protests and campaigns, calling attention to the region's marginalisation.In response, governments have implemented harsh crackdowns, often leading to the detention of Baloch leaders and activists. These actions have sparked widespread criticism from international human rights organisations, highlighting concerns over the suppression of political expression and the stifling of peaceful advocacy for regional rights.","The Balochistan government has decided to take stringent measures against government employees involved in anti-state activities.

Who is Mahrang Baloch?



Growing Baloch resistance



Challenging the narrative



Balochistan, a region rife with conflict, has become a powder keg as Pakistan confronts a growing insurgency and resistance movement, most recently illustrated with the hijacking of a train by the Balochistan Liberation Army.The shock attack resulted in around 60 deaths and brought to fore the boiling deep-seated tensions between the Baloch people and the Pakistani state.Following the attack, senior Pakistan ministers and army leaders held a special meeting to address the country's worsening security crisis.The Pakistan 'establishment', referring to the army, also turned its eyes towards more legitimate forms of protest.Pakistan police recently detained Mahrang Baloch , a leading human rights advocate and symbol of Baloch aspirations, igniting further unrest.Pakistan views the Baloch movement with increasing alarm, fearing the rise of separatist sentiments and challenges to its authority in the region, particularly because of Balochistan's vast area and crucial borders with hostile countries like Iran and Taliban-led Afghanistan.The arrest of nearly 150 activists, including Mahrang Baloch -- recognised by Time Magazine as one of its 100 Next Emerging Leaders -- has sparked international condemnation and raised concerns about human rights abuses and the suppression of Baloch voices in Pakistan.Pakistani authorities arrested Mahrang on Saturday under charges of terrorism, sedition, and murder after a protest in Balochistan's capital, Quetta, resulted in the deaths of three protesters.Mahrang Baloch, a medical doctor and leader of the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC), has been vocal about enforced disappearances and alleged extrajudicial killings in Balochistan.Her sister, Iqra Baloch, condemned her arrest, stating on social media that her visit to Hudda Jail was reminiscent of when she saw her father behind bars 18 years ago. “Back then, Mahrang was by our side. Today, she is not,” she wrote.Mahrang has been a key figure in protests against enforced disappearances. Her father, Abdul Gaffar Langove, a nationalist leader, was forcibly disappeared in 2009, and his body was found three years later in Lasbela district, according to BBC.Since then, she took the decision to fight against enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings. Now, the 32-year-old is continuing activism despite odds thrown at her, which include death threats, travel bans, detention etc.In December 2023, she helped organise a major march to Islamabad calling for action against enforced disappearances, which was met with police crackdowns.Mahrang's family has also alleged that authorities have denied them permission to meet her in jail or deliver food.Support for the Baloch resistance, both violent and non-violent, has been growing, especially among the youth.Many have been radicalised by ongoing human rights abuses in Balochistan, where an anti-insurgency crackdown — dubbed Pakistan's ""secret dirty war"" — has led to thousands of enforced disappearances and killings over two decades.Voice for Baloch Missing Persons reports that since 2009, around 1,500 missing individuals have been found dead, often brutally tortured, while 6,000 remain missing.Human rights groups say extrajudicial killings are rising, but the military denies involvement.Faith in political solutions has also eroded after allegations of military interference in the 2018 and 2024 elections, which sidelined popular Baloch nationalist leaders.Pakistan has been battling a separatist insurgency in Balochistan for years, with militant groups targeting security forces and foreign nationals.Authorities have often pointed towards the terror activities of the BLA to justify brutal crackdown, arrests and torture of Baloch residents.A major part of the Maharang's movement, however, is based on peaceful advocacy, which observers say presents a challenge to the state's narrative.The province, which is also the poorest, accounts for the lion's share of Pakistan’s total landmass but only 6% of its population, has been a site of insurgency and heavy military presence for decades.Activists claim that Islamabad suppresses political voices while exploiting the region's natural resources.Human rights groups argue that her arrest is part of a broader crackdown on Baloch activists. Protests, often led by women, continue in various parts of Balochistan demanding her release.The Pakistani government has not yet responded to calls for transparency regarding the charges against her.The arrest of Mahrang Baloch has scaled-up scrutiny of Pakistan’s policies in Balochistan, with rights groups calling for an independent investigation into the recent protests and the treatment of activists in the region.","Mahrang Baloch, a medical doctor and leader of the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC), has been vocal about enforced disappearances and alleged extrajudicial killings in Balochistan.

Why are Nepalis protesting?

What happened during the protests on Friday?

Kathmandu witnessed violent clashes on Friday as pro-monarchy protesters took to the streets demanding the reinstatement of Nepal’s former king, Gyanendra Shah.The unrest left two people dead, including a journalist and over 30 others injured, prompting authorities to impose a curfew and call in the army.The demonstrations by protestors were driven by growing dissatisfaction with Nepal’s political system, which has seen 13 different governments since the abolition of the monarchy in 2008. Many Nepalis blame corruption, economic struggles and instability for their frustration, leading to renewed calls for the return of the monarchy.""We need the country to return to monarchy and the king to come back because the political parties and system have failed,"" Rajendra Bahadur Khati, a pro-monarchy demonstrator, told AP.According to PTI, thousands of royalists carrying national flags and images of Gyanendra Shah gathered at Tinkune, chanting slogans such as “Raja aau desh bachau” (May the King come to save the country) and “Down with corrupt government.”The protests stem from a growing movement calling for the monarchy’s restoration, which has intensified since Gyanendra Shah urged his supporters to rally behind him in a Democracy Day message on February 19.Pro-monarchists have since held multiple demonstrations, including a large rally on March 9 when Shah returned from religious visits across Nepal. As per ANI, thousands of supporters had then blocked the entrance to Tribhuvan International Airport, disrupting operations.During the violence, protesters torched eight vehicles, vandalized the offices of Kantipur Television and Annapurna Post, and looted a supermarket, PTI reported. They also attacked the office of the CPN-Unified Socialists in Baneshwor. Authorities responded by imposing a five-hour curfew in several areas, including Tinkune, Koteshwor, Baneshwor Chowk, and Gaushala.Prime Minister K P Oli called an emergency cabinet meeting to address the unrest, while the Home Ministry blamed the protest organizers for the violence. ""The organisers themselves are responsible for such acts,"" the ministry stated, adding that those violating the law would face action.The protest escalated when demonstrators attempted to breach police barricades. Security forces responded with tear gas, water cannons, and blank rounds to disperse the crowd.","Pro-monarchy protesters took to the streets demanding reinstatement of Nepal's former king, Gyanendra Shah.

They chanted slogans like ""Long live the republican system"" and ""Take action against corrupt people.""Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre) chief Pushpa Kamal Dahal 'Prachanda' and other leaders addressed the crowd, reinforcing their opposition to a return of the monarchy.Police detained several demonstrators for defying restrictions and attempting to march toward the restricted New Baneshwor area.Tensions remain high as Nepal grapples with rising monarchist sentiment fueled by Gyanendra's recent public appearances, including a March 9 rally following his religious tour across the country.

King Charles III was seen smiling and waving to the public in London on Friday, a day after being briefly hospitalised due to side effects from his cancer treatment .The 76-year-old monarch was spotted leaving Clarence House in the back of a black Audi, reassuring well-wishers who had gathered outside.His appearance came after Buckingham Palace confirmed on Thursday that Charles had experienced “temporary side effects” from his ongoing cancer treatment, requiring a short period of observation in hospital.“Following scheduled and ongoing medical treatment for cancer this morning, the king experienced temporary side effects that required a short period of observation in hospital,” said the palace statement.The king had returned home on Thursday afternoon and was reported to be in “good form,” continuing his state duties, including reviewing government papers and making calls, as per PA news agency.However, his engagements for the rest of Thursday and Friday were postponed as a precaution, following medical advice. “His Majesty’s afternoon engagements were therefore postponed,” the palace added, with an apology to those affected by the cancellations.As per AFP, Charles was due to receive credentials from ambassadors of three countries on Thursday and had planned a visit to Birmingham on Friday. Despite this setback, his scheduled trip to Italy in early April is still expected to go ahead.Tourists who saw the king on Friday expressed relief at his recovery. “We were horrified when we heard the news yesterday,” said Julian Mati, a visitor. “To see him smiling and waving, it’s such a relief.”Charles’ health has been under public scrutiny since he announced his cancer diagnosis in February 2024, a rare move for a British monarch. The palace has not disclosed the specific type of cancer but stated that his treatment would continue into 2025.His illness comes at a challenging time for the royal family, with his daughter-in-law, Catherine, Princess of Wales, also undergoing cancer treatment. Kate announced in January that she was in remission after a period of treatment, according to AFP.Charles, who ascended the throne in 2022 following the death of Queen Elizabeth II, has focused on making the monarchy more transparent and modern. The palace had previously stated that the king wished to be open about his cancer diagnosis to “prevent speculation and in the hope it may assist public understanding for all those around the world who are affected by cancer.”Despite his health concerns, Charles has remained active in his royal duties. Since his diagnosis, he gradually resumed work, making several public appearances and even travelling abroad, including a visit to Australia and Samoa last year.His reign has also been marked by tensions within the royal family, particularly with his younger son, Prince Harry . Harry, who stepped back from royal duties in 2020, has had limited interactions with his father in recent years.",King Charles III was seen smiling and waving to the public in London on Friday.

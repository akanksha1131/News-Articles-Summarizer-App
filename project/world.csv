Her remarks criticized U.S. government priorities, linked free speech concerns to foreign influence, and referenced the handling of Jeffrey Epstein, triggering sharp backlash and support across social media.

Candace Owens Targets Macrons Again: 'Brigitte Puts On A Fake Wig, Lipstick And Declares War On...'

Candace Owens draws fierce reaction after naming Israel in controversial safety claim





A viral clip has pushed Candace Owens back into the center of America’s loudest political arguments. Shared widely across social platforms, the video shows Owens delivering a sharp warning about personal safety, power, and accountability. Her comments connect her own public profile with that of Tucker Carlson, and they land at a moment when political speech feels more combustible than ever.The reaction was immediate. Supporters praised Owens for saying what they believe others avoid. Critics accused her of crossing a dangerous line. What drives the clip’s momentum is not just its message, but its emotional force. Owens speaks with visible frustration, blending fear, anger, and distrust toward institutions she believes have failed ordinary Americans. That mix has helped the clip travel fast and far.Owens did not hedge or soften her words. In the clip, she said: “What happened to Tucker Carlson or me? You obviously know that Israel was involved, obviously. That is unbelievably apparent in their rhetoric, their name-checking us, they're calling us on stage, they're sending their goons out to harass us because we believe in America first and that we should stop getting involved in their interests.”She added, “And that it is unacceptable, frankly, that our government gives more flack to Tucker Carlson, our government representatives give more flack to Tucker Carlson. We don't even have a government in my view. We can't even protect the nation's most innocent. How do we even have a government? I guess that's a larger philosophical question.”The Epstein reference shifted the tone instantly. What began as a warning about speech and safety turned into a broader indictment of moral priorities in Washington. That pivot is why the clip resonates. It taps into long standing anger about power protecting itself while demanding restraint from critics.Whether viewed as reckless or revealing, the moment captures something real about today’s political climate. Trust is thin. Language is sharper. And viral clips now shape national debate faster than policy ever could.Also Read: “I don't have much time”: Candace Owens says Charlie Kirk appeared in her dreams with a disturbing warning about who betrayed him","Candace Owens sparked controversy after a viral clip in which she said Israel should be blamed if anything happens to her or Tucker Carlson.

During time in Italy, he documented personal growth and design work, stressing the project is driven by passion, not branding. The brand’s first release will be a journal sharing his creative process.

Kai Cenat Breaks Silence On Mental Health In Powerful 24th Birthday Message

Kai Cenat uses Twitch hiatus to build something bigger behind the scenes

I Quit





Kai Cenat remained quiet weeks before and had left fans guessing. Following the stress of the marathon intensity of the Mafiathon 3, the Twitch star appeared to disappear, suggesting burnout or even retirement. However, there was no turning back to creativity at Cenat, behind the apparent calm. He was redirecting it.As Cenat continued to stay silent on his Twitch channel, he slowly turned his attention elsewhere. The absence was deliberate. Out of the limelight he delved into something new, more leisurely, and very personal. He did not pursue numbers but got bent on growth, contemplation, and art. That option is now coming into sight.The first clue arrived subtly. At the end of a recent main-channel upload, Cenat revealed a second YouTube account called Kai’s Mind. The channel is intentionally understated. No hype. No algorithms chased. Just raw documentation. Viewers see workouts, reading practice, and early sewing sessions. The oldest video dates back to December 25, 2025, and the low view counts suggest it was never meant to go viral.That secrecy connects directly to his newest venture. During extended time in Italy, Cenat immersed himself in fashion production, visiting facilities and learning how ideas become products.This was not a casual interest. As he explained, “This is the first time I’ve had a passion for something besides content creation.” He later added, “This is not me sticking my name on a brand and money-grabbing,” making clear his intent to build something real.The result is Vivet, a fashion brand rooted in personal meaning. Vivet translates to “will live” in Latin, which Cenat views as a statement about evolving beyond one identity. The brand’s first release will be a journal that includes sketches, concepts, failures, and wins, offering fans a transparent look at the process.Cenat also revealed the symbolism behind the Vivet logo, known internally as ET3. “If you can see deeper, it’s an infinity symbol and a cross. I just wanted to add that to my flair.”For now, there is no firm launch date. What is clear is this. Kai Cenat did not disappear. He recalibrated. And this chapter is about intention, not noise.Also Read: “Supposed to be a secret”: Creepy 140-year-long YouTube upload is unsettling the internet for one chilling reason"," Twitch star Kai Cenat has revealed a secret YouTube channel called Kai’s Mind.

IShowSpeed drinks cow’s blood on stream and proves why fans tune in live





Streamer IShowSpeed has never been afraid of experiencing something new headfirst. He went to a new level during a recent livestream he organized in Kenya, though. During her trip to the Maasai mara, Speed entered into one of the traditional Maasai activities that immediately attracted fans worldwide.The moment unfolded live, without filters or edits. Before taking part, Speed paused to prepare his audience for what they were about to see. “Chat, viewer discretion, you might see blood,” he said. “If you don’t like blood, chat, I recommend leaving the stream. Just saying.” The warning only heightened curiosity as thousands stayed glued to their screens.A local guide explained the ritual carefully, emphasizing respect for tradition and the animal involved. “So this is the live extraction of blood from a live cow,” the guide explained. “Once they shoot the main vein, the blood has to come out. They have a calabash. … So once the blood is out, they have to put blood here. After putting blood here, they mix with milk.”He added, “Milk is already inside here. They will mix milk with cow blood and that is a very good dish. For us, the Maasai people, we have only three specific dishes. First, we have the blood, we have the meat, and now we have milk.”The guide added that all three “are full of protein.”As the cup was prepared, Speed tried to process what lay ahead. “Chat, I’m about to try cow blood for the first time,” he said. “Holy crap. What’s it taste like, though? Like Cinnamon Toast Crunch or something, like cereal?”His reaction after the first sip was pure Speed. “Chat, I just had blood,” he said, noting the mix tasted “salty.” Then came the celebration. “I’m really Maasai. I’m Massai!” He even went back for more, laughing as he added, “It deadass tastes like blood. … Let’s go!”Moments like this explain why Speed’s streams travel so far beyond entertainment. As he recently told fans, “I’m for the people that can’t travel… I try to give y’all the best experience, I don’t make a cut-down video. I show y’all a live experience. A raw, true experience of me being at that certain location. Whether it’s a country, whether it’s a safari, whatever experience it is. I’m your test dummy.”For viewers watching from home, the Kenya stream felt exactly like that. Raw, unfiltered, and impossible to look away.Also Read: IShowSpeed stuns Nairobi crowd after overpaying vendor during livestream","IShowSpeed went viral after drinking a traditional mixture of cow's blood and milk.

As the trial of the three Indian men accused of killing an elderly couple in BC begins, Crown prosecutor Dorothy Tsui said they were motivated by ""debt, financial pressure and greed"". The couple -- Arnold and Joanne De Jong -- were found dead in their home on May 9, 2022. Three Indian men, Gurkaran Singh, Abhijeet Singh and Khushveer Singh Toor, cleaned the couple's home room and gutters months before they hatched the plan to murder. After killing the couple, they took their credit cards, cheques and pressure washer.Abhijeet Singh ran a cleaning company and the company worked on the couple's home in July 2021 and April 2022.Gurkaran Singh and Khushveer Singh Toor both deposited cheques for more than $5,000 into their bank accounts, purportedly signed by Joanne De Jong, shortly after the murders.The Crown prosecutor said Gurkaran came to Canada on a student visa less than a month before the killing. He was supposed to go to Northern Lights College in Dawson Creek, BC but he never went to college.Soon after the murder, the three men fled British Columbia and rented a basement apartment in Surrey, where they lived together until their arrest in 2022.They have pleaded not guilty to the first-degree murder charges that they are facing.The trial began Monday and is scheduled for 40 days, where the Crown expects to call at least 24 witnesses. There will be a ""substantial body of circumstantial evidence"" linking the three men to the murders, including fingerprints, DNA on a weapon used in the murder found in the trunk of a car they used, cellphone records, financial records and evidence from electronic devices, the Crown prosecutor said.","Arnold and Joanne De Jong were found dead in their home on May 9, 2022.

The US State Department has revoked more than 100,000 visas in 2025, the highest annual total on record. The figure is more than double the roughly 40,000 revocations reported in 2024.The department said the increase follows a January 2025 executive order signed by President Donald Trump, which reinstated stricter foreign-vetting rules and expanded post-issuance checks. The revocations span several visa categories.Officials said about 8,000 student visas and 2,500 specialised work visas were cancelled. These cases involved visa holders who had encounters with US law enforcement for criminal activity. The majority of overall revocations, however, involved business and tourist visas, particularly overstays.A State Department spokesperson said many student and worker visas were revoked following arrests or criminal charges. Others were cancelled after reviews under enhanced screening procedures. Among specialised workers, cited offences included driving under the influence, assault, theft, fraud and drug-related cases.The surge comes alongside the rollout of a “continuous vetting” system. Under the programme, visa holders can be reviewed even after they enter the United States. In August 2025, the department said it was reviewing the status of around 55 million foreign nationals holding valid US visas.The enforcement drive also includes renewed use of the “public charge” rule. The rule allows visas to be denied or revoked if applicants are assessed as likely to rely on public benefits. Factors considered include health, age, financial resources and English proficiency.Officials said the policy is aimed at strengthening public safety and national security. They added that reviews and revocations will continue under the current framework.The scale of the cancellations has drawn attention from universities, employers and immigration groups. They have raised concerns about due process and the impact on international students and skilled workers. Earlier student visa revocations in 2025 prompted legal challenges and calls for clearer guidance.The State Department said additional reviews are expected to continue into 2026 as the expanded vetting measures remain in place.","US State Department has revoked more than 100,000 visas in 2025, the highest annual total on record.

""And airstrikes would be one of the many, many options that are on the table for the commander-in-chief.

America in decline? Data shows even its poorest states now outperform most G7 economies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/america-in-decline-data-shows-even-its-poorest-states-now-outperform-most-g7-economies/articleshow/126508653.cms,"America Isn’t in Decline, The Data Shows It Still Outpaces Its Allies/ Representative Image

'Trump Isolating America': Jeffrey Sachs’ Blistering Breakdown of Global Power Shifts | BRICS | G7

Share of the world economy: stability where others have slipped

Productivity and competitiveness: the transatlantic gap

Wealth concentration and capital formation

Billionaire Census 2025

Why others have struggled to keep up

A different kind of imbalance





For more than a decade, the idea of American decline has hardened into a familiar refrain. Polarised politics, institutional strain and a relentless cycle of domestic crises have made it easy to assume that US power is ebbing, particularly when measured against a supposedly rising China and a cohort of wealthy democratic allies. Yet when the economic data are examined alongside comparable figures from the G7 and other advanced economies, the picture looks far less straightforward.The United States remains an outlier among rich nations: not free of problems, but unusually resilient in output, productivity and wealth creation. That resilience becomes most visible when America is viewed not in isolation, but relative to its peers.In 1990, the United States accounted for roughly 26 percent of global gross domestic product. More than three decades later, and after repeated predictions of China’s inevitable overtaking, the US share remains virtually unchanged at about 25.9 percent, assuming Beijing’s own growth figures are accurate. That consistency matters because the global economy is far larger today than it was at the end of the Cold War, with US output alone reaching an estimated $30.62 trillion in 2025.The contrast with America’s closest allies is stark. When the Cold War ended, Britain, France, Italy, Japan and Canada together represented around 32 percent of global GDP.Today, that combined share has fallen to below 14 percent. This relative contraction reflects weaker productivity growth, demographic pressure and prolonged underinvestment, particularly in Europe and Japan.At a more granular level, per-capita comparisons underline the divergence. Using data from the International Monetary Fund , the US Bureau of Economic Analysis and the Census Bureau, Mississippi, the poorest US state by GDP per capita, now outperforms four G7 countries on the same measure, while West Virginia with the second-lowest per capita GDP surpasses all six non-US G7 members. Since 2020, US GDP per capita has risen by roughly $20,000, a gain no other G7 economy has matched even over much longer periods.Productivity has been a decisive factor in this widening gap. The United States has outpaced the rest of the G7 in productivity growth, both nationally and at state level, driven by technology adoption, capital depth and labour mobility. Europe’s struggle to keep up has been formally acknowledged at the highest levels. Mario Draghi’s 2024 report on European competitiveness , commissioned by the European Commission, warned that Europe is losing ground to the US and China in productivity, innovation and technological scale. Without EU-wide industrial policy, deeper capital-market integration, large-scale joint investment in digital and green technologies, and a break from what Draghi called a “small-state mentality”, he argued the continent faces a “slow agony”: weaker growth, declining industrial capacity, falling global influence and a shrinking ability to fund social and strategic priorities over time.The resilience of the US economy is also reflected in the accumulation of private wealth. According to Altrata’s World Ultra Wealth Report 2025 , the United States now houses 38 percent of the world’s ultra-high-net-worth population, individuals worth more than $30 million, a larger share than the next ten countries combined. In absolute terms, 192,470 Americans control approximately $22.3 trillion in private wealth.Also read: Why America keeps winning the billionaire game The pace of accumulation has accelerated rather than slowed. Altrata reports that the number of ultra-wealthy Americans rose by 21 percent in the past year alone. China, the nearest competitor, holds about $5.9 trillion across 54,020 individuals, a fraction of the US total. Germany, the United Kingdom, Japan, Hong Kong, Canada, France, Italy and India all trail at a considerable distance.This concentration is not confined to inherited fortunes. The United States continues to generate new wealth through entrepreneurship at a scale unmatched elsewhere. Of the world’s five richest individuals, Elon Musk , Larry Ellison, Mark Zuckerberg , Jeff Bezos and Larry Page , all are American and all built fortunes rooted in technology platforms that reshaped entire industries. Their companies function as capital-generating ecosystems, reinforcing US dominance in finance, innovation and market depth.Altrata’sadds another layer. North America’s billionaire population rose by 7.8 percent last year to 1,198 individuals, of whom 1,135 are American. Their combined wealth now exceeds $13 trillion, more than the market capitalisation of Apple, Microsoft and NVIDIA combined.By comparison, wealth creation elsewhere has faced structural constraints. China’s ultra-wealth population has continued to grow, but at a slowing pace, as tighter state control and trade restrictions weigh on its technology sector. Europe crossed the symbolic threshold of 1,000 billionaires for the first time, yet its growth remains more cautious and institutional, with less tolerance for the volatility that characterises US capitalism.That volatility, often criticised by regulators abroad, has proved central to American dynamism. The same conditions that unsettle other economies, rapid technological change, market swings, aggressive capital reallocation, have allowed the US to adapt quickly and continue generating new entrants at the top end of the wealth spectrum. In 2024 alone, Altrata found that 10 percent of individuals globally worth between $1 billion and $2 billion dropped below that threshold, yet in the US new billionaires replaced them almost immediately.None of this negates America’s challenges. Income inequality remains the highest in the G7, infrastructure investment has lagged, and healthcare costs remain structurally high. Public finances are under sustained strain: the US closed fiscal year 2025 with a federal deficit of roughly $1.8 trillion, only marginally lower than the previous year, adding to an already elevated debt burden. The economy also relies heavily on buoyant equity markets and continued investment in artificial intelligence, both of which remain vulnerable to shifts in sentiment and capital flows.But measured against its peers, the United States has not drifted into economic marginality. Instead, it has pulled further ahead at a time when many allies have struggled to adapt. Strong allies once amplified American power. Today, the imbalance runs the other way.Predictions of American decline tend to focus inward, drawing conclusions from political dysfunction alone. A comparative view, grounded in output, productivity and wealth, suggests something more complex: a country whose internal problems coexist with an economic position that remains, by global standards, unusually strong.","In 1990, the United States accounted for roughly 26 percent of global gross domestic product. Today, that share remains virtually unchanged at about 25.9 percent. Since 2020, US GDP per capita has risen by roughly $20,000, a gain no other G7 economy has matched even over much longer periods.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126509942,imgsize-925588,width-400,resizemode-4/american-economy.jpg"

Trump Pulls U.S. Out of 66 Global Bodies, Slams UN Groups As ‘Woke’ & Anti-American





Israel is set to immediately sever all contact with several United Nations agencies and international bodies following a review conducted after the United States’ withdrawal from dozens of international organisations.The move, Jerusalem said, was prompted by what it described as persistent bias, politicisation, and actions hostile to Israel by the affected bodies.Last week, US president Donald Trump withdrew the United States from 66 international organizations and treaties, around half of them linked to the United Nations, accusing the bodies of acting “contrary to the interests of the United States.”""After an examination and discussion conducted following the US withdrawal from dozens of international organizations, Israel's minister of foreign affairs @gidonsaar has decided that Israel will immediately sever all contact with the following UN agencies and international organizations. In addition, foreign minister Sa'ar has instructed his Ministry to immediately examine, in consultation with relevant government ministries, when necessary, the continued cooperation between Israel and other organizations. Further decisions will be made following thorough examination and an additional discussion,” Israel’s foreign ministry said through a post on X.The decision, effective immediately, applies to the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict; the UN Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women); the UN Conference on Trade and Development; the UN Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia; the UN Alliance of Civilizations; UN Energy; and the Global Forum on Migration and Development.The Foreign Ministry said it was ending cooperation with the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict after the agency included the Israel Defense Forces in its annual “blacklist” on children in armed conflict, alongside Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad.“Israel is the only democratic country to be listed, alongside ISIS and Boko Haram ,” the ministry noted, adding that Israel had already cut ties with the office in June 2024.The ministry said Sa’ar withdrew Israel from UN Women after it “deliberately ignored all cases of sexual violence committed against Israeli women on October 7, 2023.”It said Israel also exited the UN Agency for Trade and Development and the UN Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia over what it described as “virulent anti-Israel reports,” while accusing the Alliance of Civilizations of being “used as a platform for attacks against Israel.”Finally, the ministry accused UN Energy of being a “wasteful organization,” saying it exemplified the “excessive and inefficient bureaucracy of the UN,” and said the Global Forum on Migration and Development “erodes the ability of sovereign nations to enforce their own immigration laws.”Israel has long accused the United Nations of systemic bias, noting that more resolutions are passed against it each year than against all other countries combined.It has been especially critical of UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, accusing it, well before Hamas’s October 7, 2023, attack in southern Israel, of colluding with Hamas and promoting anti-Israel incitement, allegations the agency denies.Citing what it describes as entrenched links to terror groups, Israel has banned UNRWA from operating within its territory and has restricted its activities in Gaza and the West Bank.","Israel is set to immediately sever all contact with several United Nations agencies and international bodies.

US President Donald Trump on Tuesday warned that the United States would respond forcefully if Iranian authorities begin carrying out hangings as part of their crackdown on a widespread uprising against the government.“We will take very strong action if they do such a thing,” Trump told CBS News in an interview, when asked about the possibility of hangings starting as early as Wednesday.“When they start killing thousands of people — and now you're telling me about hanging. We'll see how that's going to work out for them,” he said in a video clip from the interview released online.The interview was conducted while Trump was in the northern US state of Michigan, where he visited a manufacturing plant and delivered a speech focused on the economy.During that speech, Trump reiterated a message he had earlier posted on social media, saying that “help is on its way” for Iranian protesters. He also said the true scale of the death toll in Iran remained unclear. “I hear numbers — look, one death is too much — but I hear much lower numbers, and then I hear much higher numbers,” he said.Later, speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on his return to Washington, Trump said he was due to receive a briefing on the situation in Iran.“The killing looks like it's significant, but we don't know yet for certain. I'll know within 20 minutes — and we'll act accordingly,” he said.Trump has previously said the United States would step in if protesters were killed, a threshold that rights groups say has already been crossed.At least 734 people have been confirmed killed, although the actual toll is likely far higher, according to Norway-based NGO Iran Human Rights (IHR), as reported by AP.Concerns have intensified that the Islamic republic could turn to executions to suppress the protests after Tehran prosecutors said capital charges of “moharebeh,” or “waging war against God,” would be sought against some detainees arrested during recent demonstrations.“Concerns are mounting that authorities will once again resort to swift trials and arbitrary executions to crush and deter dissent,” Amnesty International said.IHR highlighted the case of 26-year-old Erfan Soltani, who was arrested last week in Karaj, a satellite city of Tehran. According to a family source cited by the group, Soltani has already been sentenced to death and could be executed as early as Wednesday.","US President Donald Trump says the United States will respond forcefully if Iranian authorities begin carrying out hangings.

Trump 'DECLARES WAR' On Khamenei, 'INSTIGATES' Iranians To Carry Out Coup | 'VERY BIG PRICE TO PAY'





President Donald Trump appeared to lash out at a worker who shouted pedophile protector during his visit to Ford Motor Company’s River Rouge complex in Dearborn, Michigan, on Tuesday, with video showing him seemingly responding with an expletive and the middle finger.Footage obtained by TMZ captured the moment as Trump toured the plant, pointing towards the person off camera before walking away and raising his middle finger.The visit took place hours before the president was due to speak at the Detroit Economic Club as part of his Michigan trip.While the man who shouted at Trump is not seen in the video, the insult is audible, though it is difficult to make out what else was said due to unclear audio.The outburst comes as Trump continues to face scrutiny over the handling of files linked to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who died in jail in 2019.Trump was criticised last year after pushing back for months against releasing the Epstein files, despite earlier suggesting during the campaign that they would be made public if he returned to office.A bipartisan group of lawmakers pushed legislation to compel the Justice Department to release its Epstein-related files, and the bill ultimately passed with overwhelming support, prompting Trump to reverse course and back the effort.Despite that shift, the Justice Department has missed multiple deadlines, including a requirement to release the files with limited redactions by mid-December and provide further details to Congress about the redaction process.Trump’s relationship with Epstein has remained part of the public debate, after he was photographed with Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell multiple times in the 1990s and early 2000s.Trump has denied wrongdoing and has not been accused by any Epstein survivors.","Donald Trump appeared to lash out at a worker who shouted pedophile protector during his visit to Ford Motor Company’s River Rouge complex in Dearborn, Michigan.

Trump's fundraising mail faces online backlash





November 2026 is an important month for Donald Trump . The US President will be facing midterm elections during this time and the results could not only determine the control of the House and Senate but also decide if the President will be impeached, for the third time.The 79-year-old has been worried about his fate since the beginning of 2026. At a recent House GOP retreat at the Kennedy Center in Washington, he asked his fellow Republicans to "" win the midterms because, if we don’t win the midterms, it’s just going to be — I mean, they’ll find a reason to impeach me.”From speeches to fundraising attempts, the President has been doing it all to ensure the continuation of his reign and one of his most recent fundraising emails was exposed on social media by left-wing Democrat influencer Harry Sisson.Sisson, 24, took to X and Instagram to reveal Trump's recent fundraising email that was allegedly sent to his supporters and allies. Titled 'I'm alone and in the dark.' the mail warned how American lives would change if Trump were impeached and asked for a donation.""Trump sent this creepy email to his supporters last night saying he’s “alone and in the dark” and he’s writing the message from a “dying laptop.” The only way to help him is to donate your money to him.Disgusting grift. Very weird!"" wrote Sisson in the caption of the post, attaching screenshots of the mail.Beginning with a photo of a serious-looking Trump, the mail reads: ""I'm sitting here. Alone. In the war room. Fighting for you. The rest of the staff went home hours ago. It's just me, one dying laptop, and the 72-hour countdown clock to my first mid-month deadline of the year just RANG.""He went on to warn that if he didn't ""crush"" his first mid-month deadline of the year, then the ""radical Left"" will ""open borders forever"", ""confiscate guns"" and ""brainwash kids.""""And worst of all, your favourite President (ME!) might just go through another FAKE impeachment!,"" he added.He went on to ask '$47' from every 'red-blooded American who wants to save the country.'In a related video he posted on Instagram, Sisson acknowledged that political fundraising emails from the left and right can get ""pretty weird"" sometimes, but the one sent by Trump recently, was ""insane and crazy.""""I wonder how people who fall for that, people who happily donate money to that clown, I wonder how those people would treat a desperate homeless beggar in the streets,"" commented a person under Sisson's X post.""Imagine stealing millions and still ask for donations"" added another.""He doesn’t want to use any of his own stolen billions?

When New York City mayor Zohran Mamdani said he was 'briefed' about US military's capture of Nicolas Maduro from Venezuela, critics laughed off and advised Mamdani to get down from the 'high horse' as he is just the NYC mayor. But as it turns out, Mamdani and President Donald Trump have been texting each other back and forth recently, Axios reported, citing two sources.The texting started soon after Trump and Mamdani exchanged numbers during their November meeting. It was the same meeting where Trump told Mamdani he was even better looking in person and the same meeting where Trump shielded Mamdani from an uncomfortable question. Mamdani was asked after his cordial meeting whether he would still call Trump a fascist. Trump saved him and said, “That’s OK. You can just say it. That’s easier. It’s easier than explaining it. I don’t mind.”Analysts said Mamdani charmed Trump or vice versa.While it's not known what they have spoken about in their text messages, Mamdani told the press that he had called Trump to express his displeasure with the US strikes on Venezuela. He was asked about Trump's response to it. Mamdani said he left it at registering his stance.Trump later told the New York Times that he was ""surprised"" by Mamdani's comment and ""thought it was awfully quick for him to be criticizing."" Using the past tense, Trump said that ""I did"" have a good relationship with Mamdani, but ""he hit me sooner than I thought.""One top administration official was surprised Mamdani made the call and thought he was out of line in doing so, Axios said, adding that Mamdani maintained that he is honest and direct with President Trump about places of disagreement.Insiders claimed that the recent text messages are friendly, as it's not practical for them to scream at each other and at the same time they can't appear too cozy.","New York City mayor Zohran Mamdani and President Donald Trump have been texting each other back and forth recently, Axios reported.

The authenticity of the account is not verified. It's also not known when the incident took place.According to the viral post, an Indian employee of the tech company who was on-site in the US for a project was picked up by ICE agents and was given two hours to pack all his belongings. He was given two choices: either go to jail or get deported. The techie chose the second one.The account said that he was escorted by agents and handed over to airport authorities, who were asked to ensure, by the immigration officers, that the man reached India and did not escape via Frankfurt transit. The X post said, the man was humiliated inside the plan with a public announcement that he would not be allowed to go anywhere when the flight landed in Frankfurt.In Frankfurt too, the man was escorted to his seat in the Bengaluru-bound plane and again a public announcement was made that he should get up from his seat until the flight took off. The post said his company lawyers came at the airport to receive him.

Final message from Scott Adams





As Shelly Miles, the former wife of Scott Adams, announced the death of the 68-year-old Scott Adams, the creator of the Dilbert comic strip, social media users offered their tribute to the writer and remembered how the Dilbert Principle taught them better about management than many serious management books. The Dilbert principle is a satirical odea about workplace management created by Scott Adams which says that companies systematically promote their least competent employees into management to minimize the damage they can do.It is not a scientific theory and is meant to be satire. Adams first explained the principle in a 1995 Wall Street Journal article, and he elaborated upon it in his humorous 1996 book The Dilbert Principle.""I wrote The Dilbert Principle around the concept that in many cases the least competent, least smart people are promoted, simply because they’re the ones you don't want doing actual work. You want them ordering the doughnuts and yelling at people for not doing their assignments—you know, the easy work. Your heart surgeons and your computer programmers—your smart people—aren't in management. That principle was literally happening everywhere,"" Adams explained.A last message from Scott Adams who was battling cancer, was released after his passing was announced. The message was written on January 1, 2026. ""For the first part of my life, I was focused on making myself a worthy husband and parent, as a way to find meaning. That worked. But marriages don't always last forever, and mine eventually ended, in a highly amicable way. I'm grateful for those years and for the people I came to call my family,"" the message read.Meandering through the milestones of his life, the message concluded with: ""I had an amazing life. I gave it everything I had. If you got any benefits from my work, I'm asking you to pay it forward as best you can. That is the legacy I want.""""Even though I knew his death was coming, as he told us it would, I still can’t believe he has died. Rest in peace, good and great man, rest in peace,"" Elon Musk wrote.President Donald Trump posted a message on his Truth Social remembering Adams as a 'fantastic guy'. “Sadly, the Great Influencer, Scott Adams, has passed away. He was a fantastic guy, who liked and respected me when it wasn’t fashionable to do so,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “He bravely fought a long battle against a terrible disease. My condolences go out to his family, and all of his many friends and listeners. He will be truly missed. God bless you Scott!”","The Dilbert Principle is a satirical odea about workplace management created by Scott Adams.

Downfall of 'Dilbert' comics





Scott Adams, the creator of “Dilbert,” a chronicle of the indignities of American office work, who also introduced the IIT-ian Asok through his comic strip, died at 68 of aggressive prostate cancer, according to his family.On Tuesday, Adams’ ex-wife Shelly Miles revealed his death in a tearful livestream of his YouTube channel Real Coffee with Scott Adams.In the video, Miles read aloud Adams’ farewell message in which he said: “I’m trying to be strong. If you are reading this, things did not go well for me. My body fell before my brain. I am of sound mind as I write this, January 1, 2026.”“If I wake up in heaven. I won’t need any more convincing than that. I hope I’m still qualified for entry with your permission, I’d like to explain my life,” Adams said before recounting his marriages as well as accomplishments including his books, illustrations and his YouTube channel.Adams revealed in May last year that he had been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer.In 1989, a young man working for Pacific Bell collected a royalties check from United Media for $368.62 for his comic strip Dilbert.This was the beginning of Scott Adams' career as a professional cartoonist.Dilbert soon became an icon to white-collar workers around the world, and its success landed Adams book deals, a TV show, and public speaking engagements across the country.Even after becoming a full-time cartoonist, Adams kept one foot in the corporate world.The strip gained rapid popularity during the 1990s and was syndicated in more than 400 newspapers by 1994.After leaving his corporate career to pursue cartooning full-time, Adams achieved significant success with his bestselling 1996 book The Dilbert Principle and the National Cartoonists Society’s Reuben award, which he won in 1997.Newspapers across the United States dropped the “Dilbert” comic strip over the weekend after its creator, Scott Adams, went on a racist tirade, calling Black Americans a “hate group” and suggesting that White people should “get the hell away” from them, NPR reported.The USA Today Network, which operates hundreds of newspapers, said it pulled the long-running comic strip. The Washington Post and The Plain Dealer in Cleveland also said they would no longer carry the comic.The move came after Adams effectively encouraged segregation in a rant on YouTube. His comments came in response to a poll from the conservative firm Rasmussen Reports that said 53% of Black Americans agreed with the statement, “It’s OK to be White.”The Anti-Defamation League noted that the phrase emerged on the message board 4chan in 2017 as a trolling campaign and has a “long history” in the white supremacist movement.“If nearly half of all Blacks are not OK with White people – according to this poll, not according to me, according to th is poll – that’s a hate group,” Adams said Wednesday on his YouTube show “Real Coffee with Scott Adams.”“I don’t want to have anything to do with them,” Adams added. “And I would say, based on the current way things are going, the best advice I would give to White people is to get the hell away from Black people, just get the f**k away … because there is no fixing this.”Adams later said on Twitter that he was only “advising people to avoid hate” and suggested that the cancellation of his cartoon signalled that free speech in America was under assault.Andrews McMeel Syndication, the company that distributes “Dilbert,” did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment.The newspapers that cut the comic strip issued statements to readers.“Scott Adams, creator of the Dilbert comic strip, went on a racist rant this week … and we will no longer carry his comic strip in The Plain Dealer,” wrote Chris Quinn, editor of the paper. “This is not a difficult decision.”“We are not a home for those who espouse racism,” Quinn added. “We certainly do not want to provide them with financial support.”Gannett, which publishes the USA Today Network of newspapers, tweeted that it aimed to “lead with inclusion and strive to maintain a respectful and equitable environment for the diverse communities we serve nationwide.”The Washington Post said it also pulled the comic strip.“In light of Scott Adams’s recent statements promoting segregation, The Washington Post has ceased publication of the Dilbert comic strip,” it said.","Scott Adams, the creator of the comic strip Dilbert, died at 68 of aggressive prostate cancer.

Do you not know what the word benevolent means bro?”Shirley became popular when uploaded a viral video alleging that 10 Somali-run daycare centers had misappropriated over $100 million in taxpayer funds in Minnesota.Following Shirley's video, the Department of Homeland Security launched a deportation effort in the twin cities aimed at deporting illegal Somali migrants. A DHS spokesperson also added in a statement that the Trump administration is 'all hands on deck to root out criminals in Minnesota who are defrauding the American people.'Moreover, FBI director Kash Patel in December also addressed Shirley's video by writing on X that the bureau had 'surged personnel and investigative resources' to Minnesota for the purpose of dismantling 'large-scale fraud schemes exploiting federal programs.'Currently, no arrests have been made by the administration over alleged fraud uncovered in Shirley's video.","Nick Shirley, 23, became an online sensation and hero after he uncovered the Minnesota daycare fraud.

Hate everyone,"" goes an old joke about bigotry. It was a prescription Adams embraced: Everyone should be free to hate everyone else to get ahead in life. ""I'm just saying: as a personal, career decision, you should absolutely be racist whenever it's to your advantage, and that's for men, for women, for black or white, Asian or Hispanic,"" he said in remarks a few years ago that eventually led to his cartoon strip being dropped by hundreds of newspapers across the US.Adams wasn't always like this although there was a dark hint of white exclusivism and primacy in him even as far back as the 1990s.In 1996, he introduced into Dilbert the character Asok, from the now famous Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), which wasn't as well known those days, to reflect the growing workplace diversity in America. In a 2003 interview with this correspondent, he explained that he got the idea of Asok from a co-worker of the same name when he worked at Pacific Bell. ""I modeled a character after him for the Dilbert strip because I wanted to add greater variety and bring an Indian to the mix to reflect the diversity of the American corporate world,"" he said.Asked why it had to be an Indian, Adams elaborated, ""Well, it was impossible to add an African-American. When you are as white as I am, you have to be careful. To make a comic strip character funny, you have to make him flawed, and that is a sensitive issue. I'm not sure other communities would have taken it well. Asok's flaw is that he is inexperienced, although he is smart and intelligent. It's a gamble that has paid off.""In hindsight, the phrase ""when you are as white as I am"" should have raised a red flag. Here was a writer, a social commentator, who appeared to be keenly aware of his whiteness and white exclusivity, and the handicap it placed on him in showing flaws in black people. Evidently, using an Indian as a strawman was fine because there were very few of them in the 1990s and there wouldn't be much trouble.As it turned out, Asok surfaced occasionally in Dilbert strips, often as a subject of derision despite his brilliance, most notably in an episode where he talks of his ability to heat up a cup of tea by just holding it to his forehead and imagining fire. Funny alright, but underlying the jibe was Adams' deep resentment over being passed up for promotion at Pacific Bell and Crocker National Bank, where he worked earlier, because he was white.In one strip, he has Asok saying he got promoted to senior engineer because ""I told my boss there wasn't much diversity in those positions"" – suggesting it was not based on merit. It is another matter that today, the CEOs of Microsoft, Google, FedEx, and IBM among other companies, are all Indians, many from IITs, and they did not come to occupy the c-suite due to affirmative action.Adams would later ""kill"" Asok in 2007, not sparing him of derision even in death by reincarnating him in 2008 as a part human-part Snickers bar -- because he had stored his DNA in a candy jar. All this was happening around the time Barack Obama became the US President. By the time Donald Trump took the White House, Adams' resentment had morphed into support for MAGA and its narrative of white victimhood. In 2022, he could eventually introduce Dave, the Black Engineer, to mock office diversity and transgender issues.Of course, the narrative of white victimhood and grievances did not prevented Adams from racking up millions from his comic strip, at one time syndicated in more than 2000 newspapers. Hundreds have dropped him now, but as Adams himself said, that will hardly impact his fortune. He continued to make his arguments about white victimhood and fear-mongering about blacks, notwithstanding the sage advice of Frederick Douglass, the social reformer and abolitionist, that the “white man's happiness cannot be purchased by the black man's misery. ”","Scott Adams, the creator of ‘Dilbert,’ a chronicle of the indignities of American office work, has died.

What is the Muslim Brotherhood?

Why it matters





President Donald Trump’s administration on Tuesday designated three Middle Eastern branches of the Muslim Brotherhood as terrorist organisations, imposing sanctions on the groups and their members in a move that could have implications for US ties with allies such as Qatar and Turkiye.The Treasury and State departments announced the actions against the Lebanese, Jordanian and Egyptian chapters of the Muslim Brotherhood, saying the groups pose a risk to the United States and American interests.The State Department designated the Lebanese branch as a foreign terrorist organisation, the most severe classification, making it a criminal offence to provide material support to the group. The Jordanian and Egyptian branches were listed by the Treasury Department as specially designated global terrorists for providing support to Hamas.“These designations reflect the opening actions of an ongoing, sustained effort to thwart Muslim Brotherhood chapters' violence and destabilisation wherever it occurs,” Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement.“The United States will use all available tools to deprive these Muslim Brotherhood chapters of the resources to engage in or support terrorism.”Rubio and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent were directed last year under an executive order signed by Trump to determine the most appropriate way to impose sanctions on the groups, which US officials say engage in or support violence and destabilisation campaigns that harm the United States and other regions.Muslim Brotherhood leaders have said they renounce violence.Trump’s executive order singled out the chapters in Lebanon, Jordan and Egypt, citing US assessments that a wing of the Lebanese branch launched rockets on Israel after Hamas’ October 7, 2023, attack that triggered the war in Gaza. The order also said leaders of the group in Jordan had provided support to Hamas.Founded in Egypt in 1928, the Muslim Brotherhood was banned in Egypt in 2013. Jordan announced a sweeping ban on the group in April.Founded in Egypt in 1928, the Muslim Brotherhood is an Islamist movement that began as a religious and social organisation before evolving into a major political force across parts of the Middle East. It advocates governance based on Islamic principles and has operated through a mix of political participation, social outreach and activism in different countries.The group functions through country-specific branches that operate independently while sharing a common ideological foundation. While the Muslim Brotherhood says it has renounced violence, several governments, including Egypt, have accused it of supporting or engaging in militant activity.Following the military overthrow of President Mohamed Morsi, a Brotherhood leader, Egypt banned the organisation in 2013. Since then, the group has faced varying degrees of restriction or prohibition across the region.Analysts say the US designation could reshape regional diplomatic equations and complicate Washington’s relations with countries where the Muslim Brotherhood remains politically active or tolerated.Nathan Brown, a professor of political science and international affairs at George Washington University, said some US allies, including the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, would likely welcome the move.“For other governments where the brotherhood is tolerated, it would be a thorn in bilateral relations,” including in Qatar and Turkiye, he said.Brown also warned that the designation could have wider legal and humanitarian consequences beyond foreign policy.“I think this would give immigration officials a stronger basis for suspicion, and it might make courts less likely to question any kind of official action against Brotherhood members who are seeking to stay in this country, seeking political asylum,” he said.The move also revives a debate Trump had opened during his first term. The Republican president had weighed designating the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organisation in 2019, and some of his supporters have since pushed for tougher action.At the domestic level, the shift aligns with actions taken by Republican-led state governments. Florida and Texas designated the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organisation earlier this year, signalling growing political momentum in the US against the group.","The Treasury and State departments announced the actions against the Lebanese, Jordanian and Egyptian chapters of the Muslim Brotherhood.

The bigger picture: The internet has become a protest battleground





When mass protests erupt in Iran, one of the first responses from authorities is often the same: shut down the internet.The tactic has been used repeatedly during major unrest, limiting communication between protest organisers, slowing the spread of footage, and cutting off access to independent news. In Iran’s latest blackout, internet availability has reportedly collapsed to a fraction of normal levels.Yet even when the lights go out online, some Iranians have found a way to stay connected. Increasingly, that backdoor has a name: Starlink.Starlink is SpaceX ’s satellite internet service, designed to deliver broadband from space rather than relying on fibre lines and mobile networks. That technical detail is what makes it useful during shutdowns.Unlike traditional internet infrastructure, satellite connectivity is harder for a government to switch off nationwide, because it does not depend on local towers and state-controlled telecom networks. Even during severe blackouts, some users have reported access through Starlink, although service can be unstable.For protest movements, that access can be critical. It helps people:Starlink is not authorised in Iran. Tehran has repeatedly declared the service illegal and treated it as a national security issue.Despite that, terminals have entered the country through informal channels. Over time, an underground ecosystem has grown around satellite connectivity, with Starlink devices becoming one of the most valuable tools for staying online during internet shutdowns. Estimates suggest that tens of thousands of terminals may now be inside Iran, sometimes serving multiple users through shared access.Iran’s crackdown has gone beyond cutting mobile data. Authorities have also focused on disrupting Starlink directly.Reports suggest Iran has attempted to jam Starlink signals, weakening reliability and making it difficult to upload videos and images. That matters because uploads are often the main way protest footage reaches the outside world.Iranian authorities have also taken steps to locate terminals, particularly in high-risk areas, where satellite dishes and equipment may draw attention.One reason Starlink remains relevant is that disruption does not always stay permanent.Starlink has tried to counter jamming through technical adjustments, including software updates designed to reduce interference. The result is an ongoing “cat and mouse” dynamic. Conditions can improve, then worsen again, depending on how aggressively interference is deployed and how quickly workarounds are introduced.For many users on the ground, it becomes a question of whether the connection works long enough to send out key information.For users, the danger is not only technical.Iran has moved toward harsher legal penalties connected to Starlink access, including proposals and laws framing possession as a serious offence tied to national security. Reports have said penalties could reach as high as 10 years in prison, adding another layer of risk for anyone using or transporting terminals.For years, one obstacle to satellite-based access in Iran was not only Tehran’s laws, but also sanctions compliance.In 2022, the US expanded authorisation for certain communication services, software and hardware intended to support internet freedom for Iranians. The shift helped reduce restrictions on tools designed to keep people connected during crackdowns and shutdowns.Iran has also tried to push back through international channels.Tehran has raised the issue within the UN’s telecommunications system, arguing that Starlink is operating without permission inside Iranian territory. The dispute highlights a key challenge for regulators: portable terminals and satellite coverage make enforcement difficult, even when governments object.Starlink’s role in Iran’s protests has also expanded into political headlines.Recent reporting has said President Donald Trump discussed Iran’s blackout and spoke with Elon Musk about restoring or strengthening Starlink connectivity. Musk has signalled that engineers were working on ways to counter interference and keep access available.Iran’s internet shutdown strategy is not only about censorship. It is about control.When access collapses, protests become harder to coordinate and harder to document. When Starlink works, even partially, it helps protesters bypass restrictions and keep information flowing.That is why Starlink has become more than a service during Iran’s unrest. It is a contested lifeline, shaped by jamming, underground networks, international disputes, and the growing reality that modern protest movements depend as much on connectivity as they do on crowds in the street.","Starlink is SpaceX’s satellite internet service, designed to deliver broadband from space rather than relying on fibre lines and mobile networks.

TOI correspondent from Washington:





US President Donald Trump has certifiably changed his mind on regime change. On Tuesday, the MAGA supremo directly encouraged a public uprising in Iran after imposing a blanket 25 per cent tariff on any country that continues to do business with the Islamic Republic in an effort to topple the ruling Islamic government in Teheran.""Iranian Patriots, KEEP PROTESTING - TAKE OVER YOUR INSTITUTIONS!!! Save the names of the killers and abusers. They will pay a big price….HELP IS ON ITS WAY. MIGA!!!” Trump posted on social media amid reports of a bloodbath in Iran following a crackdown on protests, unapologetically wading into Iran's internal affairs.Trump’s open backing for the revolt came hours after he said Iranian leadership had reached out to him for talks and the U.S was weighing a choice between military action and negotiations, with some senior aides, including vice-president J.D.Vance, reportedly in favor of the latter course. “There seems to be some people killed who weren’t supposed to be killed. We’re looking at it very seriously; the military’s looking at it. And there’s a couple options,” Trump said on Monday as reports of a bloody crackdown flowed out of Iran.By Tuesday morning, the U.S President appeared to have set his mind on effecting a regime change in yet another country (after similar approach in Venezuela and Cuba), announcing he has “cancelled all meetings with Iranian Officials until the senseless killing of protesters STOPS,” and pledging “HELP IS ON ITS WAY.”While Trump campaigned in the past against regime-change wars, his administration is now openly exploring tools to bring about leadership change in Iran and Cuba, after effecting one in Venezuela. He has reportedly been briefed on options ranging from long-range missile strikes to cyber operations and psychological campaigns in Iran, and even though White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said “diplomacy is always the first option for the president,” the temptation to pull off a coup in Iran on the back of widespread protests appears irresistible for now for Washington hawks like Senator Lindsay Graham.Analysts point to several reasons behind Trump’s evolution from opposing regime change to actively pursuing it in countries such as Iran, Venezuela, and Cuba. The administration views these governments as economically weak and politically brittle, believes coercive leverage can work without large-scale U.S. troop deployments, and increasingly frames them as part of a broader anti-American axis aligned with China and Russia. A more conspiratorial explanation by critics, who have dubbed Trump the ""Walt Disney of chaos"" is such frenetic activity is designed to distract voters from everyday issues at home.Many MAGA principals remain skeptical of Washington getting into another fracas in the middle-east. Former Trump aide Steve Bannon among others are berating Fox News and Graham for encouraging the latest caper, reminding them of the quagmire the U.S got into in Iraq. While most Democrats have uniformly opposed U.S interference in Iran, even some Republican lawmakers, the ""non-interventionist"" wing of the party have cautioned about getting into another fracas.""The Constitution does not permit the executive branch to unilaterally commit an act of war against a sovereign nation that hasn't attacked the United States,"" Thomas Massie, an anti-Trump Kentucky Republican said while introducing a bipartisan War Powers Resolution to block unauthorized hostilities against Iran.","US President Donald Trump has changed his mind on regime change.

‘Not 1, Not 1,000’: Jem Chief Masood Azhar Returns With Audio Threat As India Tightens Terror Noose

Def experts: Azhar’s statement sign of post-Sindoor frustration





A new audio recording purportedly featuring Maulana Masood Azhar , the elusive chief of terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), has surfaced on social media, boasting that his organisation now commands ""thousands"" of suicide bombers who are prepared for immediate deployment.The clip has surfaced at a time when Pahalgam attack mastermind and Lashkar-e-Taiba deputy chief Saifullah Kasuri was captured on video claiming that the Pakistani army had invited him to lead the funeral prayers of its soldiers after Operation Sindoor - conducted by India in May last year following the terror attack in J&K. Both clips were posted on Telegram and X by pro-ISI accounts.The messages are being viewed as a desperate propaganda attempt to revitalize a group reeling from devastating losses inflicted by the Indian armed forces during the operation. Kasoori's speech was made from a school with hundreds of children visible in the audience while Azhar too is seemingly addressing a public gathering, sources said.In another video, Kasuri has also welcomed the growing diplomatic and military ties between Pakistan and Bangladesh. The latest recording features a defiant Azhar claiming that the sheer number of his followers would ""cause an uproar in the global media"" if fully revealed.Azhar said new recruits are driven by the obsession of attaining ""martyrdom"".Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) Masood Azhar asserts that these recruits are driven by a fanatical obsession with “martyrdom”, explicitly stating that they do not seek material comforts like cars, motorcycles or foreign visas. “They only ask Allah for one thing: martyrdom,” the UN-designated terrorist claimed, attempting to project a picture of high morale and spiritual conviction among his cadre.However, defence experts suggested this was little more than a “hollow threat” and a sign of severe frustration arising out of Operation Sindoor, a series of precision strikes by India in May 2025 that decimated JeM’s infrastructure and eliminated at least 10 of Azhar’s close relatives and top aides in Bahawalpur.“This audio appears to be a calculated effort to save face after the group’s leadership was ‘torn to pieces’, as recently admitted by other JeM commanders,” said a source. Interestingly, Azhar has not been seen in public since a 2019 blast at his Bahawalpur hideout, leading to persistent rumours about his health and location.This latest audio, while lacking visual proof of his life, indicates that the terror mastermind is still attempting to operate from the shadows, deep within a safe haven in Pakistan. Security agencies are now closely analysing voice samples and metadata of the clip to track its origin and assess the current threat level posed by the group’s surviving sleeper cells, sources said.","New audio recording purportedly featuring Maulana Masood Azhar has surfaced on social media.

Open Letter From Pakistan Backs India As Baloch Leader Signals Diplomatic Break With Islamabad





A fresh surge of enforced disappearances has been reported across Balochistan, Karachi, and adjoining regions, with nine more Baloch citizens allegedly taken away by Pakistsecurity agencies in recent weeks.Human rights defenders stated that these incidents follow a familiar pattern: individuals are arrested without warrants, held in secret locations, and never brought before a court, as reported by The Balochistan Post.According to The Balochistan Post, sources in Mand, Kech district, stated that Abdullah, son of Iqbal, was whisked away and shifted to an unknown facility. In Karachi, 24-year-old student Hamdan, son of Muhammad Ali, was detained by CTD officials in the Golimar area, with no subsequent legal proceedings or public acknowledgement of his custody.On November 2, 2025, three youths, Dawood Baloch, Usman Baloch, and Hakeem Majeed Baloch, were picked up during early-morning raids in Bhatta Colony by teams from Military Intelligence and the CTD. Their whereabouts remain undisclosed.Additional cases include the late-night detention of religious instructor Zubair from Quetta's Lak Pass area on November 20; the abduction of labourer Muhammad Iqbal Marri from outside the Rakhni Sessions Court in Barkhan on December 26; and the raid in Mastung on 11 December in which Frontier Corps and CTD personnel allegedly took 21-year-old herder Saeed Ahmed.Families say none of these detainees have resurfaced. According to another report, 17-year-old student Jamal Murad was apprehended in Gwadar on 2 January by CTD and Military Intelligence operatives, after which he disappeared.The Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP) continued its protest camp outside the Quetta Press Club, marking its 6,052nd day. Families, including the relatives of Nasreena Baloch, reportedly detained during a raid in Hub Chowki, joined the demonstration.Her family stated that local police refused to register an FIR, while the Hub Press Club was locked to stop their press briefing, as highlighted by The Balochistan Post.VBMP Chairman Nasrullah Baloch accused state institutions of weaponising national security to intensify enforced disappearances, even targeting Baloch women. He said detainees are denied legal rights, courts are bypassed, and new laws merely protect extrajudicial actions.He called on national and international bodies to take meaningful steps to end the crisis and secure the release of all missing persons, as reported by The Balochistan Post.","A fresh surge of enforced disappearances has been reported across Balochistan, Karachi, and adjoining regions.

No IMF Loan In 6 Months? Pakistan Defence Minister’s Jet Export Claim Collapses Under Debt Reality





Pakistan on Saturday claimed that Iraq has expressed “keen interest” in acquiring JF-17 Thunder fighter jets and Super Mushshak training aircraft, following talks between the air chiefs of the two countries.According to a statement issued by the Pakistan Army, air chief marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu, chief of air staff of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF), met lieutenant general staff pilot Mohanad Ghalib Mohammed Radi Al-Asadi, commander of the Iraqi Air Force, during an official visit to Iraq.The discussions focused on enhancing bilateral military cooperation, including joint training, capacity building and operational coordination.“The Iraqi air chief praised PAF’s professionalism and technological advancement, expressed interest in benefiting from PAF’s world-class training and expressed keen interest in JF-17 Thunder fighter jets and Super Mushshak trainer aircraft,” the statement said, as quoted by news agency PTI.Both sides also agreed to pursue joint exercises and training initiatives to strengthen interoperability between the two air forces.The JF-17 Thunder is a single-engine, lightweight combat aircraft jointly developed by China’s Chengdu Aircraft Corporation and the Pakistan Aeronautical Complex.Pakistan has claimed that the aircraft proved its capabilities during last year’s conflict with India, although its effectiveness remains disputed.Pakistan had also deployed Chinese-origin J-10 fighter jets during the May 7–10 hostilities with India.The development comes days after Pakistan and Bangladesh air chiefs held talks on the “potential procurement” of JF-17 jets by Dhaka. However, Bangladesh has not officially confirmed any such plan.Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif recently claimed that the country has seen increased interest in its fighter aircraft following the May 2025 standoff with India. Reports have also suggested that Pakistan is exploring similar defence deals with other countries, including Saudi Arabia, amid ongoing financial pressures.Notably, Pakistan has repeatedly relied on International Monetary Fund support in recent years, with the IMF approving a $7 billion bailout in September 2024 and an additional $1.4 billion loan in May 2025.",Iraq has expressed “keen interest’ in acquiring JF-17 Thunder fighter jets and Super Mushshak training aircraft.

'Cry of a wounded conscience': Hindu man killed in Pakistan; sparks widespread protests in Sindh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/cry-of-a-wounded-conscience-hindu-man-killed-in-pakistan-sparks-widespread-protests-in-sindh/articleshow/126447724.cms,"Hindu Farmer Killing in Sindh Triggers Protests A Day After India Exposed Pak's Record on Minorities





Widespread protests erupted in Pakistan’s Sindh province after a young Hindu farmer was killed by a landlord in Badin.According to a report by Pakistan's news outlet the Nation, Kailash Kolhi was shot dead by an influential landlord, Sarfaraz Nizamani, over the construction of a hut on his land.Following Kolhi’s death, demonstrators staged sit-ins on the Badin–Hyderabad National Highway and the Badin–Thar Coal Road. Hundreds of vehicles remained stranded for hours as protesters demanded justice for the killing of Kolhi and vowed not to disperse until those responsible are arrested.According to a statement shared by activist Shiva Kachhi, the protest has been ongoing without pause.“The protest for the arrest of the killers of the martyred Kailash Kolhi is making history. Shiva Kachhi, Chairman of Pakistan Darawar Ittehad, is leading the historic protest sit-in. This was not just a protest—it was the cry of a wounded conscience. From 10:00 am yesterday until late into the night, the sit-in continued without pause, proving that the demand for justice cannot be silenced,” Kachhi said in a social media post on X.“Men, women, elderly people, and innocent children stayed on the streets with one voice and one demand: justice for Kailash Kolhi.Arrest the killers. Despite exhaustion, hunger, and the cold of the night, the determination of the protesters remained unshaken. Kailash Kolhi’s only ‘crime’ was that he was poor, marginalised, and courageous enough to exist in a system that protects the powerful and crushes the weak. The tears of his children, the grief of his mother, and the silent agony of his widow are today questioning the entire system: Is the blood of the poor so cheap?” he added.Earlier, the victim’s family and community members staged a protest by placing the body at Piru Lashari Stop, where the SSP Badin assured them that the accused would be arrested within 24 hours.The incident occurred four days ago in Raho Kolhi village in the Piru Lashari city area. Despite assurances from district police officials, the main accused has yet to be arrested.The ongoing protest has drawn participation from leaders and workers of several political, nationalist, religious, and social organisations, including Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI), Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), Jiye Sindh Mahaz, Qaumi Awami Tehreek, Jeay Sindh Qaumi Mahaz (Bashir Qureshi group), and Awami Tehreek, The Nation reported.","Kailash Kolhi was shot dead by an influential landlord, Sarfaraz Nizamani, over the construction of a hut on his land.

Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif in a controversial statement has urged the United States and Turkey to “kidnap” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu if they believed in justice and humanity, over the Israel-Gaza conflict.In a televised interview, whose clips have now gone viral on social media, Asif said the US should apprehend Netanyahu “just as Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro was taken away.”He added that Turkey could also seize the Israeli leader, and “Pakistanis are praying for it.”Describing Netanyahu as the “worst criminal of humanity,” Asif claimed that “no atrocities in history match those committed against Palestinians in Gaza.” He added, “No community has done what Israel has done to Palestinians in the last 4,000-5,000 years. He [Netanyahu] is the biggest criminal of humanity. The world has not seen a bigger criminal.”Asif also appeared to raise the issue of penalising those he termed as enablers of such crimes, beginning a sentence with, “And what does the law say about those who support such criminals…” before the show’s anchor, Hamid Mir, interjected and called for a break.Mir warned that Asif’s remarks risked being interpreted as a veiled reference to US President Donald Trump, and indicated that Asif would not remain on air after the break.Pakistan does not have formal diplomatic relations with Israel and has historically expressed strong support for the Palestinian cause. Islamabad also maintains close ties with Iran, another regional critic of Israeli policies.The international criminal court (ICC) has previously issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu in connection with alleged war crimes in Gaza, a legal development referenced during the interview.","Khawaja Asif said the US should apprehend Netanyahu “just as Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro was taken away” He added that Turkey could also seize the Israeli leader, and “Pakistanis are praying for it” Asif also appeared to raise the issue of penalising those he termed as enablers of such crimes.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126438854,imgsize-837064,width-400,resizemode-4/khawaja-asif-file.jpg"
Gen Z uprising in Pakistan?

Is Pakistan heading towards a Gen Z uprising? A PhD student from the country has sparked a debate after critically examining present-day Pakistan, under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and army chief and de facto power centre Asim Munir , without naming either directly.The piece, written through a lens that shows contrast in powerful boomer generation and youth of Gen Z-Alpha, quickly struck a chord online and became a flashpoint for what many described as a quiet rebellion. It highlighted the widening divide between Pakistan’s ruling establishment, often referred to as “Boomers,” and its increasingly restless Gen Z population.The article, titled “It is over,” was written by US-based PhD student Zorain Nizamani and published in Pakistan’s daily The Express Tribune on January 1. It was later taken down, reportedly following pressure from the Pakistani military.“For the older men and women in power, it's over. The young generation isn't buying any of what you're trying to sell to them. No matter how many talks and seminars you arrange in schools and colleges, trying to promote patriotism, it isn't working,” Nizamani wrote.Writing from the perspective of Gen Z and Generation Alpha, Nizamani rejected what he described as an imposed narrative of patriotism pushed by those in power, arguing that such efforts no longer resonate with young Pakistanis.“Young minds, the Gen Z, the alphas, they know exactly what is happening, and despite your consistent efforts of trying to 'sell' your views of patriotism to them, they are seeing right through it. Thanks to the internet, thanks to whatever little education we have left, despite your best efforts of keeping the masses as illiterate as possible, you have failed. You have failed to tell people what to think, they are thinking for themselves. They might be a little too scared to speak their minds because they prefer breathing,” Nizamani wrote.He argued that forced patriotism, speeches and seminars cannot replace justice, opportunity and basic rights, and said young people clearly see corruption, inequality and hypocrisy despite censorship and propaganda.Nizamani also highlighted generational differences over economic freedom, writing, “The Gen Z wants erased restrictions on freelancing, the boomers want to increase regulations on freelancing.”Concluding his article, he wrote: “Boomers, we have had enough. We aren't buying your narrative anymore. It's worn out.”The article drew support from followers of former prime minister Imran Khan, who is currently incarcerated. The Canada wing of Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaaf (PTI) shared the article on X, highlighting its key points.“Zorain Nizamani's article ‘It is Over’ was removed from eTribune most likely for exposing the reality: DG ISPR's university visits are futile. The youth see through propaganda and are no longer easy to mislead or control,” the PTI Canada wing said.Pakistani activist Mehlaqa Samdani also linked the article’s removal to censorship. “Not surprisingly, this article is no longer accessible through the Express Tribune's digital edition, exactly the kind of censorship Zorain talks about,” she wrote.The episode has intensified online debate over whether Pakistan’s younger generation is moving from quiet disillusionment toward open resistance against an entrenched establishment widely seen as out of touch.","US-based PhD student Zorain Nizamani wrote an article on Pakistan's ruling establishment.

No IMF Loan In 6 Months? Pakistan Defence Minister’s Jet Export Claim Collapses Under Debt Reality

Pakistan's repeated reliance on IMF

Bangladesh shows interest in Pak's JF-17

Pak seeks JF-17 deal with Saudi Arabia





Pakistan on Tuesday expressed confidence that it may no longer need financial assistance from the International Monetary Fund within six months, with Pakistan defence minister Khawaja Asif claiming the country had seen a surge in aircraft orders following a four-day military standoff with India in May, Geo TV reported.Speaking on a Geo News programme, Asif made a fanciful claim while arguing that the May 2025 India-Pakistan conflict showcased Pakistan's ""resolve and military effectiveness"" to the world.Military tensions escalated in May 2025 after Pakistan-sponsored terrorists carried out a terror attack in Pahalgam, killing 26 civilians in April. India responded with a strong military operation, launching Operation Sindoor, under which it targeted and destroyed multiple terror camps and Pakistani military facilities.However, Khawaja Asif, appearing disconnected from the ground reality, made such statements after a Bangladeshi defence delegation met Pakistan's air chief to discuss a potential sale of the JF-17 Thunder, the multi-role fighter aircraft jointly developed by China and Pakistan.There are also reports of talks between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia to convert about $2 billion in Saudi loans into a JF-17 fighter jet deal, according to two Pakistani sources cited by Reuters.According to Arab News, several countries have since stepped up defence engagement with Pakistan.“Right now, the number of orders we are receiving after reaching this point is significant because our aircraft have been tested,” defence minister Asif told Pakistan’s Geo News channel.“We are receiving these orders, and it is possible that after six months we may not even need the IMF,” he said.Pakistan markets the Chinese co-developed JF-17 as a lower-cost multi-role fighter and has positioned itself as a supplier offering aircraft, training and maintenance outside Western supply chains.“I am saying this with full confidence,” Asif said. “If all these orders materialise over the next six months, we will not need the IMF.”Pakistan has repeatedly turned to the International Monetary Fund over the years, for financial support to stabilise its fragile economy, with such assistance tied to strict conditions including fiscal reforms, subsidy cuts and revenue-enhancing measures.In September 2024, the IMF approved a $7 billion bailout for Pakistan under its Extended Fund Facility (EFF), followed by a separate $1.4 billion loan under its climate resilience fund in May 2025, aimed at bolstering the country’s economic stability and climate resilience.Demonstrating Dhaka’s efforts to move closer to Islamabad, Bangladesh has expressed “potential interest” in acquiring the JF-17 Thunder fighter aircraft from Pakistan, along with plans to resume direct flights between the two countries from January 29 after a gap of more than a decade.The JF-17, jointly developed by China and Pakistan, was deployed by Pakistan against India during the May 7–10 hostilities. In November last year, Indian Air Force chief Air chief Marshal A P Singh said the aircraft was among at least five high-tech Pakistani fighters shot down during Operation Sindoor.This latest development and closeness between Pakistan and Bangladesh comes under the pretext of Dhaka's straining relations with India.Pakistan and Saudi Arabia are also in talks to convert around $2 billion in Saudi loans into a JF-17 fighter jet deal, as two Pakistani sources told Reuters, in a move that would deepen military cooperation between two Islamic nations. Pakistan and Saudi signed a mutual defence pact last year.The discussions highlight efforts by the long-time allies to operationalise defence cooperation at a time when Pakistan is under acute financial strain and Saudi Arabia is recalibrating its security partnerships amid uncertainty over US commitments in the Middle East.","Pakistani defence minister Khawaja Asif says country may not need IMF help in six months.

Pakistan’s Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry on Tuesday said that nearly 71% of terrorist incidents reported in 2025 originated from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP). He attributed this concentration to a “politically conducive environment and the flourishing political-criminal-terror-nexus which is flourishing there”.Data released by the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) reinforces the scale of the surge. KP recorded the sharpest rise in violence, with “fatalities rose from 1,620 in 2024 to 2,331 in 2025” — a year-on-year increase of more than 40%.The broader national picture is even starker. According to the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS), 2025 was the “deadliest” year in a decade, with 3,387 combat-related deaths. These included 2,115 terrorists, 664 security personnel, 580 civilians and 28 members of pro-government peace committees. PICSS said violence intensified in both “tempo and lethality”, pushing multiple security indicators to their highest levels in years.“Militant attacks climbed to their highest annual total since 2014, and the use of suicide bombings and small drones showed a clear upward trend,” the report said.Suicide attacks rose by 53%, while terrorist incidents overall increased to 1,063 — the highest since 2014.Security forces and civilians also bore rising costs. Security personnel fatalities rose 26% to their highest level since 2011, while civilian deaths increased by 24%, marking the worst toll in a decade. Injuries surged by 53% to 2,263, with sharp rises across all categories.The violence has been most acute in KP and Balochistan. In Bannu alone, Deputy Inspector General Sajjad Khan said 27 police personnel were killed in 134 attacks during 2025. Police carried out 168 intelligence-based operations, arresting 105 militants and killing 65, he said.Pakistan frequently accuses Afghanistan’s Taliban authorities of sheltering the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a militant group blamed for a sharp increase in attacks inside Pakistan since 2021. Afghan officials reject the allegations, insisting they do not permit their territory to be used for attacks against other countries.While the TTP operates independently from Afghanistan’s Taliban, the two groups maintain close ties.Relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan have deteriorated since October, when border clashes followed explosions in Kabul on Oct. 9 that Afghan officials attributed to Pakistan. Although Qatar later helped mediate a ceasefire, talks hosted by Turkey in November failed to produce a lasting agreement.","KP recorded the sharpest rise in violence, with “fatalities rose from 1,620 in 2024 to 2,331 in 2025’ The broader national picture is even starker. 2025 was the “deadliest” year in a decade, with 3,387 combat-related deaths.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126375028,imgsize-1338682,width-400,resizemode-4/photo-credit-ap.jpg"

ISLAMABAD: The polio vaccination campaign in Pakistan's merged districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa fell short of its target, leaving over 935,000 children under five unvaccinated, officials said, citing security challenges and population displacement as key hurdles, The Express Tribune reported.According to The Express Tribune, citing authorities, thousands of families from North and South Waziristan, Bajaur, and other merged districts have migrated to different parts of the country, complicating monitoring and vaccination efforts.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Khyber Pakhtunkhwa reported 19 polio cases in 2025, including four each in North Waziristan, Lakki Marwat, and Tank; three in Bannu; two in Torghar; and one each in Dera Ismail Khan and Lower Kohistan, as reported by The Express Tribune.Officials noted that staffing and operational support for WHO and Unicef programmes in the merged districts were reduced last year, while WHO funding cuts also affected campaign coverage, leaving children in these areas at heightened risk.In Sindh, more than 12,000 children under five were reportedly missed during the final polio drive of 2025 in Hyderabad and surrounding areas, according to The Express Tribune.Refusals were recorded mainly in Cantonment areas and municipal towns such as Hussainabad, Preetabad, Qasimabad, and Tando Jam, with absent households and parental refusals cited as primary reasons.Despite these gaps, the nationwide anti-polio campaign successfully vaccinated more than 44.6 million children across Pakistan, according to The Express Tribune.Punjab led with 22.9 million children vaccinated, followed by Sindh with 10.6 million, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with 7.15 million, and Balochistan with 2.58 million.Officials said contributions from other regions also added to the national tally.Authorities warned that without sustained vaccination efforts, particularly in displaced and high-risk populations, children in the merged districts remain vulnerable to polio, The Express Tribune reported.","Polio vaccination campaign in Pakistan's merged districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa fell short of its target.

Open Letter From Pakistan Backs India As Baloch Leader Signals Diplomatic Break With Islamabad





Baloch leader Mir Yar Baloch has raised a “serious threat” warning over deepening China–Pakistan ties, claiming that China could deploy its military forces in Pakistan’s Balochistan region in the coming months.In an open letter to external affairs minister S Jaishankar, posted on X on New Year’s Day, Mir Yar Baloch said Baloch representatives view the growing strategic partnership between Islamabad and Beijing as “dangerous.”He said Balochistan has “faced decades of repression under Pakistan’s control,” including what he described as “state-sponsored violence” and “human rights abuses.”""The people of Balochistan have endured Pakistan's state occupation, state-sponsored terrorism, and egregious human rights atrocities for the past seventy-nine years. The time has now arrived to eradicate this festering affliction at its roots, ensuring lasting peace and sovereignty for our nation, "" he wrote.In his letter to EAM Jaishankar, Mir Yar Baloch said that China and Pakistan are rapidly moving toward the final stages of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a major Belt and Road Initiative project led by Chinese President Xi Jinping that passes through Balochistan.“The Republic of Balochistan views the escalating strategic alliance between Pakistan and China as profoundly dangerous.We warn that China, in collaboration with Pakistan, has advanced the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) to its final phases,” he said.He warned that unless Baloch resistance and defence forces are strengthened, the region could soon see direct Chinese military involvement.“Should the capabilities of Balochistan's defense and freedom forces not be further bolstered and if they continue to be overlooked as per longstanding patterns, it is conceivable that China could deploy its military forces in Balochistan within a few months,” the letter stated.Mir Yar Baloch also said that any Chinese troop deployment without the approval of the local people could have serious consequences for the region.“The presence of Chinese boots on Balochistani soil without the will of the 60 million Baloch people would pose an unimaginable threat and challenge to the futures of both Bharat and Balochistan,” he wrote.China and Pakistan have repeatedly rejected claims that CPEC has a military angle, saying the project is only economic. India, however, has always opposed CPEC, pointing out that it passes through Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir and affects India’s sovereignty and security.Earlier this year in the Rajya Sabha, minister of state for external affairs Kirti Vardhan Singh repeated India’s stance. In a written reply, he said: “Government's position on CPEC is clear and consistent. Government has consistently protested to parties concerned over the inclusion of the so-called 'China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)', which passes through parts of the Indian Union Territories of Ladakh and Jammu & Kashmir under illegal occupation of Pakistan, as a flagship project of 'OBOR/BRI' and asked them to cease these activities. Any proposed participation of third countries or expansion of the so-called CPEC projects to third countries is unacceptable.”Mir Yar Baloch also praised India’s recent counterterror military actions, highlighting Operation Sindoor, which targeted key terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir after the Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 people.“We commend the bold and resolute actions undertaken by the Modi Government in the previous year through Operation Sindoor, particularly targeting terrorism hubs facilitated by Pakistan and directed against the Pakistani military in response to Pahalgam terror attack. These measures demonstrate exemplary courage and a steadfast commitment to regional security and justice,” he wrote.There has been no official response so far from the Union government, or from Chinese or Pakistani authorities, to Mir Yar Baloch’s claims.",Baloch leader Mir Yar Baloch has raised a “serious threat” warning over deepening China–Pakistan ties.

Why the annual exchange matters



Historical context



Limits of the agreement







NEW DELHI: India and Pakistan on Thursday exchanged, through diplomatic channels, the list of nuclear installations and facilities covered under the Agreement on the Prohibition of Attack against Nuclear Installations and Facilities, the ministry of external affairs said.The exchange took place simultaneously in New Delhi and Islamabad, in keeping with the provisions of the bilateral agreement that governs the protection of nuclear infrastructure in both countries.According to the MEA, the agreement requires India and Pakistan to inform each other of the nuclear installations and facilities covered under the pact on 1 January of every calendar year. Thursday’s exchange marked the 35th consecutive exchange of such lists, with the first taking place on 1 January 1992.The annual exchange has continued uninterrupted for over three decades, even during periods of heightened political and military tension between the two neighbours.The Agreement on the Prohibition of Attack against Nuclear Installations and Facilities was signed on 31 December 1988 and entered into force on 27 January 1991, following the exchange of instruments of ratification by both sides.Under the agreement, both India and Pakistan commit themselves to refrain from undertaking, encouraging or participating in any action aimed at causing destruction of, or damage to, nuclear installations or facilities in the other country.The scope of the agreement is broad. Nuclear installations and facilities covered under the pact include nuclear power plants, research reactors, fuel fabrication units, uranium enrichment facilities, isotope separation plants, reprocessing units and sites storing significant quantities of radioactive material, whether fresh or irradiated.The agreement also specifies that both countries must exchange information on the locations of these facilities, typically in the form of latitude and longitude coordinates, once every year.The annual exchange of lists is designed to reduce the risk of accidental, miscalculated or deliberate attacks on sensitive nuclear infrastructure during periods of conflict or crisis.By formally identifying protected sites, the agreement seeks to prevent scenarios in which conventional military operations could inadvertently escalate into a nuclear crisis. An attack on a nuclear installation, even with conventional weapons, could have catastrophic humanitarian, environmental and strategic consequences.Security analysts view the exchange as a confidence-building measure that helps maintain a minimum level of predictability between two nuclear-armed neighbours with a long history of conflict.Notably, the exchange has continued even during times of strained relations, including after major crises such as the Kargil conflict, the 2001–02 military standoff, the 2016 Uri attack and the 2019 Pulwama attack and Balakot air strikes.When the agreement was negotiated in the late 1980s, both India and Pakistan were moving steadily towards overt nuclear capability, though neither had yet conducted nuclear tests. Concerns over pre-emptive strikes on nuclear facilities, particularly in the context of regional instability, were central to the discussions.The agreement was one of the earliest formal nuclear confidence-building measures between the two countries and predated their 1998 nuclear tests, after which both openly declared themselves nuclear weapon states.Since entering into force in 1991, the agreement has remained intact despite the absence of progress on broader nuclear arms control or risk-reduction mechanisms in South Asia.While the pact prohibits attacks on nuclear installations and facilities, it does not restrict the development, deployment or use of nuclear weapons themselves. Nor does it include verification mechanisms beyond the annual exchange of lists.The agreement also does not cover missile bases, command and control centres or other strategic military assets linked to nuclear weapons.Even so, diplomats and experts argue that the continued observance of the agreement reflects a shared recognition of the dangers posed by attacks on nuclear infrastructure.More than three decades after it came into force, the agreement remains one of the few enduring pillars of nuclear risk reduction between India and Pakistan.In an environment marked by limited dialogue and recurring tensions, the uninterrupted annual exchange of nuclear installation lists serves as a reminder that both sides continue to acknowledge the need to prevent catastrophic escalation.For now, the routine exchange remains a rare example of sustained institutional cooperation between the two countries in the nuclear domain.","India and Pakistan exchange list of nuclear installations and facilities covered under the Agreement on the Prohibition of Attack against Nuclear Installations and Facilities.

ISLAMABAD: Traders across Pakistan have threatened a nationwide shutdown on January 16 if the government does not withdraw its decision to make the installation of Point of Sale (POS) machines mandatory, warning that the move would further burden small businesses and open new avenues for harassment by tax officials, as reported by Dawn.According to Dawn, the warning came during a protest rally held in Islamabad, where traders attempted to march from Aabpara Chowk towards the Red Zone to demonstrate against the Federal Board of Revenue's (FBR) directive.However, heavy police deployment stopped the procession near the Serena Hotel, forcing demonstrators to hold a sit-in at the spot.The protest was organised by the All Pakistan Anjuman-i-Tajran in collaboration with the Traders Action Committee and drew participation from shopkeepers and market representatives from Islamabad and Rawalpindi.Leaders of various trader bodies addressed the gathering, accusing the government of targeting small businesses instead of addressing large-scale corruption.Addressing the crowd, Ajmal Baloch, president of the Traders Action Committee in Islamabad, described the compulsory installation of POS machines as a ""black law"" designed to intimidate traders rather than reform the tax system.He claimed that under the guise of documentation, traders would be exposed to greater harassment and bribery demands by tax officials.Citing an International Monetary Fund assessment, Baloch alleged that corruption in Pakistan amounts to nearly PKR 53 trillion annually, with the FBR accounting for a major share.He accused the department of selectively targeting small shopkeepers while ignoring large-scale corruption.He also alleged that many FBR officials own assets beyond their known sources of income and that their families enjoy foreign education and luxurious lifestyles.The protest leaders also highlighted alleged irregularities in customs operations, claiming that consignments of legally imported goods had been seized and partially returned, while the rest allegedly disappeared, as highlighted by Dawn.Warning of tougher action ahead, the traders announced that if the government attempted to forcibly install POS machines or seal shops, they would block a major arterial road in Islamabad and stage a sit-in at Zero Point on January 16.They further threatened a countrywide shutdown strike if their demands were ignored.The protesters appealed to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to intervene and protect traders from what they described as arbitrary and heavy-handed actions by tax authorities, as reported by Dawn.","Traders across Pakistan have threatened a nationwide shutdown on January 16 if the government does not withdraw its decision to make the installation of Point of Sale (POS) machines mandatory.

"Pakistan: Asim Munir marries third daughter to brother’s son; top military chiefs, politicians in attendance",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-asim-munir-marries-third-daughter-to-brothers-son-top-military-chiefs-politicians-in-attendance/articleshow/126263566.cms,"Mass Exodus Of Skilled Professionals In Pakistan: Report Exposes Asim Munir's 'Brain Gain' Claim





Pakistan army chief field marshal Asim Munir hosted his daughter’s wedding last week in the garrison city of Rawalpindi, where she was married to her first cousin, Abdul Rehman, according to Pakistani media reports.The ceremony was attended by senior political leaders and top military officials but was kept low-key due to security considerations, with no official photographs released.Among those present at the ceremony were Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari, prime minister Shehbaz Sharif, deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar, Punjab chief minister Maryam Nawaz, the chief of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), and several serving and retired senior army officers, including former army chiefs.Pakistani journalist Zahid Gishkori said around 400 guests attended the event, which was deliberately kept subdued.Gishkori, in a video posted on social media platform YouTube, confirmed the family connection between the bride and groom. “Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir's daughter Mahnoor married his brother's son, ex-army captain turned civil servant Abdul Rehman Qasim,” he said.The groom, Abdul Rehman, is Munir’s nephew. According to local media, he previously served in the Pakistan Army as a captain before joining the civil administration through a quota reserved for army officers.He currently serves as an assistant commissioner.Munir has four daughters, and last week's ceremony marked the wedding of his third daughter.The wedding coincided with the arrival of UAE President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan in Pakistan on the same day, prompting speculation on social media about a possible link between the two events. However, Ghiskori said that the UAE president did not attend the wedding.Pakistan’s security and foreign policy under Munir remains critical. A report by Greek City Times said that global patience with Pakistan’s trajectory toward “religious extremism” was wearing thin, alleging that the country had moved toward a more theocratic posture while failing to curb radical elements at home.Another report by Asian News Post criticised Islamabad’s military-led approach to regional diplomacy, particularly in relation to Afghanistan, stating that the strategy had failed to stabilise borders or improve Pakistan’s international standing.","Munir has four daughters, and last week's ceremony marked the wedding of his third daughter.

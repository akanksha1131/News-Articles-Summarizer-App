Israel cabinet votes 'no confidence' in attorney general who opposed PM Netanyahu's dismissal of security chief,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/israel-cabinet-votes-no-confidence-in-attorney-general-who-opposed-pm-netanyahus-dismissal-of-security-chief/articleshow/119401193.cms,"Israel PM Benjamin Netanyahu and AG Gali Baharav-Miara

Why Netanyahu dismissed Shin Bet chief

Israel's cabinet passed a vote of no confidence in attorney general, Gali Baharav-Miara , on Sunday, days after the High Court of Justice, Israel's highest court, temporarily blocked the cabinet's dismissal of internal security head Ronen Bar over his failure to prevent the October 7, 2023 attacks by Hamas in Israel.Baharav-Miara had openly cautioned Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu against trying to replace Bar, the director of Shin Bet , whose dismissal from service was the first in the agency's history.Ahead of the vote on Baharav-Miara, protesters held demonstrations outside the Knesset and the prime minister's residence in Jerusalem, leading to scuffles with police, according to news agency AFP.Netanyahu's office, citing a cabinet meeting agenda, had said the government would hold the vote on Baharav-Miara ""due to her inappropriate behaviour and due to significant and prolonged differences between the government and its legal adviser"".The unprecedented moves to dismiss the Shin Bet chief and now the attorney general have widened divisions in Israel amid the resumption of its military operations in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip.Netanyahu has cited an ""ongoing lack of trust"" in Bar, who is expected to testify on April 8. The Israeli premier has insisted repeatedly ""it is up to the government"" who will head the Shin Bet.However, critics see two main reasons behind Netanyahu moving against Bar.The first was the latter's criticism of the Israeli government over the security failure that allowed the Hamas attack on October 7, the deadliest day in the country's history. The second was Shin Bet's investigation of Netanyahu's close associates on suspicion of receiving money linked to Qatar.Netanyahu's office has dismissed such accusations as ""fake news"".Following the court's initial ruling on Bar, Baharav-Miara said Netanyahu cannot name a new internal security chief.""According to the decision of the Supreme Court, it is prohibited to take any action that harms the position of the head of the Shin Bet, Ronen Bar. It is prohibited to appoint a new head of Shin Bet, and interviews for the position should not be held,"" she said.","Israel's cabinet passed a vote of no confidence in attorney general, Gali Baharav-Miara.

North Carolina wildfires continue to destroy buildings; mandatory evacuations issued

North Carolina issues 'Code Red,' signaling unhealthy air



Wildfires burn over 4,000 acres in North Carolina



South Carolina declares emergency



The devastating wildfire forced the public safety department to announce a mandatory evacuation in North Carolina's Polk County while South Carolina's governor has declared a state of emergency due to spreading fires.The North Carolina Department of Public Safety ordered mandatory evacuations at 8.20 pm Saturday for sections of Polk County, situated 80 miles (129 kilometers) west of Charlotte.""Visibility in area will be reduced and roads/evacuation routes can become blocked; if you do not leave now, you could be trapped, injured, or killed,"" stated the agency via social media.A shelter has been established in Columbus, North Carolina, according to the public safety department.The North Carolina Forest Service reports three active fires in Polk County, with two major blazes covering 1.7 square miles (4.4 square kilometers) to 1.9 square miles (4.9 square kilometers). Additional fires are burning in Burke, Madison, and Stokes counties, the latter bordering Virginia.Due to the three separate fires -- the Black Cove Fire , Deep Woods Fire and the Fish Hook Fire-- the North Carolina Division of Air Quality issued a ""Code Red"" alert signaling unhealthy air for Polk County, and a ""Code Orange"" in Rutherford County, signaling unhealthy air for people sensitive to smoke.Western North Carolina is still recovering from Hurricane Helene's September impact, which damaged Interstate 40's eastbound lanes and affected 5,000 miles (8,046 kilometers) of state roads and 7,000 private roads.Simultaneously, the New Jersey Forest Fire Service is managing a Wharton State Forest fire that began Saturday, consuming 2.7 square miles (7 square kilometers) by early Sunday. Firefighters have contained approximately half the blaze, as reported at 8 a.m. on their Facebook page.Officials evacuated two campgrounds. While 18 buildings were near the fire, the flames moved away from structures, avoiding residential evacuations. The fire's cause remains under investigation.Two major wildfires in Polk County, North Carolina, expanded significantly on Sunday, with both exceeding 2,000 acres and remaining uncontrolled.The North Carolina Forest Service identified four active fires in the county by Sunday evening.The two largest fires - Black Cove, which expanded to 2,076 acres, and Deep Wood, reaching 2,545 acres - remained completely uncontained.These fires were affecting timber areas across challenging steep terrain, spanning both state-owned and private properties within the Green River Gorge, according to the state's department of agriculture and consumer services.Approximately 250 firefighting staff from North Carolina and neighbouring states were actively working to protect residential areas and buildings from the advancing fires, as reported by the department.In South Carolina, Governor Henry McMaster declared an emergency on Saturday to combat the Table Rock Fire in Pickens County, which began in the Blue Ridge Mountains region.McMaster stated, ""As this wildfire continues to spread, the State of Emergency allows us to mobilise resources quickly and ensure our firefighters have the support they need to protect lives and property,"" supporting Friday's statewide burning ban.Officials requested voluntary evacuations near Table Rock Mountain on Saturday. The Pickens County Sheriff's Office suspended operations Saturday evening, planning to resume Sunday with ground crews, helicopters, and air tankers. The 110-acre (45 hectares) fire prompted authorities to request avoiding state Highway 11.","North Carolina issues 'Code Red,' signaling unhealthy air.

The ATF currently maintains approximately 2,600 agents and over 5,000 staff members, figures that have remained stable over time.Initial implementation involves reassigning roughly 200 ATF agents to FBI positions focusing on border-related criminal enforcement , according to CNN citing source.An ATF spokeswoman contradicted reports about FBI reassignments, stating on Saturday that ""the ATF will temporarily assign approximately 150 agents from existing field offices to other ATF field offices, where they will continue serving as ATF agents to support the surge initiative"" as part of border management plans.""It is important to clarify that this is a temporary reassignment of resources to bolster public safety and combat criminal organizations more effectively.

Fugitive businessman Mehul Choksi living in Belgium: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/fugitive-businessman-mehul-choksi-living-in-belgium-report/articleshow/119362229.cms,"<p>Mehul Choksi<br></p>

NEW DELHI: Fugitive businessman Mehul Choksi is reportedly living in Belgium's Antwerp with his wife, Preeti Choksi, after securing an ‘F Residency Card’ in the country, according to a media report.Indian authorities have reportedly urged Belgium to initiate his extradition to India after knowing his whereabouts, the Associated Times reported.Choksi, accused of defrauding Punjab National Bank of over Rs 13,000 crore, obtained residency in Belgium and secured an 'F Residency Card' on November 15, 2023, reportedly facilitated by his wife, a citizen of Belgium. According to the Carribean-focused media outlet, Choksi had fabricated his documents to Belgian authorities and misrepresented his nationality in his application process, failing to disclose the details of his existing citizenship.It is believed that Choksi was believed to be living in Antigua and Barbuda before travelling to Belgium and is planning to move to Switzerland.The matter came days after Antigua and Barbuda’s Foreign Minister EP Chet Greene said that Choksi is no longer on the island.Greene, who was invited to participate in the Raisina Dialogue, did not reveal where Choksi had gone and noted, “Mehul Choksi is not on the island. I am told he left Antigua for medical attention abroad (but) he remains a citizen of Antigua and Barbuda. The governments, yours (India) and mine, are working together on this matter.”Choksi departed from India in January 2018 after being implicated in the PNB case. His nephew, Nirav Modi, was also implicated and currently awaits extradition proceedings in London.In May 2023, Choksi informed a Mumbai special court that circumstances beyond his control prevented his return to India, contesting the label of 'fugitive economic offender'. He claims he did not leave to avoid prosecution and is not refusing to return, adding that Indian authorities suspended his passport.The ED approached the special court seeking to designate him as a 'fugitive economic offender' for avoiding their summons and to enable confiscation of his assets under applicable legislation.In May 2021, his disappearance from Antigua led to speculation about abduction by Indian authorities - claims disproven when he was located in Dominica. Some suggested he attempted to avoid potential extradition.Dominican authorities arrested him for unlawful entry, but he returned to Antigua on medical grounds with interim bail. The proceedings were halted in May 2022.Choksi disputed the illegal entry allegations, stating that individuals posing as police officers took him from his restaurant, Jolly Roger in Antigua, to Dominica by boat.In December 2023, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman informed Parliament that assets valued at Rs 22,280 crore had been recovered or liquidated to settle debts of wanted persons including Choksi.","Indian authorities have reportedly urged Belgium to initiate his extradition to India.

Judge rules Indian post-doc Badar Khan Suri should not be deported pending hearing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/judge-rules-indian-post-doc-badar-khan-suri-should-not-be-deported-pending-hearing/articleshow/119308958.cms,"Badar Khan Suri

TOI Correspondent from Washington:

A federal judge on Thursday blocked the Trump administration's effort to deport Badar Khan Suri , an Indian post-doc fellow at Georgetown University who has been detained by immigration authorities for alleged pro-Hamas activism, saying he should not removed from the US pending the outcome of the legal challenge seeking his release.Virginia Eastern District Judge Patricia Tolliver Giles did not rule on the merits of the deportation case itself but suggested Suri's habeas corpus needs to be heard first in an order stating he ""shall not be removed from the U.S unless and until the Court issues a contrary order.""Suri's attorney has said his client was abducted from his apartment in Rosslyn, Virginia, a suburb outside Washington DC, and is incarcerated in distant Louisiana, where the Syria-born Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil has also been imprisoned at a different facility.Khalil's attorneys too are fighting his deportation, and after accusing authorities of moving their client to a more conservative jurisdiction (Louisiana is a deep red Republican state), they got the case transferred to New Jersey.The detentions follow a Trump crackdown on liberal campuses where student activists have been protesting and criticizing -- both directly and on social media -- U.S foreign policy with regards to the Israel-Palestinian issue.The Trump administration says foreign students, even if they have Green cards and valid visas, are violating terms of their stay with political activism that pose a threat to US national security. Administration officials have warned that many more foreign student activists will be identified and deported.Free speech advocates maintain the administration's actions are a violation of the First Amendment, even with regards to foreign scholars, with some recalling campus anti-Vietnam war protests in the 1960s. “Badar Khan Suri’s detention is a clear violation of his constitutional rights, and he must be released,” Virginia Democrat lawmaker Don Beyer said Thursday, adding, “The ‘justification’ given for these violations of Mr. Suri’s right to due process is another violation of the Constitution: a blatant attack on the First Amendment.""The judicial interventions that are stalling the deportations has enraged President Trump, who says lawyers ""endlessly search"" for "" radical left judges "" to thwart the administration's effort to deport dangerous illegal immigrants, although the crackdown now targets even legal residents.According to a rough count by legal mavens, Out of 679 active federal district court judges, 384 were appointed by Democratic presidents, and 257 appointed by Republican presidents. In the Appeals Court, out of 179 active judges, 88 were appointed by Democratic presidents, and 89 were appointed by Republican presidents. Six of the nine Supreme Court judges have been appointed by Republican Presidents, including three by Trump.But the US President and his acolytes, including Elon Musk, are still unhappy and want Roberts to sign off on moves to impeach liberal justices balking at an imperial presidency they are aiming for, where the President's authority is unquestioned. Roberts, who has suggested the administration can go through with the appeals process rather than target the judges.In a series of posts, Trump raged that ""Unlawful Nationwide Injunctions by Radical Left Judges could very well lead to the destruction of our Country!""""These people are Lunatics, who do not care, even a little bit, about the repercussions from their very dangerous and incorrect Decisions and Rulings,"" Trump fumed, adding that ""No District Court Judge, or any Judge, can assume the duties of the President of the United States. Only Crime and Chaos would result.""Judges are now being openly identified as ""Obama judges"" ""Biden judges"" ""Bush judges"" etc depending on who and in what year they were appointed. Chief Justice John Roberts himself --- a Conservative Republican Bush appointee -- is under attack from MAGA for not consistently ruling in favor of Trump and resisting the move to impeach liberal judges.""If Justice Roberts and the United States Supreme Court do not fix this toxic and unprecedented situation IMMEDIATELY, our Country is in very serious trouble!""

Trump now broadens campaign of retaliation against lawyers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-now-broadens-campaign-of-retaliation-against-lawyers/articleshow/119389910.cms,"WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump broadened his campaign of retaliation against lawyers he dislikes with a new memorandum that threatens to use govt power to punish any law firms that, in his view, unfairly challenge his administration. The memorandum directs the heads of the justice and homeland security departments to ""seek sanctions against attorneys and law firms who engage in frivolous, unreasonable and vexatious litigation against the USs"" or in matters that come before federal agencies.Trump issued the order late on Friday night, after a tumultuous week for the American legal community in which one of the country's premier firms, Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, struck a deal with the White House to spare the company from a punitive decree issued by Trump the previous week.Vanita Gupta, who as a civil rights lawyer and a former justice department official has both sued the govt and defended it in court, said Trump's memo ""attacks the very foundations of our legal system by threatening and intimidating litigants who aim to hold our govt accountable to the law and the constitution.""In response to criticism of the memo, a White House spokesperson, Taylor Rogers, said, ""President Trump is delivering on his promise to ensure the judicial system is no longer weaponised against the American people. President Trump's only retribution is success and historic achievements for the American people.""The president has long complained that Democratic-leaning lawyers and law firms have pursued what he calls ""lawfare"" in the form of investigations and lawsuits against him and his allies that he claims are motivated by politics. Since being sworn into office, he has targeted three firms, but the new memo seems to threaten similar punishment for any firm that raises his ire or any lawyer who does.After Trump issued an order suspending security clearances for Paul Weiss lawyers, and sharply limiting their employees from entering govt buildings or getting govt jobs, the firm agreed to a series of commitments to get the president to cancel the order. As part of the deal, the firm said it would provide $40 million in legal services to causes Trump has championed, including his task force to combat antisemitism. Perkins Coie, another firm targeted by Trump, chose a different tack - suing him in federal court and getting a temporary restraining order against him.Trump's attacks on law firms, and Paul Weiss' decision to cut a deal rather than fight it out in court, have sent shock waves through the legal community. The sweeping nature of Trump's latest demand comes as he has also stepped up his public attacks on judges and the notion that the courts can tell him what to do or not do.","President Donald Trump threatens to use govt power to punish any law firms that, in his view, unfairly challenge his administration.

OTTAWA: New Canadian PM Mark Carney Sunday called a snap election for April 28, saying he needed a strong mandate to deal with the threat posed by US President Donald Trump, who ""wants to break us so America can own us"".The comments showed the extent to which relations between the US and Canada, two long-time allies and major trading partners, have deteriorated since Trump imposed tariffs on Canada and threatened to annex it as the 51st state.Although the next election was not due until Oct 20, Carney is hoping to capitalise on a remarkable recovery by his Liberal party since Jan, when Trump began threatening Canada and former PM Justin Trudeau announced his resignation. Upon being sworn in as PM on March 14, Carney had said he could work with and respected Trump. On Sunday, however, he took a more combative approach.""We are facing the most significant crisis of our lifetimes because of President Trump's unjustified trade actions and his threats to our sovereignty,"" Carney said after the governor general approved his request for an election. Carney now has five weeks to win over Canadians.

Anger and fear? More tourists are turning away from Trump's America,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/anger-and-fear-more-tourists-are-turning-away-from-trumps-america/articleshow/119389886.cms,"NEW YORK: In just a few weeks, the US tourism outlook has clouded as a result of some of President Donald Trump's policy decisions, which have angered some foreign visitors and prompted fear of a surge in prices and a stronger dollar.Foreign traveller arrivals US are expected to decline by 5.1% in 2025 compared to last year, against a previously projected rise of 8.8%, said a Tourism Economics report published last month. Since the report's publication, ""the situation has deteriorated further"", and the outcome will likely be even worse, Tourism Economics chief Adam Sacks said, citing ""effects of antipathy towards the US.""""A situation with polarising Trump govt policies and rhetoric... will discourage travel to the US,"" said Tourism Economics, a subsidiary of Oxford Economics. ""Some organizations will feel pressure to avoid hosting events in the US, or sending employees to the US, cutting into business travel,"" it added. The World Tourism Forum Institute said a mix of stringent immigration policies, a strong dollar and global political tensions ""could significantly affect"" global arrivals, ""potentially reshaping the nation's tourism sector for years to come"". Among residents of 16 European and Asian nations surveyed in Dec, 35% respondents said they were less likely to come to the US under Trump, while 22% were more likely.Tourists from Western Europe who made up 37% of visitors in 2024 are the most likely to choose other destinations, along with Canadians and Mexicans. The US Travel Association said early Feb customs tariffs would deter Canadians, the largest contingent of foreign tourists in the US with 20.4 million in 2024.In New York, which welcomed 12.9 million foreign travellers in 2024, the effect is already noticeable, with Canadians cancelling tour bookings and a drop in online searches for hotels or Broadway shows, NYC Tourism president Julie Coker said. She lowered her forecast for the year in Feb but said so far, only Canadians are saying no to Trump's America. ""We're not currently seeing anything from the UK or Europe,"" because it's too early, she said. But British and German authorities have warned their nationals to be extra vigilant with travel documents, over risk of arrest.According to Tourism Economics, tourism sector could lose about $64 billion in revenue in 2025. Experts also fear effects of tightening immigration policy on major US-hosted events, such as Ryder Cup (2025), FIFA World Cup (2026), and 2026 Summer Olympics.","Foreign traveller arrivals US are expected to decline by 5.1% in 2025 compared to last year.

A New Jersey mother has accused United Airlines of mistreating her disabled son during a flight from Tampa, Florida, claiming flight staff repeatedly pressured her to remove her disabled son's ventilator before take-off.Melissa Sotomayor shared her ordeal in a now-viral TikTok video, which has amassed over a million views. In the video, she explained that her son relies on a tracheostomy, ventilator, and portable oxygen concentrator due to his medical condition, which also affects his vision and hearing.Sotomayor said that she ensured all necessary medical documentation was in order before boarding, just as she had for their outbound flight with no issues. However, trouble arose on their return flight when a male flight attendant instructed her to remove her son's ventilator and oxygen concentrator for takeoff, claiming it needed to be secured.Despite providing documentation proving her son's medical needs, the situation escalated as two more flight attendants and even the captain approached her with the same demand. Sotomayor said she repeatedly explained that the equipment was essential for her son's survival, only to be met with dismissive responses. At one point, a United Airlines staff member allegedly told her, ""He'll be okay until we're in the air at a high enough altitude.""The crew reportedly suggested she might have to change seats if she refused to comply, leading to further distress. As the plane sat on the tarmac for over an hour, other passengers spoke up, calling out the airline's treatment of Sotomayor and her son as ""harassment.""Ultimately, the flight proceeded without her having to remove the equipment, but Sotomayor described feeling humiliated by the entire experience. She later escalated her complaint to United Airlines' corporate office, only to be told that the airline was following federal aviation administration (FAA) guidelines.Her video has sparked outrage online, with viewers calling for a boycott of United Airlines and urging her to take legal action under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Some commenters pointed out that airline staff are not permitted to ask for medical documentation at boarding, as such information is typically provided in advance.","Melissa Sotomayor claims flight staff repeatedly pressured her to remove her disabled son's ventilator before take-off.

A huge repatriation drive

Growing worries about deportations

Calls for international help

Zahra Mousavi, a women's rights activist, fled from Afghanistan to neighboring Pakistan in March 2022 after months of fighting and protesting the oppressive Taliban regime She now lives in hiding and constant fear of being apprehended by the Pakistani police and deported to her home country.Mousavi actively participated in street protests against the Taliban regime after the Islamic fundamentalist group seized power in the war-ravaged country in August 2021.She advocated for women's rights by taking part in public gatherings and demonstrations, and tried to make the voices of Afghan women heard in the rest of the world.But with the Taliban slapping broad restrictions on women and girls and gradually squeezing them out of public life, Mousavi was forced to leave.In Pakistan, however, she has struggled to secure the necessary documents to stay in the country.""I could not obtain a valid Pakistani visa for myself and my family due to high costs and Pakistan's strict visa policies,"" the 29-year-old told DW.""This led to my arrest by Pakistani police on February 22. They entered my home in plain clothes, conducted an intense search, and arrested both me and my young daughter, taking us to a deportation detention camp,"" she said.""We were kept there in extremely harsh conditions for two days and one night, and we were only released after providing guarantees and due to the pressure of human rights activists.""DW spoke to several other Afghan female activists, who are also living in hiding as Islamabad looks to accelerate deportations to Afghanistan.Jamila Ahmadi, 27, said many of her fellow Afghan women had already been sent back to Afghanistan and warned that their lives, as well as hers, were in danger.""My activism, especially my efforts toward women's capacity-building before the Taliban takeover, my reporting on Taliban crimes, and my involvement with the National Directorate of Security (NDS), has placed me in significant danger,"" Ahmadi said.""If I am compelled to return to Taliban rule, it would clearly be a certain death.""Many women's rights activists only sought asylum in Pakistan when the situation became untenable in Taliban-ruled Afghanistan.""In February 2021, I was attacked, resulting in a broken leg, but my determination remained unshaken,"" said Ahmadi.""Again, in September 2021, we were brutally beaten by the Taliban.""Pakistan has hosted millions of Afghan refugees for decades.But over the last three years, Pakistan's relationship with Afghanistan has deteriorated.Islamabad is angry with the Taliban authorities over the operations of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a militant group that formed in 2007 and has conducted numerous attacks on Pakistani security forces.As cross-border tensions escalate, concerns about the well-being of Afghans in Pakistan have increased.Islamabad is currently carrying out a huge drive to repatriate the roughly 4 million Afghans who have crossed the border in the past four decades.Pakistan already repatriated more than 800,000 Afghan refugees between September 2023 and the end of last year, according to the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR).Legal experts and refugee rights activists have criticized the Pakistani government's deportation plans, particularly when it comes to deporting Afghan women's rights activists .""Sending activists back to Afghanistan, where they are very likely to be subjected to torture at the hands of the Taliban regime, would put them in greater risk,"" Osama Malik, a refugee lawyer in Islamabad, told DW.Ahmadi said her health had been affected by the deportation drive.""Unfortunately, for more than a month, the Pakistani police have made life difficult for refugees, including issues with visas and visa extensions. My visa expired on February 25, 2025. My personal, psychological and emotional problems are due to not having a visa and being unable to extend it,"" she said.While rights groups have accused the Pakistani authorities of harassing Afghan refugees, Islamabad has denied the allegations and stressed that the removals were part of a 2023 campaign called the ""Illegal Foreigners Repatriation Plan.""There ""is no specific category for activists among those being deported,"" a Pakistani official, who asked not to be named, told DW. ""The responsibility of hosting Afghan refugees should not fall solely on Pakistan, as other countries can also accommodate them,"" the official added.Qaiser Khan Afridi, spokesperson for the UNHCR in Pakistan, said the agency was worried about the deportations.""UNHCR is especially concerned for Afghans who face a risk of harm upon return, such as ethnic and religious minorities, single women, journalists, human rights activists, and members of artistic professions like musicians.""""In view of these mounting challenges, UNHCR urged Pakistan to continue to provide safety to Afghans at risk, irrespective of their documentation status,"" said Afridi.Maria Noori, a 34-year-old activist from Kabul facing deportation, called on the international community to intervene and save the lives of Afghan female activists living in fear in Pakistan.""Being sent back to Afghanistan would mean facing torture, imprisonment, or even death. The international community must understand that deporting human rights activists, particularly women, is a direct threat to our lives, and immediate action is needed to protect us,"" she told DW.The lawyer Malik criticized Western governments for their inaction.""It is unfortunate that none of the Western countries have stepped up to immediately allow these female activists to travel to their countries,"" he said.Noori explained that the lack of a legal status and residency documents poses a big challenge. ""Additionally, we face harsh economic conditions, unemployment, lack of access to health care and education, and security threats from extremists.",Afghan women's rights activist Zahra Mousavi fled Afghanistan to Pakistan in March 2022.

While the raid successfully led to the detention of more than two dozen individuals, including foreign nationals, it quickly descended into disorder as locals swarmed the premises to seize valuables, as reported by the local Pakistani newspaper The Nation. Laptops, monitors, keyboards, and other electronic equipment intended for investigative purposes were instead carried away by opportunistic looters.Videos circulating on social media captured scenes of individuals, young and old, forcing their way into the building and openly making off with electronic devices. A large crowd gathered outside, and despite the presence of law enforcement, the looting continued unabated. Eyewitnesses reported that FIA officials struggled to control the situation, allowing the ransacking to proceed unchecked. Amid the chaos, some foreigners linked to the scamming operation reportedly escaped.Sources within the FIA, quoted by The Nation, indicated that the agency had been aware of the call center's illegal activities for some time but delayed action while awaiting approval from senior authorities. The center was allegedly involved in defrauding individuals across multiple countries, using Pakistani employees to execute scams and extort money.The individuals detained during the raid were transferred to the FIA office for further questioning. However, the agency has remained tight-lipped about the broader investigation, declining to provide additional details despite repeated inquiries. The FIA now faces criticism for its handling of the operation and its failure to prevent the looting during what was meant to be a major crackdown on international cybercrime.","Chaos erupted in Islamabad's Sector F-11 after a raid by Pakistan's Federal Investigation Agency spiraled into an unexpected spree of looting.

DHAKA: A fresh controversy convulsed Bangladesh on Friday after the National Citizen Party (NCP), launched by Nahid Islam - man who led the anti-Sheikh Hasina movement - alleged that efforts are being made by the ""army"" to relaunch the Awami League under a new name, "" Refined Awami League "", as part of an India-sponsored conspiracy.The allegations came on a day the army had to be deployed in Dhaka along with police in view of demonstrations by student groups and hardline Islamist organisation Hefazat-e-Islam to demand a ban on the Awami League. On Thursday, Bangladesh chief adviser Muhammad Yunus said there are no plans to ban the Awami League but individuals within its leadership will be tried for ""crimes against humanity"".In a Facebook post, NCP leader Hasnat Abdullah said the proposal for this ""Refined Awami League, led by Awami league members Saber Hossain Chowdhury, Shirin Sharmin Chaudhury and Fazle Noor Taposh"" was placed before him and two others on March 11 by ""the cantonment"", an apparent reference to the army.Referring to the last year ""July uprising"" that led to the ouster of the Hasina-led Awami League govt, he said, ""In July, your powerful movement helped us discard all prescriptions from cantonment and agencies. If you stand by us again today, if you join us on the streets, we will once again defeat this Indian conspiracy to rehabilitate the Awami League.""""We were asked to accept the proposal in exchange for a seat-sharing agreement for the next national election,"" Hasnat said, adding, ""at the cantonment, we were told that more than one political party has already been given this proposal, and they have agreed to the rehabilitation of the Awami League on certain conditions.""He did not tell who approached him. ""We were further told that those who will lead this 'Refined Awami League' will start publicly admitting to the crimes of the Sheikh family from April-May onwards, distancing themselves from Hasina while pledging allegiance only to Bangabandhu's Awami League.""

This statement comes a day after the country’s interim government announced that it had no plans to ban the party.BNP spokesperson Ruhul Kabir Rizvi said that Awami League’s political comeback should be contingent on its leadership being free from criminal charges.“There should be no restriction on Awami League's return to politics if it selects a leader who is not guilty of any crime, has not killed students, and has not misappropriated or laundered money abroad,” Rizvi said, according to news agency PTI.He further added, “We have nothing to say if the people accept Awami League after a swift trial of those responsible for crimes committed under their regime.” However, he warned against the return of authoritarian rule, emphasizing that democracy should determine the party’s future.Rizvi’s remarks came after interim government chief Muhammad Yunus assured a delegation from the International Crisis Group that his administration ""has no plans to ban the Awami League."" However, he clarified that individuals within the party accused of serious crimes—including murder and crimes against humanity—would face prosecution in Bangladesh’s courts.Yunus also indicated that Awami League leaders could be referred to the International Criminal Court (ICC) following a UN fact-finding mission that uncovered potential crimes during the July-August 2024 protests, which led to Hasina’s ouster. ""It is very much on the table,"" he said.Hasina has been in India since August 5, 2024, after fleeing Bangladesh amid mass student-led protests that brought an end to her nearly 16-year rule. The Bangladesh International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) has issued arrest warrants against Hasina and several of her former ministers, advisers, and military and civil officials for “crimes against humanity and genocide.”The debate over Awami League’s future intensified on Friday as two student groups from Dhaka University—the Bangladesh Democratic Students' Council (BDSC) and Inquilab Mancha—held separate protests demanding the party be barred from contesting elections.The BNP, however, has consistently opposed banning political parties. Following Hasina’s removal, the Students Against Discrimination (SAD)—which spearheaded the protests—also pushed for Awami League’s exclusion from politics. Some SAD leaders later formed a political party, the National Citizen Party (NCP), which is advocating for the establishment of a ‘Second Republic’ and the abolition of Bangladesh’s 1972 constitution.One of NCP’s key leaders, Hasnat Abdullah, claimed in a Facebook post that there was a “conspiracy to rehabilitate Awami League” under a refined version, allegedly backed by India. He alleged that on March 11, he and two other NCP members were approached by military officials with a proposal to accept the “Refined Awami League” in exchange for a seat-sharing arrangement.“We were told that multiple political parties had already agreed to the proposal on certain conditions,” Abdullah claimed. “According to them, having several opposition parties, including a weak Awami League, is preferable to having a single strong opposition.”He said the NCP outright rejected the proposal, arguing that Awami League should face prosecution instead of rehabilitation. However, those who made the offer allegedly warned that SAD and NCP would have to bear responsibility for any political crisis resulting from their refusal.Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI), a former ally of BNP, has also backed NCP’s stance on Awami League. JeI chief Shafiqur Rahman asserted, “People will not accept the rehabilitation of Awami League.”As political tensions rise, calls for accountability and justice remain at the forefront of Bangladesh’s evolving political landscape.",Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) says it has no objection to Awami League's return to politics.

Afghanistan is unfortunately prone to these shallow earthquakes, due to the region's tectonic plates often slipping past one another, as opposed to colliding directly.","A 4.9-magnitude earthquake struck Afghanistan on Friday, according to the National Center for Seismology (NCS) The earthquake occurred at a depth of 160 km, as per NCS data.

France embassy in Dhaka called a post ""ridiculous, baseless and intellectually weak statement"" which was claiming that they support Mohammad Yunus-led Bangladesh interim government's criticism against US intelligence chief Tulsi Gabbard on persecution of minorities in the country.Reacting to a post, France embassy said, ""How ridiculous, baseless and intellectually weak statement @kawsarc @mainul_haque @carmel_trish.""A former Navy official Manoj Rawat, sharing the screenshot of French embassy sharing the Yunus' statement on Gabbad's post in his post on X, claimed that they are supporting the Yunus Government 's criticism of Gabbard's statement on the genocide of Hindus in Bangladesh.He further said that it seems that the the Indo-French Strategic partnership is just a business arrangement for France to secure lucrative Defence contracts from India.""Time to call out the French mischief in the sub-continent,"" he said in a post on X.Bangladesh released a statement challenging Gabbard's observations, calling them ""misleading and damaging"" to the nation's standing.""This statement is both misleading and damaging to the image and reputation of Bangladesh, a nation whose traditional practice of Islam has been famously inclusive and peaceful, and that has made remarkable strides in its fight against extremism and terrorism,"" Bangladesh's interim government said in a statement.""Gabbard's comments are not based on any evidence or specific allegations. They paint an entire nation with a broad and unjustified brush. Bangladesh, like many countries around the world, has faced challenges with extremism, but it has continuously worked in partnership with the international community, including the US, to address these issues through law enforcement, social reforms, and other counterterrorism efforts. Bangladesh strongly condemns any efforts to link the country to any form of 'Islamist caliphate,"" the statement added.Bangladesh also urged Gabbard to base her statements on ""actual knowledge"" when discussing sensitive issues, warning that such remarks could reinforce harmful stereotypes.""Political leaders and public figures should base their statements, especially about the most sensitive issues, on actual knowledge and take care not to reinforce harmful stereotypes, to fan fears, and potentially even stoke sectarian tensions,"" the statement said.In media interviews later, Gabbard said the US was deeply concerned about the persecution of minorities in Bangladesh and the Trump administration was committed to defeat ""Islamist terrorism"" globally. She noted that PM Modi also took this threat seriously and added that the two leaders would work together to identify and defeat the threat.""The long-time unfortunate persecution, killing and abuse of religious minorities like Hindus, Buddhists, Christians and others has been a major area of concern for the US govt and President Trump and his administration,"" Gabbard told NDTV World.She spoke about the ideology of an ""Islamic Caliphate"" and how extremist elements and terror groups globally aimed for such an outcome. ""The threat of Islamist terrorists and the global effort of different terror groups are routed in the same ideology and objective - which is to rule or govern with an Islamist Caliphate,"" she said, adding, ""This obviously affects people of any other religion, other than the one that they find acceptable, and they choose to carry this out with terror and very violent ways and means.""Her remarks mark a strong indictment of Mohammad Yunus-led interim dispensation in Dhaka which had enjoyed support from the Biden administration.

The Dalai Lama’s succession has long been a point of contention between Tibetans and China, but his latest statement has escalated the dispute. In his newly published book,, the 89-year-old Tibetan spiritual leader has explicitly stated for the first time that his successor will be born in the ""free world""—outside of China. This defies Beijing’s longstanding claim that it has the sole right to choose the next Dalai Lama.For China, controlling the Dalai Lama’s succession is about more than religion—it’s about political authority and maintaining control over Tibet. The Dalai Lama, who fled to India in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule, has long been regarded as a “separatist” by Beijing. With his 90th birthday approaching in July, the question of who will succeed him has become urgent, as it could determine the future of Tibetan Buddhism and Tibet’s political movement. Below, we break down the key issues surrounding this controversy.Also read: ‘Will be born in free world’: Dalai Lama declares successor will be born outside China; Beijing counters China considers the Dalai Lama to be a symbol of Tibetan resistance and fears that an independent successor could fuel separatist sentiments. By controlling the reincarnation process, Beijing hopes to install a Dalai Lama loyal to the Chinese government, ensuring tighter control over Tibet. The current Dalai Lama, however, has made it clear that any successor appointed by China will not be respected by Tibetans:According to Tibetan Buddhist tradition, the Dalai Lama is reincarnated, and his successor is identified by senior monks through visions, signs, and tests. Historically, this process has been free from political interference. However, China insists that it has the final say, citing historical conventions:– Mao Ning, Chinese foreign ministry spokespersonIn, the Dalai Lama explains that his successor must be free from Chinese control to continue his spiritual and humanitarian mission:This move is intended to prevent China from appointing a successor who would serve its political interests rather than uphold the spiritual and cultural values of Tibetan Buddhism.Beijing has dismissed the Dalai Lama’s remarks, insisting that it alone has the authority to choose his successor. The Chinese Foreign Ministry called him:They also reiterated that the reincarnation must follow government regulations:The controversy over the Panchen Lama—a senior figure in Tibetan Buddhism—illustrates China’s approach to religious succession. In 1995, the Dalai Lama identified a six-year-old boy, Gedhun Choekyi Nyima, as the 11th Panchen Lama. Shortly after, the Chinese government abducted the child and appointed its own Panchen Lama, Gyaltsen Norbu, who is seen by many Tibetans as illegitimate.The original Panchen Lama has not been seen since, with China claiming that he is now living a ""normal life."" This fuels fears that Beijing will follow the same strategy with the next Dalai Lama.If China installs a Dalai Lama of its choosing, Tibetans and the global Buddhist community are unlikely to accept him. This could lead to two rival Dalai Lamas—one recognized by Tibetans in exile and another by China. The Dalai Lama himself has warned:A divided leadership could deepen the Tibetan resistance against Chinese rule and further strain China’s relations with the international community.The dispute over the Dalai Lama’s succession has global implications, especially for China’s relations with India and the US.Beijing has condemned such foreign involvement as an attempt to destabilize China.In, the Dalai Lama expresses concern over Tibet’s fate under Chinese rule but remains hopeful:He also reaffirmed that the struggle for Tibetan freedom will continue beyond his lifetime:(With inputs from agencies)","Dalai Lama says his successor will be born in the ""free world""—outside of China.

UK plans to send failed asylum-seekers to Western Balkans,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-plans-to-send-failed-asylum-seekers-to-western-balkans/articleshow/119388791.cms,"Representative photo

LONDON: Failed asylum-seekers in UK, including those arriving from India, could be sent to migrant centres in Western Balkans and other third countries as part of PM Keir Starmer’s plan to deter small-boat arrivals.The Starmer-led Labour govt is drawing up plans to open a series of “return hubs” in countries such as Albania, Serbia and Bosnia, where migrants would be sent after they had been rejected for asylum and had exhausted all appeals, govt sources said.Rejected asylum-seekers from countries deemed safe under UK law, such as India, could be temporarily detained in these hubs while arrangements were made to deport them to their home country. Failed asylum-seekers from countries deemed unsafe under UK law, such as Afghanistan, could also be removed to these hubs.In 2024, 36,816 people arrived in the UK on small boats. Of these, the 19th highest number, 292, came from India. In 2024 5,312 Indians claimed asylum in the UK, the sixth highest nationality to do so. Starmer has been emboldened after the EU last week announced member states could set up return hubs outside the EU to hold rejected asylum-seekers.The proposal differs from the Rwanda scheme, initiated under the previous govt of Tories, to send asylum-seekers who arrived illegally in Britain on one-way tickets to Rwanda for their claims to be processed. Labour cancelled this scheme in July 2024.Chris Philp, Tory MP and shadow home secretary, said: “The fact that Labour (govt) is now looking at offshore processing shows they were wrong to cancel Rwanda (scheme) before it even started and shows their attempts to ‘smash the gangs’ have failed.”Enver Solomon, chief executive of Refugee Council, told TOI that handcuffing people onto removal flights was “inhumane” and it was better to assist them to return with dignity.","PM Keir Starmer is drawing up plans to open a series of ‘return hubs’ in countries such as Albania, Serbia and Bosnia.

Britain government orders probe over Heathrow power failure chaos,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/britain-government-orders-probe-over-heathrow-power-failure-chaos/articleshow/119372680.cms,"Tens of thousands of travellers affected

Broader concerns over Britain's infrastructure

'A clear planning failure'

British government launched an urgent investigation into the country’s energy resilience after an electrical substation fire forced Heathrow Airport to shut down for nearly a day. The disruption, which left thousands of passengers stranded, raised serious concerns about the UK's ability to withstand disasters or attacks on critical infrastructure.While Heathrow has since resumed full operations, airlines have warned that the impact will be felt for days as they work to relocate planes, reposition crew, and get travellers to their destinations. The scale of the disruption has prompted frustrated passengers, airlines, and politicians to demand answers.“This is a huge embarrassment for Heathrow airport. It's a huge embarrassment for the country that a fire in one electricity substation can have such a devastating effect,” said Toby Harris, chair of the national preparedness commission, quoted by news agency AP.Energy secretary Ed Miliband has tasked the national energy system operator with investigating the incident to determine whether there are wider lessons to be learned about the resilience of critical infrastructure. The initial findings are expected within six weeks.“The government is determined to do everything it can to prevent a repeat of what happened at Heathrow,” Miliband said.In addition, Heathrow has commissioned its own review, led by former transport secretary Ruth Kelly, who sits on the airport’s board. Heathrow chairman Paul Deighton said the review would assess “the robustness and execution of Heathrow’s crisis management plans, the airport’s response during the incident, and how the airport recovered.”More than 1,300 flights were cancelled, and an estimated 200,000 passengers were stranded on Friday after a fire broke out at a substation 3.2 km from the airport. The blaze also left more than 60,000 properties without power.On Saturday, Heathrow added extra flights to accommodate an additional 10,000 passengers, while British Airways, the airport’s largest airline, managed to operate about 85% of its 600 scheduled flights.Despite this, many travellers remained in limbo.Witnesses in west London reported hearing a loud explosion followed by a fireball and clouds of smoke as the substation went up in flames. Firefighters battled the blaze for seven hours before bringing it under control. The airport remained closed for nearly 18 hours, with only a few flights operating late on Friday.While police have ruled out foul play, the London Fire Brigade’s investigation is now focused on the substation’s electrical distribution equipment.The incident has reignited concerns about the fragility of Britain’s infrastructure, much of which has been privatised since the 1980s. The Labour government has pledged to improve the UK’s ageing transport and energy networks, with a focus on reducing delays, cutting emissions, and boosting energy security through investment in renewables.Toby Harris highlighted the need for better resilience planning.“ We've moved towards a sort of just in time' economy. There is an element where you have to make sure you're available for just in case.' You have to plan for things going wrong,” he said.As one of the world’s busiest airports, Heathrow handled 83.9 million passengers last year. Its CEO, Thomas Woldbye, defended the airport’s response, insisting that staff had done a “fantastic job” under the circumstances.“The airport didn’t shut for days. We shut for hours,” he told the BBC.He explained that Heathrow’s emergency power systems functioned as expected but were not designed to run the entire airport, which consumes as much electricity as a small city.“That’s how most airports operate,” Woldbye said. “The same would happen elsewhere in similar circumstances.”However, Willie Walsh, head of the International Air Transport Association (IATA), called the situation “unacceptable.”“How is it that critical infrastructure – of national and global importance – is totally dependent on a single power source without an alternative? If that is the case, as it seems, then it is a clear planning failure by the airport,” he said.Walsh also criticised Heathrow for failing to bear the financial burden of the disruption, arguing that airlines, not the airport, were forced to cover costs for stranded passengers.","More than 1,300 flights were cancelled, and an estimated 200,000 passengers were stranded on Friday after a fire broke out at a substation 3.2 km from the airport.

The price of Brexit: How much is leaving the EU costing UK businesses?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/the-price-of-brexit-how-much-is-leaving-the-eu-costing-uk-businesses/articleshow/119370348.cms,"Representative image

The UK is paying a heavy financial price for Brexit, with new data revealing a significant blow to trade with the European Union . As a result, the government has announced plans to eliminate obstacles hampering trade in an effort to mitigate the economic damage.As per recent figures—official estimates show that Brexit is costing UK businesses £37 billion annually due to reduced trade with the EU, according to report by UK newspaper Independent. According to data presented by UK trade minister Douglas Alexander, UK-EU trade for the period ending September last year was 5 per cent lower than in 2018, when adjusted for inflation and excluding precious metals. This figure comes from calculations by the House of Commons library.Alexander put the blame on the previous Conservative government's Brexit agreement for the substantial losses, declaring that it is ""clear [the agreement] is not working well enough."" He outlined the Labour government's commitment to rebuilding economic ties with the EU and removing unnecessary trade barriers to stimulate growth.The financial loss was highlighted during a parliamentary question from SNP MP Stephen Gethins, who described it as ""an appalling loss of trade at a time when business and the Exchequer can ill afford it."" Gethins criticized the government's ongoing adherence to a ""hard Tory Brexit,"" arguing that it worsens economic conditions while imposing cuts that harm the most vulnerable. ""A hard Brexit makes us poorer and less secure,"" Gethins warned. ""The government must stop punching down on the most vulnerable to balance the books and join the customs union and single market at the very least.""The burden of post-Brexit bureaucracy has also been substantial. The Independent recently reported that Brexit-related paperwork is so extensive it could circle the globe 15 times. David Henig, from the European Centre for International Political Economy, directly linked the trade decline to Brexit and urged the government to address regulatory differences that are causing friction.Mike Galsworthy of European Movement UK questioned the rationale for excluding the single market, customs union, and free movement, arguing these were not mandated by the 2016 referendum. Meanwhile, Tom Brufatto from Best for Britain suggested that closer alignment with the EU could increase the UK economy by 2.2 per cent, and called for policies to reduce trade friction ahead of the upcoming UK-EU summit in May.","UK-EU trade for the period ending September last year was 5 per cent lower than in 2018, when adjusted for inflation and excluding precious metals.

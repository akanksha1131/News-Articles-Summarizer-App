Widespread impact on energy systems



Russian tactics



Biden's reaction



Russia advances on the ground



Russia unleashed a massive wave of missiles and drone strikes across Ukraine on Thursday, targeting critical power plants and plunging millions into darkness as temperatures hovered around freezing. Ukrainian officials reported major damage in nine regions, with over a million people immediately losing power and many more facing intensified rolling blackouts.Russian President Vladimir Putin said the assault was in retaliation for Ukraine's use of US-supplied ATACMS missiles to strike Russian territory. He warned that future targets could include strikes by hypersonic missiles on ""decision-making centers"" in Kyiv.The attack, one of the largest since March, involved 91 missiles and 97 drones, according to Ukraine’s air force. While Ukrainian defenses intercepted 79 missiles and 35 drones, 12 missiles struck their targets, primarily energy and fuel facilities.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy denounced the strikes as a ""despicable escalation,"" accusing Russia of using cruise missiles equipped with cluster munitions. He urged Western allies to strengthen their support, speaking with Nato secretary general Mark Rutte, British PM Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to coordinate a response.""Now is the time to strengthen our positions — the position of Ukraine and our partners,"" Zelenskyy said in his nightly address.The strikes severely disrupted Ukraine’s already strained energy grid, which has suffered 11 major attacks since March. Ukrenergo, the state grid operator, imposed deep power cuts, warning some areas could face 12-hour outages.In western Ukraine, electricity was cut to over 500,000 people in Lviv, with similar outages affecting the Volyn and Rivne regions. Authorities relied on generators to supply heat and water to critical facilities such as hospitals and schools.Ukraine disconnected its nuclear power plants from the grid before the attack as a precaution, a source in the energy sector said. The country relies on nuclear energy for over half of its electricity supply.Naftogaz, Ukraine’s largest state oil and gas firm, confirmed its facilities were targeted during the strikes.The Ukrainian air force reported that Russia employed advanced tactics to outmaneuver defences, including thermal and radar decoys, electronic warfare devices, and foggy weather conditions that hampered visibility.""Western systems work much more effectively in such conditions, but Ukraine does not have enough to reliably cover hundreds of critical infrastructure facilities,"" the Ukrainian air force said.The strikes by Russia drew condemnation from the United States President Joe Biden, who called it “outrageous” and pointed out the urgency of supporting Ukraine.Ukraine’s foreign minister Andrii Sybiha reiterated calls for more air defence systems and long-range capabilities from Western allies, saying, ""Putin does not want peace. We must force him into peace through strength.""Meanwhile, Russian ground forces are reportedly advancing at their fastest pace in two years, with Moscow deploying a hypersonic intermediate-range ballistic missile earlier this month.","Russian President Vladimir Putin said the assault was in retaliation for Ukraine's use of US-supplied ATACMS missiles to strike Russian territory.

Transition of power



US President Joe Biden has called on President-elect Donald Trump to reconsider his proposed tariffs on Canadian, Mexican, and Chinese goods, calling them “counterproductive” as the transition of power moves forward from the Democrats to the Republicans.“I hope he rethinks it. I think it’s a counterproductive thing to do,” Biden told reporters on Thursday in Nantucket, Massachusetts, while on holiday, saying things could become the opposite of the desired goal. He stressed the importance of maintaining strong ties with neighbouring allies, saying, “We’re surrounded by the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, and two allies, Mexico and Canada. The last thing we need to do is begin to screw up those relationships,” he continued.Trump recently announced plans to impose tariffs to pressure Canada and Mexico to improve border security , address immigration issues, and combat drug smuggling and fentanyl exports. In a post on Truth Social, the President-elect proposed 25 per cent tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods, alongside a 10 per cent tariff on Chinese imports.“Both Mexico and Canada have the absolute right and power to easily solve this long simmering problem,” Trump wrote. “Until such time that they do, it is time for them to pay a very big price!,"" he concluded.Responses from neighboursMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has pushed back strongly against the proposed tariffs, warning of potential countermeasures. “One tariff would be followed by another in response, and so on until we put at risk common businesses,” she said.Despite Trump’s assertion that a recent phone call with Sheinbaum had been “very productive,” the Mexican leader clarified she had not agreed to close the border as Trump claimed. “In our conversation with President Trump, I explained to him the comprehensive strategy that Mexico has followed to address the migration phenomenon, respecting human rights,” she posted on X. She further said that a trade war could be avoided.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau voiced concerns but said that his conversation with Trump was a “good call.” He pointed out that Canada’s measures to address border challenges were different from Mexico's.On Thanksgiving, Biden expressed gratitude for the smooth transition to the incoming administration, saying, “I want to make sure it goes smoothly.” While urging Trump to reconsider the tariff threats , he also discussed foreign policy, including a cease-fire deal between Israel and Lebanon and the release of three Americans from Chinese detention.Regarding Trump’s 10 per cent tariff threat to China, Biden said, Chinese President Xi Jinping ""doesn't want to make a mistake.""“I am not saying he is our best buddy, but he understands what’s at stake,"" he added.Biden noted that illegal border crossings had significantly decreased since Trump’s first term, despite the former president’s continued campaign focus on the issue.","US President Joe Biden has called on President-elect Donald Trump to reconsider his proposed tariffs on Canadian, Mexican, and Chinese goods.

Are Harry and Meghan heading for a divorce?

As Meghan Markle has professionally separated from her husband Prince Harry intensifying rumors about their divorce, the Duchess of Sussex has asked the US authorities to give her some more time to get her lifestyle brand off the ground. Meghan will now fully focus on her career but her jam brand American Riviera Orchard could not procure a trademark because of some issues with the filing. Meghan was given three months to address the errors in the application in August. According to reports, she has now asked for another three months to correct the error in the filing and if this deadline is missed, she will have to start the application again. The application which Meghan filled early this year was not signed and she didn't send enough money, reports said.There is another firm that has the trademark Royal Riviera which challenged Meghan's trademark plea.However, it is not clear why Meghan would need three more months to set things right when her lawyers have been already working on it.Harry and Meghan are in the middle of a professional separation which means they will not work together. According to their aides, this is a decision they have jointly arrived as their joint brand 'Harry-Meghan' or the 'Sussexes' has been losing popularity. It has been decided that Meghan will be focusing on her Hollywood projects and home goods brand while Harry will be doping his charity works. But whether this arrangement is to cover up their personal separation as well is not yet known. They have rarely made joint appearances and according to reports, they are rarely together in California either.Before marrying Harry, Meghan was married to American film producer Trevor Engelson from 2011 to 2014 when they divorced. They cited ""irreconcilable differences"" for their divorce.

Blasphemy Debate: Why UK PM Keir Starmer is under fire,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/blasphemy-debate-why-uk-pm-keir-starmer-is-under-fire/articleshow/115772357.cms,"The Call for Blasphemy Protections



Criticism of Sir Keir Starmer’s Response



Historical Context: The Repeal of Blasphemy Laws



The Risks of Restricting Free Speech



Blasphemy Laws Around the World



A Warning for the Future



The Broader Implications



Christopher Hitchens once warned: “Resist it while you still can, and before the right to complain is taken away from you. The next thing you will be told is that you can’t complain because you’re Islamophobic.” His words, delivered with characteristic urgency, resonate eerily today as Labour MP Tahir Ali ’s call for laws to protect religious texts and figures sparks fresh debates about freedom of expression in the UK.Caught in the crossfire is Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer , whose cautious response to the controversy has drawn ire from critics on all sides. In a political moment that demands clarity and conviction, Starmer’s apparent hesitancy to defend free speech has left many questioning his leadership—and the Labour Party ’s commitment to democratic principles.Ali has stirred controversy by suggesting the introduction of new laws to prohibit the desecration of religious texts and figures associated with the Abrahamic faiths . During a parliamentary session, Ali posed a question to Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, asking if the government would consider such measures. This proposal has ignited a debate about the implications for free speech, religious tolerance, and societal cohesion.Ali’s request reflects concerns from some religious communities about the growing instances of perceived disrespect toward sacred beliefs. However, critics argue that such a proposal resembles the now-defunct blasphemy laws that were abolished in the UK in 2008. These laws historically protected Christian doctrines and criminalised dissenting opinions, often at the expense of free expression.The MP’s focus on Abrahamic religions—Islam,Christianity , and Judaism—has raised questions about inclusivity. Observers have pointed out that singling out these faiths could marginalise other religious or secular communities, creating a hierarchy of protections. British Hindus and Sikhs, for instance, might feel excluded, while atheists and free thinkers worry about a potential rollback of freedoms hard-won over centuries.Prime Minister Starmer’s response to Ali’s question—acknowledging the seriousness of desecration but framing it as part of broader efforts to combat hatred—has faced criticism for being non-committal. Many expected a stronger defence of free speech from Starmer, a former human rights lawyer, but his cautious remarks have left critics questioning Labour’s stance on protecting democratic values.Blasphemy laws in the UK date back to the medieval era and were initially designed to shield the Church of England from criticism. Over time, societal shifts and the growing value placed on free expression led to their repeal in 2008. The move was seen as a step forward in promoting a pluralistic society where individuals could challenge ideas without fear of legal repercussions.Ali’s proposal has reignited debates about whether revisiting such laws would undermine this progress. Critics emphasise that a revival could embolden extremism and stifle necessary dialogue in an increasingly diverse society.Across the world, modern blasphemy laws have often been used to suppress dissent. In countries like Pakistan, accusations of blasphemy have led to mob violence, wrongful imprisonments, and even executions. Critics of Ali’s proposal argue that importing similar restrictions into the UK risks enabling sectarian divisions and eroding civil liberties.Britain has already seen incidents of religious extremism linked to perceived blasphemy. A teacher remains in hiding after showing a depiction of the Prophet Muhammad in class, and a 14-year-old autistic boy faced death threats over accidentally dropping a Quran. In both cases, critics assert that the absence of blasphemy laws was vital in preventing further institutional persecution.Blasphemy laws exist in many countries worldwide, often criminalizing speech or actions perceived as disrespectful to religious beliefs. These laws are particularly prevalent in countries across the Middle East, South Asia, and Africa. Nations like Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Nigeria enforce strict blasphemy laws, sometimes imposing severe penalties, including imprisonment, fines, or even the death penalty. Critics argue that such laws are frequently misused to suppress dissent and target religious minorities, fostering discrimination and injustice. Meanwhile, several Western countries, including the UK, have abolished such laws, emphasizing freedom of speech and religion as fundamental rights in modern democracies.Prominent voices like the late Christopher Hitchens warned against the resurgence of blasphemy restrictions, cautioning that they could pave the way for broader curtailments of speech. Hitchens famously urged people to resist such moves, predicting that free expression could soon come under attack under the guise of combating hate.Ali’s proposal highlights broader tensions in modern British society. Balancing respect for religious beliefs with the need to protect freedom of expression is a complex challenge. However, many argue that safeguarding the latter is essential for fostering genuine dialogue and mutual understanding in a diverse democracy. The UK has long prided itself on upholding individual liberties, including the right to criticise or satirise religious and ideological ideas. Introducing laws that curb these freedoms risks setting a precedent that undermines these values and could embolden those seeking to impose more restrictive measures.",Labour MP Tahir Ali has stirred controversy by suggesting the introduction of new laws to prohibit the desecration of religious texts and figures associated with the Abrahamic faiths. Critics argue that such a proposal resembles the now- defunct blasphemy laws that were abolished in the UK in 2008. Critics emphasise that a revival could embolden extremism and stifle necessary dialogue in an increasingly diverse society.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115773064,imgsize-114404,width-400,resizemode-4/115773064.jpg"

In a separate incident in September, authorities charged an individual with attempted assassination after being found with a rifle at one of Trump’s golf properties in Florida.Putin, known for his own extensive security measures, expressed shock not only at these incidents but also at the criticism Trump’s family and children faced from political opponents during the US election campaign.He described such tactics as ""revolting"" and noted that even ""bandits"" in Russia would not employ such methods.Discussing the Biden administration's decision to permit Kyiv to target Russia with Western missiles, which Putin characterised as an escalation in Ukraine, he suggested this could either serve as an opportunity for Trump to reverse or potentially complicate his relationship with Russia.Nevertheless, Putin said that Trump would ""find the solution"" and affirmed Moscow's willingness to engage in dialogue.He also said that Russia would deploy its entire arsenal against Ukraine if the latter obtained nuclear capabilities.

US Vice President Kamala Harris after failing the presidential election , despite spending almost $2 billion for her campaign should prevent her from seeking future office, a Democratic megadonor said.The vice president's brief campaign exhausted the substantial sum within approximately 100 days, allocating significant portions towards advertising and celebrity-attended functions.While speaking on a Fox News Fox News' Kayleigh McEnany Wednesday, John Morgan said President-elect Donald Trump's youngest son, Barron Trump , is ""smarter"" than anyone in Kamala Harris's campaign team.""It turns out that Baron Trump, who looks like a runway model, was telling his father, you need to go on podcasts, you need to go on Joe Rogan...

He noted that supporters were more motivated by opposition to Trump than enthusiasm for Harris.A notable expenditure included $900,000 for Harris' image on the Las Vegas Sphere, despite ultimately losing Nevada. The campaign's total advertising costs reached $494 million.Morgan highlighted the substantial commissions and payments involved, suggesting numerous individuals profited significantly from anti-Trump donors.Despite acknowledging Harris' debate performance, Morgan criticised the overall campaign.

Nancy Pelosi — who’s viewed as the one behind Biden’s ouster from the ticket.“Obama did not want her. Obama did not endorse her for five days. Pelosi did not want her. Pelosi told her California delegation ‘there would be a conference, a caucus, there’d be a convention,'” New York quoted Morgan saying.Morgan ridiculed the Democrats’ game plan that ran on “democracy, democracy, democracy,” before the party ditched democracy and chose Harris despite no primary votes being cast for her.","US Vice President Kamala Harris should not be allowed to run for office, Democratic megadonor John Morgan said.

US Universities Advise Students to Return Before Trump’s Inauguration,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/return-before-trump-takes-office-us-universities-tell-students/articleshow/115784305.cms,"Representative photo

HYDERABAD: A number of universities in the US have asked foreign students, including Indians, to return from their winter break before Donald Trump's presidential inauguration on Jan 20. Advisories issued to the students say this is to avoid potential travel bans and increased scrutiny at entry points.Students said the university authorities were concerned over Trump's threat during the election campaign of carrying out the largest deportation of illegal migrants in US history. Although this is unlikely to affect Indian students with valid visas, it is best not to take chances, university administrations have said.The concerns have been raised when India has surpassed China in student enrolments in the US for the first time. Between 2023 and 2024, 3.3 lakh Indian students made it to US campuses compared to 2.7 lakh Chinese students.Some institutions have even adjusted their academic calendars to ensure students returned well before the inauguration. A postgraduate student of data science at Willamette University in Salem, Oregon, told TOI his classes typically begin a week after New Year. This time, however, the academic schedule starts on Jan 2.""Our professors said it would be risky to come after the first weekend of Jan, even though the inauguration is on Jan 20. The stress is palpable,"" the 24-year-old student said.Yale University even conducted a separate session to address students' doubts. ""This was only to avoid any potential issues at airports or in terms of flight bookings,"" a 22-year-old undergraduate student of microbial pathogenesis said.S Sarsan, a bachelor's student of economics at University of Massachusetts, shared he had originally booked his return tickets for Jan 10 but was forced to rework his plans. ""Tickets right after the winter break are expensive. I paid almost Rs 35,000 more. Our professors shared that there may be higher scrutiny in terms of security, and they might also thoroughly check our documents. To avoid any such issues, it was better to enter the US well before the inauguration,"" he added.University of Massachusetts' office of global affairs cited previous experiences with travel bans during Trump's first administration in 2016 as a reason for issuing the advisory. ""The advisory is being made out of an abundance of caution,"" the office stated on its website.Students from other universities, including University of Memphis and Wesleyan University, too reported receiving similar guidance.A professor from Wesleyan University told TOI on the condition of anonymity, ""Even though our students are legally in the US, we do not want to invite trouble for them or the university. We do not know what could happen. It only makes sense to avoid getting into any trouble.""Balaji K, provost of University of Memphis, addressed the anxiety among students about possible disruptions. ""Students are definitely overwhelmed because of the uncertainty. They are concerned about the sudden changes in immigration policies that Trump may bring in. Like changes to Optional Practical Training (OPT) programme, that allows students to work in the US after graduating. However, we are reassuring them that they have valid documentation and that the university will support them if issues arise,"" said Balaji.","US universities have asked foreign students, including Indians, to return from their winter break before Donald Trump's presidential inauguration on Jan 20.

ISLAMABAD: A well-known Pakistani journalist, Matiullah Jan, investigating civilian deaths in a recent assault launched by security forces against supporters of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan, has been booked in terrorism and narcotics cases in Islamabad on Thursday.Jan was picked up by unknown individuals along with another journalist, Saqib Bashir, late Wednesday night. His family said he was abducted from the parking of a hospital in Islamabad at around 11pm by “unmarked abductors in an unmarked vehicle”. Bashir, who was later released, said they were collecting data from the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) on the casualties after the march when they were taken.The incident took place amid rising tensions in the capital following Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party’s claims that more than 200 of its workers had been killed by security forces during a late Tuesday night operation to disperse Imran’s supporters in the capital. The protesters had gathered to demand the release from jail of Imran Khan and other politicians and workers of his party.On Thursday afternoon, Islamabad police booked Jan with charges related to terrorism, drug-peddling and attacking police. “It is no less than a joke. There is not an iota of truth in these charges,” his lawyer, Imaan Mazari, said.The Committee to Protect Journalists expressed grave alarm over Jan’s “abduction” and demanded on social media that the “authorities must ensure Jan’s safety and immediate release”.The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) also demanded Jan’s immediate release and condemned his arrest as part of an authoritarian tactic to silence journalists. “This authoritarian tactic to silence journalists must cease,” the HRCP asserted.","Journalist Matiullah Jan was investigating civilian deaths in a recent assault launched by security forces against supporters of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan.

(Reuters)

ISLAMABAD: At least eight supporters of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) were killed and dozens of others injured in Islamabad following what the party said was a sweeping crackdown overnight by security forces to disperse protesters demanding the release of jailed former prime minister and PTI chief Imran Khan Following the crackdown, Imran’s party ended its agitation but Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur addressed a press conference in his province on Wednesday saying the protest would go on. “Until Imran Khan’s call, this sit-in will go on,” he said without elaborating where it would be held. PTI has been in govt in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.Thousands of demonstrators, led by Imran’s wife Bushra Bibi, and Gandapur, had gathered in the capital on Tuesday vowing to stage a sit-in until their demands were met, including the release of political prisoners. Khan and many other PTI leaders and workers have been in jail for over a year on charges that they claim are politically motivated.Security forces launched a massive crackdown before midnight Tuesday after failing to stop protesters from marching to D-Chowk, a public square in Islamabad’s high-security red zone. In the evening authorities forced surrounding stores, cafes and markets to shut and then plunged the protest venue into darkness by switching off streetlights. Eyewitnesses said indiscriminate firing and teargas shelling, which started after 11pm and continued for about two hours, forced the PTI supporters, mostly Pashtuns from the northwest, to retreat.PTI claimed eight of its supporters had died in the late-night clashes and “hundreds” more were feared to have been killed. The govt stated three paramilitary troops and one policeman had died since the PTI launched its protest on Sunday. Islamabad’s police chief told media more than 900 people had been arrested in Tuesday’s raid, in which there were dozens of Afghan nationals.Sources at Islamabad’s two public hospitals said five civilians had died of gunshot wounds and dozens had been injured. According to PTI workers, they had picked up three bodies from the protest site.Information minister Attaullah Tarar said the protesters had fled in disarray, leaving behind vehicles, and even their shoes and clothes.PTI said in a post on social media that a “massacre has unfolded in Pakistan at the hands of security forces”. It accused the armed security forces of launching a violent assault on peaceful PTI protesters, firing live rounds with the intent to kill as many people as possible. It went on to compare last night’s clashes to the violence in the then East Pakistan in 1971. “The rulers have learned nothing from history and are prepared to destroy the country to cling to their illegitimate power,” the post stated. “With hundreds dead and countless injured, the interior minister’s threat to kill, and then the declaration of ‘victory’ over slaughtered innocents is enough evidence of the regime’s inhumanity,” it added.On Wednesday morning, the heavily fortified red zone was empty of protesters but dozens of smashed vehicles, including the charred remains of a truck from which Imran’s wife had been leading the protest, portrayed a grim picture.",At least eight supporters of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) were killed and dozens of others injured in Islamabad.

Bushra Bibi , the wife of former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan , is leading protests demanding his release from jail. At least five people have died in the resulting violence.Khan supporters, led by Bushra Bibi, marched in various locations, including D-Chowk in Islamabad. A planned rally on November 24 was prevented by an Islamabad High Court order citing the visit of Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko and a new public order law. Protests also occurred globally.Speaking to PTI workers, Bibi said, ""This is not just about my husband; it is about this country and its leader."" Addressing a rally, she added, ""Until Imran Khan is with us, we will not end this protest. I will remain here until my last breath, and I ask all of you to stand by us. This isn’t just about my husband. It’s about the future of our country and the leadership we deserve.""Khan was ousted in a no-trust motion in 2022 and has been imprisoned since. Bushra and Khan are now facing terrorism charges related to the November 24 protest. Bushra, who typically wears traditional Islamic attire covering her face, has become more politically active since Khan's imprisonment.Bushra Bibi, the wife of former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan, is facing several legal challenges, including a corruption case and a complaint filed by her ex-husband.Bibi, who married Khan in 2018, was recently released on bail after serving part of a 14-year sentence. She alleged attempts to poison her food while incarcerated. She and Khan were jailed and fined $2 million each in a corruption case related to state gifts. Khan and Bibi face approximately 200 legal cases following his removal from office.Bibi’s ex-husband, Khawar Maneka, is pursuing a case against her related to their divorce. Maneka, the son of a former minister, alleges a “fraudulent marriage.” His “fornication” claim was rejected. The case centers on whether Bibi observed the required waiting period before remarrying under Islamic law. Bibi and Maneka were married for 28 years and have five children.Bibi, approximately 50 years old, is known as a spiritual guide and faith healer. Khan has described her as a spiritual guide. Prior to marrying Khan, Bibi was married to Maneka and was known as Bushra Maneka. She is a follower of Sufism and a devotee of the Sufi mystic poet Baba Farid.Khan stated in 2018 that he did not see Bibi’s face until after their marriage. “In a rare, and till then the only TV interview in October 2018, she dismissed this as bunkum,” regarrumors that she had foreseen Khan’s prime ministership in a dream.","Imran Khan's wife, Bushra Bibi, is leading protests demanding his release from jail.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan deployed its army within the nation's capital on Tuesday with orders to shoot protesters if necessary, as deadly clashes escalated between the police and supporters of former PM Imran Khan.The govt said four paramilitary rangers and two policemen were killed late Monday and over 100 security personnel injured in the violence, as thousands of protesters marched to Islamabad to demand Khan's release from prison. PM Shehbaz Sharif blamed the protesters for the soldiers' deaths, accusing them of ramming the paramilitary troops with a convoy of vehicles. ""It is not a peaceful protest. It is extremism,"" he said in a statement, aimed at achieving ""evil political designs"".Zulfikar Bukhari, spokesman for Khan's party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), denied Sharif's accusation and claimed that two protesters had been killed and 30 more injured in the clashes, the worst political violence seen in months in the nation of 241 million people. One of the protesters was shot dead and the other was run over by a vehicle, Bukhari said. Authorities did not reply to a query seeking to confirm the deaths.Meanwhile, Amnesty International said the govt must fully protect the rights of protesters and rescind ""shoot-on-sight"" orders that it said gave undue and excessive powers to military.Khan's supporters dismantled roadblocks that had been put in place to stop them while patriotic songs blared from vehicles. Some danced in front of the slow-moving convoy, some chanting, ""Revolution! Revolution!"" When they reached the square late afternoon, some chanted ""Prisoner Number 804"" - a reference to Khan - while others climbed atop shipping containers that had been set up to block their advance.PTI workers, many of them brandishing slingshots and sticks, engaged security personnel in combat as they attempted to make way to D-Chowk, a central square in front of parliament located close to key govt buildings such as the presidency, the PM office, and the supreme court.

ISLAMABAD: Thousands of protesters demanding the release of former prime minister Imran Khan arrived at the heart of Pakistan’s heavily fortified capital, Islamabad, on Tuesday amid intense teargas shelling and use of rubber bullets by security forces, even as the govt invoked Article 245 of the constitution, which allows a civilian govt to call in the army to help it implement law and order.At least four security personnel and two civilians were killed in overnight clashes between security forces and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) supporters.

Sharif has condemned the violence, calling PTI an ""anarchist group"" responsible for chaos. Over 4,000 PTI supporters have been arrested, and shoot-at-sight orders have reportedly been issued to deter further violence.

What did the US say?

Govt tightens restrictions

Islamabad has become the centre of escalating unrest as thousands of supporters of jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan marched into Pakistan's capital, clashing violently with security forces. The protests, driven by the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, have led to six deaths, including four security personnel, and prompted the deployment of the Pakistan Army under Article 245 of the Constitution, with shoot-on-sight orders being issued, ARY news reported.Security forces have struggled to contain the protesters, who broke through barricades and flooded the Red Zone—a fortified area housing key government buildings. The demonstrations turned deadly when a vehicle in the convoy rammed into security personnel, killing four Rangers.To manage the situation, Islamabad's roads have been blocked with shipping containers, schools remain shut, and mobile internet services have been suspended. Tear gas and warning shots have been used to disperse crowds, but the PTI has vowed to press on until Khan is released. PTI leader Bushra Bibi has urged demonstrators to remain peaceful but resolute, saying, “The march will not end until Imran Khan is free.”The unrest stems from PTI’s demand for the immediate release of Imran Khan, who has been in prison since August 2023, convicted in multiple graft cases. PTI supporters argue the charges are politically motivated and claim the current government, led by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who they allege came to power through rigged elections.The United States has expressed concern over the deteriorating situation in Pakistan, urging restraint from all sides. US State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller stated, “We call on protesters to demonstrate peacefully and refrain from violence, and at the same time, we call on Pakistani authorities to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms.”The government has tightened restrictions, banning gatherings and limiting travel between cities. Travel between Islamabad and other cities has become nearly impossible due to shipping containers blocking roads, and all educational institutions have been closed. Mobile internet services and messaging platforms are experiencing significant disruptions in the capital.Police have arrested over 4,000 supporters of Khan since Friday and suspended mobile and internet services in certain areas of the country. On Thursday, a court issued a ban on rallies in the capital, with Naqvi stating that anyone who defied the order would be arrested.","Protests led by Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party have led to six deaths, including four security personnel.

He said, “If they again fire bullets, the bullet will be responded with the bullet.”Pakistani protesters rallying in the capital on Tuesday to demand the release of ex-Prime Minister Imran Khan killed four members of the nation's security forces, according to the government.Interior minister Mohsin Naqvi confirmed in a statement that the members of the paramilitary Rangers force were ""killed in the attack"" by protesters in central Islamabad.Pakistan's security forces fired tear gas and rubber bullets at thousands of protesters demanding the release of Khan, who defied a police lockdown to march into the capital.""We are deeply frustrated with the government, they do not know how to function,"" a protestor Kalat Khan told AFP on Monday, adding that the ""treatment we are receiving is unjust and cruel.""The US State Department expressed support for the Pakistani people's right to peacefully protest and urged Pakistani authorities to respect human rights and freedoms.""We call on protesters to demonstrate peacefully and refrain from violence and, at the same time, we call on Pakistani authorities to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms and to ensure respect for Pakistan's laws and constitution as they work to maintain law and order,"" state department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters.PTI leaders met with Imran Khan late on Monday night, where they reportedly presented the government’s proposals to the incarcerated party leader. The outcome of the meeting was unclear, as the PTI delegation left without addressing the media, Dawn reported.Earlier, sources suggested that PTI and government representatives had held talks to finalize a location for a protest in Islamabad that would not disrupt peace.

When Khan invoked Tipu Sultan to announce protests



What is Bushra Bibi's Saudi Arabia connection



With over hundreds of supporters of jailed ex-PM Imran Khan marching towards Islamabad, Pakistan is voicing its dissent against the current Shehbaz Sharif government demanding the release of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leader.The government is determined to suppress the protest with force, which was initially set for November 24. However, the convoys paused overnight after PTI leaders announced they were ""in no hurry"" to reach the federal capital for their high-stakes protest. Meanwhile, workers and supporters from across the country have been attempting to defy arrests, baton charges, and tear gas as they join the demonstration.The United States urged both Pakistani authorities and the thousands of protesters marching on the capital to exercise restraint in their actions.""We call on protesters to demonstrate peacefully and refrain from violence and, at the same time, we call on Pakistani authorities to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms and to ensure respect for Pakistan's laws and constitution as they work to maintain law and order,"" state department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters.The protests, so far, have seen the death of a cop, with several people being injured on both the sides. Internet and mobile services have been shut down as the government is adamant to suppress this “well-thought-out conspiracy.”Over 1,257 party workers have been detained, and nearly 200 arrested while attempting to march towards Islamabad in response to the party’s call for action, according to ARY news.In a rallying call to the nation, Imran Khan declared November 24 as the day to ""break free from slavery,"" emphasizing the suspension of the rule of law, the constitution, and human rights in the country.“November 24th is the day to break free from slavery. The rule of law, constitution, and human rights are suspended in Pakistan, forcing the nation to come out to protest and make sacrifices. The nation must decide whether to wear the yoke of slavery like Bahadur Shah Zafar or to adorn the crown of freedom like Tipu Sultan,"" he said in a post on X.The former prime minister has claimed that his imprisonment is part of a political strategy orchestrated by the military and the ruling government to prevent him from regaining power. Khan and his PTI party have also alleged widespread rigging in the February elections, where they assert they won the popular vote, and are now calling for free and fair elections.Multiple cases have been filed in Pakistan's Punjab province against Bushra Bibi, the wife of Imran Khan, religious hatred, misleading the public, and attacking the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia through her statements, which Khan claims was ""deliberately taken out of context.""At least four cases were registered under the Telegraph Act of 1885 and other legal provisions following a video statement in which, Bibi claimed that the problems faced by her husband began after his visit to Madina, where he was seen exiting his plane without shoes.“Soon after Khan’s return, former army chief Bajwa started getting calls Ye tum kya utha key ley aaye ho (whom have you brought)? We are ending the Sharia system in this country and you have brought promoters of Sharia,” she said in the video.Defying these accusations, Khan said, ""Bushra Bibi's statement was deliberately taken out of context to draw our brotherly country KSA into a needless controversy. She didn't mention Saudi Arabia at all.""The ruled and the ruler coming face to face is a deja vu for South Asia with Bangladesh recently witnessing the ousting of its serving PM Sheikh Hasina, who fled to India after massive violent protests marred the streets of Indian neighbour.","Hundreds of supporters of jailed ex-PM Imran Khan are marching towards Islamabad.

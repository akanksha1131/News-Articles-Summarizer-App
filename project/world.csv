The Trump administration is planning a major expansion of its travel ban, which could soon cover citizens from 36 additional countries. Earlier this month, the Republican president issued an order blocking citizens from 12 countries from entering the United States.According to an internal US State Department cable seen by Reuters and first reported by the Washington Post, these nations risk being added to the list unless they address specific security concerns within 60 days.The cable, signed by US secretary of state Marco Rubio, lists various issues that have triggered these concerns. Among them are countries failing to issue reliable identity documents, having weak or uncooperative governments, poor passport security, and refusing to accept their citizens who have been ordered to leave the United States.Some countries were also flagged for their citizens' involvement in terrorism, antisemitic activities, or anti-American actions. However, the cable noted that not every concern applied to all countries listed.During Trump’s first term, he had already introduced a controversial travel ban on several Muslim-majority nations, a policy that faced multiple legal challenges before being upheld by the US Supreme Court in 2018.The 36 countries now at risk of facing either full or partial bans include:This would add to the ban announced earlier this month, which already restricts travel from 12 nations such as Afghanistan, Myanmar, Iran, Libya, Somalia, and Yemen. There are also partial restrictions on travellers from countries like Venezuela, Cuba, Laos, and Sierra Leone.","The 36 countries now at risk of facing either full or partial bans include:This would add to the ban announced earlier this month.

Keep your doors locked and vehicles secured,"" warns the alert.The law enforcement has not revealed what type of vehicle they found. But they said they found a manifesto containing a list of names, including dozens of Minnesota lawmakers (such as Hortman, Senator John Hoffman, Governor Tim Walz, US Representative Ilhan Omar, U.S. Senator Tina Smith, and Attorney General Keith Ellison), abortion providers, and pro-abortion rights advocates.

"Pentagon dismisses 'pizza index' in connection with Israel's attack on Iran, says they have 'sushi, sandwiches, coffee'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/pentagon-dismisses-pizza-index-in-connection-with-israels-attack-on-iran-says-they-have-sushi-sandwiches-coffee/articleshow/121868270.cms,"Pentagon dismisses pizza index report of June 13 when Israel attacked Iran and said they don't need to order pizza from outside.

How are pizza orders linked to major geopolitical events







A Pentagon spokesperson reacted to the Pizza delivery index of June 13 when Israel launched military attacks in Iran and said they do not need to order pizza as there are many pizza options inside Pentagon and also they have sushi, sandwiches, donuts, etc. So, in a bizarre tracking, a surge in pizza orders around the Pentagon was noticed when the attack took place. ""Nearly all pizza establishments near the Pentagon have experienced a HUGE surge in activity,"" the X account of Pentagon Pizza Report said.The account's post included screenshots of Google data showing the popularity of pizza joints in Washington, D.C. Domino's, District Pizza Palace and We, the Pizza were all dramatically above what was typical for that time of the day.The Pentagon Pizza Report also said a gay bar close to the Pentagon had ""abnormally low traffic for a Thursday night"" as Israeli strikes were underway.The Pentagon Pizza Index, also known as the Pentagon Pizza Meter, is a quirky, unofficial theory suggesting that surges in pizza or takeout food orders to government buildings like the Pentagon, White House, or CIA can signal impending major geopolitical events or crises.The idea is that when government officials and staff work late into the night on urgent matters—such as military operations, coups, or international conflicts—they order quick, convenient food like pizza to sustain long hours in the office.The concept traces back to the Cold War, when Soviet intelligence reportedly monitored food delivery patterns to U.S. government buildings as a form of open-source intelligence (OSINT), dubbed “Pizzint” (Pizza Intelligence).According to The Guardian, deliveries of pizzas to the Pentagon doubled immediately before the 1989 US invasion of Panama and the 1991 Kuwait liberation campaign called Operation Desert Storm.The Takeout, a food and culture site, reported in January that while there are a number of eateries in the Pentagon—where almost 30,000 people work each day, according to Arlington National Cemetery Tours—it doesn't have its own pizzeria.Pentagon dismissed the spike reported this time and said they have plenty of pizza options inside and the timeline set out by the Pentagon Pizza Report did not align with the events, Newsweek reported.","Pentagon dismisses pizza index report of June 13 when Israel attacked Iran and said they don't need to order pizza from outside.

Netanyahu makes SHOCKING claim about Trump assassination attempts, his own





Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has claimed that Iran's Islamic regime sees US President Donald Trump as its biggest threat and even tried to assassinate him.Speaking to Fox News on Sunday, Netanyahu said, ""They want to kill him. He’s enemy number one.""Netanyahu also praised Trump for taking a tough stand against Iran's nuclear programme, rejecting previous agreements that allowed uranium enrichment and cancelling the nuclear deal. Netanyahu said Trump’s actions — including ordering the killing of Iranian general Qasem Soleimani — made him a key target for Tehran.""He took up this fake agreement and basically tore it up. He killed Qasem Soleimani. He made it very clear, including now, 'You cannot have a nuclear weapon, which means you cannot enrich uranium.' He's been very forceful, so for them, he's enemy number one,"" Fox News quoted Netanyahu as saying.The Israeli leader also revealed that his own life was targeted when a missile struck the bedroom window of his home. Calling himself Trump’s ""junior partner"" in confronting Iran, Netanyahu said both leaders have stood firm against Tehran's efforts to develop nuclear weapons.Describing the current situation, Netanyahu warned that Israel faced an ""imminent"" threat of nuclear destruction. He said Iran was moving fast to weaponise enriched uranium and expand its ballistic missile arsenal, producing thousands of missiles capable of striking Israeli cities. ""No country can sustain that, and certainly not a country the size of Israel, so we had to act,"" he said.Netanyahu defended Israel’s military campaign, Operation Rising Lion, calling it ""one of the greatest military operations in history."" He said the strikes have significantly set back Iran’s nuclear programme and dismissed the possibility of meaningful negotiations with Tehran.He also accused Iran's leaders of oppressing their people for 50 years while pursuing the destruction of Israel.","Netanyahu claims Iran's Islamic regime sees US President Donald Trump as its biggest threat and even tried to assassinate him.

The Middle East stands on the brink of wider conflict as Israel and Iran continued exchange of missile strikes early Monday, ignoring global calls for de-escalation.Israel’s most aggressive military campaign to date inside Iran has targeted key nuclear and energy sites, while Iran has responded with hundreds of missiles that breached Israeli defenses and caused mounting civilian casualties. The death toll has surged on both sides, with over 230 confirmed dead in Iran and at least 14 in Israel. Talks on Iran’s nuclear program with the US have been suspended, and both nations appear locked into a spiraling confrontation with regional and global repercussions.Israel's armed forces issued an alert on Monday about a fresh wave of missiles approaching from Iran, while AFP reporters documented powerful blasts in Jerusalem and fires near the coastal area of Haifa. ""A short while ago, the IDF identified missiles launched from Iran toward the territory of the State of Israel,"" the army posted on Telegram, using the acronym for its official name.The military stated that its aerial defence systems were actively working to counter the threat and instructed residents to seek shelter in protected areas until further instructions were provided.Powerful blasts echoed across Jerusalem in the early hours of Monday, as reported by an AFP journalist.The incident occurred moments after the Israeli military issued an alert about incoming missiles from Iran, instructing citizens to seek shelter and await further instructions.Iranian officials said Israeli airstrikes have killed 224 people and injured 1,277 since Friday, many of them civilians. Israel’s strikes hit the Iranian Defense Ministry, military factories, missile launch sites, and major energy facilities—including the South Pars gas field and the Shahran oil depot. Iranian state media reported massive fires and damage to residential buildings and government offices. The death toll is likely higher, with independent rights groups estimating over 400 killed.Iran launched a barrage of over 270 missiles at Israel, with 22 evading the country’s air defense systems. Strikes hit residential areas in Bat Yam, Tamra, and Rehovot, killing 14 and injuring nearly 390. A high-rise in Bat Yam was reduced to rubble, while an oil refinery in Haifa and the Weizmann Institute of Science also sustained damage. Air raid sirens rang out across Tel Aviv and Haifa as thousands rushed to shelters.Oil prices continued their upward trend on Monday as Israel and Iran exchanged missile strikes for the fourth consecutive day, with both nations threatening additional attacks, raising concerns about a prolonged conflict that could trigger inflationary pressures.The price of gold approached its historic peak due to increased demand for secure investments. Whilst equity markets experienced further declines, the losses remained contained due to optimism that the conflict would not expand across the Middle East region.Read: Missiles rained down as Israel & Iran tensions soared; what unfolded over the last 72 hours Investors focused on upcoming central bank meetings this week, particularly the US Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan sessions, alongside discussions with Washington regarding potential alternatives to Donald Trump's substantial tariffs.Israel's unexpected attack on Iranian military and nuclear facilities on Friday, which resulted in the deaths of senior commanders and scientists, caused crude prices to surge up to 13 percent, driven by concerns about regional supply disruptions.Experts cautioned that the price increase could trigger a global inflation resurgence, potentially undermining ongoing efforts by governments and central banks to maintain price stability, whilst raising concerns about impacts on already vulnerable economies. ""The knock-on impact of higher energy prices is that they will slow growth and cause headline inflation to rise,"" said Tony Sycamore, a market analyst at IG. Primary oil contracts increased by more than one percent during early Asian trading hours.A senior US official, quoted by AP, claimed that President Donald Trump intervened to stop an Israeli plan to assassinate Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The move, reportedly shelved due to fears of uncontrolled escalation, underscores how far Israel was prepared to go in its campaign against Iran’s leadership and nuclear infrastructure.Planned nuclear negotiations in Oman between the US and Iran were canceled after Israeli strikes on Iran’s Natanz and Isfahan nuclear sites. Satellite imagery and IAEA inspections confirmed major damage to key support buildings, including a uranium-conversion facility. While no radiation was released, officials said it could take months to restore operations. The attacks mark a major blow to Iran’s nuclear capacity and to diplomatic efforts.Panic spread in Tehran as Israeli missiles struck civilian districts and key infrastructure. Long queues formed at fuel stations and many attempted to flee the capital. In response, Iranian authorities began converting metro stations and mosques into shelters. Health officials reported that 90 per cent of the dead were civilians, while images of bloodied survivors and collapsed buildings circulated widely on state media.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu suggested that regime change in Iran could be a consequence of the conflict. He accused Tehran of seeking to transfer nuclear arms to Houthi rebels, though no evidence was offered. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi warned that Iranian retaliation would cease only if Israeli strikes stopped, signaling no immediate end to the hostilities.With Israel’s war against Hamas still ongoing in Gaza, the multi-front crisis risks plunging the entire region into chaos. Iran’s backing of Palestinian and Lebanese militant groups adds to fears of escalation beyond Israel and Iran. Despite international appeals for restraint, neither side has signaled willingness to step back, raising concerns that the conflict may soon draw in additional regional actors.Also read: 'Haven't slept in 3 days', fear grips Indian students in Iran; Israel escalates attack","Israel's armed forces issued an alert on Monday about a fresh wave of missiles approaching from Iran.

Israel and Iran launched fresh attacks on each other on Sunday, killing scores of civilians and raising fears of a wider conflict, and US President Trump said it could be ended easily while warning Tehran not to strike any US targets.In Israel, rescue teams combed through rubble of residential buildings destroyed by Iranian missiles, using sniffer dogs and heavy excavators to look for survivors after at least 10 people, including children, were killed, raising the two-day toll to 13. Sirens rang out across the country after 4 pm on Sunday in the first such daylight alert, and fresh explosions could be heard in Tel Aviv. Israel said since Friday 390 people have been wounded. Iran has fired over 270 missiles, 22 of which got through the country's sophisticated multi-tiered air defences, according to Israeli figures. Israel's main international airport and airspace remained closed for a third day.In Iran, images from the capital showed the night sky lit up by a huge blaze at a fuel depot after Israel began strikes against Iran's oil and gas sector, raising the stakes for the global economy and the functioning of the Iranian state.Iran said Israel struck two oil refineries, raising the prospect of a broader assault. The Israeli military, in a social media post, warned Iranians to evacuate arms factories, signalling a further widening of the campaign. Explosions shook Tehran around noon and again around 3.30 pm.Israeli strikes targeted Iran's defence ministry early Sunday after hitting air defences, military bases and sites associated with its nuclear programme. Israel claimed it attacked an Iranian refuelling aircraft in Mashhad in the NE, calling it the farthest strike the military had yet carried out. Iran did not immediately acknowledge any attack.Iran has not given a full death toll but Israeli strikes have likely killed at least 406 people and wounded another 654, according to a human rights group that has long tracked the country, Washington-based Human Rights Activists.Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi said if Israel's strikes on Iran stop, then ""our responses will also stop."" Iran's president, Masoud Pezeshkian, criticised the US for supporting Israel and said if Israel's ""hostile actions"" continue, ""the responses will be more decisive and severe,"" state TV reported.Trump warned Iran that the US could get involved if Iran hits any American targets. ""If we are attacked in any way, shape or form by Iran, the full strength and might of the US Armed Forces will come down on you at levels never seen before,"" he said in a message on Truth Social.

Israel Defence Forces (IDF) on Monday said that Iran had launched over 100 unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) towards Israel, all of which were intercepted.“Iran sent more than 100 UAVs at Israel. We intercepted them,” the IDF posted on social media platform X.The conflict remains multi-fronted. The IDF reported that Hamas had fired a projectile from southern Gaza, triggering sirens in southern Israel.Israeli TV reports suggest that the military is trying to disrupt a possible Iranian missile attack by targeting launch sites. Iranian media outlets showed footage of air defence systems active near Parchin, where further Israeli strikes are believed to have occurred.The IDF confirmed it had hit multiple weapon production sites in Tehran belonging to the Quds Force, the IRGC, and the Iranian military. Israeli citizens have been advised to stay near shelters as the military braces for possible missile attacks from Iran.The Israeli military said early Monday that it was striking surface-to-surface missile sites in Iran. ""The IDF is currently striking surface-to-surface missile sites in central Iran,"" Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Nadav Shoshani wrote on X.""We are operating against this threat in our skies and in Iranian skies.""In a significant long-range operation, Israeli Air Forces struck an Iranian refuelling aircraft at Mashhad Airport, about 2,300 kilometres from Israel. This is the longest-range strike since the beginning of what Israel calls “Operation Rising Lion”. The IDF stated that it is working to establish air superiority over Iranian airspace.Iran has confirmed that Israel struck its oil refineries, and an Israeli strike killed the intelligence chief of its Revolutionary Guards, Mohammed Kazemi, along with two other senior officers. The official IRNA news agency reported that “three intelligence generals, Mohammad Kazemi, Hassan Mohaghegh and Mohsen Bagheri, were assassinated and fell as martyrs,” quoting a statement from the Revolutionary Guards.Iran's health ministry said on Sunday that Israeli strikes over the past three days have killed 224 people and injured more than 1,200. ""After 65 hours of aggression by the Zionist regime, 1,277 people have been injured. 224 women, men and children have been martyred,"" ministry spokesman Hossein Kermanpour wrote on X.

""Path to Tehran open,"" says Netanyahu

Escalation after deadly exchange

Global concerns over widening conflict





Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday issued his strongest warning yet to Iran, vowing to strike ""every target of the ayatollah regime"" and declaring that Israeli forces had already dealt a ""real blow"" to Tehran's nuclear infrastructure in an escalating military confrontation between the two regional arch-rivals.""We will hit every site, every target of the ayatollah regime,"" Netanyahu said in a video address, as Israel's air force continued its unprecedented campaign against Iranian military and nuclear facilities for a second consecutive day.Claiming Israel had opened a ""path to Tehran,"" Netanyahu warned that Iranian leaders should expect Israeli fighter jets in the skies over the capital ""very soon.""His remarks came shortly after the Israeli military announced it had struck 40 key targets in Tehran overnight, including ballistic missile sites and advanced air defence systems. The strikes were part of a broader Israeli offensive launched on Friday, which reportedly hit more than 200 Iranian military and nuclear sites, killing several high-ranking commanders, nuclear scientists, and government officials.""What they have felt so far is nothing compared to what they will feel under the force of our arm in the coming days,"" Netanyahu warned, calling Iran's nuclear ambitions and missile arsenal a ""dual threat"" to the State of Israel.The conflict erupted into open warfare following Israel's Friday assault on Iranian soil, a dramatic escalation in their shadow war that had largely played out through proxies and covert operations until now.Iran's response was swift. It launched waves of drones and ballistic missiles at Israeli cities, including Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. The retaliatory attack killed three people, injured more than 70 others, and caused damage in multiple locations, according to Israeli authorities.Iran's state media reported 78 people killed and over 320 injured in the first wave of Israeli strikes.The intensifying military confrontation has sparked global alarm, with regional and international powers urging both sides to de-escalate. However, both Israel and Iran appear determined to press ahead with their campaigns.","Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vows to strike ""every target of the ayatollah regime"" Israeli military announced it had struck 40 key targets in Tehran overnight, including ballistic missile sites and advanced air defence systems.

Just a few years ago, cinema in Saudi Arabia didn’t exist, not publicly, not legally. Fast forward to 2025, and Gerard Butler is walking a red carpet in Riyadh, meeting fans, and watching animated dragons soar across the Kingdom Tower.The Scottish actor, known forand, was in the Saudi capital for the regional premiere of thetrilogy, which officially released in UAE cinemas on June 12, 2025. But this wasn’t just another stop on a global press tour.“I’d always wanted to come to Saudi Arabia,” Butler said in an exclusive video interview with. “It had always been this kind of land that was very mystical and mysterious, you know, and now I think that it’s being opened up to the world.”Saudi Arabia lifted its 35-year cinema ban in 2018. Since then, what was once a film-free zone has rapidly evolved into a serious player in global entertainment. The transformation is part of, a national reform plan led by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman , aimed at diversifying the country’s economy and reshaping its cultural identity.Butler had already witnessed this shift while filming, his 2023 action thriller, in the sandstone valleys of AlUla.“I loved my experience on. I loved AlUla. It was maybe my favourite location that I filmed on,” he said.But it wasn’t just the backdrop that left an impression. “I just found the people so incredibly hospitable and warm,” he added. “And a lot of young, talented filmmakers that were also on our set, these young students. I think it’s great that it’s opening up to the world.”Before 2018, Saudi film lovers had to leave the country to watch a movie. Now, the appetite is growing, and fast. Cinemas are packed, premieres are turning into city-wide events, and stars like Butler are taking notice.“I love that people are really into cinema here,” he said. “It’s new, it’s fresh, it’s exciting. I kind of wish we still had that more around the rest of the world, because that’s the way it should be. Going to see a movie with a crowd of people on the big screen, you can’t beat that.”The Riyadh premiere of, held at Roshn Front Cinemas, was a spectacle. Fans lined the red carpet. The Kingdom Tower lit up with animated dragons. For a country that once had no theatres, it was a statement.At the heart of theseries is Stoick the Vast, a towering Viking chieftain and father figure voiced by Butler. It’s a role he’s played for over a decade, and one he feels personally connected to.“There’s a lot of my personality in Stoick,” he said. “I think the part of me that wasn’t in Stoick was probably in my beard. So maybe not so much me, because the beard, to me, is the bit that made him more like a granddad. You know, kind of brought him up even another generation.”Butler doesn’t see Stoick as just a cartoon character. When he steps into the costume, even for voice work, it changes something.“When I put on that costume, I became the chieftain of Berk,” he said. “That helmet, and the weight of that costume, and the size of it, it was both challenging. But to fit into it, you needed that power. And that power I grew to feel and understand and enjoy.”What makes Stoick memorable, Butler believes, is that blend of strength and vulnerability.“It felt great to be able to play a character that is so big and bombastic,” he said, “but also to let people into his heart and his soul and his grief and his pain and his joy.”“And yet not abandon the bigness, the goofiness, the fear, the offishness. He’s imposing. He’s powerful. But I always tried to bring in as many colours as I could. I never wanted it to feel like a generalised animated take.”There’s a reasonhas lasted this long, with fans ranging from kids to adults. It speaks to something deeper.“We’re maybe a different generation, I don’t know,” Butler said. “But when I grew up, I feel like there were some pretty deep, intense movies grappling with very challenging topics. And then I think it kind of disappeared. But I definitely think it’s coming back.”, he said, doesn’t shy away from those themes.“I think that’s what’s surprising and grown-up about. It works for, it’s eight to 80, as we say. Because I think it has the kind of complexity of those really interesting themes. And yet you can also just let go and be charmed and amazed and involved with the beauty and the fun of the journey.”","Gerard Butler attended the How to Train Your Dragon premiere in Riyadh on June 12, 2025, as part of his global tour.

Trying to shake the regime







""The time has come for the Iranian people to unite around its flag and its historic legacy, by standing up for your freedom from the evil and oppressive regime,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Friday in a video statement after Israel struck over 200 military and nuclear sites in Iran.The unannounced strikes were clearly meant to disrupt Tehran's nuclear work and increase the time it would take for Iran to produce a nuclear weapon.However, the number of sites hit, the specific nature of the targets, and remarks from Israeli leaders suggest there may be a wider aim: weakening or even removing Iran’s ruling regime.""As we achieve our objective, we are also clearing the path for you to achieve your freedom,"" Netanyahu said, referring to Israeli strikes that hit targets across Iran, including nuclear sites, killing several top military commanders and nuclear scientists.The attacks early Friday went beyond nuclear plants and missile sites. They also targeted senior members of Iran’s military and nuclear experts — moves that, according to a Reuters report, seem designed to damage Iran’s image internally and among its partners in the region. These are actions that could affect the stability of Iran’s leadership.There is already significant dissatisfaction among many people in Iran due to economic struggles, lack of free expression, and ongoing issues related to women’s and minority rights.In this situation, Netanyahu may be hoping that the extensive airstrikes will lead to unrest within the country that could eventually bring down the Islamic Republic.Some officials in Israel and the United States see the nuclear programme as the main security concern. From that view, Iran should be offered incentives: if it stops pursuing nuclear weapons and ends its support for armed groups, it could have sanctions removed and be reintegrated into the global system.Others believe the real issue is the continued existence of the Islamic Republic. They argue that Iran’s leadership is unlikely to change its regional behaviour and is working not to deter Israel, but to destroy it. From this perspective, diplomatic talks only help Iran buy time. A nuclear programme seen as illegal gives cover to maintain sanctions, which they hope will eventually weaken a regime they consider beyond repair.There is no common ground between these two positions. And now, more clearly than before, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appears to be in the second group. The recent strikes were not mainly focused on nuclear equipment but on top military commanders of the Islamic Republic. The goal, it seems, is not just to set back Iran’s nuclear efforts — but to challenge the regime’s hold on power, Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, wrote in an article in Foreign Policy.Israel might believe that the recent attacks and killings could destabilize the Iranian government and create an opportunity for a public uprising.This is what Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is hoping for. But this approach is risky.Even with the damage caused by Israel’s recent attack, there is long-standing hostility toward Israel — not just from Iran’s leadership but also from much of its mostly Shi’ite population. That makes it uncertain whether public anger alone could bring down a well-established religious government that has the support of strong security forces.There is no sign that such a series of events will even begin. And even if it does, there’s no clarity on what direction it would take, a BBC report said.Power in Iran lies mostly with those who control the military and the economy. Much of this power rests with hardliners in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and other unelected groups.These groups don’t need to carry out a coup — they already have authority. And they could choose to make Iran more confrontational in response to attacks.Another possible result could be the collapse of the current government, followed by instability in Iran.With a population of nearly 90 million, any unrest in Iran would affect many countries in the Middle East.If Israel is able to remove the Islamic leadership in Tehran, the attack would be seen as successful. But if the leadership stays in place — and history suggests that airstrikes alone rarely bring regime change — then Iran could still keep some part of its nuclear program, Jeffrey Lewis writes.Israel’s national security advisor has already said that Iran might still keep parts of its nuclear capability. So what happens then?One possibility Israel sees is that Iran could agree to a deal with US President Donald Trump to give up its nuclear plans. But another possibility is that Iran could follow North Korea’s path — leaving the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and eventually developing nuclear weapons. In that case, it is unlikely that Russia or China would support new sanctions. They may not even enforce the ones already in place. Russia has been buying Iranian drones, and China imports Iranian oil.The reasons why Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei stopped the country’s nuclear weapons program in 2003 — and why he kept that policy — are not fully known. There have been different views within Iran: some have wanted a nuclear weapon, while others have not. Until now, those opposing the bomb have been able to influence policy. But after this recent strike, these discussions will likely change. There will also be new individuals involved in these decisions. People will think about those who are no longer there and ask whether Israel would have acted this way if Iran already had nuclear weapons — or if Israel didn’t have them.If the Iranian government doesn’t fall, Israel might feel the need to carry out more attacks in the future. Even if this strike has seriously disrupted Iran’s nuclear efforts, Iran could restart the program.""In the ideal world, Israel would prefer to see a change of regime, no question about that,"" Sima Shine, a former chief Mossad analyst and now a researcher at Israel's Institute for National Security Studies, was quoted as saying by the news agency Reuters.If Israel succeeds in removing Iran's leadership, there is no guarantee the successor that emerges would not be even more hardline in pursuit of conflict with Israel.""For years, many in Israel have insisted that regime change in Iran would prompt a new and better day - that nothing could be worse than the current theocratic regime,"" Jonathan Panikoff, a former US deputy national intelligence officer for the Middle East was quoted as saying by Reuters. ""But history tells us it can always be worse.""","Israel may be hoping that the extensive airstrikes will lead to unrest within the country that could eventually bring down the Islamic Republic. The goal, it seems, is not just to set back Iran’s nuclear efforts — but to challenge the regime's hold on power. Some officials in Israel and the United States see the nuclear programme as the main security concern.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121850713,imgsize-1199755,width-400,resizemode-4/121850713.jpg"

Addressing the Global Need for Rapid Testing



A Versatile Diagnostic Tool



Simple, Cost-Effective, and Portable



From Concept to Commercialization







A breakthrough in infectious disease testing is set to revolutionize the way healthcare is approached in low-resource and remote settings. A team of scientists at New York University Abu Dhabi (NYUAD) has unveiled a paper-based diagnostic tool, the Radially Compartmentalised Paper Chip (RCP-Chip), capable of detecting diseases in under 10 minutes. This innovation is a game-changer for fast, affordable, and portable disease screening without the need for complex lab equipment or trained personnel.The RCP-Chip was conceived during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, when the world was grappling with a shortage of efficient testing methods, particularly in areas with limited resources. ""Our goal was to create something fast, affordable, and easy to use, especially in areas where lab access is limited,"" said Mohammad A. Qasaimeh, Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering and Bioengineering at NYUAD. Qasaimeh is the senior author of the study that led to the development of the RCP-Chip.The new tool offers a simple and rapid solution for detecting infectious diseases. ""It uses a minimal number of reagents and requires only a small sample to run,"" Qasaimeh added, emphasizing the affordability and efficiency of the device. This paper-based diagnostic chip can be deployed easily in diverse settings, from remote villages to urban areas, and can significantly improve healthcare access.While the RCP-Chip was originally designed to detect COVID-19, its capabilities extend far beyond the novel coronavirus. According to Qasaimeh, the device is easily reconfigurable to diagnose other diseases such as chickenpox, dengue, malaria, and more. ""With minor modifications, it can be adapted to diagnose a wide range of diseases or even test hormones and metabolites,"" Qasaimeh explained. This flexibility positions the RCP-Chip as a multi-purpose diagnostic tool that could be used in various medical fields, from general infectious disease testing to monitoring chronic health conditions.""What makes it truly impactful is its real-world potential,"" said Pavithra Sukumar, a Research Assistant at NYUAD and the co-first author of the study. Sukumar highlighted the tool's capacity to significantly improve outbreak responses, enabling faster isolation, treatment, and control. In situations where time is of the essence, such as in epidemic or pandemic scenarios, the rapid testing offered by the RCP-Chip can help curb the spread of diseases before they become uncontrollable.One of the standout features of the RCP-Chip is its portability. Unlike traditional diagnostic devices that require sophisticated lab setups, the chip can be operated with minimal resources. ""It requires a heating stage at around 60 degrees Celsius, which can be easily achieved with common household devices like a hot plate or an oven,"" Qasaimeh explained. The simplicity of the design allows for easy transport and deployment, ensuring that healthcare workers in areas with limited infrastructure can use it effectively.Moreover, the RCP-Chip uses saliva samples instead of traditional swabs, making it even more convenient and comfortable for patients. ""In a short amount of time, you can deploy it for use in almost any area,"" Qasaimeh said. This feature was a key motivation behind the development of the tool, aiming to reduce the time and cost typically associated with traditional diagnostic methods.The development of the RCP-Chip was not without its challenges. Due to pandemic-related lab access restrictions, the team faced delays during the initial stages of research. ""In the initial phase, we focused on designing the chip and brainstorming the approaches,"" said Qasaimeh. It wasn’t until restrictions were eased that the team was able to conduct in-depth testing of the device. ""After initial curfews, gradually we were allowed access to labs, and that’s when we deepened the research and began testing the device,"" he explained.Despite these challenges, the team successfully filed a patent for the device and launched a startup to commercialize it. Biotech companies have already expressed interest in the innovation. ""We aim to find investors so that we can continue with the development stage of the device,"" Qasaimeh added. The focus now is on bringing the device to market and further developing its translational potential, ensuring that it can be adapted for various purposes in the healthcare sector.With the growing demand for affordable and effective diagnostic tools, the RCP-Chip is poised to play a pivotal role in global healthcare. Its low cost, speed, and versatility make it an ideal solution for resource-limited settings, providing a much-needed alternative to current testing methods.","Radially Compartmentalised Paper Chip (RCP-Chip) can detect diseases in under 10 minutes.

Israel’s military claimed on Saturday that its strikes on Iran had killed over 20 military officials, including the Iranian army and Revolutionary Guards commanders. Among the dead, Israel alleged, is Mohammad Bagheri, the armed forces chief.""Since the beginning of the operation (on Friday), over 20 commanders in the Iranian regime's security apparatus have been eliminated,"" the Israeli military said in a statement, listing multiple senior figures from the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and the military, AFP quoted.Meanwhile, Iranian state media confirmed that two members of the IRGC were killed in the drone strike by Israel drone strike on the Zarandiyeh Basij base in central Iran. Tasnim news agency, cited the guards, ""Following the brutal attack by the Zionist regime on the Zarandiyeh Basij base, two members of Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps were martyred.""""This morning police chief major Habibollah Akbarian, along with second lieutenant Amir Hossein Seifi, were martyred by a drone strike in Asadabad city in the western province of Hamedan,"" the ISNA press agency reported.In Israel, Croatia's consul and his wife sustained minor injuries after their residential building in Tel Aviv was hit during Iran's missile strikes.“I am shaken by the news that our consul and his wife were injured in the attack on Tel Aviv. The building they live in was hit,"" Croatia's foreign minister said on X.Tensions between the two countries have sharply escalated following Israel’s ""Operation Rising Lion"", which began late Thursday.Israeli forces used warplanes and drones to target military and nuclear sites across Iran in what officials have called the country's most extensive military operation to date. As per Iranian authorities, the strike left 78 dead and over 300 injured.In response, Iran launched a barrage of ballistic missiles at Israeli cities late Friday and into early Saturday. Loud explosions were heard across Tel Aviv and Jerusalem as air raid sirens wailed. Residents were urged to take cover, while Iran’s military warned ominously that “everyone will feel it.”The latest strikes followed a fiery pledge from Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who vowed retaliation for what he called Israel’s “aggression.” His comments came just hours before Iranian missiles lit up the night skies, signalling a dangerous new phase in the already volatile conflict.","Israel claims to have killed over 20 military officials, including the Iranian army and Revolutionary Guards commanders. Among the dead, Israel alleged, is Mohammad Bagheri, the armed forces chief.

NEW DELHI: India on Saturday distanced itself from a statement issued by the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) condemning recent Israeli strikes on Iran, clarifying that it did not participate in the discussions that led to the group's remarks.In a statement, the ministry of external affairs (MEA) said, “The Shanghai Cooperation Organization has issued a statement on recent developments between Israel and Iran. India did not participate in the discussions on the above-mentioned SCO statement.”The MEA reaffirmed India's independent stance on the Israel-Iran tensions, first articulated on June 13, and reiterated its call for calm and dialogue. “We urge that channels of dialogue and diplomacy be utilised to work towards de-escalation. It is essential that the international community undertake endeavours in that direction,” the statement read.External affairs minister S Jaishankar also conveyed India’s concerns directly to his Iranian counterpart during a recent conversation. According to the MEA, Jaishankar highlighted the international community's deep concern over the rising tensions and emphasized the need to avoid further escalation and return to diplomatic engagement.The SCO statement had strongly denounced Israel’s strikes on Iranian territory, describing them as “aggressive actions against civilian targets, including energy and transport infrastructure,” which it said caused civilian casualties and violated international law and the UN Charter. It also reaffirmed support for resolving tensions around Iran’s nuclear program through peaceful and diplomatic means and expressed condolences to the Iranian people and government.India, however, reiterated its independent stance, first stated on June 13, which emphasized restraint, dialogue, and diplomacy. “India urges both sides to avoid any escalatory steps. Existing channels of dialogue and diplomacy should be utilised to work towards a de-escalation of the situation and resolving underlying issues,” the earlier MEA statement had said.The ministry added that Jaishankar had recently spoken with his Iranian counterpart, conveying the deep concern of the international community and reiterating the need to avoid further escalation and return to diplomatic processes.India emphasized its “close and friendly relations with both countries” and reaffirmed its readiness to extend support towards efforts for peace. The MEA also noted that Indian missions in Iran and Israel remain in contact with the Indian community, advising nationals to remain cautious and follow local advisories.","India distanced itself from a statement issued by the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) condemning recent Israeli strikes on Iran.

As the world marks World Blood Donor Day on June 14, a quiet but powerful movement in Dubai is being celebrated for its life-saving impact. Founded by a small group of Indian expatriates in 2015, the Kindness Blood Donation Team has now grown into one of the emirate’s most impactful volunteer initiatives, having helped save more than 25,000 lives throughover 250 donation campaigns.The Kindness Blood Donation Team was launched by Shihab Theruvath, Anwar Wayanad, and Salam Kanyappady, three Indian expats united by a shared sense of social responsibility. “We realised that many people didn’t know how many lives they can save, and even though they knew, many didn’t know where or how to do it regularly,” said Shihab Theruvath, who works in Dubai’s health sector, in an interview with“That’s when we felt we had to do something to create a simple way for people who wanted to donate to actually get the chance to do it,” he added.In 2015, they began by launching small donation drives, gradually expanding their network by using WhatsApp groups based on location. These groups made it easier to mobilise donors quickly, helping bridge the gap between blood need and availability.“Work schedules often held people back from donating. So, we brought the drives to them, organising campaigns in different parts of the city. The response has been overwhelming,” said Anwar Wayanad, also from the health sector.The team soon grew, attracting volunteers from diverse backgrounds, including:These volunteers, mostly from the Indian state of Kerala, continue to drive the message:The true resilience of the Kindness Team was tested during the COVID-19 pandemic, when strict lockdowns and public fear severely impacted blood donation rates. At a time when blood banks struggled, the team took action.“It was a time of fear, but it was also a time when we saw the best of humanity,” recalled Salam Kanyappady, a finance manager and entrepreneur, who regularly donates blood with his wife, Riyana Salam.In close partnership with the Dubai Blood Donation Centre and supported by the Dubai KMCC Kasargod District Committee, the team managed to sustain a series of safe, well-coordinated drives. Their trusted presence helped reassure the public and maintain critical blood supplies.Following the pandemic, the team expanded its outreach further, collaborating with community groups and alumni associations to run even more organised campaigns across Dubai.The impact of the group’s efforts has been recognised officially. Shihab Theruvath was recently awarded a certificate of appreciation by the Dubai Blood Donation Centre, a testament to the group’s unwavering commitment.As Anwar told, “Over the years, we have received overwhelming support from donors of various nationalities. In close coordination with the Dubai Blood Donation Centre, we have been organising regular, well-structured blood donation campaigns, covering different areas of Dubai and making it convenient for donors to participate.”He added, “We extend our heartfelt gratitude to the Dubai Blood Donation Centre under Dubai Health for their unwavering support in helping us turn our vision into a reality, as well as to the dedicated team of volunteers and our committed donors who continue to drive this mission forward.”To mark World Blood Donor Day 2025, the team launched a youth-led campaign titled: “Give Blood, Give Hope: Together We Save Lives.” The drive, held on Friday, brought in student volunteers in a bid to inspire younger generations to become regular donors.Many of the group’s volunteers and supporters have now taken the next step by donating platelets and red cells, highlighting the campaign’s growing sophistication and awareness outreach.Blood donation in the UAE is a strictly regulated process to ensure the health and safety of both donors and recipients. Here's what donors should be aware of:According to the World Health Organization (WHO), one unit of donated blood can save up to three lives, as blood can be separated into red cells, plasma, and platelets, each serving different critical medical needs.Celebrated every year on June 14, World Blood Donor Day (WBDD) was established in 2004 to raise global awareness about the importance of safe blood donation. It commemorates the birth of Karl Landsteiner, the scientist who discovered blood groups, and serves as a tribute to voluntary blood donors worldwide.","The Kindness Blood Donation Team was launched by Shihab Theruvath, Anwar Wayanad, and Salam Kanyappady, three Indian expats united by a shared sense of social responsibility.

Strong Compliance Reflects UAE’s Humanitarian Values

Poll Do you support the Midday Work Ban in the UAE? Yes, it's essential for worker safety. No, it disrupts work schedules.

Active Inspections and Supportive Measures for Worker Safety

Exceptions, Monitoring, and Penalties





Starting Sunday, June 15, the Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratization (MoHRE) will enforce the Midday Work Ban, a regulation prohibiting outdoor work under direct sunlight between 12:30 PM and 3:00 PM. This ban, which continues through September 15, aims to prevent heat-related illnesses and injuries during the hottest months of the year.The Ministry’s website highlights that this marks the 21st consecutive year of the ban’s implementation, underscoring the UAE’s commitment to global occupational health and safety standards. The initiative is a crucial part of creating safer work environments across the country during summer’s peak heat.According to Mohsen Al Nassi, Assistant Undersecretary for the Inspection and Compliance Sector at MoHRE:“The Midday Work Ban has achieved an outstanding compliance rate of over 99% for consecutive years, which highlights the deep-rooted social and humanitarian values within the UAE’s business community and private sector. It also reflects an advanced level of awareness regarding the importance of safeguarding human capital, which is a company’s most valuable asset.Moreover, it underscores the humane and progressive nature of UAE labour laws, particularly in relation to occupational safety and health. ”Similarly, Dalal Al Shehhi, Acting Assistant Undersecretary for the Labor Protection Sector, pointed out that:“The Midday Work Ban has become a leading example of partnership between the Ministry, the private sector, and members of the community. This is reflected in the way partners have developed initiatives for workers during the ban period, thereby promoting the concept of social responsibility and highlighting the success of awareness strategies and the entrenchment of humanitarian values in the UAE’s work environment. ”The UAE, home to more than 200 nationalities, continues to align this regulation with the broader “We the UAE 2031” vision, fostering a thriving and inclusive society.MoHRE conducts regular field inspections at worksites and workers’ accommodations to raise awareness and enforce compliance with the ban. These visits help prevent heat exhaustion and sunstroke by reinforcing the importance of adhering to safety standards.Many private companies support this initiative by providing fully equipped rest areas during the banned hours. These spaces include shaded areas, fans, sufficient drinking water, hydrating salts approved by local authorities, and first aid kits. Such measures ensure workers can rest and recover safely before resuming their duties.The ban allows exceptions for critical work that cannot be paused, such as asphalt laying, concrete pouring, and emergency repairs affecting utilities or traffic. However, these activities require authorization from relevant government authorities and must be completed promptly.To ensure strict compliance, MoHRE encourages public reporting of violations through its call centre (600590000), official website, and mobile app. Companies violating the ban face fines of AED 5,000 per offending worker, with a maximum fine of AED 50,000 for multiple violations.MoHRE continues to strengthen awareness campaigns and inspections in collaboration with both public and private sectors to maintain a safe and healthy work environment during the summer months.","UAE enforces Midday Work Ban from June 15 to September 15, banning outdoor work from 12:30 PM to 3:00 PM, with 99% compliance and fines up to AED 50,000.

Iran launched a powerful retaliatory strike late Friday night, targeting one of Israel's most heavily guarded military sites, the Kirya compound in Tel Aviv, following Israel's Operation Rising Lion, which targeted Iran's nuclear facility at Natanz.The Kirya, often referred to as Israel's version of the Pentagon, houses the Israel Defence Forces' (IDF) general staff, the ministry of defence, and critical military command and intelligence units.It also includes Camp Rabin, named after former Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, and is considered vital for Israel’s national security operations.According to reports, Iran fired a barrage of missiles at the Tel Aviv-based military complex, striking deep into Israel's defence infrastructure.Israel's well-known Iron Dome air defence system failed to stop the targeted attack launched by the Khamenei-led Islamic Republic.Also read: ‘Talks with US meaningless’: Iran rules out nuclear talks; Tehran blames US for backing Israel The New York Times verified alarming social media footage showing a missile slamming into the area, causing what was described as ""significant damage.""""This is Israel’s version of the Pentagon, the Kiryat, and the building on this compound was just hit,"" Fox News reported.""There is significant damage.""The dramatic videos showed Israel’s air defence systems firing interceptors into the night sky moments before a large explosion lit up central Tel Aviv.

Poll Should international bodies play a more active role in de-escalating regional military conflicts? Yes, stronger global intervention is needed. No, such matters should be handled internally.





In a bid to fill the military vacuum left by Israel’s fatal strikes that killed several top Iranian commanders, Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Saturday appointed Major General Amir Hatami as the new Chief Commander of the Army of the Islamic Republic of Iran.The announcement, reported by Iranian state media outlet IRNA, marks a significant leadership change as Tehran seeks to stabilise its military structure after Israel’s large-scale offensive.Hatami, who served as Iran's Defence Minister from 2013 to 2021, now steps into a critical role at a time of heightened regional tensions.In his official decree, Khamenei commended Hatami's ""dedication, competence, and experience,"" urging him to lead with a ""transformative and revolutionary approach,"" according to IRNA.Khamenei also expressed gratitude to Major General Seyyed Abdolrahim Mousavi for his ""sincere and valuable efforts"" during his tenure.The reshuffle follows the killing of Iran's former Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces (CSAF) General Mohammad Hossein Bagheri, who, according to Iranian authorities, was assassinated ""at the hands of the evil Zionist regime."" Khamenei later appointed Mousavi as Bagheri’s successor.“In view of the martyrdom of Lieutenant General Mohammad Hossein Bagheri at the hands of the evil Zionist regime, & in light of Major General Sayyid Abdolrahim Mousavi's meritorious services & valuable experience, I appoint him as Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces,” Khamenei posted on X.Khamenei also made sweeping changes across other key military branches, replacing top officials killed in Israel’s Operation Rising Lion airstrikes.Major General Mohammad Pakpour has been named the new Commander-in-Chief of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) after the death of Lieutenant General Hossein Salami in the Israeli strikes.“In view of the martyrdom of Lieutenant General Hossein Salami at the hands of the vile Zionist regime, and in light of Major General Mohammad Pakpour's meritorious services and valuable experience, I appoint him as Commander-in-Chief of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps,” Khamenei announced.Further, Major General Ali Shadmani was appointed Commander of the Khatam al-Anbiya (pbuh) Central Headquarters, following the assassination of Lieutenant General Gholamali Rashid. Khamenei posted, “In view of Lt. Gen. Gholamali Rashid's martyrdom at the hands of the vile Zionist regime, and in light of Major General Ali Shadmani's meritorious services & valuable experience, I confer the rank of Major Gen. & appoint him Commander of the Khatam al-Anbiya (pbuh) Central HQ. ”According to a CNN report, Israel’s Operation Rising Lion dealt a devastating blow to Iran’s top military leadership, killing high-ranking officers, including the heads of the IRGC, the air force, and a former national security chief.Among the key figures killed was Major General Hossein Salami, the powerful commander of the IRGC who had led the elite force since 2019. Salami played a pivotal role in Iran’s military offensives, including direct missile and drone attacks on Israel in April and October 2024.CNN further reported that Major General Mohammad Bagheri, the former Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces, was another significant casualty. Bagheri was instrumental in military coordination, foreign policy engagements in Syria, and diplomatic talks with Saudi Arabia.Ali Shamkhani, a long-time aide to Khamenei and former national security chief, also died in the Israeli strike. Shamkhani had recently been involved in Iran’s diplomatic overtures, including China-brokered talks with Saudi Arabia.Also read: Explainer: How Iran's nuclear progress triggered Israeli strike - and why it matters Amir Ali Hajizadeh, the commander of the IRGC’s air force and the strategist behind Iran’s 2020 missile attacks on Israel and US military bases in Iraq, was also killed.

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on Friday confirmed that Israeli airstrikes on Iran’s Natanz nuclear site caused internal radiological and chemical contamination.However, radiation levels outside the facility remain normal and do not pose a threat to the public or environment, said IAEA director general Rafael Grossi in his statement to the UN security council.""However, due to the impacts, there is radiological and chemical contamination inside the facilities in Natanz. The type of radiation present inside the facility, primarily alpha particles, is manageable with appropriate radiation protection measures,"" he said in his statement.Grossi revealed that the Israeli strikes destroyed the above-ground section of the Pilot Fuel Enrichment Plant, which was enriching uranium up to 60 per cent U-235. The attack also damaged electrical infrastructure, including both main and emergency power systems.Although the underground cascade hall appears undamaged, the loss of power may have affected the centrifuges inside.Iran informed the agency that only the Natanz site was directly hit, which includes the Fuel Enrichment Plant and the Pilot Fuel Enrichment Plant.However, Iran also reported nearby attacks at the Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant and the Esfahan complex, which houses several other nuclear facilities.The IAEA is in constant contact with Iran’s Nuclear Regulatory Authority to monitor the situation and assess the damage, said Grossi. A special task force has been established to monitor developments and update the UN Security Council as needed.Grossi expressed deep concern over the Israeli attack, reiterating that “nuclear facilities must never be attacked, regardless of the context or circumstances.”Following the strikes, Israel said that Iran was closer than ever to developing a nuclear weapon and described the attack as a necessary act of defence.

The Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) on Saturday apologised to Indians on X for sharing a post that depicted an incorrect map of India.The IDF acknowledged the mistake and clarified that the post was intended as an illustration of the region.“This map fails to precisely depict borders. We apologise for any offense caused by this image,” the IDF wrote on X.The image, shared with the caption, “Iran is a global threat. Israel is not the end goal, it’s only the beginning. We had no other choice but to act,” visually illustrated the range of Iran’s missiles. The map placed Iran at the centre, with concentric circles marking missile ranges of 300 km, 500 km, 800 km, 1,300 km, and 2,000 km, extending the threat to countries across the Middle East, North Africa, South Asia, and parts of Europe and Asia.The graphic was intended to emphasise that Iran’s missile capabilities are not just a threat to Israel but pose a wider regional and potentially global danger.However, a major flaw in the image was the incorrect depiction of India’s map. The map omitted Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh, which are constitutionally integral parts of India. Aksai Chin, which is part of Ladakh, was also excluded from Indian territory. Arunachal Pradesh was also misrepresented in the map.Tensions in the Middle East escalated sharply overnight as Iran launched missile strikes toward Israel late Friday and into early Saturday, in retaliation for Israel’s Operation ""Rising Lion.""The confrontation erupted after what Israeli officials described as the country’s ""greatest military operations in history"" against Iran.

Point of no return: Army chief





JERUSALEM: Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu Friday said the attacks were authorised over six months ago, in November 2024, and was initially scheduled for April 2025, but were postponed due to operational considerations. In a recorded speech in Hebrew, Netanyahu provided updates about the operation to citizens. A visibly elated Netanyahu said he will try to make such statements daily.""This didn't happen by chance or for trivial reasons - if Iran has nuclear weapons, we simply won't be here,"" he said. Netanyahu said that following the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, Israel made an assessment that Iran would expedite its nuclear programme, which it did. Earlier on Friday morning, in a video message, he said Iran has reached a level of uranium enrichment that it could soon develop some nine atom bombs. He also cautioned citizens not to be in euphoria over the success of the operation and stay calm and vigilant. He asserted that there would be retaliation and may be ""a price"" to pay.Israel's chief of staff lieutenant general Eyal Zamir, said the offensive was launched ""because the time had come; we'd reached the point of no return"".

The last time Israel and Iran traded attacks, Israel received strong support from many allies. Britain and the US provided backup in the form of fighter jets, refuelling planes and air defence systems. Neighbouring Jordan confirmed it had shot down Iranian missiles and drones. Some West Asian states allowed Israel to transit their airspace.This time around, there was less understanding and more concern. Some European allies worried Israel was ratcheting up a conflict with Iran after eight months of simmering tensions but no overt warfare. ""Escalation serves no one in the region,"" PM Keir Starmer of Britain said, while EU's chief diplomat, Kaja Kallas, called the situation ""dangerous"". Those remarks followed a growing chorus of European condemnation of Israel over the past few months for escalating the war in Gaza. Some of the sharpest condemnation came from countries in the region. Egypt, which has a longstanding peace treaty with Israel, called the strikes ""a direct threat to regional and international peace and security"".Still, a number of key allies, including the US, stood behind Israel and expressed mounting frustration with Iran's advancing nuclear programme. And should Iran launch a powerful counterattack against Israel, allies could still come to the country's defence militarily.","Last time Israel and Iran traded attacks, Israel received strong support from many allies.

From Tech CEO to Relentless Critic



Political Pressure Closes In



Starmer Responds



Why a Statutory Inquiry Matters



Subpoena witnesses, including former officials, police officers, and social workers;

Demand the release of classified documents and internal reports;

Take testimony from survivors in private or public;

Recommend structural reforms for law enforcement, social services, and public communication.

For many survivors, this is the first time they feel their voices might lead to actual accountability.

What Happens Next



Musk’s involvement, while controversial, showed how digital platforms can force action on long-ignored issues.

Starmer’s government is now under pressure to implement swift reforms and offer compensation to survivors.

The political debate has sharpened, with opposition parties vowing to make grooming gangs a central issue in the next election.

Final Word







After years of public outcry, multiple local reviews, and political hesitation, the UK government has announced a full national statutory inquiry into grooming gangs and institutional failures that enabled decades of child sexual exploitation.The decision, announced by Prime Minister Keir Starmer on June 14, marks a dramatic shift in tone for his administration—one that had previously resisted demands for a public investigation into what many see as one of Britain’s worst safeguarding scandals.The tipping point? A perfect storm of political pressure, survivor testimony, community backlash—and unusually, a global spotlight powered by Elon Musk , who used his platform, X (formerly Twitter), to repeatedly target Starmer’s record on grooming gangs.The term “grooming gangs” refers to loosely organised groups of men who exploited underage girls—typically white, working-class, and often in care—in towns across northern England from the early 1990s onwards.The 2014 Jay Report on Rotherham, commissioned after investigative journalism exposed widespread abuse, identified over 1,400 victims between 1997 and 2013. Similar patterns were later uncovered in Rochdale, Telford, Oxford, and Oldham.What made the cases especially sensitive was the ethnic background of many offenders—in several high-profile cases, the perpetrators were men of Pakistani Muslim heritage. However, the official framing used the broader term “Asian grooming gangs”—a euphemism that triggered resentment among British Indians, Sikhs, and East Asians who said their communities were being unfairly implicated.British-Indian communities, especially Hindus and Sikhs, have long objected to the blanket use of the term “Asian grooming gangs.” Their frustration boiled over in January this year when Starmer, in response to criticism from Elon Musk, once again used the phrase during a televised interview.Community leaders issued sharp statements denouncing what they called an ethnic smear. “Why should we be classified as part of these gangs?” asked Jay Shah, spokesperson for Friends of India Society International UK. “Asian means Vietnamese, Sri Lankan, Japanese, Indian, etc. When it comes to grooming gangs, we are Asian. When it comes to Kashmir, we are Indian.”The Hindu Council UK called Starmer’s wording a “whitewash of heinous atrocities,” noting that Hindu and Sikh girls had also been among the victims. Sikh Youth UK, which has documented grooming cases involving Sikh victims for over 15 years, said it had worked with thousands of families and even caught perpetrators outside Sikh schools. The Network of Sikh Organisations described Starmer’s comments as “extremely disappointing” and accused politicians of “protecting perpetrators rather than victims.”Both the Hindu Council UK and INSIGHT UK have since backed Conservative calls for a national inquiry—arguing that political correctness has too often silenced honest debate about ethnicity and crime.The turning point came not from Westminster but from Silicon Valley.In early 2025, Elon Musk—whose X platform has grown into a global political amplifier—began posting repeatedly about grooming gangs. Quoting survivor testimonies, reposting historical reporting, and tagging British officials, Musk accused UK authorities of “turning a blind eye to organised rape” and suggested that political leaders, including Starmer, were “cowards unwilling to confront the truth.”One post from March read: “If these were elite London girls being trafficked, the BBC would talk about nothing else. But poor northern girls? The state looked away.”While the tone of Musk’s commentary sparked debate—especially among British politicians who viewed it as inflammatory—it undeniably brought renewed international attention to the issue.By May, Musk’s X account had posted or amplified over 150 messages about grooming gangs, triggering renewed media coverage, a spike in search interest, and thousands of public responses. Hashtags such as #JusticeForRotherham, #GroomingGangsInquiry, and #StarmerFailedUs trended across the UK and US.The growing visibility added fuel to a debate already brewing in Parliament.In January, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper had quietly commissioned Baroness Louise Casey to conduct a “rapid review” into previous investigations—including Oldham and Rochdale—after persistent claims that public officials downplayed or ignored evidence of abuse.Casey’s report, delivered in May, was damning. It found that multiple public bodies “failed in their duty of care” and that in some cases, victims were dismissed or even blamed. Crucially, it called for a full statutory public inquiry with the ability to compel testimony and evidence.Simultaneously, Conservative MPs, Reform UK leaders, and victim advocacy groups demanded action. Former Home Secretary Suella Braverman, a long-time critic of the “Asian gangs” terminology, stated that Starmer had “run out of excuses.” Reform UK leader Nigel Farage called the lack of a national inquiry “a betrayal of Britain’s daughters.”On June 14, Keir Starmer announced the establishment of a judge-led inquiry under the 2005 Inquiries Act, which gives it full legal powers. He said the investigation would “examine past failures, hold institutions to account, and ensure this can never happen again.”Starmer, who previously served as Director of Public Prosecutions, defended his record, pointing to a rise in grooming-related prosecutions during his tenure. But critics argue that his earlier reluctance to endorse a national inquiry allowed the issue to fester—and exposed Labour to accusations of institutional denial.“There is no more denying the scale of failure,” Starmer said at a press conference. “This inquiry is about justice—for survivors, for their families, and for the country.”Unlike previous reviews—many of which lacked transparency and enforcement—this inquiry has legal teeth. It can:The inquiry will take several months to set up, with hearings likely to begin in early 2026. Its findings could reshape the way Britain handles child protection, race relations, and public accountability. But in the short term, it’s already had an impact:This is not just a story of abuse—it’s a story of institutional failure, political caution, and the new ways power is exercised across borders and platforms. Whether the inquiry delivers justice remains to be seen. But for the thousands of girls whose pain was ignored—and for the communities wrongly smeared along the way—this is a reckoning long overdue.","After years of public outcry, multiple local reviews, and political hesitation, the UK government has announced a full national statutory inquiry into grooming gangs.

LONDON: Three British Hindu men were asked their ethnicity in a London park and, when they replied they were Indian and Sri Lankan, were viciously beaten up in an unprovoked attack by three older men who appeared to be Muslim, it has emerged.Two of the men suffered blows to the head and were left unconscious; all had to go to Northwick Park Hospital. They have all been left with cuts and bruises and two have been left with facial fractures. Tory MP Bob Blackman raised the case in the House of Commons on Thursday, describing it as “religious hatred.”TOI has now tracked down the sister of one of the men, a British Indian Gujarati Hindu, aged 20, a first-year university student studying radiography. It turns out he had gone to Harrow Recreation Ground with two friends on May 30 to play cricket. The friends are British Hindus of Sri Lankan descent, aged 20 and 21.The three of them went to a shop at 6 pm, walking past a café where a group of around eight people were seated. It appeared to be a Muslim family, with some of the women wearing hijabs. They looked back at their other friends playing cricket when one of the men outside the café got up and confronted the three Hindus and asked them why they were looking at his family, his sister told TOI.They replied that they were not looking at his family and were looking at friends playing cricket. Then a slightly older man from the café group came over and asked: “What is your problem? Why are you talking to my brother?” The three men tried to defuse the situation and the two men seemed to accept their answer.They went back to the park and sat on a bench.Around 30 minutes later, three men from the cafe group, in their mid to late 20s, came over and became very aggressive, asking, “Where are you from? Are you Sri Lankan? Are you Indian?”To which one of the Sri Lankan-origin men replied: ”Yes, we are.”The three men then beat them up relentlessly, punching and kicking them until the British Indian and his friend were left lying unconscious on the ground, the sister said.“My brother was wearing a sacred thread from a mandir on his wrist,” the sister said.One of the attackers was wearing a Moroccan football T-shirt with the number 2 and the word “Hakimi”.Police and ambulances arrived and the British Indian was taken to the hospital. The other two had to make their own way there.“My brother is struggling. He feels as if people are looking at him and is ashamed to step out of the house. He has never been involved in a fight before,” the sister told TOI on Friday.“He has just done his first-year exams and was meant to resume his two-week clinical placement the week after the attack and that has been put on hold.” She also said she was unhappy with how the police investigation was progressing, as two weeks later, they still had not examined CCTV footage.The Met Police told TOI they were called to deal with a “fight” and one man was taken to hospital “with a head injury”. “There is no evidence at this time that this attack was racially motivated.

TOI correspondent from London: Indigenous communities across India are being pushed out of their ancestral lands in the name of tourism and expansion of tiger projects whilst the laws to protect them are being diluted and not implemented properly, Adivasis told a global press briefing on Monday.“They say India has got freedom. But I think Adivasi people have not yet got freedom,” J C Shivamma, from the Jenu Kuruba tribe, said at the online event organised by Community Network Against Protected Areas.She is among the 52 households who reoccupied their ancestral land within Nagarhole tiger reserve on May 5, 35 years after their families were forcibly evicted.“Some of our family members died when in the plantations, but our sacred deities, our graveyard, everything that concerns us, is still in the village, so we used to go back to bury our people in our ancestral land, but it was always a fight with the forest department toconduct rituals. We consider our ancestors to be on the lands, they become deities and this way we were tortured. If we have to die, we will die on our ancestral land,” she said.Shivu JA recalled how their houses were burnt and elephants brought to destroy their fields when they were evicted from Karadikallu. “This land is ours. It's not any tiger project or scheme of the govt for tiger conservation,” he said.“Our elders are very happy now.We are having our food, we are going for honey collection. We have our own water resource. We sit together in the evening, and they are teaching us songs. All these songs and lessons were silenced for 40 years.""“The forest department keeps saying that only after your rights are recognised, you can live on this land. We already have these rights,” he said.The Jenu Kurubas are filing a case against the Forest Department under the SC/ST Atrocities Act for withholding their rights and filing an appeal against 39 rejected forest rights claims.“Why are their rights not being recognised despite the notification of central legislation such as the Forest Rights Act 2006,” asked scholar Nitin Rai.“People across the country in different states are fighting the same battles. It is important to find a way to raise a collective voice for what is happening all over,” said lawyer Lara Jesani.","Indigenous communities across India are being pushed out of their ancestral lands in the name of tourism and expansion of tiger projects. 52 households reoccupied their ancestral land within Nagarhole tiger reserve on May 5, 35 years after their families were forcibly evicted.

Summer drought risk







LONDON: The UK experienced its warmest spring on record, and its driest in more than 50 years, the country's official weather service said on Monday.Temperatures for the season have been frequently elevated this century, according to the data from the Met Office, which said: ""Eight of the 10 warmest UK springs have occurred since the year 2000. ""The data ""clearly shows that recent decades have been warmer, sunnier, and often drier than the 20th century average,"" said Met Office scientist Emily Carlisle.The Met Office said provisional temperatures registered between March and May this year averaged 9.51 degrees Celsius (49.1 degrees Fahrenheit).That beat the last record, set in last year's spring, when the average was 9.37 degrees.The next warmest springs were in 2011, 2014 and 2007, according to the Met Office which has been recording temperature data since 1884.This year, the 128.2 millimetres (five inches) of rainfall recorded across the UK during the season was ""approximately 40 percent below the long-term average and still the driest spring in more than 50 years"", it said.""England was particularly dry, experiencing its driest spring in more than 100 years, beaten only by 1893,"" it added.The Met Office's Carlisle said: ""The UK's climate continues to change. What's particularly notable about spring 2025 is the combination of record warmth and sunshine, alongside very low rainfall.""""This spring shows some of the changes we're seeing in our weather patterns, with more extreme conditions, including prolonged dry, sunny weather, becoming more frequent,"" she said.The recent weather's dominant feature had been the persistent high-pressure systems, often coming from the Azores or mainland Europe.These had lingered over the UK since late February and blocked the usual flow of Atlantic weather fronts, allowing high pressure to dominate, the Met Office said.Last month, the Environment Agency (EA) called a meeting of its national drought group after it said levels in reservoirs were ""exceptionally low"".In the meeting, the EA's deputy water director, Richard Thompson warned that ""changing climate means we will see more summer droughts in the coming decades"".The agency added that, while there was no official drought yet, there was a ""medium risk"" of a summer drought without sustained rainfall.The UK government has said it would step in to fast-track the building of two new reservoirs.According to the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs, no new water reservoirs have been built since 1992.Scientists warn that extreme and fluctuating weather events are becoming increasingly common as planet-heating fossil fuel emissions keep rising.","The UK experienced its warmest spring on record, and its driest in more than 50 years.

L ONDON: A Turkish-born man who burned a Quran in London was on Monday found guilty of a religiously aggravated public order offence, in a case taken up by free-speech campaigners.Hamit Coskun, 50, shouted ""Islam is religion of terrorism"" and ""Quran is burning"" as he set the book alight outside the Turkish consulate in London last February 13.District Judge John McGarva at London's Westminster Magistrates' Court found Coskun guilty of using disorderly behaviour ""within the hearing or sight of a person likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress"".He was motivated by ""hostility towards members of a religious group, namely followers of Islam"", said McGarva, who issued Coskun a £240 ($325) fine, with a statutory surcharge of £96.""Your actions in burning the Quran where you did were highly provocative, and your actions were accompanied by bad language in some cases directed toward the religion and were motivated at least in part by hatred of followers of the religion,"" said the judge.State prosecutors insisted Coskun was not being prosecuted for burning the book.""He is being prosecuted for his disorderly behaviour in public,"" said Philip McGhee, for the Crown Prosecution Service.A passerby filmed the incident, which also showed a man, allegedly holding a knife or bladed item, approaching Coskun and appearing to slash out at him, the court heard.Coskun, an atheist who is currently claiming asylum in the UK, posted on social media that he was protesting against the ""Islamist government"" of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.His legal fees are being paid by the Free Speech Union (FSU) and the National Secular Society, which argued he was essentially being prosecuted for blasphemy, despite Britain's free-speech guarantees.The FSU called the verdict ""deeply disappointing"" on its X account.""Everyone should be able to exercise their rights to protest peacefully and to freedom of expression, regardless of how offensive or upsetting it may be to some people,"" it said.","Hamit Coskun, 50, shouted ""Islam is religion of terrorism"" and ""Quran is burning"" as he set the book alight outside the Turkish consulate in London last February 13.

‘Will pay the price’: China sanctions 20 US firms over $10 bn arms sale to Taiwan; freezes all assets,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/will-pay-the-price-china-sanctions-20-us-firms-over-10-b-arms-sale-to-taiwan-freezes-all-assets/articleshow/126199219.cms,"Pentagon Drops Bombshell: U.S. Losing Top Allies To China Over Stealth Fighter Jets?

China on Friday announced sweeping countermeasures against 20 US defence-related companies and 10 senior executives, freezing their assets and banning business dealings in response to Washington’s approval of large-scale arms sales to Taiwan.The Chinese foreign ministry said the sanctions were imposed under China’s anti-foreign sanctions law and would take effect immediately.The move follows the US administration’s approval of a major arms package for Taiwan valued at over $10 billion, according to the US state department.Under the measures, all movable and immovable assets of the sanctioned companies located in China will be frozen, while Chinese organisations and individuals will be barred from conducting business or cooperation with them.Restrictions were also imposed on 10 senior executives, including Palmer Luckey, founder of Anduril Industries, limiting their assets and activities related to China.The sanctioned entities include major US defence firms such as Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation, L3Harris Maritime Services, Boeing (St Louis), Gibbs & Cox, VSE Corporation, Sierra Technical Services, Red Cat Holdings, Teal Drones, ReconCraft, Epirus, Dedrone Holdings, Area-I, Blue Force Technologies, Dive Technologies, Rhombus Power and Lazarus Enterprises, among others, the ministry said.Beijing said the US arms sales to Taiwan “seriously violate the one-China principle and the three China-US Joint Communiques, interfere in China’s internal affairs, and undermine China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity,” according to the foreign ministry statement carried by the Global Times.A ministry spokesperson said the Taiwan issue was at the core of China's national interest. “Anyone who attempts to cross the line and make provocations on the Taiwan question will be met with China’s firm response. Any company or individual who engages in arms sales to Taiwan will pay the price for the wrongdoing. No country or force shall ever underestimate the resolve, will and ability of the Chinese government and people to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity,” the spokesperson added.China also urged the US to honour its commitments, stop supplying weapons to Taiwan and avoid actions that could raise tensions in the Taiwan Strait, warning that it would continue to take “resolute measures” to protect its sovereignty and security.The sanctions follow the Trump administration’s approval last week of a major arms package for Taiwan, which the US state department said includes medium-range missiles, howitzers and drones. According to Focus Taiwan, the proposed sale could include eight arms packages, such as HIMARS rocket systems, anti-tank missiles and drones, with an estimated total value of $11.1 billion.Five of the packages are covered under a NT$1.25 trillion ($39.85 billion) special defence budget proposed by Taiwan’s government and awaiting legislative review, Focus Taiwan reported, citing the island’s defence ministry.China has repeatedly opposed US arms sales to Taiwan, warning that such moves threaten regional peace and stability.","China announces sweeping countermeasures against 20 US defence-related companies and 10 senior executives, freezing their assets and banning business dealings.

How Adin Ross’ $15,000 donation made a real difference for a viewer





Recently, Twitch-turned-Kick streamer Adin Ross gained headlines for his generous donation to a viewer going through homelessness with a proper $15,000. That happened in a live Kick broadcast where Ross was interacting with his viewers. The viewer revealed he and his mother didn't have a permanent place to live. Ross sprang into action immediately. His gesture shows how streamers on platforms like Kick can make tangible impacts in the real world by using their following and revenues in the service of viewers in need.

Saudi Arabia is taking a firmer stance against banned and counterfeit pesticides, with a draft regulation proposing jail terms, hefty fines, and strict enforcement measures. The new rules aim to protect public health, the environment, and agriculture, while giving authorities clear powers to penalize repeat offenders.The proposed regulation introduces strict consequences for anyone involved in manufacturing or importing banned or counterfeit pesticides. Under the draft, violators may face up to five years in prison, fines reaching SR10 million, or one of these two penalties. The Public Prosecution will investigate all violations and bring the cases before the competent court to enforce the penalties outlined in the regulation. In situations where the offender repeats the violation, the prosecution is authorized to double the penalties to ensure stronger compliance and deterrence.Not all violations will lead to immediate jail time or fines. The draft clarifies that if a violation is minor and does not cause significant harm to humans, animals, plants, the environment, or public health, the violator will first receive a warning. Authorities may then provide a grace period for the issue to be corrected before applying penalties.The Saudi Food and Drug Authority (SFDA) will play a central role in reviewing violations related to public health pesticides. Responsibilities of the SFDA under the draft include:Additionally, the Ministry of Environment, Water, and Agriculture can require violators to remove the cause of the violation. Repeating the offense within three years of a previous violation is considered a repeat offense, which can lead to doubling of fines.The draft also outlines strict measures for dealing with the materials involved in violations. These include:Beyond fines, the draft also allows authorities to temporarily close the facility for up to six months or even permanently shut it down in severe cases. Those penalized have the right to appeal the decision in the Administrative Court in accordance with its regulations.","Saudi Arabia proposes up to five years jail and SR10 million fine for banned pesticides.

The UAE is trading its sunny blue skies for a more atmospheric winter vibe this week.According to the National Centre of Meteorology (NCM), a weak extension of a low-pressure system is sweeping across the country from December 25 to December 29.This shift means residents can look forward to generally pleasant and moderate daytime temperatures, while the nights will take on a noticeably crisper, cooler edge.The National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) forecasts generally pleasant and moderate weather across the UAE from Thursday, Dec 25 through Monday, Dec 29. Temperatures will remain mild during the day and dip slightly at night, typical for the start of winter, as a weak low-pressure extension moves over the region.Expect scattered precipitation throughout the weekend. The NCM predicts that rainfall will be intermittent and vary in intensity, mostly appearing as light to moderate showers.Authorities are urging extra caution for commuters and mariners due to two major environmental hazards. High humidity levels will peak during the late night and early morning hours. This will likely result in thick mist and fog over inland and western areas.Drivers are advised to reduce speeds and closely follow police instructions on major highways.Sea conditions in the Arabian Gulf and the Sea of Oman will remain manageable until Saturday. However, by Sunday, fresh northwesterly winds will cause the sea to become rough. Mariners and beachgoers should avoid deep-sea activities as the wind speeds increase.The UAE is currently experiencing its coldest week of the season. A weather station at Jebel Jais in Ras Al Khaimah recorded a bone-chilling 3.5°C at midnight recently, the lowest temperature of the year.As the rain clouds move in, daytime temperatures across the country will remain moderate, but nighttime temperatures will continue to dip significantly, especially in the desert and mountainous regions.

Why was the licence revoked?

What does this mean for you?

Knowing that the CBUAE is actively monitoring and ""pruning"" the market of non-compliant players means you can have higher confidence in the remaining licensed exchange houses.

These regulations are designed to prevent scams, fraud, and the misuse of financial platforms. A cleaner system means fewer risks for your personal hard-earned money.

By enforcing these rules, the UAE remains a globally respected financial hub. This keeps exchange rates competitive and ensures that international banks continue to work smoothly with UAE-based institutions.





The Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE) has taken decisive action against Omda Exchange, revoking its licence and striking the company’s name off the official register of licensed entities. The regulator also imposed a financial penalty of Dh10 million on the foreign exchange firm. This enforcement follows supervisory examinations that uncovered multiple breaches of UAE banking laws and regulations.The move was carried out under the Decretal Federal Law on the Central Bank and the Organisation of Financial Institutions and Activities, which gives the CBUAE the authority to regulate, supervise, and enforce compliance across financial institutions operating in the country.According to official statements and regulatory findings, the CBUAE’s examinations revealed that Omda Exchange failed to comply with core legal and regulatory requirements. While specific details of each breach have not been fully disclosed publicly, the Central Bank’s action fits a broader pattern of strict enforcement against exchange houses that fall short of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and other compliance standards.The move underscores the bank’s mandate to ensure that financial service providers adhere to legal obligations and internal controls that safeguard the integrity of financial transactions in the UAE.You might wonder how a corporate fine affects the average resident sending money home. The impact is actually very positive for the ""common man."" When the Central Bank takes such strict action, it is working to ensure that every dirham you hand over at a counter is safe.This latest enforcement is part of a broader, ongoing trend. In recent months, we have seen the CBUAE impose various fines—ranging from Dh2 million to over Dh100 million, on different financial entities. This consistent ""watchful eye"" is part of the UAE's commitment to aligning with international standards set by global bodies like the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).The Central Bank has stated that it will continue to ensure that all exchange houses, their owners, and their staff strictly abide by UAE laws.This isn't just about punishment; it’s about prevention. By maintaining a transparent and high-standard environment, the UAE ensures that its financial system remains one of the most stable and secure in the world for residents and investors alike","The Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE) has taken decisive action against Omda Exchange, revoking its licence and striking the company’s name off the official register of licensed entities.

Trump Quizzes Kids On Christmas, Then Drops US Border Warning As Melania Watches; 'No Bad Santa...'





US President Donald Trump has said he personally ordered American airstrikes against Islamic State-linked militants in northwestern Nigeria to be delayed so they could be carried out on Christmas Day, describing the operation as a “Christmas present. ”The strikes, launched a day after Christmas, marked a rare and highly symbolic escalation of US military involvement in Nigeria’s long-running security crisis.Speaking to Politico, Trump said the operation had originally been scheduled earlier in the week but that he intervened to change the timing. “They were going to do it earlier, and I said, ‘nope, let’s give a Christmas present,’” he said. Trump claimed the militants did not expect the attack and insisted the strikes were devastating, adding that “every camp got decimated”.The president first announced the strikes on social media, framing them as retaliation for the killing of Christians by Islamic State militants “at levels not seen for many years, and even centuries”. His comments initially raised concerns in Nigeria about a potential breach of sovereignty. Nigerian and US officials later confirmed that the operation was jointly coordinated and had the approval of Nigerian President Bola Tinubu.Nigeria’s Information Minister Mohammed Idris said the attack was carried out with the full involvement of the Nigerian armed forces, describing it as part of ongoing intelligence sharing and strategic cooperation between Abuja and Washington. US Africa Command confirmed there were multiple casualties but did not specify which armed faction was hit.Nigerian authorities said two Islamic State enclaves inside the Bauni forest in Sokoto state were targeted. The strikes were carried out using guided missiles launched from Reaper drones operating from maritime platforms in the Gulf of Guinea. Some debris reportedly fell in parts of Sokoto and neighbouring Kwara state, but the government said no civilians were injured.","US President said he personally ordered airstrikes against Islamic State-linked militants in Nigeria to be delayed so they could be carried out on Christmas Day.

California floods kill three





Severe storms across the United States during the Christmas holiday caused widespread travel disruption, with more than 1,800 flights cancelled and thousands delayed. Meanwhile, catastrophic flooding in California has claimed at least three lives, officials said.Holiday travel was hit hardest as winter storm Devin swept across large parts of the country, bringing heavy snow to the Northeast and Midwest and record-breaking rainfall to California.According to flight-tracking website FlightAware, airlines cancelled 1,802 flights and delayed over 22,000 more by Friday afternoon, as millions of Americans attempted to return home after Christmas.The Upper Midwest, Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions experienced a white Christmas, with snow, sleet and freezing rain affecting road and air travel. New York’s major airports: John F Kennedy International, Newark Liberty and LaGuardia, were among the worst hit, accounting for more than half of all flight cancellations nationwide. JetBlue cancelled the most flights, followed closely by Delta Air Lines, Republic Airways and American Airlines, Reuters reported.Spokespersons for American Airlines, United Airlines and JetBlue said that change fees had been waived for affected passengers.Explaining the scale of disruption, a JetBlue spokesperson said, “Due to winter storm Devin, JetBlue has canceled approximately 350 flights today and tomorrow, primarily in the Northeast where JetBlue has a large operation.”Ahead of the storm, New York and New Jersey declared states of emergency. Announcing the move, New York Governor Kathy Hochul said, “As widespread snowfall is expected to start in New York City and its surrounding areas this evening, I will declare a State of Emergency to ensure that our agencies and local partners have the resources and tools they need to respond to the storm.”New Jersey Acting Governor Tahesha Way also urged caution to travellers. In a statement, she said, “This storm will cause dangerous road conditions and impact holiday travel. We are urging travellers to avoid travel during the storm and allow crews to tend to the roads.”The National Weather Service warned that winter storm Devin would create hazardous travel conditions from the Great Lakes to the northern Mid-Atlantic and southern New England through Saturday morning.In New York City and surrounding areas, forecasters predicted snowfall rates of one to two inches per hour, with total accumulation of up to 11 inches in some locations. New York City Emergency Management advised residents, “Do not travel unless you absolutely have to.”While snow battered the Northeast, California faced a very different crisis. Historic rainfall from a powerful atmospheric river flooded streets, triggered mudslides, caused mass power outages and forced water rescues across the state. Officials said three people died in weather-related incidents between Sunday and Wednesday.Among them was Sacramento County sheriff’s deputy James Caravallo, who died in a single-vehicle crash while driving to work on Christmas Eve, with authorities believing wet road conditions played a role. In San Diego, Roberto Ruiz died after a large tree branch fell on him during the storm, sending him into cardiac arrest, NBC reported.Mountain communities such as Wrightwood, northeast of Los Angeles, were among the worst affected, receiving nearly a foot of rain. Floodwaters reached homes and buried vehicles in mud. One resident described waking up to a “river running through our property.”Residents recounted frightening scenes as the storm intensified. Jill Jenkins, who was spending Christmas in Wrightwood with her grandson, said, “It’s really a crazy Christmas.” Her grandson, Hunter Lopiccolo, described how the family coped during power outages, saying, “We just played card games all night with candles and flashlights.”Others carried out rescues on their own. Davey Schneider said he hiked through floodwaters to save pets trapped in his grandfather’s home. “I wanted to help them out because I wasn’t confident that they were going to live,” he said, adding, “Fortunately, they all lived.

Mamdani Distances Himself As NYC Official Quits In Disgrace Over ‘Indefensible’ Anti-Jew Posts





NEW YORK: Matthias Nicolls did not create this problem.A 17th century New York statesman before New York was a state, Nicolls was a man of many accomplishments. He drafted an early legal code for the colony of New York and served as the speaker of the Assembly. His great-grandson William Floyd signed the Declaration of Independence. His family owned vast swaths of Long Island. His modern descendants include musical nobility (David Crosby).On top of that, in 1671, Nicolls was appointed the sixth mayor of New York.But it turns out that in 1674, he was also appointed the eighth mayor of New York. And this fact has caused a near-existential crisis for Zohran Mamdani , the mayor-elect: Will he become New York City's 111th mayor, or its 112th?The sources of confusion are numerous, as reported by the news site Gothamist, which brought the whole sordid tale to light.Part of the problem is a numbering convention whereby a mayor who serves two nonconsecutive terms gets counted twice, just as Donald Trump is considered both the 45th and 47th president.Another complicating factor is the misplacement of a historical record called the Minutes of the Mayor's Court, which somehow persisted for more than three centuries.Here's what happened.From 1653 to 1665, New Amsterdam, as New York was then known under Dutch rule, was run by a pair of officials called burgomasters.Under English rule, starting in 1665 New York had mayors appointed by the colonial governor. Nicolls, in 1671, was the sixth. John Lawrence, in 1672, was the seventh. But in 1673, the Dutch retook the colony from the English and reinstalled the burgomasters. In the fall of 1674, the English regained control, and on Nov 10, Nicolls was sworn in, again, this time as New York's eighth mayor.None of this mattered much until the early 20th century, when the city started publishing a numbered list of mayors in the City of New York Official Directory, better known as the Green Book. The book's compilers missed Nicolls' second term, and listed his successor William Dervall as mayor No. 8. The result is that the number of every mayor from Dervall onward was off by one.It took until the 1980s for someone to figure this out. In 1982, a historical editor stumbled upon the missing Minutes of the Mayor's Court for 1674 in the custody of the Manhattan County Clerk, rather than in the office of the City Clerk, where most such records reside.In 1989, based on the recently unearthed information, another historian, Peter Christoph, wrote in the Record of the New York Genealogical and Biographical Society that then-Mayor Ed Koch was actually New York's 106th, not 105th. ""It is a mind-boggling thought: 99 mayors misnumbered - most of them gone to the grave, secure in the knowledge of their place in history, but all of them numerically out of whack,"" he wrote.But no one official paid attention, and the miscount continued through mayor No. 110 (or 111), Eric Adams. This fall, an amateur historian named Paul Hortenstine flagged the mix-up to reporters.So here we are. Mamdani, who initially expressed excitement at the prospect of becoming the city's 111th mayor, now says he will be psyched to become the 112th.","In 1671, Matthias Nicolls was appointed the sixth mayor of New York.

"In San Francisco, a class where 'screenagers' train to navigate social media, AI",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/in-san-francisco-a-class-where-screenagers-train-to-navigate-social-media-ai/articleshow/126198653.cms,"Valerie Ziegler takes digital literacy lesson at a school in San Francisco





Most teenagers know that baseless conspiracy theories, partisan propaganda and artificially generated deepfakes lurk on social media. Valerie Ziegler's students know how to spot them.At Abraham Lincoln High School in San Francisco, she trains her govt, economy and history students to consult a variety of sources, recognise rage-baiting content and consider influencers' motivations. They brainstorm ways to distinguish deepfakes from real footage.Ziegler, 50, is part of a vanguard of California educators racing to prepare students in a rapidly changing online world.Content moderation policies have withered at many social media platforms, making it easier to lie and harder to trust. AI is evolving so quickly, and generating such persuasive content, that even professionals are being stumped.California is ahead of many other states in pushing schools to teach digital literacy, but even there, education officials are not expected to set specific standards until later in 2026. So Ziegler and a growing group of her peers are forging ahead, cobbling together lesson plans from nonprofit groups and updating older coursework to address new technologies, such as AI that powers video apps like Sora.Their methods are hands-on, including classroom exercises that fact-check posts about history on TikTok and explore how badges that appear to signal verification on social media can often be bought rather than earned.Ziegler's efforts showcase the difficulties of keeping pace with new platforms, apps and advances in AI. ""We're sending these kids out into the world, and we're supposed to have provided them skills,"" said the former California teacher of the year. ""The tricky part is that we adults are learning this skill at the same time the kids are.""Social media literacy is a tough subject for schools to try to teach, especially now. Federal funding for education is precarious, and the Trump administration has politicised and penalised the study of disinformation and misinformation.The News Literacy Project, a media education nonprofit, surveyed 1,110 teenagers in May last year and found that 4 in 10 said they had any media literacy instruction in class that year. Eight in 10 said they had come across a conspiracy theory on social media, and many said they were inclined to believe at least one of the narratives.Ziegler teaches the self-described ""screenagers"" that their social media feeds are populated using highly responsive algorithms, and that large followings do not make accounts trustworthy. In one case, students learned to distinguish between a reputable historians group on Instagram and a historical satire account with a similar name. Now, they default to double-checking information that interests them online. ""That's the starting point,"" said Xavier Malizia, 17. Elisha Tuerk-Levy, 18, said it was ""jarring"" to watch a realistic AI video of someone falling off Mt Everest, but added that the visuals in such videos were often too smooth - a useful ""tell"" that helps identify them as fake.Policymakers are paying more attention to the issue. Dr Vivek Murthy, the surgeon general under former President Joe Biden, urged schools in 2023 to set up digital literacy instruction. At least 25 states have approved related legislation, according to an upcoming report from Media Literacy Now, a nonprofit group. Many of the new rules, however, are voluntary, toothless or slow to take effect or do not acknowledge the growing presence of AI.""I absolutely wish we could make things happen faster,"" said California Assembly member Marc Berman, a Democrat who wrote two media literacy bills passed in 2023 and 2024.""It's about really strengthening those foundational skills so that no matter what tech pops up between now and then, young people have the ability to handle it,"" Berman said.","Valerie Ziegler is part of a vanguard of California educators racing to prepare students in a rapidly changing online world.

A Florida man shot and killed his wife, critically wounded his teenage stepdaughter and later took his own life following an alcohol-fuelled argument over an NFL game, authorities said.Polk County Sheriff’s officials said Jason Kenney, 47, became enraged after his wife, Crystal Kenney, asked him to turn off a Monday Night Football broadcast featuring the San Francisco 49ers and the Indianapolis Colts. Investigators said Kenney had been drinking when the argument escalated.During the confrontation, Crystal Kenney told her 12-year-old son to call 911. The boy fled to a neighbour’s home, where he later heard gunshots. Deputies responding to the Lakeland residence found Crystal Kenney dead and her 13-year-old daughter suffering gunshot wounds to the face and shoulder. The girl was rushed to hospital in critical condition but survived and later told investigators she begged Kenney not to shoot her.After the shooting, Kenney fled the scene and contacted a relative, telling her he had “done something bad,” according to authorities.Deputies tracked him to his deceased father’s home in nearby Lake Wales, where he fatally shot himself inside a shed as police attempted to negotiate.Sheriff Grady Judd said investigators recovered a handwritten note from Crystal Kenney urging her husband to seek help for alcohol and drug abuse. Relatives also told deputies that Kenney had a history of physically abusing his wife, though no prior domestic violence calls had been reported from the home.The couple’s other children, including the 12-year-old boy and a one-year-old daughter the couple shared, were unharmed. The surviving children are now in the care of their grandparents. Sheriff’s officials described the case as devastating, calling the teenager’s survival a “Christmas miracle.”","Jason Kenney became enraged after his wife, Crystal Kenney, asked him to turn off a Monday Night Football broadcast featuring the San Francisco 49ers and the Indianapolis Colts.

Trump Greenlights Putin's Role In Israel-Syria Security Deal As Netanyahu Navigates Saudi Backlash





US President Donald Trump has said any peace deal to end the war between Ukraine and Russia will ultimately depend on his approval, casting himself as the final decision-maker ahead of talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Florida.Speaking in an exclusive interview with Politico on Friday, Trump appeared unenthusiastic about Zelenskyy’s latest peace proposal, a revised 20-point framework that the Ukrainian leader is expected to present during their meeting on Sunday.The plan includes ideas such as a demilitarised zone and requests for US security guarantees.“He doesn’t have anything until I approve it,” Trump said, referring to Zelenskyy’s proposal. “So we’ll see what he’s got.”Zelenskyy has said the meeting will focus on key unresolved issues, including security guarantees, control of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and territorial questions surrounding the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine.According to the New York Times, Zelenskyy has described the agenda as broad and said “a lot can be decided before the New Year”.Trump’s remarks underline how dependent Kyiv’s future strategy has become on convincing the US president that Ukraine is prepared to compromise.While Washington has pushed Zelenskyy to soften some of his earlier demands, Russia has largely held to its hardline position and has not publicly responded to the latest proposal, reported Politico.Despite his scepticism, Trump said he expected the talks to be constructive. “I think it’s going to go good with him. I think it’s going to go good with [Vladimir] Putin,” he said, adding that he hopes to speak with the Russian president “soon”.The comments came a day after Zelenskyy held discussions with Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff and the president’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, which the Ukrainian leader later described as a “good conversation”.As per the New York Times, Zelenskyy said those talks produced “good ideas” and new thinking on formats and timelines for pushing diplomacy forward.Zelenskyy’s proposal includes the creation of a demilitarised zone in parts of Donbas still under Ukrainian control, but only if Russia withdraws its forces from a corresponding area in Donetsk.Moscow has shown no sign of accepting anything short of full control of the region, highlighting the wide gap between the two sides.Trump also said Russia was under economic pressure. “Their economy is in tough shape, very tough shape,” he told Politico.During the interview, Trump confirmed that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would also visit him this weekend. “I have Zelenskyy and I have Bibi coming. They’re all coming,” he said.“They respect our country again.” According to an NBC report cited by Politico, Netanyahu is expected to brief Trump on the growing threat from Iran.Trump’s remarks followed US airstrikes against ISIS targets in Nigeria, which he said were delayed by a day for symbolic reasons. “I said, ‘nope, let’s give a Christmas present,’” he told Politico, claiming the strikes had heavily damaged militant camps.As diplomacy continues, Zelenskyy has said Ukraine is ready to show flexibility but warned that if Russia refuses to engage seriously, stronger pressure from the West would be needed to bring the war closer to an end, reported the New York Times.","US President Donald Trump is due to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Florida on Sunday.

‘People will die…’: Elon Musk slams Zohran Mamdani’s appointment of first openly gay FDNY commissioner,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/people-will-die-elon-musk-slams-zohran-mamdanis-appointment-of-first-openly-gay-fdny-commissioner/articleshow/126198316.cms,"Mamdani Distances Himself As NYC Official Quits In Disgrace Over ‘Indefensible’ Anti-Jew Posts





Elon Musk has criticised New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani over his decision to appoint Lillian Bonsignore as commissioner of the Fire Department of New York, warning that the choice could have serious consequences for public safety.Reacting to a news clip announcing the appointment, Musk wrote on social media, “People will die because of this. Proven experience matters when lives are at stake.” The clip highlighted that Bonsignore will become the FDNY’s first openly gay commissioner, a milestone that Mamdani has framed as part of his broader leadership vision.Musk’s criticism focused on the fact that Bonsignore, despite decades of service within the department, has never worked as a firefighter. His comments quickly spread online, intensifying debate over whether top leadership of the FDNY should come from a firefighting background or whether broader emergency management experience is sufficient.Bonsignore is a 31-year veteran of the FDNY who began their career as an emergency medical technician in 1991 and later rose through the ranks to become chief of the department’s emergency medical services.They oversaw EMS operations during the COVID-19 pandemic and retired in 2022. FDNY data shows that EMS units now respond to more than 70 per cent of the department’s emergency calls, a statistic supporters cite as evidence of their extensive operational and administrative experience.Mamdani has described the appointment as historic, noting both the symbolic and practical significance of elevating a long-serving EMS leader to the commissioner role. Supporters argue that the position is primarily managerial, with responsibility for strategy, budgets and coordination across the department, while frontline firefighting decisions are handled by senior uniformed officers with specialised expertise.Critics maintain that leading one of the world’s largest fire departments requires direct firefighting experience, particularly during major fires, large-scale disasters and complex rescue operations. Musk’s remarks have amplified those concerns and pushed the appointment into a wider national discussion about leadership standards, public safety and how political priorities shape senior emergency service roles in New York City.","Elon Musk has criticised New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani over his decision to appoint Lillian Bonsignore as commissioner of the Fire Department of New York.

California’s tech exodus: Entrepreneur warns of a deeper political crisis as tax losses ‘hit $200 billion’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/californias-tech-exodus-entrepreneur-warns-of-a-deeper-political-crisis-as-tax-losses-hit-200-billion/articleshow/126195833.cms,"California’s turning point





How the tax losses add up



A political warning, not just an economic one



Texas and the national reaction

A divided response





Entrepreneur and investor Chamath Palihapitiya has warned that California is facing a deepening political and fiscal crisis as major founders and companies continue to leave the state. In a widely circulated post, Palihapitiya argued that the departures have already cost California tens of billions of dollars in lost tax revenue, with the total potentially rising beyond $200 billion as those businesses expand elsewhere. He linked the losses to what he described as political hostility towards innovation, warning that further exits could weaken the state’s job market and tax base.At the centre of Palihapitiya’s argument is Elon Musk , whose companies Tesla and SpaceX shifted key operations from California to Texas. He traces the roots of that move to tensions during the COVID-19 lockdowns, which he says highlighted a political climate increasingly hostile to major innovators.Palihapitiya pointed to a 2020 social media exchange involving then California Assemblymember Lorena Gonzalez, who used profane language against Musk amid disputes over pandemic restrictions. Musk’s brief reply, “Message received,” has since been cited by critics as a symbol of a broader breakdown between California’s political leadership and its most productive business figures.The $200 billion figure cited by Palihapitiya is an estimate and projection rather than an official state calculation. He argues it reflects the long term impact of lost income taxes, capital gains and corporate growth following the departure of founders and the highly paid employees who moved with them. In his view, the number will continue to rise as Tesla grows and if SpaceX eventually goes public while based outside California.Palihapitiya contrasts this outcome with what he believes California could have achieved by working more collaboratively with innovators. He argues that embracing major employers and founders could have generated hundreds of billions of dollars in tax revenue over time, helping to sustain public finances rather than deepen deficits.Beyond the financial estimates, Palihapitiya frames the issue as a political failure. He accuses California’s leadership of fiscal mismanagement, overspending and a reluctance to conduct meaningful audits or impose spending restraint. According to him, the state’s response to shrinking revenues has been to seek more money from those who remain, rather than reform how public funds are managed.He warns that if the current trajectory continues and more founders and investors leave, California risks losing high value jobs and further weakening its tax base. Without significant reforms, he suggests the state could face severe financial stress within the next decade.Palihapitiya’s comments quickly drew attention from political figures outside California, including Ted Cruz, who echoed the criticism and publicly invited him to relocate to Texas. Cruz framed the moment as evidence of Texas’s appeal as a low tax, business friendly alternative to California’s regulatory environment.Palihapitiya’s response signalled openness to the idea, reinforcing the perception that competition between US states for talent and capital is intensifying.Reaction to the warning has been sharply split. Supporters argue Palihapitiya is highlighting a real and growing problem, pointing to rising costs and company departures as evidence of policy failure. Critics counter that Musk’s move was driven by personal and financial factors that predated any single political incident, and that the fiscal impact is being overstated.What is clear is that the debate over California’s tech exodus has moved beyond individual companies. As founders, investors and politicians continue to clash, the argument has become a broader test of how California balances regulation, taxation and innovation, and what it risks losing if that balance continues to shift.","Entrepreneur and investor Chamath Palihapitiya has warned that California is facing a deepening political and fiscal crisis.

Don't travel even if you don't have any criminal record, valid visa stamp





Immigration attorneys commented on a new trend they have been observing since the beginning of December, that visas are getting revoked without any valid reason. Immigration attorney Rahul Reddy said the new trend is confusing, as people who have, for example, a DUI case 12 years ago and followed all the rules, got the stamping after disclosing everything to the authorities, are suddenly getting their visas revoked for the same 12-year-old DUI.H-1B, H-4, and F-1 visas are being revoked in large numbers.Earlier, revocation used to occur only when new information is found about any individual, like any involvement in fraud or criminal activity that the US admin was not aware of before or when the visa was granted, Reddy explained. ""There is no public statement but visas are getting revoked,"" Reddy said.Immigration attorney Emily Neumann said apart from the State Department's random social media posts reminding everybody that having a visa is a privilege and not a right and it can be revoked any time, there has been no statement from the authorities on why these visas are getting revoked.""These are people who already disclosed all their information. It's not that there's ne information that causes the Department of State to question whether you qualify. They have already determined that these people qualify. In some cases, they even got their visa stamping done during the current Trump administration. But still got their visas revoked. So that tells me this has nothing to do with actual public safety,"" Emily said.Neumann explained that these visa revocations mean nothing unless you leave the US. It doesn't take effect until they leave the US and they will have to go for stamping again and show the same documentsSome NRI groups on social media pointed out that people are getting their visas revoked once they land in India. Several people received the message that their visas had been prudentially revoked when they left the US. It means they can't re-enter the US using the same visa and will have to get a fresh visa interview. All visa interviews in India are randomly deferred as the Department of State has started social media vetting.Both Reddy and Neumann emphasized that H-1B visa holders should avoid traveling outside the US even if they have a valid visa stamping and even if they have no criminal record, because rules are changing every month.

What to do with house and car





As hundreds of Indians are stuck in India over the H-1B stamping delays, a Redditor's question on what to do with a house and car in the US while there is no certainty when one can return to the US has gone viral. The unprecedented situation arose as the US consulates in India deferred the H-1B interviews scheduled in December by at least six months. The cancelations of the interview dates were random and the State Department's new social media vetting was cited as the reason to reduce workload on consulates. January appointments have also been canceled and pushed to November-December 2026.But those who already traveled to India to attend their consulate interviews in December have been in jeopardy as they now can't come back to the US without a valid visa stamping; especially those who do not have any other valid visa to enter the US. Companies are also consulting their attorneys to decide whether these H-1B visa holders should be allowed to work from home.

'When government does medical ...': Elon Musk slams Canadian hospital over death of Indian-origin man allegedly due to neglection,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/when-government-does-medical-elon-musk-slams-canadian-hospital-over-death-of-indian-origin-man-allegedly-due-to-neglection/articleshow/126194729.cms,"



Billionaire Elon Musk slammed a Canadian hospital after an Indian-origin man died due to the negligence of the medical staff.Prashant Sreekumar, 44, a father of three, died after being kept waiting for hours at Grey Nuns Hospital in Canada. In a viral video, Prashant Sreekumar's wife said that the Grey Nuns Community Hospital neglected her husband's condition even after he complained of severe chest pain.Commenting over the viral video, Musk said, ""When the government does medical care, it is about as good as the DMV.""In the video, the wife was heard saying, ""He was brought to Grey Nuns Community Hospital around 12.15 pm. He was sitting in the triage from 12.20 pm onward till about, I would say, 8.50 pm in the night. He was sitting in the triage complaining of constant chest pain. His BP constantly kept on rising, with the last recorded blood pressure of 210. He… he was taken inside. He was only prescribed Tylenol during the entire waiting time that he was outside, and he was not given help. They said that chest pain is not considered an acute problem. They do not suspect a cardiac arrest,” she added.Further, she said that her husband collapsed, while nurses at the hospital were heard saying that they couldn’t feel his pulse.“When we came inside, he was asked to sit down. He got up for a fraction of seconds and he collapsed. He fainted. And the nurse was heard saying that I do not feel a pulse. So basically the hospital administration, the employees of Grey Nuns Hospital, have killed my husband, Prashant Sreekumar, by not providing him timely medical help,” she said.“And the security was so rude that instead of addressing the cause, they said, ‘Ma’am, you are being very rude.’ So basically it is okay for them to kill a human being and to tell the wife that you are being rude,” she added.","Prashant Sreekumar, 44, a father of three, died after being kept waiting for hours at Grey Nuns Hospital in Canada.

Meet Mora Namdar: Trump appoints beauty salon owner to oversee US passport and visa approvals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/meet-mora-namdar-trump-appoints-beauty-salon-owner-to-oversee-us-passport-and-visa-approvals/articleshow/126194936.cms,"Who is Mora Namdar

The beauty salon business

A powerful role in US immigration policy

Links to Project 2025





Donald Trump has appointed Mora Namdar as Assistant Secretary of State for Consular Affairs, placing her in charge of US passport issuance and visa approvals. The role gives Namdar significant authority over who is allowed to enter or remain in the United States, at a time when immigration and travel rules are again a central focus of the administration. While she has prior experience in government, the appointment has attracted attention because Namdar is also the owner of a chain of beauty salons in Texas, an unusual background for one of the State Department’s most powerful operational posts.Mora Namdar is a US attorney and government official who is the daughter of Iranian immigrants and a native of Texas. She is fluent in Persian and has spent years working on US foreign policy, particularly issues related to the Middle East and North Africa. This is not her first time in the consular role. Namdar previously served as acting Assistant Secretary of State for Consular Affairs in 2020 during Trump’s first term, giving her direct experience overseeing visas and passports.Before her latest appointment, she held senior positions within the State Department, including work in the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs, and served in legal and compliance roles at the US Agency for Global Media.Alongside her public service career, she founded and ran her own law firm. In a recent statement, Namdar indicated that the firm is no longer operating in an active capacity, as she focuses fully on her government role.Outside Washington, Namdar is also known as the owner of a mini-chain of beauty salons operating under the name Bam in Texas. The salons offer blowouts, professional makeup services, hair extensions and styling for events. In past interviews, Namdar described the brand as “fun and cheeky” and said the original salon was inspired by friends asking her to do their makeup for weddings and special occasions. She has spoken about wanting to treat beauty and styling as a form of art rather than a routine service.For years, she balanced running the salons with her legal and government work, a combination that has now become a focal point of public discussion following her appointment.As Assistant Secretary of State for Consular Affairs, Namdar oversees one of the most influential bureaus in the State Department. The office handles millions of passport applications annually and plays a central role in deciding who receives, keeps or loses a US visa. Consular officers under her leadership have the authority to deny or revoke visas on grounds ranging from security concerns to foreign policy considerations.In Senate testimony, Namdar has described visa adjudication as a critical national security function, arguing that the US must retain broad discretion to refuse entry to individuals seen as undermining American interests.Namdar has also been linked to Project 2025, a wide-ranging conservative agenda that has influenced Trump’s second term. She contributed to the project by authoring a chapter focused on the US Agency for Global Media, in which she accused the organisation of mismanagement and security risks. She contributed to the project by authoring a section critical of the US Agency for Global Media, accusing it of mismanagement and security risks and calling for major reform or even closure.Although Trump sought to distance himself from Project 2025 during the campaign, many contributors to the initiative have since been appointed to senior roles across the administration, reinforcing the idea that personnel choices are a key mechanism for implementing its priorities.","Mora Namdar is the daughter of Iranian immigrants and a native of Texas.

The Indian-origin doctor whose plans to save lives were undone by Trump’s gutting of USAID,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/the-indian-origin-doctor-whose-plans-to-save-lives-were-undone-by-trumps-gutting-of-usaid/articleshow/126193625.cms,"Donald Trump’s Allegation Of $21 Million USAID Funding For India Elections Debunked By US Embassy





USAID was built to make survival feel ordinary. It existed so that childbirth would not be a gamble, hunger would not quietly hollow out childhoods, and outbreaks would be spotted early enough to remain footnotes rather than funerals. Its work was repetitive and procedural by design, because global health only improves when prevention becomes routine. When the system worked, no one noticed. When it stopped, the damage registered everywhere at once.Atul Gawande understood this logic long before he ever entered government. The Indian-origin surgeon and writer made his career by rejecting medicine’s addiction to heroics and insisting instead on discipline, design, and follow-through. People did not die, he argued, because solutions were missing; they died because systems failed to carry those solutions to the bedside consistently. His famous insistence on checklists, pauses, and enforced communication was not about reducing ambition but about reducing avoidable error. It was a philosophy built for scale.When Gawande was appointed assistant administrator for global health at USAID in 2022, he found himself responsible for a machine that mirrored his beliefs.The agency’s global health division spanned dozens of countries, supporting maternal and child health, infectious disease control, nutrition, and surveillance networks that could identify outbreaks like Ebola or avian flu within days. It was not a laboratory of innovation so much as a factory of follow-through, converting existing medical knowledge into predictable outcomes for people who rarely benefit from predictability.Gawande left the role in early 2025, just before Donald Trump returned to office. The dismantling that followed was swift and destabilising. USAID’s operations were frozen, staff were dismissed, and the bulk of its programmes were terminated or abandoned mid-stream. From the vantage point of Washington, this was framed as reform and reassessment. From the field, it felt like gravity being switched back on.Health systems do not fail theatrically. They erode. Vaccination schedules slip. Supply chains fracture. Outreach workers disappear. Clinics continue to exist in name long after their capacity to intervene has been stripped away. A child with moderate malnutrition becomes severely malnourished because there is no longer anyone tracking the warning signs. A mother arrives too late because the system that once pulled her forward has gone silent. Biology does not pause to negotiate with ideology.Gawande later described the result as a “devastating global health void,” a phrase that captured not shock but absence. What vanished was not just funding, but the connective tissue that allowed fragile health systems to hold. The surveillance that caught outbreaks early. The nutrition programmes that prevented irreversible decline. The institutional memory that allowed progress to accumulate instead of resetting with each political cycle.Rather than retreating into abstraction, Gawande chose to bear witness. He returned to Harvard speaking less like a former official than like a clinician describing organ failure. “It’s not just having a solution; it’s the follow-through,” he said, repeating the principle that had guided his work from operating rooms to refugee camps. He warned that while the agency itself might not be rebuilt in its original form, the scientific and human infrastructure it supported still mattered, and that losing it would not be easily reversible.This is where the story sharpens. The tragedy here is not ignorance or incompetence. It is the deliberate dismantling of a system that worked precisely because it refused to be dramatic. USAID did not save lives through spectacle or ideology. It saved them through consistency. It turned survival into a process rather than a plea.Gawande’s career has been devoted to proving that most deaths are preventable when systems are designed to absorb human fallibility. Watching those systems be broken by political choice exposes a harder truth: progress is fragile not because it is idealistic, but because it is boring, and boredom is easily mistaken for waste.The plans to save lives were already in motion. The mechanisms existed. The outcomes were measurable. What failed was not medicine, or knowledge, or intent, but the willingness to let quiet systems keep doing their work.That is not an ending. That is a warning.","Atul Gawande was appointed assistant administrator for global health at USAID in 2022. The dismantling that followed was swift and destabilising.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan’s nuclear proliferation programme triggered deep concern at the highest levels of the United States and Russia, with both countries expressing that Islamabad’s nuclear activities made them “nervous”, according to newly declassified documents released by the US National Security Archive.The documents, made public this week following a Freedom of Information lawsuit, include verbatim transcripts of meetings and phone calls between former US president George W Bush and Russian president Vladimir Putin between 2001 and 2008. They reveal repeated discussions on Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal, links to Iran’s nuclear programme, and the role of the AQ Khan proliferation network.In a key Oval Office meeting in 2005, Putin raised concerns over evidence suggesting Pakistani-origin uranium had been found in Iranian centrifuges, questioning Western tolerance of Islamabad despite its proliferation record.“But it's not clear what the labs (Iran) have, where they are. Cooperation with Pakistan still exists,” Putin said during the meeting.Bush responded by referring to his discussions with then Pakistani president Pervez Musharraf, saying, “I talked to Musharraf about that. I told him we're worried about transfers to Iran and North Korea. They put AQ Khan in jail, and some of his buddies under house arrest. We want to know what they said.I keep reminding Musharraf of that. Either he's getting nothing, or he's not being forthcoming.”Putin reiterated his concerns, stating, “As far as I understand, they found uranium of Pakistani origin in the centrifuges.”Bush acknowledged the issue, saying, “Yes, the stuff the Iranians forgot to tell the IAEA about. That's a violation.”“It was of Pakistani origin. That makes me nervous,” Putin said, to which Bush replied, “It makes us nervous, too.”Also read: 'I want Pak': Rajnath recalls Vajpayee's unmatched wit; all about iconic moment The documents also highlight Putin’s blunt assessment of Pakistan during an earlier meeting with Bush in Slovenia in 2001. “I am concerned about Pakistan. It is just a junta with nuclear weapons. It is no democracy, yet the West makes no criticism of it. Should talk about it,” Putin said.According to the transcripts, both leaders expressed anxiety about Pakistan’s internal political instability, its military-led governance under Musharraf, and the risk that sensitive nuclear technology could fall into the wrong hands. The discussions repeatedly returned to the AQ Khan network, which was later confirmed to have supplied nuclear technology to Iran, North Korea, and Libya.The declassified records underscore longstanding international concerns about Pakistan’s nuclear command and control systems and the broader implications of its proliferation activities.The revelations come amid renewed scrutiny of Pakistan’s nuclear conduct. Last month, India criticised Islamabad following remarks by US President Donald Trump alleging that Pakistan had been secretly testing nuclear weapons.Reacting to Trump’s comments, Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said such actions were consistent with Pakistan’s history. “Clandestine and illegal nuclear activities are in keeping with Pakistan's history, which is centred around decades of smuggling, export control violations, secret partnerships, AQ Khan network and further proliferation,” he said.“India has always drawn the attention of the international community to these aspects of Pakistan's record,” Jaiswal added."," transcripts of meetings and phone calls between former US president George W Bush and Russian president Vladimir Putin released by US National Security Archive.

Pak PM Sharif's Party Leader Threatens India, Warns Missiles Will Respond If Bangladesh Is Targeted





In a sharp attack on Pakistan’s security establishment, Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman accused the military leadership of employing a “double standard” regarding cross-border military operations. Speaking at a recent gathering in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the influential Deobandi cleric questioned the logical consistency of Pakistan’s defence policy, specifically contrasting Islamabad’s recent strikes in Afghanistan with its diplomatic outrage over Indian activities within Pakistani borders.He asked Pakistan’s military brass why India’s actions inside Pakistan should be condemned when Islamabad justifies strikes in Afghanistan by calling them attacks on its enemies. Rehman argued that if Pakistan claimed a sovereign right to launch pre-emptive or retaliatory strikes against perceived enemies on Afghan soil, it weakened its moral and legal standing when protesting similar actions by India. “We sent militants to Afghanistan for 20 years. .. from giving them Kalashnikovs to Cruise missiles... we empowered them in every way. When you bombed Kabul, it was as if someone had bombed your Islamabad.This is the limit, isn’t it? If you had bombed the remote areas, you might have been able to tolerate it. So, you took some action there as well...”“...If you say, and I have questions, that we have attacked the enemy’s headquarters and you call this a legitimate statement, India says to you that it has attacked Bahawalpur, it has attacked Muridke, it has attacked the headquarters of those who are operating against us in Kashmir. Why are you objecting to this? And if you object to this, and if you have the same claims against Afghanistan, how will you justify it..?”Rehman’s criticism comes at a time when Pakistan’s Field Marshal Asim Munir continues his anti-India rhetoric and claims that Pakistan received “divine help” during the military confrontation with India in May which was felt during the days of intense fighting that followed Indian strikes on terror targets.Rehman’s comments touch upon a sensitive nerve in geopolitics, specifically referring to locations like Bahawalpur and Muridke — areas long identified as hubs for terrorist groups like JeM and LeT — which were decimated during Operation Sindoor. By asking, “Why different rules for India?” Rehman highlighted the strategic hypocrisy: justification of “counterterrorism strikes” in the west, while demanding absolute territorial sanctity in the east.",Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman accused the military leadership of employing a “double standard” regarding cross-border military operations.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan’s chief of defence forces field marshal Asim Munir has claimed that Islamabad received “divine help” during the military confrontation with India in May, while also asking Afghanistan’s Taliban regime to choose between Pakistan and the Tehrik i Taliban Pakistan, PTI reported.Addressing the National Ulema Conference in Islamabad, Munir in a widely circulated video said Pakistan’s armed forces experienced “divine intervention” during the four day conflict triggered after India launched Operation Sindoor. “We felt it,” he said.India carried out Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan occupied Kashmir in retaliation for the Pahalgam attack that killed 26 civilians. The strikes led to intense clashes between the two countries for four days and ended with an understanding to halt military actions on May 10.Meanwhile, Munir warned the Afghan Taliban to choose between Pakistan and the TTP, saying Afghan nationals form the majority of militants infiltrating across the border. “In the TTP formations coming [into Pakistan], 70 per cent are Afghans,” he said. “Is Afghanistan not spilling the blood of our Pakistani children?” He reiterated that Kabul must decide between Pakistan and the TTP.The Field Marshal also said that no one could declare jihad in an Islamic state except the state itself. “No one can issue a fatwa for jihad without the order and permission and will of those vested with the authority,” he said.Munir also drew parallels between Pakistan and the state established by the Prophet 1,400 years ago in the Arab region, now Saudi Arabia.He said that among the world’s 57 Islamic countries, “God gave us the honour of being the protectors of Haramain Sharifain,” referring to Makkah and Madina.Official details of the December 10 address were limited, with selected clips aired later by Pakistani media.","Pakistan’s chief of defence forces field marshal Asim Munir has claimed that Islamabad received ‘divine help’ during the military confrontation with India in May.

According to a post on X summarising a conversation between the PTI founder and his lawyer, Khan instructed Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Sohail Afridi to begin preparations for a mass street movement.In the detailed message shared by his team, Khan said: “To strive for justice is a sacred duty, and I am ready to lay down my life for Haqeeqi Azadi (true freedom) of my nation. At this moment, Pakistan is being governed solely under ‘Asim Law’. Here, verdicts are pre-written and merely announced aloud. Like the baseless decisions and sentences of the past three years, the Toshakhana 2 verdict is nothing new for me. This ruling, too, was delivered in haste, without any evidence and without fulfilling legal requirements.Neither we nor our lawyers were even given opportunity to present our case.”He alleged that both he and Bushra Bibi were being subjected to harsh solitary confinement. “The sustained solitary confinement imposed on me and my wife constitutes severe mental torture. We are barred from books, television, and meetings… The books sent by my family are confiscated by jail authorities, and we are kept in solitary confinement for weeks at a time. This treatment is inhumane, yet all this oppression and brutality cannot weaken my resolve. ”Khan also accused the authorities of persecuting women linked to PTI. “It is not our tradition to target women and children… I am deeply saddened and distressed by the mistreatment and brutality faced by my sisters and other women outside Adiala Jail. The treatment meted out to Bushra Bibi, Dr. Yasmin, Mahrang Baloch, and other women stands in clear violation of Islamic traditions and moral values.”The former prime minister again directed his criticism at army chief Asim Munir . “The army is mine and belongs to the people of Pakistan. When I criticise Asim Munir, it is criticism of an individual… Whatever is happening to me in jail is being carried out on the instructions of a colonel acting under Asim Munir’s orders.”Urging the legal fraternity to mobilise, Khan said: “For the struggle to restore the rule of law and uphold the Constitution, it is essential for the Insaf Lawyers Forum and legal fraternity to step forward decisively.”He added that he had instructed his legal team to appeal the verdict: “I have full confidence in Salman Safdar and his team and have instructed them to file an appeal against these bogus decisions in the Islamabad high court.” Concluding his message, he said: “My message for Sohail Afridi is to prepare for a street movement. The entire nation must rise for their rights!! To strive for justice is a sacred duty, and I am ready to lay down my life for Haqeeqi Azadi (true freedom) of my nation. ”The message was signed off as: “Illegally Incarcerated Former Prime Minister of Pakistan, Imran Khan, speaking to his lawyers after the verdict of a military-style trial in Adiala Jail.”In an official statement, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) described the verdict as “blatantly unconstitutional, illegal, malicious and the worst form of political revenge and a textbook case of victimisation.”The party-led by Imran Khan alleged that the conviction aimed to prolong Khan’s imprisonment and ease pressure on what it called a “petrified ruling clique,” claiming political vendetta was being executed through a “subservient” judiciary.Addressing a press conference alongside senior party leader Asad Qaiser, PTI secretary general Salman Akram Raja said Khan had met his lead counsel, Barrister Salman Safdar, in the courtroom and shared a message for the nation. He quoted Khan as saying, “I am standing firm and resolute and will not seek an apology from anyone, come what may.”Raja added that the case lacked substantive evidence. “They have no witnesses except the person whom the PTI founder himself brought forward,” he said.Heavy police deployment was enforced across Rawalpindi, with more than 1,300 police officers and security personnel stationed at key locations to maintain law and order, after former Imran Khan called for the nationwide protests.","Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, were sentenced to 17 years in prison in the corruption case earlier this week.

PAK Citizens Criticize ""Weak Judiciary"" As Imran Khan’s Prison Term Is Increased

Water crisis deepens public health risks





At least two women were killed and several others injured in Balochistan’s Noshki district after a passenger waggon skidded on a rain-soaked highway and collided with an oncoming truck, Dawn reported. The vehicle was travelling from Quetta to Chagai when the crash occurred near the Sher Jan Agha area.Five passengers sustained injuries, with two shifted to Quetta for critical care. Hospital officials said at least eight people hurt in rain-related incidents were brought to the Civil Hospital.The rainfall, which began on Saturday, ended a prolonged dry spell in the Quetta valley, offering brief relief to drought-hit farmers. However, it also caused widespread disruption. Despite forecasts ruling out significant rainfall, showers intensified by noon, flooding roads, halting traffic and plunging large parts of Quetta into darkness after electricity supplies were suspended. Mobile networks were also disrupted, leaving residents without communication for hours.Low-lying neighbourhoods, particularly areas with mud houses and weak construction, were badly affected as rainwater entered homes.Heavy rainfall was reported across several districts, including Ziarat, Pishin, Kalat, Zhob, Mastung and Sibi, with power outages lasting for hours in many areas.Meanwhile, experts warned that Pakistan’s water-quality crisis is worsening. Speaking at a seminar organised by the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE) in Islamabad, specialists said only 47 per cent of the population has access to safe drinking water, according to The Express Tribune.Dr Hifza Rasheed of the Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources said per capita freshwater availability has dropped from 5,260 cubic metres in 1951 to below 1,000 cubic metres in 2024, placing Pakistan among water-scarce nations. Unsafe water, experts said, accounts for nearly 40 per cent of illnesses nationwide and contributes to tens of thousands of child deaths each year.","A passenger waggon skidded on a rain-soaked highway and collided with an oncoming truck in Balochistan.

Ex-PM Imran Khan And Bushra Bibi Jailed For 17 Years In Toshakhana Gift Jewellery Case





Pakistan’s former Prime Minister Imran Khan has asked his supporters to prepare for nationwide protests and said he will challenge his conviction in the Islamabad High Court after he and his wife, Bushra Bibi, were sentenced to 17 years in prison in the Toshakhana-II corruption case on Saturday.Khan, who does not currently have access to his social media accounts, conveyed his message through his legal team.According to a post on X cited by Dawn, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder said he had instructed Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi to begin preparations for a mass street movement. “I have sent a message to [Khyber Pakhtunkhwa CM] Sohail Afridi to prepare for the street movement. The entire nation will have to rise for its rights,” Khan said.Reacting to the verdict, Khan said the decision did not come as a surprise and accused the court of acting in haste. “Like the baseless decisions and sentences of the last three years, the Toshakhana-II decision is also nothing new to me,” he said, adding that the ruling was delivered “without any evidence” and that his legal team was “not even heard”, as reported by ANI.He confirmed that his lawyers had already been directed to move the high court against the sentence.PTI, in an official statement, described the verdict as “blatantly unconstitutional, illegal” and an act of political victimisation, alleging that the conviction was meant to prolong Khan’s imprisonment.Addressing a press conference, PTI secretary general Salman Akram Raja quoted Khan as saying, “I am standing firm and resolute and will not seek an apology from anyone, come what may.”The case relates to allegations that a Bulgari jewellery set, worth over PKR 71 million and received from the Saudi Crown Prince, was undervalued.Khan and Bushra Bibi were convicted under sections linked to criminal breach of trust and corruption, as per ANI.The sentencing has sparked public debate across Pakistan. Quoted by ANI, residents and journalists in Lahore and Peshawar questioned the credibility of the ruling, with some alleging political motives and a lack of evidence, saying the verdict had further weakened public trust in the justice system and democratic institutions.","Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, were sentenced to 17 years in prison in the Toshakhana-II corruption case on Saturday.

‘Might Never See Him Again’: Imran Khan’s Sons Claim 'Psychological Torture' In Pak's Adiala Jail





NEW DELHI: The Pakistan government on Saturday clarified that there is ""no embargo"" on former prime minister Imran Khan 's sons meeting their incarcerated father if they travel to the country. The government official also said the brothers would be granted Pakistani visas should they wish to come and visit him.The statement came after reports suggested that authorities had imposed unannounced restrictions on visits to Imran Khan, claiming that some visitors were using the meetings to advance political agendas. Following these reports, members of his family and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) expressed concern about the conditions in which he is being held.""There has been no embargo on Suleman Khan and Kasim Khan to meet their father, Imran Khan, at Adiala Jail, Rawalpindi,"" Interior state minister Talal Chaudhry told reporters.Suleman and Kasim, who currently live in London, are Khan’s sons from his first marriage to British TV personality Jemima Goldsmith.Chaudhry’s clarification comes days after the brothers told Sky News they fear they may never see their jailed father again.The brothers said they have not seen or spoken to the PTI founder, imprisoned since August 2023, for months, and voiced concerns about his safety and well-being.“If Suleman and Kasim apply for a Pakistani visa, we will give them. We will not stop them from meeting their father; therefore, the propaganda that the Pakistani government is creating hurdles in the meeting between father and sons should be stopped,” Chaudhry said.He also rejected reports that Khan is being kept in solitary confinement for 23 hours a day.In their interview, the brothers alleged that their father is being held in isolation, calling the conditions “clear torture tactics.”Khan, who has been in jail since August 2023, faces multiple cases filed against him since his ouster from power in April 2022.A United Nations special rapporteur has also warned that Khan is being held in conditions that may amount to inhuman or degrading treatment.In the interview, Kasim claimed Khan is confined to a cell measuring “six feet by eight inches,” barely large enough to stand.“They are not even allowing guards to speak to him because they want total isolation from any other person, just to try and break him. So it’s all very clear torture tactics,” he said.","Suleman and Kasim Khan are Imran Khan's sons from his first marriage.

NEW DELHI: A special court of Pakistan’s Federal Investigation Agency on Saturday sentenced former prime minister and Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf founder Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi to 17 years of imprisonment each in the Toshakhana 2 corruption case, Dawn reported.The court also imposed a fine of Pakistani Rs 16.4 million (INR 52,39,524) on each of them. Failure to pay the fine will result in additional jail time, according to the law.Citing the court order copy, Dawn reported that the sentences took into account Imran Khan’s age and the fact that Bushra Bibi is a woman, resulting in what the court described as a “lenient” punishment. “This court, while passing sentences has considered the old age of Imran Ahmed Khan Niazi, as well as the fact that Bushra Imran Khan is a female. It is in consideration of both said factors that a lenient view has been taken in awarding lesser punishment,” the order said.The verdict was delivered by special judge central Shahrukh Arjumand during a hearing held at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail, where Imran Khan is currently imprisoned.According to Dawn, the case relates to the alleged purchase of an expensive Bulgari jewellery set that was gifted to Imran Khan by the Saudi crown prince during an official visit in May 2021 and later acquired at a throwaway price.Imran Khan was sentenced to a total of 17 years in prison, including 10 years’ rigorous imprisonment under sections 34 and 409 of the Pakistan Penal Code and seven years under Section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act. Bushra Bibi was awarded the same sentence under identical provisions.The court also granted the benefit of Section 382 B of the Criminal Procedure Code, which allows the period of detention already undergone to be considered while awarding the sentence.Following the verdict, lawyers representing Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi said they would challenge the decision before the high court.The two were indicted in the case in December last year. Dawn noted that earlier this year in October, both had denied the allegations, calling the case fabricated and politically motivated.As per Dawn, while recording his statement under Section 342 of the Criminal Procedure Code, Imran Khan rejected the prosecution’s narrative and said the case was “malicious, fabricated, and politically engineered”. He argued that he did not qualify as a public servant under the Pakistan Penal Code and claimed he was unaware of the specific details of the gift, which he said was presented to his wife.Dawn further reported that the PTI founder maintained that due process was followed under the Toshakhana Policy 2018 and that the gift was declared, assessed and legally retained after payment to the national exchequer. “We complied with the Toshakhana Policy in letter and spirit,” he said.","Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi sentenced to 17 years of imprisonment each in corruption case.

Pakistan police on Wednesday registered a case under the Anti-Terrorism Act against the sisters of former prime minister Imran Khan and dozens of his supporters after a protest sit-in outside Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi.The protest on Tuesday was held after authorities refused to allow family members and lawyers to meet Khan, who is currently incarcerated. His sisters, along with leaders and workers of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), staged the sit-in outside the jail to protest the restriction.Police said a first information report (FIR) was lodged at Police Station Saddar Beroni, Rawalpindi, naming Khan’s sisters Aleema Khan and Noreen Niazi, as well as several PTI leaders and supporters. Those named include Salman Akram Raja, Naeem Panjotha, Qasim Khan, Aliya Hamza and Raja Nasir Abbas.Authorities also invoked Section 120 of the Pakistan Penal Code for alleged criminal conspiracy against the state, along with charges of attacking police personnel and violating Section 144.Police said, as reported by PTI, at least 14 suspects were arrested at the scene late Tuesday night, and efforts are continuing to arrest others named in the FIR.Imran Khan has been in jail since August 2023 and faces multiple cases filed after his removal from office in April 2022.Officials have placed restrictions on meetings with Khan, saying such visits are being used for political purposes. The last meeting with him took place on December 2, when his sister Uzma Khan was allowed to see him.","Police register a case against the sisters of former prime minister Imran Khan and dozens of his supporters after a protest sit-in outside Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi.

Survival without transformation





How is Pakistan’s economy still surviving? The question continues to arise as the country grapples with prolonged economic stress despite years of weak growth and low human development indicators.In recent years, Pakistan has dealt with sharp currency swings, runaways inflation between 2022 and 2024, persistent balance-of-payments pressures and mounting external debt burden. Yet the economy has managed to dodge a complete collapse, largely due to repeated bailouts from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and emergency financing from external partners.China has been key to this survival. Chinese loans and infrastructure investments have provided short-term relief but have also deepened Islamabad's financial dependence on Beijing. At the same time, Pakistan has sought to rebuild ties with the United States, long regarded as a key economic and diplomatic backstop.In this outreach, both army chief Asim Munir, now seen as the Pakistan's de facto power centre, and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif have taken apparent steps to engage Washington. The two leaders went ahead to nominate US President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, citing his role in easing military tensions with India.However, New Delhi had turned down the claims of any foreign influence in peaceful agreement with Islamabad in May this year.And Uncle Sam responded with goodwill. Compared to several other countries, it was exempted from steep trade tariffs, with Washington announcing a lower levy of 19%. Trump has also spoken of possible cooperation in developing what he described as ""massive oil reserves"" in Pakistan.The power structure in Pakistan has also been a point of concern in its economic turmoil. The military's expanding role in governance has often overshadowed the civilian leadership, while former prime minister and a popular leader Imran Khan remains in prison, keeping political tensions high and weighing on investor confidence.Neighbouring countries have also added to Pakistan’s economic strain. India’s suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty has emerged as a major setback, while Afghanistan’s Taliban government has announced plans to build dams upstream, moves that could further affect water availability and pose another risk to Pakistan’s economy and GDP growth.For now, Pakistan’s economy continues to function through foreign assistance, administrative controls and short-term stabilisation measures. Without sustained political stability, meaningful reforms and an effective check on corruption, its economic survival remains fragile.One of the most important stabilisers of Pakistan's economy has been the continued support from the International Monetary Fund and other multilateral lenders.The Governance and Corruption Diagnostic Assessment (GCDA) finalised in November 2025, was released ahead of the Fund's executive board's expected approval of a $1.2 billion disbursement, part of the ongoing 37-month, $7 billion programme started under the prime ministership of Shehbaz Sharif.With the latest approval, Pakistan has received around $3.3 billion from the IMF since last year. Under the bailout programme, Islamabad will continue to receive loan instalments over a 37-month period, contingent on meeting the agreed reform conditions.Pakistan narrowly avoided default in 2023 only after the IMF extended an earlier nine-month emergency deal, which was followed by the current longer programme. Since 1958, Pakistan has turned to the IMF 25 times, making it one of the IMF's most frequent borrowers.In 2025, IMF disbursements helped rebuild foreign exchange buffers, reassure markets and finance imports and debt servicing, according to Reuters.Pakistan's central bank has used monetary policy as a tactical tool to stabilise inflation while cautiously supporting growth.On December 15, the State Bank of Pakistan cut its key interest rate by 50 basis points to 10.5%, breaking a four-meeting hold. The SBP said the move was aimed at supporting sustainable economic growth while keeping inflation within target.According to Reuters, all 12 analysts in a Reuters poll had expected the central bank to hold the policy rate at 11%, particularly after the IMF warned against premature easing under Pakistan's $7 billion loan programme.The rate cut highlighted Pakistan's effort to revive domestic economic activity without destabilising the IMF-backed stabilisation framework.Despite underlying weaknesses, Pakistan has seen improving sentiment in financial markets.Credit ratings agencies S&P Global, Fitch and Moody’s upgraded Pakistan’s credit ratings in 2025, citing stronger finances and revenue gains. Investor appetite for Pakistan’s dollar bonds and equities has strengthened, with bonds delivering nearly 22% returns this year and the benchmark stock index gaining 44%, among the best performers in Asia.Bloomberg Economics estimates growth quickened to 3.4% year-on-year in the second quarter, with official data expected shortly.However, with the backdrop of political chaos, most notably the continued imprisonment of the country's most popular political figure, Imran Khan, investors have little confidence to make long-term plans in Pakistan.Pakistan has also moved to rebuild economic ties with the United States.According to Bloomberg, Islamabad is planning an investor conference in Washington to draw American investment in energy, mining and technology. Finance minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said the sectors where Pakistan seeks US investment are clearly identified.Economic links have improved following a new US-Pakistan trade deal setting a 19% tariff, lower than regional peers and well below the 50% tariff imposed on India.Meanwhile, Trump also promised to help Pakistan develop what he described as ""massive oil reserves"" on Pakistani soil. The remarks followed sustained praise and outreach from Pakistan’s de facto power centre, army chief Asim Munir, and were later echoed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who went on to nominate Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize on several occasions.“The first thing was to get the trade equation out of the way, which it is now,” Aurangzeb told Bloomberg.""Every single industry in Pakistan has to have an export component, because it’s the only way we're going to get out of this boom-and-bust cycle,"" Aurangzeb added.Beyond Western partners, Pakistan continues to rely heavily on China.According to the Middle East Institute, Pakistan’s strategic reliance on Beijing has deepened, particularly through the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). In January, Dawn reported that Pakistan and China reaffirmed their commitment to high-quality development of CPEC 2.0, focusing on industrialisation, special economic zones, clean energy, agriculture and livelihood projects.Chinese support has provided Pakistan with infrastructure investment, energy projects and diplomatic backing at moments of economic stress.While IMF financing has stabilised Pakistan, the IMF's own assessment paints a deeply troubling picture of governance in the Islamic Republic.The IMF's Governance and Corruption Diagnostic Assessment concluded that corruption in Pakistan is driven by ""state capture"", where public policy is manipulated to benefit a narrow circle of political and business elites.The 186-page report described dysfunctional institutions unable to enforce the rule of law or protect public resources. Corruption, the IMF said, is persistent and corrosive, distorting markets, eroding public trust and undermining fiscal stability.The report warns that without dismantling entrenched structures of elite privilege, Pakistan’s economic stagnation will persist.According to the IMF, the most economically damaging corruption involves privileged entities that exert influence over key economic sectors, including those owned by or affiliated with the state.Stefan Dercon, a professor of economic policy at the University of Oxford who has advised Pakistan on reforms, told Al Jazeera that lack of accountability continues to erode economic potential.""Failure of implementation [of laws and principles of accountability] gives vested interests too often free rein and addressing this must be at the core of efforts for economic reform,"" Dercon said.Ali Hasanain, associate professor of economics at the Lahore University of Management Sciences, said the IMF’s findings mirror long-standing domestic research.""The IMF diagnostic repeats what many domestic studies, including those by the World Bank and Pakistan’s own institutions, have already emphasised: Powerful interests shape rules to maintain their advantage,"" Hasanain told Al Jazeera.A 2021 UNDP report found that economic privileges granted to Pakistan’s elite, including politicians and the powerful military, amount to roughly 6 percent of GDP.The IMF report also flags governance risks linked to the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), created in June 2023 to promote investment and comprising both civilian and military leaders.The GCDA raises concerns over broad legal immunity granted to SIFC officials and the council’s authority to exempt projects from regulatory requirements.“The recently established Special Investment Facilitation Council, which has been vested with substantial authority to facilitate foreign investments, operates with untested transparency and accountability provisions,” the IMF report said.The Fund urged greater transparency, including annual public reporting on investments facilitated and concessions granted.The World Bank has warned that macroeconomic stabilisation has not translated into meaningful improvements in living standards.""Business as usual is not good for the economy,"" said Mukhtar Ul Hasan, World Bank economist and lead author of a report on Pakistan.""Pakistan's growth potential has been declining for decades"" due to weak competitiveness, limited reforms and recurring crises, he added.The World Bank projects growth of 3% this year and 3.4% next year, far below what is needed to absorb 1.6 million new labour market entrants annually.The Bank’s poverty and resilience report shows poverty rising again to over 27% by 2023–24, with nearly half the population living below the lower-middle-income poverty line. Rural areas, especially Balochistan and interior Sindh, face far greater deprivation.Geopolitics has added new economic risks.After a Pakistan-sponsored terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 civilians, India answered strongly to its misadventure by putting the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance. Islamabad responded by warning that any attempt to stop or divert water flows would be treated as an ""act of war.""Around 80% of Pakistani farms depend on the Indus system, as do nearly all hydropower projects. India had also identified hydropower projects in Jammu and Kashmir that could expand capacity to 12,000 MW from the current 3,360 MW, according to Reuters.In May 2025 India’s crossborder counterterror action under Operation Sindoor, marked a sharp escalation in India-Pakistan security dynamics. Military operations and reciprocal measures elevate defence spending, crowd out development spending, spook investors, and raise insurance and logistics costs for trade.Pakistan suffered a major setback after Indian strikes severely damaged nine of its key airbases, including Nur Khan and Rahim Yar Khan, dealing a significant blow to its military infrastructure.Pakistan’s economic capacity has been heavily drained by sustained military expenditure driven by its adversarial policies toward India, a burden that has come at the cost of investment in social sectors and has pushed the country down across multiple human development indicators.Reports indicate Afghanistan's new dam projects on rivers that feed Pakistan (Kunar/Kabul tributaries) will further diminish cross-border flows into Pakistan’s north-west. Combined with India’s measures, this convergence would be a ""double blast"" to Pakistani water security — concentrated in already drought-prone provinces that supply major agricultural output.Reduced river flows affect irrigation, livelihoods and hydroelectricity; they also fuel internal migration pressures and raise the social cost of adjustment. Regional cooperation mechanisms for water management have weakened, making unilateral upstream development a direct economic shock for downstream Pakistan.Pakistan’s economy is surviving due to IMF support, tactical policy moves, selective foreign investment and geopolitical manoeuvring, including heavy dependence on China and US.But without deep structural reform, dismantling elite privilege and restoring institutional accountability, survival may continue without delivering broad-based prosperity, leaving the country trapped in the same cycle of crisis and rescue that has defined its economic history.","Pakistan narrowly avoided default in 2023 only after the IMF extended an earlier nine-month emergency deal.

Trump Puts Asim Munir On Gaza Test: Can Pak Army Chief Appease U.S & Avoid Backlash At Home?

'Pressure to deliver'

Munir's unprecedented power

Risks at home





Pakistan's de facto state head and most powerful army chief in decades is facing the toughest test of his expanding stronghold in Islamabad power centre as the United States presses Islamabad to send troops to a Gaza stabilisation force, a move analysts told Reuters could spark strong domestic backlash. It could also ""annoy the US president"" if Munir shows disinterest in contributing to the peace plan.Military chief Munir, who holds enormous influenceover Pakistan's political and economic decisions, is expected to travel to Washington in the coming weeks to meet US President Donald Trump . It would be their third meeting in six months and is likely to focus on Pakistan's possible role in Gaza, according to two sources familiar with the matter, one of whom is closely involved in Munir’s economic outreach to the US.Trump's proposed 20-point plan for Gaza calls for troops from Muslim-majority countries to oversee a transition period focused on reconstruction and economic recovery in the Palestinian territory. Gaza has been devastated by more than two years of Israeli military bombardment.Many countries are cautious about joining such a force because it could involve disarming Hamas, Gaza's Islamist militant group. Analysts say this risks pulling foreign troops deeper into the conflict and could inflame pro-Palestinian and anti-Israeli public opinion at home.Munir, however, has developed close ties with Trump as part of an effort to repair years of strained relations between Washington and Islamabad. In June, Trump hosted Munir for a private lunch at the White House — the first time a US president met Pakistan’s army chief alone, without any civilian leaders present.""Not contributing (to the Gaza stabilisation force) could annoy Trump, which is no small matter for a Pakistani state that appears quite keen to remain in his good graces - in great part to secure U.S. investment and security aid,"" said Michael Kugelman, Senior Fellow, South Asia at the Washington-based Atlantic Council.Pakistan is the world's only Muslim-majority country with nuclear weapons and has a powerful, experienced military. It has fought three wars with rival India, a brief conflict earlier this year, and has long battled insurgencies in its remote regions. It is also currently fighting Islamist militants that it says operate from neighbouring Afghanistan.Because of this military capability, expectations are higher for Pakistan to contribute, said defence analyst and author Ayesha Siddiqa.Pakistan’s military strength means ""there is a greater pressure on Munir to deliver his capacity,"" she said.Pakistan’s military, foreign office and information ministry did not respond to Reuters’ questions. The White House also did not reply to a request for comment.Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said last month that Pakistan could consider contributing troops for peacekeeping, but made clear that disarming Hamas was not Islamabad’s responsibility.Earlier this month, Munir was appointed chief of the defence forces, placing the army, air force and navy under his command. He also received a job extension until 2030.Under constitutional amendments passed by Pakistan’s civilian government last month, Munir will retain his field marshal rank for life and enjoy lifetime immunity from criminal prosecution.""Few people in Pakistan enjoy the luxury of being able to take risks more than Munir. He has unbridled power, now constitutionally protected,"" Kugelman said.In recent weeks, Munir has met leaders from Indonesia, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Jordan, Egypt and Qatar, according to military statements. Siddiqa said these meetings appear aimed at consulting Muslim countries on the proposed Gaza force.At home, however, the biggest risk is political unrest. Any deployment of Pakistani troops to Gaza under a US-backed plan could revive protests by Islamist parties that strongly oppose the US and Israel.These groups have the ability to bring thousands of supporters onto the streets.In October, authorities banned a powerful and violent Islamist party known for pushing Pakistan’s strict blasphemy laws. Officials said its leaders were arrested, more than 1,500 supporters detained, and its assets and bank accounts seized. Despite the ban, analysts say the group’s ideology still has influence.Supporters of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan, whose party won the most seats in the 2024 elections, are also deeply hostile to Munir and could mobilise against him.Abdul Basit, Senior Associate Fellow at Singapore’s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, warned that any escalation after deployment could quickly spiral.""People will say 'Asim Munir is doing Israel's bidding' - it will be foolhardy of anyone not to see it coming.""",Pakistan's de facto state head and most powerful army chief in decades is facing the toughest test of his expanding stronghold in Islamabad power centre. Asim Munir is expected to travel to Washington in the coming weeks to meet US President Donald Trump. It would be their third meeting in six months.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126039313,imgsize-900554,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

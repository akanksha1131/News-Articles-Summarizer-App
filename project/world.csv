Foreign aid row: Trump administration seeks Supreme Court intervention to block $12 billion spending; DOJ warns of ‘irreparable costs’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/foreign-aid-row-trump-administration-seeks-supreme-court-intervention-to-block-12-billion-spending-doj-warns-of-irreparable-costs/articleshow/123536455.cms,"Trump administration seeks Supreme Court intervention to block $12 billion foreign aid (Picture credit: AP)

The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to step into a legal battle over foreign aid funds, warning that without intervention, it will be forced to disburse billions of dollars, overriding the administration’s foreign-policy judgments.In an emergency appeal filed Tuesday, the justice department urged the justices to block a lower court order requiring the government to obligate some $12 billion in aid before the fiscal year ends on September 30, according to CNN.Solicitor general John Sauer argued that forcing immediate spending would “inflict irreparable diplomatic costs” and undermine the administration’s authority. “Any lingering dispute about the proper disposition of funds that the President seeks to rescind shortly before they expire should be left to the political branches, not effectively prejudged by the district court,” he wrote, according to Politico.The case stems from US President Donald Trump’s 90-day freeze on foreign aid announced on his inauguration day. As per news agency Reuters, the pause was followed by moves to gut USAID, including sidelining much of its staff and exploring its absorption into the State Department.Two nonprofit groups, AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition and Journalism Development Network, sued, claiming the freeze unlawfully blocked congressionally approved funds earmarked for global health and HIV/AIDS programs.While a three-judge panel of the DC Circuit Court ruled earlier this month that only Congress has standing to challenge spending impoundments under the 1974 Impoundment Control Act, the full court has yet to decide.For now, US District Judge Amir Ali’s order remains in effect, requiring the administration to spend billions by the September deadline. The Trump administration told the justices that the district court has “installed itself as supervisor-in-chief of further spending and rescissions proposals,” as CNN reported.Plaintiffs argue that the freeze jeopardises lives and undermines Congress’s constitutional role.Mitchell Warren, executive director of the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition, said in a statement cited by Politico, “Time and again, this administration has shown their disdain for foreign assistance and a disregard for people’s lives … the question being put to SCOTUS is whether they will be complicit in further eroding the constitutional commitment to checks and balances.”The administration has asked the Supreme Court to issue a ruling by September 2 to avoid what it calls “extensive preliminary steps” to release the funds.The justices narrowly declined to intervene in March, allowing litigation to continue, but the issue is now back before the high court with even greater urgency.","The case stems from US President Donald Trump’s 90-day freeze on foreign aid announced on his inauguration day.

"‘World’s highest dumpster’ gets a fix: $20,000 drones airlift tonnes of trash from Mount Everest — here’s how it works",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/worlds-highest-dumpster-gets-a-fix-20000-drones-airlift-tonnes-of-trash-from-mount-everest-heres-how-it-works/articleshow/123533001.cms,"A ‘revolutionary’ solution

More than just trash

Mount Everest, long revered as the “roof of the world,” has in recent years earned a far less flattering title: the “highest dumpster on Earth.” But this climbing season, a new weapon was deployed against the mountain’s growing waste crisis, heavy-duty drones, AFP reported.At Everest Base Camp, a team of drone operators joined climbers and guides in a mission to haul tonnes of rubbish, from empty cans and plastic bottles to gas canisters and discarded gear, off the slopes. Two DJI FC 30 drones were flown to Camp 1 at 6,065 metres (19,900 feet), airlifting 300 kilograms (660 pounds) of trash down during the spring climbing season.“The only options were helicopters and manpower, with no option in between,” said Raj Bikram Maharjan of Nepal-based Airlift Technology, which spearheaded the project. “So, as a solution, we came up with the concept of using our heavy-lift drone to carry garbage.”The cleanup drive follows a successful trial on nearby Mount Ama Dablam last year, where drones removed 641 kilos of waste. Local officials say the machines are transforming mountain operations.“In just 10 minutes, a drone can carry as much garbage as 10 people would take six hours to carry,” said Tshering Sherpa of the Sagarmatha Pollution Control Committee.Tashi Lhamu Sherpa, vice chairman of the Khumbu Pasang Lhamu municipality, called the project “a revolutionary drive in the mountains to make it cleaner and safer.”Beyond waste removal, drones are now delivering oxygen cylinders, ladders, and ropes across Everest’s perilous Khumbu Icefall, sparing guides and porters from life-threatening treks. “It saves a lot of time and energy,” said record-breaking climber Nima Rinji Sherpa, the youngest to summit all 14 of the world’s highest peaks.Each drone costs around $20,000, provided by Chinese manufacturer DJI, while local authorities help cover operational expenses. Airlift Technology now plans to expand the initiative to Mount Manaslu, the world’s eighth-highest peak.“It’s not just in war that drones are useful,” Maharjan said. “They can save lives and protect the environment. For climate and humanitarian work, this technology is going to be a game changer.”","Two DJI FC 30 drones were flown to Camp 1 at 6,065 metres (19,900 feet), airlifting 300 kilograms (660 pounds) of trash down during the spring climbing season.

'America will lead again in AI': Melania Trump rolls out national challenge for kids — here’s the catch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/america-will-lead-again-in-ai-melania-trump-rolls-out-national-challenge-for-kids-heres-the-catch/articleshow/123529131.cms,"Trump Drama At Vanity Fair? Staff Furious At Proposed Melania Cover, Threaten Mass Resignations

US First Lady Melania Trump is stepping into the tech spotlight, launching a national program to get children thinking about artificial intelligence. But while the initiative comes with lofty promises, it’s short on details, and that’s the catch.On Tuesday, the First Lady’s office announced the President’s Artificial Intelligence Challenge, inviting students from kindergarten through 12th grade to take part. “This will be the first step in preparing our next generation with a base understanding of this important new technology,” Melania said in a statement.In a video posted to her X account, she tied the launch to her personal experience of using AI to produce the audiobook of her memoir Melania. “As someone who created an AI-powered audiobook and championed online safety through the Take It Down Act, I’ve seen firsthand the promise of this powerful technology,” she said. “Just as America once led the world into the skies, we are poised to lead again, this time in the age of AI. ”What the challenge will actually involve, however, remains vague. The announcement offered no specifics on what students will be asked to do, or how the program will be run.Melania, who has no formal background in technology, is also expected to play an undefined role in the initiative.Still, she has shown a growing interest in digital issues. In addition to her AI audiobook, she backed the Take It Down Act, which requires platforms to remove non-consensual intimate images, including AI-generated ones, within two days.Since Donald Trump’s return to the White House, Melania has kept a low profile, spending much of her time in New York where her son Barron is at university. This new initiative marks one of her first high-profile moves in the second Trump presidency, though for now, the details remain as elusive as the technology she’s embracing.","US First Lady Melania Trump is launching a national program to get children thinking about artificial intelligence.

Sioux City stunner: Democrats flip Iowa Senate seat as Catelin Drey defeats Christopher Prosch; GOP supermajority shattered,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/sioux-city-stunner-democrats-flip-iowa-senate-seat-as-catelin-drey-defeats-christopher-prosch-gop-supermajority-shattered/articleshow/123537824.cms,"File photo: Catelin Drey (Picture credit: X)

Iowa Democrats scored a notable win on Tuesday after Catelin Drey, the party’s nominee, defeated Republican Christopher Prosch in a special election for a Sioux City–area state Senate seat, breaking the GOP’s two-thirds supermajority.According to preliminary results reported by county officials, Drey led by nearly 800 votes, or 11 percentage points, with all precincts counted, according to the New York Times.Michelle K Skaff, the auditor and election commissioner in Woodbury County, said only two additional ballots remained outstanding and could be added if received by Wednesday.With this outcome, Democrats will now hold 17 seats in the chamber, compared with 33 for Republicans. The shift strips Republicans of the supermajority that allowed them to confirm Governor Kim Reynolds’ nominees without Democratic support, NBC News reported.The seat was left vacant after Republican Sen. Rocky De Witt, who won the district in 2022, died of cancer in June. Reynolds had called the special election earlier this summer.Drey, who founded the left-leaning policy group Moms for Iowa, campaigned on issues such as affordable child care, gun restrictions, and abortion rights.Prosch, a business owner, had focused his campaign on cutting taxes, opposing “woke ideologies” in schools, and supporting Donald Trump’s immigration policies.National Democrats hailed the result as evidence of growing momentum. “When Democrats organise everywhere, we win everywhere, and today is no exception,” Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin said in a statement, as cited by The New York Times.He argued that voters saw Republicans as a “rubber stamp” for Trump’s agenda and were ready for change.Heather Williams, president of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, called the win a “flashing warning” to the GOP, saying voters were rejecting “the failing MAGA agenda.”The win is Democrats’ second flip in the Iowa Senate this year. In January, Mike Zimmer captured a seat in eastern Iowa in a district that Trump had won by more than 20 points, as per The Hill.While Iowa remains solidly Republican, the GOP controls every statewide office but one and dominates the state legislature, Democrats see these special election victories as signs of renewed energy despite the party’s broader challenges in the region.","Catelin Drey defeated Republican Christopher Prosch in a special election for a Sioux City–area state Senate seat.

Some programmes for black students become 'illegal DEI' under Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/some-programmes-for-black-students-become-illegal-dei-under-trump/articleshow/123536093.cms,"Chicago is a testing ground for some of the Left's biggest ideas about race and education. School systems in the city and nearby suburbs are pushing to hire more Black male teachers, add more Black history and train teachers in concepts like white privilege.Some of those policies have a strong record of improving student learning, while others lack much track record. But for the Trump administration, all of it could be against the law.Now, school districts with programs aimed at lifting up Black students, and others, are finding themselves legally vulnerable. The White House is pursuing a reversal of the federal govt's traditional role on race and schools, going after what it calls ""illegal DEI,"" or diversity, equity and inclusion. The administration is using the Education Department's Office for Civil Rights, which was established to protect racial and ethnic minority groups, to try to end programmes meant to help some of those same students.Through executive orders, investigations and threats to cut funding, govt has put what was once a bipartisan movement to address the legacy of slavery and racism on the defensive. Even Republican-leaning states such as Florida and Mississippi have teacher recruitment programs intended, in part, to diversify the workforce - an idea the administration has called illegal affirmative action.Trump administration lawyers are arguing that when school leaders direct resources to racial groups that remain behind, they discriminate against those that have traditionally been ahead.Nowhere is the potential impact of this reversal starker than in Illinois. The education department has announced civil rights investigations into two of the state's most prominent school systems, in Chicago and in the nearby college town of Evanston, accusing them of breaking the law by focusing school improvement efforts on nonwhite children. Conservatives hope the cases against the two districts will set precedents that can reach into schools and other institutions nationally.Kimberly Hermann, president of Southeastern Legal Foundation, the conservative group that filed a lawsuit and federal complaint against the school district in Evanston, acknowledged that many education leaders believe race-conscious programs will help disadvantaged students. ""Sometimes you can have a noble goal,"" she said, ""but you can't implement it in a way that violates laws.""This fall, Chicago Public Schools will roll out what it calls the Black Student Success Plan. It calls for doubling the number of Black male teachers hired by 2029, reducing disciplinary actions against Black students, adding more Black history and enrolling more Black children in advanced courses.Sarah Parshall Perry, vice president of Defending Education, a conservative legal group that filed a federal complaint against the plan, argued that by focusing so much on Black students, Chicago risked ignoring the needs of other groups, like Hispanic students. Black children make up 34% of the district's students, while Hispanic children account for nearly half. ""I think a lot of these schools are well intentioned but ill advised,"" Perry said. ""In their effort to level the playing field for one specific group, they have failed to account for the needs of all students."" Chicago Public Schools did not respond to questions.",The White House is pursuing a reversal of the federal govt's traditional role on race and schools.

The TOI correspondent from Washington:

In growing signs that the White House is ready to jettison Washington's bipartisan Indo-Pacific policy of supporting India rise as a counterweight to China, MAGA supremo Donald Trump said on Monday that the US will allow Chinese students to come in big numbers to America.Trump said the US is ""going to get along with China"" and asserted that it is going to allow their students to come in, appearing to reverse his administration's position that suspended visas for Chinese graduate students and researchers with ties to its military. The policy led to the revocation of visas for approximately 1,000 Chinese scholars.""We're going to allow their students to come in. It's very important, 600,000 students. But we're going to get along with China,"" Trump told reporters from the Oval Office during a meeting with South Korea's President Lee Jae Myung, even as he warned Beijing of a 200% tariff if it withheld rare earth magnets export to the US. It is not clear where Trump dredged the 600,000 number from since there are currently around 270,000 Chinese students in US. India has more than 300,000 students in the US.Broadly, foreign students from the global south are having to jump through hoops to study in the US now as Trump's MAGA hardliners have launched a campaign against them, saying US universities and corporations use them to undercut wages and deny jobs to native-born Americans.Trump's sudden outreach to Chinese students, who have increasingly been preferring to study at home, triggered an immediate backlash from MAGA hardliners, including those who have been abusing each other.""Nobody, I repeat nobody, wants 600,000 more Chinese 'students' aka Communist spies in the US. China murdered 1.2 million Americans. Now they get to replace us? This cannot happen,"" said MAGA megaphone Laura Loomer, tagging Trump's immigration policy czar Stephen Miller to her post on X. ""We should not let in 600,000 CHINESE students to attend American colleges and universities that may be loyal to the CCP,"" chimed in Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor-Greene.But Trump's pivot seemed to extend beyond the student visa issue as he alternately courted and threatened Beijing to keep an emerging Eurasian grouping in the form of the SCO off balance. During his meeting with South Korean President Lee, Trump said that the US holds ""incredible cards"" in its trade dispute with China, and he could ""destroy"" their economy if he chose to. But he wouldn't - and US would ""get along with China"", he said.","Trump said the US is ""going to get along with China"" and asserted that it is going to allow their students to come in.

Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Big Op Sindoor Lie Claims India Begged For Ceasefire, Trump Stepped In





ISLAMABAD: Nearly 100 days after Indian fighter jets pounded “terror bases” in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), local police said they have arrested a man who allegedly passed on the GPS coordinates of a mosque that was among those hit.The May 6 raids had left the Bilal Mosque in Muzaffarabad badly damaged, with three fatalities reported. Now, PoK police say Obaid Jahangir of Rawalakot “sold out” by sharing its exact GPS location with India over WhatsApp, allegedly for money.Obaid has been booked under the draconian Official Secrets Act, 1923, with police claiming they had recovered “hard evidence” of espionage. “He passed on sensitive images and the mosque’s coordinates in exchange for hefty payments,” claimed SSP Riaz Mughal of PoK police’s counter-terrorism department (CTD).But the case is already mired in conflicting narratives. Another senior CTD officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, went further, alleging Jahangir had a past with a banned outfit before joining a so-called relief organisation. Investigators, he added, had traced communications with Indian handlers on his phone.The family, however, insists Obaid is no militant. His uncle admitted the 30-something may have “fallen into a money trap” but stressed he was only associated with the Jammu Kashmir United Movement, a relief body.“If he is guilty, he should face the law, but he has never been part of any militant outfit,” the uncle maintained.His lawyer, Abdul Samad, pointed out that the sections invoked against him cover trespassing into restricted areas and passing on information “prejudicial to national security”. Conviction under these clauses carries punishments ranging from 14 years in prison to life.Earlier this year, too, PoK police had arrested a police constable on charges of selling sensitive information across the border.","Indian fighter jets pounded ‘terror bases’ in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) Nearly 100 days later, local police said they have arrested a man who allegedly passed on the GPS coordinates of a mosque.

Pakistan blaze: Fireworks warehouse explosion injures at least 25; fire triggers road closures in Karachi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-blaze-fireworks-warehouse-explosion-injures-at-least-25-fire-triggers-road-closures-in-karachi/articleshow/123434002.cms,"



At least 25 people, including some in critical condition, were injured after an explosion took place at a fireworks storage facility in Karachi, Pakistan.Thick smoke could be seen billowing into the sky from the building where firecrackers were stored, according to television footage.Witnesses cited by AP said that broken glass from nearby shops covered the road and panicked residents fled the scene.Firefighters rushed to extinguish the blaze while ambulances ferried the injured, including passers-by, to hospitals.Senior police official Asad Raza said several shops and vehicles on Jinnah Road were damaged in the blast. The cause of the explosion was not immediately known.The fire was reported in a warehouse near Taj Complex on MA Jinnah Road, a Rescue 1122 spokesperson said, adding,“as soon as Rescue 1122’s Central Command and Control team received the information, the Fire and Rescue team reached the scene along with an ambulance and two fire brigade trucks.”Police surgeon Summaiya Syed told Dawn, “Sixteen injured at Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre [with] two critical. Fourteen at Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Trauma Centre,” adding that the warehouse had been storing firecrackers.Karachi traffic police said MA Jinnah Road had been closed due to the fire, with traffic from Numaish being diverted towards Society Signal and Ali Raza Imambargah.Citizens were advised to call the Traffic Police helpline at 1915 for alternate routes “to avoid inconvenience,” the Dawn reported.Sindh CM Murad Ali Shah took notice of the incident and directed officials to control the blaze and ensure no lives were lost. According to a statement, he also ordered the Karachi Commissioner to provide immediate medical assistance to the injured and submit a detailed report. “There is no permission to produce materials near cities or populated areas which can cause damage,” CM Murad was quoted as saying.The Sindh home ministry later issued a statement saying 20 people had been injured in the blaze.Home minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar directed police reinforcements to the scene, saying, “Police reinforcements should be sent to rescue the injured and transfer them quickly to the nearest hospital. An investigation must be completed and a report submitted soon.”Lanjar also instructed investigators to include statements from the injured and evidence from the scene, Dawn furthed added.Explosions at fireworks facilities are not uncommon in Pakistan. In January, six people were killed in a similar blast at a fireworks storage site in Mandi Bahauddin, Punjab province. Fires in commercial and residential buildings are also frequent, largely blamed on poor infrastructure, weak enforcement of safety rules, and negligence.","At least 25 people, including some in critical condition, injured after explosion at fireworks storage facility in Karachi, Pakistan.

"Violence against minorities in Pakistan: Conversions, blasphemy killings on rise",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/violence-against-minorities-in-pakistan-conversions-blasphemy-killings-on-rise-what-human-rights-panel-said/articleshow/123431097.cms,"Forced conversions

Targeting Ahmadiyya community



Blasphemy accusations







The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan has raised alarm over violence against minority communities in the country.HRCP on Thursday released its latest report, Streets of Fear: Freedom of Religion or Belief in 2024/25, documenting violations of freedom of religion or belief (FORB) between 1 July 2024 and 30 June 2025.The report painted a picture as grim as in previous years, recording targeted killings, forced conversions, mob lynchings, hate speech, desecration of places of worship and extrajudicial killings. It also warned that religious freedom in Pakistan is facing an unprecedented threat.The HRCP highlighted several cases where individuals were killed over blasphemy accusations, describing the trend as deeply troubling in a country that has already witnessed the assassination of a provincial governor by his own security guard.The HRCP report noted that the pattern of minor non-Muslim girls disappearing and later resurfacing after allegedly converting to Islam and marrying Muslim men persisted in 2024/25.Hindus in Sindh, who form 8.8% of the population, and Christians in Punjab (1.9%), have raised repeated concerns. A fact-finding study found that forced conversions and coerced marriages remain most prevalent among Scheduled Caste Hindus due to poverty and limited social mobility.The report highlighted the role of cleric-politician Mian Abdul Haq, or Mian Mithu, accused of using his influence to facilitate conversions at his seminary in Ghotki. He was sanctioned by the UK in 2022.The report also cited cases where police were seen siding with abductors, often claiming it would be “haram” to return a girl after conversion.In July 2024, Faisalabad police recovered Christian minor Laiba Suhail, abducted in February and forcibly converted before being married off illegally. Another girl, Alina, is still missing. In January 2025, a Mirpurkhas court heard a plea from a couple accused of forcing an underage Hindu girl to convert and marry.Other cases were reported across provinces: in April 2025, 14-year-old a Hindu girl, Chahat disappeared in Quetta and later claimed in a video to have converted, though her parents produced documents proving she was underage.In May, Hindu Panchayats in Ghotki and Rohri protested the disappearance of a Meghwar teenager in Rohri, fearing abduction for forced conversion. In June, civil society groups and Hindu Panchayats in Larkana expressed concern over three minor girls and a teenage boy from Shahdadpur allegedly being forced to convert.The HRCP stressed that such cases continue to deepen insecurity among religious minorities and called for protective measures to safeguard vulnerable children and their families.The report listed multiple killings of Ahmadis: dentist Zakaur Rahman in Lalamusa (July 2024), Tayyab Ahmad in Rawalpindi (December 2024), Amir Hasan in Naukot (December 2024), Laeeq Cheema lynched in Karachi (April 2025), Muhammad Asif in Kasur (April 2025), and senior doctor Mahmood Sheikh in Sargodha (May 2025).The UN warned, “We are alarmed by ongoing reports of violence and discrimination against the Ahmadiyya community in Pakistan.”“According to the data provided by the Ahmadiyya community, 29 Ahmadi places of worship were attacked and damaged during the review period,” the report said.It further added that in 26 cases, the demolition was carried out by law enforcement agencies.“These incidents occurred in Okara, Khanewal, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Vehari, Sheikhupura, Gujrat, and Sargodha, among other locations Back in January, a historic Sialkot site linked to Pakistan’s first foreign minister Zafarullah Khan was “reduced to rubble”.The report said that the blasphemy law has been often misused to settle personal scores or seek financial gain in Pakistan, where, a ‘mere accusation of blasphemy can be a death sentence.’In September, last year, two men accused of blasphemy were killed while in police custody less than a week apart. One was inexplicably shot and killed in Mirpurkhas during an alleged police encounter, and the other was killed by a police constable inside a police station in Quetta.On 12 September 2024, constable Saad Khan Sarhadi shot dead Abdul Ali, a blasphemy suspect, inside Quetta’s Cantonment Police Station after mobs from religious parties gathered outside demanding his custody. It marked the first such incident in the city where a serving officer killed a suspect in custody. Days later, Ali’s family pardoned Sarhadi, while lawyers and a JUI-F senator pledged legal support for him.Later, on 17 September 2024, Shahnawaz Kunbhar, a civil hospital employee from Umerkot, fled to Karachi after a cleric accused him of posting blasphemous content. He denied the charge in a video message before being arrested by police, who assured his family of protection. Two days later, police claimed he was killed in an encounter, with officers celebrated as heroes.His family was prevented from burying him by armed mobs, and the body was desecrated. Following outrage from rights groups, a Sindh police inquiry declared the encounter “fake.”The report also showed that the mainstream media largely ignored issues of religious freedom under the period covered. Even the Islamabad High Court’s hearings into the “blasphemy business group,” affecting nearly 400 households and livestreamed for four months, drew little coverage. Likewise, cases of coerced marriages, forced conversions and violence against minorities rarely made headlines.A worrying trend has emerged in Pakistan, where ultra-right-wing groups are exerting growing pressure on the judiciary and elected officials through propaganda and intimidation, it added.","The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan has raised alarm over violence against minority communities in the country.

’14 Pakistani Soldiers Killed’: Baloch Rebels Attack Day After India’s Strike On Terror Hubs | Watch





The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for an attack in Panjgur that left four Pakistan 's army personnel dead. According to BLA spokesperson Jeeyand Baloch, fighters launched a raid in the Surdu area of Panjgur on Tuesday night, eliminating a key operative of the Pakistan army.The statement revealed that Ghulam Sarwar had earlier established and commanded a so-called death squad under the protection of the Pakistani military. This squad, which had been active for years in Gichek and other parts of Panjgur, was later led by his son, Islam Sarwar. The group allegedly supported the army's operations, carrying out targeted killings, enforced disappearances, and other violent acts. In return, the army reportedly allowed them to freely engage in drug trafficking, kidnappings for ransom and extortion through road checkpoints.During the operation, BLA fighters seized three Kalashnikov rifles, an M-4, additional weapons, two vehicles, and three motorcycles from Islam Sarwar's hideout. The site, according to the BLA, also served as a torture chamber, where electric shock devices and other tools of abuse were found. Islam Sarwar was accused of abducting and killing a young man in Panjgur just two months earlier. Jeeyand Baloch warned that the Pakistani army and its allies would be held accountable for crimes against the Baloch people.The BLA's latest offensive is part of the ongoing insurgency in Balochistan , where separatist groups are demanding greater autonomy and recognition of Baloch rights. In recent years, attacks on military and paramilitary forces, along with government facilities, have intensified.Separatist factions argue that the Baloch people face systemic marginalisation and exploitation, despite the province's wealth in natural resources. In response, Pakistan's military has pursued counterinsurgency campaigns to suppress the rebellion. However, human rights groups have repeatedly raised concerns over reports of forced disappearances, extrajudicial killings, and excessive force during these operations.Numerous accounts point to the widespread issue of disappearances, with civilians and activists allegedly detained without due legal process. Rights organisations argue that such tactics fuel fear and deepen mistrust, further straining relations between the Pakistani state and the Baloch population.","Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for an attack in Panjgur that left four Pakistan's army personnel dead.

(AP





CHEMMANI: A baby bottle, a squeaky toy and a schoolbag are among items that have surfaced from a mass grave site in Sri Lanka's formerly war-torn northern region, along with 141 human skeletons including some that appear to be of children of different ages.The findings were made at a cremation ground in the Chemmani area near Jaffna town, the cultural heartland of the country's ethnic Tamil minority. But hardly any burials take place here, as Hindus mostly cremate their dead according to religious customs.Excavations have been underway since June, after workers found human remains while digging to build an electric crematorium.A pit test over nine days discovered 19 sets of human remains. Shallow burials of about 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) in a scattered and disorganized manner, and the absence of clothing, indicated the site was a mass grave, according to a report provided to a court in June.Since the area was secured and declared a crime scene that month, a total of 141 skeletons have been discovered within a 165-square-meter (1,776-square-foot) area. About 135 of the bodies had no clothing, and only one set of adult clothing was identified.Tests confirmed that a skeleton found with a schoolbag was that of a girl between 4 and 6 years old. Toddlers' dresses, socks and footwear, tiny bead bangles and a baby powder tray were also recovered.The identities of the dead and the cause and timing of their deaths are all unclear. But many think the victims could be civilians who disappeared during Sri Lanka's civil war, which broke out in 1983 between government forces and ethnic Tamil rebels, who fought to create an independent homeland for the minority group. The war ended in 2009.Several Tamil armed groups and an Indian peacekeeping mission were active in the region over the decades. But attention has focused on the Sri Lankan military, which had a heavy presence for over a decade in Chemmani, as the gateway to Jaffna town.Decades-old confession heightens suspicions A confession made by an army soldier before he was sentenced to death for rape and murder 27 years ago has strengthened suspicions about the site.In 1998, Somaratne Rajapakse along with four alleged accomplices from the military and police were sentenced to death for the gang rape and murder of a schoolgirl and the killing of her mother, brother and a neighbor.The five, who weren't hanged and remain in prison due to a moratorium on executions, have maintained that they were not involved in the rape and murder, but only disposed of the bodies under orders.Rajapakse told the court that he knew where up to 400 bodies were buried in Chammani.""We cannot say exactly who the perpetrators are yet, but the finger points to the (state) army,"" said Brito Fernando, an activist working with the families of people who disappeared during various armed conflicts in Sri Lanka.The area, including the cremation ground, were under Sri Lankan military control from 1996, when it captured Jaffna from the rebels, until after the war ended in 2009. The military operated checkpoints, and anyone who entered or left the area was searched.In 1999, Rajapakse led police to a spot where the schoolgirl, her family and the neighbor were buried and later showed police other places where more remains were found. But the investigations were abruptly stopped.Families want closure Items found at the site were publicly displayed earlier this month in the hope that their owners would be identified, and many people from surrounding villages and beyond visited the site.Amalanathan Mary Calista, whose husband has been missing since 1996 when the military arrested him in their village, said she hoped seeing proof that her husband was dead would bring a sense of closure.""I went there hoping to see at least his clothes. There was a sarong (clothing that wraps around the waist) but it wasn't my husband's. He was wearing a blue sarong at the time. It was disappointing,"" she said.""I only saw the clothing of little children,"" she added, as she wept.She said her husband is among 24 people who never returned home after the military searched their village. Families had tried to block the army vehicles from taking away the detained people, but the authorities pushed them aside with guns and the vehicles sped away, she said.""My wish is that he should be alive and return, but we can do nothing if it is not so,"" she said.""The state army arrested him. They must say that they arrested him and that he died at their hands. They also must pay us compensation,"" she said.Woman recalls military taking her brother and husband away Sivanathan Selvamalar said she watched her younger brother being loaded into a military truck blindfolded during that same raid. Years later, in 2009, her husband was also detained at a checkpoint. He called her to tell her of his arrest and was not heard from again.""We went to see the things, thinking they may have buried people who were arrested around this area, but we saw only the things of little children,"" she said.""We have checked all the prisons but have not found them. When we are told that more than 100 skeletons have been dug out, we fear the worst,"" she added.No children listed in missing person reports A 2003 report by Sri Lanka's Human Rights Commission said it investigated 281 complaints of missing persons from 1990 to 1998. Of these, three were found in prisons and later released, while the rest are still unaccounted for. The report said the military was responsible for 243 cases, while the Tamil Tiger rebels were responsible for 25. The responsibility for 10 others is unknown.No children were listed as missing.Nadesapillai Vithyatharan, the editor of the only newspaper in the region at the time, said several families returned to Jaffna after fleeing into rebel-held territory as the military moved in. Some reportedly went missing after being stopped at checkpoints set up to look for infiltrating rebels, he said.Calls for DNA analysis Although previous investigations stalled, there is hope now that victims will be identified, Fernando said. But he said the government must do more to conduct a credible investigation.""We don't have proper guidelines to investigate the mass graves and have no DNA bank to help with identification,"" said Fernando, adding that the government should fund a DNA bank and enlist international support in the identification of victims.""Only a proper investigation by the government can free its military from suspicion,"" he said.Any direct probe into the military would likely anger Sri Lankan nationalists. Many of the majority ethnic Sinhalese admire the military for winning the civil war.Excavations will continue for 8 more weeks Ground-penetrating radar in other parts of the cremation ground has shown ""soil anomalies ... that are indicative of comparable density of buried skeletal remains,"" according to a report submitted in the Jaffna court last week.The scanned area is three times larger than the site that has been excavated, said Ranitha Gnanarajah, a lawyer monitoring the process. Investigators have requested court approval to continue excavations for eight more weeks, she said.Army spokesman Brig. Waruna Gamage said no one has formally accused the army of responsibility for the mass grave, and if they did they would need to show proof, he said.""The excavations are still ongoing and it is a civil matter belonging to the police and courts,"" Gamage said. ""We will respect the law of the country.""Government forces and the rebels are both accused of committing atrocities amounting to war crimes in the months leading to the end of the civil war in 2009.","A baby bottle, a squeaky toy and a schoolbag are among items that have surfaced from a mass grave site in Sri Lanka's formerly war-torn northern region.

Climate crisis drives displacement





After decades of war, Afghanistan is moving to assert sovereignty over its water resources, a shift that is testing fragile ties with neighbouring countries.Since taking power in 2021, the Taliban have launched large-scale infrastructure projects, including dams and canals, to harness river flows that spill into Iran, Pakistan, and Central Asia.But as per news agency AFP, these efforts are fuelling disputes, with climate change worsening water shortages across the region.The most contentious initiative is the Qosh Tepa canal, a mega-project designed to irrigate 560,000 hectares of farmland in northern Afghanistan. Experts say it could divert up to 21 per cent of the Amu Darya’s flow, a river already vital for water-stressed Central Asian states. Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, backed by Kazakhstan, have raised alarms that the project could further shrink the Aral Sea and destabilise the region’s water-sharing arrangements, which date back to the Soviet era.Water governance specialist Mohd Faizee cautioned and was quoted by AFP as saying, “No matter how friendly the tone is now, at some point there will be consequences for Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan when the canal starts operating.”Taliban officials, however, insist the canal will not cause significant harm. Project manager Sayed Zabihullah Miri was cited by AFP as saying that the Amu Darya has “an abundance of water, especially when it floods and glacial meltwater flows into it”.They argue the project is critical to boosting food security in a country where climate-driven crop failures and humanitarian crises remain widespread.Iran, Afghanistan’s western neighbour, is the only country with a formal water-sharing treaty, signed in 1973 over the Helmand river. But the accord has never been fully honoured. Tehran frequently accuses Kabul of restricting flows through upstream dams, especially during droughts.The Taliban maintain that water scarcity, worsened by climate change, leaves them unable to release more.A report by the Afghanistan Analysts Network noted that Afghan authorities also believe they have long been denied their fair share of Helmand waters due to poor management and political neglect.Meanwhile, disputes also simmer over the Harirud basin, which flows into Iran and Turkmenistan, where Afghanistan recently inaugurated the Pashdan dam. Analysts say reduced security risks after the war could accelerate such projects, reshaping regional water dynamics.To the east, Afghanistan shares the Kabul river basin with Pakistan, which eventually feeds into the Indus. Unlike Iran, no treaty exists between the two neighbours. While water disputes have not dominated their rocky bilateral relations, Kabul’s attempts to revive old river projects and build new ones could trigger friction.Yet, Afghanistan’s financial struggles and lack of technical expertise mean most large-scale projects will take years to complete. This delay may ease immediate diplomatic concerns, but for Afghans grappling with severe water shortages in the capital and beyond, the wait could deepen suffering.Afghanistan’s water disputes cannot be separated from the worsening climate emergency. According to the UN’s International Organisation for Migration (IOM), nearly five million people were affected by floods, droughts, and other climate shocks in early 2025, with almost 400,000 displaced.“Crop failure, dry pastures and vanishing water sources are pushing rural communities to the edge,” the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation warned in July.Villagers in the north were quoted by AFP as saying that they were pinning hopes on the Qosh Tepa canal to revive farming, though its completion is still more than a year away. In contrast, communities in western Herat have watched the Harirud river run dry, forcing families who were deported from Iran to return to barren land with little to farm.Meanwhile, extreme rainfall has added another layer of crisis. Warmer temperatures mean heavier downpours, often triggering devastating flash floods. In Maidan Wardak, a community leader said, “I’m around 54 years old, and we have never experienced problems like this before.”Taliban officials admit their efforts fall short. Energy and water minister Abdul Latif Mansoor recently conceded that while canal and dam projects are underway, “the measures we have taken so far are not enough”.Limited funding, international isolation and restrictive governance have left Afghanistan struggling to cope with climate shocks, even as it faces one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises.For millions of Afghans, everything now comes down to water, too little in times of drought, too much during floods, as the Taliban’s push for control over rivers becomes a defining issue for the country and its neighbours alike.","Afghanistan is moving to assert sovereignty over its water resources, a shift that is testing fragile ties with neighbouring countries.

A United Nations-backed investigator has revealed disturbing evidence of “systemic torture” inside Myanmar’s detention centres, describing electric shocks, strangulations, gang rape and the burning of sexual body parts among the abuses that were documented over the past year.Nicholas Koumjian, head of the international independent team investigating atrocities in the country, spoke as the group released its latest annual report on Tuesday, covering the 12 months to 30 June.The country has been in turmoil since February 2021, ever since the army overthrew Aung San Suu Kyi’s elected government, sparking a civil war. As peaceful protests were crushed with lethal force, those opposing military rule took up arms.Since then, conflict has engulfed large parts of Myanmar.The investigative team, as quoted by AP, said that it had made progress in identifying security personnel involved in detention operations, as well as “perpetrators who have summarily executed captured combatants or civilians accused of being informers.”These perpetrators included members of the security forces, affiliated militias and opposition armed groups.The report details the ""documented torture in Myanmar’s detention facilities which includes beatings, electric shocks, strangulations, gang rape, burning of sexual body parts and other forms of sexual violence,"" according to a summary of the findings.“Our report highlights a continued increase in the frequency and brutality of atrocities committed in Myanmar,” Koumjian said. “We are working towards the day when the perpetrators will have to answer for their actions in a court of law.”“We have uncovered significant evidence, including eyewitness testimony, showing systematic torture in Myanmar detention facilities,” he further added.The team also launched new investigations into atrocities committed in Rakhine state, where the military and the Arakan Army, an opposition force, are battling for control.Rakhine has long been the scene of grave abuses. More than 700,000 people from the Rohingya minority fled to neighbouring Bangladesh in 2017 to escape persecution. About 70,000 more crossed the border last year after the Arakan Army effectively seized control of the territory.The Independent Investigative Mechanism on Myanmar has been operating since 2018 under a mandate from the UN-backed Human Rights Council to document human rights abuses and violations in the country.It has already shared evidence with authorities pursuing cases involving the Rohingya at the International Criminal Court and the UN’s International Court of Justice.","U.N.-backed team releases annual report covering the 12 months to 30 June.

LONDON: Indian nationals in the UK saw the largest increase in sexual offence convictions here of all foreign nationals in the four years from 2021 to 2024, new data shows.There was a 257% increase in convictions of Indian nationals for sexual offences in Britain over the period, followed by Nigerian nationals who saw an increase of 166% and Iraqis (160% increase). Indians were convicted of 100 sexual offences in 2024 compared to 28 in 2021.UK’s ministry of justice (MoJ) said the data relates to sentencing occasions rather than individual offenders.The statistics were taken from MoJ data drawn from the Police National Computer and obtained by the think tank Centre for Migration Control via a freedom of information request to the MoJ.Indians had the third-highest increase in convictions for serious offences of all foreign nationals between 2021 and 2024 at 115%, with the second-highest being Algerian, and the highest being Egyptian. There was a total of 588 convictions of Indian nationals for serious offences in 2024 compared to 273 in 2021.This comes as new immigration data released by the home office shows that in 2024 a total of 293 Indian nationals arrived in the UK illegally via small boat and 206 have arrived between Jan and June this year. Indians are a tiny proportion, though, as the largest cohort last year came from Afghanistan, Iran and Syria.Indians made up 15% of illegal arrivals at UK ports in the year ending June 2025 when there were 5,474 asylum applications made by Indian nationals, of which, rounded to the nearest 100, 4,000 were made by those who had come to the UK on a legal visa, mostly study visas, 400 were made by those who came on small boats, and the rest entered through other means. For asylum initial decisions for Indians, 2,691 were refused in the year ending June 2025, while 20 were granted asylum, and the rest are awaiting a decision.Indians were the largest group to gain citizenship and received the highest number of work visas and tourist visas of any nationality in the year ending June 2025. They were the second-largest cohort to receive study visas with 98,014 visas granted to main applicants.",There was a 257% increase in convictions of Indian nationals for sexual offences.

'I don’t understand Prince Harry’s anger': Butler challenges ‘evil stepmother’ Queen Camilla story — What really happened,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/i-dont-understand-prince-harrys-anger-butler-challenges-evil-stepmother-queen-camilla-story-what-really-happened/articleshow/123525991.cms,"Harry’s Private Note To Late Grandfather Prince Philip Sparks Backlash Online

The simmering tension between Prince Harry and Queen Camilla, long splashed across tabloids, has been reignited, but this time by someone unexpectedly in the middle of royal history. Former royal butler Grant Harrold, who served the monarchy for decades, is challenging the Duke of Sussex’s stark portrayal of his stepmother in his memoir Spare.In the explosive book, Harry branded Camilla “evil” and “wicked,” accusing her of tearing apart the family he cherished with Princess Diana. Yet Harrold’s recollections paint a different picture, one of warmth, laughter, and shared family moments.In his upcoming biography, The Royal Butler: My Remarkable Life of Royal Service, Harrold recounts the day Charles and Camilla wed in April 2005. “Charles and Camilla were catching a flight to head straight to Birkhall. We all went outside to wave them off and laughed as we saw William and Harry had decorated their car with ‘Just Married,’” he writes. He added that the brothers “raced after the car” as the couple drove off “through the arches to cheers,” a scene far removed from the cold animosity Harry described.Harrold insists he witnessed “no animosity” between Harry and Camilla. “The four of them, I promise you, got on so well. I saw them having dinners together, I saw them having drinks together, I saw them going to parties together,” he recalled.He also praised King Charles for his calm demeanor, noting, “He works hard and doesn’t suffer fools… he doesn’t once raise his voice.”A royal insider corroborated Harrold’s account, telling GB News that Harry seemed genuinely happy during the wedding celebrations and even took the lead in decorating his father’s Aston Martin. “I am sure there were mixed emotions over the years, but all I can tell you is how he seemed at the time,” the source said.Yet Harry’s memoir paints a more bitter picture. He claimed Camilla was “dangerous,” accused her of leaking details of his past drug use, and even compared her to the “wicked stepmothers in storybooks.” The stark contrast between Harry’s narrative and those who witnessed the events firsthand has sparked a debate over truth, perception, and memory within the royal family.As Harrold prepares to release his biography, royal watchers are left wondering: did Harry’s version of events obscure a more nuanced reality, or was it a reflection of long-held personal pain?","Former royal butler Grant Harrold is challenging Prince Harry's portrayal of his stepmother in his memoir Spare.

Prince Invites King Charles Amid Hopes Of Reunion

For years, the rift between the royal family and the Sussexes has been the stuff of palace whispers, glossy magazine covers, and endless “sources close to” speculation. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have built a life on the other side of the Atlantic - swapping Buckingham Palace for Montecito mansions, royal duties for media deals, and the London fog for Californian sunshine. But is there a chance the family feud could finally ease? Some royal watchers say the door might just be creaking open.Royal expert Ian Pelham Turner told Fox News Digital that trust remains the sticking point. “I believe it to be totally correct that members of the royal family do not trust Meghan. And of course, she does not trust some members of the royal family in return,” he said.Still, Turner hinted that the narrative isn’t as black-and-white as it seems. “If every member of the royal family doesn’t trust Meghan, then why did King Charles instigate a meeting with his senior advisor and that of Harry and Meghan’s team? Is it all the royal family, or is it perhaps William?”Optimism, however, lingers. Turner hopes Harry, Meghan, and their children—Archie and Lilibet—will eventually be welcomed back “warmly” into the fold. Fellow commentator Ingrid Seward echoed the sentiment, telling Fox News Digital, “I feel that [this] won’t go on forever. I just feel that at some stage… they will begin to come together.”That said, Seward was quick to admit that Meghan remains deeply unpopular with hardcore royalists.The speculation is being fueled further by Harry’s scheduled trip to the UK in September. According to PEOPLE!, he’s set to appear at a charity event for WellChild, which supports children with life-limiting conditions.Whether this visit sparks a reunion with King Charles remains to be seen, but it has reignited questions about the Sussexes’ long-term ties to Britain.One factor pulling them back could be education.Former royal butler Grant Harrold told Style Caster that Harry may want Archie and Lilibet to experience the same schooling system he grew up with. “It’s very likely and it’s completely possible… But then it depends on how the relationship is with the rest of the family when the time comes.”But here’s the royal-sized hurdle: security. In ITV’s Tabloids on Trial, Harry admitted that safety concerns are the main reason Meghan avoids the UK. “They are genuine concerns for me… It's one of the reasons why I won’t bring my wife back to this country,” he said.A source close to him doubled down in Us Weekly: “He’ll always be fond of his home country, but the way he views it, his wife and kids are his priority.”","Royal expert Ian Pelham Turner says trust remains the sticking point.

What the law actually allows

Royal Lodge context (often bundled into the rumors)

Where public opinion sits

What could change in the next reign

A new sovereign could:

Maintain the 2022 limits;

Tighten style/usage via letters patent (e.g., continued non-use of HRH); or

Ask ministers to explore legislation if removing a peerage were desired.

Bottom line

Facts today:

Talk has picked up again about what happens to Prince Andrew’s titles in the next reign. Several outlets claim Prince William wants a tougher line and could look at further steps once he is king. There is no official plan on record; the stories rely on unnamed sources and remain unconfirmed.In January 2022, Buckingham Palace announced that the Duke of York’s military affiliations and royal patronages were returned to the Queen and that he would not undertake public duties; at the same time, briefings confirmed he would no longer use the HRH style in an official capacity. He remains Duke of York and holds no front-line duties. None of that has changed.Speculation says a future King William could try to remove remaining styles and the dukedom itself, and, in some tellings, press for Andrew to leave Royal Lodge. None of this has been announced; it is framed as a possibility, not a decision.A dukedom is a peerage, which is a legal dignity. Removing a peerage requires an Act of Parliament; the House of Lords Library is explicit on this point. The last time Parliament provided a mechanism to strip titles was the Titles Deprivation Act 1917, drafted for wartime enemies, hardly a ready tool for modern scandal.Any fresh action would almost certainly need new legislation.By contrast, styles (like HRH) sit within the sovereign’s power to define by letters patent, hence the 1917 letters patent that limited who is HRH. Using letters patent to refine style/usage is established; using them to annul a peerage would collide with statute and convention. In practice, government-backed legislation is the clean route for removing a dukedom.Prince Andrew holds a 75-year Crown Estate lease on Royal Lodge dating from 2003. Changing his residence would be a landlord-tenant and lease issue, not a simple royal edict. Reporting about pressure to move has see-sawed, but the legal baseline is the lease itself.Recent polling shows strong support for going further: 67% of Britons say Andrew should be stripped of his remaining titles; only 13% are opposed. That mood is real but policy still comes down to law and process.Any move to remove a dukedom would prompt debates on due process, precedent, and where to draw the line for other peers.Andrew does not use HRH, holds no military roles or active patronages, and retains the Duke of York title. Any further step is not something a monarch can do “on a whim”; it would almost certainly require Parliament. Until a legal route exists and is pursued, this remains talk, not policy.","Speculation says a future King William could try to remove remaining styles and the dukedom itself, and press for Andrew to leave Royal Lodge.

A British Airways flight attendant was found naked and high on drugs in an onboard toilet during a flight from California to London. Described as “sweating” and “babbling,” he became agitated and was stood down by the flight’s manager after failing to assist with pre-flight safety checks.A subsequent blood test showed that Haden Pentecost, 41, had both methamphetamine and amphetamines in his system, reported the BBC.After complaining of stomach pain and saying he needed to change clothes, Pentecost locked himself inside a toilet. A colleague later discovered him there and, unaware of his state, before dressing him and moving him to an empty seat, the court heard.A health professional was called after the flight captain spoke to the flight attendant.Pentecost showed dilated pupils and an elevated heart rate, requiring checks every 20 minutes until the flight landed at Heathrow. Paramedics took him to the hospital, where a blood test was conducted.Witnesses described him as incoherent and erratic, muttering meaningless phrases. While reports suggest he had previously been investigated for unspecified conduct, this was his most serious breach yet, as cited by Aviation A2Z.He has since been dismissed by the Airways, and investigations are underway.He appeared at Uxbridge Magistrates’ Court on Friday and pleaded guilty to performing an aviation function while impaired by drugs. The attendant from Basingstoke was granted bail ahead of sentencing at Isleworth Crown Court at a later date.He was reportedly employed by the Airways in 2018.","British Airways flight attendant Haden Pentecost, 41, was found naked and high on drugs in an onboard toilet during a flight from California to London.

"Movement signatures: How we move, gesture, use facial expressions is unique; could be as different as fingerprint",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/movement-signatures-how-we-move-gesture-use-facial-expressions-could-be-as-unique-as-fingerprint/articleshow/123483187.cms,"



MANCHESTER: The way someone walks, talks, smiles, or gestures gives a clue to who they are. Whether through the flick of an eyebrow, the rhythm of our walk, or the tilt of a head, movement speaks volumes.And my recent paper shows that people may have their own movement fingerprint. This is a style of movement that is characteristic of a person's identity. So, someone who uses expressive facial gestures might also speak with animated hand movements or walk with a lively gait. These consistencies could form a motion fingerprint that is unique to the individual.First, let's explore how faces move and why this matters.Everyone has their own style of moving their face, for example, how they raise an eyebrow, purse their lips, or squint when laughing. These patterns of movement help us recognise familiar people even when the visual quality is poor, such as in low lighting or from a distance. And as a person becomes more familiar to us, we become tuned to the way they move, learning their unique patterns of motion, just like we remember their face or voice.Human faces are constantly in motion; they blink, smile, grimace and talk, to name a few movements. Researchers categorise facial motion into rigid movements (such as turning or nodding the head) and non-rigid movements (like expressing emotion or speaking). It's the non-rigid movements that tend to be most personally distinctive.The way we gesture with our hands, shift our posture and tilt our heads all carry identity information. Gestures are often shaped by personal habits or cultural norms; for example, someone might habitually nod three times when agreeing, or use a distinctive hand wave common in their home country.Facial movements are synchronised with the way we sound. When we talk, our face plays a role in shaping the sound of our voice. For example, if you talk with a wide open mouth, your speech sounds deeper and richer. Studies show that people can match other people's voices to moving faces more accurately than to static ones. This suggests that dynamic cues to identity are present in the movement of the face and the sound of the voice.People with face recognition difficulties (those who are ""face blind"" or prosopagnosic) may be better at recognising moving faces than still ones. Typically, people who are face blind can see faces and the differences between them, but struggle to link the face to a specific person. Here, idiosyncratic information from movement can provide an additional clue to identity.Gait, a person's walking style, is one of the most studied body movements. Early research, such as a 2005 study, investigated participants' recognition of identity from gait using point-light displays. In this case, bright spots (lights) were placed on key areas of a person's body. All other visual cues were removed. Participants could only see bright spots against a dark background. The study found participants could tell fairly well who someone was from the way the spots moved.Characteristics such as stride length, limb movement, posture and pace form a consistent motion pattern that is unique and surprisingly difficult to fake, making gait analysis a reliable clue for identifying people.Movement fingerprintsMy review brought together evidence from behavioural and brain imaging studies to consider if such consistencies between different types of motion exist and how we might explore this phenomenon further. The paper proposes that people have an overall style of movement.More work needs to be done to find direct evidence of movement fingerprints. For example, we still aren't sure what part of the brain processes these movement-based identity cues.So far, research shows that the posterior temporal sulcus - an area of the brain located roughly above your ear on each side - responds not just to faces and bodies, but to how someone moves more generally. This area is active when we hear voices or see people speak, suggesting it may help link motion and sound. Also, this region plays a key role in allowing us to understand our social world, interpreting other people's actions, determining where they are looking, and picking up on social cues such as gestures, facial expressions and changes in gaze direction.However, it's probably just one part of a larger brain network involved in recognising others through motion.Real-world applicationsMotion-based identity traits aren't as stable or specific as fingerprints or DNA. They're what researchers call soft biometrics: useful but not always accurate.But as we better understand the link between motion and identity, exciting real-world applications are emerging.Motion analysis could support contactless identity verification from gait-based authentication at airports to gesture-based identification in smart environments, such as homes that respond to a user's unique movement patterns. In clinical settings, movement analysis might help support people with social cognition impairments, face recognition or movement issues. For example, helping a doctor identify changes in the way a patient produces non-verbal cues.But many questions remain. We still aren't sure how consistent motion fingerprints are as someone gets older and in different contexts. Individual differences in people and environmental factors like lighting, clothing or stress could affect them.Researchers also aren't sure how exactly we manage to understand all this movement in everyday life without even thinking about it.Figuring this out could not only help improve technologies like social robots and develop tools for people with recognition and communication difficulties, but also tell us more about how we process and react to other people.

‘Restrict freedom outside jail too’: UK Labour govt cracks down on criminals; offenders may face ban from public venues,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/restrict-freedom-outside-jail-too-uk-labour-govt-cracks-down-on-criminals-offenders-may-face-ban-from-public-venues/articleshow/123481169.cms,"Secretary of state for justice Shabana Mahmood





UK government could introduce new laws to bar Criminals in England and Wales from pubs, sports grounds and concerts under new government plans, aimed at giving judges powers to impose tougher community sentences.Secretary of state for justice Shabana Mahmood said “should remind all offenders that, under this government, crime does not pay.”""I am clear that if you break our laws, for whatever crime, you should lose your liberty – whether you are serving your sentence inside prison, or outside it. That’s why this Government will give courts new powers to hand down tough community sentences that restrict the freedoms of offenders outside of jail too"", Mirror UK reported.The proposals would expand restrictions on offenders’ freedom to include driving limits, travel bans and confinement to specific zones. The rules could also apply to prisoners released on licence, with drug testing extended to all those leaving prison, not only those with prior substance misuse.Currently, judges can impose limited bans linked to specific offences, such as football banning orders for crimes inside stadiums.The new plan would allow such bans to be applied to any offence.“When criminals break society's rules, they must be punished. These new punishments should remind all offenders that crime does not pay,” Mahmood said, stressing that the public expects the government to do “everything in its power to keep Britain safe.”The measures are part of Labour’s wider push to tackle prison overcrowding. In June, the government began transferring inmates to lower security jails to ease pressure on the system.Earlier this month, Sky News reported that the prison system had been close to collapse several times between autumn 2023 and summer 2024. The review pointed to a systemic problem causing recurring capacity crises over the last 18 years.","Proposals would expand restrictions on offenders’ freedom to include driving limits, travel bans and confinement to specific zones.

‘Criminal behaviour’: UK police officer jailed for stealing woman’s underwear during home search; ‘why did he want them’ asks victim,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/criminal-behaviour-uk-police-officer-jailed-for-stealing-womans-underwear-during-home-search-why-did-he-want-them-asks-victim/articleshow/123430737.cms,"Image: X@/vpopulimedia





An on-duty officer who was caught on camera stealing a woman’s underwear during a home search in September last year has been jailed.The officer, identified as Marcin Zielinski, 47, serving with Hertfordshire Police, conducted the Section 32 search.CCTV footage from the woman’s home from last year shows Zielinski slipping a pair of underwear into his back pocket before walking out of the room. The woman released the footage on Monday after the officer was sentenced to four months in prison for the corrupt and improper use of police power and privileges.""Zielinski has let down the public of Hertfordshire, the police service as a whole, and his former colleagues, who act with professionalism and integrity,” Genna Telfer, the assistant chief constable of Hertfordshire Constabulary, was quoted as saying by the BBC.""His criminal behaviour damages the reputation of policing and represents a fundamental betrayal of the public and the values for which the police service stands,"" she said.The woman said she felt so “violated” by the incident that she discarded all her underwear and the chest of drawers, which had become a constant reminder of the distressing footage.“I'm constantly thinking, what did he want them for? Why did he take them? What's he going to do with them? How many more people has he done it to?” the woman was quoted as saying by the Daily Mail.On the night of the incident, the woman was arrested over an unrelated matter but later released without charges. While she was in custody, her partner came across the ring doorbell footage and was shocked by what he witnessed.""On the footage he signals to the other guy, 'I've searched this room, go and search the other room’. So he sent the other officer out and that's when he proceeded to open the drawer and stick them in his back pocket,"" the woman’s partner was quoted as saying by the Daily Mail.The woman feels that Zielinski’s sentence was too lenient and that he should serve a longer term in jail.""Originally I thought it was just going to get a suspended sentence, because I really did not think they were going to take it seriously. But I do think he does deserve to see the law from the other side. He can't just have the power trip to get away with it,"" she said.","Hertfordshire Police officer Marcin Zielinski, 47, was caught on camera stealing a woman's underwear during a home search in September last year.

Key points at a glance

Move to Forest Lodge planned for later this year (property not officially confirmed).

Eight bedrooms, Georgian era, private setting in Windsor Great Park (tennis court, period interiors).

Long-term base: reports suggest they intend to remain there even when William is king.

Funding: rent and renovations to be covered privately.

Other homes: Kensington Palace (work) and Anmer Hall (weekends) remain in use.

Note: There has been no formal public announcement naming Forest Lodge as the future royal residence once William is king. The picture above reflects consistent reporting across multiple outlets and the confirmed plan to move house this year.





Prince William and Kate Middleton plan to move into Forest Lodge in Windsor Great Park later this year. Reports suggest the family intend to keep it as their main home even when William becomes king. There’s no official confirmation of the specific property; Palace aides have only said the Wales family will move house later this year.Forest Lodge is an eight-bedroom Georgian house with the privacy and space the family has not had at Adelaide Cottage. Photos and records show period details inside and a tennis court on the grounds, with a quiet, wooded setting inside the park. People’s interiors coverage has highlighted archived images—fireplaces, Venetian windows and detailed ceilings—from an early-2000s shoot that give a sense of the house’s character.A move before Christmas remains the working assumption if refurbishment keeps pace. Reporting points to a handover before year’s end, but the timing will depend on the house being ready.The choice fits how they live now. The children attend school near Windsor, and Eton College is close for Prince George when the time comes. Staying based in the park keeps school runs simple and daily life steady.There is also a clean-slate feel. The past stretch has been difficult for the wider family.A move to a larger home in the same area offers routine without fresh upheaval.Forest Lodge would mark a shift from old habits. The monarch has long been linked to Buckingham Palace as a primary base. The plan here is different: Prince William and Kate Middleton are expected to keep using London and other palaces for work, while home life stays in Windsor. Ongoing renovation work at Buckingham Palace adds a practical reason to keep the family settled where they are.Money matters appear straightforward. Coverage says the couple will fund rent and current renovations privately, drawing on William’s income from the Duchy of Cornwall. The goal is a family home first, with formal spaces available when needed.They will still hold on to other places. Kensington Palace remains their London base for duties. Anmer Hall in Norfolk stays as a country retreat. Forest Lodge would sit at the center of that small triangle.Practical details are still emerging. Reports describe a preference for limited live-in staff and separate quarters for their longtime nanny—consistent with the low-key way they have run the household in recent years. The property is large enough to place security and help at a distance from family rooms.The move is not yet complete. Work on the house continues, and any relocation would also require arrangements typical for residences on Crown land. The family will make the switch when it is ready. If the plan holds, Forest Lodge becomes the anchor now and in the future, while official palaces remain the stage for state work. The idea is simple: keep the children’s routines intact and handle the Crown’s business where it belongs.","Prince William and Kate Middleton plan to move into Forest Lodge in Windsor Great Park later this year.

Britain agrees to drop mandate for Apple to provide 'back door',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/britain-agrees-to-drop-mandate-for-apple-to-provide-back-door/articleshow/123395824.cms,"Representative Image





SAN FRANCISCO: The Trump administration has reached an agreement with Britain to spare Apple from a request that the company create a tool to give British law enforcement organisations access to customers' cloud data.Tulsi Gabbard, US director of national intelligence, said Monday night that Britain had ""agreed to drop its mandate for Apple to provide a 'back door' that would have enabled access to the protected encrypted data of American citizens and encroached on our civil liberties.""Britain's decision to back off the policy comes after Apple spent months lobbying officials in Washington and rolled back an encrypted storage feature for British users. In the face of govt pressure around the world, the company has been resolute that it won't create a back door that allows access to phones or encrypted user data because it is afraid such a tool could be abused.Much of Apple's predicament in Britain played out in private after the govt issued a secret order this year. The request came after Britain amended its Investigatory Powers Act of 2016, which allows it to compel companies to turn over data and communications to law enforcement and intelligence agencies.Apple helped make the secret order public by declaring in Feb that iPhone users in Britain would begin seeing messages on their phones saying the company no longer offered its Advanced Data Protection feature. The capability, which remained available in the US, had allowed British users to encrypt almost all of their iCloud data, including messages,notes, photos and backups.Gabbard said Britain's agreement would ""ensure Americans' private data remains private and our Constitutional rights and civil liberties are protected."" nyt",Britain dropped a request for Apple to create a tool to give law enforcement access to customers' cloud data.

Royal Navy gets its first Hindu chaplain,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/royal-navy-gets-its-first-hindu-chaplain/articleshow/123394957.cms,"The UK's Royal Navy has appointed Bhanu Attri as its first-ever Hindu chaplain. (PTI Photo)





LONDON: A pandit raised in India has become the Royal Navy’s first ever Hindu chaplain.Bhanu Attri (39), who grew up in Himachal Pradesh but now lives in Essex, formally passed out of Britannia Royal Naval College in Dartmouth last week and is also the Royal Navy’s first non-Christian chaplain.He was one of two chaplains and 148 new Royal Navy officers to pass out.Chaplains offer religious, pastoral, welfare and moral support to any member of the naval service, regardless of faith, who need it either at a base, or on ships and submarines. Attri, a Hindu priest with decades of experience running a Hindu temple in London, will also offer Hindu prayer ceremonies for Hindus.There are around 40 Hindu personnel serving full-time in the Royal Navy, plus another 30 in the Maritime Reserves. In the UK military, as a whole, there are more than 1,550 Hindus serving full-time, mostly in the army.Whilst most cadets underwent 29 weeks of training, he underwent a slightly different 13-week course: six weeks of officer instruction, which included learning about the Royal Navy’s worldwide role, its present-day mission, and how to survive a sinking ship; four weeks at sea, and three weeks focused on the role of a military chaplain.Bhanu will now join the chaplaincy at HMS Drake, serving the thousands of personnel working in and around Devonport Naval Base, ashore and at sea.“Passing out from Britannia Royal Naval College to become the first ever Hindu chaplain in the fleet is a profound honour,” Attri said. “The chance to represent individuals from other diverse religions brings meaningful representation for the Hindu community and reflects the Navy’s commitment to diversity, inclusion, and spiritual care for all. My family feels immense pride.”Anil Bhanot, Hindu adviser to the ministry of defence (MoD), said: “In 2023 the Royal Navy created a position for a Hindu chaplain and I endorsed Pandit Bhanu Prakash Attri for best fitting the criteria. He has qualifications from India equivalent to a Sanskrit scriptural postgraduate degree.” Bhanot said he wanted to encourage more Hindu youth to join the British armed forces.“Although our spiritual Bhoomi is India, our Karma-Bhoomi is the UK and MoD represents our protective arm,” he said.","Bhanu Attri (39), who grew up in Himachal Pradesh but now lives in Essex, formally passed out of Britannia Royal Naval College in Dartmouth last week.

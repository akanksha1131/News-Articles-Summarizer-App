"Masked thief who stole DHS chief Kristi Noem’s Gucci $4,400 purse, cash, passport caught in DC heist: Report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/masked-thief-who-stole-dhs-chief-kristi-noems-4400-gucci-purse-3000-cash-passport-keys-to-her-apartment-caught-in-brazen-dc-heist-sources/articleshow/120659432.cms,"Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's Purse Stolen at Restaurant

The masked bandit who broke into a DC restaurant and made off with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem 's expensive Gucci purse, filled with thousands of dollars in cash, confidential government documents, and her DHS badge, has been caught, sources said Saturday, reported the New York Post.Noem, 53, was out celebrating Easter family dinner at The Capital Burger, a mile from the White House, when the slick heist took place on April 20. Her designer Gucci shoulder bag, slung carelessly at her feet, was stolen in a matter of seconds by a hooded thief with a surgical mask and a ball cap, a theft right out of a movie script.""It was kind of shocking, actually, because it was sitting right by my feet. I actually felt my purse — he hooked with his foot and drug it a few steps away and dropped a coat over it and took it,"" Noem said afterward in an interview with podcaster Vince Coglianese.At first, Noem said she thought it was just her grandkids kicking her under the table. ""But it was very professionally done,"" she said. ""It tells me that this happens all the time to people, and that they live in communities where this is a danger, and it reaffirms why I’m here.""Within the purloined fashion bag was a haul worthy of a thriller bestseller. $3,000 in cash, her driver's license, passport, DHS badge, and keys to her apartment. Also resting within the bag was a $600 Louis Vuitton Clemence wallet, the police report said, according to the Post.Security camera footage caught the thief in the act. A white male with dark-colored pants and a ""fur-type"" collar, scanning the crowded restaurant with his eyes. He nervously pushed the bag under his coat and rushed out the door, disappearing into the streets of DC before Noem or anyone else even knew what was happening.Sources indicate the suspect, whose name has not been released, is connected to a larger East Coast robbery gang that deals in high-end thefts. Authorities estimate at least two individuals were involved in Noem's robbery, one of whom is said to be a migrant. The second suspect is still at large.The suspect is set to make his initial court appearance early next week.Noem's protection squad, the Secret Service that looks after her under her cabinet rank as she guards Homeland Security, Customs and Border Protection, as well as the Coast Guard, was involved during the arrest as well as that of the DC Metro Police. Noem's bodyguards were indeed present within the restaurant, even though their proximity to the burglary is in dispute.Investigations remain to be seen whether Noem was targeted due to her authoritative position, or the act was just an opportunistic crime. Noem herself is leaving it to law enforcement to find out.The arrest represents a significant milestone in what authorities believe is part of a larger trend of brazen, organized crimes on the East Coast, with high-profile targets such as Noem now in their sights.As the hunt for the second suspect continues, federal authorities are piecing together how deep the operations of this robbery crew might be.","Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's Gucci purse was stolen from a DC restaurant.

Cardinals congregate in Rome to elect new Pope after death of Francis at 88: Who they are and what they do,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/cardinals-congregate-in-rome-to-elect-new-pope-after-death-of-francis-at-88-who-they-are-and-what-they-do/articleshow/120659396.cms,"High dignitaries of the Catholic Church

The Pope-makers

Created, not named

The importance of Cardinal Red

A political appointment

Declining privileges

Cardinals from all over the world have begun convening in Rome to prepare to hold a conclave to select a successor for Pope Francis , who passed away on Monday at the age of 88. As the Catholic Church stands at a pivotal transition, eyes turn to the men who will eventually select its new leader — but what is a cardinal, anyway?A cardinal, from the Latin cardinalis, meaning ""principal"", is one of the top officials of the Catholic Church, appointed by the pope to help govern. Most of the important dicasteries, the equivalent of government ministries within the Vatican, are led by cardinals. They have the official title of ""Cardinal of the Holy Roman Church.""Organized into the College of Cardinals , they have a dean — now the 91-year-old Italian Giovanni Battista Re — and constitute the pinnacle of Catholic leadership. Although cardinal is a title more than a defined position, a majority of cardinals are bishops stationed in various parts of the world, and some reside in Rome, exercising important posts within the Curia, the Church's central government.Of the 252 cardinals that exist today, only those below the age of 80, or ""cardinal electors,"" are actually allowed to cast a vote for a new pope. There are 135 such electors.The conclave is convened within the Sistine Chapel where the election happens under strict ceremonial and secrecy that has not greatly changed over the centuries. Once the cardinals have finished conducting the mourning ceremonies for Francis, the conclave will commence.Cardinals are not appointed; they are ""created"" by a unique papal bull. The word, derived from Roman usage, means that the recipient is promoted in rank because of his individual merits, not because he is assigned to an empty office.Under Vatican regulations, the pope may create cardinals from among men who are ""truly outstanding in doctrine, virtue, piety and prudence in practical matters.""Cardinals can be identified easily by their scarlet red vestments — a color formerly emblematic of the power of the Roman Senate, now symbolizing the blood of Christ and readiness to die for the Church.They have a sapphire ring, a pectoral cross, a crosier (a ceremonial staff), and a mitre (a ceremonial headdress) as part of their formal wear.The appointment of cardinals is not only a religious choice but also a very political one. Each pope exercises his appointing power to determine the future of the Church.Pope Francis significantly increased the College of Cardinals by appointing men from the ""peripheries"" — areas historically underrepresented by Rome — in order to make the Church more representative of the global, worldwide nature of Catholicism and to influence the election of his successor.In spite of their standing, the privileges cardinals once took for granted have been progressively eroded. Cardinals — who are formally addressed as ""Eminence"" — are just below the pope and can say Mass in any church outside Rome. They also have the right to be interred inside churches.But dramatic changes started coming into effect after the Second Vatican Council, which took away cardinals' indulgences like private train compartments and throne rooms in their houses.Pope Francis took it a step further: in 2021, he directed a reduction in cardinals' salaries to compensate for losses incurred due to the coronavirus pandemic, and in 2023, he abolished the tradition of providing them rent-free apartments within Vatican City.As the world observes Rome, attention has shifted to these influential leaders — who they are, how they were selected, and how they will define the next chapter of the Catholic Church.","A cardinal is one of the top officials of the Catholic Church, appointed by the pope to help govern.

Comedian Bill Maher torches US President Donald Trump after private dinner: 'Flirting with dictatorship doesn’t stay flirting',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/comedian-bill-maher-torches-us-president-donald-trump-after-private-dinner-flirting-with-dictatorship-doesnt-stay-flirting/articleshow/120659201.cms,"Weeks after enjoying a surprisingly gracious dinner with Donald Trump , comedian Bill Maher unleashed a scathing critique of the former president, accusing him of ""flirting with authoritarianism "" and warning that dictator jokes don't remain jokes for long.“Trump is the only president when you’re relieved when he doesn’t keep his campaign promises,” Maher joked, drawing a big laugh from the crowd.Maher specifically took issue with Trump's past remarks about staying in office beyond two terms, despite the constitutional ban under the 22nd Amendment , and his line about being a dictator ""only on Day One.""“That’s the problem with dictator jokes. They don’t stay jokes. And flirting with authoritarianism doesn’t stay flirting,” Maher warned.The comedian painted a vivid analogy to relationship cheating. “I’m telling you, humans cannot be trusted to just flirt with other attractive humans, and the MAGA crowd cannot be trusted to flirt with dictatorship,” he argued. “Not everyone who flirts cheats. But all cheating starts with flirting.”Maher, who was a vociferous Trump critic during his time in the White House, has been unexpectedly supported by some conservatives and libertarians of late for his public denunciations of ""wokeness."" But on Friday, he made it clear that his dinner meeting with Trump wouldn't silence him from decrying what he perceives as grave dangers.Earlier on Real Time with Bill Maher 's Friday show, the host began by confirming his end-of-March dinner with Trump, brokered after rock star Kid Rock urged the sit-down. Maher reported that the dinner was proof he could be objective, confessing, ""Everything I’ve not liked about him was, I swear to God, absent."" But Maher soon fell back into old habits, cautioning his viewers that Trump's public demeanor is another matter.""I've gotten some s–t from the loony left for just reporting, honestly, how the president responded in private when I was criticizing him to his face,"" Maher said. ""I was truthful about it. And that gives me standing to say to conservatives, 'Now okay, you enjoyed my honesty and balls, now I want to see your balls,'"" he joked. ""What I mean is — it's your turn.""Even after their temporary peace for dinner, Maher indicated there's no cease-fire in sight: he continues to view Trump as perilously close to full-blown authoritarianism, and he's not joking.","Maher was a vociferous Trump critic during his time in the White House.

""This is against the Quran and Sunnah and threatens the religious identity of Muslims,"" said secretary general Ahmad Abdul Quader.Hefazat's warning came during nationwide protests triggered by the Commission's recent report, which Hefazat claims goes against Islamic law . Speaking at a protest site in Narayanganj on Friday, Hefazat joint secretary general Mamunul Haque said, ""We welcomed five of the six reform commissions, but the proposals from the Women's Affairs Reform Commission are shocking. They blame religious and social norms for gender discrimination, which is a clear rejection of Islamic law.""

Steve Bannon says Trump would get a third term easily if he does this,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/steve-bannon-says-trump-would-get-a-third-term-easily-if-he-does-this/articleshow/120652923.cms,"Steve Bannon says Trump has many options to run for president again in 2028.

President Donald Trump's former adviser Steve Bannon said the Constitution that bars one from being the president more than twice can't stop Trump from serving a third term if he starts millionaire tax that would tax the rich but would help him. “This is being fought behind closed doors right now, and I’m telling you, with the massive tax cut, in addition, he’s going to give the working class and the middle class, the math only works out if you actually increase taxes on the wealthy,” the former Trump adviser said on NewsNation suggesting that a system where the rich takes care of the middle class would sustain Trump in power.“The Democrats never raised taxes on oligarchs, never raised taxes on Wall Street, never took away carried interest. The Democratic Party is absolutely beholden to the billionaires, the oligarchs,” Bannon said. “Trump’s the only person ever stood for the working class.”“And this, this massive tax cut, which the Democrats never did, to take the attacks away from a Social Security, take tax away from tips, take tax away from overtime for working class people, is the first time that the working class has got an additional tax cut from everybody else, and Trump’s fighting for that,” he argued.Trump for 2028 sounds like an impossible idea but has been reinforced time and again with a little push from the president himself, as he is not dismissing the talks but providing a little fuel. His organization came up with Trump 2028 hats and T-shirts this week as he asserted he is serious about running for president in 2028 too.""No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once,"" says the 22nd Amendment.But an easy shortcut is to run for the vice president in 2018 with JD Vance running for president. If they win, JD Vance can step down making way for the vice president to become the president.In an interview with TIME magazine published on Friday, Trump said there are ""some loopholes that have been discussed"" to allow him to serve a third term. However, he said he does not ""believe in using loopholes.""On being directly asked whether he would run as a running mate to JD Vance in 2028, he said, ""I don’t know anything about, what, look, all I can say is this, I am being inundated with requests. I'm doing a good job. Great physical exam, and unlike every other president, I took the cognitive test and I aced it 100% and I bet you guys couldn't get 100% on that exam. It's a tough exam. You know, when you get into the mid questions, it gets to be pretty tricky and pretty tough, and the last questions are very tough, and I aced it. And I guarantee, I'd give you, I'd make a big, beautiful bet that you guys couldn't ace it. But anyway. But look, it's good to have you, it’s a very nasty interview. They don’t ask any of the good things.""","Bannon said the Constitution that bars one from being the president more than twice can't stop Trump from serving a third term if he starts millionaire tax that would tax the rich but would help him. “The Democratic Party is absolutely beholden to the billionaires, the oligarchs,” he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120652924,imgsize-26150,width-400,resizemode-4/Steve-Bannon-says-Trump-has-many-options-to-run-for-president-again-in-2028-.jpg"
What recent polls say about Donald Trump's approval ratings,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-recent-polls-say-about-donald-trumps-approval-ratings/articleshow/120653906.cms,"Donald Trump's approval rates are falling, according to all recent polls.

Men are not supporting Trump any more



President Donald Trump's approval ratings have reached an all-time low after his tariff war against countries and this is the unanimous outcome of all recent polling, the latest being the New York Times/Sienna College one which gave Trump an approval rating of 42 per cent. 54 per cent said they disapproved of his job performance, putting him 12 points underwater in net approval.Trump’s approval rating is considerably lower than the rating for other recent presidents nearly 100 days into their administrations.Trump has a net negative approval rating on a wide range of issues pollsters asked respondents about, including immigration and the economy — the two issues that had consistently been seen as his strengths since the start of his first term, the NYT poll said. The poll was conducted April 21-24 among 913 registered voters. The margin of error was 3.8 points.One of the major takeaways from these recent polling is that Trump's approval rating with men is turning sour. According to a Pew Research poll, conducted between April 7-13 among 3,589 Americans, Trump's approval among men has dropped from a net positive in February (52 per cent approve, 46 per cent disapprove) to a net negative in April (44 per cent approve, 55 per cent disapprove). That represents a 17-point swing in a matter of months. The latest poll had a margin of error of +/- 1.8 percentage points.The latest Economist/YouGov poll, conducted between April 19-22 among 1,625 respondents, shows Trump at 45 percent approval and 49 percent disapproval among male respondents—down from 55/40 just a month earlier. That represents a 19-point net drop in just four weeks. Both polls had a margin of error of +/- 3.3 percentage points.A Fox News poll, conducted between April 18-21 among 1,104 registered voters, found male support at 48/51, down from a breakeven 50/50 split in March.","The latest New York Times/Sienna College poll gave Trump an approval rating of 42 per cent, putting him 12 points underwater in net approval.

""When lies catch up to you there's no way out,"" she posted on her Instagram story, leaving no room for any doubt that the words were meant for Guiffre as she shared her death news post and added his comment.Later, she backtracked from the comment and made another post saying she would pause her posts on the topic as suicide is tragic.“I have taken the decision to pause my posts on Virginia Giuffre at this time.

Playing neutral or free hand to India?: Teasing out Trump's post-Pahalgam comment,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/playing-neutral-or-free-hand-to-india-teasing-out-trumps-post-pahalgam-comment/articleshow/120651012.cms,"Donald Trump

TOI correspondent from Washington:

What exactly did US President Donald Trump mean when he said India and Pakistan will ""figure it out one way or the other"" in the aftermath of the Pahalgam terrorist attack ? One reading is that Trump is treading a neutral path, not wishing to take sides in a clash rooted in history, of which he appears to only have a vague idea. Another interpretation: he is giving India a free hand to do what it deems necessary.At the best of times, the MAGA supremo is not known for his clarity of thought or expression. Mangled syntax, jumbled words, and incomplete sentences, are par for course. Even so, his comments on Friday about the India-Pak situation left analysts scratching their heads, including his references to the fight over Kashmir and tensions on the border ""going on for a thousand years or even longer...1500 years.""This is what Trump said when asked about the tensions: ""I am very close to India and I'm very close to Pakistan, and they've had that fight for a thousand years in Kashmir. Kashmir has been going on for a thousand years, probably longer than that. That was a bad one (terrorist attack). There have been tensions on that border for 1,500 years. It's been the same, but I am sure they'll figure it out one way or the other. I know both leaders. There's great tension between Pakistan and India, but there always has been.""The charitable explanation from Trump supporters is that the US President was speaking only figuratively to convey that Hindu-majority India and Muslim Pakistan have been at loggerheads for a long time, viewed through the lens of religion. They have to sort it out between themselves and there is little that the US can do.Even an online group called United Hindu Council agreed with the reading, noting that Trump was ""hinting at a much deeper history — and he's quite right..he pointed at the centuries-old religious fault lines caused due to Islamist extremism — that have deeply scarred Kashmir’s history and continue to fuel violence today.""But a more nuanced reading by some experts is that Trump is giving India a free hand to ""sort out"" Pakistan, a reading that is strengthened when one considers his ""I'll leave Bangladesh to the prime minister (Modi)"" remark during the latter's recent visit to Washington in February when he was asked about the regime change in Dhaka. Previously too he has suggested it is up to India to manage the Pakistan situation.The ""free hand to India"" interpretation of Trump's latest comment is endorsed among others by Christine Fair, a long-time South Asia analyst, whose extensive work on the region includes deep insights into Pakistan's use of terrorist as an instrument of state policy. ""That's the right message to send even if by accident. Why should the US bail out Pakistan by trying to restrain India? Pakistan has to be taught a lesson...by India,"" she noted in a post on X.Taking a cue from the President, even the State Department, which in the past typically rushed out comments asking both sides to exercise restraint, has remained largely silent. Remarkably, Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Friday posted a photo of a peace treaty engineered by Washington between Congo and Rwanda, even as Trump was fulminating about Russia and Ukraine.""Big news coming out of Africa, where I am also involved in settling violent wars and conflicts,"" Trump boasted though about the Congo-Rwanda treaty, before lamenting, ""I don’t know why so many of these events have fallen to me and my Administration, but they have, and we have done an unprecedented job in getting them SETTLED or, putting them in position for PEACE.""No word though about what Washington had often described in the past as a ""nuclear flashpoint,"" in recognition of what has long been a Pakistan gambit to invite US intervention. Other than -- ""they'll figure it out one way or the other.""","US President Donald Trump said India and Pakistan will ""figure it out one way or the other"" in aftermath of Pahalgam terrorist attack. One reading is that Trump is treading a neutral path, not wishing to take sides in a clash rooted in history. Another interpretation: he is giving India a free hand to do what it deems necessary.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120651043,imgsize-1231718,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

Hubris Maximus

'I know how ruthless he is'



'Elon Musk cannot stand being told what to do'



A new book on Elon Musk , published this week, has revealed that a young Musk told an investor 30 years ago that he is the 'reincarnation' of Greek conqueror Alexander the Great. It was at a lunch that Derek Proudian , then at Mohr Davidow Ventures, met a young Musk 30 years ago. The moot point was bankrolling Musk's first startup Zip2 which aimed to bring the Yellow Pages online. Musk told him Zip2 was going to be the biggest company ever.“No—you don’t understand,"" Mus said. “I’m the reincarnation of the spirit of Alexander the Great.”Proudian was not willing to give any importance to what young Musk was saying but Musk kept on saying that he had got the samurai spirit. “I’ve got the samurai spirit,” he said. “I’d rather commit seppuku than fail,"" the book titledby Washington Post's Faiz Siddiqui says, as reported by The Daily Beast.Proudian said in the book he did not take the words of 23-year-old Musk seriously but now that he looks back he knows how smart he is and how ruthless he is. “I am really concerned because I know how smart this guy is and I know how much money he has and I know how ruthless he is, and it’s playing out in front of my own eyes,” he said.Ross Gerber, a former Tesla investor and one of the company’s biggest cheerleaders, told Siddiqui that Musk cannot stand being told what to do—even by the Securities and Exchange Commission. “He just basically has a complete disdain for any authority period,” said Gerber, whose relationship with Musk eventually soured. “I have a completely different opinion about the hubris of thumbing your nose at the people that could really hurt you.”The book has details of the time when Musk bought Twitter for $44 billion in 2022. When he called the executives for a meeting, it was bizarre. ""One high-level exec recalled waiting for 90 minutes outside of Musk’s office. When he was finally allowed to enter, Musk was watching a YouTube video on his phone. There ensued an awkward 10 minutes of silence during which the executive waited for Musk to acknowledge his presence,"" the Daily Beast report narrated.Siddiqui wrote how whenever he tried to reach Musk for a story, Musk would invariably say ""Give my regards to your puppetmaster,"" referring to Post's owner Jeff Bezos.","A new book on Elon Musk has revealed that a young Musk told an investor 30 years ago that he is the'reincarnation' of Greek conqueror Alexander the Great.

Columbia University student and pro-Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil whose arrest sent shockwaves among university students in the country was detained without an arrest warrant, the Donald Trump administration admitted to the court. It cited exigent circumstances for the warrantless arrest and said there was a flight risk. Mahmoud Khalik said he would not cooperate and intended to leave the scene,the immigration authorities said.Khalil, a Syria-born legal US resident with a green card, was arrested March 8 after he returned from an Iftar meal during Ramadan. Video footage of the arrest shows Khalil cooperating and telling officers, ""Yes, I'm coming with you.""DHS argued in court documents submitted to the court Thursday that it did not need to obtain a warrant before the arrest because immigration officers have the power to detain people where there is suspicion of “an offense against the United States.”""The HSI [Homeland Security Investigations] supervisory agent believed there was a flight risk and arrest was necessary,"" the DHS wrote. ""The agents had reason to believe that the respondent was likely to escape before a warrant could be obtained,"" it continued.Khalil’s attorneys, however, argue DHS did need a warrant to enter their client's apartment building. Khalil's legal team is calling for the case to be dismissed, claiming that he cooperated with authorities throughout the arrest and that no evidence has been presented to prove he was a flight risk.""We learned for the first time that the DHS agents who arrested Mahmoud lied to him: they wrote in their arrest report that the agents told him that they had an arrest warrant, but DHS has now admitted in their filing that that was a lie and that there was no warrant at all at the time of the arrest,"" Marc Van Der Hout, one of Khalil’s attorneys, said in a statement.Khalil's wife Noor Abdalla gave birth to their first son in New York while Khalil remains in ICE detention in Louisiana. ""I welcomed our son into the world earlier today without Mahmoud by my side. Despite our request for ICE to allow Mahmoud to attend the birth, they denied his temporary release to meet our son. This was a purposeful decision by ICE to make me, Mahmoud, and our son suffer,"" Khalil's wife said in a statement issued on April 21.","Trump administration admitted to court that Mahmoud Khalil was detained without a warrant.

Grace Without Grandstanding

The Anti-Influencer in an Influencer Age

Politics, Without Losing the Plot

The Long Game

When the Vances landed in India this week, the itinerary looked textbook: meet the Prime Minister, pose at the Taj Mahal, sprinkle in a few cultural references for good measure. Standard fare for visiting dignitaries, performed thousands of times before.But what unfolded was something very different — a subtle masterclass in cultural diplomacy , and at the heart of it was Usha Vance .In a political era dominated by noise, posturing, and performative outrage, Usha Vance’s quiet, unassuming presence achieved what armies of spin doctors and PR consultants usually fail to do: she connected.And in doing so, she drew comparisons to the gold standard of American charm offensives abroad — Jackie Kennedy in Paris, 1961.The most telling moment of the trip came not from a prepared speech or a state dinner, but a simple, almost instinctive gesture.As JD Vance spoke at Jaipur’s cultural centre, he stumbled on a pronunciation and turned, mid-speech, to ask his wife, ""Did I pronounce that right, honey?""It wasn’t a rhetorical line. It wasn’t crafted for the cameras.It was something rarer: a moment of natural intimacy, trust, and authenticity.In that moment, Usha Vance wasn’t just a spouse. She was an anchor — the confidante without whom the Vice President himself seemed adrift.It was also a preview of the trip's underlying reality: JD Vance may have held the title, but Usha Vance held the stage.Much like Jackie Kennedy’s visit to Paris six decades ago, Usha Vance’s presence rewrote the mood of the trip. Jackie enchanted the French not with policy pronouncements, but by embodying a vision of America that was cultured, refined, and impossibly elegant.Usha Vance, too, projected an America many Indians still admire — one where success is earned, roots are honoured, and dignity does not have to be loud to be powerful. She did it without flowing designer gowns or staged glamour shots. She wore practical flats, let her grey streaks show, and stepped into interviews in the same outfit she wore sightseeing. She didn't “represent” India — she understood it, because it was part of her own story. In doing so, she touched something deeper than policy: cultural memory.At a time when every political figure is expected to be a personal brand — hashtags, filters, inspirational quotes ready for algorithmic distribution — Usha Vance's refusal to participate in the theatre made her stand out even more. She didn’t document every meal or pose for TikTok challenges.She wasn’t selling a story — she was the story: the Indian-American daughter of immigrants, navigating two worlds with an ease that felt both effortless and earned. And when the Vance children turned up in traditional Indian attire, it didn’t feel like a photo-op. It felt like a homecoming. This was soft power , not shouted from podiums but whispered through generations.Usha Vance's journey is, inevitably, a political one.Once a registered Democrat, now standing comfortably by the side of a Vice President aligned with Trump-era nationalism, her transformation unsettles many.How does someone who knows the immigrant struggle, who thrived in the meritocratic grind of Yale Law School, reconcile herself with MAGA politics?The answer lies partly in personal loyalty — to her husband, to her own experiences.But it also speaks to something larger: the refusal to be reduced to a demographic stereotype.In India, these contradictions weren’t interrogated. They were understood.India knows that identity isn’t always linear. That tradition and modernity, loyalty and ambition, rootlessness and belonging can — and often must — coexist.Unlike most American second ladies, Usha Vance is only just beginning to shape her public persona.She has hired a small team. A portfolio of issues — likely revolving around family, education, and immigration — is in the works.For now, though, she has kept her focus squarely on being a mother, a wife, and, when required, a reluctant public figure.It is precisely this restraint that gives her such quiet power.When she finally does step forward with initiatives of her own, she will bring to them the most precious political currency of all: credibility.Not manufactured. Not focus-grouped.Lived.When Jackie Kennedy left Paris, Charles de Gaulle famously remarked, ""I do not know how successful the President was, but I do know the First Lady conquered Paris."" If there is a modern parallel, it was written this week, somewhere between the crowded streets of Jaipur and the sunlit marble of the Taj Mahal. JD Vance was the Vice President on official duty. But it was Usha Vance who conquered India. Not with grand gestures. Not with rehearsed slogans. But simply by embodying a version of America — and India — that feels timeless and aspirational. In a world often weighed down by spectacle and cynicism, Usha Vance offered something rarer: a quiet grace that both nations could recognise — and celebrate — as their own.","Usha Vance's quiet, unassuming presence achieved what armies of spin doctors and PR consultants usually fail to do: she connected. In doing so, she drew comparisons to the gold standard of American charm offensives abroad — Jackie Kennedy in Paris, 1961.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120648592,imgsize-80230,width-400,resizemode-4/Jackie-Kennedy-and-the-Vances.jpg"

'Jung karni hai to...': How Pakistanis are trolling themselves on social media,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/jung-karni-hai-to-how-pakistanis-are-trolling-themselves-on-social-media/articleshow/120622600.cms,"After the Pahalgam massacre—where terrorists from Pakistan crossed the border and executed 26 people in cold blood—the usual geopolitical script began to unfold. India condemned, Pakistan denied, and the West reached for its thesaurus of euphemisms : “gunmen,” “militants,” “insurgents.” But something unusual happened this time. The sharpest rebuke didn’t come from New Delhi or Washington. It came from within Pakistan itself.Not from TV anchors or ministers. But from everyday Pakistanis—with Wi-Fi in one hand, rage in the other, and no illusions left to break.Take this tweet: “Jung karni ho to 9 baje se pehle kar lena, 9:15 per gas chali jati hai hamari.”Translation: If you're planning a war, please do it before 9am—we run out of gas after that.It would be hilarious if it weren’t heartbreakingly accurate. Pakistan, a nuclear power, can’t guarantee a cup of tea in the morning.Another tweet offered mock-condolences: “People of Karachi, Faisalabad, Multan, Islamabad—we are sorry.”A citizen apologising not for terrorism—but for governance. Or the lack of it.This isn’t your everyday political frustration. This is something more profound. More fatalistic. What we're witnessing is post-collapse satire—not born from resistance, but from resignation. Not defiance, but detachment. Pakistanis aren’t mocking their military, politicians, or failing institutions because they’re angry. They're doing it because there's nothing left to do but laugh.The timing of this public self-roast is revealing. Pakistan has once again been implicated in a cross-border terrorist attack. The victims were targeted for their religion. The attackers were affiliated with Lashkar-e-Taiba ’s proxy, The Resistance Front. And while the world watched, Pakistanis didn’t take to the streets to support their “freedom fighters.” They didn’t protest Indian foreign policy. They turned inward—and began roasting the very state that enabled this tragedy.Not because they were suddenly overcome with guilt. But because they’ve understood what the world still struggles to say aloud:The real victim of Pakistan’s obsession with jihad isn’t India. It’s Pakistanis themselves.Their fuel. Their food. Their currency. Their safety. Their dignity.All sacrificed at the altar of “strategic depth.”While generals polish their medals and issue denials, the public boils with a mix of exhaustion and clarity. There’s no electricity. Gas is rationed like contraband. Inflation hovers at 30%. The rupee is in freefall. The government runs on loans. And when Pakistan was supposed to host the ICC Champions Trophy, India refused to show up—forcing Pakistan to play on neutral ground in Dubai. The punchline wrote itself: even Pakistan can’t host itself without a connecting flight.This level of civic self-awareness would have once been dangerous. A decade ago, a sarcastic tweet could get you disappeared. Today, the dam has broken. Not because the state has grown tolerant—but because the people have grown numb. The rot is no longer underground. It’s trending on X.If memes are the last resort of a powerless populace, then Pakistanis are now full-time philosophers. Their humour is bleak, their metaphors are postmodern, and their sarcasm is indistinguishable from sadness. This is not the comedy of rebellion. This is the comedy of collapse.After Pahalgam, the rest of the world looked at Pakistan with suspicion. But for once, Pakistanis looked inward—and they laughed. Not because they didn’t care. But because they’ve stopped pretending that anything will change. The state has lost the plot. The people have rewritten it as dark comedy.And so, in the aftermath of yet another tragedy, it wasn’t India that needed to respond. The loudest condemnation came from within Pakistan. Not through op-eds or diplomatic cables, but through memes, tweets, and deadpan jokes. The only thing that still functions on time in Pakistan today is the punchline.They mocked their inability to keep the lights on. Their dependence on bailouts. Their cricketing humiliations. Their rulers. Their uniforms.It was gallows humour in a gaslit republic.Albert Camus would’ve called it freedom—the moment you stop asking why and simply push the boulder again. That’s the Sisyphus Clause.India, despite all its flaws, still chases Jefferson’s promise of happiness—through growth, dissent, and democracy.Pakistan? It has stopped expecting anything. And in that quiet surrender, it has turned its citizens into jesters, philosophers, and unwilling realists.They don’t protest anymore. They don’t revolt. They meme. Because in Pakistan, even tragedy comes with load-shedding. And the only thing that ever arrives on time… is the joke.","After the Pahalgam massacre, Pakistanis turned inward and began roasting the very state that enabled this tragedy.

COLOMBO: Sri Lanka's catholic church says the Vatican has named 167 of its faithful killed in Islamic State-inspired suicide bombings six years ago as witnesses of faith.Hundreds, including Christian, Buddhist, Hindu and Islamic religious figures, attended a vigil Monday in memory of the victims at the church of St. Anthony, targeted in the attacks.Archbishop of Colombo, Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, told the attendees Cardinal Marcello Semeraro, prefect of the Dicastery for the Causes of Saints in the Vatican, has included the names of 167 catholics who died in the bombings in the churches of St. Anthony in Colombo and St. Sebastian in Negombo ""in the catalogue of the witnesses of the faith in its order book, considering the context of their heroism.""He said they were chosen ""due to violent opposition to their faith motivated by 'odium fidei,' the hate of the faith."" Ranjith also said seven victims of other faiths were ""respectfully remembered.""Witnesses of faith are those who sacrificed their lives for their belief. Pope Francis formalized in 2023 a new category of recognition by the church of people who lost their lives while professing the catholic faith and created a special Vatican commission to catalogue their cases. The commission, based in the Vatican's saint-making office, has gathered hundreds of cases, with a view to highlighting them alongside officially recognized martyrs of the church, who are on the path to possible beatification or sainthood.More than 260 people, including 42 foreigners, were killed in the near-simultaneous bombings during Easter Sunday at three tourist hotels and three churches, two Catholic and one Protestant, on April 21, 2019.The catholic church in Sri Lanka has demanded further probing in the attacks, particularly after British television Channel 4 interviewed a man who said that he arranged a meeting between a local IS-inspired group, National Thowheed Jamath, and a top state intelligence official to hatch a plot to create insecurity in Sri Lanka and enable former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to win the presidential election later that year.","Sri Lanka's catholic church says the Vatican has named 167 of its faithful killed in Islamic State-inspired suicide bombings six years ago as witnesses of faith.

An earthquake of magnitude 5.8 on the Richter scale struck Afghanistan on Saturday at 12:17pm (IST), the National Center for Seismology confirmed. The tremors were felt in several parts of northern India, including Delhi-NCR and Jammu & Kashmir.A resident in Srinagar said, “I felt the tremor. I was in the office when my chair shook,” describing the momentary panic triggered by the quake.Though no immediate reports of damage or casualties have surfaced in India, authorities are monitoring the situation closely.Pakistan too experienced seismic activity earlier in the day, with the National Seismic Monitoring Centre reporting a 5.9 magnitude earthquake at 11:47am (local time). The epicentre was located near the Afghanistan-Tajikistan border region at a depth of 94 kilometres.Tremors were widely felt across Pakistan, including in Islamabad, Lahore, Rawalpindi, Peshawar, and several regions of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa such as Lower Dir, Bajaur, Malakand, Nowshera, Dir Bala, Shabqadar, and Mohmand, sparking panic among residents. However, no loss of life or property has been reported so far.This marks the second earthquake in the region within a week. A 5.5 magnitude quake had previously struck Pakistan’s capital and parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab provinces last Saturday.Pakistan remains highly vulnerable to seismic activity, with the 2005 earthquake being the deadliest in recent memory, claiming over 74,000 lives.","An earthquake of magnitude 5.8 on the Richter scale struck Afghanistan on Saturday at 12:17pm (IST) The tremors were felt in several parts of northern India, including Delhi-NCR and Jammu & Kashmir.

A gunman opened fire at a church in Sri Lanka’s Manampitiya village on Friday evening, raising safety concerns just days ahead of the country’s Easter Monday commemorations for the victims of the 2019 Easter bombings.While no injuries were reported, the shooting damaged a church window, triggering a swift police investigation.The incident occurred around 7 pm (local time) at the Living Christ Church located at Ayurveda Place, Manampitiya, approximately 160 kilometres northeast of the capital, Colombo.As per a police statement cited by news agency AFP, “Initial investigations suggest that the suspect had targeted the church due to a personal enmity with the pastor.”The suspect, identified as a 38-year-old resident of Main Road, Manampitiya, was arrested after police received a tip-off and launched a search operation, reported Daily Mirror Sri Lanka.A locally-made firearm believed to have been used in the shooting was recovered from his possession.According to eyewitness accounts gathered during the preliminary investigation, the man approached the church gate, appearing to assess the area, then returned to the road and fired a single shot before fleeing.Police are continuing their probe into the incident.The attack comes as Sri Lanka remains on high alert during the Easter season. Armed police and military personnel have been deployed to nearly all churches across the island, especially with this year marking six years since the Easter Sunday bombings of 2019 that killed 279 people, including 45 foreigners.Over 500 others were wounded in the coordinated suicide attacks on three churches and three hotels.This year, the Catholic Church is set to formally honour the bombing victims as ""Heroes of the Faith"" in a special memorial on Monday.However, many within the Church continue to express frustration over what they say is a lack of accountability and transparency. As per AFP, the Church has repeatedly accused successive Sri Lankan governments of shielding those with links to the bombers. High-level investigations in the past have suggested ties between military intelligence units and those responsible for the attacks.","A gunman opened fire at a church in Sri Lanka’s Manampitiya village on Friday evening.

Met Police are investigating Pak diplomat's throat-slitting gesture directed at Indian-origin protesters in London,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/met-police-are-investigating-pak-diplomats-throat-slitting-gesture-directed-at-indian-origin-protesters-in-london/articleshow/120653027.cms,"(ANI photo)

TOI Correspondent from London:

The Metropolitan Police here is investigating a macabre throat-slitting gesture made on Friday night by Colonel Taimur, army and air adviser at the Pakistan high commission in London, which was directed towards Indian-origin protesters angry about the Pahalgam terror attack.The Indian diaspora had gone to the Pakistan high commission to protest against who they believe are the perpetrators of the April 22 terror attack. Armed with placards saying “I am Hindu”, they were shocked to find the high commission had organised a counter protest and plugged in a massive loudspeaker to blast out songs to drown out their chants.Col Taimur stood on the balcony of the mission building, draped with posters claiming human rights violations in J&K, waving a placard of Abhinandan Varthaman with the caption “the chai is fantastic” as he smiled and drew his finger across his throat and directed the gesture, pointedly, at the Indian side. The video has gone viral.A Met Police spokesperson said: “We are aware of this video and are now investigating. Officers are also in touch with the relevant govt department to determine what representations need to be made to the high commission.”As Pakistani songs blasted out, the Pakistani protesters danced and shouted obscenities at the Indian protesters, abusing Hindu gods and PM Narendra Modi, holding placards accusing India of “water terrorism”.They had a mic, the Indians did not. There were just yards between the two groups, with police in between, as they hurled abuse at each other.“There is no empathy or shame in the Pakistanis. They are partying over a terror attack,” said Amaana Begum (38), an Indian Muslim from Jaipur.“We came here to mourn the loss of life and here they are blasting out music and making gestures, and we just wanted to peacefully protest,” said Nandini Singh. “It is as if they are celebrating the loss of life.”When TOI confronted the Pakistani protesters, a man named Wahim alleged: “Pahalgam is a false-flag operation. It is a political act by India, nothing else.”Police swarmed around a group of young Indian-origin delivery drivers protesting. Suddenly, a Gujarati man sprinted off and around 15 police officers chased him down the street. He looked petrified as told he was under arrest for racially abusing a police officer. Next an officer grabbed a second young PIO delivery driver by the scruff of his neck and pulled him into the road and he too was handcuffed. Pakistani media videographed every second. Next, vans of police trained to handle public disorder turned up and all the Indian protesters were told to leave.One man was arrested on suspicion of affray and a racially aggravated public order offence. He was later released without further action, a Met Police spokesperson said. The other man was handcuffed, detained, and released, but not arrested.Indian protesters said their complaints to police about the other side fell on deaf ears. “The police were much stricter on us and allowed the other side to do what they wanted,” one said. “The men who were handcuffed were provoked by what the Pakistanis were saying.”","The Indian diaspora had gone to the Pakistan high commission to protest against who they believe are the perpetrators of the April 22 terror attack.

Overlooked letter shows Shakespeare was not a neglectful husband,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/overlooked-letter-shows-shakespeare-was-not-a-neglectful-husband/articleshow/120632792.cms,"NYT photo

Any clue about William Shakespeare's life usually excites scholars, but one piece of evidence had been neglected for decades. Now, a new analysis of that overlooked document seems to shatter a long-standing narrative about the Bard's bad marriage.Shakespeare was 18 in 1582 when he married Anne Hathaway, daughter of a family friend in Stratford-upon-Avon, in her mid-20s and pregnant. For centuries, it was thought he left his wife and children behind for a literary life in London, seeking to avoid ""the humiliation of domestic feuds"", as one 19th-century essayist put it. This view of Shakespeare's wife as a ""distant encumbrance"" suited scholars who thought ""Shakespeare was far too interesting to be a married guy,"" said Matthew Steggle, a professor at University of Bristol, England. The perception was bolstered by the fact that Shakespeare had left her his ""second best bed"" in his will. But Steggle's research, expected to be published this week in the journal Shakespeare, suggests the writer was not detached from his marriage after all.The hint lies in a fragment of a 17th-century letter addressing a ""Mrs Shakspaire,"" found in the binding of a book published in 1608. The letter was noted in 1978 by an amateur historian, but got minimal attention, even after the book was unbound in 2016, revealing what appeared to be part of a reply from Shakespeare's wife, Steggle said.If it really was addressed to Mrs Shakespeare, ""it is self-evidently remarkable,"" Steggle said - it offers new clues about their relationship, and suggests Mrs Shakespeare lived for a time in London with her husband. If she did live in London, she was possibly back in Stratford by the time she received the letter, around 1607 - though not necessarily because her husband wanted independence. Steggle says ""there is an obvious reason to avoid London in 1603-4, namely the very bad wave of plague"". Also, the upcoming arrival of their first grandchild after daughter Susanna's 1607 marriage ""would surely be a good time"" for Hathaway to be back in Stratford.Steggle says her movements should be reconsidered with an eye to her ""possible absences from London rather than her perpetual absence"". The letter concerned money for a fatherless child named John. It called upon her to pay money, most likely held in trust for him, a pledge her husband may have undertaken, and referred to a time when she ""dwelt in trinitie lane,"" which Steggle believes refers to a location in London.","William Shakespeare was 18 in 1582 when he married Anne Hathaway, daughter of a family friend.

Annabel Elliot , younger sister to the British Queen Camilla and official “companion” to her, has said she still cannot bring herself to curtsy to her elder sibling—even two decades after Camilla entered the royal family.The revelation came in a new Tatler profile written by royal biographer Robert Hardman to mark the 20th wedding anniversary of King Charles and Queen Camilla.Although royal customs have relaxed over time—and the official royal website says there are no compulsory gestures—curtsying remains common within the royal household. For most, especially insiders like Elliot who hold formal roles, such traditions are still followed.Elliot, an interior designer by profession, said the formality feels unnatural despite her sister’s royal status. “I think she’s transitioned beautifully, actually. I mean, I sometimes look at her, and I can’t really believe it,” she said, reflecting on Camilla’s journey from private citizen to Queen.While Elliot may skip the curtsy, her love and support for Camilla are unwavering. She has been described as the Queen’s emotional anchor, especially during a difficult year in 2024, which saw family health challenges and personal loss.In the BBC documentary Charles III: The Coronation Year, Elliot appeared visibly moved as she recalled watching her sister depart for Westminster Abbey in the golden coach. “It was quite a moment,” she said, recalling how surreal it felt to see someone she grew up with take the throne beside King Charles.",Annabel Elliot is the younger sister to the British Queen Camilla.

LONDON: Over 30 years after Britain's elite Magic Circle expelled a woman for posing as a man to gain admittance, the formerly male-only society is to welcome her back as a full member.The London-based international magic organisation ejected Sophie Lloyd after she masqueraded as a male in 1991 to win membership.But after her story came to light last year, the society's first female chair Laura London launched a search to track down Lloyd and apologise.She was eventually located living abroad and will later on Thursday be presented with a membership certificate at a special ceremony at the organisation's London headquarters.""It is so exciting after all these months tracking Sophie... I can't tell you how happy we are as a society to welcome her back into the fold,"" London told BBC radio.Lloyd posed as Raymond Lloyd for 18 months before unmasking herself as a woman.But members, who voted to admit women in September 1991, were so angered by her ""deliberate deception"" that they went ahead with her expulsion.The deception was in fact a two-person act involving the late magician Jenny Winstanley, who recruited Lloyd to help her prove that women magicians were just as good as men.""I did a 20-minute show in front of 200 people, three examiners, and spoke to the examiner for an hour-and-three-quarters afterwards,"" Lloyd said, recalling how she managed to pull the wool over everyone's eyes.After the Magic Circle changed its stance on allowing women in, Winstanley, who died in 2004, phoned the society to explain.""Two days later we got a letter to say Raymond's been expelled,"" said Lloyd.""We couldn't get our heads round it. We just thought, 'come on it's funny, it's amusing' but they didn't think so and Jenny was completely snubbed, unfortunately.""After the expulsion, Lloyd continued to perform magic for 11 years in an anti-bullying variety show before eventually moving overseas.She said the Magic Circle had changed out of all recognition in the 30 years since she was thrown out, adding: ""This is for Jenny really, Jenny would have loved it.""London said Thursday's ceremony would also be a chance to recognise Winstanley both for her contribution to magic and her audacious trick at the Magic Circle's expense.""I just think she's a wonderful woman and I know she'd have loved to be here and I just wish more than anything I could have met her myself,"" she said.The Magic Circle was founded in 1905 by around 20 magicians at a restaurant in London's Chinatown district.Members must vow never to give away the secrets of magic.Although women have now been admitted to the Magic Circle for over 30 years, they still make up only around five percent of the society's 1,700 membership.The body says, however, that increasing numbers are now coming through in the 10-18-year-old age group.","Sophie Lloyd was expelled from the Magic Circle after posing as a man to gain admittance.

He was suspected of fatally shooting his long-time friend and business partner, Rodrigo Chavez, in an alleged dispute linked to their struggling tourism business.Police confirmed that Hann was arrested early that morning and brought to the station for his own safety after he was “intercepted and beaten by local residents” following the shooting. Authorities said they were preparing to transfer him to Lago Agrio, about 75 miles away, but were delayed due to “geographical conditions.”At around 12:30 pm, a group of angry villagers stormed the station, forcibly removed Hann, and lynched him in the street before setting his body on fire, according to the local outlet Extra, which described the incident as “a shocking act of apparent community justice.”A police report identified the victim only as an “English national,” and a senior police official told the Daily Mail: “We are still trying to establish the specific identity of the citizen we believe is a British national. We know that he was working and teaching English and was making reservations for tourists visiting the area but we don’t have any more information right now.”Authorities said the situation escalated quickly, with seven officers present at the station during the mob attack. The officers reportedly feared for their lives and potential damage to state property. “They were carrying guns and other weapons including stones, sticks, spears and even cans of petrol they were threatening to burn the police station down with and harm officers,” the police chief said.Extra reported that the officers had received advance warnings about threats to the detainee’s safety but were unable to act due to the delayed arrival of backup. Ecuadorian broadcaster Ecuavisa stated that Hann died hours later from burns sustained during the lynching.According to sources close to the investigation, the motive behind the shooting was rooted in a bitter business dispute. Chavez had accused Hann of misappropriating funds from their tourism venture, cutting him out of the business amid financial struggles.The UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) said it is urgently working with Ecuadorian authorities and forensic teams to verify the victim’s identity and gather more information. The FCDO has not yet issued an official statement.","A British national was killed by a mob in Ecuador after being dragged from a police station in a remote Amazonian village.

Poll Should India reconsider its treaties with Pakistan following the attack? No, treaties should remain intact Yes, it’s necessary

Former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has expressed deep sorrow and outrage over the deadly terrorist attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, that killed at least 26 people on Tuesday. Most of the victims were tourists.Taking to X, Sunak wrote, “The barbaric attack in Pahalgam has stolen the lives of newlyweds, children, and families simply seeking joy. Our hearts break for them. To those mourning – know that the UK stands with you in sorrow and solidarity. Terror will never win. We grieve with India.”The Resistance Front (TRF), a group linked to the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba, claimed responsibility for the attack. Gunmen opened fire near a popular tourist meadow close to Pahalgam town, in what has become the worst attack in the region since the 2019 Pulwama bombing.Global leaders including US president Donald Trump have voiced their condemnation and support for India. Trump called the attack “deeply disturbing” and said the United States stood firmly with India in its fight against terrorism.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who returned early from a visit to Saudi Arabia, chaired a high-level security meeting in Delhi. India has since suspended the Indus Waters Treaty with Pakistan as part of its response.Earlier, Defence minister Rajnath Singh assured the nation of a ""loud and clear"" response to the Pahalgam terror attack that killed 28 people, mostly tourists.Rajanth Singh said that the government would hunt down not only the perpetrators who carried out the ghastly attack, but also those behind the scenes.","Former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has expressed deep sorrow and outrage over the deadly terrorist attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, that killed at least 26 people.

UK wildfires push records in first four months of 2025,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-wildfires-push-records-in-first-four-months-of-2025/articleshow/120491611.cms,"Firefighters tackle a wildfire in the Mourne Mountains, County Down, Northern Ireland (AFP)

LONDON: More than 110 wildfires have raged in the UK since the start of the year, according to satellite data released Monday, making it one of the worst years on record.At least 111 fires have torched an area of nearly 24,500 hectares (94 square miles) across the country since January 1, according to data Monday from the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS).The number of wildfires and area affected by them is higher than average for this time of the year, and higher than the same period in 2024.Only 2019 was worse in terms of the area burned (28,700 hectares) and 2022 for the number of fires (151) for the same period, according to the Press Association news agency.Last week, the National Fire Chiefs Council (NFCC) said fire and rescue services had already responded to 380 wildfires so far this year in England and Wales -- more than double the same period in 2022.The EFFIS data is based on satellite readings and only maps fires that are 30 hectares or larger -- accounting for the difference with records from the local authority.In comparison, the NFCC measures wildfires with an area of at least one hectare.""A particularly dry March, followed by warmer-than-average temperatures in April, has seen a number of significant wildfires across the UK over the last fortnight,"" the NFCC said in a statement.The UK and Ireland had a ""drier than average"" March, according to Europe's Copernicus climate monitor. Last month was also the hottest March ever recorded in Europe by a significant margin.""With the increase in extreme weather events, we know that fire and rescue services are stretched as they seek to keep their communities safe,"" said NFCC chair Phil Garrigan.The Met Office said the fires are due to dry and breezy conditions in spring which came after a damp winter, meaning there was ""fuel"" for the blazes because of plant growth.Firefighters in Northern Ireland have been battling dozens of blazes in the last week, with many residents having to evacuate homes and a weather warning for wildfires.The Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service (NIFRS) said it attended 296 wildfires between April 3-10, many of which were thought to be started deliberately.An ""extreme"" wildfire warning was issued for Scotland on Friday and Saturday, after multiple blazes broke out the previous week.According to Michael Humphreys from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS), wetter weather last year meant fewer blazes in 2024.","More than 110 wildfires have raged in the UK since the start of the year.

'Misplaced and without jurisdiction': Arms dealer Sanjay Bhandari rejects ED's plea to declare him a 'fugitive',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/misplaced-and-without-jurisdiction-arms-dealer-sanjay-bhandari-rejects-eds-plea-to-declare-him-a-fugitive/articleshow/120454377.cms,"Sanjay Bhandari

Arms dealer Sanjay Bhandari has strongly opposed the Enforcement Directorate 's (ED) plea to declare him a ""fugitive"" in connection with a black money case , telling a Delhi court on April 19 that his stay in the United Kingdom was legal. This follows a ruling from the London high court that denied his extradition to India. Bhandari, who has been living in the UK since fleeing India in 2016, claimed that the ED’s application was ""vague, misplaced and without jurisdiction"" and did not meet the requirements under the Fugitive Offenders Act.In February, the high court of justice in London allowed Bhandari to appeal his extradition, citing concerns about his safety in Tihar jail. The court found that he would be at ""real risk"" of extortion, threats, and ""actual violence"" from other prisoners and officials in the Indian prison system. Furthermore, the court ruled that Bhandari’s extradition would violate his human rights under the European Convention on Human Rights, specifically Article 3, which relates to protection from inhuman or degrading treatment. Earlier this month, the UK High Court also dismissed the Indian government’s appeal to challenge the decision in Britain’s Supreme Court.Bhandari’s lawyer, senior advocate Maninder Singh, argued that his client’s presence in the UK could not be deemed illegal, as he had a legal right to reside there. Singh emphasised that the Indian government was bound by the UK court’s decision, and declaring Bhandari a ""fugitive"" in this context would be legally incorrect.Singh further pointed out that the ED’s application failed to provide an assessment by the income tax department regarding the value of the black money case. As per the Fugitive Offenders Act, a person can only be declared a fugitive if the value involved exceeds Rs 100 crore. Singh argued that the ED had misled the court by suggesting that the case exceeded this threshold, as the income tax department had previously submitted that the amount was below Rs 100 crore. Additionally, Bhandari was discharged from non-bailable warrants after the UK High Court’s ruling, and no fresh warrants were pending against him, Singh stated.This legal battle comes amid Bhandari’s involvement in other high-profile cases, including an ongoing money laundering probe linked to Robert Vadra, the brother-in-law of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi. Bhandari has also been mentioned in relation to the ongoing investigations into fugitive Mehul Choksi, who recently cited the same UK court ruling in his own extradition case.","Sanjay Bhandari has strongly opposed the Enforcement Directorate's plea to declare him a ""fugitive"" in connection with a black money case.

Banned from entering the UK: French author alarmed by immigration fears for free speech in Britain

Who is Renaud Camus?

Why was he banned?

Renaud Camus , a French writer and philosopher known for his anti-immigration views, has been barred from entering the UK, British newspaper The Telegraph reported, noting that no official reason was provided for the ban.Camus had planned to visit the UK later this month for a speaking engagement. He also said he was scheduled to participate in a future debate at the Oxford Union.The author is planning to appeal the ban with help from the Free Speech Union , an organisation led by Lord Young , a Conservative peer in the House of Lords.Lord Young said, “We’ve reached out to him to see if he’d like any help in appealing this decision, and he said yes. So I anticipate that we are going to be getting an immigration lawyer on the case.”He also criticised the timing of the decision, calling it “tin-eared” given that Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is trying to build ties with Donald Trump, whose administration raised concerns about freedom of expression in the UK.Camus is a philosopher widely known for his Great Replacement theory . The theory claims that Europe’s native populations are being deliberately replaced by migrants.While the Home Office has not detailed the reasons, it said Camus’s presence “was not considered to be conducive to the public good.”The ban comes amid a heated debate over free speech in the UK, especially concerning immigration. Some believe that misinformation surrounding immigration played a role in fuelling the 2024 summer riots that followed the Southport murders.",Renaud Camus is a French writer and philosopher known for his anti-immigration views.

Meghan Markle’s use of ‘HRH’ sparks new royal feud as Prince William plans to revoke titles when he becomes king: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/meghan-markles-use-of-hrh-sparks-new-royal-feud-as-prince-william-plans-to-revoke-titles-when-he-becomes-king-report/articleshow/120782899.cms,"A fresh royal showdown may be looming as Prince William reportedly plans to permanently strip Prince Harry and Meghan Markle of their “HRH” (His or Her Royal Highness) styles once he ascends to the throne, a move insiders say reflects his growing frustration with the Sussexes’ continued ties to royal status.According to a Daily Beast report published Tuesday, William was incensed after Meghan used the “HRH” style in a personal note accompanying a gift basket, and after a Ukrainian official publicly addressed her as “Your Royal Highness” in a letter she later shared online. Though Meghan and Harry agreed not to use the style after stepping back from royal duties in 2020, they were never formally stripped of it, a distinction that now appears to be at the center of renewed controversy.The terms of their 2020 exit, known as the Sandringham Agreement, said the couple would no longer use the “HRH” designation “as they are no longer working members of the Royal Family.” But Meghan’s recent correspondence appears to have tested that boundary.One former courtier told The Daily Beast the Sussexes’ interpretation of the agreement is “complete rubbish,” adding, “They had agreed not to use the HRH titles at all, ever, in any capacity.”While King Charles has reportedly opted for a softer approach, sources say Prince William is less forgiving. “He loathes and despises Harry and Meghan with every bone in his body,” the source claimed. “There is no way King William will stand for this. The titles will simply be removed when he is king. A way will be found.”The issue also reignites questions of royal precedent. In modern times, only three royals have lost their “HRH” styles: Princess Diana and Sarah Ferguson after divorcing royal spouses, and Prince Andrew after his scandal involving Jeffrey Epstein.Whether a future King William could legally strip Harry and Meghan of their HRH status remains uncertain. However, former UK minister Norman Baker told The Daily Beast that the HRH style is ultimately a gift of the monarch. “The law is not clear,” he said, “but I have little doubt that... the monarch could remove the HRH title. It would basically be the equivalent to an executive order in the US.”So far, Buckingham Palace, Kensington Palace, and reps for the Sussexes have not commented.","Prince William reportedly plans to strip Prince Harry and Meghan Markle of their ""HRH"" (His or Her Royal Highness) styles once he ascends to the throne.

"Starbase, Texas? Elon Musk’s SpaceX hub may soon become an official city",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/starbase-texas-elon-musks-spacex-hub-may-soon-become-an-official-city/articleshow/120781718.cms,"(This is an AI image)

Billionaire and Tesla CEO Elon Musk has long embraced Texas as both a business hub and a playground, launching rockets, building cars, and envisioning a utopian community for his workers on the rural outskirts of Austin.Now, a new Musk venture is nearing success: a vote on Saturday that could officially transform a small area of coastal South Texas, home to his SpaceX rocket company, into a city called ""Starbase,"" the Associated Press reported.The initiative appears headed for success, given that many eligible voters are his employees. This would mark a positive development for the billionaire, whose public image has suffered following his involvement in federal spending reductions and an unsuccessful $20 million investment in Wisconsin Supreme Court elections.His Tesla automotive enterprise has experienced declining profits.County election records indicate that by Tuesday, approximately 200 of 283 eligible voters had participated in early voting. While Musk voted in the county during November elections, his name does not appear among early voters.The proposed municipality, whilst appearing as a wealthy individual's personal project, enjoys considerable local support. However, there are growing worries about how the city's establishment and related legislative measures might affect public access to a beloved recreational area traditionally known as the ""poor people's beach.""The prospective municipality, situated at Texas's southernmost point near the Mexican border, encompasses roughly 1.5 square miles (3.9 square kilometres).The area features sparse roadways, scattered airstream caravans and basic houses from the 1950s. Voters will cast their ballots in a facility on Memes St, a playful reference to Musk's social media platform X.The concept of establishing Starbase was initially proposed by Musk in 2021. SpaceX leadership has remained reticent about their motivations for creating a company-controlled municipality and has not addressed recent enquiries.However, ongoing disputes regarding beach accessibility indicate potential underlying interests.SpaceX's operational activities, including rocket launches , engine testing, and equipment transportation at the launch facility, necessitate closing nearby highways and restricting access to Boca Chica State Park and Beach.Currently, these closures require coordination with Cameron County authorities. Pending state legislation would transfer primary oversight to the new municipality, coinciding with SpaceX's application to the Federal Aviation Administration to increase annual launches from five to 25.SpaceX representatives indicate the proposed legislation would enhance operational efficiency for the company, which maintains contracts with the Department of Defense and NASA for its Starship heavy rocket programme, including planned lunar missions and eventual Mars expeditions.""This fully reusable rocket system keeps the US ahead of global competitors like China, and its being developed right here in South Texas,"" SpaceX Vice President of Starship Legal and Regulatory Sheila McCorkle wrote to state lawmakers.""We need to carry on our mission of turning South Texas into the Gateway to Mars and making humankind multiplanetary,"" McCorkle added. She noted the company's $4 billion investments and thousands of jobs in Texas.Public response has been mixed. Numerous SpaceX employees submitted identical supportive statements, while opponents express concerns about private control over public beach access.Supporters of SpaceX’s plan praised the company’s contributions to the area, highlighting job creation and investments. However, opponents argues that granting Musk and his company too much control over a popular beach, which attracts tens of thousands of visitors annually, would be a mistake.Cameron County Judge Eddie Trevino Jr emphasised that the county has managed beach closures responsibly and sees no need to shift authority to the new city. ""SpaceX is a strong economic driver in our region, one of which we are extremely proud,"" Trevino said in a letter to state lawmakers, the Associated Press reported.Another proposed bill would make it a Class B misdemeanor, punishable by up to 180 days in jail, for failing to evacuate the beach when ordered. However, this measure would only take effect if the new city gained control over beach closures.In a temporary setback for Musk and SpaceX, a state House panel recently rejected a bill that would have transferred the authority to close beaches for rocket launches from the local county government to the proposed new city.","Billionaire and Tesla CEO Elon Musk has long embraced Texas as both a business hub and a playground.

US private sector delegation heads to Greenland amid Donald Trump's threats to buy the island,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-private-sector-delegation-heads-to-greenland-amid-donald-trumps-threats-to-buy-the-island/articleshow/120781831.cms,"US President Donald Trump remains determined to annex Greenland, despite his failed attempts to apply diplomatic pressure in recent months.Now, a private sector delegation, led by the Trump administration is heading to explore investment opportunities in the island’s rich natural resources and inject significant capital into the region, according to Reuters.The move comes after Trump’s earlier efforts to acquire Greenland through diplomatic channels were firmly rejected by both Greenland and Denmark.Since Trump's presidency began in January, American interest in Greenland, which remains under Danish sovereignty while maintaining self-governance, has intensified, creating diplomatic friction with Copenhagen.Trump has not ruled out the use of military force to acquire Greenland if Denmark refuses to ""sell it.""The American private sector is seeking to invest in Greenland's abundant natural resources, particularly its rare earth mineral deposits. The timing aligns with recent political changes, as Jens-Frederik Nielsen has assumed the role of prime minister in the Arctic territory.This delegation of private sector representatives is making their inaugural visit to the Arctic island following the election victory of Jens-Frederik Nielsen, who represents the business-friendly Demokratiit Party as the new premier.The delegation, led by Drew Horn—CEO of GreenMet and a former energy official under Trump—includes representatives from companies such as Critical Metals Corp, Cogency Power, American Renewable Metals, and Refacture.Backed by major institutional investors like Cerberus Capital Management and Cantor Fitzgerald, the group aims to boost US private sector presence in Greenland.""I'm not trying to do anything crazy like orchestrate a purchase or acquisition of Greenland by the United States,"" Horn told Reuters.""We're looking simply to do traditional private sector business development,"" he added, noting his consortium includes established investors like Cerberus Capital Management and Cantor Fitzgerald.The visit occurs shortly after Denmark's King Frederik's trip, symbolising the continued unity between Greenland and its former colonial power. Nielsen has called for stronger international ties while reaffirming Greenland’s relationship with Denmark.Interest in Greenland has grown since Trump took office, driven by the island's vast deposits of rare earth elements and other minerals, potentially worth trillions. Greenland's mining sector, potentially worth trillions in mineral deposits, currently sees dominance from Australian, Canadian, and British firms, with minimal American involvement.Horn further said that the private sector growth could enhance collaboration in an independent Greenland supported by US private development. The delegation's itinerary includes visiting the Tanbreez mining site, amongst the world's largest rare earth deposits.","A private sector delegation, led by the Trump administration, is heading to Greenland to explore investment opportunities.

Poverty, witchcraft

Lively prayer

VATICAN CITY: Ghana's Cardinal Peter Turkson is seen as one of the Church's most influential men from Africa, where Christianity is quickly growing -- and which some believe could be the birthplace of the next pope.The 76-year-old born into a humble family of 10 children is the first clergyman from the west African country to receive a red hat, having been made cardinal in 2003 by John Paul II.Turkson currently serves as chancellor for two pontifical academies, that of sciences and social sciences.Even before former pope Benedict XVI's surprise resignation in 2013, the cardinal had been considered Africa's frontrunner for papal contender -- generating countless speculative headlines about the first black pope .But Turkson demurred in a 2010 interview: ""I wouldn't want to be that first black pope.""""I think he'll have a rough time.""The possibility of Turkson as pope reflects shifting Church demographics -- from Europe, where membership is dwindling, to Africa, where Christianity is growing the fastest.Born in the southern mining town of Nsuta-Wassa, Turkson was the fourth of 10 children to a Methodist mother who sold vegetables and a Catholic father, a carpenter.He was ordained in 1975 before leaving Ghana to study in Rome and New York.In 1992, then-pope John Paul II named Turkson the Archbishop of Cape Coast, a diocese of about 300,000 Catholics that grew under his watch.In 2003, the pontiff promoted him to cardinal.In Ghana in 2008, Turkson acted as mediator on a peace council following close elections that threatened to erupt into violence.A year later he was chosen by Benedict XVI for a key role within a special assembly for Africa by the Synod of Bishops, weighing in on such topics as reconciliation, poverty, AIDS, the brain drain and witchcraft.Benedict again tapped Turkson in 2009 as president of the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace, charged with social justice and human rights.As part of a reform of the Roman Curia -- the government of the Holy See -- Pope Francis in 2016 named Turkson head of a newly created department, the Dicastery for Promoting Integral Human Development, that merged the justice and peace council with three others.Shepherding the economic and social issues deemed priorities to Francis, including the environment, Turkson -- who speaks six languages -- visited the World Economic Forum in Davos multiple times to convince business leaders of the perils of trickle-down economics.In 2016, he was dispatched as papal special envoy to South Sudan to try to reconcile warring parties, and during the Covid-19 pandemic, he headed a task force to study the crisis' economic and social fallout.But Turkson resigned as prefect of the dicastery in a 2021 shakeup following an external review and rumoured internal tensions within the division, leaving no Africans among the Vatican's top posts.Although Turkson has criticised anti-gay legislation in Uganda, he defends Catholic sexual morality and has denied that homosexuality is a human rights issue.On the key issue in Africa of condoms, he has suggested they could be useful for monogamous couples in which one partner is HIV-positive, but also that money would be better spent on anti-retroviral drugs for those already infected.Turkson had to apologise in 2012 after a high-profile blunder in which he showed a scare-mongering YouTube video about the rising rate of Muslims in the world during a synod of bishops.Regarding Africans' view of Catholicism, Turkson has suggested that the Evangelical movement has done a better job at converting because the Church has become too cerebral, while Evangelism appeals ""to the heart, with lively music, lively prayer"".""Sometimes we Africans make fun of how Europeans and Americans are such enthusiastic sports fans,"" Turkson said in 2012.""They can yell and shout and sing their hearts out at a soccer or football game, but in church even to sing a hymn seems to be such a penitential exercise.""",Ghana's Cardinal Peter Turkson is seen as one of the Church's most influential men from Africa.

Why did the lights go out in Spain and Portugal? Here's what we know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/why-did-the-lights-go-out-in-spain-and-portugal-heres-what-we-know/articleshow/120780885.cms,"The cause remains under investigation.

Hospitals, banks and travel were disrupted.

Temperatures at the time of the outage were higher than usual.

Attention has focused on Spain's reliance on renewable energy.

Other European outages have halted daily life.

After a nearly daylong power outage upended life for millions across Spain and Portugal, authorities in both countries are still searching for the cause of the disruption.Some of Spain's top officials convened Wednesday to discuss the blackout, which halted critical infrastructure starting Monday afternoon for nearly 18 hours in some areas.Power was almost entirely restored by Tuesday in Spain and Portugal, as well as in southern France, where households in the Basque region were affected.Spain's top security and defense officials met Wednesday to discuss the blackout, with officials saying they were considering a range of possibilities. The Spanish government has asked European regulators and various domestic agencies to investigate what happened.On Tuesday, Eduardo Prieto, director of services for Spain's national power company, Red Eléctrica, said that there were no ""definitive conclusions"" about the reasons for the outage, although he and other officials ruled out a cyberattack.Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez of Spain said that a committee of technical experts from the European Commission would investigate the cause.Some facts have emerged about how the blackout began.Around noon Monday, a high-voltage connection between France and Spain was interrupted, according to Kristian Ruby, secretary-general of Eurelectric, a trade body that represents the European electricity industry. The power outage occurred just over 30 minutes later.While that interruption would have been expected to be disruptive, it would not normally lead to a ""system collapse"" like the one that occurred Monday, Ruby said. Some other complication would typically need to happen, ""like a sudden outage at a power plant, a sudden development on the demand side,"" he said. ""Then you can have an incident like this.""During the outage, there were widespread problems connecting to the internet and to phone networks across Spain and Portugal.Hospitals in Spain were forced to run on generators. Portuguese banks and schools closed. Spain's national rail company said that trains had stopped operating at all stations. Subways in several cities, including Valencia and Madrid, were halted. And people crammed into stores to buy food and other essentials as clerks used pen and paper to record cash-only transactions.According to Spain's meteorological agency, AEMET, temperatures across the country were between 60 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit around the time of the outage. By the end of the day, highs had climbed to between 82 and 87 degrees.In a typical April, temperatures in Spain average around 64 degrees in central and northern regions and around 70 degrees in the south.Asked whether the outage was connected to the heat, Bruno Silva, a spokesperson for the Portuguese electricity supplier REN, was skeptical. ""No, I hope not,"" he said.The incident has raised questions about whether Spain's rapid shift to renewable energy left it more vulnerable to outages.More than half of Spain's electricity came from renewable energy last year, putting it at the forefront of Europe's transition to sources such as wind turbines and solar farms. That has led to lower electricity prices in Spain, but the rapid transition has also left the Spanish power grid -- and Portugal, which it supplies energy to -- prone to disruptions, analysts say.Old-line power sources like gas turbines and nuclear plants are better at buffering the fluctuations that can arise with intermittent sources like wind and solar power. Experts said that it might have been easier for Spain to manage instability in its power grid if conventional power sources had a larger presence and if Spain had invested more in grid infrastructure and electricity storage facilities, like batteries, to provide backup power.But officials in Spain have said they don't believe there is a connection between the energy supply and the outage. Beatriz Corredor, the chair of Red Eléctrica, told Spanish radio Wednesday that it was ""not correct to link the incident to renewable energy.""More than 50 million people in Italy were affected by an outage for almost a full day in 2003 after a line between Switzerland and Italy was overloaded. It was considered the worst day of blackouts in the country since World War II.In 2006, 10 million people in Germany were briefly without power after the northwestern part of the country's power grid became overloaded.And last year, much of the Balkans was without power for several hours during a heat wave in which temperatures soared to 40 degrees Celsius, or over 100 degrees Fahrenheit.",Spain's top security and defense officials met Wednesday to discuss the blackout. Authorities in both countries are still searching for the cause of the disruption. Power was almost entirely restored by Tuesday in Spain and Portugal. The outage halted critical infrastructure for nearly 18 hours in some areas.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120781308,imgsize-905048,width-400,resizemode-4/Photo-credit-AP.jpg"

Very careful planning had been completed to allow the targets to be prosecuted with minimal risk to civilians or non-military infrastructure. As a further precaution, the strike was conducted after dark, when the likelihood of any civilians being in the area was reduced yet further.""Typhoon FGR4s of the UK's Royal Air Force participated in the joint airstrikes.","US defence secretary Pete Hegseth warned Iran there would be ""consequence"" for giving ""lethal"" support to Yemen's Houthi rebels.

(AP)

What began as a thrilling seventh-inning rally by the Pittsburgh Pirates on Wednesday night quickly turned into a scene of fear and silence, as a man fell from the 21-foot-high Clemente Wall in right field at PNC Park .The fall occurred moments after Andrew McCutchen smacked a two-run double that gave the Pirates a 4-3 lead over the Chicago Cubs . But as fans roared and players celebrated, attention abruptly shifted toward the warning track, where the man lay motionless after plummeting over the outfield wall.Players from both teams urgently waved for medical help. Pirates manager Derek Shelton and Cubs manager Craig Counsell immediately rushed to alert the umpiring crew. “Even though it’s 350 feet away, the way he went down and then just laid there, it was awful,” Shelton said. “That’s an understatement.”Trainers from both teams and stadium staff tended to the man for nearly five minutes before he was carefully loaded onto a cart and driven off the field. The Pirates later said he was taken to Allegheny General Hospital. His condition remains unknown.McCutchen was seen holding a cross from his necklace, praying alongside teammates. Cubs players dropped to their knees, heads bowed. “I didn’t see it happen, but from the look on Counsell’s face, I knew it was serious,” said Cubs shortstop Dansby Swanson. “I’ve never been part of something like that. I hope I never am again.”The incident rekindled painful memories of previous stadium tragedies, including the 2015 fall of a Braves fan at Turner Field and the 2011 death of a Texas Rangers fan reaching for a ball. Despite those past warnings, fans continue to fall victim to steep drops at sporting venues.Though play resumed, the atmosphere inside PNC Park never fully recovered.As Swanson put it: “Fans are why we get to do what we love.

On April 18, the US government launched an official Covid-19 website reiterating claims that the virus leaked from a lab in China. The site also criticized former President Joe Biden, Dr Anthony Fauci, and the World Health Organization for failing to hold China accountable.China’s white paper pushes back, citing a Missouri lawsuit that resulted in a symbolic $24 billion ruling against China, accusing Beijing of hoarding personal protective equipment and covering up the initial outbreak. The document calls the ruling politically motivated and legally flawed.“Substantial evidence suggested the Covid-19 might have emerged in the United States earlier than its officially-claimed timeline, and earlier than the outbreak in China,” the paper asserts, urging the international community to investigate early US cases.China said it had shared relevant information with the WHO and other countries in a timely and transparent manner. It highlighted the joint WHO-China study, which concluded that a lab leak was “extremely unlikely.”“The US should not continue to pretend to be deaf and dumb,” the white paper mentioned, urging Washington to address global concerns rather than deflect blame.Earlier this year, the CIA said it leaned slightly toward the lab-leak theory over natural origin but admitted having “low confidence” in its assessment. It maintained that both scenarios remained plausible.An official from China’s National Health Commission also told Xinhua that future origin-tracing efforts should now focus on the United States.With both sides digging in, the renewed exchange signals that the question of Covid-19’s origin remains a geopolitical flashpoint with no clear end in sight.","China accuses the United States of politicising the Covid-19 issue.

Immigrants detained at Bluebonnet detention centre in Anson, Texas, created an S-O-S signal visible from above this week.Thirty-one men arranged themselves to form the letters whilst a Reuters drone captured footage on Monday.Previously, numerous Venezuelan detainees received notices from immigration officials suggesting their involvement with the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, making them eligible for deportation under wartime legislation, as evidenced by documents, video calls and court records.Seven detainees' families spoke to Reuters, denying gang affiliations and confirming their relatives refused to sign the documents.On Friday, April 18, authorities attempted to transport them to Abilene Regional Airport, but the journey was interrupted and they returned to the facility.The Supreme Court subsequently issued a temporary halt to deportations, with the Department of Homeland Security offering no comment on the situation.The Venezuelans at Bluebonnet remain at risk of transfer to CECOT, El Salvador's high-security prison, where 137 Venezuelans were previously sent under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act.The privately-operated Bluebonnet facility, situated 200 miles west of Dallas, houses approximately 846 detainees daily in fiscal year 2025. Reuters captured aerial photographs after being denied direct access, revealing some detainees in red high-risk uniforms.Reuters identified several detainees, including Diover Millan, 24, and Jeferson Escalona, 19. Millan, transferred from Georgia's Stewart detention centre, lacks a criminal record despite officials claiming gang membership without evidence.Escalona, detained since January 2025, denies gang involvement, stating he served as a police officer in Venezuela. He believes authorities misinterpreted common Venezuelan hand gestures in photos on his confiscated phone.Despite requesting voluntary return to Venezuela, Escalona remains detained, expressing fears for his safety.Recent years have seen numerous Venezuelans seeking refuge in the United States, escaping economic hardship and alleged authoritarian measures under President Nicolas Maduro. The Trump administration aims to revoke temporary humanitarian protections established during Joe Biden's presidency.","Immigrants detained at Bluebonnet detention centre in Anson, Texas, created an S-O-S signal visible from above this week.

Pakistan Senate Session-349 (Day-04) 29-04-2025

As India and Pakistan grapple with renewed tensions after the deadly Pahalgam terror attack , a video of Pakistani Senator Palwasha Mohammad Zai Khan making provocative remarks in Pakistan parliament has gone viral, fuelling diplomatic ire and social media outrage.In a fiery speech delivered in Pakistan’s Upper House on April 29, the senator declared, “The first brick of the new Babri mosque in Ayodhya will be laid by Pakistan Army soldiers, and the first azaan will be given by Army Chief Asim Munir himself.”The comments, invoking the Babri mosque demolished in 1992, came as part of a broader tirade laced with religious and militaristic rhetoric. Palwasha Khan, a member of the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and deputy information secretary, suggested that the path was being laid for a “Muslim government, specifically a Pakistani Muslim government, in the Indian subcontinent.”“There is no doubt, this enmity is not with Pakistan or Pakistanis; this is enmity against Muslims and against Islam,” she said.Issuing a direct threat to India, she warned, “The Senate of Pakistan must send a message, if any hand reaches toward us, then the symbol of their power, the Red Fort of Delhi, will witness a bloodshed that its walls have never seen, and its ramparts will testify to it for centuries to come.”Khan, who represents Sindh in the Senate and previously served in the National Assembly from 2008 to 2013, emphasized that Pakistanis were not weak. “We are not wearing bangles,” she said.Quoting late Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez , she added, “We have guns, we have arms, we have trees—and if the enemy tries anything, we will hang their corpses from our trees.”Despite the hostile language, she claimed to have no quarrel with Indian citizens. “But let me be clear: we have no enmity with the people of India.”Khan also attempted to draw religious divides within the Indian armed forces, asserting, “The Sikh army will not attack Pakistan because it’s the land of Guru Nanak for them.”She went on to praise Khalistani separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannu, who is a designated terrorist under Indian law. “I want to salute Sikh leader Gurpatwant Singh Pannu, who courageously declared that no Indian soldier will be allowed to cross into Pakistan from Indian Punjab.”Ending her speech with a call to arms, the senator proclaimed, “Our army is not just six or seven lakh soldiers, we have 250 million people who, when the time comes, will stand shoulder to shoulder with our armed forces and become soldiers themselves, God willing.”The speech has since circulated widely on social media platforms, drawing sharp reactions amid the already strained ties between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.","Pakistani Senator Palwasha Mohammad Zai Khan made provocative remarks in Pakistan parliament.

In a letter to US secretary of state Marco Rubio , the students requested him to revoke the visas of Pakistani officials who will attend the Pakistan Conference 2025 at Harvard University.""We are students at Harvard Kennedy School, deeply disturbed by the recent targeted terrorist attack in Pahalgam, India, on April 22, 2025.

No, it lacks detail Yes, it is credible

Islamabad: Pakistan’s military rejected on Tuesday India’s accusations linking it to the deadly Pahalgam attack in Jammu and Kashmir, which killed 26 people, mostly tourists.Addressing a press conference in the garrison city of Rawalpindi, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) head Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry accused India of sponsoring terrorism in Pakistan , particularly Balochistan, while presenting limited evidence. The sharp exchange of allegations has deepened the India-Pakistan rift, raising concerns about a broader confrontation.Chaudhry revealed the arrest of Abdul Majeed near Jhelum on April 25, alleging he was trained in India to carry out terrorist activities in Pakistan. Authorities recovered a drone, an IED, and Rs 25,000 (approximately $90) in cash from Majeed, which Chaudhry claimed was proof of India’s covert operations. “India is actively supporting terrorist networks on Pakistani soil,” he alleged, challenging New Delhi to substantiate its claims about Pakistan’s involvement in the Pahalgam attack. “Seven days have passed, and India has failed to provide a single shred of evidence,” he added.However, Pakistan’s evidence lacks detailed substantiation, raising questions about its weight.India, too, has accused Pakistan of orchestrating the Pahalgam attack without publicly disclosing evidence. In response, India announced the suspension of the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, closed the Attari and Wagah borders, and recalled its defence attachés from Islamabad. Pakistan rejected India’s treaty suspension, closed its airspace to Indian flights, and warned that disrupting its water rights would be an “act of war”.Analysts warn that the current standoff risks spiralinginto a broader conflict. The Indus Waters Treaty, a rare success in India-Pakistan diplomacy, has survived previous tensions, and its suspension could have catastrophic consequences for Pakistan, a lower riparian state dependent on the Indus river system.Pakistan’s allegations of Indian-sponsored terrorism, while serious, also demand scrutiny. The evidence presented – centered on Majeed’s arrest – lacks granular detail, and Islamabad’s narrative risks being dismissed as tit-for-tat rhetoric. Both nations’ reliance on public accusations over backchannel diplomacy underscores the erosion of trust.","Pakistan rejects India’s accusations linking it to the deadly Pahalgam attack in Jammu and Kashmir, which killed 26 people, mostly tourists.

DHAKA: The central bank of Bangladesh has apparently incurred a huge financial loss due to the interim govt’s decision not to issue previously printed notes, with approximately Taka 15,000 crore worth of paper notes featuring the image of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman remaining unused. The decision aligns with govt’s efforts to diminish Bangabandhu’s presence in public memory.Although bank officials are unwilling to discuss the matter publicly, many, on conditions of anonymity, said the longstanding tradition of obtaining new notes from Bangladesh Bank has been abruptly halted, creating a crisis in the market. On the one hand, the printed money is being wasted without use; on the other hand, customers are suffering as a result, they added.“Notes of various denominations are printed using paper and ink purchased with people’s taxes. Millions of notes with Bangabandhu’s picture are still lying in the vaults of various banks. The Security Printing Corporation does not have the capacity to cancel all the notes at once and print new ones. Therefore, notes with Bangabandhu’s picture cann’t be suddenly cancelled,” Ziauddin Ahmed, former executive director of Bangladesh Bank and former managing director of Security Printing Corporation, told reporters.In this situation, he suggested the printed notes be circulated in the market to alleviate public suffering. “When new design notes come into the market, the old ones should be gradually withdrawn. Generally, notes printed once can be used for a maximum of four to five years,” Ahmed said.According to media reports, Bangladesh Bank is unable to issue new notes to banks in line with demand. The crisis became evident following the country’s political upheaval in Aug last year.Since all forms of currency, including metal coins, feature Mujibur’s image, Bangladesh Bank abruptly stopped issuing new notes early April. As a result, the notes featuring Bangabandhu’s image are not reaching the market. Shops, banks, and citizens are now left with torn and old, dirty notes.According to sources at Bangladesh Bank, the Security Printing Corporation is set to begin printing new design notes next month. In the first phase, new design notes of 20, 50, and 1,000 taka will be printed and subsequently released in the market through banks.","Taka 15,000 crore worth of paper notes featuring the image of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman remain unused.

COLOMBO: Sri Lanka's catholic church says the Vatican has named 167 of its faithful killed in Islamic State-inspired suicide bombings six years ago as witnesses of faith.Hundreds, including Christian, Buddhist, Hindu and Islamic religious figures, attended a vigil Monday in memory of the victims at the church of St. Anthony, targeted in the attacks.Archbishop of Colombo, Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, told the attendees Cardinal Marcello Semeraro, prefect of the Dicastery for the Causes of Saints in the Vatican, has included the names of 167 catholics who died in the bombings in the churches of St. Anthony in Colombo and St. Sebastian in Negombo ""in the catalogue of the witnesses of the faith in its order book, considering the context of their heroism.""He said they were chosen ""due to violent opposition to their faith motivated by 'odium fidei,' the hate of the faith."" Ranjith also said seven victims of other faiths were ""respectfully remembered.""Witnesses of faith are those who sacrificed their lives for their belief. Pope Francis formalized in 2023 a new category of recognition by the church of people who lost their lives while professing the catholic faith and created a special Vatican commission to catalogue their cases. The commission, based in the Vatican's saint-making office, has gathered hundreds of cases, with a view to highlighting them alongside officially recognized martyrs of the church, who are on the path to possible beatification or sainthood.More than 260 people, including 42 foreigners, were killed in the near-simultaneous bombings during Easter Sunday at three tourist hotels and three churches, two Catholic and one Protestant, on April 21, 2019.The catholic church in Sri Lanka has demanded further probing in the attacks, particularly after British television Channel 4 interviewed a man who said that he arranged a meeting between a local IS-inspired group, National Thowheed Jamath, and a top state intelligence official to hatch a plot to create insecurity in Sri Lanka and enable former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to win the presidential election later that year.","Sri Lanka's catholic church says the Vatican has named 167 of its faithful killed in Islamic State-inspired suicide bombings six years ago as witnesses of faith.

Forecasters say Thursday may be Britain's warmest May 1, with highs expected to reach 84.2F (29C).The heat has been driven by two key factors: a large area of high pressure that has settled over Britain, causing descending air that warms as it sinks, and continuous sunshine, fuelling daytime heating.Aidan McGivern, a meteorologist at the Met Office, explained that this has been a familiar pattern over the last few months. ""The sun this time of the year is as strong as it is in Aug,"" he said. ""We're not importing this air from anywhere else - this is homegrown warmth."" London recorded Britain's highest temperature of the year on Monday, only for that to be beaten on Tuesday.The mercury is expected to rise further on Wednesday and Thursday. Overnight temperatures have been above average too, with parts of Scotland experiencing their warmest April night on record.The peak of the heat is expected on Thursday. Temperatures in southern England could reach 29C, which would be a record for May 1. The current record was set in 1990 in Lossiemouth, Scotland, which hit 27.4C.

UK govt says ‘India has full support to go after perpetrators’ of Pahalgam terror attack,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-govt-says-india-has-full-support-to-go-after-perpetrators-of-pahalgam-terror-attack/articleshow/120742075.cms,"TOI correspondent from London

: The UK govt has said “India has our full support to go after the perpetrators of that attack (Pahalgam terror attack)” and that it is “seeking to play its full diplomatic role to help manage heightened tensions between India and Pakistan” as the tensions spill over onto the streets of Britain.But, foreign office minister Hamish Falconer said in the House of Commons on Tuesday, “It is important there is a proper law-enforcement-led response based on a focus of the actual perpetrators.”Britain said it was “vital that here in the UK all of us in positions of influence at a community level do what we can to ensure those tensions do not play out on British streets. A terrible terrorist attack has been perpetrated … We encourage Pakistanis to cooperate fully with the Indian govt in their efforts to investigate,” Falconer said. He was speaking during a debate on the Pahalgam attack, which left 26 people dead, following an urgent question by Labour MP Gurinder Singh Josan.“The two states are talking to each other, which is welcome. It is understandable the concerns India has for its security in light of such a horrific incident and it is clearly taking steps to try to establish the facts of the incident as best it can and will have British support to do so,” Falconer said.Falconer refrained from commenting on what UK security agencies know as to who is behind the attacks. He said both the Pakistan and India high commissions “will receive all support from the UK state to ensure they remain safe.”A J&K-born man, Ankit Love (41), was charged with criminal damage after allegedly smashing windows at the Pakistan high commission on Sunday. He appeared in court on Monday. He was blacklisted by the Indian govt after being charged with criminal damage for throwing eggs and stones at the India high commission in Feb 2022.Falconer toldMPs he was aware of the throat-slitting gesture video of a Pakistan diplomat. “The Metropolitan police are investigating, so I will not provide any further commentary on that particular incident, but it is obviously concerning,” Falconer said.Several MPs expressed their horror at how Hindus and Christians were targeted in the attack. Others criticised India for suspending the Indus water treaty or making “unfounded claims” against Pakistan or resorting to ""bulldozer tactics"".Labour MP Barry Gardiner asked: “Is it not time to make the support we give to Pakistan conditional on them finally closing down the terrorist training camps that they harbour?”“Until the investigation is concluded, we should not speculate on the nature of the attack. As we understand it, international agreements have been put in abeyance, rather than being rescinded,” Falconer said.","India has our full support to go after the perpetrators of that attack (Pahalgam terror attack), UK govt says.

What’s the tile game Meghan Markle played on Netflix? A beginner’s guide to mahjong,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/whats-the-tile-game-meghan-markle-played-on-netflix-a-beginners-guide-to-mahjong/articleshow/120736644.cms,"Meghan Markle played the game of Mahjong in her Netflix series

From the Qing dynasty to pop culture

How is mahjong played?

Connor Wan, a 29-year-old British-Chinese artist, learned mahjong while visiting family in Hong Kong. He enjoyed it so much that he started the Four Winds Mahjong Club in London, and later brought it to Toronto after moving there in 2024. “Moving countries is hard, especially when you don’t know anyone,” he said. The club became popular quickly, not as a place for gambling, but for making friends and celebrating Asian culture. Nicole Wong, a writer and audio producer from California, started playing mahjong as a teenager with her grandparents. She later began The Mahjong Project in 2019 to share the game’s cultural stories and organise pop-up game nights. This year, she published a book called Mahjong: House Rules from Across the Asian Diaspora. Nicole says the sound of the tiles is especially powerful. “Mahjong is more than just fun,” she says. “It has a deep history and brings back strong memories.” In Toronto, Robyn Feldberg has taught over 250 people how to play mahjong through her courses. She donates all the money—about $50,000 so far—to charities like Save A Child’s Heart. She says the game is especially popular with young mothers who want a fun way to relax and connect with others. “They tell me, ‘We want something that’s just for us,’” she said.

A centuries-old Chinese game called mahjong is having a modern revival across continents, from luxury cruise ships and trendy hotel lounges to Meghan Markle’s Netflix series.In the sixth episode of her docuseries With Love, the Duchess of Sussex invites friends for a cosy game night – playing mahjong, reports the Globe and Mail.The four-person tile-based game, traditionally associated with Chinese culture, is now catching on with new generations across the globe. “The game itself is really so fun,” says Markle. “But what was so great was the idea of learning something new with your friends, together... the mahjong becomes the background of the expansion of friendship. It’s the feeling of community.”Mahjong dates back to the mid-1800s during the Qing Dynasty in China. Traditionally played with 144 tiles, the game blends skill, strategy and a touch of luck. Players pick and discard tiles to form winning hands, much like the card game rummy.The game’s expansion across the world has now erupted into a full-blown trend. The World Mahjong Championship was recently held in Mississauga, Ontario – the first time it’s been hosted in North America. Hotels such as the Ace Hotel New York and Thompson Hotel Dallas regularly hold mahjong-themed nights.Fans with money to spare are buying fancy mahjong sets from Hermès, Louis Vuitton, and Ralph Lauren. Some are even splashing out on luxury tables that shuffle the tiles automatically – costing over $4,500.Even cruise ships have joined the trend, offering mahjong tournaments and special rooms just for playing the game.Mahjong is played with 144 tiles. Players begin by shuffling the tiles face down. Everyone rolls dice and the highest roller becomes the dealer. Each player picks 36 tiles and builds a wall—two rows of 18 tiles. The walls are pushed forward, creating a space in the middle for discards. Each player then draws 13 tiles (the dealer starts with 14), and the game begins.Players take turns drawing one tile and discarding one, always keeping 13 tiles in hand. You can draw a new tile or pick up someone’s discarded one. If a discarded tile helps complete a set (called a meld), you can grab it, announce the set, and show the tiles. To win, a player must have four melds (like three or four matching tiles or a sequence of three in a suit) and one pair (two matching tiles)—making 14 tiles total.There are five types of tiles: Bamboo, Characters, Dots (these are the three main suits), and special tiles called Honors (Dragons and Winds) and Bonus (Flowers and Seasons). Each suit goes from 1 to 9. Honors and Bonus tiles add extra excitement but aren't needed to win. Mahjong mixes strategy and memory with a bit of luck—and it’s all about building the right sets before your opponents do.For many mahjong fans, it’s not just a game but a deeply social experience.","Mahjong dates back to the mid-1800s during the Qing Dynasty in China.

UK Prince William has taken a step toward modernising the British monarchy by dropping the ""no selfies"" rule once set by his late grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II .The Prince of Wales is making gradual changes to the traditional royal protocols to better fit the modern world.The 42-year-old heir to the throne has consistently shown his contemporary approach to royal duties, recently demonstrated by abolishing his grandmother's strict photography rule, which King Charles had previously upheld.According to the Express' royal editor Emily Ferguson, reflecting on his recent two-day visit to Estonia, she said, ""William appears to be taking a new approach to public engagements.""""On the first day of his trip, he fully embraced the crowds and appeared to revel in the dozens of requests for selfies, happily taking people's phones to take the snap himself,"" Emily added.The outlet observed that the Prince of Wales has altered his approach towards public interactions. ""The prince always used to spend time greeting well-wishers but never with the same enthusiasm as his father,"" she said.""But that's changed in recent months, William is spending longer and longer on walkabouts and is more than happy to pose for endless pictures,"" she continued.Furthermore, the father of three has reportedly modified international royal tours, favouring brief visits over extended stays.The future king spent under two days in Estonia, participating in military exercises with British troops whilst wearing combat fatigues, before returning to Britain.These condensed visits enable the royal family to engage with numerous countries efficiently.Reports from last year indicated William has also modernised internal communications procedures.Alastair Martin, who served both King Charles and William at the Duchy of Cornwall, told the Sunday Times that the prince shared his mobile number, marking an ""overnight adjustment.""""If you want me, just get me, just message me,"" Martin reported William saying, subsequently communicating via WhatsApp, according to the outlet.Martin said, ""That's how [William] works and he's very involved. There will be weekends when my WhatsApp messages will be in double figures and I will be very responsive.""""If something has gone well or badly, I will want to tell my boss and he’ll be straight back,"" he added.","Prince of Wales is making gradual changes to the traditional royal protocols to better fit the modern world.

Written on a Titanic letter card and postmarked in Queenstown and London, it is ominous in tone, with the following ominous words: ""It is a fine ship but I shall await my journey's end before I pass judgment on her.""Auctioneer Henry Aldridge and Son described it as ""a truly exceptional, museum-grade piece,"" saying it is the record price for a Titanic letter. Survivor letters of Gracie's stature are extremely rare, with this one never previously on the market.The four-page letter, written to a family acquaintance who befriended Gracie at the London Waldorf Hotel, is warm in its reminiscence about his earlier crossings on the Oceanic, remembering, ""Her sea-worthy qualities and yacht-like appearance make me miss her,"" while also marveling at the size of the Titanic.Days later, Gracie would be a participant in one of history's most horrific nights. Following an evening of squash, a dip in the ship's pool, and a Sunday church service, Gracie was rudely awakened at 11:40 pm by the abrupt shutdown of Titanic's engines. Without hesitation, he assisted women and children into lifeboats, procuring blankets to protect them from the cold.When the ship finally went down into the Atlantic waves, Gracie crawled onto an upturned collapsible boat with other survivors. In the blackness, frantic swimmers cried out for assistance, but fear of capsizing prevented those on board from taking on more. Gracie remembered with sorrow that over half the men holding on to the upturned boat died before dawn, exhausted and chilled.""In no instance, I am happy to say, did I hear any word of rebuke,"" Gracie wrote in his later memoir, The Truth About the Titanic, recounting the final moments of those left behind, some offering blessings rather than curses.Col. Gracie's eye-witness account is still one of the most detailed and graphic accounts of the tragedy. The auctioneers titled the letter an invaluable relic, ""It is impossible to overstate the rarity of this lot,"" they added.

The people in front of us (Pakistani protestors) are abusing us, but we are sitting here peacefully,"" he said.A heavy Metropolitan Police presence was observed, with numerous officers positioned between the two groups of demonstrators to maintain order.This comes only a day after a confrontation broke out outside the Pakistan high commission between the two protesting groups. Videos shared on social media by Indian community members from Friday evening’s demonstration showed a Pakistani diplomatic official making threatening gestures and taunting the protesters from the balcony of the mission building at Lowndes Square.At least one person was arrested after police officers pursued and detained a protester on charges of racial abuse.Meanwhile, tensions between the two nations have escalated with India accusing Pakistan of being involved in the Pahalgam terror attack and the latter denying the charge. Additionally, India, in retaliation, suspended Indus Water Treaty , closed its borders and cut off the trade ties with Pakistan.","London witnessed live India vs Pakistan drama when the diaspora members from both the nations took to streets. Waving their national flags, demonstrators lined opposite sides of the road, engaging in a heated slogan battle over the Pahalgam attack that claimed the lives of 25 Indians and one Nepalese citizen.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120672164,imgsize-1037413,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

Racist and antisemitic acts

Siphoning off far-right voters

PARIS: The French government is banning activist groups on the edges of the political spectrum as it tries to portray itself as the guardian of democracy against extremism. That's prompting accusations of Islamophobia from rivals on the left, and of plagiarism from the far right.And like much of French politics right now, the latest moves are intertwined with jockeying by political rivals ahead of 2027 presidential elections.Emmanuel Macron won't be able to stand for re-election in 2027 after serving as president for a maximum of two terms, and presidential hopefuls are trying to make the most of a highly inflammatory political context, both on the domestic and international stages.As extreme political forces made significant gains in recent parliamentary elections, leaving a fractured legislature, interior minister Bruno Retailleau , a senior member of the government who is eager to succeed Macron, is hitting out at various groups to show his credentials.On Wednesday, Retailleau confirmed plans for the dissolution of the Urgence Palestine group, a collective calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza which has accused Israel of genocide. During an interview with Europe 1-CNews, Retailleau said that banning the group was a blow to ""Islamism.""""Islamism is an ideology that tries to use a religion as a tool,"" he said. ""We need to hit Islamism so that we can protect our Muslim compatriots.""The planned dissolution of Urgence Palestine is the latest move in the French government's strategy to bring down groups deemed as extremists. Retailleau told the lower house of the Parliament this week that he started a similar procedure against a left-wing movement called the antifascist Young Guard.That group, which is supported by political figures from the hard left, was created in Lyon in response to the growing presence of far-right activists in the city. Retailleau said he is also seeking the dissolution of a group close to the ""ultra-right"" movement called Lyon Populaire.The interior minister is a hardline conservative working within the centrist government of prime minister Francois Bayrou. Retailleau is bidding to become the leader of Les Republicains and represent his party at the 2027 presidential election.Retailleau's announcements came on the eve of the May Day celebrations, which are often marred by violence on the sidelines of events marking International Workers' Day, and amid a surge in antisemitic and islamophobic incidents in Europe against the backdrop of the Israel-Hamas war.France's National Consultative Commission on Human Rights last year reported a 32% spike in racist incidents in 2023, and an ""unprecedented"" surge in antisemitic acts, up 284% from 2022. The report said the numbers were likely an undercount, given that many victims of racism don't file complaints.In this context, presidential contenders, including leftist challenger Jean-Luc Melenchon and far-right stalwarts Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella, are all playing their cards.Melenchon attended a rally in Paris last week after a man suspected of killing a Muslim worshipper in a French mosque in an attack that was described by Bayrou as described by Bayrou as Islamophobic. Melenchon was moved to tears after a woman told him how Muslims no longer feel safe in France and that a red line had been crossed.""That's for sure,"" replied Melenchon, who accused Retailleau of nurturing ""a climate of Islamophobia.""Melenchon in recent years has taken a clear stance in defense of Muslims, with many political rivals accusing him and his hard-left France Unbowed party of antisemitism. He strongly denies the accusations.On the other side of the spectrum, fearing that the current government's hardline stance on immigration and the fight against extremism could lead to a siphoning off of its voters, far-right leaders have accused Retailleau of just pretending to be tough.In February, after one person was killed and police officers injured in a knife attack in the eastern French city of Mulhouse conducted by a 37-year-old Algerian man, Bardella said Retailleau should either ""act or step down.""The suspect had arrived in France without papers and was arrested and convicted of glorifying terrorism in the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel. After several months in prison for that conviction, the suspect was confined to house arrest as authorities sought to expel him to Algeria.""Perhaps in order to please the National Rally electorate and right-wing voters, (Retailleau) is making more and more statements, except that the same things are happening over and over again,"" Bardella said.Retailleau, who will likely face stiff competition from rivals including former Prime Minister Edouard Philippe and Justice Minister Gerald Darmanin in his 2027 bid, has clearly made the fight against Islamism his rallying cry.His strategy of overtaking the far-right on its themes bears many similarities to Nicolas Sarkozy's successful presidential campaign in 2007, when he beat a Socialist rival in the second round of ballot to succeed Jacques Chirac after the far-right candidate Jean-Marie Le Pen was eliminated in the first round with just 10% of votes.","The French government is banning activist groups on the edges of the political spectrum.

The latest moves are intertwined with jockeying by political rivals ahead of 2027 presidential elections.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120768740,imgsize-507365,width-400,resizemode-4/Bruno-Retailleau-AP.jpg"
Ukraine poised to sign much anticipated mineral resources deal with the US on Wednesday,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/ukraine-poised-to-sign-much-anticipated-mineral-resources-deal-with-the-us-on-wednesday/articleshow/120766280.cms,"AP file photo

KYIV : Ukraine is prepared to sign a landmark mineral resources agreement with the United States in Washington on Wednesday, according to two senior Ukrainian officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss the matter publicly.Economy Minister Yulia Svyrydenko is currently in Washington for the final coordination of the agreement's technical details, the sources said.It wasn't immediately clear whether the Trump administration also was ready to ink the deal.Trump has said that he wants Ukraine's rare earth elements as a condition of further support in its more than three-year war with Russia.The Ukrainian Cabinet is expected to approve the agreement's text before the Washington meeting, after which it will be signed by an authorized government representative.The deal will then require ratification in the Ukrainian parliament before it can take effect.According to one of the Ukrainian officials, multiple documents are involved - including a main agreement and at least two technical accords outlining the structure and operations of the joint fund.The official said that the Ukrainian side is generally satisfied with how the agreement has evolved following negotiations between both teams.The other senior official expressed hope that there would be no further changes from Washington's side.Ukraine has introduced new provisions to the agreement, aiming to address earlier concerns that the initial US draft, presented in March, disproportionately favored American interests. Negotiations between the two sides have continued steadily since then.One industry official close to the discussions said that more ""details and not just declarations"" were added to the text.In Moscow, a senior Kremlin official said Wednesday that clinching a deal to end the Russia-Ukraine war ""is far too complex to be done quickly,"" as the US labors to bring momentum to peace efforts and expresses frustration over the slow progress.Meanwhile, a nighttime Russian drone attack on Ukraine's second-largest city of Kharkiv wounded at least 45 civilians, officials said. The United Nations reported that the number of Ukrainian civilian casualties in the more than three-year war has surged in recent weeks amid Washington's attempts to broker a peace agreement. Putin wants answers before committing to a ceasefire Russian President Vladimir Putin backs calls for a ceasefire before peace negotiations, ""but before it's done, it's necessary to answer a few questions and sort out a few nuances,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. Putin is also ready for direct talks with Ukraine without preconditions to seek a peace deal, he added.""We realize that Washington wants to achieve quick progress, but we hope for understanding that the Ukrainian crisis settlement is far too complex to be done quickly,"" Peskov said on his daily conference call with reporters. ""There are many details and an array of small nuances that need to be solved before a settlement.""US President Donald Trump has previously expressed frustration over the slow pace of progress in negotiations aimed at stopping the war, which he said he could end in the first 24 hours of his new administration in January. Western European leaders have accused Putin of stalling while his forces seek to grab more Ukrainian land. Russia has captured nearly a fifth of Ukraine's territory since Moscow's forces launched a full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022.Trump has chided Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for steps that he said were ""prolonging"" the ""killing field,"" and the US leader has rebuked Putin for complicating negotiations with ""very bad timing"" in launching deadly strikes that battered the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv.Trump has long dismissed the war as a waste of American taxpayer money and lives lost in the conflict. Senior US officials have warned that the administration could abandon the peace efforts if it sees no solution. That could spell an end to crucial military help for Ukraine and heavier economic sanctions on Russia.US wants both sides to move faster The US State Department on Tuesday tried again to push both sides to move more quickly.""We are now at a time where concrete proposals need to be delivered by the two parties on how to end this conflict,"" department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce quoted US secretary of state Marco Rubio as telling her.""How we proceed from here is a decision that belongs now to the president,"" she told reporters, relating a conversation that she had with Rubio. ""If there is no progress, we will step back as mediators in this process.""Russia has effectively rejected a US proposal for an immediate and full 30-day ceasefire, making it conditional on a halt to Ukraine's mobilization effort and Western arms supplies to Kyiv.Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov claimed Wednesday that Ukraine had accepted an unconditional truce only because it was being pushed back on the battlefield, where the bigger Russian forces have the upper hand.""In the context of the developments on the ground, along the front line where the Kyiv regime is increasingly in retreat, they have made an about-turn and started demanding an immediate ceasefire without any preconditions,"" Lavrov said at a briefing in Rio de Janeiro where he was attending a ministerial meeting of the BRICS grouping.He also suggested that Ukraine's ceasefire promises weren't credible. Both sides have accused each other of breaking previous truces. Independent verification of the battlefield claims wasn't possible.UN says Ukrainian civilian casualties are on the rise Meanwhile, Ukrainian civilians have been killed or wounded in attacks every day this year, according to a UN report presented Tuesday in New York.The UN Human Rights Office said in the report that in the first three months of this year, it had verified 2,641 civilian casualties in Ukraine. That was almost 900 more than during the same period last year.Also, between April 1-24, civilian casualties in Ukraine were up 46% from the same weeks in 2024, it said.The Ukrainian air force said that Russia fired 108 Shahed and decoy drones at Ukraine between Tuesday and Wednesday, predominantly at the cities of Dnipro and Kharkiv.Also Wednesday, the Ukrainian Security Service claimed its drones struck the Murom Instrument Engineering Plant in Russia's Vladimir region overnight, causing five explosions and a fire.The plant located east of Moscow produces ammunition ignition devices, as well as components and products for the Russian Navy and military aviation, a source at the agency told Associated Press. The source spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the attack.The claim could not be independently verified.","Ukraine prepared to sign mineral resources agreement with U.S. in Washington, officials say. It wasn't immediately clear whether the Trump administration also was ready to ink the deal. Russia has captured nearly a fifth of Ukraine's territory since Moscow's invasion in February 2012.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120766853,imgsize-832224,width-400,resizemode-4/AP-file-photo.jpg"

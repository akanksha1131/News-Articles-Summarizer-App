‘CITY THAT DEVOURS MAYORS’: Zohran Mamdani Faces BRUTAL Reality Of Running NYC | EXPLAINED





US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that New York City’s mayor-elect, Zohran “Kwame” Mamdani, will meet him at the Oval Office on Friday, 21 November.In a post on Truth Social, the president wrote: “Communist Mayor of New York City, Zohran ‘Kwame’ Mamdani, has asked for a meeting. We have agreed that this meeting will take place at the Oval Office on Friday, November 21st. Further details to follow!”The meeting comes after months of sharp public clashes between the two leaders.According to The New York Times, Mamdani’s team reached out to White House officials last week to arrange a meeting revolving around New York’s affordability crisis, a move that marks a noticeable shift in tone.During his campaign, the mayor-elect had described Trump as a threat to democracy and argued that only he had the “backbone” to stand up to him.Trump, meanwhile, repeatedly labelled him a “100 per cent communist lunatic” and backed his rival, Andrew M Cuomo.Despite their differences, Mamdani has said he is willing to meet the president to address New York’s affordability crisis, as per The New York Times.He has argued that soaring living costs — including groceries and rent — are pushing residents out of the city. Speaking at a Bronx food pantry, he said that while voters were drawn to Trump’s promises to reduce costs, “we are seeing his actions and that of his administration in Washington leading to the exact opposite effect for New Yorkers.”As per The Guardian, Mamdani has stressed he is open to working with “anyone and everyone” if it benefits the city’s 8.5 million residents.When asked what he would say to Trump, Mamdani responded, “I’m here to work for the benefit of everyone that calls this city home, and wherever there is a possibility for working together towards that end, I’m ready, and if it’s to the expense of those New Yorkers, I will fight it.”In an earlier interview, he said the relationship with the White House would be “critical to the success of the city” and that he planned to be “proactive” as he prepares to take office on 1 January.The meeting will take place at a tense moment for New York City. According to NYT, city leaders have been preparing for possible clashes with the federal government after the president threatened to send National Guard troops and explored using a Staten Island Coast Guard facility to detain immigrants.Trump has also withheld billions in federal aid and suggested he could pull more.As the two prepare to meet, Mamdani has maintained that while he is ready to cooperate where possible, he will oppose any action that harms New Yorkers. As quoted by The Guardian, he said recently, “I’m here to work for the benefit of everyone that calls this city home… and if it’s to the expense of those New Yorkers, I will fight it.”","President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that New York City’s mayor-elect, Zohran ‘Kwame’ Mamdani, will meet him at the Oval Office on Friday, 21 November.

Under mounting pressure: Donald Trump signs bill to release Epstein files — what do they contain?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/under-mounting-pressure-donald-trump-signs-bill-to-release-epstein-files-what-do-they-contain/articleshow/125451040.cms,"Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein (File photo)

Historic 427-1 Vote: Bill To Expose Epstein Files Passes In House; Who Said What, Senate Test Next

What are Epstein Files?





US President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced that he has signed the Epstein Files Transparency Act. The bill directs the Justice Department to publicly release all files related to disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.The legislation passed the US House of Representatives on Tuesday by an overwhelming 427–1 vote and was cleared by the Senate on Wednesday morning.In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump wrote: “ I have signed the bill to release the Epstein Files!""The President’s post accused several high-profile Democratic figures including former President Bill Clinton, economist Larry Summers, investor Reid Hoffman and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of having close ties with Epstein. He alleged that the documents could reveal more about those relationships once they are released.""Jeffrey Epstein, who was charged by the Trump Justice Department in 2019 (Not the Democrats!), was a lifelong Democrat, donated Thousands of Dollars to Democrat Politicians, and was deeply associated with many well-known Democrat figures, such as Bill Clinton (who traveled on his plane 26 times), Larry Summers (who just resigned from many Boards, including Harvard), Sleazebag Political Activist Reid Hoffman, Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (who asked Epstein to donate to his Campaign after Epstein was charged), Democrat Congresswoman Stacey Plaskett, and many more,"" he further wrote in his post.Trump also claimed credit for the bill’s swift passage through Congress and used the announcement to sharply criticize Democrats, asserting that they were trying to “deflect” from Republican achievements.He also criticised former President Joe Biden alleging that under his tenure, the Justice Department did not release any documents related to Epstein or address his case publicly.""Do not forget — The Biden Administration did not turn over a SINGLE file or page related to Democrat Epstein, nor did they ever even speak about him.,"" he wrote.Trump’s endorsement of the bill marks a reversal of his earlier stance. For months, he had resisted expanding access to the files, calling the matter a “Democrat hoax.” However, he shifted position earlier this week as it became clear the House would pass the legislation, saying Republicans had “nothing to hide”.The “Epstein files” are a large set of documents and evidence collected during investigations into financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. These include flight logs, contact lists, witness statements, correspondence and records of his travel and finances. The files contain the names of several well-known individuals who had social or business links with Epstein.Many of these materials have remained sealed or heavily redacted for years, leading to growing demands for full disclosure. Survivors of Epstein’s abuse, along with lawmakers, have urged authorities to release the files, saying transparency is crucial after repeated failures by federal agencies.Under the newly signed bill, the Attorney General must release unclassified Epstein-related records within 30 days, with redactions only to protect victims’ identities, sensitive content and ongoing investigations, as reported by the Guardian.The House Oversight Committee has already made public tens of thousands of pages that highlight Epstein’s network of political, financial and global connections. His ties also extended to the United Kingdom, where Prince Andrew was stripped of royal titles amid public pressure.Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein were once socially acquainted and photographed together in the early 2000s. Trump has stated he ended contact with Epstein long before his 2008 conviction and has denied any wrongdoing, even as earlier email releases showed Epstein referencing Trump in private communications.",US President Donald Trump has signed the Epstein Files Transparency Act.

Who is Tom Steyer? Billionaire climate crusader announces run for California governor,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-tom-steyer-billionaire-climate-crusader-announces-run-for-california-governor/articleshow/125447427.cms,"A billionaire activist with deep political roots

From presidential hopeful to California contender

An agenda centred on affordability and reform

A crowded Democratic field – and rising Republican challenges





Tom Steyer, the billionaire environmental activist and one of the Democratic party’s biggest political donors, has announced his bid for California governor, joining a rapidly expanding field looking to replace the termed-out Gavin Newsom. Steyer, who previously ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020, said he is entering the race to tackle what he calls the state’s “intractable affordability crisis”.Steyer, 68, built his fortune in finance after founding Farallon Capital Management in 1986, turning it into one of the world’s most influential hedge funds. But he left the firm in 2012 to devote himself full-time to political and environmental causes. He went on to create NextGen America, a youth-focused voter mobilisation organisation centred on climate change, reproductive rights and progressive policy.He has since become one of the largest donors to Democratic candidates and initiatives across the US, spending millions on campaigns and ballot measures.Steyer’s most high-profile political moment came in 2020 when he sought the Democratic nomination for president.His campaign emphasised climate action, corporate accountability and economic fairness, but he dropped out after finishing behind Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders in the South Carolina primary.In the years since, he has remained deeply involved in California politics. He spent more than $12m supporting the state’s recent redistricting measure and has championed legislation aimed at raising the tobacco tax, closing corporate tax loopholes, and funding healthcare programmes. His political résumé also includes leading statewide campaigns that target oil, tobacco and out-of-state corporations.Announcing his candidacy, Steyer pledged sweeping reforms designed to ease the cost-of-living crisis gripping the state. He has promised to lower utility bills, build one million homes within four years, make pre-school and community college free, and ban corporate PAC money in California elections.“Californians deserve a life they can afford,” he said. “The people who make this state run are being run over by rising costs. It’s time corporations paid their fair share again.”With Gavin Newsom unable to run again, the Democratic field is unusually packed. Contenders include former congresswoman Katie Porter, former US cabinet member Xavier Becerra, former Los Angeles mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, and former state controller Betty Yee. Congressman Eric Swalwell is also expected to join the race.Porter had previously been viewed as the frontrunner until a damaging video incident in October, after which Republican challenger Chad Bianco, the Riverside county sheriff, surged in polls. Another prominent Republican, former Fox News host Steve Hilton, is also in the running.","Steyer, 68, built his fortune in finance after founding Farallon Capital Management in 1986.

Who is Jessica Tisch? NYPD commissioner with anti-crime focus working amid Mamdani’s police reform plans,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-jessica-tisch-nypd-commissioner-with-anti-crime-focus-working-amid-mamdanis-police-reform-plans/articleshow/125447417.cms,"In a bold move ahead of his January inauguration, Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani has confirmed Jessica Tisch as NYPD Commissioner. This choice, while reflecting their divergent views on policing, underscores a shared commitment to enhancing public safety and reducing crime.

HISTORIC: Zohran Mamdani Elected New York City's First Indian-American Muslim Mayor





New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani announced on Wednesday that Jessica Tisch has accepted his offer to remain as commissioner of the NYPD, securing one of his highest-profile appointments ahead of taking office in January.Tisch was appointed by outgoing mayor Eric Adams and has led the nation’s largest police force through a record drop in crime, including reductions in shootings and homicides.“Leading this department is the greatest privilege of my life, and I am proud to continue doing it,” Tisch wrote in a letter to the NYPD obtained by CNN. “Now, do the Mayor-elect and I agree on everything? No, we don’t. But in speaking with him, it’s clear that we share broad and crucial priorities: the importance of public safety, the need to continue driving down crime, and the need to maintain stability and order across the department. We also agree that you deserve the city’s respect and support.”The decision required compromise from both Tisch and Mamdani, both of them have differing views on policing. Mamdani once supported defunding the police and later apologised to officers during his mayoral run. Tisch is known as a technocrat who has pushed to roll back criminal justice reforms.On Wednesday, Mamdani and Tisch appeared together at the Fallen Heroes Memorial in Lower Manhattan.They were joined by officers who shook hands with the mayor-elect while paying tribute to those killed in the line of duty. “I appreciate the moments I just shared with Commissioner Tisch and a number of officers here with us to pay our respects to NYPD officers who lost their lives in the line of duty and to learn a little bit more about the names that so many New Yorkers have come to know,” Mamdani said.Tisch praised the visit as meaningful, saying, “To me it is very meaningful that he asked to come here as our first public venture to visit the memorial.”Mamdani’s proposed reforms include creating a Department of Community Safety to respond to non-violent emergency calls such as mental health crises, domestic violence, and homelessness. He suggested Tisch supports the plan. “It’s untenable for officers to be asked to respond to the 200,000 mental health calls they receive every year… The commissioner and I share a belief that in order for police officers to be able to do their jobs we also need to create a Department of Community Safety,” he said.Despite Tisch’s acceptance, concerns persist among NYPD officers about morale and retention. Police union leaders have warned of rising departures, citing a 35 per cent increase in October compared to last year.Tisch is an heiress to the Loews family fortune and previously served as commissioner of the sanitation department and the city’s chief technology officer. She has overseen efforts to remove thousands of illegal guns from city streets and has avoided commenting on politics or the mayoral race during the campaign.",Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani announced on Wednesday that Jessica Tisch has accepted his offer to remain as commissioner of the NYPD.

Controversy erupted after the Streamer Awards announced itsnominations, with xQc securing a spot while Hasan was entirely excluded. The decision immediately sparked debate across social platforms, where fans and creators questioned whether the nominations reflected genuine streaming contributions or behind-the-scenes preferences shaping the final list.Hasan expressed disappointment at being overlooked despite streaming hours of daily commentary, arguing his consistent format aligns more closely with the category than xQc’s sporadic chat-focused content. His frustration intensified after viewers pointed to xQc’s briefmoment with Donald Trump, a viral clip many felt hardly represented typicalcontent.The drama intensified when Asmongold stepped in, offering a more grounded explanation of how nomination decisions are made. He clarified that xQc’s Trump clip was not equivalent to Hasan’s daily political programming and wasn’t the determining factor behind the nomination. Instead, Asmongold suggested the awards often consider broader industry factors like brand safety, marketability, and committee preferences, which can outweigh pure content volume or consistency.Asmongold stated that Hasan’s hours of political streaming undoubtedly fit themold, but his outspoken stances may make him a riskier choice for organizers aiming for mainstream appeal.In contrast, xQc, despite occasionally diving into controversial spaces, remains one of the most recognizable and widely palatable figures in streaming, making him a safer option for high-visibility award categories. This explanation resonated with some fans, who agreed the awards frequently lean toward creators with broader commercial value rather than those who simply stream the most relevant content.The debate quickly expanded, with viewers questioning whether award shows can ever truly reflect merit when market positioning plays such a significant role. Critics argued that leaving Hasan off the list undermines the credibility of a category meant to celebrate conversational streamers, while supporters of xQc noted that popularity and cultural impact remain major factors in any entertainment award.As conversations continue, the dispute underscores a long-standing tension in the streaming world: the gap between community expectations and the opaque criteria used by award institutions. Whether Hasan’s absence is seen as an oversight or a strategic decision, the controversy has once again highlighted how subjective and politically influenced nomination processes can be, especially in categories as broad and competitive asAlso Read: Adin Ross to take legal action after Cuffem suffers major head injury at Carti concert","The Streamer Awards announced its nominations, with xQc securing a spot while Hasan was entirely excluded.

US President Donald Trump came under fire after rolling out the red carpet for Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Senator Bernie Sanders said Trump hates Muslims, except the rich ones.Sanders posted on X: “Trump dislikes Muslims, except those who are billionaire autocrats who can make his family even richer.”The visit was the first by the Saudi ruler to the United States since the 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. It featured one of the most lavish welcomes of Trump’s presidency. The POTUS greeted bin Salman with a military flyover, cannon fire, a horse parade, and a gala on the South Lawn.The reception became tense in the Oval Office during a moment when a reporter questioned Trump about the family’s business interests in Saudi Arabia and the crown prince’s alleged role in Khashoggi’s murder. Trump snapped and called the reporter ""worst"": “You don’t have to embarrass our guest. One of the worst in the business. I have devoted 100% of my energy. My family has done very little with Saudi Arabia. He’s (Prince) done a phenomenal job… He knew nothing about [Khashoggi].Bin Salman addressed the allegations and called the killing “painful” and “a huge mistake.” He asserted that Saudi authorities had improved investigative systems to prevent future incidents. He also described the deaths of 9/11 victims as “painful” and argued critics were aiding Osama bin Laden’s purpose.Trump went further in his praise of the crown prince, calling his work “incredible — in human rights and in other areas,” despite US intelligence reports implicating him in Khashoggi’s murder. Alongside the Oval Office meetings, a state dinner hosted by first lady Melania Trump and upcoming announcements on defence and commercial agreements, including F-35 fighter jets and AI infrastructure investments.","US President Donald Trump welcomed Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

Visa Breach Ends India Visit for Blacklisted UK Scholar and Hindi Literature Expert Francesca Orsini





: PoK-origin UK home secretary Shabana Mahmood announced Monday that Trump-style visa bans will be imposed on countries unless they accept the return of their criminals and illegal immigrants, as she revealed further sweeping reforms to tackle illegal immigration.The first countries to face such a ban are Angola, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of Congo whose nationals will no longer be granted UK visas unless their govts rapidly improve cooperation on removals. “These countries face penalties for their unacceptably low co-operation and obstructive returns processes. Thousands of illegal migrants and criminals from these nations are currently in the UK,” the home office said.Non-cooperation includes embassies failing to process removals paperwork in time and requiring individuals to sign their own documentation — allowing them to block their own deportation.India is thought to be one of several other countries most resistant to taking back illegal migrants and could join the list over the coming year, the Times (UK) reported.Human rights laws will also be overhauled to scale up deportations and prevent migrants from “gaming the system”.UK’s govt will legislate to reform how Article 8 (the right to family and private life) is interpreted by the courts to make clear a family connection means immediate family, such as a parent or child — blocking people from using dubious connections to stay in the UK. It will also work with partners at the Council of Europe to address the “over-expansive application” of Article 3 (protection against inhuman and degrading treatments) which migrants are also using to block their removal and introduce new legislation to crack down on “migrants making last-minute bogus modern slavery claims”. Migrants will be restricted to arguing all legal grounds within a single appeal and, if they lose, they will be forced to leave.New capped work and study routes for genuine refugees will be created who will be referred through partners such as the UNHCR. British people will be encouraged to house them, as they have done for Ukrainians, to end the reliance on asylum hotels, which cost £2.1 billion in 2024-2025.In the year ending June 2025 a total of 5,475 Indian nationals claimed asylum in the UK making them the sixth-largest nationality. Of these, 346 Indians arrived by small boat illegally. The other Indians were mostly on visas, with student visas being the most common. The top nationality to claim asylum was Pakistani; followed by nationals from Afghanistan, Iran, Eritrea and Bangladesh.Only 20 Indians were granted asylum in the year ending June 2025, and 2,691 had their claims refused.","Angola, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of Congo will face visa bans unless they accept the return of their criminals and illegal immigrants.

‘Desperate’ For Saudi-Israel Ties, Trump 'IGNORES' Pentagon's China Threat; Okays 48 F-35 Jets Deal





US President Donald Trump said on Monday that his administration would move ahead with the long-anticipated sale of F-35 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia, despite internal concerns that the deal could expose sensitive American technology to China.When asked whether he would approve the sale, Trump said, “I will say that we will be doing that. We’ll be selling F-35s.”The announcement came a day before Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s expected arrival in Washington, his first US visit in over seven years. The F-35 deal is among several major agreements the two countries are likely to unveil during the visit, according to AP.The crown prince is expected to seek formal US assurances on military protection for the kingdom and the purchase of the F-35, one of the world’s most advanced fighter jets.The timing of the announcement also reflects Trump’s push to secure a normalisation deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel. He has promoted an expansion of the Abraham Accords as key to long-term regional stability while the fragile Gaza ceasefire holds. “I hope that Saudi Arabia will be going into the Abraham Accords very shortly,” he told reporters on Air Force One on Friday.However, Saudi Arabia has maintained that any deal must include a guaranteed pathway to a Palestinian state, a position Israel firmly rejects.Officials say Riyadh is unlikely to join the accords immediately, though there is guarded optimism about a possible agreement by the end of Trump’s second term.The New York Times reported that a Pentagon intelligence assessment raised fresh concerns that China could gain access to sensitive F-35 technology if the sale proceeds. Sources familiar with the Defence Intelligence Agency’s findings said US officials fear potential Chinese espionage and Beijing’s growing security cooperation with Riyadh. Washington has also been evaluating whether the sale would affect Israel’s qualitative military edge, given Israel is the only Middle Eastern country operating F-35s and has used them in strikes in Iran in October 2024 and June 2025.Bradley Bowman of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies said Congress may now seek clarity on what assurances Riyadh has offered regarding its ties with China. He added that lawmakers are likely to press the administration on how it plans to maintain Israel’s military advantage in the region.",US President Donald Trump said on Monday that his administration would move ahead with the long-anticipated sale of F-35 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia.

Trump 'knew about the underage girls'?











Mark Epstein, the brother of the late pedophile Jeffrey Epstein , has tried to shut down a viral rumour about the newly released Epstein emails. He said that the name “Bubba” mentioned in a 2018 exchange between the brothers was not a reference to former President Bill Clinton.The clarification came after a March 2018 email between Jeffrey and Mark Epstein was released this week by Democrats, which stirred a row. In the message, Mark asked Jeffrey, who had said he was with Steve Bannon, to “ask him if Putin has the photos of Trump b*****g Bubba.” Because Clinton was long known by the nickname “Bubba”, the reference was speculated by many as Trump having oral intercourse with Clinton.Mark Epstein pushed back in a statement to The Advocate, saying the message was being misread. “They were simply part of a humorous private exchange between two brothers and were never meant for public release or to be interpreted as serious remarks,” he wrote. He added, “For the avoidance of doubt, the reference to ‘Bubba’ in this correspondence is not, in any way, a reference to former President Bill Clinton.”Mark's spokesperson, Ali Clark, said in an email that Bubba is “a private individual who is not a public figure.”Mark said that attaching political motives to a nickname distracts from “the serious questions that remain unanswered.”The wider set of emails points to far more serious claims about Jeffrey Epstein’s political ties with the MAGA chief. In a 2019 message to author Michael Wolff, Epstein wrote that Trump “knew about the girls as he asked Ghislaine to stop.” Another email from 2011, sent to Ghislaine Maxwell, claimed that Trump spent hours at Epstein’s home with one of his sex-trafficking victims.California Representative Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, said the documents raise “serious new questions” about Trump’s ties to Epstein and accused the Justice Department of obstructing the inquiry. “There’s a massive cover-up at the White House and the DOJ right now over the files.”The White House has dismissed the emails, with press secretary Karoline Leavitt rejecting any suggestion of Trump being involved in the Epstein scandal.Meanwhile, Trump also claimed that Bill Clinton spent significant time on Epstein’s island and threatened to launch an FBI and DOJ probe into various high-profile figures, including JPMorgan and Chase.The row intensified on Friday when Trump launched a Truth Social rant attacking Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene after she backed a bipartisan move to force the release of all unclassified Epstein files.","Mark Epstein, the brother of the late pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, has tried to shut down a viral rumour about the newly released Epstein emails.

On Cam: Dem Lawmaker’s ‘Texts’ With Epstein Inside U.S. Cong Sparks Fury; Explosive Plaskett Link





Former Harvard University president and US treasury secretary Larry Summers has said he will step back from several public roles following the release of documents detailing years of personal correspondence with convicted sex offender and disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.In a statement issued by him on Monday night, quoted by The Washington Post, Summers said he was “deeply ashamed” of maintaining contact with Epstein and accepted full responsibility for what he called a “misguided” decision. He said he would continue his teaching duties but would retreat from other commitments as part of an effort to rebuild trust and mend ties with people close to him.“I am deeply ashamed of my actions and recognize the pain they have caused,” Summers said. “I take full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr. Epstein. While continuing to fulfill my teaching obligations, I will be stepping back from public commitments as one part of my broader effort to rebuild trust and repair relationships with the people closest to me”, he added.His announcement comes in the wake of the House Oversight Committee’s release of a fresh set of documents detailing Epstein’s extensive interactions with political leaders, influential figures and long-time associates.While much public attention focused on Epstein’s comments about Donald Trump, the material also shed light on his communications with Summers.According to a report by The Guardian, emails exchanged between the two from 2013 to early 2019 show Epstein and Summers discussing politics, personal matters and Summers’s own relationships. In several of the exchanges, Epstein offered advice on Summers’s attempts to pursue a woman. The final messages were sent only months before Epstein’s arrest.The Centre for American Progress said Summers was no longer a fellow and confirmed that the planned launch of an economic working group he was to help lead had been put on hold as Summers continued to remain under public scrutiny. The Yale Budget Lab said he had withdrawn from its advisory group. Other organisations with which he is affiliated, including economic think tanks, did not immediately issue public comments.Summers, who served as Harvard University president from 2001 to 2006 and continues as a professor, faced renewed calls for the university to distance itself. Senator Elizabeth Warren, herself an emerita Harvard professor, told CNN that the institution should sever ties. Harvard did not respond to requests for comment.Epstein donated more than $9 million to Harvard and its affiliated programmes between 1998 and 2008 and briefly held a visiting fellowship that the university later found he was unqualified for.Summers has previously acknowledged regretting his dealings with Epstein. The release of the latest documents has revived scrutiny over the depth and duration of their relationship.","Larry Summers has said he will step back from several public roles following the release of documents detailing years of personal correspondence with disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.

"Sheikh Hasina sentenced to death, Dhaka reiterates extradition call; India non-committal",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/death-penalty-for-hasina-dhaka-wants-her-back/articleshow/125398370.cms,"Ousted Bangladesh PM Hasina Calls ICT’s Death Sentence ‘Rigged’, Says It Denied Fair Trial Rights

.

.





Deposed Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina was Monday sentenced to death in absentia for the violent 2024 student crackdown by a special tribunal in a verdict that she described as a foregone conclusion. Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus hailed the verdict saying no one is above the law.Hasina had called the tribunal a kangaroo court and, as she told ToI before the verdict, one that was controlled by her political adversaries looking to deflect attention from their governance failures.India responded to Hasina’s sentencing with caution as it said in a statement that it had taken note of the verdict by the ""International Crimes Tribunal of Bangladesh” and, as a close neighbour, remained committed to the best interests of the people of Bangladesh, including in peace, democracy, inclusion and stability in that country.“We will always engage constructively with all stakeholders to that end,’’ said the external affairs ministry in a statement, giving nothing away on Dhaka’s renewal of its demand immediately after the sentencing for the extradition of the deposed PM who remains in India.The government has so far only acknowledged the interim government’s call for her extradition, while remaining non-committal on what it proposes to do about it.That has been its position since December last year, when Dhaka officially sought her extradition, and it’s unlikely to comply with any such request in haste now as Hasina’s dramatic death sentencing does little to change the situation on the ground as far as India is concerned.The 2013 extradition treaty with Dhaka in any case may provide immunity to Hasina from any political witch hunt. Article 6 of the treaty states that extradition can be refused if the offence for which it is requested is of a political character. While Dhaka will argue that the same article excludes murder from the list of such offences, Article 8 also states that a person may not be extradited if he can convince the requested state that the accusations against him were not made in good faith “in the interests of justice”.In short, extradition would be a complex and long-drawn-out process and, for India, entail both legal commitments and geopolitical considerations. The sentencing will likely only add another layer of complexity to Hasina’s case. As an aspiring great power, India would not like to be seen as giving up on a longtime ally who remained attuned to India’s economic and security interests, not least by keeping in check radical Islamists. Abandoning Hasina would also not just demoralise Hasina’s party Awami League, which is facing a ban from participating in the upcoming elections, but also energize radical anti-India forces.The unelected interim government has also done little to assuage India’s concerns about increasing radicalisation and safety and security of minority communities. India also knows that Dhaka’s ongoing efforts to revive the relationship with Pakistan can act as real conundrum for India soon, even as it engages the interim government by hosting the Bangladesh NSA for a security conclave this week.More than the fate of Hasina perhaps, India will be concerned about what the verdict might mean for Awami League as it seeks free, fair and inclusive polls in the country. Hasina told ToI last week that the ban came from an unelected cadre that seized power and now wanted to take its political opponents out of the game.“It was the Awami League that introduced key reforms to ensure transparency and fairness, including- the use of photo-based voter lists, see-through ballot boxes, and the establishment of an independent election commission. There is an irony that the only party which ensured free elections is now barred from participating,” she said. For India too, it’s imperative that Awami League be allowed to contest elections that are genuinely fair and inclusive.","Deposed Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina was Monday sentenced to death in absentia for the violent 2024 student crackdown.

New bike infrastructure aims to ease congestion

A push for smarter and greener travel





New York City has identified a series of Gridlock Alert Days for 2025 that mark the periods when traffic congestion reaches its absolute peak. These dates typically align with major city events and seasonal travel surges that historically cause severe delays. The DOT is urging New Yorkers to avoid driving on these high-congestion days and instead use public transport, cycling or walking whenever possible.The term gridlock, coined in New York City, refers to the kind of extreme congestion that clogs intersections and brings traffic to a standstill. This remains a familiar sight in Manhattan’s busiest corridors. Despite the city’s heavy vehicle load, most New Yorkers rely on alternatives including the 24/7 subway system, buses, regional rail, ferries, cycling routes and pedestrian networks.Gridlock Alert Days are intended to help travellers plan ahead, reduce unnecessary driving and ease pressure on some of the densest traffic zones in the United States.The DOT has identified the following dates as the most congestion heavy of the year:Alongside its traffic alerts, the NYC DOT highlighted progress on one of its major cycling upgrades, the First Avenue Tunnel protected bike lane, completed last autumn. This permanent lane, inspired by a successful temporary UNGA bike route, runs through the tunnel near the United Nations headquarters and is the first tunnel in the United States to be repurposed for bicycle traffic while still allowing vehicle use.With a sturdy barrier separating cyclists from cars, the lane provides a safer, express style route that bypasses busy intersections. It has also helped streamline vehicle movement by organising traffic inside the tunnel and on the avenue above.Between improved cycling infrastructure, transit accessibility and detailed gridlock forecasting, the DOT is encouraging New Yorkers to rethink their travel patterns on the city’s busiest days. Whether commuting for work, running errands or travelling for recreation, residents are being advised to leave the car at home whenever possible.","New York City has identified a series of Gridlock Alert Days for 2025 that mark the periods when traffic congestion reaches its peak.

It's also funny that out of all the people that Trump sued for lying he didn't sue Elon

Sometimes you gotta fold for the greater good. Musk trying to close contracts and expand into Saudi Arabia with Starlink. These aren’t our conversations.

Don’t like Elon at all - but him and everyone else are there bc we live in a corrupt a** country where trump rewards those who kiss the ring and punishes those who don’t.

Well, Musk is in the files too. And when he isn't crashing out on ketamine, he remembers that and decides working with the admin for protection is his best play.

He has a bad habit of 'pedo' accusations against someone he's mad at.

Brown nosing to get his name redacted too.





A row erupted after Elon Musk attended a White House dinner with US President Donald Trump, months after publicly accusing him of being named in the Jeffrey Epstein files.The controversy began when Musk posted a message on X in June claiming that Trump appeared in the Epstein documents and that this was the real reason the files had not yet been released. He even told followers to “mark this post for the future.” Within hours, Musk deleted the message without explanation. Netizens questioned whether the billionaire was backing away from his claim or had received legal advice.The White House had earlier described Musk’s comments as “unfortunate,” noting that the president had already indicated he would sign legislation requiring the Justice Department to release all unclassified records related to Epstein and his associates.Musk’s appearance at the White House dinner has therefore struck many as contradictory. The event was held in honour of visiting dignitaries and attended by business leaders. It saw Musk seated alongside senior officials and industry figures.Social media users were quick to point out the irony of the world’s richest man sharing a table with Trump shortly after effectively accusing him of hiding evidence.The two men have had an increasingly tense public relationship.The MAGA chief and the Tesla CEO were once viewed as occasional allies, but that has deteriorated amid policy disagreements, clashes over spending priorities, and Musk’s criticism of certain White House decisions. Trump, for his part, has grown irritated with Musk’s unpredictability and willingness to provoke.The ex-DOGE lead was named in the Epstein files in September, according to the BBC. Musk has denied claims that he ever visited Epstein’s private island, arguing that the allegations were part of a smear campaign. He has maintained that his posts calling for transparency are consistent with his long-standing stance on open information.",The Tesla CEO attended a White House dinner with US President Donald Trump.

Pearls before swine: Trump pigs out on epithets,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/pearls-before-swine-trump-pigs-out-on-epithets/articleshow/125444481.cms,"TOI correspondent from Washington

On Cam: Trump SNAPS At Female Reporter, Calls Her ‘PIGGY’ For Asking Question On Epstein Files





: Growing tensions between the Trump White House and the largely liberal Washington press corps reached a flashpoint this week after the MAGA boss directed a crude insult toward a female journalist and threatened to revoke the license of a broadcast network whose reporter asked him tough questions.The first episode unfolded on November 14 on Air Force One when Bloomberg reporter Catherine Lucey, traveling with the President, pressed him on the release of the Epstein files. A clearly irked Trump raised his index finger and snapped: “Quiet! Quiet, piggy!” – a slur that reverberated across the media world.In a subsequent episode at the White House on Tuesday, Trump unloaded on ABC reporter Mary Bruce, who bluntly questioned him about the appropriateness of his family doing business in Saudi Arabia while he is President, and then directed a question to the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman regarding the U.S. intelligence conclusion that he orchestrated the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.A furious Trump told her not to ""embarrass our guest by asking a question like that,"" as he erupted at her network ABC, calling it ""fake news"" and ""one of the worst in the business.""When an unflustered Bruce followed up by asking why he should be waiting for Congress to release the Epstein files when he could do it himself, Trump lost his cool, complaining about her “attitude, and calling her a “terrible reporter.”He then wondered if the license of the Bruce’s network ABC should be taken away because “your news is so fake,” going so far as to suggest he would ask the FCC chair to look into it.The latest confrontations and insults fit squarely within Trump’s well-documented playbook of using epithets and bullying to control and dominate media interactions, particularly where it involves women. Since his entry into national politics, he has systematically deployed gendered slurs to undermine female crtiics who challenge his narratives, going back to the ""Nasty Woman"" epithet he deployed against Hillary Clinton during a 2016 debate, calling Senator Elizabeth Warren “Pocohontos,” followed by “cackling Kamala” against Kamala Harris.Journalists like Megyn Kelly, Mika Brzezinski, and April Ryan have all been subjected to highly personal, often appearance-based, or vaguely sexualized slurs from the President, demonstrating a consistent tactical choice: when confronted by a woman asking an inconvenient question, pivot immediately to personal humiliation and denigration to deflect from the subject.Although the White House Correspondents’ Association has affirmed the necessity of asking tough questions and condemned the use of ""demeaning and unprofessional language,” most White House reporters, no angels by any account, swallow the slights to remain on the beat and maintain access in a job that has become increasingly challenging.The White House on its part has tried to overcome the liberal mainstream media’s tough posture with a makeover of the press corps, drafting several MAGA influencers whose softball questions and sycophancy would be the envy of the North Korean leader.Since his entry into national politics, Trump has manufactured hundreds of disparaging monikers for his opponents, including men. His political rogues’ gallery includes “Lyin’ Ted Cruz,” “Liddle’ Marco Rubio,” “Pencil Neck Adam Schiff,” and, “Crooked Joe Biden.” More recently critics have tried to respond likewise, for instance, calling him ""Cheeto"" ""Felonious Trump"" and “Dozing Donald” after he was seen napping during a White House event. But none of the nicknames have stuck to Teflon Don.","The President snapped at a female reporter who asked him tough questions about the release of the Epstein files.

A woman who says she was abused by Jeffrey Epstein has claimed that the late pedophile had a severely deformed and unusually small p***s, describing it as “the shape of a lemon”.46-year-old Rina Oh made the claim in a recent Substack interview with writer Tina Brown, adding new detail to long-standing rumours surrounding Epstein’s appearance, reports the New York Post.“He had an extremely deformed p***s,” Oh said. “Some people have described it as the shape of an egg. I think it was more of the shape of a lemon, and it was really small when it was fully erect. It was probably like two inches.”Descriptions of Epstein’s genitals first surfaced publicly in 2009 during a civil lawsuit when a lawyer questioned him directly on the matter. In the newly resurfaced footage, the attorney asked: “Is it true, sir, that you have what is described as an egg-shaped p***s?” Epstein’s legal team immediately objected, threatening to end the deposition if the questioning continued. Before the session was stopped, the lawyer added: “One witness described your p***s as oval-shaped, it was thick towards the bottom but was thin and small towards the head portion and called it egg-shaped. ”Oh suggested Epstein’s physical insecurity may have been the cause of his predatory behaviour. She alleges she was drawn into Epstein’s circle in 2000 after he and Epstein's right-hand woman Ghislaine Maxwell pretended to take interest in her artwork. She also claimed the pair’s relationship was chaotic and filled with jealousy. “Their relationship was very awful, very strange,” she said.",46-year-old Rina Oh made the claim in a recent Substack interview with writer Tina Brown.

He shared with CNN, that the vote vindicates the value of his long relationship with Republicans and his willingness to talk to almost any party.But before his candidacy for the presidency can be considered, here are some details about him that you must know.Rohit Khanna, 45, is an Indian-origin American politician and attorney who is the representative of California's 17th District in the 117th Congress. He was elected to Congress in 2016 and is now serving his third term representing a district that covers the esteemed Silicon Valley.Prior to this, he was a Lecturer in the Department of Economics at Stanford University and Adjunct Professor at Santa Clara Law School. He is also an author with two published books, 'Entrepreneurial Nation: Why Manufacturing is Still Key to America’s Future' and 'Dignity in a Digital Age'.Ro Khanna was born in September 1976 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to Indian immigrant parents from a Punjabi Hindu family. His father is a chemical engineer while his mother is a former schoolteacher. His maternal grandfather, Amarnath Vidyalankar, was from Bhera city in the Shahpur District of Punjab province, British India.

Political Quake On Capitol Hill As Cong Okays Bill To Release Epstein Files; Big Defeat For Trump?





Donald Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr, stepped into the debate over the impending release of Jeffrey Epstein files, claiming that newly public emails show the convicted pedophile had no love for his father.Posting on X, Jr said: “It’s clear from all the emails that Jeffrey Epstein hated Trump… so much so that he literally was literally live texting Democrats on how to impeach him. If he had anything on Trump he would have used it! But, why was a convicted pedophile still in direct coms with dems???”His comments come as Congress moved to force the public release of all unclassified records relating to Epstein and his right-hand woman Ghislaine Maxwell . The House passed the bill in a 427-1 vote, with only Republican Clay Higgins opposing it. The Senate approved the measure after a unanimous consent agreement cleared the way.The legislation now heads to President Donald Trump’s desk. Despite days of denying it, he has said he will sign it. A senior White House official said the president plans to review the bill as soon as it arrives. Once signed, the Justice Department will have 30 days to release the documents, with redactions to protect victims.Trump had resisted the push for disclosure for months calling it a ""hoax"" but abruptly changed course on Sunday, urging his MAGA base and Republicans to support the bill. Even after backing it, he has complained about the continued focus on Epstein, calling it a trivial matter pushed by Democrats to overshadow his administration.","Donald Trump's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr, claims newly public emails show the convicted pedophile had no love for his father.

What does ‘CR7 × 45/47’ really mean

A viral moment — and some conspiracy theories





The White House lit up social media after posting a video of President Donald Trump walking and laughing with football legend Cristiano Ronaldo, captioned “Two GOATs” — a nod to both men’s iconic status in their respective fields. The light-hearted clip, captured during Ronaldo’s rare appearance in Washington for a black-tie state dinner honouring Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, instantly set the internet ablaze.Ronaldo’s presence added an unexpected burst of star power to an event centred on strengthening US–Saudi ties. Before the dinner, Trump told guests it was an “honour” to host the Portuguese striker, praising his role in Saudi Arabia’s modernisation push and noting that his son Barron was “a big fan of Ronaldo”.The White House later followed up with a 13-second corridor video showing Trump and Ronaldo sharing a jovial moment as they walked side-by-side. The post carried the caption “Two GOATs” (greatest of all time), along with ‘CR7 × 45/47’.The caption sparked immediate buzz not just for pairing two global icons, but for the layered numerical symbolism packed into a single line — a shorthand that merges sporting legend with political branding in a way tailor-made for the internet age.CR7 is more than just a nickname; it is Cristiano Ronaldo’s global identity and one of the most recognisable athlete brands on the planet. The “CR” stands for his initials, while the “7” refers to the shirt number that has defined his career at Manchester United, Real Madrid, Juventus, Al Nassr and the Portugal national team. Over the years, CR7 has evolved into a full-fledged commercial empire — spanning fashion, fragrance lines, hotels, gyms and sponsorships. For millions of fans, “CR7” symbolises peak athleticism, longevity, discipline and global superstar status. It’s not merely a number; it’s an international trademark.45/47, meanwhile, has become a defining political signature for Donald Trump, encapsulating his rare return to the Oval Office. He first served as the 45th president of the United States, left office, and later made a historic comeback by winning the presidency again as the 47th. The shorthand “45/47” has since become a rallying badge for his supporters — a concise symbol of his comeback story, his sustained grip on Republican politics and the belief in his political dominance. For Trump’s base, the pairing of those two numbers represents resilience, a return to power and a unique place in American presidential history.Within minutes of posting, the internet erupted with memes, edits, praise, mockery, AI deepfakes and even accusations that the video was fabricated. One commentator claimed the clip was AI-generated, but the footage aligns with confirmed reports of Ronaldo’s presence at the state dinner and matches other verified images from the night.In fact, Trump has long used high-profile celebrity interactions to craft an image of a dynamic, culturally in-touch administration — and Ronaldo’s visit offered the perfect moment to reinforce that narrative.","The White House posted a video of Donald Trump and Cristiano Ronaldo walking side-by-side.

On Cam: Trump’s ‘AGGRESSIVE’ Embrace Returns With MBS, 'Slap' On Knee Goes Viral | Watch





President Trump wheeled in Elon Musk. Prince Salman summoned Cristiano Ronaldo. The celebrity optics at the White House dinner on Tuesday night was eclipsed though by the US President formally designating Saudi Arabia as a Major non-Nato Ally (MNNA) after the Saudi prince committed to a nearly $ 1 trillion investment in America as the two leaders consecrated personal ties into greater strategic alignment.Although 20 countries – including Pakistan, Kenya, Tunisia, and Brazil – have the MNNA status, Saudi Arabia’s designation marks a transformational US reset in the region, bringing Riyadh on par with Israel in terms of unlocking a suite of military and economic privileges. Speaking at a black-tie dinner honoring the Crown Prince, Trump described the move as a leap forward in military cooperation, facilitating the sale of cutting edge US arms like the F-35, and collaboration in areas ranging from civil nuclear technology to critical minerals to artificial intelligence.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Open AI President Greg Brockman were among those who attended the East Room dinner. Also on the tech- and finance-heavy 140-people invitee list: Apple CEO Tim Cook, IBM CEO Arvind Krishna, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, Dell CEO Michael Dell, Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser, Pershing Square Capital Management’s Bill Ackman, and Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman.Although a White House fact sheet cast the MNNA designation and the agreements that accompanied it as an “America First” strategy that would will U.S coffers and galvanize the economy, a raft of deals, including a sweeping Strategic Defense Agreement, also rehabilitated a country long viewed with suspicion in Washington for the role of its nationals in the 9/11 attack on the U.S and its medieval outlook, both of which its crown prince has sought to overcome.The fact sheet also noted that the defense agreement secures new burden-sharing funds from Saudi Arabia to offset America’s costs, while making it easier for US defense firms to operate inside the kingdom.Wearing the traditional Arab dishdasha (robe) and ghutra/egal (headscarf with cord), and joking that betters who wagered he’d wear a black suit would lose money, Salman responded to Trump’s repeatedly touchy-feely outreach that broke the royal protocol that the prince is not to be touched, pledging a trillion dollar investment that Trump lapped up even though the money will be spread over several yearsWhile skeptics questioned the numbers given that Saudi Arabia’s GDP itself is just $ 1.1 trillion, MAGA partisans pointed to the riches of the Saudi’s Public Investment Fund (PIF), one of the largest Sovereign Wealth Funds in the world with more than $ 1 trillion in assets under management. Still the $ 1 trillion commitment, up from $ 600 billion announced a few months ago, is expected to crimp other Saudi pledges across the world, including in India, where the Saudi PIF recently bumped up its commitment from $ 10 billion to $100 billion.Lolly aside, the US-Saudi clinch is bound to cause geopolitical reverberations far beyond the middle-east going up to India and China which have both invested in ties with the Gulf monarchies in recent years. The Gulf region has been a key theatre for China’s Belt and Road ambitions, and Washington wrapping its arms around Riyadh and Islamabad represents a partial dilution of Beijing’s influence, as the Saudis and their vassal state lean more heavily into the US defense ecosystem.","The US President formally designated Saudi Arabia as a Major non-Nato Ally (MNNA) after the Saudi prince committed to a nearly $ 1 trillion investment in America.

US President Donald Trump used a White House state dinner to reveal that his son Barron had finally met his football hero, Cristiano Ronaldo , and that Barron is a big fan of the Portuguese superstar.The moment took place during a black-tie event held to honour Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, with Ronaldo seated among some of the most influential names in global business and sport.Ronaldo, popularly known as CR7, plays for Saudi side Al Nassr. He attended the dinner in Washington along with his fiancée Georgina Rodriguez. The 40-year-old was seen dressed in a black tuxedo and later posed for selfies with Elon Musk, Fifa president Gianni Infantino and several other high-profile attendees. It was his first public appearance in the United States since facing a rape allegation in 2017, which he has always denied.Trump mentioned Ronaldo’s presence early in his remarks. “My son is a big fan of Ronaldo. Barron got to meet him and I think he respects his father a little bit more now, just the fact that I introduced you,” he said, thanking the football star for attending. Reports have previously suggested Barron once trained in the youth system of MLS club DC United and follows the sport closely, according to the Daily Mail.Ronaldo’s appearance in Washington also revived interest in his long-running legal dispute.Kathryn Mayorga accused him of raping her in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009, a claim he has consistently rejected. US prosecutors declined to pursue charges in 2019, and a civil case was dismissed in 2022 after a judge ruled that the accuser’s lawyer had relied on stolen documents.The visit comes as Ronaldo continues to position himself as a global ambassador for Saudi Arabia’s sporting ambitions. He has referred to bin Salman as “our boss” and recently praised the kingdom’s future plans, including a bid for the 2034 World Cup.","Donald Trump shared a heartfelt moment with his son Barron.

A judiciary under reconstruction



Munir’s expanding power base



(With inputs from agencies)





Pakistan’s judiciary is in a moment of crisis as senior judges resign amid a contentious constitutional amendment reshapes the balance of power in favour of the military. Behind the crisis is the contentious 27th Constitutional Amendment, a sweeping package pushed through parliament within days. Lawyers, judges and opposition parties argue that it has weakened the courts and elevated the military’s top commander to a position with no modern parallel.Since then, Pakistan’s judiciary has been hit by a series of high-profile resignations. On Saturday, Lahore High Court judge Shams Mehmood Mirza stepped down, and his family said his decision was directly linked to the 27th Amendment. His departure followed those of Supreme Court justices Mansoor Ali Shah and Athar Minallah, who issued sharply worded letters condemning the amendment as a direct attack on judicial independence.The creation of a new Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) lies at the heart of judicial restructuring. The FCC now holds exclusive jurisdiction over constitutional matters, stripping the Supreme Court of its original powers. Pending petitions have already been shifted to the new court. President Zardari swore in Justice Aminuddin Khan as its first chief justice; six other judges were appointed, including serving Supreme Court and high court judges, though one judge reportedly refused to join.The FCC’s establishment has sparked intense concern. Critics say the president’s new power to transfer judges risks becoming a tool to sideline dissenting voices. Opposition groups argue this will fundamentally weaken judicial independence and concentrate constitutional authority in the executive and military leadership.Government ministers, however, hailed the package as “historic” and a step toward greater efficiency and national unity. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said the amendment proved that “solidarity” prevailed during a time of national strain.With judges resigning, courts being reconfigured, and the military gaining unprecedented constitutional control, Pakistan faces a moment of reckoning.The amendment passed with overwhelming numbers in both houses has dramatically restructured Pakistan’s defence architecture, elevating army chief Asim Munir to Chief of Defence Forces with command over all three military branches. His five-year tenure now resets from the date of notification, enabling him to remain in office until 2030.The Senate has since rushed through four related bills, including amendments to the Army, Air Force and Navy Acts, along with changes to Supreme Court practice rules. These laws remove the earlier equality among service chiefs and replace references to the Joint Chiefs of Staff system with a new “National Strategic Command”, further centralising military authority under Munir.Dawn reported that appointments, extensions, and tenures under these reforms “shall not be called into question before any court on any ground whatsoever”.Experts quoted in multiple reports warn that the shift risks internal military tensions and further erodes civilian oversight. Lawyer Osama Malik described the reforms as something “usually granted in absolute monarchies”, arguing they grant lifetime protections not only to Munir but also to President Zardari.Opposition lawmakers responded with uproar, shredding copies of the bill and walking out. PTI leaders labelled the move “deeply undemocratic” and “the final nail in the coffin of an independent judiciary”. Critics say these changes could reshape the political landscape, particularly for nearly 200 cases involving former prime minister Imran Khan.","Pakistan's judiciary is in a moment of crisis as senior judges resign amid a contentious constitutional amendment.

What next







Pakistan’s National Assembly on Wednesday passed the 27th constitutional amendment bill, granting sweeping powers to the military in general and country’s army chief Asim Munir in specific, and restructuring the judiciary.The vote, held amid a ruckus in the lower house, saw 234 lawmakers in favour and only four against, speaker Ayaz Sadiq announced. The session was attended by top political leaders, including Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, PML-N President Nawaz Sharif, and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari.The amendment comes at a time of heightened political tension in Pakistan, with the ruling coalition seeking to consolidate control over key defence and judicial institutions. The legislation follows earlier Senate approval, where it received 64 votes in favour and no opposition, as the opposition benches boycotted proceedings.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif hailed the passage as a demonstration of national unity, saying the house exhibited solidarity. He also condemned a recent terrorist incident in Wana, drawing parallels to the Army Public School massacre, and praised law enforcement for securing the safety of students and cadets.The amendment elevates Pakistan army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir to the newly created role of Chief of Defence Forces, giving him constitutional authority over all three branches: army, navy, and air force. Honorary five-star ranks such as field marshal, marshal of the air force, and admiral of the fleet remain lifetime titles. According to the country's law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, the reform “aims to bring constitutional oversight to defence appointments while preserving military honour and tradition.The bill also establishes a federal constitutional court (FCC) to handle constitutional and provincial matters, leaving the Supreme Court to focus on civil and criminal cases. The FCC will have equal representation from all provinces and the power to take suo motu notices on constitutional petitions. The Judicial Commission will oversee judge transfers; refusal of a transfer will be treated as retirement.The ruling coalition, including PML-N, PPP, MQM-P, and allies, backed the amendment. Opposition lawmakers condemned it as unconstitutional. PTI chairman Gohar Ali Khan called it the “Baku Amendments” and accused the government of undermining democracy. Mehmood Khan Achakzai of PkMAP protested by tearing a copy of the bill in the house.The amendment now returns to the Senate for final approval before becoming law. Analysts say the 27th amendment significantly strengthens Munir’s role in Pakistan’s military hierarchy while altering judicial oversight, marking a shift in Pakistan’s institutional framework.(With input from agencies, Dawn)","The amendment elevates Pakistan army chief Asim Munir to the newly created role of Chief of Defence Forces.

Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Powers Set To Grow As Shehbaz Govt Mulls 27th Constitution Amendment

Why it matters

The big picture

The Field Marshal’s expanding power evokes a hybrid of Pakistan’s two most dominant military rulers:

Ayub Khan, who introduced centralized presidential control and laid the foundations for military-led governance.

Zia-ul-Haq, who used the Army and Islamization to seize power, marginalize the judiciary, and suppress civilian opposition.

Munir is consolidating power not through martial law, but via constitutional amendments passed by a pliant parliament.

If Zia’s coup was loud and brutal against a strong popular leadership, Munir’s is silent, yet possibly more far reaching, being done through a political front office that’s pliant and dependent on the Army for authority. With Imran Khan in prison, any opposition will come from the streets and the troubled insurgencies to the west of Islamabad.

Pranab Dhal Samanta in the Economic Times

Zoom in

The transformation follows the India-Pakistan conflict in May 2025, a four-day exchange of air and missile strikes after the Pahalgam terror attack.

India’s Operation Sindoor targeted Pakistani airbases, radars, and command centers.

Pakistan requested a ceasefire after intense damage - a request reportedly initiated by Pakistan’s DGMO.

Donald Trump, who claimed to have brokered the truce(India has repeatedly denied the US President's claims), was effusively thanked by Munir and PM Shehbaz Sharif. Trump now calls Munir his “favorite field marshal.”

The Financial Times described their dynamic as a “bromance,” with Trump showcased on billboards across Pakistan alongside Munir and Sharif.

This international validation was followed by Munir’s promotion to Field Marshal, the second such promotion in Pakistan’s history - and the first codified under the Constitution.

Between the lines

This isn’t just about military command - it’s about rewriting the DNA of the Pakistani state.

The amendment creates a new Federal Constitutional Court, potentially diluting the powers of the Supreme Court and creating ambiguity about the hierarchy of judicial authority.

President Zardari is also granted lifelong immunity in the amendment, mirroring the legal shield given to Munir.

This dual protection signals a strategic alliance between the military and top civilian figures to institutionalize mutual insulation from accountability.

“Too much has been left to ad hoc and arbitrary decisions,” Mazari warned.

The domestic question: Can repression deliver reform?

The three-front storm: Taliban, TTP, and India

“If you nurture snakes in your backyard, they will bite you,” said Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, the Pakistani military’s official spokesman, referencing the Taliban. What a comeuppance : The remark could just as well apply to all Pakistan-grown terror groups and the TTP, whose resurgence is a grim case of blowback.

The bottom line





In Pakistan, where generals have often ruled with impunity and influence, Field Marshal Asim Munir is scripting a new playbook-quiet, precise, and constitutionally sealed. His rise is not just another chapter in the country’s well-worn saga of military dominance. It is, as one senior opposition leader put it, “a rewrite of the entire power manual.”Pakistan’s controversial 27th Constitutional Amendment proposes to recast the country’s military command structure by abolishing the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC) and creating the role of Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) - a position that will be held by the Army Chief, currently Field Marshal Asim Munir •The amendment vests unprecedented legal and constitutional power in the CDF, giving Munir operational and institutional control over the army, navy, and air force, as well as the country’s nuclear command.•It also grants five-star officers life-long rank, privileges, and immunity, a move seen as creating a parallel unelected authority beyond the reach of civilian or judicial oversight.“This amendment appears tailored to benefit a specific individual rather than to strengthen the defence structure,” Lt Gen Asif Yasin Malik, former defence secretary, told Dawn.The CJCSC post - created after the 1971 war to ensure coordination among services - will be dissolved on November 27, 2025, when the current chairman, Gen Sahir Shamshad Mirza, retires.The 27th Amendment represents the largest shift in Pakistan’s civil-military balance since the Zia era, codifying the military’s supremacy in a way that future civilian governments may struggle to reverse.•The military will no longer merely influence governance from behind the scenes - it will be constitutionally entrenched at the center of executive authority.•Strategic nuclear assets, previously overseen by the National Command Authority, will now fall under the commander of national strategic command, appointed by the PM on the army chief’s advice, and selected from within the army.“All nuclear weapons and delivery systems will be under army control, including second-strike missiles traditionally under the Navy,” warned Dr Shireen Mazari, former human rights minister, a Dawn report said.•The change grants the army a monopoly over promotions, transfers, and postings across the services, threatening morale and inter-service harmony.“If promotions in the Air Force and Navy are determined by an army-origin CDF, it could lead to festering resentments,” Mazari cautioned.At home, Munir is both omnipresent and embattled. According to a Financial Times report, his supporters compare him to Mohammed bin Salman or South Korea’s General Park - ruthless modernisers willing to bulldoze institutions in the name of reform. His critics, however, see echoes of Zia-ul-Haq’s theocratic militarism cloaked in constitutional legitimacy.The judiciary is already split, thanks to a proposed constitutional court that would dilute the Supreme Court’s power. Journalists are censored, civil rights groups are muzzled, and political opponents - most notably former Prime Minister Imran Khan - are jailed or silenced.And yet, Munir has cast himself as the architect of reform. In his speech at the Pakistan Military Academy, he spoke of “treasures hidden beneath our land” and claimed that Pakistan had begun to “regain its rightful place in the comity of nations.”But the economy tells another story. As per the FT report, Pakistan’s investment rate is the lowest in South Asia, its poverty rate has risen to 25%, and its youth unemployment is dangerously high. The country remains dependent on IMF bailouts and Gulf financing that has yet to materialise in promised volumes.While Munir consolidates power at home, Pakistan finds itself encircled by a resurgent triangle of threats - each historically rooted, each dangerously revived. In the west, the Afghan Taliban’s return to power in 2021 has proved more liability than leverage. Once covertly supported by Pakistan’s security establishment, the Taliban now resist Islamabad’s demands and turn a blind eye to cross-border attacks on Pakistani soil.More ominously, the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), an offshoot long declared outlawed, has regrouped in Afghanistan and resumed attacks in Pakistan’s tribal belt and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. This year alone, militant violence has killed over 1,400 people - the highest toll in a decade.“The military simply lacks political support on the ground there,” Iftikhar Firdous, founder of The Khorasan Diary, told FT. “The crackdown has alienated entire communities.”Simultaneously, Pakistan’s eastern border with India remains fragile after the four-day air conflict in May.Add to that domestic insurgencies in Balochistan and the Pashtun belt, and Pakistan now faces not one, but three overlapping security fronts. Instead of acting as a force-multiplier, the military’s expanding political and economic footprint is beginning to stretch its operational capacity thin.The 27th Amendment enshrines military supremacy in Pakistan's Constitution under the guise of reform and modernization.•It moves the country further away from parliamentary democracy, and deeper into military-led constitutional authoritarianism.•As Field Marshal Asim Munir prepares to become the first Chief of Defence Forces, Pakistan’s most consequential question remains: Can a military man fix a failing nation - or will history repeat itself?(With inputs from agencies)","Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Powers Set To Grow As Shehbaz Govt Mulls 27th Constitution Amendment.

ISLAMABAD: A suicide bomber killed 12 people outside a court in Islamabad on Tuesday in a sharp escalation of militant violence that the defence minister said had pushed the country into a ""state of war"".Pakistani govt ministers accused neighbouring Afghanistan of complicity in the bloodshed - an accusation Kabul denied - and vowed retaliation if Afghan authorities failed to rein in the militants Islamabad says were responsible. ""We are in a state of war,"" said defence minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif after the attack, the first strike on civilians in Islamabad in a decade. ""Bringing this war to Islamabad is a message from Kabul, to which Pakistan has the full power to respond. ""The bombing outside an Islamabad court also wounded 27 people interior minister Mohsin Naqvi said. The court bomber blew himself up near the entrance at around lunchtime.

Naqvi said the bomber had tried to enter the court building on foot but, unable to find a way in, detonated the device outside, close to a police vehicle.Several of the wounded were in critical condition, a hospital source said.No group claimed responsibility for Tuesday's attack. The main Pakistani militant group, Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), denied involvement in the attacks.

""We are totally clear that Afghanistan has to stop them. In case of a failure, we have no option but to take care of those terrorists who are attacking our country,"" Naqvi said, speaking at the scene of the court bombing. The Taliban administration spokesperson in Kabul did not respond to a request for comment on Pakistan's accusations.The court attack happened hours after militants stormed a school near the Afghan border on Monday. The attack on the school in Wana, in the north west, began Monday, when a suicide vehicle rammed the main entrance, killing three people, Naqvi said. Militants then entered the school, which is run by the military but educates civilians.By Tuesday evening, three militants were still inside the compound, security officials said, with rescue operations under way for the students trapped in another part of the school.

Asif warns of national threat, blames Kabul



Attack outside court complex



Surge in militant violence and worsening ties with Afghanistan







Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif said the country was “in a state of war” after a suicide bomber struck outside the Islamabad district courts on Tuesday, killing at least 12 people and injuring 27.The blast one of the deadliest to hit the capital in recent years has intensified tensions with Afghanistan, with Asif accusing the Taliban government in Kabul of allowing militants to operate freely.In a post on X, Asif said: “Anyone who thinks that the Pakistan army is fighting this war in the Afghan-Pakistan border region and the remote areas of Balochistan should take today’s suicide attack at the Islamabad district courts as a wake-up call: This is a war for all of Pakistan.”He wrote that Pakistan’s military was making “daily sacrifices while providing citizens with a sense of protection and security”, but warned that hoping for negotiations with Kabul would be a “mistake”. Asif insisted that Afghanistan “has the ability to prevent terrorist attacks inside Pakistan” and that bringing the conflict to the capital was “a message from Kabul”.He added that Pakistan “has the strength to respond fully”, saying the attack had erased any remaining doubts about the threat posed by militants operating from Afghan soil.The explosion took place around midday in Islamabad’s G-11 district, just outside the judicial complex where hundreds of lawyers and visitors were present. Police said the attacker tried to enter the court premises but failed, eventually detonating explosives next to a police vehicle, igniting cars and sending a fireball through the street.Interior minister Mohsin Naqvi confirmed that 12 people were killed and 27 wounded. He said authorities had recovered a severed head believed to be that of the attacker, and CCTV footage captured him moments before the blast. Witnesses described scenes of chaos, with people screaming for help as ambulances rushed to the site.The blast comes amid a sharp rise in militant violence across Pakistan. Security officials say the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) has carried out hundreds of attacks this year, mostly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa near the Afghan border, but strikes in major cities have been rare. Islamabad was last hit by a suicide attack three years ago.On Monday night, militants also attempted to storm an army-run college in Wana, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Security forces killed two attackers quickly, while others were cornered inside an administrative building. Students and staff were evacuated, and the military said the assault resembled the TTP’s 2014 massacre in Peshawar that killed 154 people.Pakistan says the Afghan Taliban have allowed TTP fighters to take refuge across the border.

Deadlock Deepens: Afghanistan Calls Pakistan Irresponsible As Peace Talks Break Down Once Again





ISLAMABAD: Pakistan said on Sunday that it was committed to dialogue to resolve differences with the Afghan Taliban but demanded that Kabul must address concerns regarding the use of its territory by terrorists.Foreign Office (FO) spokesperson Tahir Andrabi issued a statement on different media queries regarding the third round of talks with the Afghan Taliban regime in Istanbul on November 6, which concluded a day later. Turkiye and Qatar mediated the parleys.The peace talks ended without any agreement to tackle the thorny issues of cross-border terrorism , the top officials had said on Saturday.""Pakistan remains committed to the resolution of bilateral differences through dialogue. However, Pakistan's core concern, i.e. terrorism emanating from Afghanistan, needs to be addressed first and foremost,"" the FO said in a statement.It also said that Pakistan's Armed Forces and its people were well determined to eliminate the menace of terrorism from its soil and take action against its supporters, abettors and financiers.In the long statement, the spokesperson said that for the past four years, since the Taliban regime came to power in Afghanistan, there has been a sharp surge in terrorist attacks emanating from Afghan soil.""Throughout these years, Pakistan, despite suffering military and civilian casualties, exercised maximum restraint and did not retaliate,"" it said.Pakistan's expectation was that the Taliban regime would be able to control these attacks and take concrete actions against the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan/Fitna al Khawarij (TTP/FaK) elements present on Afghan soil, the FO said.The Pakistan government last year notified the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) as ""Fitna al-Khawarij"", a reference to a group in earlier Islamic history which was involved in violence.Pakistan also tried to positively engage with Afghanistan by offering bilateral trade concessions and humanitarian assistance, and the intention to constructively engage with Afghanistan so as to enable it to become a stable, peaceful and prosperous country that is at peace within and with its neighbours, the statement said.However, despite all these positive gestures, ""the response from the Taliban regime has only been hollow promises and inaction,"" it added.Instead of acting upon the core expectation to stop Afghan territory from being used for attacks against Pakistan, the Taliban regime has always tried to shy away from taking concrete and verifiable actions, it said.""Instead, it has tried to confuse the main issue with other relatively irrelevant and hypothetical issues. By confusing the main issue of terrorism, it keeps trying to develop a narrative which absolves the Taliban regime of its commitments and responsibilities towards the international community and its own people,"" it added.The statement said that Pakistan's October 2025 response to the consistent attacks emanating from Afghanistan was a manifestation of the will and determination that it will not leave any stone unturned to safeguard its territory and its people.The statement added that the Taliban regime was only interested in prolonging the temporary ceasefire, but without taking concrete and verifiable actions against the TTP/FaK terrorists.Pakistan also accused the Afghan Taliban of using the issue of Pakistani terrorists hiding in Afghanistan as a humanitarian issue, adding that they had fled in 2015 to avoid a military operation and fought together with the Afghan Taliban against Nato troops.""These terrorists and their families are now being harboured by the Taliban regime as a payback for their allegiance to the Afghan Taliban,"" it said, and added that the same terrorists established training camps in Afghanistan to launch terrorist activities in Pakistan.The FO rejected the Kabul excuse of lack of control over TTP and demanded definite and concrete actions. Pakistan also rejected the portrayal of TTP as refugees and asked Kabul to hand them over to Pakistan.It said Pakistan has never eschewed dialogue with any Government in Kabul, but it would not hold dialogue with any terrorist group.",Pakistan says it is committed to dialogue to resolve differences with the Afghan Taliban.

Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Powers Set To Grow As Shehbaz Govt Mulls 27th Constitution Amendment

What does it mean?



Opposition backlash and protests



Divided legal opinions



Support for reforms







Pakistan’s government has introduced a major constitutional change that has sparked widespread debate and protests across the country. The proposed 27th constitutional amendment, which will be voted on in Parliament next week, seeks to restructure the military’s chain of command and overhaul the judiciary, prompting strong criticism from the Opposition.The current move mirrors the era of General Zia-ul-Haq, Pakistan’s longest-serving de facto head of state, who introduced sweeping constitutional changes to entrench military control under a civilian façade. The proposed 27th Amendment, risks reviving that legacy by placing the armed forces once again at the centre of Pakistan’s political structure.The bill, tabled in the Senate on Saturday after cabinet approval, proposes to abolish the post of chairman joint chiefs of staff committee (CJCSC) and replace it with a new and more powerful position -- chief of defence forces (CDF).According to reports in Dawn, the post will be held by the serving chief of army staff, who will also become the constitutional head of the army, navy and air force. This change would make General Asim Munir the most powerful military officer in Pakistan’s history, formalising his recent promotion to Field Marshal.The amendment also includes plans to set up a new federal constitutional court (FCC) and change how high court judges are appointed.It seeks to transfer some powers from the Supreme Court to the new court, while also granting the president lifelong immunity from criminal prosecution.Pakistan law minister Azam Nazir Tarar presented the bill in the senate, where chairman Yusuf Raza Gilani referred it to a committee led by Farooq Naek for review. Naek said the goal was to “create consensus among members” before the bill comes up for voting on Monday. The government is confident of securing a two-thirds majority in both the senate and the national assembly.Opposition parties have strongly opposed the amendment, calling it a direct threat to Pakistan’s Constitution. A coalition of opposition groups, the Tehreek-e-Tahafuz Ayeen-e-Pakistan (TTAP), which includes Imran Khan’s PTI, Majlis Wahdat-e-Muslimeen (MWM), Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP), Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) and the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) has announced nationwide protests starting Sunday.“Democratic institutions have been paralysed within Pakistan… the nation must step up against the [proposed] 27th Amendment,” MWM chief Allama Raja Nasir Abbas said.PkMAP leader Mahmood Khan Achakzai said the protests would begin with the slogan: “Long live democracy, down with dictatorship.” He warned, “The opposition alliance had no choice but to launch a protest movement following the government’s move, which is shaking the foundations of the Constitution.”Legal experts are split on the amendment’s impact. Critics say it would reduce the powers of the Supreme Court, making it “irrelevant,” and tighten executive control over the judiciary.One senior counsel told Dawn, “Left with a limited jurisdiction of deciding ordinary civil, criminal and statutory appeals, the Supreme Court has now become all the more a ‘Supreme District Court’.”Former additional attorney general Tariq Mehmood Khokhar warned that the changes would “empower [the new] Federal Constitutional Court by disempowering the Supreme Court.” He said the amendment also gives the Chief of the Defence Forces constitutional authority for life, formally recognising the Field Marshal rank.Another lawyer pointed out that under the new Article 175A, the chief justice of the FCC would outrank the chief justice of the Supreme Court of Pakistan and serve until the age of 68 -- three years longer than the current limit of 65.Some legal experts, however, have welcomed the changes. Senior counsel Hafiz Ahsaan Ahmad Khokhar called the 27th Amendment “a major and long-awaited structural shift” in Pakistan’s justice system.He said the plan to have two separate apex courts -- one for appeals (Supreme Court) and one for constitutional cases (FCC) -- would bring “greater clarity, efficiency and constitutional coherence.”He also argued that the reforms could reduce political influence in the judiciary, cut down case backlogs, and modernise the justice system.Khokhar added that the new defence structure under Article 243 was in line with “modern constitutional democracies,” ensuring that the armed forces would operate under a single advisory framework accountable to the prime minister, defence minister and National Security Committee.Newly elected Supreme Court Bar Association in Pakistan, President Haroonur Rasheed also supported the creation of a Federal Constitutional Court, saying it could help streamline the judicial process.","Proposed 27th constitutional amendment will be voted on in Parliament next week.

Blast Hits Jaffar Express in Pakistan, Several Injured

A train under siege



The months that followed saw a stream of attacks:

In October, a blast on the Sindh section of the railway line derailed five bogies and injured several passengers.

In September, an explosion on the track in Mastung derailed six coaches, leaving 12 injured.

In August, six coaches derailed after an improvised explosive device went off in Mastung, while days earlier a pilot engine came under gunfire.

In July and June, two separate blasts in Sindh derailed multiple coaches.

Late last year, a suicide bomber at Quetta Station killed at least 26 people.

One battle after another

Pakistan Railways has halted all operations of the Jaffar Express between Quetta and Peshawar for four days beginning Sunday, citing “serious security concerns” in Balochistan, news agency PTI reported.The temporary suspension — enforced from 9 to 12 November — follows multiple insurgent attacks on the train over the past year, including a dramatic hijacking in March that left 26 people dead.Railway officials said the move came after fresh intelligence warnings of possible attacks targeting tracks, railway assets and civilian passengers. “The precautionary measure is based on advice from security and intelligence agencies to ensure the safety of passengers, railway staff, civilians and critical rail assets,” a senior official said, as quoted by PTI.The Jaffar Express is one of Pakistan’s busiest long-distance routes, carrying thousands of passengers daily at a cost far lower than road travel. Local commuters have criticised the shutdown, saying it leaves people in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with few affordable transport options.Over the past 12 months, the Jaffar Express has become a repeated target for insurgent groups, particularly the banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA).In March, BLA militants hijacked the train with 380 passengers on board, triggering a two-day standoff in a mountainous tunnel. Twenty-six people were killed before security forces rescued more than 350 passengers. Authorities said 33 militants also died in the rescue operation.Security officials say insurgent groups are increasingly targeting railways to cripple movement and signal the state’s inability to secure critical transport arteries. Analysts note that the frequency of attacks shows “a collapse of basic security control” across parts of Balochistan’s rail corridor.Political leaders in the province argue that Islamabad has ignored decades of local grievances. Balochistan National Party chief Akhtar Mengal recently warned that the state has “lost control” of the region, saying: “There is not a single inch of Balochistan left where the government can claim authority.”The suspension comes as Pakistan faces one of its most dangerous security challenges in years. Not only has the BLA intensified operations across Balochistan, but attacks linked to Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Islamic State Khorasan (ISK) and cross-border militants have surged.According to the latest Global Terrorism Index, Pakistan recorded a 45% jump in terrorism-related deaths this year. Security officials warn the country is now battling “four fronts at once”—an insurgent network straddling provincial, sectarian and cross-border lines.Diplomatic efforts have yielded little. Peace talks this week between Pakistan and Afghanistan in Istanbul collapsed without agreement, with both sides blaming each other for breakdowns in the ceasefire. Pakistan accuses Kabul of sheltering TTP fighters; the Taliban dismisses the allegations.","Pakistan Railways has halted all operations of the Jaffar Express between Quetta and Peshawar for four days beginning Sunday.

Pakistan’s government has moved ahead with one of the most sweeping structural changes to the country’s constitutional and military setup in decades. The proposed 27th Constitutional Amendment, tabled in the Senate on Saturday after approval by the federal cabinet, rewrites the chain of command of the armed forces and places Field Marshall Asim Munir higher than any military officer before him.The bill restructures Article 243 of the Constitution and creates a powerful new post: Chief of Defence Forces (CDF). According to Dawn, the position will be held by the serving Chief of Army Staff, who will simultaneously become the constitutionally recognised head of Pakistan’s Army, Navy and Air Force. The development formalises General Munir’s elevation as Pakistan’s Field Marshal — a title that the government has already awarded but is now seeking to permanently embed into the Constitution.The changes have ignited intense debate in Islamabad, dividing political parties, lawyers and civil society. Supporters argue that the bill modernises command structures, while critics see it as a dramatic centralisation of military power that weakens civilian oversight.As per report from Dawn, the bill abolishes the position of Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC), the top coordinating office among Pakistan’s military services, from 27 November, when the tenure of the current CJCSC General Sahir Shamshad Mirza ends.Law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar told Parliament that no new appointment will be made, because the Army Chief will take over the role’s functions as Chief of Defence Forces.Under the amendment, the President will appoint the Army, Naval and Air Chiefs on the Prime Minister’s advice, while the CDF will be constitutionally empowered to command all three services.A new position Commander of the National Strategic Command will oversee Pakistan’s nuclear and strategic arsenal. Dawn reported that the commander must be an officer from the Army, appointed by the Prime Minister on the recommendation of the CDF. This further cements the Army Chief’s control over nuclear command authority.The bill also grants unprecedented rights to officers who attain five-star ranks such as Field Marshal, Marshal of the Air Force, or Admiral of the Fleet.Law minister Tarar clarified that Parliament not the Pakistan Prime Minister will have the power to cancel such titles.The amendment does not stop at the military. The second half of the proposal restructures Pakistan’s judicial system.According to Geo News, the bill establishes a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC): a powerful new judicial body that would:Legal experts quoted by Dawn warned that the changes could “dethrone” the Supreme Court as Pakistan’s top judicial authority. One senior counsel said the Supreme Court risked being turned into a “Supreme District Court”, dealing mostly with ordinary appeals, while constitutional matters shift to the FCC.Former additional attorney general Tariq Mehmood Khokhar argued that the amendment tightens executive control over the judiciary and “empowers the FCC by disempowering the Supreme Court”.However, other senior lawyers called it a “forward-looking reform”. They say separating constitutional and appellate functions would reduce delays, depoliticise the Supreme Court and bring Pakistan closer to judicial models in other democracies.The bill has triggered fierce debate in Islamabad. The timing — months after Munir’s elevation and amid delicate coalition negotiations — has intensified public scrutiny.Dawn reported that the proposal surfaced after PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari revealed that PML-N leaders, including Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, requested PPP support for constitutional reforms.Government allies insist the reform merely formalises existing military structures and honours national heroes. Critics say it permanently rebalances power in favour of the Army.If adopted, the 27th Constitutional Amendment will be one of Pakistan’s most consequential defence reforms since the 1980s, dissolving one of the military’s oldest offices, raising the Army Chief to unprecedented constitutional supremacy, and reshaping Pakistan’s highest courts.","Pakistan's government has moved ahead with one of the most sweeping structural changes to the country’s constitutional and military setup in decades.

Deadlock Deepens: Afghanistan Calls Pakistan Irresponsible As Peace Talks Break Down Once Again

(With ANI inputs)





NEW DELHI: A day after peace talks between Afghanistan and Pakistan in Turkey broke down, the Taliban on Saturday accused “elements within the Pakistani military” of pursuing “anti-Afghanistan policies for years. ”“Unfortunately, certain military elements in Pakistan appear to view a stable and strong Afghanistan as contrary to their interests,” Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said in a statement on X. “They have long exploited Afghanistan’s instability, conflicts, and displacement, and now seem intent on creating tensions through fabricated pretexts.”Mujahid also rejected claims that the rise of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) was linked to the Taliban’s return to power in Kabul. “Some groups have falsely accused the Islamic Emirate, suggesting that instability in Pakistan and the TTP’s growth began with our arrival. In reality, both date back to 2002, a result of misguided policies by certain Pakistani military elements who aligned with the US, permitted drone strikes in Waziristan, and turned against their own people,” he wrote.He pointed to a series of Pakistani military campaigns against the TTP — including Operations Al-Mizan, Rah-e-Rast, Sher Dil, Nijat, Koh-e-Safid, and Zarb-e-Azb — that, he said, displaced hundreds of thousands of civilians.“In this so-called war on terror, 80,000–90,000 soldiers and civilians were killed, by Islamabad’s own count, long before the Islamic Emirate’s rise,” Mujahid added.Calling Pakistan’s instability “an internal issue,” Mujahid remarked the Taliban has taken steps to prevent cross-border militancy since taking power. These include mediating dialogue among political and religious figures, relocating refugees from the Durand Line, banning weapons among refugee populations, and issuing fatwas against unauthorized foreign jihad.“The Islamic Emirate welcomes all efforts that allow refugees to return safely,” he stated, reaffirming that Afghanistan would not allow its territory to be used to interfere in another country’s affairs.","The Taliban accused “elements within the Pakistani military’ of pursuing “anti- Afghanistan policies for years” “They have long exploited Afghanistan’s instability, conflicts, and displacement, and now seem intent on creating tensions through fabricated pretexts,” Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125186693,imgsize-78016,width-400,resizemode-4/taliban-accuses-pakistani-military-of-fueling-instability-through-quotmanufactured-pretextsquot.jpg"

Will it make Pak army chief Asim Munir's position stronger?



Proposed change to Article 243 Description Why it increases Munir’s power Formal recognition of Field Marshal Field Marshal to be constitutionally recognized as a rank, not just an honorary title Grants Munir secure legal status, enabling tenure extension and legal protection against dismissal or demotion Creation of 'Commander of Defence Forces' (CDF) Establishes a new central position to oversee army, navy, air force Munir may transition to/head this role, consolidating command over all forces, superseding the current setup Shift of supreme command away from president to CDF Reduces President and PM’s operational control over armed forces Centralizes authority in Munir (as CDF or Field Marshal), further reducing civilian oversight Tenure extension via new constitutional language Secures longer term (potentially unlimited) for Munir in his new post Provides Munir greater continuity and leverage in national affairs Centralization of civilian government functions Ministries like education, population welfare moved under federal control Increases central government (and de facto military) power, indirectly empowering Munir Reduction of provincial autonomy Provincial share in federal resources reduced, central government gains more control Weakens provincial challenge to federal/military authority, strengthening Munir’s policy reach

Why Pakistani critics are skeptical?







Taking ""lessons"" from tensions with India, Pakistan has moved to fortify the constitutional basis of military command, signaling a push to modernize defense structures and tighten civilian-military coherence. Its law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, on Saturday, tabled the 27th Constitutional Amendment Bill in the upper house, a move aimed at revising Article 243 to formally enshrine the appointments and parallel ranks of the Army, Air, and Naval chiefs.Citing “lessons” from recent India-Pakistan standoffs, Tarar said the nature of modern warfare had changed, requiring constitutional alignment with evolving command realities.“Recent Pakistan-India tensions have taught us many lessons. The nature and strategy of war have completely changed. Appointment procedures and some positions were previously in the Army Act but were not mentioned in the 1973 Constitution. Parallel ranks exist worldwide for Air Chief and Naval Chief,” Tarar said.The move, however, has come under scanner as many believe it could give more power to military than the civilian government in Pakistan.India, on May 7, launched Operation Sindoor against terror sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, killing over 100 terrorists and targeting key JeM and LeT camps. The move, which came in retaliation to Pahalgam terror attack, turned into a major India-Pakistan issue with the latter also launching a military operation against India.By May 10, the two nations announced a ceasefire after Pakistan approached India for truce talks.Ten days after the truce, Pakistani army general Asim Munir was promoted to the rank of field marshal, the principal military advisor to the prime minister and the president of Pakistan on all matters related to national security. Before Munir, former Pakistan President Genral Ayub Khan had self elevated himself to field marshal in 1959.The proposed changes to Article 243 in Pakistan's Constitution, are designed to significantly bolster the authority of the military, specifically, army chief and recently designated field marshal Asim Munir. Here's how:According to an article by Pakistani media outlet Dawn, legal experts in Pakistan remain divided on whether such institutional adjustments truly warrant a constitutional amendment, noting that most operational reforms can be achieved through ordinary legislation rather than altering Article 243.Constitutional experts argued that modernising command structures or creating a Chief of Defence Staff-type position does not require amending Article 243. Such reforms could be introduced through ordinary legislation or defence rules. Altering the Constitution, they warned, risks expanding military autonomy under the guise of structural integration.Another confusion surrounding Article 243 stems from the changes introduced by the 26th Amendment, which extended the army chief’s tenure from three to five years. The current chief, appointed under the old law and later elevated to the ceremonial rank of field marshal, a position not mentioned in the Constitution, has become the focal point of legal ambiguity.Dawn reported that experts remain divided on whether his term automatically extends under the new law or requires a fresh notification, raising questions about the real intent behind the proposed 27th Amendment: to resolve this technical uncertainty or to further cement the military’s influence within Pakistan’s constitutional framework.","Pakistan's law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, on Saturday, tabled the 27th Constitutional Amendment Bill in the upper house.

Another crisis brewing? Pakistan on brink of food supply collapse as flour shortage deepens; prices hit the roof,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/another-crisis-brewing-pakistan-on-brink-of-food-supply-collapse-as-flour-shortage-deepens-prices-hit-the-roof/articleshow/125183013.cms,"Pakistan Cries Foul At UNSC As India Holds Indus Waters Treaty In Abeyance Over Pahalgam Attack

Prices surge, tandoors punished

Trade paralysis and a deepening food crisis

Water shortage adds to worries – dams running dry





(With inputs from agencies)





Pakistan’s twin cities are staring at a worsening flour emergency after the Punjab food department halted wheat supplies to mills in Rawalpindi and Islamabad, triggering panic across markets and raising questions over the country’s fragile food security. The sudden suspension has deepened an already tense economic climate, with transport blockades, water shortages and declining dam levels all feeding fears of another nationwide crisis.Dealers say all existing orders for flour, wheat and fine flour were cancelled from Friday night, leaving shops and tandoor owners without stock, PTI reported citing the The Express Tribune.The Rawalpindi Flour Mills Association, which held an emergency meeting to address the crisis, warned that “production will remain paralysed” unless wheat permits are restored immediately. The association described the ban as “ill-considered” and cautioned that shortages could spiral into a humanitarian emergency in the federal capital and adjoining regions.Flour inflation has shot up at record pace, prompting anger from bakers and retailers. According to the Pakistan Naanbai Association, the price of a 79-kilogram sack of red flour has doubled to PKR 11,000 since the Shehbaz Sharif–Maryam Nawaz government took office.Fine flour, used widely for bread and bakery items, has risen from PKR 6,200 to PKR 12,600.The association’s president, Shafiq Qureshi, accused authorities of “state oppression”, claiming that dozens of tandoors have been demolished and nearly a hundred sealed for selling roti at higher prices in line with rising flour rates. Many owners have been fined between PKR 25,000 and PKR 50,000. “Instead of fixing the wheat supply, they are taking out their frustration on us,” Qureshi said, warning that families are being pushed to breaking point as bread becomes increasingly unaffordable.While wheat supply chokes Punjab’s food chain, Pakistan’s transport routes are already gridlocked due to deteriorating relations with Afghanistan. Thousands of trucks carrying food items, pharmaceuticals and export consignments for Afghanistan and Central Asia have been stranded at ports and highways.Senior Vice Chairman of the Goods Transport Association Imdad Hussain Naqvi said drivers are stuck without food, water or security. “This is not just a loss for transporters; it's a loss for the entire state,” he said, as quoted by PTI. He further warned that perishable goods are rotting on highways and thousands of workers are on the brink of starvation.The current wheat crisis comes months after India regulated flows from the Chenab following the Pahalgam terror attack. The move had contributed to a sharp drop in water levels at the country’s two key dams, Mangla and Tarbela.Pakistan is among six countries with the highest levels of inefficient agricultural water use, worsening freshwater losses amid arid conditions, according to the World Bank’s first global water monitoring report, Continental Drying: A Threat to Our Common Future.The study highlights that inefficient irrigation in drying regions—particularly in Pakistan, Algeria, Cambodia, Mexico, Thailand, Tunisia, and Romania—drives massive water waste, with more than two-thirds linked to water-intensive crops.","Flour inflation has shot up at record pace, prompting anger from bakers and retailers.

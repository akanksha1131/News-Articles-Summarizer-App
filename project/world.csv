On the night of 6 November 2025, sky-watchers will be treated to one of the most striking celestial events of the year. The November supermoon, often called the Beaver Moon, will be the closest full moon of 2025, appearing noticeably larger and brighter than any other moon this year. This extraordinary alignment occurs when the full moon coincides with its perigee, the point in its orbit nearest to Earth, making it appear up to 14% bigger and 30% brighter. Visible to the naked eye without any special equipment, the supermoon offers a rare spectacle for astronomy enthusiasts, photographers, and casual observers alike, creating a breathtaking opportunity to appreciate the moon’s full splendour under clear night skies.A supermoon is not just any full moon. It occurs when the moon reaches its perigee, the closest point in its elliptical orbit around Earth, at the same time it is full. Because the moon’s orbit is slightly oval-shaped rather than perfectly circular, its distance from Earth fluctuates throughout the month.When the perigee coincides with a full moon, the lunar surface appears larger and brighter than usual. NASA estimates that the moon can look up to 14% bigger and 30% brighter than the faintest full moon of the year.This difference, while subtle to the casual observer, can produce a striking and almost tangible effect in the night sky.The term “supermoon” was first coined in 1979 by astrologer Richard Nolle and has since entered popular vocabulary as a way to describe this visually enhanced lunar event.The November supermoon will officially reach its full phase on 6 November at 1:20 PM GMT (2:20 PM CET). While it can be observed on the evenings immediately before and after, the optimal viewing window is shortly after sunset on 6 November, when the moon rises above the horizon.In 2025, this will be the second of three supermoons, and it will also be the closest of the year, with the moon approaching within just under 222,000 miles (357,000 kilometres) of Earth. Its brightness and proximity make this particular supermoon an exceptional sight, worthy of both casual observation and photographic documentation.Viewing the supermoon is simple. No telescopes or binoculars are required – just clear skies and an unobstructed horizon. However, while the moon will appear slightly larger, the difference in size is often subtle. Shannon Schmoll, director of Abrams Planetarium at Michigan State University, explains that the change is “most obvious as a comparison between other images or observations.”For photography enthusiasts, the supermoon provides excellent opportunities. A telephoto lens can capture the moon’s surface details, while including foreground elements like buildings, trees, or water can create a sense of scale and drama. Time-lapse photography is also ideal to show the moon rising and slowly moving across the sky.Because the moon will be closer than usual, its gravitational pull on Earth’s oceans will be slightly stronger, causing marginally higher tides. Astronomer Lawrence Wasserman of Lowell Observatory notes, however, that this effect is generally subtle and unlikely to have significant impact on most coastal areas. November’s full moon is traditionally called the Beaver Moon, a name derived from the time when beavers prepare lodges for winter. Historically, full moons have been important markers for seasonal and agricultural cycles, often holding cultural and symbolic significance.In 2025, the Beaver Moon stands out as the brightest and closest supermoon of the year, making it especially noteworthy. Its visual impact, combined with its historical and cultural resonance, ensures that it will be remembered as a highlight of the year’s celestial events.If you miss the November supermoon, there is still one more chance in 2025. The final supermoon of the year will occur on 6 December, offering another opportunity to observe the moon at its closest and most luminous. Each supermoon provides a unique chance to connect with the cosmos and witness the subtle rhythms of our solar system in action.To make the most of this celestial event, consider the following:Witnessing a supermoon is more than a visual spectacle; it’s a reminder of Earth’s relationship with its natural satellite. On 6 November 2025, the Beaver Moon will rise closer and brighter than it has all year, offering a magical moment to pause, look up, and marvel at the universe.","The November supermoon, often called the Beaver Moon, will be the closest full moon of 2025, appearing noticeably larger and brighter than any other moon this year.

North Korea says its longtime ceremonial head of state Kim Yong Nam has died,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/north-korea-says-its-longtime-ceremonial-head-of-state-kim-yong-nam-has-died/articleshow/125072710.cms,"Kim Yong Nam, head of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly of North Korea (Image credits: AP)





SEOUL: Kim Yong Nam, a quintessential North Korean bureaucrat whose lifelong loyalty to the ruling Kim dynasty allowed him to serve as the country's ceremonial head of state for two decades, has died, state media reported on Tuesday.The Korean Central News Agency said Kim Yong Nam, former president of the Presidium of North Korea 's rubber-stamp Supreme People's Assembly, died on Monday of multiple organ failure at the age of 97.KCNA said that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un visited the bier of Kim Yong Nam to express deep condolences over his death. It said Kim Yong Nam's funeral was set for Thursday.Kim Yong Nam was not related to Kim Jong Un, the third generation of his family to rule North Korea. Kim Jong Un, grandson of state founder Kim Il Sung, took power upon his father Kim Jong Il's death in 2011 in the country's second hereditary power transfer.Kim Yong Nam served as head of the Supreme People's Assembly from 1998 to April 2019. That post is North Korea's nominal head of state, though the true power was held by the Kim family that has ruled the North since its formal foundation in 1948.Kim Yong Nam, who was known for propaganda-filled speeches with a deep, booming voice at key state events, often appeared in state media greeting visiting foreign dignitaries on behalf of Kim Jong Un and his late father Kim Jong Il.In February 2018, he travelled to South Korea with Kim Jong Un's influential sister, Kim Yo Jong , to attend the opening ceremony of the Pyeongchang Olympics as Pyongyang sought better ties with Seoul and Washington after years of heightened animosities on the Korean Peninsula.The trip made Kim Yong Nam the highest-level North Korean official to visit South Korea since Kim Jong Un sent a top military officer to attend the closing ceremony of the 2014 Asian Games in Incheon.At the Pyeongchang opening ceremony, Kim Yong Nam and Kim Yo Jong sat within feet of then-US vice-president Mike Pence, though the two sides made no apparent contact.North Korea's temporary diplomatic openness peaked with the summits between Kim Jong Un and President Donald Trump in 2018 and 2019, but Kim Yong Nam did not attend them and his influence was seen as waning due to his age.In April 2019, he was replaced by Choe Ryong Hae, one of Kim Jong Un's close confidants who previously served as the top political officer of the North's 1.2 million-member military.Kim Yong Nam's career epitomised that of a successful North Korean bureaucrat. He joined the ruling Workers' Party shortly after the 1950-53 Korean War and survived major political purges through the 1970s. He was appointed to the powerful Politburo in 1978 and served 15 years as foreign minister, starting in 1983. During his tenure, the Berlin Wall fell and the Soviet Union disintegrated, leaving North Korea isolated.North Korea watchers also say Kim Yong Nam had an expertise in third-world diplomacy. He was a frequent participant in gatherings of nations that consider themselves independent from major power blocs, including the 2012 Non-Aligned Movement (Nam) summit in Iran.People who met Kim Yong Nam described him as mild-mannered but staunch in his opinions.""I found Kim Yong Nam a puzzling figure. In greetings before business began, he was cordial and relaxed, but once at work, he relentlessly followed his script in a way that reminded of former Soviet foreign minister Andrei Gromyko,"" former Washington Post reporter Don Oberdofer wrote in his book, ""The Two Koreas"".In a testament to his loyalty to the ruling dynasty, Kim Yong Nam read an elegy to Kim Il Sung when he died in 1994. He also undertook the job of formally nominating Kim Jong Il to be chairman of the national defence commission after the son observed a three-year mourning period.A native of Pyongyang, Kim Yong Nam studied at the Kim Il Sung University and the Moscow State University.","Kim Yong Nam served as head of the Supreme People's Assembly from 1998 to April 2019.

Control of Tesla is at stake in vote on Elon Musk's pay plan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/control-of-tesla-is-at-stake-in-vote-on-elon-musks-pay-plan/articleshow/125072569.cms,"A Tesla dealership in Las Vegas, March 29, 2025.





Tesla's shareholders will decide this week whether the automaker should award its CEO, Elon Musk, stock worth almost $1 trillion if he achieves a series of impossible-sounding goals.But there are big questions about how tough those goals really are.Musk would acquire voting control over nearly 29% of Tesla shares if he met all of the targets in a 10-year performance plan. Among other things, the company would have to deploy 1 million humanlike robots and boost its stock market value to $8.5 trillion from $1.4 trillion today.That sounds difficult. But the plan would also allow Tesla's board of directors to grant Musk a portion of the shares even if he fell short. Some corporate governance experts said the board, which includes Musk's brother and several long-standing friends and business associates, could award him shares regardless of his performance.""These are not independent decision-makers,"" said Dorothy Lund, a professor at Columbia Law School who teaches and writes about corporate governance.She cited a Delaware court decision that struck down a previous pay plan for Musk in part because the judge found that many Tesla directors were too close to him personally or owed their wealth to him.Tesla has criticized that decision as violating the will of Tesla shareholders, who approved the earlier plan by large margins twice. The Delaware Supreme Court is expected to rule soon on the company's appeal.Tesla's board is ""very active, very independent, and I think the outside world doesn't appreciate it,"" Robyn Denholm, the board's chair, said in a September interview with The New York Times.Supporters of Musk said the board should have some leeway in awarding shares because markets and technology could change. They also contend that they don't believe that he would be given shares he had not truly earned.""I don't see that as a big concern,"" said Andrew Rocco, a stock strategist at Zacks Investment Research. ""As controversial as Musk is, he sets big goals, and in time he attains these goals and surpasses them.""Denholm said there were no escape clauses for a key part of the plan that would require Musk to raise Tesla's stock price by 500%. ""Market capitalization -- the market's verdict on real value -- can't be 'gamed' through aggressive pricing or other tactics to create illusory growth,"" she said in a letter to shareholders.Tesla, Musk and their critics have been waging contentious campaigns before the company's annual meeting on Thursday. The fight has distinct echoes of the hostility that characterizes American politics. Musk's right-wing politics appear to be at play, too, with state pension managers in states governed by Democrats, like California and New York, opposing the pay plan and those in Republican-run states, like Florida, supporting it.Even Pope Leo XIV has weighed in, citing Musk's pay as an example of the gap between rich and poor. ""If that is the only thing that has value anymore, then we're in big trouble,"" he told Crux, a Roman Catholic news site, this summer.Musk and his critics are agreed on one thing -- this is a fight over how much influence he has over Tesla. Musk has said he is more interested in greater voting control than in money. After taxes, his stake would be around 25%. While that is well short of a majority, in practice it would be very difficult to pass measures he opposed.""I don't think it's an overstatement to say that it would revive the era of robber barons who wielded near-absolute control,"" Brad Lander, the New York City comptroller, said during a conference call organized by SOC Investment Group, an organization associated with labor unions that opposes Musk's compensation plan.Tesla's board sees the plan as a way to motivate him as he transforms the company from primarily selling electric cars to making robots and self-driving taxis.The board points to Musk's achievements. Tesla is the only profitable U.S. electric carmaker. His admirers in and out of the company see him as the only person who can deliver products that usher in ""sustainable abundance.""But Tesla's robots and self-driving cars may not generate significant revenue, let alone profits, for years. Skeptics say some of his promises, including that Tesla robots could care for children or perform surgery, are far-fetched.Musk told investors and analysts in October that he needed to have strong influence over the ""robot army"" that Tesla would build. His supporters interpreted that as a desire to prevent control from falling into the wrong hands.""Control of Tesla could affect the future of civilization,"" Musk said on X, his social media platform.Visions of futuristic products are central to Tesla's lofty stock-market valuation, said John Paul MacDuffie, a professor of management at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania who focuses on transportation. Wall Street values Tesla at more than four times the value of Toyota Motor, the world's largest car company by sales.""Musk has persuaded some investors that everyone is going to be in a robotaxi,"" MacDuffie said. ""I don't buy it.""For Musk to collect the whole package, which is broken into 12 parts, Tesla would have to achieve milestones like selling 10 million subscriptions to self-driving software and increasing earnings before depreciation and other items to $400 billion from $17 billon last year.""He doesn't get any compensation if he doesn't deliver,"" Denholm said during the Times interview at Tesla's California offices.She said Musk required enormous compensation because he was driven to do things ""that no one else has done before, doing things that further humankind.""But the board could give him some of the shares if it determined that he had missed a product target because of natural disasters, war, interference by government regulators or other, unspecified circumstances.It would be possible ""for Mr. Musk to earn at least the first three tranches of the award without meeting a single operational milestone,"" according to a report by Glass Lewis, a firm that advises investors on shareholder votes. Each tranche includes stock worth tens of billions of dollars.Glass Lewis and ISS Stoxx, another advisory firm, recently recommended that investors reject the pay package. During a conference call last month, Musk accused the firms of ""corporate terrorism.""Tesla said in a letter to shareholders that the firms' opinions were flawed. ""Their analysis cannot distinguish between innovation and risk, or between ambition and mismanagement,"" the company said.ISS declined to comment on Musk's remark. Glass Lewis said in a statement that it offered ""informed analysis and recommendations to our clients worldwide.""Tesla's board has created a website to promote the pay plan and has run video ads on social media. Musk has posted about the shareholder vote more than 60 times in recent months.The intensity of the campaign reflects the board's eagerness to win the vote by a wide margin to mute criticism, said Ann Lipton, a professor of corporate governance at the University of Colorado School of Law.Many analysts expect the plan to pass because Musk is allowed to vote his own shares in Texas, where the company moved its incorporation after losing the Delaware case on his earlier pay package. He controls about 15% of the total. But if the new pay package secures fewer than half of shares owned by outside investors, it could hurt Tesla's reputation, Lipton said during the SOC conference call.""The mythology of Elon Musk kind of depends on the perception that he has the continuing devotion of Tesla shareholders,"" she said.Tesla's board said in a statement that the intensity of its campaign ""is being driven by the significance of this election to the future of Tesla"" and the need to reach smaller investors who collectively own a lot of the company's stock.Investors will vote on other important measures, including an investor's proposal that calls for Tesla to invest in xAI, Musk's privately held artificial intelligence company. The board has taken no position on that measure, but Musk favors it.Shareholders will also vote on a proposal by Thomas DiNapoli, the New York state comptroller, to eliminate a restriction on shareholder lawsuits. After moving its corporate domicile to Texas, Tesla took advantage of a state law allowing it to ban suits by shareholders who own less than 3% of the company. Only a few investment funds meet that threshold.Tesla's board maintains that the restriction protects the company from suits by people who don't represent the views of a significant number of shareholders.Investors can still band together to clear that threshold, the board said in a regulatory filing. DiNapoli, who oversees a pension fund that owns about $1.5 billion in Tesla stock, said that was impractical and wants any shareholder to be able to sue.Denholm warned shareholders in a letter last week that if they rejected the pay plan, Musk might quit. ""We run the risk that he gives up his executive position, and Tesla may lose his time, talent and vision.""To Musk's supporters, threatening to walk is a normal way to negotiate. But Randall Peterson, a professor at London Business School who studies corporate boards, said the dependence on a single executive was a red flag.""The graveyards are filled with indispensable men,"" Peterson said.","Tesla shareholders will decide this week whether the automaker should award its CEO, Elon Musk, stock. Musk would acquire voting control over nearly 29% of Tesla shares if he met all of the targets. Among other things, the company would have to deploy 1 million humanlike robots and boost its stock market value to $8.5 trillion.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125072628,imgsize-656220,width-400,resizemode-4/qwfg-29.jpg"

Is Russia behind this decision?

What is Tomahawk missiles?

Will not giving missiles to Ukraine weaken its fight against Russia?





US President Donald Trump said on Sunday aboard Air Force One that, for now, he was not considering a deal to allow Ukraine to obtain long-range Tomahawk missiles for use against Russia.Trump was cool to a plan for the United States to sell Tomahawks to NATO nations that would transfer them to Ukraine, saying he did not want to escalate the war. His latest comments to reporters indicated he remained reluctant.“No, not really,” Trump told reporters as he flew to Washington from Palm Beach, Florida, when asked whether he was considering a deal to sell the missiles. He added, however, that he could change his mind.He and Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte had discussed the Tomahawk idea when they met at the White House on October 22.Rutte said on Friday that the issue was under review and that it was up to the United States to decide.Earlier, Russia had raised the issue of Washington supplying Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine and warned that such military support could harm US–Russia relations and adversely affect any peace process.The US President later told journalists at the White House that he had spoken to Putin about Tomahawk missiles. “I did actually say to him, ‘Would you mind if I gave a couple of thousands of Tomahawks to your opposition?’ I did say that to him,” Trump told reporters, adding that Putin did not appear to like that idea.“What do you think he’s [Putin’s] going to say, ‘Please sell Tomahawks?’ No, he doesn’t want Tomahawks to be supplied to Ukraine,” he added.According to US defence information, Tomahawk missiles were developed in the 1970s. They are long-range cruise missiles launched from ships or submarines and are generally used for long-distance attacks. The Pentagon’s budget documents state that the missile can make “deep-strike” attacks on land and “uses a combination of inertial navigation, GPS, and terrain contour matching (TERCOM) or Digital Scene Matching Area Correlation (DSMAC) for precision guidance”.Tomahawks fly at supersonic speed at low altitudes – about 30 metres off the ground – and have a range of more than 1,250–2,500 km. They usually carry conventional warheads but can also carry nuclear ones.The US, United Kingdom, Netherlands and Australia have all used these missiles in combat.So far, the US has launched more than 2,300 Tomahawks from its ships and submarines during operations in Syria and Libya, among others.Possibly yes. The missiles’ long-range precision would allow Kyiv to strike Russia’s critical energy infrastructure, a key pillar of Moscow’s war economy, according to CSIS.A sustained campaign targeting oil and gas facilities could weaken Russia’s ability to fund and supply its war, potentially forcing it to negotiate.However, analysts caution that a handful of missiles won’t shift the balance — hundreds would be needed for meaningful impact. Even then, success would depend on consistent, focused strikes and the indirect effects trickling through Russia’s economy and public pressure.","US President Donald Trump said on Sunday he was not considering a deal to allow Ukraine to obtain long-range Tomahawk missiles for use against Russia. Trump was cool to a plan for the United States to sell Tomahawks to NATO nations that would transfer them to Ukraine, saying he did not want to escalate the war.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125045122,imgsize-22322,width-400,resizemode-4/putin-trump-and-zelenskyy.jpg"

Kash Patel’s Jet Scandal Erupts; $60M FBI Plane For Girlfriend’s Show? FBI Chief Slams Critics





FBI director Kash Patel put out a statement amid the new allegations against him that he went to attend his girlfriend's performance in Pennsylvania on a $60 million FBI jet. FBI directors are not allowed to travel on any commercial plane and are supposed to use FBI jet for their personal use too paying reimbursement for that. But a former FBI agent Kyle Seraphin sensationalized this as he brought this to the notice of the people on his podcast as he said: “We’re in the middle of a government shutdown where they’re not even gonna pay all of the employees that work for the agency that this guy is jetting off to hang out with his girlfriend in Nashville on our dime?""FBI clarified that Patel always pays reimbursement in advance and his personal use is limited as he's always on FBI duty .But the FBI director made it a point to send across a message to ""supposed allies"" who are staying silent when he and his partner are under ""baseless"" attack.""Let me be clear: we will not be distracted by baseless rumors or the noise from uninformed internet anarchists and the fake news. I’ve always said — criticize me all you want. But going after the people doing great work, my personal life, or those around me is a total disgrace,"" Patel said.""The disgustingly baseless attacks against Alexis — a true patriot and the woman I’m proud to call my partner in life — are beyond pathetic. She is a rock-solid conservative and a country music sensation who has done more for this nation than most will in ten lifetimes. I’m so blessed she’s in my life.""""Attacking her isn’t just wrong — it’s cowardly and jeopardizes our safety. My love of family will always be my cornerstone, and you will never tear that down or keep me from them. I and this FBI will stay laser-focused on our mission and continue the reform we promised — rebuilding this Bureau from the ground up. And to our supposed allies staying silent — your silence is louder than the clickbait haters,"" Patel said.This is not the first time that Alexis has been the target. She was touted as an Israeli agent who pressured Patel not to disclose the Epstein Files because of Epstein's supposed link with Israel. The whole conspiracy theory fell flat as Wilkins sued Kyle Seraphin for calling her a former Mossad agent and sought at least $5 million in damages.",FBI director Kash Patel went to attend his girlfriend's performance in Pennsylvania on a $60 million FBI jet.

‘I won’t be extorted’: Trump refuses to negotiate over govt shutdown







US President Donald Trump appeared on CBS’s 60 Minutes in his first interview with the network since settling a lawsuit with CBS News earlier this year.Trump had famously walked out of a 60 Minutes interview with Lesley Stahl before the 2020 election, accusing the show of bias. Trump later sued the company over the newsmagazine’s interview with Kamala Harris, and Paramount reportedly paid $16 million to settle the case this summeIn his latest appearance, Trump defended his administration’s handling of key foreign and domestic challenges, from nuclear tensions and Middle East diplomacy to immigration, healthcare, and the ongoing government shutdown.The sit-down, recorded Friday at his Mar-a-Lago residence with journalist Norah O’Donnell, aired Sunday night.President Trump alleged that both Russia and China have been secretly testing nuclear weapons underground. “Russia’s testing, and China’s testing, but they don’t talk about it,” he said. Asked why he recently ordered the United States to conduct its own nuclear tests, Trump explained, “You don’t necessarily know where they’re testing. They test way underground where people don’t know exactly what’s happening with the test. ”“Well, we have more nuclear weapons than any other country. Russia's second. China's a very distant third, but they'll be even in five years. You know, they're makin' 'em rapidly, and I think we should do something about denuclearization, which is gonna be some-- and I did actually discuss that with both President Putin and President Xi. Denuclearization's a very big thing. We have enough nuclear weapons to blow up the world 150 times.Russia has a lot of nuclear weapons, and China will have a lot,” he siad.Speaking about Iran, Trump said that his administration had “blasted the hell out of them” to prevent Tehran from becoming a nuclear power. “You could’ve never had any kind of a deal if you had a nuclear Iran. And you essentially had a nuclear Iran,” he said.He described meeting the pilots who carried out the strike and inviting them to the White House. “They told me something I didn’t know. They said, ‘Sir, for 22 years we’ve been practising this route … and you were the only president that let us do our job.’”Trump praised them as “real American heroes,” adding, “When you can hit at midnight with no moon, with no vision, every single air shaft, where that bomb went deep into that mountain and exploded … they deserve to come to the White House.”During the interview, Trump acknowledged the precarious balance in South Asia, noting that the United States continues to monitor India and Pakistan closely. Although he avoided direct mention of current military developments, administration officials have said Washington remains wary of escalation in the region, especially given the ongoing nuclear concerns.Trump once again claimed he helped prevent a potential nuclear conflict between India and Pakistan. “I think we're gonna get it done, yeah. I think he really wants to do business with the US,” Trump said, adding, “If it wasn't for tariffs and trade I wouldn't have been able to make the deals... They were going to war. They were gonna have a nuclear war with Pakistan.”Trump cited comments by Pakistan’s prime minister, saying, “If Donald Trump didn't get involved, many millions of people would be dead right now.”In May, India launched Operation Sindoor, carrying out precision strikes on terrorist camps located across Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir in response to the Pahalgam terror attack, which had killed 26 civilians the previous month.India has firmly denied any US involvement, reiterating that de-escalation was achieved solely through direct military communication between the two nations.Trump repeatedly attacked former President Barack Obama’s legacy, linking him to what he called “a defective plan put into line by Barack Hussein Obama, who was a lousy president.” He even ridiculed the Obama Presidential Center project in Chicago, saying, “He’s building a museum that’s, like, four times over budget … The neighbourhood doesn’t even want ‘em.”At one point, Trump hit out at New York Mayoral race front-runner Zohran Mamdani , invoking them in the context of what he sees as elite detachment from “real American” priorities.“Communist, not Socialist. Communist. He's far--far worse than a Socialist. Oh, that's so crazy. Look. When I left New York, we were at the-- the epitome of it was a great city. It was doing great. It was a great city, but there were some bad sides, because we had a guy named de Blasio, who was the worst mayor. Like I say Biden was the worst president, de Blasio was the worst mayor in history,” the 47th POTUS said.He went on to add, “I think he's probably gonna make de Blasio look great. I think he will make de Blasio look like one of our great mayors. De Blasio was the worst mayor we've ever had. Now I saw that, you know, but I was sort of leaving during that period of time.”Trump used the platform to claim success in halting illegal immigration across the US-Mexico border. “We have a closed border right now,” he said. “For five months in a row, they have zero — think of this, zero people coming into our country through our southern border.”He accused Mexico of allowing “their prisons to be emptied into our country,” calling it one of his administration’s greatest challenges. “Millions of people a year walked into our country totally unchecked, unvetted. They were criminals, murderers, drug dealers, people from jails and mental institutions,” he said.When asked if Nicolás Maduro’s days as Venezuela’s president were numbered, Trump said, “I would say yeah. I think so, yeah.”Pressed by O’Donnell about speculation that the United States might be preparing strikes in Venezuela, Trump refused to confirm or deny it. “I’m not gonna tell you what I’m gonna do with Venezuela, if I was gonna do it or if I wasn’t going to do it,” he said, calling it a matter of national security.He pointed to the rise of violent transnational gangs such as Tren de Aragua, saying Venezuela had “been bad” in exporting criminal networks.Asked about Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s upcoming visit to the White House and his insistence that the kingdom would not join the Abraham Accords without a two-state solution, Trump replied, “No. I think he’s gonna join.”He added, “We will have a solution. I don’t know if it’s gonna be two-state. That’s gonna be up to Israel and other people, and me.”Trump argued that peace in the Middle East was only possible because his administration prevented Iran from becoming a nuclear power.The president squarely blamed Democrats for the ongoing government shutdown, now in its sixth week. “Democrats’ fault,” he said flatly, accusing them of refusing to vote for an extension that would reopen federal offices. “They don’t wanna give us an extension because they used to think it was good for them, but the polls are turning around.”He said Democrats were suffering from “Trump derangement syndrome” and insisted, “All they have to do, Norah, is say, ‘Let’s vote.’ And you can open the economy during our interview.”Healthcare dominated much of the domestic discussion. Trump said Democrats were blocking progress on reform. “We almost did it. We were one vote short. John McCain made a mistake, frankly,” he said.He repeated his long-standing criticism of the Affordable Care Act, calling it “bad healthcare at far too high a price.” “It’s too expensive for the people,” Trump said. “They’re gonna get a very big increase this year.”Democrats have pushed to extend subsidies under Obamacare to prevent premiums from doubling for millions of Americans. O’Donnell noted that “three quarters of these people that will see their healthcare premiums double live in states where you won in the last election.” Trump responded, “And I’m saying we can fix it.”Trump rejected calls to compromise with Democrats to reopen the government. “I won’t be extorted,” he said, insisting that he would not “give $1.5 trillion so that prisoners, drug dealers and people from mental institutions” could receive welfare or healthcare.He also pressed Republicans to end the Senate filibuster, telling 60 Minutes, “Republicans have to get tougher. If we end the filibuster, we can do exactly what we want.”","US President Donald Trump appeared on CBS’s 60 Minutes in his first interview with the network since settling a lawsuit with CBS News earlier this year.

Donald Trump felt ""badly"" for the UK royal family after Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, formerly known as Prince Andrew, was stripped of his titles and called the situation “tragic.

He will now move to a property on the Sandringham Estate, which will be privately funded by the King.Meanwhile, in the US, members of a congressional committee investigating the Jeffrey Epstein case have intensified their calls for Andrew Mountbatten Windsor to answer questions about his links to the late sex offender.At least four Democrat members of the House Oversight Committee renewed their calls for Andrew to testify, although the panel is controlled by Republicans, who have not indicated they would support the move.Congressman Suhas Subramanyam told the BBC: ""If he wants to clear his name, if he wants to do right by the victims, he will come forward"".Andrew could appear remotely, have a lawyer present and could speak to the panel privately, Subramanyam said. ""Frankly, Andrew's name has come up many times from the victims,"" he told Radio 4's Today programme on Saturday.""So he clearly has knowledge of what happened and we just want him to come forward and tell us what he knows.""He added: ""No matter who it is - American or not - everyone should be looked at.""Fellow committee member Raja Krishnamoorthi told BBC Newsnight he would be willing to formally summon Andrew with a subpoena, although he conceded this would be difficult to enforce while he was outside of the US.","Donald Trump said he felt ""badly"" for the UK royal family after Andrew Mountbatten Windsor was stripped of his titles.

Chinese-founded fashion and e-commerce giant Shein has announced a worldwide ban on all sex-doll products after French authorities accused it of selling dolls resembling children and warned the company could be banned from the French market.As per news agency AFP, France’s anti-fraud office, DGCCRF, said the listings on Shein’s website were “childlike” and of a likely pornographic nature.The Paris prosecutors’ office confirmed investigations had been opened against Shein, AliExpress, Temu, and Wish for distributing “messages that are violent, pornographic or improper” and accessible to minors.As per CNN, Shein removed the products immediately after France’s warning and launched an internal review, later announcing a “complete ban on all sex-doll-type products.” It also temporarily removed its adult products category for review.A company spokesperson quoted by AFP said that the ban applies globally.“These publications came from third-party vendors, but I take personal responsibility,” said Shein’s executive chairman Donald Tang, adding that “the fight against child exploitation is non-negotiable for Shein.”French finance minister Roland Lescure told BFMTV that the government could legally block Shein’s access to the market if such violations recur.“These horrible items are illegal,” he said, stressing that France would act firmly against the retailer.According to news agency AP, under French law, distributing child-pornographic material online is punishable by up to seven years in prison and a €100,000 fine.The scandal comes days before Shein’s first physical store opening in Paris’s BHV Marais department store — a move already facing backlash from activists and lawmakers.Some brands have withdrawn their products from BHV following the controversy, while France has fined Shein three times in 2025 for cookie law breaches, false advertising, misleading information, and undeclared plastic microfibres.","Shein has announced a worldwide ban on all sex-doll products after French authorities accused it of selling dolls resembling children.

California Democratic Representative Nancy Pelosi on Monday described President Donald Trump as a “vile creature” and “the worst thing on the face of the Earth” and said she would announce any decision on seeking another term in Congress after Election Day on Tuesday.The former House speaker made the remarks in an interview with CNN’s Elex Michaelson, during a discussion of Thomas Jefferson’s vision of the United States and the separation of powers among the three branches of government, in contrast with Trump’s expansive view of executive power.“Our founders did not want to have again — how can I say this? It’ll sound like I’m awful about Trump, because he’s just a vile creature, the worst thing on the face of the Earth,” she said.Asked whether she really believed that, Pelosi responded: “Yeah, I do.

US President Donald Trump on Tuesday (Indian time) warned he would restrict federal funds for New York City if Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani won the mayoral election, called the candidate a Communist, and predicted total economic disaster under his leadership.Posting on Truth Social, Trump lashed out at the NYC Democratic candidate, accusing him of having no chance to bring the city back to its former glory.“If Communist Candidate Zohran Mamdani wins the Election for Mayor of New York City, it is highly unlikely that I will be contributing federal funds, other than the very minimum as required,” Trump wrote.“As a Communist, this once great city has zero chance of success, or even survival I don’t want to send good money after bad.”Trump, who was born in Queens and often refers to New York as his first home, said it was his obligation to run the Nation and claimed the city would become a complete and total economic and social disaster if Mamdani won.He said he would even prefer a Democrat with a record of success over Mamdani, urging New Yorkers to back former governor Andrew Cuomo, whom he called capable.“Whether you personally like Andrew Cuomo or not, you really have no choice,” Trump added.“You must vote for him, and hope he does a fantastic job.”Trump also jabbed at Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa, quipping that a vote for Sliwa is a vote for Mamdani and adding that Sliwa looks much better without the beret.Trump’s post marked his most direct intervention yet in a local race that has drawn national attention amid deep ideological divides over housing, policing, and federal aid.Candidates for mayor of New York City, are racing to the finish line Nov. 4 to see who wins off-year elections that are considered a signal for how 2026 campaigns will go.The voters need to choose between Zohran Mamdani, the front-runner in polling , Andrew Cuomo, the Democratic former governor, and Curtis Sliwa, the Republican founder of the anti-crime group Guardian Angels.","US President Donald Trump on Tuesday (Indian time) warned he would restrict federal funds for New York City if Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani won the mayoral election.

Elon Musk has thrown his support behind Andrew Cuomo in New York City’s heated mayoral race and advised New Yorkers to not go for the 'socialist' Zohran Mamdani.In a post on X, the Tesla and SpaceX chief urged New Yorkers to “remember to vote tomorrow,” warning that “a vote for Curtis [Sliwa] is really a vote for Mumdumi or whatever his name is. ” He ended his post with a blunt message: “VOTE CUOMO!”The endorsement aligns Musk with several billionaire figures who have rallied against Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani, including Mike Bloomberg, Airbnb cofounder Joe Gebbia, and hedge fund manager Bill Ackman.US President Donald Trump also said he preferred Cuomo, calling him the “lesser evil” compared to Mamdani in a CBS 60 Minutes interview.

"English test crackdown bars over 7,000 truckers across US; Indian-origin drivers among most affected",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/english-test-crackdown-bars-over-7000-truckers-across-us-indian-origin-drivers-among-most-affected/articleshow/125067978.cms,"From Tragedy To Target: Indian Truckers Face Backlash in United States After Deadly Florida Crash





Harjinder Singh truck crash



Over $40 million lost



What do experts say?



Loss of jobs for immigrant drivers







Thousands of truck drivers across the United States have been barred from operating after failing newly enforced English proficiency tests, with Indian-origin and Latino drivers among those most affected.The rule, reinstated under Donald Trump’s administration, has raised alarm among trucking companies and worker groups, who say it unfairly targets immigrant drivers. It could worsen the ongoing truck driver shortage.Since June, more than 6,000 commercial truckers have been taken off the road for failing roadside English-language checks, according to a Washington Post analysis of Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) data.FreightWaves, a transport and logistics outlet, reported that at least 5,006 “English language-related out-of-service violations” were recorded through October, a number that continues to climb as states increase enforcementLast week, Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy, in a post on X, said that ""7248 drivers placed out of service for failing to meet Trump's English language proficiency standards as of October 2025.""""US department of transport requires commercial truck drivers to speak and understand English to operate a big rig- or they will be taken out of service,"" Duffy added.The stricter enforcement followed several fatal road incidents, including a crash in Florida that killed three people.The driver, Harjinder Singh, 28, originally from India, failed an English proficiency assessment after the accident, answering only two of twelve questions correctly. He has pleaded not guilty to vehicular homicide charges.The Department of Transportation announced that California would lose over $40 million in federal funding for refusing to comply with the rule.“California is the only state in the nation that refuses to ensure big rig drivers can read our road signs and communicate with law enforcement,” said Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy. The rule was reinstated in May under Trump’s executive order, which mandates that commercial drivers must demonstrate sufficient English skills to read road signs, converse with the public, and communicate with officials.While federal officials argue the policy improves safety, industry experts say there is no data linking English proficiency with accident rates. “English proficiency is such a subjective standard,” said Brandon Wiseman, president of Trucksafe Consulting. “What one officer might think is proficient, another officer down the road might think is not proficient. That makes it tough.”Drivers and trucking companies are not happy over the lack of clarity and fairness in the testing process. “It’s going to cause a lot of singling out of Mexican individuals or individuals of Hispanic heritage, and maybe stereotyping,” said Adalberto Campero, CEO of Texas-based Unimex. “Drivers are scared now. They’re threatened, they’re intimidated because they feel like their livelihood could be taken away.”Several industry schools are now preparing drivers for roadside English checks. Eli Soler, who runs a Miami-based commercial driving school, said he has added mock English tests to his classes. “This is an industry that requires both skills, the English to communicate and the proficiency to drive equipment,” he said.The enforcement has also raised fears of job losses, particularly among older or immigrant drivers. “A big chunk of the industry is made up of Latino drivers who work really hard and safely, even if their English isn’t perfect,” said David Sanchez, a Texas-based driver. “The young people are going to learn English pretty quick, but there are a lot of older drivers who are probably going to lose their job.”According to the FMCSA, about 3.8 per cent of licensed commercial drivers have limited English proficiency.Critics argue the new rule is part of a broader political agenda. The Sikh Coalition called the policy “an effort to remove approximately 194,000 non-domiciled drivers from the workforce,” saying it unfairly targets immigrants rather than addressing genuine safety concerns.Despite the backlash, Secretary Duffy defended the enforcement, saying, “Americans are a lot safer on roads alongside truckers who can understand and interpret our traffic signs.""","Since June, more than 6,000 commercial truckers have been taken off the road for failing roadside English-language checks.

The wife of Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani , Rama Duwaji, chose to skip her husband's debate, making it no surprise that she would remain absent from the entire campaign of Mamdani but it was a conscious decision to remain in the background and do her own thing when her husband does his own thing. The 28-year-old artist did not make any social media posts seeking votes for her husband, did not do any joint television appearances or agree to do any magazine profile.But she accompanied Mamdani to Comedy Central's 'The Daily Show' to sit in the crowd alongside more than 10,000 people. CNN reported that Duwaji declined interviewed during the election campaign and it's not clear whether she would have any official role if Mamdani is elected mayor.Mamdani met Duwaji on the dating app Hinge in 2021 when Mamdani was just elected to the New York State Assembly. Duwaji was not politically inclined but they discussed Mamdani's plans to run for mayor several months before their engagement in 2024.Syrian-origin Duwaji was born in Houston and lived in Texas until her family moved to Dubai when she was 9.

'What The Hell Are You Doing?': Obama Talks MAGA, Then Torches 'CLUELESS' Trump





Former First Lady Michelle Obama complained how she had to navigate 'white hot glare' as a Black First Lady as she was discussing her new book 'The Look' on ABC News. “We were all too aware that as a first black couple, we couldn’t afford any missteps. And that as a black woman, I was under a particularly white hot glare,” Michelle wrote in her book.During the interview, when she was asked particularly about her phrase 'white hot glare', Michelle Obama said, ""You can't afford to get anything wrong because you didn't get the ...at least until the country came to know us, we didn't get the grace that I think some other families have gotten.""“Making a mistake in a political environment where you’re the first and people are where your opponents are using your race as a fear-based strategy to make you seem like the other, then everything matters,” she said.The Look is co-authored by Michelle with her stylist and speaks about Michelle's fashion choices. She said she was apprehensive about discussing fashion when she was the First Lady and there were more important things at that time but now that the public knows her and her work, she feels comfortable speaking about the 'soft power'.“We live in a culture, sadly, where, you know, if somebody wants to go after a woman, the first thing they do is go after our looks, our size, our physical being, as a way to, you know, make us feel small, to keep us in place,” Michelle said.But her complaint did not go down well with social media users who pointed out that the Obamas have been the most celebrated First Family and Michelle Obama has been on the cover of Vogue thrice.""I am sad to announce that we have once again disappointed the Obamas,"" one wrote.

Influencer sparks backlash after suggesting SNAP recipients be given ‘prison loaf’ instead of food benefits,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/influencer-sparks-backlash-after-suggesting-snap-recipients-be-given-prison-loaf-instead-of-food-benefits/articleshow/125062748.cms,"The influencer’s suggestion to replace SNAP benefits with “prison loaf,” a bland disciplinary meal once served in US jails, drew nationwide outrage/ Image: File





A bland meal with a bitter debate

“The point of

EBT

is to ensure people don’t starve to death. That’s it,” Yap wrote. “Even if we agree that’s a worthwhile goal, it can be achieved with Nutraloaf.”

“Nutraloaf provides the correct incentives: you won’t starve and you’ll be motivated to earn enough money to eat real food again.”

How a prison meal became a political flashpoint

'Heartless' or 'pragmatic'? Internet is divided

“We should treat the poor like we treat misbehaving prisoners, is def a take I expect from u,”

“You’re a horrible person,”

“Being poor is not a sin that must be ‘atoned’ for by suffering, you soulless ghoul,

: “They can opt out at any time by simply paying for their own food.”

. “At any other time in history, and in much of the world today, Diane’s proposal of free nutritionally complete food would be considered extremely generous, but it’s not hot Cheeto-flavored so apparently it’s immensely cruel.”

“This is extreme but yes EBT should be strictly limited to rice, chicken, beans, veggie, lower carb pasta, pork to ensure people get the best value for the taxpayer buck.”

SNAP in crisis: millions face a hunger cliff

Hunger, dignity, and the politics of poverty





It goes by many names, nutraloaf, prison loaf, meal loaf, disciplinary loaf, confinement loaf, seg loaf, grue, or “special management meal.” Once reserved for misbehaving inmates in US prisons, the dense, beige slab of mashed protein, vegetables, and carbohydrates has suddenly become a flashpoint in America’s fight over poverty, dignity, and government aid.The catalyst was Diane Yap, founder of the Friends of Lowell Foundation, a nonprofit defending merit-based admissions at a top San Francisco high school. In a now-viral post on X, Yap argued that rather than offering food stamps through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the US government should simply distribute nutraloaf to low-income Americans.Her proposal, equal parts utilitarian and, to many, strikingly tone-deaf, instantly set social media ablaze.Nutraloaf was designed for prisons, a meal compact enough to deliver full nutrition but simple enough to serve without utensils — useful when dealing with inmates who had misused or weaponised cutlery. It resembles meatloaf but is typically blander, made from mashed vegetables, grains, and proteins.Once a routine disciplinary tool in correctional facilities across the United States and formerly in Canada, its use has long been controversial.Lawsuits have challenged its legality; in 2008, Vermont’s Supreme Court ruled against serving it as punishment, and four states, California, Massachusetts, Minnesota, and New York, have since banned its use altogether.Supporters maintain it’s nutritionally balanced and inexpensive. Critics call it dehumanising. And now, Yap’s suggestion to bring it outside prison walls has triggered fresh outrage, this time not from inmates, but from the public.Yap’s post came as more than 42 million Americans faced uncertainty over their food assistance benefits amid a prolonged government shutdown. Federal judges have ordered the Trump administration to explain how it plans to fund SNAP, also known as food stamps, after federal funding ran dry.With payments halting over the weekend, Yap wrote that many recipients “abuse the system by buying junk food or luxuries.” SNAP’s average household benefit stands at $332 per month, with families with children receiving about $574, and an average family of four receiving $715, roughly $6 per person per day.Online, Yap’s idea drew a torrent of condemnation.one user wrote.said another.” added a third.Yap respondedStill, some defended her argumentone commenter wrote.Another added:Behind the online clash lies a very real crisis. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program feeds more than 42 million Americans, including low-income families, veterans, the elderly, and people with disabilities. It was “invented as a way to help families afford meals in the face of rising food costs,” and remains one of the US’s most significant anti-hunger safety nets.SNAP operates through Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) cards, reloadable debit cards topped up monthly for purchasing food. The benefits cannot be spent on alcohol, tobacco, nonfood items, or most takeout meals.The programme costs around $8 billion a month and is federally funded through the Farm Bill but administered by individual states. For fiscal year 2024, SNAP received $100 billion, about 1.5% of total federal spending. Beyond preventing hunger, SNAP acts as an economic stabiliser, freeing up household budgets for rent, utilities, and essentials such as diapers, clothing, and medicine.This month’s government shutdown froze that funding. Federal judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island ruled that the US Department of Agriculture must use $5.25 billion (£4 billion) in emergency funds to continue partial payments. They gave the Trump administration until Monday at 12:00 EST (17:00 GMT) to report on how it intends to restore benefits.US President Donald Trump had earlier said he had directed government lawyers to seek guidance from the courts on how the administration could legally fund SNAP, adding, “Even if we get immediate guidance, it will unfortunately be delayed.”Speaking on CNN on Sunday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent echoed the president’s remarks, noting that Mr. Trump wanted the courts to clarify how funds could be lawfully reallocated to resume SNAP payments, which he said could go out as early as Wednesday.The funding crisis follows a statement from the USDA late last month, announcing that food assistance funds would not be distributed starting 1 November due to the ongoing government shutdown. “The well has run dry,” the department said at the time.In response, half the states, along with the District of Columbia, have filed lawsuits against the administration, arguing that they are legally required to keep the SNAP programme running within their jurisdictions despite the freeze.Yap’s comments struck a nerve because they blurred a delicate moral line: the difference between ensuring survival and preserving dignity. To her critics, replacing SNAP with nutraloaf reduces poverty to punishment. To her defenders, it spotlights waste in a system that, they argue, too often enables dependency.But the timing made the post especially volatile. As millions wait to see whether courts will authorise emergency food aid, the idea of feeding poor Americans “prison loaf” feels, to many, like a grim metaphor for the nation’s political paralysis.SNAP was built to prevent hunger, not to police taste or ambition. Yet the debate it has reignited reveals something deeper: a country divided not just by wealth, but by its understanding of what compassion should look like when the cupboard runs bare.","Diane Yap, founder of the Friends of Lowell Foundation, suggested replacing food stamps with 'prison loaf' The bland, beige slab of mashed protein, vegetables, and carbohydrates has suddenly become a flashpoint in America’s fight over poverty, dignity, and government aid.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125067032,imgsize-593961,width-400,resizemode-4/snap-vs-nutraloaf.jpg"

A Michigan defense lawyer has claimed that FBI director Kash Patel's statement that the FBI foiled an ISIS-style attack planned on Halloween weekend was inflated and that there was no such plan. Dearborn's Mohmed Ali and Majed Mahmoud have been charged with receiving and transferring, and attempting and conspiring to transfer, firearms and ammunition, knowing and having reasonable cause to believe that the firearms and ammunition would be used to commit a federal crime of terrorism.Ali's lawyer Amir Makled said his client in a 20-year-old US citizen with a lawful interest in recreational firearms. ""There is no evidence whatsoever of a planned terror or ‘mass casualty’ plot,” Makled said, adding that the federal authorities have not given him many details about the investigation and he concluded that there was no terror event planned. “I don’t know where this hysteria and this fearmongering came from,” Makled said.Five people were arrested in connection with the foiled terror plan bit only two have been charged in the 73-page criminal complaint. Ali and an unnamed juvenile were referenced in third-party communications from July to October of this year. The conversations stated that the ""brothers"" were planning to conduct an attack on behalf of the Islamic State terrorist group.Ali allegedly purchased a shotgun, AR-15-style rifle and other firearm accessories in August and September, the same time the third-party conversations referred to an attack, according to the complaint.Mahmoud allegedly also purchased an AR-15-style rifle in September and then bought more than 1,600 rounds of ammunition a month later, according to the complaint.One of the alleged co-conspirators had his phone reviewed by a Customs and Border Patrol agent upon his return to the U.S. in August, the complaint said. The man had Google searches for ""ISIS,"" the ""Islamic State,"" and pictures of ""military-style clothing with weapons,"" the complaint said.According to the complaint, a different co-conspirator discussed traveling to Syria to join ISIS and had tried to convince ""Athari"" and ""Bukhari"" to join them. Investigators believe those names were used to reference Ali and the unidentified juvenile.Federal agents recovered AR-15-style rifles, two shotguns, four handguns and ammunition in addition to tactical vests and GoPro cameras at Ali and Mahmoud's residence, according to the complaint. Agents also seized two tactical backpacks, chest-rig vests and 24 empty magazines at a storage unit allegedly rented by Ali.","Mohmed Ali and Majed Mahmoud have been charged with receiving and transferring, and attempting and conspiring to transfer, firearms and ammunition.

Who was invited to the party?







A video of half-naked dancers performing inside a giant martini glass at Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Halloween party stirred a row online, with netziens accusing the US president of being “tone deaf” as millions of Americans lost food aid during the ongoing government shutdown.Internet compared the scene to ""Epstein Island,” as, just like the late paedophile, the party also seemed to have similar vibes of wealth, secrecy, and moral decay. Social media compared the extravagant Mar-a-Lago bash to the kind of elite gatherings once linked to Jeffrey Epstein — lavish on the surface but unsettling in tone.One viral video showed a woman in a white bikini swirling inside a massive champagne glass, draped in a feather boa as guests cheered. Another showed a performer surrounded by glittering decorations and a massive ice sculpture chilling alcohol.California governor Gavin Newsom blasted the event, writing, “Donald Trump hosted a Great Gatsby party while Snap benefits were about to disappear for 42 million Americans. He does not give a damn about you.” Senator Chris Murphy also weighed in, saying, “The way he rubs his inhumanity in Americans’ face never ceases to stun me.He’s illegally refusing to pay food stamp benefits while he throws a ridiculously over-the-top Gatsby party for his Right-wing millionaire and corporate friends. ”The party came just hours after federal funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) officially ended, affecting millions of families who depend on food benefits. Two federal judges later ordered the Trump administration to use emergency funds to pay for the programme.The government shutdown has left around 1.4 million federal employees without pay.Among the party guests were Ivanka and Tiffany Trump, Jared Kushner, Michael Boulos, and secretary of state Marco Rubio.The party was held at Trump’s Palm Beach resort in Florida and was themed “A little party never killed nobody,” a nod to the 2013 film The Great Gatsby, based on F. Scott Fitzgerald’s novel about greed and excess.Guests were dressed in flashy 1920s outfits as champagne flowed and flapper dancers performed for the crowd.Trump brushed off backlash during a media interaction before the party, saying the situation was “so easily solved” and blaming Democrats for the shutdown. “We have tremendous support, but it’s not even support, it’s common sense. Open up the country,” he said.The backlash comes just days after Trump unveiled renovations at the White House, including turning part of the East Wing into a ballroom and replacing the Lincoln Bathroom’s historic tiles with white marble.Polls show that most Americans blame the Trump administration for the shutdown, reports the Telegraph. His approval rating has dropped to -18 per cent in the latest Economist average, lower than Joe Biden’s at the same stage of his presidency.","Internet compared the scene to ""Epstein Island,” as, just like the late paedophile, the party also seemed to have similar vibes of wealth, secrecy, and moral decay.

Pakistan Among Countries Testing Nuclear Weapons, Donald Trump Says While Announcing US Testing Plan





US President Donald Trump has claimed that Pakistan is among several countries actively testing nuclear weapons, asserting that this justifies his administration’s decision to resume America’s own nuclear testing after more than 30 years.In an interview with CBS News’ 60 Minutes on Sunday, Trump said that Russia, China, North Korea and Pakistan were all conducting tests while the United States had refrained from doing so.“Russia’s testing and China’s testing, but they don’t talk about it. We’re an open society. We’re different. We talk about it because otherwise you people are going to report. They don’t have reporters that are going to be writing about it,” he said.“We’re going to test because they test and others test. And certainly North Korea’s been testing.

We’re the only country that doesn’t test.And I don’t want to be the only country that doesn’t test,” he said.Confusion surrounded Trump’s announcement, first made on social media minutes before his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea. The last US nuclear explosion occurred in 1992.While no country other than North Korea is known to have conducted a detonation for decades, Trump maintained that “they test way underground where people don’t know exactly what’s happening.”US energy secretary Chris Wright later clarified that current discussions referred to “non-critical” system tests, not full nuclear explosions.",US President Donald Trump has claimed that Pakistan is among several countries actively testing nuclear weapons.

Pakistan Issues Naval Warning as Its War Games Overlap with India’s Military Drills





Pakistan, heavily dependent on the waters of the Indus basin, faces a acute risk of insufficient water storage after India suspended the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) earlier this year, according to the Ecological Threat Report 2025.The report, released by the Institute for Economics and Peace, a Sydney-based independent and non-profit think tank, says the suspension gives India the ability to control the westward flow of the Indus and its tributaries into Pakistan. The move came after India decided to put the treaty in abeyance as a punitive measure following the Pakistan-sponsored Pahalgam terror attack on April 22 this year.This marks a major setback for Pakistan, whose agriculture depends 80 per cent on the Indus River system. The report highlighted that Pakistan’s dams can currently hold only about 30 days of Indus flow, leaving the country highly vulnerable to disruptions.“Pakistan lacks sufficient storage to buffer variations,” the report warned, adding, “If India were truly to cut off or significantly reduce Indus flows, Pakistan’s densely populated plains would face severe water shortages, especially in winter and dry seasons.Indeed, about 80 per cent of Pakistan’s irrigated agriculture depends on Indus basin rivers.”While India’s infrastructure limits its ability to completely stop river flows, even small disruptions could have ""disastrous"" short-term effects on Pakistan’s farm sector.In May, India carried out “reservoir flushing” operations at the Salal and Baglihar dams on the Chenab River without notifying Pakistan. This process, used to remove silt by draining reservoirs, had been restricted under the treaty due to the risk of sudden downstream changes.The impact was immediate: parts of the Chenab River in Pakistan’s Punjab ran dry for several days when India shut the dam gates and later released sediment-filled torrents upon reopening them.The Indus Waters Treaty, signed in 1960 and mediated by the World Bank, has long acted as a key tool for water-sharing and conflict resolution between the two countries. It governs the use of the Indus River and its six major tributaries -- five on the left bank and one on the right.","India suspended the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) earlier this year.

‘Pak Is Infuriated With…’: MEA Slams Pakistan Over Border Tensions With Afghanistan





Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan’s (TTP) second-in-command Amjad, a key figure in the banned militant group, was killed along with three other militants when security forces foiled an infiltration attempt from Afghanistan into Pakistan, the army said on Thursday.According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), cited by PTI, the militants tried to cross the Pakistan-Afghanistan border in Bajaur district on Wednesday night when their movement was detected.“The troops effectively engaged and thwarted the militants' attempt to infiltrate,” the statement said, adding that four militants, including high-value target Amjad alias Mazahim, were “sent to hell.”Amjad, who served as deputy to TTP chief Noor Wali and headed the group’s Rehbari Shura, was among Pakistan’s most wanted militants, carrying a bounty of Rs five million. The ISPR said he was “actively involved in perpetuating numerous terrorist activities inside Pakistan while residing in Afghanistan.”The army also urged the interim Afghan government to take “concrete measures to ensure that Afghan soil is not used by militants to perpetrate terrorism against Pakistan.”Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif lauded the security forces for eliminating the TTP commander and his aides. Prime Minister Shehbaz said the security forces, through their professional expertise, eliminated the highly wanted TTP commander Amjad and thwarted “the nefarious designs of the enemies of Pakistan's sovereignty.” He added, “We will continue to defeat the elements that harm innocent people. ”The operation in Bajaur came a day after six Pakistani soldiers, including a captain, were martyred during an intelligence-based operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Kurram district, where seven terrorists were also gunned down.Formed in 2007 as an umbrella organisation of several militant outfits, the TTP seeks to impose its strict version of Islam across Pakistan. The group, believed to have close ties with al-Qaeda, has claimed responsibility for numerous deadly attacks, including the 2008 Marriott Hotel bombing in Islamabad and the 2009 assault on army headquarters.","Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan’s (TTP) second-in-command Amjad, a key figure in the banned militant group, was killed along with three other militants.

'Pakistan’s patience has run its course'



Growing tensions on the border







Pakistan has admitted to having an agreement with the United States that allows the use of drones within its territory, TOLOnews reported, citing Afghan and diplomatic sources. The acknowledgment, made during the latest round of Pakistan-Afghanistan peace talks in Turkey.According to TOLOnews, the Pakistani delegation said it “cannot break” the agreement with Washington that authorises drone operations. Afghan negotiators, in response, demanded written guarantees that Pakistan would not allow US drones to use its airspace or strike Afghan territory. Sources familiar with the talks, cited by TOLOnews said Pakistan’s delegation initially agreed to these conditions but later reversed its position after receiving instructions from Islamabad, saying it had “no control over US drones and could not ensure action against ISIS. ” Qatari and Turkish mediators were reportedly taken aback by the sudden shift in stance.The Afghan side reiterated that the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) issue was Pakistan’s own internal problem. “The Islamic Emirate has repeatedly emphasised, and again reaffirmed, that insecurity in Pakistan is a domestic matter,” TOLOnews quoted its delegation as saying, adding that Afghanistan remains committed to ensuring no group uses its soil to harm other nations.The disclosure came as four days of talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan in Istanbul collapsed without agreement. Pakistan’s information minister Attaullah Tarar said the dialogue “failed to bring about any workable solution,” blaming Kabul for refusing to act against militants responsible for cross-border attacks. “Pakistan’s patience has run its course,” Tarar said, adding that Islamabad “would continue to take all possible measures necessary to protect our people from terrorism. ”Pakistani Defence Minister Khawaja Asif issued a strong warning to the Taliban regime, vowing that Islamabad could “strike deep into Afghanistan” if further attacks occurred. “If their territory is used and they violate ours, we will retaliate — we surely will,” Asif told reporters. In a separate post on X, he cautioned Kabul against testing Pakistan’s “resolve and capabilities at its own peril and doom.”The breakdown in talks follows weeks of escalating border clashes that left dozens dead. Pakistan’s military earlier this month struck what it described as TTP hideouts inside Afghanistan, prompting retaliatory attacks that killed Pakistani soldiers. Though a ceasefire brokered by Qatar on 19 October remains technically in effect, all major crossings between the two countries remain closed, with hundreds of trucks stranded.Islamabad insists that the Afghan Taliban continues to shelter militants who launch attacks in Pakistan, a charge Kabul denies. The UN has expressed concern over the failed negotiations, urging both sides to avoid renewed fighting.","Pakistan has admitted to having an agreement with the United States that allows the use of drones within its territory, TOLOnews reported.

Escalation Fears Mount As Pakistan-Afghanistan Talks End Without Conclusion In Turkey

Operation Sindoor







Days after Jaish-e-Mohammed announced the formation of its first-ever women's wing, 'Jamaat-ul-Mominaat', the JeM's chief Masood Azhar has released a 21-minute audio message from group's Bahawalpur headquarters, Markaz Usman o Ali, outlining a detailed plan for training, indoctrinating, and deploying women under the new unit, as local media reported.According to media reports, in the audio, Azhar explains how women will be recruited, trained, and integrated into his long-term ""global jihad"" mission, mirroring the structure of JeM's long-running male training programme.Azhar declares that just as men undergo the 15-day ""Daura-e-Tarbiat"" course, women joining 'Jamaat-ul-Mominaat' will be trained through an induction course named ""Daura-e-Taskiya"", conducted at Markaz Usman o Ali in Bahawalpur.For the past two decades, JeM's ""Daura-e-Tarbiat"" has served as the primary indoctrination stage for male recruits, convincing them that jihad against India guarantees paradise. Azhar now intends to extend the same ideological training to women.In his speech, the wanted terrorist promises that any woman who joins Jamaat-ul-Mominaat “will go straight to paradise from her grave after death.”He added that women completing the first course will advance to a second stage, ""Daura-Ayat-ul-Nisah,"" which will teach how Islamic texts ""instruct women to conduct jihad.""Justifying the formation of a female brigade, most-wanted terrorist Azhar claimed, ""The enemies of Jaish have put Hindu women into the army and set up female journalists against us,"" declaring that he is ""mobilising his women to compete and fight against them.""He asserts that JeM’s male Mujahids will work alongside this new female unit, saying the women’s brigade will ""spread Islam across the world.""Azhar also announces that Jamaat-ul-Mominaat branches will be opened in every district of Pakistan , each headed by a District Muntazima responsible for recruiting local women. He lays down strict communication rules, stating, ""Women joining the brigade must not speak to any unrelated men through phone or messenger, except their husbands or immediate family members.""According to IANS, the women’s wing will be led by Sadiya Azhar, sister of Masood Azhar. Her husband, Yusuf Azhar, was killed during Operation Sindoor on May 7, when Indian forces targeted JeM’s previous base, Markaz Subhanallah.""His other sister Samaira Azhar, and Afeera Farooq, widow of Pulwama attacker Umar Farooq, are also part of the leadership,"" sources confirmed, adding that “they are tasked with conducting daily online sessions to motivate and recruit women.”JeM has since verified these details in a new poster naming Umme Masood (real name Samaira Azhar) as the instructor for online classes, conducted five days a week from October 25.Azhar further reveals that Jamaat-ul-Mominaat includes “4–5 women whose male relatives were killed in encounters with the Indian Army,” who will inspire new recruits under a campaign called “Shoba-e-Dawat.”He urges women cadres to read his book “Ae Musalman Behna” (O Muslim Sister) as part of their indoctrination.It is significant that 14 members of Masood Azhar’s family were killed in India’s Operation Sindoor, including Yousuf Azhar, Jameel Ahmed, Hamza Jameel, and Huzaifa Azhar. Azhar now claims that his elder sister Hawa Bibi also died in the same strike.In the audio, an emotional Azhar recounts that he had conceptualised the idea of a women’s brigade with his sister before her death.In retaliation for the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir, which claimed the lives of 26 civilians, India launched a major military operation targeting Pakistan-based terror infrastructure. The counterterror action, named Operation Sindoor, struck nine key terror hubs across Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.The strikes destroyed major bases of Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), including their headquarters in Bahawalpur and Muridke, which were reduced to rubble by precision airstrikes carried out by the Indian armed forces.In response, Pakistan attempted retaliation by launching multiple drones and missiles towards Indian territory the following night. However, India’s advanced air defence systems swiftly intercepted and neutralised the incoming threats, preventing any casualties or damage.India then answered this provocation with targeted strikes on crucial Pakistani airbases, including the strategically significant Nur Khan Airbase and Rahim Yar Khan Airbase.The heightened military tensions between the two neighbours were eventually de-escalated following a mutual peace agreement, initiated by Pakistan’s Director General of Military Operations (DGMO).Since then, these outfits have reportedly relocated to Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) region to avoid further strikes. Their leaders have been issuing propaganda messages and appeals for funds to rebuild their networks.Media sources also reveal that Masood Azhar has been aggressively collecting donations. During his September 27 address at Markaz Usman o Ali, he publicly appealed for financial support.JeM is now collecting a donation of 500 PKR from every woman enrolling in the new course and requiring them to fill out online registration forms.Earlier, on October 8, Masood Azhar formally announced the formation of Jamaat-ul-Mominaat, followed by an event titled “Dukhtaran-e-Islam” in Rawalakot, PoK, on October 19, aimed at drawing women into the organisation.While groups like ISIS, Boko Haram, Hamas, and LTTE have long deployed women in combat and suicide missions, organisations such as JeM, LeT, and Hizbul Mujahideen had largely avoided such practices -- until now. Security agencies believe JeM’s latest move signals its intent to train and deploy female suicide bombers in future terror operations.","Jaish-e-Mohammed announces formation of women's wing, 'Jamaat-ul-Mominaat' JeM's chief Masood Azhar releases 21-minute audio message from group's Bahawalpur headquarters, Markaz Usman o Ali.

What Afghanistan said







Pakistan has issued a stark warning to the Taliban regime in Afghanistan after the peace talks in Turkey failed to bear any outcome on Tuesday. Boasting Pakistan's defence arsenal, its Pakwarned that ""not require to employ even a fraction of its full arsenal to completely obliterate the Taliban regime and push them back to the caves for hiding. ""“Let me assure them that Pakistan does not require to employ even a fraction of its full arsenal to completely obliterate the Taliban regime and push them back to the caves for hiding. If they wish so, the repeat of the scenes of their rout at Tora Bora, with their tails between the legs, would surely be a spectacle to watch for the people of the region,” Dawn reported Asif saying.Kabul has blamed Pakistan for the failed peace talks in Turkey after Islamabad disagreed ""to stop violating Afghan airspace and prevent US drone flights,"" Tolo News reported citing sources.The violence, which left more than 70 people dead and wounded hundreds more, erupted after a series of explosions in Kabul on October 9, attacks that Taliban authorities have attributed to Pakistan. The two sides had been engaged in peace talks in Istanbul at the time.Pakistan information minister Attaullah Tarar on Wednesday informed in a post on X that the talks between the two nations had no conclusion as the ""Afghan side gave no assurances, kept deviating from the core issue.""""Regrettably, the Afghan side gave no assurances, kept deviating from the core issue and resorted to blame game, deflection and ruses,"" AFP quoted Tarar saying. ""The dialogue thus failed to bring about any workable solution.""Adding to this, Asif took a more firm stance warning Afghanistan against any ""terrorist attack or any suicide bombing inside Pakistan"".“We have borne your treachery and mockery for too long, but no more. Any terrorist attack or any suicide bombing inside Pakistan shall give you the bitter taste of such misadventures. Be rest assured and test our resolve and capabilities, if you wish so, at your own peril and doom,” Dawn quoted Asif saying.Though there has been no direct statements from Kabul's side, media reports stated that the talks broke down as ""Pakistani delegation reportedly presented demands that were also unacceptable to both sides.""According to Tolo News, sources said Islamabad pressed the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan to formally classify the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) as a terrorist organization and to act against the group.Reacting to this, Afghanistan defence minister Mawlawi Mohammad Yaqoob Mujahid, said, “Pakistan and other countries use the label of terrorism for political purposes against their opponents.”However, a Pakistani security source said the Afghan delegation initially agreed to act decisively against the TTP but repeatedly backtracked under instructions from Kabul, AFP reported.Following the October 9 Kabul explosions, the Taliban launched a border offensive—prompting Pakistani strikes in response. A 48-hour ceasefire collapsed before a new truce was reached on October 19 in Doha, with Qatar and Turkey mediating. The border has now been shut for over two weeks, allowing only expelled Afghans to cross, leaving goods stranded and spoiling in places like Spin Boldak.","Kabul has blamed Pakistan for the failed peace talks in Turkey after Islamabad disagreed ""to stop violating Afghan airspace and prevent US drone flights,"" Tolo News reported citing sources.

Pakistan repeats old claims





Pakistan's defence minister Khawaja Asif on Tuesday warned Afghanistan that if the attack on Islamabad continues, then they will give a 50 times stronger response, and accused Kabul of acting as a puppet for India.The remarks came after peace talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan in Istanbul dramatically collapsed.Speaking on Geo News programme ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada ke Saath’, Asif Kabul, using Pakistan’s familiar playbook of deflection, claimed that Kabul was merely a puppet in India’s hands.He said “I would compliment their delegation, but the people in Kabul pulling the strings and staging the puppet show are being controlled by Delhi.""""India is compensating for its defeat on their western border through Kabul. The junta there (in Afghanistan) has elements that have visited India and visited their temples,"" Asif claimed. ""India wants to engage in a low-intensity war with Pakistan. To achieve this, they are using Kabul,"" he added.When asked to comment on threats by Afghanistan that they would “attack Islamabad” in the event of further hostilities, Asif replied: “If Afghanistan even looks at Islamabad, we will gouge their eyes out.“They can employ the use of terrorists and they already are. Over the past four years, they have been using terrorists,” he added.“There should be no doubt that Kabul is responsible for the terrorism in Pakistan. Kabul is a tool for Delhi. If they want to, God forbid, attack Islamabad, we will give a befitting response. A response 50 times stronger,” the defence minister said.Kabul had previously rejected Islamabad’s accusations as unfounded.Still, the Pakistani minister praised the Afghan negotiators for their cooperation — even as he directed sharp criticism at the Kabul leadership.This is not the first time. Earlier also, Pakistan claimed India was behind a recent assault in Afghanistan. Ministry of external affairs dismissed Pakistan’s accusations that India was behind a recent assault in Afghanistan, saying Islamabad’s record of harbouring terrorism was well knownAt the weekly press briefing, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, “Three things are clear. One, Pakistan hosts terrorist organisations and sponsors terrorist activities. Two, it is an old practice of Pakistan to blame its neighbours for its own internal failures. Three, Pakistan is infuriated with Afghanistan exercising sovereignty over its own territories.""The remarks followed the collapse of the latest round of peace talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan in Turkey. According to Afghan and Pakistani sources cited by Reuters, both sides had earlier agreed to a ceasefire on October 19 in Doha but failed to make progress in Istanbul.Each country blamed the other for the stalemate. The discussions, mediated by Turkey and Qatar, concluded on Monday without any breakthrough.","Pakistan's defence minister Khawaja Asif warned Afghanistan that if the attack on Islamabad continues, then they will give a 50 times stronger response.

Twin Trouble For Pak! After India, Afghanistan May Restrict River Water Supply To Pakistan

Pak, Afghan play the blame game







Pakistan, Afghanistan peace talks in Turkey have hit an impasse with both the nations pointing fingers at each other for failure to reach a deal, the Associated Press reported on Tuesday. Istanbul has been consistent in its efforts to end the deadlock, however, there has been no immediate confirmations whether a fourth day of talks would be held.The Istanbul talks form a key element of a wider diplomatic effort to defuse months of rising friction between Islamabad and Kabul over cross-border militancy and alleged safe havens, long-standing flashpoints that have only intensified since the Taliban reclaimed power in Afghanistan four years ago.There has been no official statement about the status of the talks.Pakistan and Afghanistan have blamed each other for the deadlock, as efforts to build on last month’s ceasefire remain stalled. Both sides accused the other of lacking seriousness in talks aimed at easing cross-border tensions that recently erupted into deadly clashes.Pakistani security officials involved in the negotiations said Kabul was refusing to accept what Islamabad considers “logical and legitimate” demands -- assurances that Afghan soil would not be used for attacks in Pakistan, according to AP.They argued that the Taliban delegation had been reluctant to commit to concrete guarantees and repeatedly sought guidance from Kabul before making decisions.The Afghan side, however, countered those claims. While Kabul did not immediately issue a formal response, state-run broadcaster RTA asserted that Afghanistan has “made every effort to hold constructive talks,” but that “the Pakistani side does not seem to have this intention.” The accusation mirrors Pakistan’s criticism and underscores a widening diplomatic rift.Despite the stalemate, Turkish officials and other international mediators have been working to preserve the ceasefire brokered in Doha on October 19, after fighting along the border left dozens of soldiers, militants and civilians dead on both sides.","Pakistan and Afghanistan have blamed each other for the deadlock, as efforts to build on last month’s ceasefire remain stalled.

Should India Engage With Taliban Amid Pak-Afghan Truce? Ex-Diplomat Explains| India Connect





The latest round of peace talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan has reportedly hit a stalemate, with Islamabad accusing the Afghan Taliban of taking an “illogical and detached” position on key security issues, including cooperation against cross-border militancy, Geo News reported.The second phase of discussions, held in Istanbul on Saturday, came a week after the initial negotiations in Doha following an October 16 ceasefire that ended the deadliest border clashes between the two sides since the Taliban seized power in 2021.Citing official sources, Geo News said Pakistan presented “clear, evidence-based and solution-oriented” demands urging Kabul to act against militant groups operating from Afghan soil. However, the Taliban delegation allegedly remained “unwilling to cooperate or acknowledge ground realities.”The talks in Istanbul, mediated by Turkey’s intelligence chief Ibrahim Kalin, focused on creating a joint monitoring mechanism to curb militant movement across the border and facilitate smoother trade. Radio Pakistan reported that both sides also discussed the possibility of a long-term political framework to stabilise relations.According to reports, Turkey is attempting to bridge the gap by helping the Taliban delegation understand the seriousness of Pakistan’s security concerns. Islamabad has reportedly conveyed its final position, warning that any tolerance or shelter for militants targeting its territory “will not be acceptable.”Sources told Geo News that progress in the talks now hinges entirely on the Taliban’s attitude and readiness to cooperate in good faith. Pakistani officials described the Taliban’s responses during the exchanges as “illogical and detached from ground realities,” further deepening doubts about Kabul’s sincerity.During the discussions, Pakistan pressed the Taliban regime to dismantle terrorist networks and prevent militant infiltration. Kabul’s delegation submitted a written response to Islamabad’s proposals late Sunday night.The ongoing negotiations mark the second round of peace efforts, following the Doha talks where both sides agreed to a ceasefire mediated by Qatar and Turkey after intense cross-border clashes.The conflict saw multiple days of heavy clashes across the border of two neighbours. Pakistani forces claimed they killed over 200 Taliban fighters, while 23 soldiers lost their lives, according to media reports. Following the violence, key border crossings were shut, citing security concerns.Meanwhile, Pakistani defence minister Khawaja Asif has warned of an “all-out war” if the peace efforts fail.","The latest round of peace talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan has reportedly hit a stalemate.

Hundreds Killed, 1000 Injured As Powerful Quake Flattens Afghanistan | Shocking Scenes On Cam

Why is Afghanistan so prone to earthquakes?





A powerful 6.3-magnitude earthquake struck northern Afghanistan early Monday near the city of Mazar-e-Sharif. The quake claimed the lives of at least 20 and injured more than 300, with authorities warning that the toll could rise.According to the US Geological Survey, the quake occurred at a depth of 28 kilometers (17.4 miles) near the city, which is home to about 523,000 people.Videos circulating on social media showed the widespread destruction caused by the quake, with footage capturing residents rushing out of their homes as buildings shook and partially collapsed.The earthquake also damaged parts of the holy shrine in Mazar-i-Sharif, according to Balkh province spokesperson Haji Zaid, as reported by Reuters.The US Geological Survey (USGS) issued an orange alert through its PAGER system, which provides automated assessments of earthquake impacts.It warned that “significant casualties are likely and the disaster is potentially widespread.” The alert noted that past earthquakes of similar intensity have typically required regional or national-level responses.Eastern and northeastern Afghanistan, particularly areas bordering Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Pakistan, are highly prone to earthquakes.Afghanistan lies on the edge of the Eurasian tectonic plate, where it meets the Indian plate and is also affected by the Arabian plate to the south.This makes it one of the world’s most earthquake-prone regions. Most quakes occur due to the Indian plate pushing northward against the Eurasian plate.Heavily populated Kabul suffers the highest average earthquake damage in Afghanistan, estimated at about $17 million annually, according to a study cited by Reuters.Quakes are especially dangerous in the country’s mountainous regions, where they often trigger landslides that worsen destruction and casualties.Since 1900, Afghanistan has recorded nearly 100 “damaging” earthquakes. One of the strongest, a 7.5-magnitude quake in 2015, killed 399 people across Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India.In August, another powerful earthquake and a series of strong aftershocks struck southeastern Afghanistan, killing more than 2,200 people and injuring thousands.","A powerful 6.3-magnitude earthquake struck northern Afghanistan early Monday near the city of Mazar-e-Sharif.

The Trump administration is planning a major expansion of its travel ban, which could soon cover citizens from 36 additional countries. Earlier this month, the Republican president issued an order blocking citizens from 12 countries from entering the United States.According to an internal US State Department cable seen by Reuters and first reported by the Washington Post, these nations risk being added to the list unless they address specific security concerns within 60 days.The cable, signed by US secretary of state Marco Rubio, lists various issues that have triggered these concerns. Among them are countries failing to issue reliable identity documents, having weak or uncooperative governments, poor passport security, and refusing to accept their citizens who have been ordered to leave the United States.Some countries were also flagged for their citizens' involvement in terrorism, antisemitic activities, or anti-American actions. However, the cable noted that not every concern applied to all countries listed.During Trump’s first term, he had already introduced a controversial travel ban on several Muslim-majority nations, a policy that faced multiple legal challenges before being upheld by the US Supreme Court in 2018.The 36 countries now at risk of facing either full or partial bans include:This would add to the ban announced earlier this month, which already restricts travel from 12 nations such as Afghanistan, Myanmar, Iran, Libya, Somalia, and Yemen. There are also partial restrictions on travellers from countries like Venezuela, Cuba, Laos, and Sierra Leone.","The 36 countries now at risk of facing either full or partial bans include:This would add to the ban announced earlier this month.

US President Donald Trump on Monday slammed the Barack Obama and Justin Trudeau administration for excluding Russia from the G8 member nations which then became G7. Calling it a ""serious mistake"", he added that if he would have been the president, there wouldn't have been a Russia-Ukraine war.""The G7 used to be the G8. About nine years ago, Russia was excluded, something I believe was a serious mistake. Back then, leaders like Barack Obama and Justin Trudeau didn’t want Russia involved, but had Russia remained at the table, perhaps we wouldn’t be facing a war today. If I was the president 4 years ago, we would not have a war right now,"" he said.The G7 temporarily became the G8 when Russia was included as a member, but the country was expelled in 2014 following its annexation of Crimea and initial incursion into Ukraine—developments that laid the groundwork for its full-scale invasion in 2022.Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin had a phone call on Saturday and the two agreed that the escalating conflict between Iran and Israel should come to an end.“President Putin called this morning to very nicely wish me a Happy Birthday, but to more importantly, talk about Iran, a country he knows very well,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “He feels, as do I, this war in Israel-Iran should end, to which I explained, his war should also end,” he added.The call also briefly touched on Russia’s war in Ukraine and ongoing prisoner exchanges. Trump noted that while Ukraine wasn’t the main focus of the call, they discussed upcoming exchanges and Putin's interest in resuming peace talks after June 22.","The G7 temporarily became the G8 when Russia was included as a member, but the country was expelled in 2014 following its annexation of Crimea and initial incursion into Ukraine.

Trump Turns To 'MEDIATOR' Putin; Russia Hints At Big Israeli Attack, Pulls Out Citizens From Tehran





President Donald Trump said Sunday the United States is not involved in Israel's military strikes against Iran at this moment, but ""it's possible we could be involved"".

It's possible we could get involved. But we are not at this moment involved,"" the president said.Trump also shared that he had a lengthy call with Russian President Vladimir Putin Saturday to discuss, in large part, the conflict in the Middle East.

Netanyahu makes SHOCKING claim about Trump assassination attempts, his own





Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has claimed that Iran's Islamic regime sees US President Donald Trump as its biggest threat and even tried to assassinate him.Speaking to Fox News on Sunday, Netanyahu said, ""They want to kill him. He’s enemy number one.""Netanyahu also praised Trump for taking a tough stand against Iran's nuclear programme, rejecting previous agreements that allowed uranium enrichment and cancelling the nuclear deal. Netanyahu said Trump’s actions — including ordering the killing of Iranian general Qasem Soleimani — made him a key target for Tehran.""He took up this fake agreement and basically tore it up. He killed Qasem Soleimani. He made it very clear, including now, 'You cannot have a nuclear weapon, which means you cannot enrich uranium.' He's been very forceful, so for them, he's enemy number one,"" Fox News quoted Netanyahu as saying.The Israeli leader also revealed that his own life was targeted when a missile struck the bedroom window of his home. Calling himself Trump’s ""junior partner"" in confronting Iran, Netanyahu said both leaders have stood firm against Tehran's efforts to develop nuclear weapons.Describing the current situation, Netanyahu warned that Israel faced an ""imminent"" threat of nuclear destruction. He said Iran was moving fast to weaponise enriched uranium and expand its ballistic missile arsenal, producing thousands of missiles capable of striking Israeli cities. ""No country can sustain that, and certainly not a country the size of Israel, so we had to act,"" he said.Netanyahu defended Israel’s military campaign, Operation Rising Lion, calling it ""one of the greatest military operations in history."" He said the strikes have significantly set back Iran’s nuclear programme and dismissed the possibility of meaningful negotiations with Tehran.He also accused Iran's leaders of oppressing their people for 50 years while pursuing the destruction of Israel.","Netanyahu claims Iran's Islamic regime sees US President Donald Trump as its biggest threat and even tried to assassinate him.

Leaders of Group of Seven (G7) nations meeting in Canada on Monday issued a joint statement declaring that ""Iran can never have a nuclear weapon,"" while calling for immediate de-escalation across the Middle East.The statement comes days after Israel conducted its Operation Rising Lion to hit Iran's nuclear facilities.In the joint statement, the G7 reaffirmed its stance on Iran’s nuclear ambitions and voiced support for Israel’s right to self-defence.""We affirm that Israel has a right to defend itself,"" the statement said. ""We have been consistently clear that Iran can never have a nuclear weapon.""The leaders urged that the resolution of the Iranian crisis be part of a broader effort to calm the region. ""We urge that the resolution of the Iranian crisis leads to a broader de-escalation of hostilities in the Middle East, including a ceasefire in Gaza,"" the statement continued.The summit was significantly disrupted by escalating tensions between Israel and Iran, which have taken center stage since Israel began bombing Iranian military and nuclear targets four days ago.Amid these developments, US President Donald Trump abruptly left the summit on Monday, a day earlier than scheduled.Speaking before his departure, Trump issued a sharp warning to Tehran.""They have to make a deal,"" he said, referring to Iran’s failure to reach an agreement on curbing its nuclear ambitions within a 60-day window before the Israeli strikes began.Trump specified the urgency of the situation, saying, ""Tehran should be evacuated immediately,"" and added that Iran’s leaders would “like to talk” but time was running out.When pressed on what would prompt direct US military involvement in the conflict, Trump declined to provide specifics.

HELLSCAPE Tel Aviv! Iran’s Terrifying Attack Quakes Israeli City; IDF ‘Fails’ To Intercept Missiles





Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday accused Iran of pushing the region toward a ""forever war"" and warned the situation is approaching the ""brink of a nuclear war.""In a wide-ranging interview with ABC News, Netanyahu argued that the only way to end hostilities is by directly targeting the Iranian regime's leadership - including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.When asked about reports that US President Donald Trump rejected an Israeli proposal to assassinate Khamenei due to fears of escalation, Netanyahu countered, ""It's not going to escalate the conflict, it's going to end the conflict.""The remarks come as tensions between Israel and Iran have surged since a wave of airstrikes and missile exchanges erupted late last week. Netanyahu squarely blamed Iran for regional instability, pointing to its alleged involvement in attacks across the Middle East.""We've had half a century of conflict spread by this regime that terrorizes everyone in the Middle East; has bombed the Aramco oil fields in Saudi Arabia; is spreading terrorism and subversion and sabotage everywhere,"" he said.""The 'forever war' is what Iran wants, and they're bringing us to the brink of nuclear war. In fact, what Israel is doing is preventing this, bringing an end to this aggression, and we can only do so by standing up to the forces of evil.""Asked directly if Israel would target Iran’s supreme leader, Netanyahu responded, ""We're doing what we need to do."" He added, ""I'm not going to get into the details, but we've targeted their top nuclear scientists. It's basically Hitler's nuclear team.""Netanyahu appealed to American interests, warning that the threat Iran poses is not limited to Israel. ""Today, it's Tel Aviv. Tomorrow, it's New York. Look, I understand 'America First'. I don't understand 'America Dead'. That's what these people want. They chant 'Death to America.'""""So we're doing something that is in the service of mankind, of humanity, and it's a battle of good against evil. America does, should, and does stand with the good. That's what President Trump is doing, And I deeply appreciate his support,"" he said.The Israeli leader also dismissed a Wall Street Journal report that Iran is seeking to de-escalate and resume nuclear talks. ""I'm not surprised. I mean, they want to continue to have these fake talks in which they lie, they cheat, they string the US along. And, you know, we have very solid Intel on that,"" he said. ""They want to keep on building their nuclear weapons and building their mass ballistic missile arsenal, which they're firing at our people. ""He rejected the idea of halting strikes in exchange for renewed diplomacy, adding, ""They want to continue to create the two existential threats against Israel while they're talking. That's not going to happen.""When asked about criticism from US conservatives like commentator Tucker Carlson who oppose military support for Israel, Netanyahu reiterated the global threat he believes Iran poses: ""Iran is a threat to the entire world.""The Israeli PM again echoed his recent birthday message to President Trump, saying, ""We're not just fighting our enemy. We're fighting your enemy. For God's sake, they chant, 'death to Israel, death to America.' We're simply on their way. And this could reach America soon.""Pressed on whether he would halt military action if President Trump requested a diplomatic pause, Netanyahu was non-committal but praised Trump’s leadership: ""Well, President Trump has been a great leader, a great leader of the world, and a great leader and a great friend of Israel, and he put forward the terms very clearly in the negotiations.""""He said Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon, and in order for it not to have a nuclear weapon, it cannot have the capacity to enrich uranium, which is the prerequisite for nuclear weapons.""","Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Iran of pushing the region toward a ""forever war"" Netanyahu argued that the only way to end hostilities is by directly targeting the Iranian regime's leadership - including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

As night attacks stretch into Tuesday morning, global leaders express concern while military actions intensify between Israel and Iran. Confrontation have escalated sharply, with fresh explosions reported in Tehran late Monday night.State-linked Fars News Agency said Iran’s air defences were activated over the capital after blasts were heard in the eastern part of the city.Iran’s Revolutionary Guards announced the ninth wave of drone and missile strikes targeting Israel. A spokesman for the Guards said these attacks would continue “without interruption until dawn,” highlighting Iran’s intent to sustain pressure overnight.In a retaliatory warning, Iranian authorities have told Israel to evacuate the headquarters of Channels 12 and 14. This followed an Israeli airstrike on IRINN, a state-run television channel in Tehran on Monday, which forced a news presenter to flee during a live broadcast.Iranian authorities have claimed that they uncovered and shut down a drone manufacturing site in Tehran allegedly linked to Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency. According to Iranian state media, two individuals accused of working with Mossad were arrested in separate operations in Tehran and Alborz provinces.The Israel Defence Forces have confirmed missile detections across several areas following Iran’s latest wave of attacks. Sirens were activated as part of emergency procedures, and the Israeli Air Force has launched strikes on missile infrastructure in western Iran. Israeli officials claim to have achieved air superiority over Tehran, saying that a significant portion of Iran’s missile launchers has already been destroyed.The United States has moved quickly to adjust its military posture in the Middle East. Defence secretary Pete Hegseth confirmed the deployment of additional assets to the region, saying the move is meant to enhance the safety of American forces. In a statement on social media, Hegseth said, “Protecting US forces is our top priority”.Tehran has submitted a formal complaint to the United Nations, accusing Israel of deliberately targeting its nuclear facilities. In a letter to UN Secretary-General António Guterres and the Security Council, Iran’s representative, Amir Saeid Iravani, cited recent Israeli airstrikes on the Natanz nuclear complex and referred to a 1981 Security Council resolution condemning similar actions.Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has strongly criticised Israel’s actions, saying they undermine ongoing nuclear negotiations with the United States. During calls with foreign ministers from France, Britain, Germany, and the European Union, Araghchi said that Israel’s military aggression is “a blow to diplomacy.”US president Donald Trump has urged Iran to agree to a deal, repeating his warning that Iran must not be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons. In a social media post, he told residents of Tehran to “immediately evacuate” and criticised Iran for not signing the deal he had earlier proposed. Despite the worsening crisis, Trump has not joined other G7 leaders in calling for de-escalation. The White House later confirmed that Trump would leave the G7 summit in Canada a day early to focus on the unfolding conflict.","Iran’s Revolutionary Guards announced the ninth wave of drone and missile strikes targeting Israel.

Group 1: Work 8 hours per day from Monday to Thursday and take Friday off entirely.





Group 2: Work 7 hours per day from Monday to Thursday, and 4.5 hours on Friday.





Results from the Previous Trial Phase

Led to enhanced productivity





Created more positive work environments





Achieved a 98% satisfaction rate among participating employees, based on official evaluation systems





Longer Weekends and Broader Worker Welfare Measures





Dubai has officially reintroduced its seasonal workplace initiative, ‘Our Flexible Summer’, offering government employees flexible working hours aimed at boosting productivity and enhancing work-life balance during the scorching summer period.The Dubai Government Human Resources Department (DGHR) confirmed that the initiative will run from July 1 to September 12, 2025, and will apply across government entities at each department’s discretion. This follows a successful pilot conducted in 2024.“This is all about supporting a better work-life balance for our government teams,” the DGHR said in a public statement, highlighting the initiative’s aim to make summer “a little cooler” for public sector staff.Under the temporary model, the standard five-day workweek remains in place, but employees can choose from two flexible scheduling options:The choice of implementation is left to each government department, allowing flexibility across different operations.The DGHR stated that the initiative “comes after the successful trial run earlier this year” and is intended to increase employee happiness and overall productivity during the UAE’s peak summer months.The program isn’t new. In 2024, the Dubai Government rolled out a similar model between August 12 and September 30 across 21 government entities.According to data analysed from that pilot, the initiative:The results confirmed that flexible working arrangements could have a measurable impact on both employee wellbeing and departmental performance.This year’s expanded rollout reflects the government’s confidence in the model’s success.Currently, most government employees in Dubai enjoy a two-and-a-half-day weekend, with a half-day on Friday, and full days on Saturday and Sunday. The new schedule will allow some staff to enjoy a full three-day weekend, depending on the group selected.In parallel, the UAE continues to implement additional summer workforce protections, particularly for outdoor and field-based workers.As of June 15, the Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MoHRE) began enforcing the annual midday break, which bans work under direct sunlight from 12:30 PM to 3:00 PM, daily until September 15.MoHRE inspectors have already begun site checks, with fines of Dh5,000 per worker for violations, up to a maximum of Dh50,000 in cases involving multiple breaches.In addition, the ministry has set up over 10,000 air-conditioned rest stations across the country to support delivery service workers, helping them cope with extreme heat during the peak season.","'Our Flexible Summer' initiative will run from July 1 to September 12, 2025.

CAIRO: Israeli fire and airstrikes killed at least 23 Palestinians across the Gaza Strip, most of them near an aid distribution site operated by the U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, local health authorities said.Medics at Al-Awda and Al-Aqsa Hospitals in central Gaza areas, where most of the casualties were moved to, said at least 15 people were killed as they tried to approach the GHF aid distribution site near the Netzarim corridor.The rest were killed in separate attacks across the enclave, they added.There has been no immediate comment by the Israeli military or the GHF on Saturday's incidents.The GHF began distributing food packages in Gaza at the end of May, overseeing a new model of aid distribution which the United Nations says is neither impartial nor neutral.The Gaza health ministry said in a statement on Saturday at least 274 people have so far been killed, and more than 2,000 wounded, near aid distribution sites since the GHF began operations in Gaza.Later on Saturday, the Israeli military ordered residents of Khan Younis and the nearby towns of Abassan and Bani Suhaila in the southern Gaza Strip to leave their homes and head west towards the so-called humanitarian zone area, saying it would forcefully work against ""terror organizations"" in the area.The war in Gaza erupted 20 months ago after Hamas-led militants raided Israel and took 251 hostages and killed 1,200 people, most of them civilians, on October 7, 2023, Israel's single deadliest day.Israel's military campaign since has killed nearly 55,000 Palestinians, most of them civilians, according to health authorities in Gaza, and flattened much of the densely populated strip, which is home to more than two million people.Most of the population is displaced, and malnutrition is widespread.Despite efforts by the United States, Egypt, and Qatar to restore a ceasefire in Gaza, neither Israel nor Hamas has shown willingness to back down on core demands, with each side blaming the other for the failure to reach a deal.","Israeli fire and airstrikes killed at least 23 Palestinians across the Gaza Strip, most of them near an aid distribution site operated by the U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.

In Tabriz, images showed damage at multiple sites on the base.Meanwhile, at the Natanz nuclear enrichment facility, southwest of Iranian capital Tehran, the images show multiple buildings either damaged or destroyed; the targeted sites included structures experts say supplied power to the facility. The Natanz photos were taken by Maxar Technologies.At the now-destroyed Natanz plant, Iran had enriched uranium to 60% purity - a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%.While all the Natanz facilities damaged in the strikes are above ground, it didn't appear that there was any apparent impact on the site's underground enrichment halls.Iran has not acknowledged the damage, though it reported on Israeli strikes in the area.Satellite images also reveal impact at sites such as the nuclear facility at Piranshahr, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps' (IRGC) Ghadir site, and the Fordow fuel enrichment plant.Under its Operation Rising Lion, Israel conducted strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities.

Iran Launches Massive Attack On Israel; Haifa Refinery Burns, Sirens Wail Across Northern Israel





DUBAI: Israel's defence minister warned Saturday that ""Tehran will burn"" if Iran continues firing missiles, as the countries traded blows a day after Israel launched a blistering surprise attack on Iranian nuclear and military sites, killing several top generals.The attacks have left Iran's surviving leadership with the difficult decision of plunging deeper into conflict with Israel's more powerful forces or seeking a diplomatic route. Israel - which is widely believed to have a nuclear weapons programme - said its hundreds of strikes on Iran over the past two days also killed nine senior scientists and experts involved in Iran's nuclear programme.Iran's UN ambassador said 78 people were killed and more than 320 wounded.Iran retaliated by launching waves of drones and ballistic missiles at Israel, where explosions lit the night skies over Jerusalem and Tel Aviv and shook buildings. The Israeli military urged civilians, already rattled by the war in Gaza sparked by Hamas' Oct 7 attack, to head to shelter for hours. Health officials said three people were killed and dozens wounded. Defence minister Israel Katz said Iran will pay a heavy price for harming Israeli citizens.""If (Iran Supreme leader) Khamenei continues to fire missiles at the Israeli home front - Tehran will burn,"" Katz said.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Friday that his objective was to eliminate any Iranian threat to Israel, but he also urged Iranians to rise up against their leaders.The US and Iran were scheduled to be in Oman on Sunday for their sixth round of indirect talks over Iran's nuclear programme. Iran's top diplomat said Saturday the talks were ""unjustifiable"" after the Israeli strikes, likely signalling no negotiations this weekend. But he stopped short of saying the talks were cancelled.Iran launched waves of missiles at Israel late Friday and early Saturday, and Iranians awoke to state television airing repeated clips of strikes on Israel, as well as videos of people cheering and handing out sweets. The Iranian attacks killed at least three people and wounded 76, mostly in and around Tel Aviv, according to two local hospitals. One missile severely damaged at least four homes in the nearby city of Rishon Lezion, according to first responders.The Israeli military said seven soldiers were lightly wounded when a missile hit central Israel, without specifying where. It was the first report of Israeli military casualties since the initial Israeli strikes.US ground-based air defence systems in the region were helping to shoot down Iranian missiles, said a US official who spoke on condition of anonymity.In Ramat Gan, east of Tel Aviv, an Associated Press journalist saw burned-out cars and at least three damaged houses, including one whose front was nearly entirely torn away. Residents of a central Israeli city that was hit Friday night told the AP the explosion was so powerful it shook their shelter door open.Israeli police said debris from the interception of drones and missiles fell in dozens of locations in northern Israel, causing damage and fires but no injuries.

A senior Israeli official has indicated that Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei could become a direct target, as Israel intensifies its campaign against Iranian nuclear and military infrastructure.In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, the unnamed official said assassination of Iran’s top leader is ""not off limits,"" underlining a dramatic escalation in Israel’s strategic posture.The statement signals a shift from solely targeting Iran’s nuclear program to potentially dismantling the regime’s leadership structure.The official claimed that Israel’s recent strikes have already inflicted substantial damage, including at the heavily fortified Natanz enrichment facility, where structural collapse was reported. Israel has also taken responsibility for the assassinations of nine nuclear scientists and several high-ranking military officers in recent months.Additional strikes are expected soon, as part of the ongoing Israeli offensive known as 'Operation Rising Lion'. Meanwhile, Iran’s counter-offensive, 'Operation True Promise III' entered a new phase on Saturday with another wave of missile attacks launched toward Israeli territory.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed the attack, stating: ""A short while ago, the IDF identified missiles launched from Iran toward the territory of the State of Israel. Defensive systems are operating to intercept the threat.""Sirens sounded across major cities, including Tel Aviv, as authorities activated emergency protocols.In response, Israeli warplanes struck targets in Tehran overnight, further intensifying a rapidly escalating confrontation that threatens to engulf the region.Addressing the nation earlier, Supreme Leader Khamenei vowed retribution: “We will not permit them to evade consequences for this significant wrongdoing they have perpetrated,” he said in a televised speech.The escalating exchange has raised global concerns, particularly over the potential targeting of political leaders and the vulnerability of deeply buried nuclear facilities.

A major fire broke out on Saturday at the 67-storey Marina Pinnacle building in Dubai Marina, prompting a large-scale emergency response and the safe evacuation of all 3,820 residents from 764 apartments. Authorities confirmed there were no injuries.The fire, which was extinguished after nearly six hours of effort, drew swift intervention from Dubai Civil Defence teams, who worked through the night to contain the blaze. In a series of updates on X, the Dubai Media Office (DMO) said: “Specialised teams successfully evacuated all residents… prioritising their health and safety throughout the operation.”Medical and psychological support teams were on-site to assist residents. “Ambulance teams and medical staff are on site to offer full medical and mental support to the safely evacuated residents,” DMO posted at 2:09 am.Authorities also assured that temporary housing arrangements were being made in coordination with the building’s developer to ensure the affected residents' well-being.As firefighting operations continued, Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) suspended tram services between Dubai Marina Station (No.5) and Palm Jumeirah Station (No. 9) as a precautionary measure. A replacement shuttle bus service was activated, with the RTA stating, “The safety of our passengers and operations is our top priority.”Tram services will resume only after full safety inspections are conducted, the authority added.Eyewitnesses described the situation as tense, with one resident noting: “At around 1:30am, the fire started to slow down… plenty of debris has been falling.”Thanks to swift action, no surrounding buildings were affected. Authorities are now monitoring the structure and will conduct a thorough investigation to determine the cause of the fire, which remains undisclosed.This is not the first fire reported at Marina Pinnacle — also known as Tiger Tower. In May 2015, a kitchen fire on the 47th floor had spread to the floor above before being contained.Despite the building's fire history, Saturday’s operation stands out for its scale, coordination, and zero casualty outcome — underscoring Dubai’s emergency preparedness.","A major fire broke out on Saturday at the 67-storey Marina Pinnacle building in Dubai Marina, prompting a large-scale emergency response.

Poll Do you think President Trump's warning about potential future strikes by Israel is justified? Yes, it's justified No, it's an exaggeration





In the wake of Israel’s sweeping military strikes on Iran, foreign policy analysts suggest that China may be the conflict’s biggest geopolitical loser.“Iran being set back on its heels by Israel means nothing is off the table for China and its military advances,” said Gordon Chang, senior fellow at the Gatestone Institute, in an interview on Fox Business Network’s Varney & Co on Friday.According to Chang, Iran has long served as a vehicle for China’s foreign policy goals in the Middle East. “The Chinese… they’re losing their proxy, Iran. Iran has been accomplishing China’s foreign policy goals for quite some time. And China’s Middle East policy is now in disarray,” he stated.The comments came after the Israel defense forces launched Operation Rising Lion, a large-scale assault targeting Iran’s nuclear and missile infrastructure. Explosions were reported in Tehran overnight Friday, as Israel responded to months of failed nuclear negotiations. A nationwide state of emergency has been declared in Israel in anticipation of Iranian retaliation.Chang warned that China may not quietly accept the blow to its regional ambitions. “This is a point where China is suffering a terrible loss in the Middle East,” he said. “It is not going to take that lying down, and it’s probably going to get Iran or some other party to strike us.”China’s support for Iran has been extensive, particularly through oil and weapons trade. “China was supporting the attacks on Israel across the board with elevated commodity purchases,” Chang explained. “Remember, China has taken more than 90% of Iran’s crude oil exports, but also provided weapons support.”He added that Chinese-made arms are widespread among Iran-backed militias. “Hamas, Houthi militia, Hezbollah, all of them have large quantities of Chinese weapons. Iran’s weapons are made with China’s computer chips,” he noted.Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump weighed in on the conflict via Truth Social, warning that Israel’s next round of strikes could be “even more brutal” if Iran does not return to the negotiating table over its nuclear program. “There has already been great death and destruction,” Trump said, “but there is still time to make this slaughter… come to an end.”","Gordon Chang, senior fellow at the Gatestone Institute, says China's Middle East policy is in disarray.

The latest escalation has sparked growing international concern, with fears mounting that the Middle East may be on the brink of a wider conflict.In statements released late on Saturday, China’s foreign ministry outlined Wang’s conversations with the two countries’ foreign ministers.Speaking first with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, Wang assured him that China “supports Iran in safeguarding its national sovereignty, defending its legitimate rights and interests, and ensuring the safety of its people”.China has long-standing economic and strategic ties with Iran, it is Tehran’s largest trading partner and a major buyer of its oil, even as the country remains under heavy US sanctions.Wang criticised Israel’s actions, saying they “seriously violate... the basic norms governing international relations”. Referring to the strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities, he warned that such attacks “have set a dangerous precedent with potentially catastrophic consequences”.In a follow-up call with Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar, Wang said China “clearly opposes Israel’s violation of international law by attacking Iran with force”, describing the move as “unacceptable”.He also relayed the contents of his earlier conversation with Araghchi to Saar and underlined the need for diplomacy over military action.“Diplomatic means for the Iranian nuclear issue have not been exhausted and there is still hope for a peaceful solution. Force cannot bring lasting peace,” Wang was quoted as saying by AFP.Wang added that China is ready to play “a constructive role” in easing tensions and preventing further escalation.","China’s top diplomat Wang Yi held phone calls with his Iranian and Israeli counterparts on Saturday.

A Major Step Toward Integrating Urban Air Mobility



The EHang EH216‑S: A Glimpse Into the Future of Air Travel



A Bright Future for Air Mobility in Abu Dhabi







Abu Dhabi has made significant strides in air mobility, showcasing its forward-thinking vision for the future with the successful public demonstration of an autonomous flying taxi test flight. The test, a milestone in the development of urban air mobility, was held in the heart of the capital and captured on video for public viewing. The 50-second video clip, released by the Abu Dhabi Investment Office (ADIO) on Friday, presents the flying taxi soaring above the Abu Dhabi Marina, offering a glimpse into the future of transportation.The autonomous flying taxi, a fully electric, driverless vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, took off from the helipad at the Abu Dhabi Cruise Terminal. While the exact duration of the flight wasn’t disclosed, ADIO emphasized that the test flight aimed to assess the efficiency and operational capabilities of these futuristic vehicles in real-world conditions.The flight, which was conducted in partnership with the Smart and Autonomous Systems Council (SASC), ADIO, Chinese technology firm EHang, and Multi Level Group (MLG), is seen as a pivotal step toward making urban air mobility a part of everyday life.ADIO highlighted that the test flight served as a platform for validating key technologies necessary for the successful operation of flying taxis, including hot-weather performance specific to Abu Dhabi’s extreme climate, airspace coordination, and route planning.“Conducted under the oversight of the UAE’s General Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA), the flight provided live proof of the regulatory, operational and infrastructure frameworks essential for safely scaling this new mode of transport,” ADIO said in a statement.Badr Al Olama, Director-General at ADIO, emphasized the importance of the project, stating, ""We are proving that urban air taxis will be a part of everyday life, here in Abu Dhabi and around the world. This is how we diversify our economy, cultivate homegrown capabilities and make the emirate a global leader in next-generation transport.""The flying taxi used in the demonstration was the EHang EH216-S, a two-seater, fully autonomous eVTOL aircraft that is being hailed as the world’s first certified, pilotless flying taxi. The aircraft features a unique design with eight arms equipped with 16 propellers, each powered by a dual-motor system. This design results in a total of 32 independent electric motors that contribute to the aircraft’s efficient vertical take-off and landing capabilities.One of the key features of the EH216-S is its redundancy systems, which ensure that even if one motor or system fails, backup systems will immediately take over, ensuring safety and operational continuity. EHang claims that this high level of redundancy is essential for enhancing the operational safety of the flying taxi.According to ADIO, the flying taxi is specifically designed for urban environments, ideal for short-distance connections, sightseeing, and tourism. With no need for traditional runways, and operating with minimal noise, the EH216-S aligns perfectly with the vision for future cities, where compact and efficient modes of transportation will be essential.EHang’s plans for the future in Abu Dhabi extend beyond just showcasing flying taxis. The Chinese company has confirmed its intention to establish regional operations in the emirate, including a final assembly line and support facilities. This development aligns with Abu Dhabi’s ambitions to be at the forefront of next-generation transportation technologies.""Abu Dhabi continues to be a hub for innovation and the next frontier in air mobility,"" said ADIO, highlighting the long-term vision for the city’s transportation ecosystem. The integration of urban air mobility could dramatically change how people travel within the city, offering faster, more sustainable alternatives to traditional forms of transportation.The successful test flight also signals a broader trend toward autonomous air transport in the UAE, with the emirate striving to lead in the development of these cutting-edge technologies. The project also underscores Abu Dhabi’s ongoing commitment to diversifying its economy by fostering homegrown innovations in high-tech industries.","Abu Dhabi has completed a successful public demonstration of an autonomous flying taxi test flight.

Who is Blasie Metreweli?

Poll Do you believe that having a woman lead MI6 will bring a positive change to the agency? Yes, it's time for diversity in leadership. No, it should be based on merit alone.

Why UK decided to change MI6 leadership now?





UK's foreign intelligence service MI6 to be led by its first woman intelligence officer, Blaise Metreweli.UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Sunday announced the appointment of Blaise Metreweli as the 18th head of MI6, also known as the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS). She is set to assume the role in the autumn this year, succeeding Richard Moore, who has been holding this position for five years.A Cambridge University alumna, Metreweli,49 has had a distinguished career in intelligence services since 1999, when she first joined SIS. Metrerweli currently heads MI6's technology and innovation efforts, a role that mirrors the fictional 'M' character from the James Bond franchise, famously portrayed by Judi Dench.She has previously held senior positions in both MI6 and MI5, the UK’s domestic intelligence service. Her work has focused on assignments in the Middle East and Europe, according to the official statement.Blaise Metreweli expresses her gratitude regarding her appointment as the head of MI6. ""It is both a privilege and an honor to be chosen to lead my Service.""While MI5 first appointed a female chief more than three decades ago — Stella Rimington in 1992, MI6 had not had a woman at its head until now.GCHQ, another arm of the UK’s intelligence services, named its first female director, Anne Keast-Butler, in 2023.“The historic appointment of Blaise Metreweli comes at a time when the work of our intelligence services has never been more vital,” Starmer said in a statement released by Downing Street. “The United Kingdom is facing threats on an unprecedented scale — be it aggressors who send their spy ships to our waters or hackers whose sophisticated cyber plots seek to disrupt our public services.”","UK's foreign intelligence service MI6 to be led by its first woman intelligence officer, Blaise Metreweli.

Political Pressure Closes In



Starmer Responds



Why a Statutory Inquiry Matters

Demand the release of classified documents and internal reports;

Take testimony from survivors in private or public;

Recommend structural reforms for law enforcement, social services, and public communication.

For many survivors, this is the first time they feel their voices might lead to actual accountability.

What Happens Next



Musk’s involvement, while controversial, showed how digital platforms can force action on long-ignored issues.

Starmer’s government is now under pressure to implement swift reforms and offer compensation to survivors.

The political debate has sharpened, with opposition parties vowing to make grooming gangs a central issue in the next election.

Final Word







After years of public outcry, multiple local reviews, and political hesitation, the UK government has announced a full national statutory inquiry into grooming gangs and institutional failures that enabled decades of child sexual exploitation.The decision, announced by Prime Minister Keir Starmer on June 14, marks a dramatic shift in tone for his administration—one that had previously resisted demands for a public investigation into what many see as one of Britain’s worst safeguarding scandals.The tipping point? A perfect storm of political pressure, survivor testimony, community backlash—and unusually, a global spotlight powered by Elon Musk , who used his platform, X (formerly Twitter), to repeatedly target Starmer’s record on grooming gangs.The term “grooming gangs” refers to loosely organised groups of men who exploited underage girls—typically white, working-class, and often in care—in towns across northern England from the early 1990s onwards.The 2014 Jay Report on Rotherham, commissioned after investigative journalism exposed widespread abuse, identified over 1,400 victims between 1997 and 2013. Similar patterns were later uncovered in Rochdale, Telford, Oxford, and Oldham.What made the cases especially sensitive was the ethnic background of many offenders—in several high-profile cases, the perpetrators were men of Pakistani Muslim heritage. However, the official framing used the broader term “Asian grooming gangs”—a euphemism that triggered resentment among British Indians, Sikhs, and East Asians who said their communities were being unfairly implicated.British-Indian communities, especially Hindus and Sikhs, have long objected to the blanket use of the term “Asian grooming gangs.” Their frustration boiled over in January this year when Starmer, in response to criticism from Elon Musk, once again used the phrase during a televised interview.Community leaders issued sharp statements denouncing what they called an ethnic smear. “Why should we be classified as part of these gangs?” asked Jay Shah, spokesperson for Friends of India Society International UK. “Asian means Vietnamese, Sri Lankan, Japanese, Indian, etc. When it comes to grooming gangs, we are Asian. When it comes to Kashmir, we are Indian.”The Hindu Council UK called Starmer’s wording a “whitewash of heinous atrocities,” noting that Hindu and Sikh girls had also been among the victims. Sikh Youth UK, which has documented grooming cases involving Sikh victims for over 15 years, said it had worked with thousands of families and even caught perpetrators outside Sikh schools. The Network of Sikh Organisations described Starmer’s comments as “extremely disappointing” and accused politicians of “protecting perpetrators rather than victims.”Both the Hindu Council UK and INSIGHT UK have since backed Conservative calls for a national inquiry—arguing that political correctness has too often silenced honest debate about ethnicity and crime.The turning point came not from Westminster but from Silicon Valley.In early 2025, Elon Musk—whose X platform has grown into a global political amplifier—began posting repeatedly about grooming gangs. Quoting survivor testimonies, reposting historical reporting, and tagging British officials, Musk accused UK authorities of “turning a blind eye to organised rape” and suggested that political leaders, including Starmer, were “cowards unwilling to confront the truth.”One post from March read: “If these were elite London girls being trafficked, the BBC would talk about nothing else. But poor northern girls? The state looked away.”While the tone of Musk’s commentary sparked debate—especially among British politicians who viewed it as inflammatory—it undeniably brought renewed international attention to the issue.By May, Musk’s X account had posted or amplified over 150 messages about grooming gangs, triggering renewed media coverage, a spike in search interest, and thousands of public responses. Hashtags such as #JusticeForRotherham, #GroomingGangsInquiry, and #StarmerFailedUs trended across the UK and US.The growing visibility added fuel to a debate already brewing in Parliament.In January, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper had quietly commissioned Baroness Louise Casey to conduct a “rapid review” into previous investigations—including Oldham and Rochdale—after persistent claims that public officials downplayed or ignored evidence of abuse.Casey’s report, delivered in May, was damning. It found that multiple public bodies “failed in their duty of care” and that in some cases, victims were dismissed or even blamed. Crucially, it called for a full statutory public inquiry with the ability to compel testimony and evidence.Simultaneously, Conservative MPs, Reform UK leaders, and victim advocacy groups demanded action. Former Home Secretary Suella Braverman, a long-time critic of the “Asian gangs” terminology, stated that Starmer had “run out of excuses.” Reform UK leader Nigel Farage called the lack of a national inquiry “a betrayal of Britain’s daughters.”On June 14, Keir Starmer announced the establishment of a judge-led inquiry under the 2005 Inquiries Act, which gives it full legal powers. He said the investigation would “examine past failures, hold institutions to account, and ensure this can never happen again.”Starmer, who previously served as Director of Public Prosecutions, defended his record, pointing to a rise in grooming-related prosecutions during his tenure. But critics argue that his earlier reluctance to endorse a national inquiry allowed the issue to fester—and exposed Labour to accusations of institutional denial.“There is no more denying the scale of failure,” Starmer said at a press conference. “This inquiry is about justice—for survivors, for their families, and for the country.”Unlike previous reviews—many of which lacked transparency and enforcement—this inquiry has legal teeth. It can:The inquiry will take several months to set up, with hearings likely to begin in early 2026. Its findings could reshape the way Britain handles child protection, race relations, and public accountability. But in the short term, it’s already had an impact:This is not just a story of abuse—it’s a story of institutional failure, political caution, and the new ways power is exercised across borders and platforms. Whether the inquiry delivers justice remains to be seen. But for the thousands of girls whose pain was ignored—and for the communities wrongly smeared along the way—this is a reckoning long overdue.","After years of public outcry, multiple local reviews, and political hesitation, the UK government has announced a full national statutory inquiry into grooming gangs.

A statement from Buckingham Palace said it was made “as a mark of respect for the lives lost, the families in mourning and all the communities affected by this awful tragedy.”The crash happened on Thursday, shortly after an Air India flight took off from Ahmedabad, heading for London. The accident claimed the lives of 241 people on board and at least 29 more on the ground. The plane was carrying 169 Indian nationals, 53 Britons, seven Portuguese citizens and one Canadian. Only one person survived.As the head of state of the United Kingdom and head of the Commonwealth – which includes India and Canada – the King’s tribute during such a major public event held added significance.The parade, known as Trooping the Colour, is a traditional military ceremony in central London, full of music and pageantry.It marks the monarch’s official birthday and includes a grand review of troops on Horse Guards Parade near St James’s Park.The royal family members in uniform were seen wearing black armbands throughout the event. The moment of silence took place while the King stood on the dais after he had inspected the troops.This is not the first time such a gesture has been made during Trooping the Colour.

LONDON: Three British Hindu men were asked their ethnicity in a London park and, when they replied they were Indian and Sri Lankan, were viciously beaten up in an unprovoked attack by three older men who appeared to be Muslim, it has emerged.Two of the men suffered blows to the head and were left unconscious; all had to go to Northwick Park Hospital. They have all been left with cuts and bruises and two have been left with facial fractures. Tory MP Bob Blackman raised the case in the House of Commons on Thursday, describing it as “religious hatred.”TOI has now tracked down the sister of one of the men, a British Indian Gujarati Hindu, aged 20, a first-year university student studying radiography. It turns out he had gone to Harrow Recreation Ground with two friends on May 30 to play cricket. The friends are British Hindus of Sri Lankan descent, aged 20 and 21.The three of them went to a shop at 6 pm, walking past a café where a group of around eight people were seated. It appeared to be a Muslim family, with some of the women wearing hijabs. They looked back at their other friends playing cricket when one of the men outside the café got up and confronted the three Hindus and asked them why they were looking at his family, his sister told TOI.They replied that they were not looking at his family and were looking at friends playing cricket. Then a slightly older man from the café group came over and asked: “What is your problem? Why are you talking to my brother?” The three men tried to defuse the situation and the two men seemed to accept their answer.They went back to the park and sat on a bench.Around 30 minutes later, three men from the cafe group, in their mid to late 20s, came over and became very aggressive, asking, “Where are you from? Are you Sri Lankan? Are you Indian?”To which one of the Sri Lankan-origin men replied: ”Yes, we are.”The three men then beat them up relentlessly, punching and kicking them until the British Indian and his friend were left lying unconscious on the ground, the sister said.“My brother was wearing a sacred thread from a mandir on his wrist,” the sister said.One of the attackers was wearing a Moroccan football T-shirt with the number 2 and the word “Hakimi”.Police and ambulances arrived and the British Indian was taken to the hospital. The other two had to make their own way there.“My brother is struggling. He feels as if people are looking at him and is ashamed to step out of the house. He has never been involved in a fight before,” the sister told TOI on Friday.“He has just done his first-year exams and was meant to resume his two-week clinical placement the week after the attack and that has been put on hold.” She also said she was unhappy with how the police investigation was progressing, as two weeks later, they still had not examined CCTV footage.The Met Police told TOI they were called to deal with a “fight” and one man was taken to hospital “with a head injury”. “There is no evidence at this time that this attack was racially motivated.

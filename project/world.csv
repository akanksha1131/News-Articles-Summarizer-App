Twitch ban halts Drututt’s momentum as League of Legends season draws massive attention,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us-streamers/twitch-ban-halts-drututts-momentum-as-league-of-legends-season-draws-massive-attention/articleshow/126460412.cms,"League of Legends streamer Drututt was hit with a seven-day Twitch ban just days after the new season launched. The suspension followed his use of a controversial hashtag, which he says was self-directed humor, not exclusionary. Fans are split over Twitch’s decision, especially as the ban disrupts his momentum during peak interest and a key competitive announcement.

Why the hashtag ban is dividing the League community





Just days into the new season of League of Legends, controversy has once again followed one of its most outspoken creators. Popular streamer Drututt found himself locked out of Twitch at the worst possible moment, right as fans were flooding streams to understand sweeping gameplay changes. The timing could not have been harsher, and the reason behind the ban has sparked fierce debate across the community.This is not unfamiliar territory for Drututt, whose confrontational humor and rule-testing style have often placed him under the platform’s microscope. Still, many viewers argue this latest suspension crossed into overreach. The ban landed shortly after he announced his role in a new competitive roster and while interest in his Challenger-level insights was peaking. For a creator whose content thrives on momentum, even a short absence carries weight.According to Drututt, the seven-day suspension stemmed from his use of the “NOWOMEN” hashtag during a stream. He insists the phrase was not aimed at anyone else but himself, paired with other self-deprecating tags while he played an off-meta ranged champion in the top lane. In his view, the joke centered on League culture and his own reputation, not exclusion or insult.Context has become the core of the argument. Supporters say Twitch failed to consider intent, while critics counter that moderation must prioritize impact over explanation. This clash highlights a larger issue that creators face when humor collides with automated enforcement.The ban also arrives as Drututt prepares for competition in the Northern League of Legends Championship, where his newly announced team, 4 Swines & a Bum, is set to debut. With fellow high-profile streamers involved, visibility matters. A temporary ban may not derail his career, but it does underline how fragile creator momentum can be.When the suspension is lifted, Drututt should come back to his loud and more observable than ever. It is not clear whether Twitch will change its strategy, but the debate on fairness, circumstances, and expression of creators is not diminishing.","League of Legends streamer Drututt was hit with a seven-day Twitch ban just days after the new season launched.

“Good and stable”: Konvy breaks silence after terrifying livestream shooting in New York City,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us-streamers/good-and-stable-konvy-breaks-silence-after-terrifying-livestream-shooting-in-new-york-city/articleshow/126460313.cms,"Konvy spoke out after a frightening livestream shooting in New York City where six shots struck a vehicle he was in. Konvy was unharmed, but a friend was grazed and hospitalized before being declared stable. Fellow streamer Adin Ross confirmed the incident was real as Konvy later thanked supporters and expressed gratitude for everyone’s safety.

Konvy thanks God as friend recovers after shooting





An almost tragic live stream in New York City caused a shock to the online streaming community. What started as light entertainment, soon turned into a real life threat where shots were fired as the cameras continued to roll. The event shocked the audiences and brought new questions on security as producers keep losing the distinction between real life and live shows.For Konvy, the scare was deeply personal. The 22 year old streamer, whose real name is Steven Garcia, was inside a vehicle with friends when shots rang out in the Bronx. While he escaped unharmed, the gravity of the moment lingered long after the stream ended. Six bullets reportedly struck the vehicle, forcing everyone inside to duck for cover in seconds that felt far longer.The situation drew immediate attention from Adin Ross, who contacted Konvy during his own livestream. Ross made it clear that the incident was real and serious, telling his audience, “It got confirmed to me that it's real...I made sure to know it was real. It's a real situation, it's not no bullshit, it's not no fake shit, it's not no fucking script shit. This is real.”One of the passengers who sat next to Konvy, a man named JJ was wounded in the shooting and was subjected to hospital. The following day, Konvy provided an emotional update on X that shifted the priorities on fear to gratitude. He wrote, “I wanna thank God for keeping us protected thru out the whole situation my friend got grazed but he is good and stable 🙏🏼. I appreciate all the people checking up im tryna get back to everyone ❤️”The message resonated quickly. Fans flooded social media with support, leaving well wishes on JJ’s Instagram page and praising Konvy for speaking openly during a difficult moment.JJ did not personally comment on the incident, but the update provided some relief to the followers who were able to observe the events in real time.Other than the immediate shock, the shooting has provided a new impetus to the debate on the dangers streamers expose themselves to when they stream live in publicly accessible areas. In the case of Konvy, it seems that the experience has enhanced his sense of perspective. It was not a bravado that was in his words, but thanksgiving. In a digital world often driven by spectacle, this moment cut through with raw reality.Also Read: Did someone get shot during Konvy’s livestream?

Twitch viewbotting controversy grows as Asmongold and Hasan Piker trade claims using live stream analytics numbers online,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us-streamers/twitch-viewbotting-controversy-grows-as-asmongold-and-hasan-piker-trade-claims-using-live-stream-analytics-numbers-online/articleshow/126460319.cms,"Twitch viewbotting controversy grows as Asmongold and Hasan Piker trade claims using live stream analytics numbers online (Image via Getty)

Asmongold and Hasan Piker dispute grows after Twitch analytics stream and X exchanges







Zack Hoyt, known online as Asmongold, found himself at the center of new viewbotting talk this week. The issue started during a live Twitch stream on January 9, 2026. Another popular streamer, Hasan Piker, also known as HasanAbi, reacted after Asmongold opened analytics pages on stream. The moment quickly spread across Twitch and social media. Viewbotting means fake viewers or followers are added to a channel. It is a serious claim because it questions how real a creator’s audience is.Both streamers denied doing anything wrong. They also said third parties can send fake followers without permission. What made this story bigger was how both creators accused each other of hypocrisy. The discussion did not stay on Twitch. It moved to X, where screenshots, numbers, and old claims were shared. Here is a clear and simple look at what happened, why it matters, and what each side said.During his January 9 stream, Zack Hoyt opened Hasan Piker’s public analytics on TwitchTracker. While looking at the follower graph, Asmongold said, “I will see if he is doing it today or not.” The chart showed a fast rise in followers soon after Hasan started streaming.Asmongold reacted with confusion and sarcasm, saying, “What is this show? I am confused by what I am seeing.”Hasan Piker replied on his own stream and said the growth was not his doing. He explained that fake followers often get added without warning. Hasan said, “I get follower botted often. That is something I cannot control.”Right after that, Asmongold made his position clear. He said he was not blaming Hasan for the spike. He explained that outside groups can cause these jumps. However, he also said it felt unfair to be accused often. Asmongold said, “I am not holding Hasan responsible. But it feels wrong to accuse me again when this also happens to his channel.”Later, Hasan questioned Asmongold’s numbers. He compared subscriber counts, viewers, and chat activity. Hasan said, “He has around 7,000 subscribers with about 61,000 viewers. I have more subscribers with fewer viewers. You can also look at active chatters.”The argument then moved to X. Hasan claimed that after Twitch removed bots in August 2025, Asmongold’s views dropped. For context, Twitch did confirm a large bot cleanup last year, which affected many channels.Asmongold replied by sharing his own TwitchTracker data. He said the claims were wrong and posted, “This information is false.” Hasan answered again, saying Asmongold’s numbers still looked unusual. Asmongold ended the exchange by posting a photo of a smiling seal.Around the same time, several streamers said their channels were affected by bot activity, showing this problem is not limited to one creator.Also Read: Twitch Streamer Zack “Asmongold” Sparks Backlash After Defending ICE Officer In Minneapolis Shooting Incident, Elon Musk Reacts","Zack Hoyt, known online as Asmongold, found himself at the center of new viewbotting talk.

“Charlie wasn't dumb”: Candace Owens feud reignites as Alex Stone defends Erika Kirk and draws moral line,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us-streamers/charlie-wasnt-dumb-candace-owens-feud-reignites-as-alex-stone-defends-erika-kirk-and-draws-moral-line/articleshow/126460291.cms,"Candace Owens reignited controversy surrounding Charlie Kirk’s murder by again questioning the account of his widow, Erika Kirk. Her remarks prompted a sharp public response from Alex Stone, who defended Erika Kirk and criticized conspiracy driven speculation within conservative circles.

Candace Owens’ SHOCKING Declaration After 4.5-Hour Meeting With Charlie Kirk’s Widow Erika | Watch

Alex Stone calls out Candace Owens theorists amid renewed Charlie Kirk controversy





The fragile calm surrounding one of America’s most polarizing conservative debates has cracked again. One social media comment sparked an old embroiled battle, and caused faith, trust, and loyalty to become the subject of discussion. With the speculation revitalized about the death of Charlie Kirk, there are now public clashes within the conservative movement as to where doubt turns into disrespect.The center of the new tension is Alex Stone whose uncouth message brought a tough line to defend Erika Kirk.His words were aimed squarely at critics fueling conspiracy theories, particularly those aligned with Candace Owens, after she once again questioned Erika Kirk’s account of events tied to her late husband.Stone wrote, “If you are saying that you don't trust Erika Kirk, you are also saying that you don't trust Charlie Kirk. Charlie wasn't dumb. He wasn't naive. He married her and he trusted her. All of these Candace Owens conspiracy theorists should put their phones down and pick up a Bible.”The statement spread quickly, framing the debate as more than a factual dispute. It became a moral challenge.Owens recently revisited doubts about Erika Kirk’s alibi from September 8, just days before Charlie Kirk was shot and killed.Her comments followed what had been described as a ceasefire between the two women after a private meeting late last year. That truce now appears broken.Owens argued that unanswered gaps still linger, including questions about communications and timelines. Erika Kirk, who now leads Turning Point USA, has urged commentators to stop public speculation, warning it could influence the jury in the ongoing case against the accused shooter.Stone’s response reflects a broader frustration within conservative circles. Many see the theories as harmful, not only to a grieving family but to a movement already fractured by internal distrust. Some people say that it is important to be scrutinized even when it is not comfortable.What is very evident is that the rift has ceased to be silent. As the powerful mouths take their sides, the evidence discourse has taken a back seat to ethics. And to a movement that is founded on togetherness and belief, that division can be as difficult to mend as any virtual fight.Also Read: Clavicular accuses Candace Owens’ manager of demanding $30K a month to “PR train” him","Candace Owens reignited controversy surrounding Charlie Kirk’s murder by again questioning the account of his widow, Erika Kirk.

Dan Illouz responds to Candace Owens as supporters push back on Israel Likud remarks





Candace Owens made a strong claim this week that Israel’s ruling Likud party named her and Tucker Carlson as enemies. Her comments came after a speech by Dan Illouz in Israel’s parliament, the Knesset. Candace Owens shared an article from Washington Jewish Week on X and reacted strongly. She wrote, “The Likud party in Israel just named me and Tucker Carlson as enemies that must be fought.” She later added, “These people are murderers. Murderers are threatening me and Tucker Carlson over speech.”Owens also questioned the role of the United States government. She asked, “How is this at all acceptable to our government?” Her post quickly spread online and drew heavy reaction from both supporters and critics.The speech that triggered the backlash happened on Monday. During his address, Illouz warned about what he called harmful ideas coming from the West. He said, “We are used to enemies from outside. We fight terror tunnels of Hamas. We fight the ballistic missiles of Iran. But today I look at the West, our greatest ally, and I see a new enemy rising from within.” He continued, “I am speaking of a poison being sold to the American people as patriotism.I’m speaking of the intellectual vandalism of Tucker Carlson and Candace Owens.”After Owens shared the article, many of her supporters spoke out online. One user asked, “Why are Israeli politicians labeling lawful American citizens who exercise their First Amendment rights as enemies of the state of Israel? Since when did American patriotism become ‘poison’?”Soon after, Dan Illouz responded directly to Owens on X. He wrote, “A quick civics lesson for RealCandaceO: In a democracy, a Member of Parliament speaking is a debate, not ‘the Party.’ This is the freedom America gifted the world.”Illouz also pushed back on the idea that his words were a threat. He said, “This is a civilizational battle of ideas. Any insinuation of violence is just a desperate silencing tactic.” He added that he would respond with “truth and stronger arguments.”The exchange comes as both Candace Owens and Carlson face criticism over past content. Carlson previously hosted Nick Fuentes, a far-right activist known for antisemitic views. Owens has also made sharp comments about Israel in recent months.After the killing of Charlie Kirk, Candace Owens suggested foreign involvement but did not provide proof. The debate remains focused on speech, politics, and rising tension between public figures across countries.Also Read: Candace Owens Raises New Questions About Charlie Kirk After Revealing A Never Before Seen Image With No Visible Blood","Candace Owens made a strong claim this week that Israel’s ruling Likud party named her and Tucker Carlson as enemies.

Minea Pagni and Massimo explain how their relationship began and why they ignore online hate





Minea Pagni is speaking out after her love story took over social media and sparked loud debate online. The 22-year-old Italian influencer went viral after sharing posts about her marriage to her former high school teacher, Massimo, who is nearly 40 years older than her. The couple’s age gap shocked many people online. Some users accused Pagni of marrying for money. Others questioned how the relationship began. As the videos crossed millions of views, the comments turned harsh.Now, Pagni is answering back. In an interview with The New York Post, she made it clear that money had nothing to do with her decision. She said she married for love, respect, and shared values.“I married him for who he is, his mind, his values, and the way he loves,” Pagni told The New York Post. She also said she knew not everyone would agree, but she did not expect the reaction to be so strong. Despite the noise, Pagni says she stands by her choice and wants people to hear her side of the story.Pagni first met Massimo five years ago when he was her high school philosophy teacher. She shared on her Instagram account @diaryofminea that she had a small crush back then, but nothing ever happened.“I had a crush on him. Nothing ever happened,” she wrote. “Years later, we met again, as two adults, and that’s when love actually began.”The two ran into each other at a bookstore two years ago. They started talking, then dating. Last month, they got married. One video, posted around Christmas, showed the couple together and quickly went viral, crossing 16 million views.“Christmas feels a little sweeter this year,” Pagni wrote. “Maybe because I’m spending it with the man I once only dreamed about.”But not everyone was kind. Some comments accused her of chasing money. One user wrote, “Rent cannot be that high sis.”Pagni denied those claims in her interview with The New York Post. “Reducing a woman’s choices to money is one of the oldest and most unfair stereotypes,” she said.Another video, which reached 4 million views, showed old photos of them from 2010. That post also caused backlash. Some viewers even claimed Massimo wore an expensive Rolex watch.“He doesn’t own, wear, or even desire a Rolex,” Pagni told The New York Post. She said the watches he owns are meaningful gifts, not status symbols.Pagni also said her parents had concerns at first. Over time, they saw her happiness and supported her choice. She is now studying medicine and says Massimo fully supports her work and online storytelling.Also Read: Who Is Lifeismizzy?

US role and ongoing mission





The United States carried out “large-scale” retaliatory strikes against Islamic State targets across Syria on Sunday, following last month’s ambush near Palmyra that killed two US soldiers and an American civilian interpreter.US Central Command said the strikes began around 12.30 pm ET and were conducted alongside partner forces, hitting multiple ISIS targets across the country. A US official told CNN that more than 90 precision munitions were fired using more than two dozen aircraft.Saturday’s strikes are part of Operation Hawkeye Strike, the Trump administration’s response to the December attack that killed Sgt. Edgar Brian Torres-Tovar, Sgt. William Nathaniel Howard, and civilian interpreter Ayad Mansoor Sakat while they were supporting Operation Inherent Resolve, the US-led mission to defeat ISIS.US Central Command said the strikes were aimed at preventing future attacks and degrading ISIS’s remaining capabilities in Syria.“The strikes today targeted ISIS throughout Syria as part of our ongoing commitment to root out Islamic terrorism against our warfighters, prevent future attacks, and protect American and partner forces in the region,” the command said in a statement on X.“Our message remains strong: if you harm our warfighters, we will find you and kill you anywhere in the world, no matter how hard you try to evade justice,” US Central Command said.The December ambush marked the first deadly attack on US personnel in Syria since the overthrow of longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad in December 2024. Torres-Tovar, 25, of Des Moines, Iowa, and Howard, 29, of Marshalltown, were members of the Iowa National Guard. Three other Guard members were injured.Operation Hawkeye Strike was launched on December 19 with a large-scale operation that hit roughly 70 ISIS targets across central Syria. The United States and Jordan also carried out a previous round of strikes under the same operation last month.A day before Saturday’s strikes, Syrian officials said their security forces had arrested the military leader of ISIS’s operations in the Levant.Saturday also saw intense clashes in northern Syria’s Aleppo city, where Syrian government forces deployed in the Kurdish-majority Sheikh Maqsoud neighborhood after days of fighting with Kurdish fighters that left dozens dead and wounded.According to Syria’s state news agency SANA, two Kurdish fighters blew themselves up while surrounded by security forces, causing no casualties. Gunfire was reportedly still heard around noon as security forces urged residents to stay indoors. Later in the day, an explosive drone struck the Aleppo Governorate building shortly after a press conference by two Cabinet ministers and a local official.The clashes began Tuesday in Sheikh Maqsoud, Achrafieh, and Bani Zaid after negotiations between the government and the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) stalled over integrating Kurdish forces into the national army. Government forces have since taken control of Achrafieh and Bani Zaid. Five days of fighting killed at least 22 people, including civilians on both sides, according to AP.The United States on Saturday called on the Syrian government and Kurdish authorities to return to negotiations, AFP reported. Conflicting reports emerged from Aleppo, with authorities claiming a halt to fighting and the transfer of Kurdish fighters out of the city, which the Kurdish forces denied.The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces have long been the United States’ main partner against ISIS, but since Assad’s ouster, Washington has increasingly coordinated with Syria’s central government in Damascus. Syria recently joined the global coalition against ISIS.Despite President Donald Trump’s skepticism about US involvement in Syria, hundreds of American troops remain deployed as part of Operation Inherent Resolve. In April, the Pentagon announced plans to cut troop levels in half, and in June US envoy Tom Barrack said the United States would eventually reduce its bases in the country to one.",US Central Command said the strikes began around 12.30 pm ET and were conducted alongside partner forces.

A pair of Minneapolis women were seen following and taunting ICE agents just days after the fatal shooting of protester Renee Nicole Good, according to footage shared across social media.The footage showed unidentified women being confronted by masked ICE agents in the streets, as one agent warned them: ""Don't make a bad decision today.""""If I continually see you following us, interfering with us, honking your horn, blocking our cars, you have a very high probability of making a really bad decision and being arrested today, okay?"" the officer warned one woman in her car.The woman grinned and responded: ""I think I'm making exactly the right decision.""A man nearby then yelled from the street: ""Why are you giving her a warning? She's not interfering, she's just following.""As the ICE agent again told the woman in the car to ""not make a bad decision today and ruin your life"", she chuckled and replied: ""Oh, bad decisions, that's funny coming from you.""As the ICE agent told the woman to ""have a nice day"" she responded: ""I hope you have a terrible day.""The footage received millions of hits when it was shared to X by Fox News reporter Matt Finn, as many on social media criticised the women for antagonising ICE agents so soon after the shooting of Good.In footage shared by Finn, an ICE agent was seen confronting another woman for allegedly following and harassing federal agents. A woman in a blue car was seen holding her car horn as ICE agents passed by on the road, leading the officer to approach her window and point to her.""Just so you know, if we continue to have you follow us..."" he said, while the woman continually held her car horn down to drown him out.The ICE agent continued: ""Okay, have fun, don't make a bad decision today... don't interfere.""The incident came as the fatal shooting of Good on Wednesday in Minneapolis ignited a political firestorm across the US this week, dividing opinion over whether the shooting was justified.President Trump argued that Good was shot after intentionally accelerating her SUV into ICE agent Jon Ross, 43, causing him to shoot her three times in self-defence.The driver of the black Jeep SUV wore a full-face mask, making it impossible to identify him.Ross became the focus of anger over ICE actions around the country after he shot and killed Good on Wednesday afternoon while she was driving her SUV down a street where agents were on duty, Daily Mail reported.The Trump administration came to Ross's defence over his shooting of Good, while Democratic officials in Minneapolis said it was a murder.ICE claimed she deliberately drove her burgundy SUV at agents, but witnesses disputed the claim, with Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey calling it ""bulls**t"".Witnesses said Good and her wife, Rebecca, were acting as legal observers and filming the protest when she was shot, but ICE insisted she tried to use the SUV as a deadly weapon.Footage of the shooting showed Good blocking the road with her car until ICE agents told her to move away. She reversed to head back down the road as an agent tried to open the driver""s side door handle before she drove off. Three shots then rang out.Good lost control of the SUV and slammed it into parked cars and a light pole at high speed, prompting screams from onlookers. Her SUV was seen with a bullet hole through the driver's side windshield.","Two Minneapolis women seen following and taunting ICE agents, according to footage shared across social media.

US President Donald Trump has directed senior special forces commanders to begin preparing ""contingency plans for a possible invasion of Greenland"", reported the Daily Mail on Sunday.The move, however, has reportedly run into resistance from top military officials who are questioning both its legality and political feasibility.According to the report, Trump has asked the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) to draft an invasion plan. However, the proposal is said to be facing pushback from the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who argue that any such operation would be unlawful and lack congressional backing.""The generals think Trump's Greenland plan is crazy and illegal. So they are trying to deflect him with other major military operations. They say it's like dealing with a five-year-old,"" a diplomatic told the Mail.“They have tried to distract Trump by talking about less controversial measures, such as intercepting Russian 'ghost' ships - a clandestine network of hundreds of vessels operated by Moscow to evade Western sanctions - or launching a strike on Iran,” a source told the Mail.Sources familiar with the matter told the Mail that hardline figures within Trump’s inner circle, particularly policy “hawks” led by adviser Stephen Miller, have grown increasingly assertive after what they see as the successful operation to capture Venezuela’s leader Nicolas Maduro.Emboldened by that outcome, they are now pushing for swift action to take control of Greenland before Russia or China is able to expand its influence in the Arctic.Trump’s interest in Greenland may also be driven by domestic political considerations. With mid-term elections approaching later this year, there is concern that the president may seek a dramatic foreign policy move to divert attention from the US economy, amid fears Republicans could lose control of Congress to Democrats,"" the Mail reported, citing British diplomatic sources.Such an action would place Trump on a direct collision course with European leaders and could trigger a profound crisis within the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato), potentially bringing the alliance to breaking point.Diplomatic officials have also reportedly conducted internal war-gaming exercises examining what they describe as an “escalatory scenario,” in which Trump could use military force or sustained political pressure to weaken Greenland’s ties with Denmark.A classified diplomatic cable reportedly outlines a “worst-case” outcome that would result in “the destruction of Nato from the inside.”“Some European officials suspect this is the real aim of the hardline MAGA faction around Trump. Since Congress would not allow Trump to exit Nato, occupying Greenland could force the Europeans to abandon Nato. If Trump wants to end Nato, this might be the most convenient way to do it,” it added.Meanwhile, political parties in Greenland on Saturday issued a joint statement denouncing US President Donald Trump's pressure to seize the Danish autonomous territory.""We don't want to be Americans, we don't want to be Danish, we want to be Greenlanders,"" the leaders of five parties in parliament said.""The future of Greenland must be decided by Greenlanders,"" they added.This came hours after Trump once again spoke about taking action on Greenland, saying the US would have to do “something” or risk Russia and China stepping in. He said Washington does not want Moscow or Beijing as its “neighbours”.""We are going to do something on Greenland, whether they like it or not, because if we don't do it, Russia or China will take over Greenland -- and we're not going to have Russia or China as a neighbour. I would like to make a deal the easy way but if we don't do it the easy way, we're going to do it the hard way,"" Trump said.""And by the way, I'm a fan of Denmark as well. They've been very nice to me. I'm a big fan but the fact that they had a boat land there 500 years ago doesn't mean that they own the land. We had lots of boats go there also. But we need that because if you take a look at outside of Greenland right now, they are Russian destroyers, Chinese destroyers and bigger there are Russian submarines all over the place. We're not going to have Russia or China occupy Greenland and that's what they're going to do if we don't. We will do something with Greenland either the nice way or the difficult way,"" he added.Denmark has also warned that its troops are under orders to “shoot first and ask question later” if Greenland comes under attack, as concerns grow in Europe over the US openly discussing possible military action against the Arctic territory.Earlier, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen rejected Trump’s claims that the US “needs” Greenland for security reasons, calling them an “unacceptable pleasure”.","US President Donald Trump has directed senior special forces commanders to begin preparing ""contingency plans for a possible invasion of Greenland"" The move, however, has reportedly run into resistance from top military officials who are questioning both legality and political feasibility.

Canada Rejects 74% Indian Student Visas In August, Citing Fraud, As Ties With India Hit New Low





The Canada administration is not opening its Parents and Grandparents Program (PGP) in 2026 either and continuing with the halt that it announced in 2025. The agency will process the applications received before 2025 and a maximum of 10,000 applications will be processed. As of now, the program is not open to accepting any new applications. Those who are looking to bring their parents and grandparents to Canada are being advised by immigration experts to opt for a super visa, which will not give parents or grandparents permanent residency in Canada but they can stay for upto five years in Canada, and the visa can be renewed.A few years ago, the administration found that over 40,000 parent and grandparent sponsorship applications were still pending at the end of 2023. The huge backlog has to be cleared first to allow new sponsorships and so the halt was put in place in 2025 and will be continued in 2026 as well.After announcing a halt on new applications on January 1, 2025, the IRCC invited potential sponsors who submitted an interest to sponsor for, in 2020 to apply for the 2025 intake. That process started from July 28, 2025 and ended on October 9, 2025. The IRCC said they sent 17,860 invitations over approximately 2 weeks but they will accept 10,000 complete applications.The program was designed to reunite immigrants in Canada who have become permanent residents, which means only permanent residents in Canada could sponsor their parents and grandparents to enter Canada. This program also allows parents and grandparents to work in Canada and to get provincial healthcare, which the super visa does not.The sponsors of this immigration program are canadian citizens who agree to financially support the sponsored individuals for 20 years, starting from the day the parents or the grandparents become permanent residents.Canada plans to reduce the total number of new permanent residents in Canada by four per cent from last year, stating it will only grant permanent resident status to a total of 380,000 in 2026.","The Canada administration is not opening its Parents and Grandparents Program (PGP) in 2026 either.

Trump Faces Revolt; Protesters Occupy US Streets; Cities Protest ICE Invasion, Deadly Shooting

How protest spread

.





Anger over the killing of a woman by a US immigration agent in Minneapolis spilled onto the streets across US on Saturday. The demonstrations came three days after an ICE agent shot and killed Renee Nicole Good, a US citizen, during an encounter in south Minneapolis.She was sitting in her car when she was shot. Videos of the incident, filmed from different angles, spread quickly online and triggered sharp and emotional reactions across the country.Minnesota state leaders described the shooting as an unjustified use of lethal force against a civilian who was trying to leave the scene. The Trump administration offered a very different version, claiming Ms Good tried to run over the agent. Officials said the agent acted in self-defence.On Saturday, protest groups under the banner “ICE out for good” organised rallies across the country, including in cities that have been key targets of President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown.In Minneapolis, the response was immediate and intense. Protesters marched through immigrant neighbourhoods despite freezing January temperatures, chanting against ICE.Police used tear gas near a federal building close to the airport. Governor Tim Walz condemned the shooting and placed National Guard troops on alert.The White House responded by sending more federal agents to the city. City officials said most protests were peaceful, though 29 people were arrested on Friday night after a smaller group vandalised property and refused to disperse.What began as local outrage soon turned into a national protest movement. Videos of the shooting circulated widely, while civil rights groups and activists issued calls for demonstrations across the country.The anger was further fuelled by the Portland shooting, which many protesters cited as part of a wider pattern involving federal immigration enforcement.By the weekend, protests had spread rapidly. In Portland, demonstrators gathered by the river, holding signs and chanting “Abolish ICE.” In New York, people stood outside ICE offices in the rain. In Los Angeles, a group of protesters gathered near Pershing Square.Similar scenes were reported in Houston, Austin, Boston, Washington DC, Seattle, Omaha, and several smaller towns.In Austin, Democratic lawmaker Greg Casar addressed protesters and called for the removal of Homeland Security secretary Kristi Noem, who has publicly defended the ICE agent involved.“We cannot wait here in despair. We cannot do nothing. We cannot fall into hopelessness. ” Casar told protestors.Minnesota lawmakers Ilhan Omar, Angie Craig and Kelly Morrison also accused ICE of blocking congressional oversight after they were asked to leave an immigration facility shortly after entering it.","Demonstrations came three days after an ICE agent shot and killed Renee Nicole Good, a US citizen, during an encounter in south Minneapolis.

Maduro Seized, Caracas Explodes, Armed Loyalists Mobilise: Venezuelans Warn Trump On Oil Grab

(By arrangement with The American Bazaar)





Donald Trump, the teetotaller president and Commander-in-Chief, who thrives on a diet of Diet Coke and McDonald’ happy meals, was feeling mighty high — drunk on global powers without any limit!At his command, in a brazen daredevil act, the US special forces had seized Venezuelan strongman Nicolás Maduro and his wife and brought them to New York in handcuffs to face justice as a narco-terrorist — international law be damned.Nothing could now stop him from using America’s military might to strike, invade or coerce nations around the world except his “own morality and mind,” he declared grandiosely to the “failing” New York Times in a wide-ranging interview four days later.“Yeah, there is one thing. My own morality. My own mind. It’s the only thing that can stop me,” he told four reporters from ‘the fake news’ media he has accused of seditious behavior for reporting about the 79 years old president’s health and age.“I don’t need international law,” said he trumpeting a new improved ‘Donroe Doctrine,’ a ‘Trump corollary’ of the historic 1823 Monroe Doctrine that brooked no European interference in the American backyard.Trump expected that the US would run Venezuela and extract oil from its huge reserves for years, insisting that the interim government of the country run by Maduro loyalists is “giving us everything that we feel is necessary.”“It wasn’t a hard decision… (to capture Maduro). He killed a lot of people. He sent a lot of bad people into our country,” Trump told Fox News as he talked about appointing a governor, or a viceroy as critics dubbed, to run the virtually occupied nation.Though he did not mention the ousted leader’s other crime — imitating Trump’s signature hip-swaying and stiff arm-waving — as he mockingly told a gathering of congressional Republicans earlier, “He gets up there and he tries to imitate my dance a little bit.”Emboldened by the audacious virtual takeover of Venezuela, Trump eyed even more spoils threatening Colombia with a similar fate, though he did not consider Cuba worth invading because “it’s ready to fall.”But Colombian President Gustavo Petro did win a reprieve and an invitation to visit the White House next month after a placatory call watched by the Times reporters.“I am sure it will work out very well for Colombia, and the U.S.A., but, cocaine and other drugs must be STOPPED from coming into the United States,” Trump warned on Truth Social.Even as Europe drew a red line over Greenland, Trump told the Times he wouldn’t be happy with anything short of “ownership” of Greenland and asked Europe to “shape up” declaring NATO was useless without the United States.Asked whether his actions might provide a precedent in Ukraine or Taiwan, he shrugged off the idea saying President Xi Jinping of China wouldn’t dare attack Taiwan on his watch. “He may do it after we have a different president, but I don’t think he’s going to do it with me as president.”Yet the self-styled “America First,” president of peace was upset at being denied that blasted Nobel by the Norwegian Nobel Committee, despite stopping eight wars including one between nuclear armed India and Pakistan.No worry, the Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado would come calling next week to offer him the prize she won even after being sidelined in favor of Maduro’s vice president Delcy Rodríguez as Venezuela’s new leader.Even as Trump acknowledged some constraints on his power at home, five Republicans who joined Democrats to advance a Senate resolution to limit his power to use military force in Venezuela — a move that’s unlikely to go anywhere — earned his wrath.“Republicans should be ashamed of the senators that just voted with Democrats in attempting to take away our Powers to fight and defend the United States of America,” he wrote on Truth Social demanding they “should never be elected to office again.”Then rewriting history in an Orwellian fashion, he called the January 6, 2021 Capitol riots when scores of Trump supporters broke into the Capitol building in an attempt to overturn the result of the 2020 election that Joe Biden won as a “Day of Love.”The Trump administration marked the five-year anniversary of that day by launching a J6 section on its website describing more than 1,500 convicted people as “peaceful patriotic protesters.”The website goes on to claim that Capitol police escalated “tensions” with “peaceful protesters,” while blaming Democrats for “the real insurrection” of “certifying a fraud-ridden election.”Amid reports that the friendly neighbourhood Supreme Court may for once rule against his favourite weapon tariffs, the White House posted a “THANK YOU, MR. TARIFF!” meme with a sketch of a muscular Trump.Saying “AMERICA IS BACK” a Truth Social post claimed in all caps, “The USA markets just hit another all time high – all of them!!! Thank you Mister Tariff!!!”“Pray that the United States Supreme Court ALLOWS OUR COUNTRY TO CONTINUE ITS UNPRECEDENTED MARCH TOWARD UNPARALLELED GREATNESS! BOTH OUR NATIONAL AND FINANCIAL SECURITY HAVE NEVER BEEN STRONGER!”And the ever helpful apex court obliged deferring its ruling Friday on whether Trump overstepped legal authority by using emergency laws for tariffs to levy sweeping import duties on trade partners, including India, which faces a staggering 500% duty if a new law backed by Trump goes through.Earlier, after the capture of Maduro, White House put out a message with a black and white picture of a stern looking Trump simply saying, “No games. FAFO,” an acronym for “f— around and find out.” or “fool around and find out.”Several Trump supporters posted approving ‘FAFO’ messages with X owner Elon Musk writing “Now for the find out part of FAFO” — sending an ominous message to the world at large that a big bad bully is on the prowl!","“I don’t need international law,” said he trumpeting a new improved ‘Donroe Doctrine,’ a ‘Trump corollary’ of the historic 1823 Monroe Doctrine.

Basket the border collie seems to have a way with words. The 7-year-old dog, who resides on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, knows the names of at least 150 toys—""froggy,"" ""crayon box"" and ""Pop-Tart,"" among them—and can retrieve them on command.Basket built her vocabulary thanks to the dedicated efforts of one of her owners, Elle Baumgartel-Austin. She began the language lessons when Basket was a puppy. ""I would play with her, say the name of the toy—say the name of the toy a lot of times,"" Baumgartel-Austin said. She started with 10 toys, adding more as Basket mastered them.""There never seemed to be a limit,"" she said. ""It's basically like, how many toys could I feasibly store in my tiny apartment?""Now, in a new study, scientists have found that Basket, and other dogs that share her advanced word-learning ability, have a skill that puts them functionally on par with 18-month-old children: They can learn the names of new toys not only through direct instruction but also by eavesdropping on the conversations of their owners.Such sophisticated word learning appears to be rare among dogs, and recognizing the labels for specific objects is a far cry from acquiring language. But the study's findings add to evidence that the cognitive and social abilities that underpin certain kinds of language learning are not limited to humans—and highlight just how adept dogs are at reading human signals.""They're very good at picking up on these cues,"" said Shany Dror, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, and an author of the study.""They're so good that they can pick up on them equally well when the cues are directed to the dog or when they're directed to someone else.""The study, which Dror conducted at Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest, was published in the journal Science on Thursday.Although many dogs can understand simple commands, like ""sit"" or ""stay,"" picking up the names of specific objects -- a skill known as label learning—appears to be a much tougher task. Scientists do not fully understand why.But over the past two decades or so, scientists have identified a handful of outliers, canine prodigies that know the names for dozens or even hundreds of toys and can remember such labels for years. ""They accumulate these huge vocabularies,"" Dror said.Herding dogs—and, in particular, border collies—seem to have a particular knack for this kind of word learning, perhaps because breeders once favored animals that paid especially close attention to what their owners said and did. But even among these breeds, label learning appears to be rare.","Basket, a 7-year-old border collie, knows the names of at least 150 toys.

WASHINGTON: The organisation that oversees the Nobel Peace Prize is throwing cold water on talk of Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado giving her recent award to President Donald Trump Once the Nobel Peace Prize is announced, it can't be revoked, transferred or shared with others, the Norwegian Nobel Institute said in a short statement on Friday.""The decision is final and stands for all time,"" it said.The statement comes after Machado said she'd like to give or share the prize with Trump, who oversaw the successful US operation to capture authoritarian Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro. He is facing drug trafficking charges in New York.""I certainly would love to be able to personally tell him that we believe - the Venezuelan people, because this is a prize of the Venezuelan people - certainly want to, to give it to him and share it with him,"" Machado told Fox News host Sean Hannity on Monday. ""What he has done is historic. It's a huge step towards a democratic transition.""Machado dedicated the prize to Trump, along with the people of Venezuela, shortly after it was announced. Trump has coveted and has openly campaigned for winning the Nobel Prize himself since his return to office.When it comes to governing Venezuela after Maduro's capture, though, Trump has so far backed someone else: acting President Delcy Rodriguez, who served as vice president under Maduro.He's called Machado a ""very nice woman"" but said she doesn't currently have the support within Venezuela to govern. He told Hannity on Thursday that Machado plans to visit next week and referred to a potential Peace Prize offering as a ""great honour"".A representative for Machado did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.","Nobel Peace Prize can't be revoked, transferred or shared with others, the Norwegian Nobel Institute says.

Maduro Seized, Caracas Explodes, Armed Loyalists Mobilise: Venezuelans Warn Trump On Oil Grab





Exxon Mobil has a long history of drilling in challenging environments. The largest U.S. oil company will go almost anywhere to extract hydrocarbons if it can manage the risk and make the numbers work. Exxon pumps crude in the deep water off the coast of Guyana and has invested some $19 billion to produce natural gas on the island nation of Papua New Guinea.But at a highly staged meeting of oil executives called by President Donald Trump at the White House on Friday, Exxon CEO Darren Woods was direct in highlighting the hurdles his company would face in returning to Venezuela, where it has been burned before.""We've had our assets seized there twice, and so you can imagine to reenter a third time would require some pretty significant changes,"" Woods said at the White House meeting, as Susie Wiles, the chief of staff, sat next to him.""Today it's uninvestable,"" he added.Trump summoned the executives to hash out details of his plan to take charge of the Venezuelan oil industry. But the reaction of Woods and other leaders at the event suggested that getting buy-in from the industry for such a costly and potentially risky endeavor might not be as straightforward as the White House had hoped.In the days since U.S. military forces entered Venezuela and captured the country's president, Nicolás Maduro, Trump has asserted that the U.S.will run the country and its oil industry for years. He added that he wanted to use the country's vast oil reserves to drive the price of oil down to $50 per barrel.The president emphasized that he expected the oil companies to foot the bill for the project, and he has a big number in mind.""The plan is for them to spend -- meaning our giant oil companies -- will be spending at least $100 billion of their money, not the government's money,"" Trump told reporters. The government, he said, could provide protection and security.Woods wasn't the only executive at the meeting to appear wary of the plan. At one point, Harold Hamm, an Oklahoma oil tycoon and one of the president's closest allies, offered a carefully calibrated answer that stopped short of endorsing his plan.""It excites me as an explorationist,"" he said. ""Everybody has that in their blood."" But, he added, Venezuela has ""its challenges.""Trump, who was wearing a ""happy Trump"" pin, also had a lively exchange with Ryan Lance, the ConocoPhillips CEO, regarding the $12 billion in claims the company is pursuing against Venezuela. The president, however, showed little interest in addressing such concerns, saying, ""We're not going to look at what people lost in the past."" He jokingly suggested that such losses could be written off on the companies' taxes.""It's already been written off,"" Lance replied somewhat tersely.And after Mark Nelson, the vice chair of Chevron, spoke, Trump made what sounded like a threat.""If we make a deal, you will be there a long time,"" he said, without naming Chevron or any other oil company. ""If we don't make a deal, you won't be there at all.""The meeting succeeded in creating a spectacle. In addition to the executives, the room was crowded with members of the media, including Tucker Carlson, who has been critical of the administration's interventions in Venezuela. (The far-right activist Laura Loomer, in turn, was critical about Carlson's appearance, writing on social media that it was ""terrible optics for the Trump admin in a midterm year."") At one point, Trump paused the discussion to stand up and look out the window at the progress of the White House ballroom being built. (""Wow. What a view."")The number of hard commitments the president was able to extract from the executives was less clear. But Trump appeared confident when talking to reporters after the meeting.""We sort of formed a deal,"" he said.

'Reckless, Ruthless, Outlaw': Trump IMPEACHMENT Bombshell Rocks U.S. House After Venezuela Attack





WASHINGTON: The US economy added over half a million new jobs during President Trump's first year since returning to office, a dramatic slowdown in hiring that underscored the ways in which his agenda may be exacerbating some of the strains facing American workers and employers.The full tally from the labour department, which arrived Friday, showed subdued job growth through the final month of 2025.In truth, the Dec jobs report highlighted a series of harsh realities that may help to explain voters' persistent anxieties. The labour market added about 584,000 jobs over the past 12 months, the slowest pace of job growth since 2020. It was also well below the longer-run average for the United States. Employers created more than 2 million jobs in 2024, the final year under President Biden.The figures released Friday were preliminary, and jobs totals for 2024 and 2025 are expected to be revised down substantially when more complete data is incorporated into the estimates next month.Virtually all of the job growth in Dec - and in 2025 as a whole-occurred in health care, with other sectors, like retail, remaining largely stagnant. And manufacturing, a major focus for Trump, ended 2025 on a dour note, with the industry having lost about 68,000 jobs over the last 12 months on a seasonally adjusted basis.","The US economy added over half a million new jobs during President Trump's first year since returning to office.

British and French Jets Bomb ISIS Weapons Facility North of Palmyra in Joint Air Strike In Syria





US and allied forces carried out large-scale strikes against Islamic State targets across Syria on Saturday, US Central Command (CENTCOM) announced, describing the operation as a direct response to a deadly ISIS attack last month that killed three Americans.CENTCOM said the strikes were carried out around 12.30 pm local time by US forces working alongside partner nations, hitting multiple ISIS targets across the country.The operation was conducted under Operation Hawkeye Strike, which was launched on December 19, 2025, at the direction of President Donald Trump. The campaign followed an ISIS ambush on December 13 in Palmyra, Syria, that targeted US and Syrian forces.The Palmyra attack resulted in the deaths of two American soldiers, Sgt. Edgar Brian Torres-Tovar, 25, of Des Moines, Iowa, and Sgt. William Nathaniel Howard, 29, of Marshalltown, Iowa, as well as civilian interpreter Ayad Mansoor Sakat.Three other Iowa National Guard members were injured. It was the first deadly attack on US personnel in Syria since the overthrow of longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad in December 2024.CENTCOM said in it’s statement: “The strikes today targeted ISIS throughout Syria” and emphasized that the operation was launched “in direct response to the deadly ISIS attack on US and Syrian forces in Palmyra, Syria.”“Our message remains strong: if you harm our warfighters, we will find you and kill you anywhere in the world, no matter how hard you try to evade justice,” the statement added.The military said the strikes reflect an ongoing effort to counter Islamic terrorism, prevent future attacks, and protect US and partner forces in the region. CENTCOM emphasized that US and coalition forces remain determined to pursue those responsible.Operation Hawkeye Strike began on December 19 with a large-scale strike that hit roughly 70 ISIS targets across central Syria. The United States and Jordan also carried out previous strikes under the same operation last month.A day before Saturday’s strikes, Syrian authorities announced the arrest of the military leader responsible for ISIS operations in the Levant.","US Central Command said the strikes were carried out around 12.30 pm local time by US forces working alongside partner nations, hitting multiple ISIS targets across the country.

Iran Captures 200 ‘Israeli-American Terror Organisers’; Trump ‘READY’ for ‘Iranian Mission’ |DETAILS





The Trump administration is reportedly preparing preliminary plans for a possible attack on Iran, including the option of large-scale airstrikes, reported The New York Post, citing the Wall Street Journal.Officials are discussing how to follow through on President Trump’s recent threats against the Islamic Republic, including what sites might be targeted.A massive aerial strike campaign on multiple Iranian military targets is one option being considered, though Washington has not reached consensus on a plan of action. No military equipment or personnel have been moved, and sources emphasised that the planning is routine.President Trump has warned Iran against continuing to kill protesters and indicated that the United States stands ready to act. In a Truth Social post on Saturday (US local time), he wrote: “Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before. The USA stands ready to help!!!”Trump also cautioned Friday: “You better not start shooting because we’ll start shooting too.”The US has previously struck Iranian territory. In June, the United States dropped at least six “bunker buster” bombs on three sites, including Iran’s Fordow nuclear enrichment plant, a deeply fortified facility hidden nearly 300 feet beneath a mountain.The bombing followed threats from Iran to use its nuclear capabilities against Israel during their 12-Day War and was coordinated with Israel’s own attacks on Tehran’s military infrastructure.Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, responded to the United States’ warnings by accusing Trump of having “hands stained with the blood of Iranians.” He told a crowd of supporters Friday: “[The terrorists] are ruining their own streets … in order to please the president of the United States because he said that he would come to their aid. He should pay attention to the state of his own country instead.”Authorities in Iran have tightened their crackdown on nationwide protests, with the death toll rising to at least 65, including 50 protesters. Officials have warned that anyone providing aid to protesters will be considered “enemies of God,” a crime that carries a death penalty. Fears are growing that the true total of deaths may exceed 200.","Officials are discussing how to follow through on President Trump’s recent threats against the Islamic Republic.

US shields Venezuelan oil revenue as Trump signs executive order for investment in the nation’s oil sector,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-shields-venezuelan-oil-revenue-as-trump-signs-executive-order-for-investment-in-the-nations-oil-sector/articleshow/126456570.cms,"Maduro Seized, Caracas Explodes, Armed Loyalists Mobilise: Venezuelans Warn Trump On Oil Grab





US President Donald Trump on Saturday signed an executive order meant to declare a national emergency and safeguard Venezuelan oil revenue held in US accounts, taking another step to control future sales of Venezuelan oil.The executive order effectively blocked the oil revenue from the Latin American country’s creditors and prevented its seizure to satisfy debts or other legal claims, according to a White House fact sheet. The goal was to ensure “these funds are preserved to advance US foreign policy objectives"".The emergency order said the revenue, held in foreign government deposit funds, should be used in Venezuela to help create “peace, prosperity and stability."" The order was signed on Friday, less than a week after US forces captured Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro in Caracas.Several companies had longstanding claims against the country, such as Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips, which left Venezuela nearly 20 years ago after their assets were nationalised under the Maduro regime. Both companies were still owed billions of dollars, according to Reuters.In its fact sheet, the White House said the executive order signed by Trump blocked any attachment, judgment, decree, lien, execution, garnishment, or other judicial process against Foreign Government Deposit Funds, which referred to the Venezuelan oil revenues and diluent sales held in US Treasury accounts.The order prohibited transfers or dealings in these funds except as authorised, superseding any prior Orders that might block or regulate them. It also said the funds were sovereign property of Venezuela held in US custody for governmental and diplomatic purposes, not subject to private claims.The Trump administration sought to prevent the seizure of Venezuelan oil revenue that could undermine critical US efforts to ensure economic and political stability in Venezuela, according to the White House. It said allowing attachment of these funds would directly jeopardise US objectives of halting illegal immigration and drug trafficking.Trump cited the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act and the 1976 National Emergencies Act as a legal justification. A US agreement with Venezuela’s interim leaders would provide up to 50 million barrels of crude oil to Washington, where numerous refineries were specially equipped to refine it.The order was signed on the same day Trump met with executives from Exxon, Conoco, Chevron and other oil companies in Washington to encourage them to invest $100 billion in the Venezuelan oil industry.","US President Donald Trump on Saturday signed an executive order meant to safeguard Venezuelan oil revenue held in US accounts.

'Ross is Christian, conservative,' says father

Is Ross' wife Filipina?





Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer Jonathan Ross fatally shot Renee Nicole Good on a snowy street in south Minneapolis during a confrontation on Wednesday as she tried to drive away, as debate continued over whether his actions were justified.Trump administration figures, including President Donald Trump, defended Ross and claimed that Good was an agitator who attempted to run him over with her SUV. Witnesses told NBC News that it did not appear Ross was in the direct path of Good’s SUV as she tried to evade ICE officers.Ross served in the military and worked for the govt for years before the shooting. As a member of the Indiana National Guard, he was deployed to Iraq from November 2004 to November 2005, NBC news reported.Specialist Ross of the 138th Signal Battalion earned the Army Commendation Medal, the Army Good Conduct Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Medal and the Iraq Campaign Medal, among others, according to the guard.Court documents showed that during his time in Iraq, Ross was a machine gunner on a combat logistical patrol team. After he returned home, Ross joined the US Border Patrol in 2007 in El Paso, Texas, and worked for the agency until 2015 as a field intelligence agent who gathered and analysed information on drug cartels and human traffickers.Ed Ross, 80, defended his son’s decision to shoot Good, in an exclusive interview with the Daily Mail.""'She hit him,' said Ed Ross, 80. 'He also had an officer whose arm was in the car. He will not be charged with anything.'You would never find a nicer, kinder person,' the father added about his son. 'He's a committed, conservative Christian, a tremendous father, a tremendous husband. I couldn't be more proud of him.'""The father, from North Pekin, Illinois, said his son’s wife was a US citizen but declined to say how long she had been in the US. ""'I do not want to go any further than that,' he added.""Neighbors told the Daily Mail that Ross is a hardcore MAGA supporter.His 38-year-old wife, whose doctor parents lived in the Philippines, married him in August 2012, according to posts on her Instagram page. Her first picture with Ross on the social media account was posted two months earlier.In July 2013, when the couple lived around El Paso, Texas, Ross’s wife posted a picture posing next to a US Border Patrol helicopter. She also shared photos of baking recipes from a Spanish-language cookbook.One neighbour at Ross’s 10-house cul-de-sac told the Daily Mail that until recently Ross had been flying pro-Trump flags and a 'Don't Tread On Me' Gadsden Flag, an emblem of the Make America Great Again movement.","Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer Jonathan Ross fatally shot Renee Nicole Good on a snowy street in south Minneapolis during a confrontation on Wednesday.

No IMF Loan In 6 Months? Pakistan Defence Minister’s Jet Export Claim Collapses Under Debt Reality





Pakistan on Saturday claimed that Iraq has expressed “keen interest” in acquiring JF-17 Thunder fighter jets and Super Mushshak training aircraft, following talks between the air chiefs of the two countries.According to a statement issued by the Pakistan Army, air chief marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu, chief of air staff of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF), met lieutenant general staff pilot Mohanad Ghalib Mohammed Radi Al-Asadi, commander of the Iraqi Air Force, during an official visit to Iraq.The discussions focused on enhancing bilateral military cooperation, including joint training, capacity building and operational coordination.“The Iraqi air chief praised PAF’s professionalism and technological advancement, expressed interest in benefiting from PAF’s world-class training and expressed keen interest in JF-17 Thunder fighter jets and Super Mushshak trainer aircraft,” the statement said, as quoted by news agency PTI.Both sides also agreed to pursue joint exercises and training initiatives to strengthen interoperability between the two air forces.The JF-17 Thunder is a single-engine, lightweight combat aircraft jointly developed by China’s Chengdu Aircraft Corporation and the Pakistan Aeronautical Complex.Pakistan has claimed that the aircraft proved its capabilities during last year’s conflict with India, although its effectiveness remains disputed.Pakistan had also deployed Chinese-origin J-10 fighter jets during the May 7–10 hostilities with India.The development comes days after Pakistan and Bangladesh air chiefs held talks on the “potential procurement” of JF-17 jets by Dhaka. However, Bangladesh has not officially confirmed any such plan.Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif recently claimed that the country has seen increased interest in its fighter aircraft following the May 2025 standoff with India. Reports have also suggested that Pakistan is exploring similar defence deals with other countries, including Saudi Arabia, amid ongoing financial pressures.Notably, Pakistan has repeatedly relied on International Monetary Fund support in recent years, with the IMF approving a $7 billion bailout in September 2024 and an additional $1.4 billion loan in May 2025.",Iraq has expressed “keen interest’ in acquiring JF-17 Thunder fighter jets and Super Mushshak training aircraft.

Widespread protests erupted in Pakistan’s Sindh province after a young Hindu farmer was killed by a landlord in Badin.According to a report by Pakistan's news outlet the Nation, Kailash Kolhi was shot dead by an influential landlord, Sarfaraz Nizamani, over the construction of a hut on his land.Following Kolhi’s death, demonstrators staged sit-ins on the Badin–Hyderabad National Highway and the Badin–Thar Coal Road. Hundreds of vehicles remained stranded for hours as protesters demanded justice for the killing of Kolhi and vowed not to disperse until those responsible are arrested.According to a statement shared by activist Shiva Kachhi, the protest has been ongoing without pause.“The protest for the arrest of the killers of the martyred Kailash Kolhi is making history. Shiva Kachhi, Chairman of Pakistan Darawar Ittehad, is leading the historic protest sit-in. This was not just a protest—it was the cry of a wounded conscience. From 10:00 am yesterday until late into the night, the sit-in continued without pause, proving that the demand for justice cannot be silenced,” Kachhi said in a social media post on X.“Men, women, elderly people, and innocent children stayed on the streets with one voice and one demand: justice for Kailash Kolhi.Arrest the killers. Despite exhaustion, hunger, and the cold of the night, the determination of the protesters remained unshaken. Kailash Kolhi’s only ‘crime’ was that he was poor, marginalised, and courageous enough to exist in a system that protects the powerful and crushes the weak. The tears of his children, the grief of his mother, and the silent agony of his widow are today questioning the entire system: Is the blood of the poor so cheap?” he added.Earlier, the victim’s family and community members staged a protest by placing the body at Piru Lashari Stop, where the SSP Badin assured them that the accused would be arrested within 24 hours.The incident occurred four days ago in Raho Kolhi village in the Piru Lashari city area. Despite assurances from district police officials, the main accused has yet to be arrested.The ongoing protest has drawn participation from leaders and workers of several political, nationalist, religious, and social organisations, including Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI), Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), Jiye Sindh Mahaz, Qaumi Awami Tehreek, Jeay Sindh Qaumi Mahaz (Bashir Qureshi group), and Awami Tehreek, The Nation reported.","Kailash Kolhi was shot dead by an influential landlord, Sarfaraz Nizamani, over the construction of a hut on his land.

Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif in a controversial statement has urged the United States and Turkey to “kidnap” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu if they believed in justice and humanity, over the Israel-Gaza conflict.In a televised interview, whose clips have now gone viral on social media, Asif said the US should apprehend Netanyahu “just as Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro was taken away.”He added that Turkey could also seize the Israeli leader, and “Pakistanis are praying for it.”Describing Netanyahu as the “worst criminal of humanity,” Asif claimed that “no atrocities in history match those committed against Palestinians in Gaza.” He added, “No community has done what Israel has done to Palestinians in the last 4,000-5,000 years. He [Netanyahu] is the biggest criminal of humanity. The world has not seen a bigger criminal.”Asif also appeared to raise the issue of penalising those he termed as enablers of such crimes, beginning a sentence with, “And what does the law say about those who support such criminals…” before the show’s anchor, Hamid Mir, interjected and called for a break.Mir warned that Asif’s remarks risked being interpreted as a veiled reference to US President Donald Trump, and indicated that Asif would not remain on air after the break.Pakistan does not have formal diplomatic relations with Israel and has historically expressed strong support for the Palestinian cause. Islamabad also maintains close ties with Iran, another regional critic of Israeli policies.The international criminal court (ICC) has previously issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu in connection with alleged war crimes in Gaza, a legal development referenced during the interview.","Khawaja Asif said the US should apprehend Netanyahu “just as Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro was taken away” He added that Turkey could also seize the Israeli leader, and “Pakistanis are praying for it” Asif also appeared to raise the issue of penalising those he termed as enablers of such crimes.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126438854,imgsize-837064,width-400,resizemode-4/khawaja-asif-file.jpg"
Gen Z uprising in Pakistan?

Is Pakistan heading towards a Gen Z uprising? A PhD student from the country has sparked a debate after critically examining present-day Pakistan, under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and army chief and de facto power centre Asim Munir , without naming either directly.The piece, written through a lens that shows contrast in powerful boomer generation and youth of Gen Z-Alpha, quickly struck a chord online and became a flashpoint for what many described as a quiet rebellion. It highlighted the widening divide between Pakistan’s ruling establishment, often referred to as “Boomers,” and its increasingly restless Gen Z population.The article, titled “It is over,” was written by US-based PhD student Zorain Nizamani and published in Pakistan’s daily The Express Tribune on January 1. It was later taken down, reportedly following pressure from the Pakistani military.“For the older men and women in power, it's over. The young generation isn't buying any of what you're trying to sell to them. No matter how many talks and seminars you arrange in schools and colleges, trying to promote patriotism, it isn't working,” Nizamani wrote.Writing from the perspective of Gen Z and Generation Alpha, Nizamani rejected what he described as an imposed narrative of patriotism pushed by those in power, arguing that such efforts no longer resonate with young Pakistanis.“Young minds, the Gen Z, the alphas, they know exactly what is happening, and despite your consistent efforts of trying to 'sell' your views of patriotism to them, they are seeing right through it. Thanks to the internet, thanks to whatever little education we have left, despite your best efforts of keeping the masses as illiterate as possible, you have failed. You have failed to tell people what to think, they are thinking for themselves. They might be a little too scared to speak their minds because they prefer breathing,” Nizamani wrote.He argued that forced patriotism, speeches and seminars cannot replace justice, opportunity and basic rights, and said young people clearly see corruption, inequality and hypocrisy despite censorship and propaganda.Nizamani also highlighted generational differences over economic freedom, writing, “The Gen Z wants erased restrictions on freelancing, the boomers want to increase regulations on freelancing.”Concluding his article, he wrote: “Boomers, we have had enough. We aren't buying your narrative anymore. It's worn out.”The article drew support from followers of former prime minister Imran Khan, who is currently incarcerated. The Canada wing of Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaaf (PTI) shared the article on X, highlighting its key points.“Zorain Nizamani's article ‘It is Over’ was removed from eTribune most likely for exposing the reality: DG ISPR's university visits are futile. The youth see through propaganda and are no longer easy to mislead or control,” the PTI Canada wing said.Pakistani activist Mehlaqa Samdani also linked the article’s removal to censorship. “Not surprisingly, this article is no longer accessible through the Express Tribune's digital edition, exactly the kind of censorship Zorain talks about,” she wrote.The episode has intensified online debate over whether Pakistan’s younger generation is moving from quiet disillusionment toward open resistance against an entrenched establishment widely seen as out of touch.","US-based PhD student Zorain Nizamani wrote an article on Pakistan's ruling establishment.

No IMF Loan In 6 Months? Pakistan Defence Minister’s Jet Export Claim Collapses Under Debt Reality

Pakistan's repeated reliance on IMF

Bangladesh shows interest in Pak's JF-17

Pak seeks JF-17 deal with Saudi Arabia





Pakistan on Tuesday expressed confidence that it may no longer need financial assistance from the International Monetary Fund within six months, with Pakistan defence minister Khawaja Asif claiming the country had seen a surge in aircraft orders following a four-day military standoff with India in May, Geo TV reported.Speaking on a Geo News programme, Asif made a fanciful claim while arguing that the May 2025 India-Pakistan conflict showcased Pakistan's ""resolve and military effectiveness"" to the world.Military tensions escalated in May 2025 after Pakistan-sponsored terrorists carried out a terror attack in Pahalgam, killing 26 civilians in April. India responded with a strong military operation, launching Operation Sindoor, under which it targeted and destroyed multiple terror camps and Pakistani military facilities.However, Khawaja Asif, appearing disconnected from the ground reality, made such statements after a Bangladeshi defence delegation met Pakistan's air chief to discuss a potential sale of the JF-17 Thunder, the multi-role fighter aircraft jointly developed by China and Pakistan.There are also reports of talks between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia to convert about $2 billion in Saudi loans into a JF-17 fighter jet deal, according to two Pakistani sources cited by Reuters.According to Arab News, several countries have since stepped up defence engagement with Pakistan.“Right now, the number of orders we are receiving after reaching this point is significant because our aircraft have been tested,” defence minister Asif told Pakistan’s Geo News channel.“We are receiving these orders, and it is possible that after six months we may not even need the IMF,” he said.Pakistan markets the Chinese co-developed JF-17 as a lower-cost multi-role fighter and has positioned itself as a supplier offering aircraft, training and maintenance outside Western supply chains.“I am saying this with full confidence,” Asif said. “If all these orders materialise over the next six months, we will not need the IMF.”Pakistan has repeatedly turned to the International Monetary Fund over the years, for financial support to stabilise its fragile economy, with such assistance tied to strict conditions including fiscal reforms, subsidy cuts and revenue-enhancing measures.In September 2024, the IMF approved a $7 billion bailout for Pakistan under its Extended Fund Facility (EFF), followed by a separate $1.4 billion loan under its climate resilience fund in May 2025, aimed at bolstering the country’s economic stability and climate resilience.Demonstrating Dhaka’s efforts to move closer to Islamabad, Bangladesh has expressed “potential interest” in acquiring the JF-17 Thunder fighter aircraft from Pakistan, along with plans to resume direct flights between the two countries from January 29 after a gap of more than a decade.The JF-17, jointly developed by China and Pakistan, was deployed by Pakistan against India during the May 7–10 hostilities. In November last year, Indian Air Force chief Air chief Marshal A P Singh said the aircraft was among at least five high-tech Pakistani fighters shot down during Operation Sindoor.This latest development and closeness between Pakistan and Bangladesh comes under the pretext of Dhaka's straining relations with India.Pakistan and Saudi Arabia are also in talks to convert around $2 billion in Saudi loans into a JF-17 fighter jet deal, as two Pakistani sources told Reuters, in a move that would deepen military cooperation between two Islamic nations. Pakistan and Saudi signed a mutual defence pact last year.The discussions highlight efforts by the long-time allies to operationalise defence cooperation at a time when Pakistan is under acute financial strain and Saudi Arabia is recalibrating its security partnerships amid uncertainty over US commitments in the Middle East.","Pakistani defence minister Khawaja Asif says country may not need IMF help in six months.

Own goal? Pakistan admits political-criminal-terror nexus on its soil; report flags rising violence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/own-goal-pakistan-admits-political-criminal-terror-nexus-on-its-soil-report-flags-rising-violence/articleshow/126374963.cms,"Explained: The Sindhudesh Push In Karachi And The Historical Fractures Driving Pakistan’s Turmoil





Pakistan’s Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry on Tuesday said that nearly 71% of terrorist incidents reported in 2025 originated from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP). He attributed this concentration to a “politically conducive environment and the flourishing political-criminal-terror-nexus which is flourishing there”.Data released by the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) reinforces the scale of the surge. KP recorded the sharpest rise in violence, with “fatalities rose from 1,620 in 2024 to 2,331 in 2025” — a year-on-year increase of more than 40%.The broader national picture is even starker. According to the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS), 2025 was the “deadliest” year in a decade, with 3,387 combat-related deaths. These included 2,115 terrorists, 664 security personnel, 580 civilians and 28 members of pro-government peace committees. PICSS said violence intensified in both “tempo and lethality”, pushing multiple security indicators to their highest levels in years.“Militant attacks climbed to their highest annual total since 2014, and the use of suicide bombings and small drones showed a clear upward trend,” the report said.Suicide attacks rose by 53%, while terrorist incidents overall increased to 1,063 — the highest since 2014.Security forces and civilians also bore rising costs. Security personnel fatalities rose 26% to their highest level since 2011, while civilian deaths increased by 24%, marking the worst toll in a decade. Injuries surged by 53% to 2,263, with sharp rises across all categories.The violence has been most acute in KP and Balochistan. In Bannu alone, Deputy Inspector General Sajjad Khan said 27 police personnel were killed in 134 attacks during 2025. Police carried out 168 intelligence-based operations, arresting 105 militants and killing 65, he said.Pakistan frequently accuses Afghanistan’s Taliban authorities of sheltering the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a militant group blamed for a sharp increase in attacks inside Pakistan since 2021. Afghan officials reject the allegations, insisting they do not permit their territory to be used for attacks against other countries.While the TTP operates independently from Afghanistan’s Taliban, the two groups maintain close ties.Relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan have deteriorated since October, when border clashes followed explosions in Kabul on Oct. 9 that Afghan officials attributed to Pakistan. Although Qatar later helped mediate a ceasefire, talks hosted by Turkey in November failed to produce a lasting agreement.","KP recorded the sharpest rise in violence, with “fatalities rose from 1,620 in 2024 to 2,331 in 2025’ The broader national picture is even starker. 2025 was the “deadliest” year in a decade, with 3,387 combat-related deaths.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126375028,imgsize-1338682,width-400,resizemode-4/photo-credit-ap.jpg"

ISLAMABAD: The polio vaccination campaign in Pakistan's merged districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa fell short of its target, leaving over 935,000 children under five unvaccinated, officials said, citing security challenges and population displacement as key hurdles, The Express Tribune reported.According to The Express Tribune, citing authorities, thousands of families from North and South Waziristan, Bajaur, and other merged districts have migrated to different parts of the country, complicating monitoring and vaccination efforts.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Khyber Pakhtunkhwa reported 19 polio cases in 2025, including four each in North Waziristan, Lakki Marwat, and Tank; three in Bannu; two in Torghar; and one each in Dera Ismail Khan and Lower Kohistan, as reported by The Express Tribune.Officials noted that staffing and operational support for WHO and Unicef programmes in the merged districts were reduced last year, while WHO funding cuts also affected campaign coverage, leaving children in these areas at heightened risk.In Sindh, more than 12,000 children under five were reportedly missed during the final polio drive of 2025 in Hyderabad and surrounding areas, according to The Express Tribune.Refusals were recorded mainly in Cantonment areas and municipal towns such as Hussainabad, Preetabad, Qasimabad, and Tando Jam, with absent households and parental refusals cited as primary reasons.Despite these gaps, the nationwide anti-polio campaign successfully vaccinated more than 44.6 million children across Pakistan, according to The Express Tribune.Punjab led with 22.9 million children vaccinated, followed by Sindh with 10.6 million, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with 7.15 million, and Balochistan with 2.58 million.Officials said contributions from other regions also added to the national tally.Authorities warned that without sustained vaccination efforts, particularly in displaced and high-risk populations, children in the merged districts remain vulnerable to polio, The Express Tribune reported.","Polio vaccination campaign in Pakistan's merged districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa fell short of its target.

Open Letter From Pakistan Backs India As Baloch Leader Signals Diplomatic Break With Islamabad





Baloch leader Mir Yar Baloch has raised a “serious threat” warning over deepening China–Pakistan ties, claiming that China could deploy its military forces in Pakistan’s Balochistan region in the coming months.In an open letter to external affairs minister S Jaishankar, posted on X on New Year’s Day, Mir Yar Baloch said Baloch representatives view the growing strategic partnership between Islamabad and Beijing as “dangerous.”He said Balochistan has “faced decades of repression under Pakistan’s control,” including what he described as “state-sponsored violence” and “human rights abuses.”""The people of Balochistan have endured Pakistan's state occupation, state-sponsored terrorism, and egregious human rights atrocities for the past seventy-nine years. The time has now arrived to eradicate this festering affliction at its roots, ensuring lasting peace and sovereignty for our nation, "" he wrote.In his letter to EAM Jaishankar, Mir Yar Baloch said that China and Pakistan are rapidly moving toward the final stages of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a major Belt and Road Initiative project led by Chinese President Xi Jinping that passes through Balochistan.“The Republic of Balochistan views the escalating strategic alliance between Pakistan and China as profoundly dangerous.We warn that China, in collaboration with Pakistan, has advanced the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) to its final phases,” he said.He warned that unless Baloch resistance and defence forces are strengthened, the region could soon see direct Chinese military involvement.“Should the capabilities of Balochistan's defense and freedom forces not be further bolstered and if they continue to be overlooked as per longstanding patterns, it is conceivable that China could deploy its military forces in Balochistan within a few months,” the letter stated.Mir Yar Baloch also said that any Chinese troop deployment without the approval of the local people could have serious consequences for the region.“The presence of Chinese boots on Balochistani soil without the will of the 60 million Baloch people would pose an unimaginable threat and challenge to the futures of both Bharat and Balochistan,” he wrote.China and Pakistan have repeatedly rejected claims that CPEC has a military angle, saying the project is only economic. India, however, has always opposed CPEC, pointing out that it passes through Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir and affects India’s sovereignty and security.Earlier this year in the Rajya Sabha, minister of state for external affairs Kirti Vardhan Singh repeated India’s stance. In a written reply, he said: “Government's position on CPEC is clear and consistent. Government has consistently protested to parties concerned over the inclusion of the so-called 'China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)', which passes through parts of the Indian Union Territories of Ladakh and Jammu & Kashmir under illegal occupation of Pakistan, as a flagship project of 'OBOR/BRI' and asked them to cease these activities. Any proposed participation of third countries or expansion of the so-called CPEC projects to third countries is unacceptable.”Mir Yar Baloch also praised India’s recent counterterror military actions, highlighting Operation Sindoor, which targeted key terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir after the Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 people.“We commend the bold and resolute actions undertaken by the Modi Government in the previous year through Operation Sindoor, particularly targeting terrorism hubs facilitated by Pakistan and directed against the Pakistani military in response to Pahalgam terror attack. These measures demonstrate exemplary courage and a steadfast commitment to regional security and justice,” he wrote.There has been no official response so far from the Union government, or from Chinese or Pakistani authorities, to Mir Yar Baloch’s claims.",Baloch leader Mir Yar Baloch has raised a “serious threat” warning over deepening China–Pakistan ties.

Why the annual exchange matters



Historical context



Limits of the agreement







NEW DELHI: India and Pakistan on Thursday exchanged, through diplomatic channels, the list of nuclear installations and facilities covered under the Agreement on the Prohibition of Attack against Nuclear Installations and Facilities, the ministry of external affairs said.The exchange took place simultaneously in New Delhi and Islamabad, in keeping with the provisions of the bilateral agreement that governs the protection of nuclear infrastructure in both countries.According to the MEA, the agreement requires India and Pakistan to inform each other of the nuclear installations and facilities covered under the pact on 1 January of every calendar year. Thursday’s exchange marked the 35th consecutive exchange of such lists, with the first taking place on 1 January 1992.The annual exchange has continued uninterrupted for over three decades, even during periods of heightened political and military tension between the two neighbours.The Agreement on the Prohibition of Attack against Nuclear Installations and Facilities was signed on 31 December 1988 and entered into force on 27 January 1991, following the exchange of instruments of ratification by both sides.Under the agreement, both India and Pakistan commit themselves to refrain from undertaking, encouraging or participating in any action aimed at causing destruction of, or damage to, nuclear installations or facilities in the other country.The scope of the agreement is broad. Nuclear installations and facilities covered under the pact include nuclear power plants, research reactors, fuel fabrication units, uranium enrichment facilities, isotope separation plants, reprocessing units and sites storing significant quantities of radioactive material, whether fresh or irradiated.The agreement also specifies that both countries must exchange information on the locations of these facilities, typically in the form of latitude and longitude coordinates, once every year.The annual exchange of lists is designed to reduce the risk of accidental, miscalculated or deliberate attacks on sensitive nuclear infrastructure during periods of conflict or crisis.By formally identifying protected sites, the agreement seeks to prevent scenarios in which conventional military operations could inadvertently escalate into a nuclear crisis. An attack on a nuclear installation, even with conventional weapons, could have catastrophic humanitarian, environmental and strategic consequences.Security analysts view the exchange as a confidence-building measure that helps maintain a minimum level of predictability between two nuclear-armed neighbours with a long history of conflict.Notably, the exchange has continued even during times of strained relations, including after major crises such as the Kargil conflict, the 2001–02 military standoff, the 2016 Uri attack and the 2019 Pulwama attack and Balakot air strikes.When the agreement was negotiated in the late 1980s, both India and Pakistan were moving steadily towards overt nuclear capability, though neither had yet conducted nuclear tests. Concerns over pre-emptive strikes on nuclear facilities, particularly in the context of regional instability, were central to the discussions.The agreement was one of the earliest formal nuclear confidence-building measures between the two countries and predated their 1998 nuclear tests, after which both openly declared themselves nuclear weapon states.Since entering into force in 1991, the agreement has remained intact despite the absence of progress on broader nuclear arms control or risk-reduction mechanisms in South Asia.While the pact prohibits attacks on nuclear installations and facilities, it does not restrict the development, deployment or use of nuclear weapons themselves. Nor does it include verification mechanisms beyond the annual exchange of lists.The agreement also does not cover missile bases, command and control centres or other strategic military assets linked to nuclear weapons.Even so, diplomats and experts argue that the continued observance of the agreement reflects a shared recognition of the dangers posed by attacks on nuclear infrastructure.More than three decades after it came into force, the agreement remains one of the few enduring pillars of nuclear risk reduction between India and Pakistan.In an environment marked by limited dialogue and recurring tensions, the uninterrupted annual exchange of nuclear installation lists serves as a reminder that both sides continue to acknowledge the need to prevent catastrophic escalation.For now, the routine exchange remains a rare example of sustained institutional cooperation between the two countries in the nuclear domain.","India and Pakistan exchange list of nuclear installations and facilities covered under the Agreement on the Prohibition of Attack against Nuclear Installations and Facilities.

ISLAMABAD: Traders across Pakistan have threatened a nationwide shutdown on January 16 if the government does not withdraw its decision to make the installation of Point of Sale (POS) machines mandatory, warning that the move would further burden small businesses and open new avenues for harassment by tax officials, as reported by Dawn.According to Dawn, the warning came during a protest rally held in Islamabad, where traders attempted to march from Aabpara Chowk towards the Red Zone to demonstrate against the Federal Board of Revenue's (FBR) directive.However, heavy police deployment stopped the procession near the Serena Hotel, forcing demonstrators to hold a sit-in at the spot.The protest was organised by the All Pakistan Anjuman-i-Tajran in collaboration with the Traders Action Committee and drew participation from shopkeepers and market representatives from Islamabad and Rawalpindi.Leaders of various trader bodies addressed the gathering, accusing the government of targeting small businesses instead of addressing large-scale corruption.Addressing the crowd, Ajmal Baloch, president of the Traders Action Committee in Islamabad, described the compulsory installation of POS machines as a ""black law"" designed to intimidate traders rather than reform the tax system.He claimed that under the guise of documentation, traders would be exposed to greater harassment and bribery demands by tax officials.Citing an International Monetary Fund assessment, Baloch alleged that corruption in Pakistan amounts to nearly PKR 53 trillion annually, with the FBR accounting for a major share.He accused the department of selectively targeting small shopkeepers while ignoring large-scale corruption.He also alleged that many FBR officials own assets beyond their known sources of income and that their families enjoy foreign education and luxurious lifestyles.The protest leaders also highlighted alleged irregularities in customs operations, claiming that consignments of legally imported goods had been seized and partially returned, while the rest allegedly disappeared, as highlighted by Dawn.Warning of tougher action ahead, the traders announced that if the government attempted to forcibly install POS machines or seal shops, they would block a major arterial road in Islamabad and stage a sit-in at Zero Point on January 16.They further threatened a countrywide shutdown strike if their demands were ignored.The protesters appealed to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to intervene and protect traders from what they described as arbitrary and heavy-handed actions by tax authorities, as reported by Dawn.","Traders across Pakistan have threatened a nationwide shutdown on January 16 if the government does not withdraw its decision to make the installation of Point of Sale (POS) machines mandatory.

However, Ghiskori said that the UAE president did not attend the wedding.Pakistan’s security and foreign policy under Munir remains critical.

Pakistan's former spy chief Faiz Hameed challenged his conviction by a military court which had sentenced him to 14 years in jail, media reports said on Monday.Hameed, the former chief of the powerful Inter-Services Intelligence, was convicted on December 11 by a Field General Court Martial (FGCM) on four counts - engaging in political activities, violating the Official Secrets Act, misusing authority and government resources, and causing wrongful loss to individuals.Hameed's lawyer Mian Ali Ashfaq confirmed that the appeal was filed two days ago, The Express Tribune newspaper reported.A separate application has also been submitted to the Court of Appeal's registrar at General Headquarters Pakistan Army, seeking a copy of the written decision, it said.""The appeal has already been filed,"" Ashfaq said, without disclosing the specific grounds raised in the challenge.Hameed was allowed to appeal against the sentence within 40 days, as given under Section 133-B of the Pakistan Army Act.The appeal will be heard by a Court of Appeals headed by a major general or a senior officer nominated by the army chief, who may uphold, modify or set aside the sentence.Hameed is being held at Special Prison Rawalpindi and has not been shifted to Adiala Jail, the report said.His conviction stems from a 2017 complaint filed by a property developer, who alleged that Hameed, then serving as a major general in the ISI, along with two other officers, raided his residence and business premises, confiscated valuables, and forced him to pay Rs 40 million while also funding a private television channel.The matter resurfaced in 2023 when the Supreme Court directed the property developer to approach the defence ministry, which subsequently instituted a Court of Inquiry in April 2024 to probe the allegations, leading to Hameed's arrest on August 12 that year.The FGCM proceedings commenced on August 12, 2024, and continued for around 15 months before the verdict was announced.Hameed retired from military service in November 2022, became the first former ISI director general to be tried by a military court and convicted.

Pakistan FM Ishaq Dar Admits India Hit Nur Khan Air Base In Operation Sindoor Strikes





Pakistan has once again found itself on the defensive after a senior government official publicly acknowledged the impact of India’s precision strikes on a key military installation during the escalation in May, following Operation Sindoor The admission came from Pakistan’s foreign minister and deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, who, during a year-end press briefing on Saturday, confirmed that India had targeted the Nur Khan Air Base in Rawalpindi’s Chaklala area. Dar acknowledged that the strike caused damage to the military installation and injured personnel stationed there.Addressing reporters, Dar said India had launched multiple drone incursions into Pakistani territory within a short span, underlining the scale of the operation. “They (India) send drones towards Pakistan. In 36 hours, at least 80 drones were sent... We were able to intercept 79 drones out of 80, and only one drone damaged a military installation and personnel were also injured in the attack,” he claimed, according to news agency ANI.Also Read: 'Was advised to take shelter in bunker': Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari's big Op Sindoor admission - watch The foreign minister went on to describe the sequence of events following the strikes, saying that Pakistan’s civil and military leadership, led by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, held an emergency meeting on the night of May 9 to respond to the evolving situation.He added that India “made the mistake” of attacking the Nur Khan Air Base in the early hours of May 10, a remark that further acknowledged the strike and its impact.Dar’s comments amount to a rare public admission by a top Pakistani official of India’s military action on Pakistani air bases in May. The strikes came after Operation Sindoor, launched by the Indian Armed Forces to target nine terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir, in retaliation for the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam that killed 26 civilians.The Pakistan Air Force’s Nur Khan Air Base in Chaklala suffered significant damage during the Indian precision strikes. India had launched Operation Sindoor in the early hours of May 7 as a direct response to the Pahalgam attack.The escalation that followed saw increased cross-border shelling by Pakistan and retaliatory action by Indian forces. The situation later took an unexpected turn when Pakistan’s Director General of Military Operations contacted his Indian counterpart to propose a ceasefire, which India accepted. The outreach from the Pakistani side was later confirmed by Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri, who said both sides agreed to halt all military operations on land, at sea and in the air.Satellite imagery released by Maxar Technologies on May 13 showed significant damage to multiple Pakistani air bases, including Nur Khan Air Base. The images revealed damage at four installations: Nur Khan Air Base in Rawalpindi, PAF Base Mushaf in Sargodha, Bholari Air Base and PAF Base Shahbaz in Jacobabad. A comparison of satellite images taken on April 25 and May 10 showed clear damage to air base facilities, corroborating the strikes.This is not the first time a senior Pakistani leader has acknowledged the attack on Nur Khan Air Base. In May, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif admitted that Indian ballistic missiles had hit the base and other locations, breaking from Pakistan’s usual practice of denying Indian military action.Addressing a ceremony at the Pakistan Monument on May 16, Sharif said, “At around 2:30 am on May 10, General Syed Asim Munir called me on a secure line and informed me that India's ballistic missiles had hit Nur Khan Airbase and other areas.

Operation Sindoor

(With ANI inputs)





NEW DELHI: Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari admitted that he was urged to take shelter in a bunker for his safety during the four-day confrontation with India in May, a remark that underscored India’s prowess to strike deep into mainland Pakistan.According to Zardari, the advice came from his military secretary, though he claimed he refused to take shelter.“I had actually told him (secretary) four days earlier that a war was going to happen. But he came to me and said, ‘Sir, let’s go to the bunkers.’ I replied, ‘If martyrdom is to come, it will come here. Leaders don’t die in bunkers; they die on the battlefield.

Top NATO Ally Blocks U.S Forces From Using Its Bases Against Islamic Republic





Iran has warned the United States of retaliation if subjected to military aggression, saying all US bases and assets in the region would become “legitimate targets” in such a scenario.In a strongly worded letter addressed to the UN secretary general, António Guterres, and members of the security council, Iran accused the United States of issuing unlawful threats of force and urged the Council to act “without delay” to prevent further escalation.While reiterating that it “neither seeks tension nor war” and will not initiate any conflict, Iran made clear that it would respond if attacked.“In the event that it is subjected to military aggression, Iran will respond decisively and proportionately in the exercise of its inherent right of self-defence under Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations,” the letter stated.It added that in such circumstances, “all bases, facilities, and assets of the hostile force in the region would constitute legitimate targets” as part of Iran’s defensive response. Tehran said the United States would bear “full and direct responsibility” for any “unpredictable and uncontrolled consequences.”Iran urged the security council to use its authority and good offices to ensure that the US ""immediately ceases its unlawful threats of the use of force.""Tehran also said it noted that it has engaged “constructively, with seriousness and in good faith” in nuclear talks with the US.The warning to the UN comes against a backdrop of rising military posturing and hardening rhetoric on both sides.On Thursday, Iran conducted its annual military drills with Russia, even as a second US aircraft carrier moved closer to the Middle East — a visible reminder of the growing strategic pressure in the region. The developments have underscored the fragile situation between both Washington and Tehran, as the two nations signal that they are prepared for conflict if nuclear negotiations collapse.US President Donald Trump has repeatedly cautioned Iran that failure to reach a deal would carry consequences. In his latest remarks, he suggested the window for diplomacy may be closing fast, saying he believes 10 to 15 days is “enough time” for Iran to reach an agreement.“It’s proven to be, over the years, not easy to make a meaningful deal with Iran, and we have to make a meaningful deal. Otherwise, bad things happen,” Trump said on Thursday.While there has been no official indication of imminent military action, the convergence of diplomatic deadlines, visible force deployments and escalating rhetoric has kept tensions high, placing US-Iran relations under intense international scrutiny.","Iran has warned the United States of retaliation if subjected to military aggression.

Committed to minority safety and cordial relations with India: Bangladesh lone Hindu minister,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/committed-to-minority-safety-bangladesh-hindu-min/articleshow/128587310.cms,"Bangladesh PM Tarique Rahman Makes BIG Promise To Hindus As India Detains Hindu Cop Killer In Delhi

Most political parties now realise importance of Hindus in Bangladesh’s electoral politics: Culture minister





Nitai Roy Chowdhury, 77, lone Hindu minister in PM Tarique Rahman-led govt and vice-chairman of Bangladesh Nationalist Party’s central committee, said the administration was committed to ensuring the safety of all minorities and restoring cordial relations with India, asserting that fundamentalism would not be allowed to spread in Bangladesh.Chowdhury spoke to TOI in an exclusive interview over the phone after taking oath as culture minister along with 48 other members, including state ministers, in the cabinet headed by Rahman. He was also among the only four candidates from minority communities, all from BNP, who won in the Feb 12 elections.Among the 25 newly elected members of the National Parliament from BNP who took oath as ministers alongside the newly sworn-in PM, Chowdhury won from Magura-2 constituency.He received over 1.4 lakh votes, defeating Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami’s Mustarshid Billah, who secured about 1.2 lakh votes. Referring to the state of governance he inherited, Chowdhury said the previous government led by Sheikh Hasina had left the country’s institutions in tatters.“Almost everything was in disorder,” he said, adding that after being elected to form the new govt, it was their duty to bring the country back on track.He said the BNP did not want to indulge in criticism of the past but aimed to move forward with new hopes and dreams to put Bangladesh on the path of development.Explaining what he meant by institutional damage, Chowdhury alleged that when Hasina fled Bangladesh in 2024, the country was “completely broken”. He claimed the biggest damage was done to the education system, alleging that it had become policy under Awami League to pass 98% of students in exams irrespective of merit. “It was done to falsely show that literacy rate of Bangladesh was increasing along with the passing percentage of students,” he said.He also accused the previous regime of damaging the country’s cultural fabric. During the Awami League govt, he said, “all sorts of obscene dance and music along with hooliganism were encouraged while pushing our actual cultural values on the backburner.” He said the new govt would work to repair these pillars while upholding the ethos of unity in diversity, which he claimed had been ruined.On apprehensions regarding the safety of minorities, particularly Hindus, Chowdhury pointed to what he described as a significant turnout of Hindu voters in the recent elections. He said such turnout was not witnessed in other communities and reflected a shift in political thinking.“Hindus realised that they cannot be treated as mere vote-bank by any party in Bangladesh. They felt that they are an inseparable part of this Bangladesh,” Chowdhury said.He said the PM and other BNP leaders met Hindu voters before the elections to assure them of safety and security. “They realised that they too are independent citizens of this country with equal rights to life and livelihood as mentioned in our constitution. Hence, they voted in large numbers for the BNP, for which we are grateful,” he said.Chowdhury said most political parties had now realised the importance of Hindus in electoral politics, noting that their support was crucial in at least 80 of the total 297 constituencies in parliament. He said that earlier the majority of Hindu voters had supported Awami League, but after its leaders fled, many felt insecure. He credited Rahman with working to remove that fear and win their support.On ties with India, Chowdhury said it was the new administration’s duty to develop good relations with all neighbours, including India. “We want to have ties which have mutual respect, interest, and understanding,” he said. “We will work on issues related to internal security of both Bangladesh and India,” he added.As culture minister, Chowdhury said Bengali culture was rich and that Bangladesh had cultural ties with at least 48 countries, including India. He saidgovt would strengthen these ties by focusing on traditions followed by previous generations while fighting fundamentalism.“We all together will work for a better Bangladesh,” he said.","Chowdhury spoke to TOI in an exclusive interview over the phone after taking oath as culture minister along with 48 other members, including state ministers, in the cabinet headed by Rahman.

Are aliens real? Donald Trump orders release of 'classified information' on UFOs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/are-aliens-real-donald-trump-orders-release-of-classified-information-on-ufos/articleshow/128586040.cms,"Donald Trump (File photo)

‘It’s True But…’: Barack Obama’s First Response After ALIEN Remark Sparks Big Debate | Full Detail





US president Donald Trump on Thursday announced that he's ordering the release of classified files on UFOs and aliens, while accusing former president Barack Obama of releasing classified info.""Based on the tremendous interest shown, I will be directing the Secretary of War, and other relevant Departments and Agencies, to begin the process of identifying and releasing Government files related to alien and extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), and unidentified flying objects (UFOs), and any and all other information connected to these highly complex, but extremely interesting and important, matters. GOD BLESS AMERICA!"" said Trump on TruthSocial.Trump's remarks came hours after he accused former President Barack Obama of disclosing “classified information” over remarks suggesting aliens might be real. Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump said, “I don’t know if they’re real or not,"" and added about Obama, “I may get him out of trouble by declassifying.”Former President Barack Obama, who made the remarks during a podcast appearance over the weekend, later clarified that he had not seen evidence that aliens “have made contact with us.” He added, however, “statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there’s life out there.”Trump also addressed the subject on Thursday, telling reporters: “I don’t have an opinion on it. I never talk about it. A lot of people do. A lot of people believe it.”Trump’s daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, suggested this week that he may weigh in more directly. Speaking on a podcast, she said the president had prepared a speech on aliens that he would deliver at the “right time.”That claim drew an amused response from the White House. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt laughed when asked about it on Wednesday, saying, “A speech on aliens would be news to me.”Public fascination with unidentified flying objects resurfaced after former Pentagon and government officials leaked Navy videos of unknown aerial objects to The New York Times and Politico in 2017. The renewed attention led Congress to hold its first UFO hearings in 50 years in May 2022. Officials later said the objects seen in widely discussed footage, green triangular shapes hovering above a Navy ship, were likely drones.Amid growing scrutiny, the Pentagon pledged greater transparency. In July 2022, it established the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), tasked with centralising reports of unidentified aerial phenomena.In 2023, AARO’s then-director Sean Kirkpatrick said he had found no evidence “of any program having ever existed” to conduct reverse engineering of extraterrestrial technology.Available public data indicates that while many military UFO sightings remain unresolved, identified cases have largely involved routine objects. An 18-page unclassified report submitted to Congress in June 2024 noted 485 reports of unidentified phenomena over the previous year, with 118 attributed to “prosaic objects such as various types of balloons, birds, and unmanned aerial systems.”",US president Donald Trump announced that he's ordering the release of classified files on UFOs and aliens.

toll timings to account for changes in travel demand during the day. Schools and educational institutions modify timetables, typically shortening days and adjusting physical activities for fasting students.

Businesses adapt operations to accommodate prayer times, community events and the distinctive pace of Ramadan.





As the holy month of Ramadan 1447 AH begins across the UAE, workplaces nationwide are adjusting schedules to reflect both the spiritual rhythm of the month and legal labour requirements. Under Cabinet Decision No. 1 of 2022 implementing Federal Decree-Law No. 33 of 2021, private sector working hours are reduced by two hours daily during Ramadan, a statutory right for employees regardless of religion, role or seniority.The rationale behind this adjustment is to support work-life balance, respect the physical demands of fasting, and align business operations with the slower pace of life typical during Ramadan. Traditionally eight- or nine-hour workdays are shortened, often resulting in six-hour days across most private businesses. Employers are also permitted to offer flexible or remote working arrangements within these reduced hours, as long as operational requirements are met and the legal maximum workday is observed.The two-hour reduction applies broadly to private sector employees across the UAE, including non-Muslims, unless specific exemptions apply due to the nature of the work.Roles involving shift-based operations, security, healthcare, hospitality or essential services may operate under alternative arrangements, though they must still respect the maximum working hours stipulated by law and compensate any extra time according to overtime provisions.This legal entitlement is rooted in the UAE Federal Labour Law, which allows the Cabinet to adjust working hours for Ramadan and ensures employees are not overworked during the holy month.Despite the broad legal framework, some workers report discrepancies, such as companies unofficially maintaining longer hours or dividing schedules in ways that appear to undermine the spirit of the rules. These issues have surfaced on social platforms, with some employees expressing concern about inconsistent implementation and noting that overtime should legally apply when the reduced hours are not respected.If an employee is required to work beyond the reduced hours, the extra time is generally classed as overtime, which entitles the employee to additional compensation. According to both the UAE Labour Law and legal experts, overtime during Ramadan must be paid at:Employers may ask workers to work overtime (up to two hours per day), but such work must be voluntary and properly remunerated. These provisions are designed to protect employees while allowing businesses flexibility when demands require it.While most private sector employees are entitled to shorter hours, certain roles and industries aren’t covered by the standard six-hour schedule due to business continuity or operational imperatives. For example:This has led to some debate online, with workers in certain sectors questioning whether exemptions are being applied fairly or consistently, especially when schedules extend beyond the legally mandated reduction.In parallel, federal and emirate government entities have also announced adjusted Ramadan working hours. A circular issued by the Federal Authority for Government Human Resources confirmed that most federal ministries will operate 9:00 am to 2:30 pm from Monday to Thursday and 9:00 am to 12:00 pm on Fridays during Ramadan, with flexibility for remote work on Fridays under specified limits.Several emirates, including Dubai and Ajman, have further embraced flexibility. Dubai’s government has offered options for flexible start times and partial remote work to support employees’ family and spiritual commitments throughout the month.The reduced working hours ripple beyond office schedules:The overarching goal, officials say, is not merely regulatory compliance but fostering a work environment that respects both religious observance and economic productivity, while also safeguarding employee wellbeing. Despite clear legal mandates, some employees have voiced frustration online about employers who do not fully adhere to the reduced hours or who allocate hours unevenly between fasting and non-fasting staff.These workplace disputes sometimes lead to confusion over rights and enforcement, prompting advice from legal consultants to workers to raise issues with MoHRE where necessary. In general, however, reduced work hours are seen as a benefit to workers, offering more time for family, prayer and rest during a physically demanding fasting period, while employers are encouraged to use flexible and remote arrangements where possible to maintain business continuity.Private sector workdays are reduced by two hours daily during Ramadan under UAE law, benefiting all employees unless exempted for specific operational reasons. Overtime beyond the reduced hours is payable at higher rates, with enhanced compensation for night work and weekend shifts. Public sector employees also receive adjusted Ramadan schedules, often with flexible and remote options. Disputes about implementation and exemptions sometimes arise but legal protections exist through MoHRE and federal labour law.","Private sector working hours are reduced by two hours daily during Ramadan, a statutory right for employees regardless of religion, role or seniority.

Youth-targeted programmes that encourage legal literacy and responsible behaviour among teenage drivers





In an assertive bid to curb reckless driving and youth-related offenses, Kuwait i authorities have wrapped up a major nationwide security and traffic safety campaign that resulted in 45 reckless drivers arrested and 19 juveniles referred to legal authorities over recent days. The Ministry of Interior (MoI) led the effort, combining traffic police units, patrols and intelligence resources to enforce road laws more strictly and address growing concerns about public safety on Kuwait’s streets. The campaign reflects a broader strategy to tackle irresponsible behaviour that has been linked to fatalities, property damage and escalating public unease.Authorities underscored that the intensified enforcement was not arbitrary but rather a measured response to statistics and community complaints showing a rise in dangerous driving behaviours, such as excessive speeding, illegal drifting, ignoring traffic signals and other violations that increase the risk of accidents. By focusing on these priorities, the campaign aims to protect both residents and visitors and reinforce respect for the rule of law in one of the Gulf’s busiest urban landscapes.Between coastal highways and urban thoroughfares, traffic officers across all governorates took part in concentrated enforcement efforts that targeted both habitual offenders and spontaneous infractions. According to reports from the Ministry, 45 drivers were detained for recklessness, including cases where drivers performed stunts, engaged in dangerous manoeuvres and blatantly violated traffic rules in ways that threatened other road users.The campaign also saw violations recorded for:By arresting offenders on the spot, police aimed not only to punish unsafe behaviour but also to set a visible deterrent example for others who might consider risky driving a casual indulgence rather than a serious public hazard.Officials emphasised that reckless driving is a leading contributor to traffic accidents in Kuwait and remains a priority enforcement area for the MoI. Through targeted campaigns, authorities hope to drive lasting cultural change and reduce the rate of crash-related injuries and fatalities that have burdened families and emergency services in recent years.In tandem with the traffic crackdown, 19 juveniles were referred to legal authorities over various infractions observed during the campaign. While specific details about each case were not disclosed, juveniles are often referred when implicated in:The referral of juveniles underscores another dimension of the MoI’s strategy, one that recognises the need for responsible legal and social intervention rather than just punitive measures. In many jurisdictions, including Kuwait, juveniles referred to authorities may undergo rehabilitative programs, legal guidance or supervision designed to help them avoid deeper involvement with crime as they mature.Community observers and youth advocates in Kuwait have noted that such referrals, paired with educational initiatives, can be a meaningful way to steer young people away from habits and circles that normalise high-risk behaviour.Kuwait is not alone in grappling with traffic safety challenges. Across the Gulf region, countries have repeatedly cited road accidents and reckless driving as key social concerns. Expatriate and local drivers alike contribute to diverse driving cultures, and authorities have responded with rigorous campaigns, fines, vehicle impounds and awareness programmes.For example:In Kuwait’s case, the recent arrests were all publicly announced and serve a dual purpose: improving safety statistics and signalling to the community that traffic enforcement is a sustained priority, not just a periodic campaign.Road safety is a public health priority. Traffic accidents remain a significant cause of injury and death in many countries and Kuwait has seen its share of serious collisions tied to reckless behaviour. By targeting high-risk drivers, law enforcement hopes to reduce not only violations but accident rates and emergency hospital admissions. Behavioural norms are at stake. Public perceptions matter. When drivers regularly see enforcement in action, especially arrests on the spot, it reinforces a cultural expectation that compliance with traffic laws is non-negotiable, not optional. This can help reduce risky driving over time.Youth involvement signals community concern. That juveniles were among those referred indicates that dangerous behaviour is not confined to adult drivers. Addressing youth conduct early can prevent risk escalation and steer teens and young adults toward safer habits and legal awareness. Enforcement changes public behaviour. Traffic campaigns create visible deterrence, signalling to would-be violators that authorities are actively watching and ready to take action, a dynamic that can be more effective than fines alone.Social media reaction to the campaign has been mixed but generally supportive of stricter enforcement, especially among those who have witnessed reckless driving firsthand. Many users praised the MoI for taking a firm approach, noting that enforcement was long overdue and speeds in Kedah, Hawally and other busy districts often felt out of control.Some commentators also pointed to the need for complementary measures, such as:The interplay between law enforcement and community engagement is increasingly recognised as key to long-term behavioural change. While the recent campaign has made headlines for arrests and juvenile referrals, authorities have indicated that enforcement will be sustained and possibly expanded. Possible future priorities might include:The MoI’s overall message is clear: lawful behaviour and public safety are non-negotiable, and drivers of all ages must respect traffic laws if they wish to avoid legal penalties and contribute to a safer environment for everyone. Kuwait’s nationwide campaign resulted in 45 reckless drivers arrested and 19 juveniles referred for investigation. The crackdown focused on dangerous driving behaviours, traffic violations and youth-linked incidents. Authorities aim to improve public safety, road compliance and cultural norms around driving. The initiative is part of broader regional efforts to address traffic-related fatalities and irresponsible behaviour. Public reaction has been mostly supportive, with calls for complementary education alongside enforcement.","45 reckless drivers arrested and 19 juveniles referred to legal authorities over recent days.

Iran fortifies key facilities



Strategic stakes and regional impact







The United States has deployed the most substantial military force to the Middle East since the 2003 invasion of Iraq, raising fears of imminent strikes against Iran as President Donald Trump weighs his options. Sources familiar with the matter told CNN that the US military could be ready to launch attacks as early as this weekend, although Trump has yet to make a final decision. The president has reportedly polled advisers and foreign leaders, weighing both the risks of military action and the potential gains of further diplomacy.White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt emphasised on Wednesday that while diplomacy remains Trump’s “first option,” military action remains firmly on the table. “There’s many reasons and arguments that one could make for a strike against Iran,” she said, adding that the president relies heavily on counsel from his national security team. Negotiations continue: US and Iranian officials met in Geneva this week for indirect talks, agreeing on a “set of guiding principles,” though key details remain unresolved, CBS reported.The military buildup includes 13 US warships already stationed in the Middle East, including the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, nine destroyers, and three littoral combat ships.A second carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford—the world’s largest—has been ordered from the Caribbean and is expected to arrive within weeks, accompanied by three destroyers.Air power is also surging. Advanced F-22 and F-35 fighter jets, F-15 and F-16 warplanes, and KC-135 aerial refuelling aircraft have been repositioned closer to Iran, with command-and-control planes arriving to coordinate a potential sustained air campaign. Flight-tracking data shows E-3 Sentry airborne warning and control aircraft and other support planes operating in the region, laying the foundation for operations that could extend for weeks, rather than a single strike.“This presence of so much firepower in the region creates a momentum of its own,” said Susan Ziadeh, senior advisor at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “Sometimes that momentum is a little hard to just put the brakes on and say, that’s it, we’re not doing anything.”Meanwhile, Iran has intensified defensive preparations. Satellite imagery analysed by the Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) and reported by Reuters shows the construction of concrete shields over sensitive facilities, including the Taleghan 2 site near Parchin. Tunnel entrances at the Isfahan nuclear complex have been buried in soil, while sites near Natanz are being hardened. Iranian missile bases in Shiraz South and Qom are also being rebuilt after last year’s strikes by Israel.Experts warn that these measures could complicate any US air campaign. “Backfilling the tunnel entrances would help dampen potential airstrikes and make ground access difficult,” said William Goodhind, a forensic imagery analyst with Contested Ground, as reported by Reuters. ISIS founder David Albright noted that Iran’s recent activity “may soon become a fully unrecognisable bunker, providing significant protection from aerial strikes. ”US officials told The Wall Street Journal that President Trump has been briefed on options ranging from limited strikes on nuclear and missile facilities to broader operations targeting regime leaders and regional proxies. Long-range bombers, including B-2s, could be deployed directly from the US or from Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean, as Trump has hinted on social media.Iran, heavily reliant on its missile arsenal and lacking a significant air force, could respond by targeting US bases and allies or attempting to close the Strait of Hormuz. Analysts, including retired Air Force General David Deptula, suggest that the military buildup might itself push Tehran toward concessions: “The dramatic increase in deployed forces may be significant enough that Trump is not messing around with the use of force,” he said.","US has deployed the most substantial military force to the Middle East since the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

Now a resident of Aubrey, she said her family still lives in Frisco and alleged that Indians were manipulating housing systems in Texas communities, preventing people of other races or nationalities from securing apartments.Kelly attributed what she described as demographic shifts in Frisco to steering within the Indian community for “tax benefits,” which she claimed came at the expense of locals “losing jobs.”She stated that she holds a Texas real estate license and previously worked as an assistant property manager for a company operating apartment communities in Frisco and surrounding areas.Describing what she called a pattern of abuse, Kelly alleged that an Indian applicant would qualify for an apartment lease, but on move-in day, a different individual would collect the keys. ""The next thing you know the original leaseholder is back in India and impossible to get a hold of,"" she said.According to her account, the person occupying the apartment would not have undergone the same screening process, which she described as a “fair housing issue.” She further claimed that the practice was occurring at such a scale in Frisco and Plano that it warranted police intervention.""Once an apartment gets into an Indian's hands, it's over,"" she said, alleging that units were circulated within Indian social media groups rather than being returned to property management, ensuring that “another Indian moves in.”""No other race or nationality has a chance and that's only accounting for the people who are doing the change through the office staff."" Kelly also alleged that Americans who lost jobs to H-1B workers were evicted from apartments, while Indians could “walk in” and secure leases without “going through the proper channels to apply.” She claimed this dynamic was contributing to Texans becoming “homeless.”Additionally, she alleged that documents were being falsified during lease applications. ""Part of the application process is a background check to make sure you have no felonies and are legal here,"" she said, adding that when individuals bypass official channels, residents are left unsure “who our neighbours are.”Kelly also claimed there was “a lot of crime” connected to the issue. She described inspecting an apartment allegedly used by multiple occupants. ""One apartment in particular had complaints that people from India were rotating through it like a hotel room, once the apartment was back in our hands, I had to do a move-out inspection and I found this,"" she said, holding up a document bearing a name, passport number and address.""You can forge documents such as visas with someone else's passport number, and I have also noticed fake technology companies hiring entry-level H-1Bs and paying for 10 apartments at a time and also supplying them with the groceries they need.""She further accused Indians of discriminatory practices and referenced allegations of fraudulent degrees in India, claiming, ""the lie, scam and corruption just keeps coming to light.""""It seems like the Indian community is coming here, living above the rules, taking jobs,"" she said, also accusing residents of “trashing” properties. ""It's sad to see that the beautiful city of Frisco used to be a farmland and fresh air and now it's nothing but student driving stickers. We need to stop pandering to foreign workers and start putting Texans first,"" she concluded, drawing applause from some attendees.The controversy follows another viral incident involving American comedian Alex Stein at a Plano City Council meeting, where he mocked Hindus with cow urine slurs while dressed in Indian attire. Several Indian-American attendees reportedly walked out in protest.In recent years, the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex has seen significant growth in its Indian-origin population. By 2023, estimates placed the figure at over 150,000 residents of Indian heritage. That same year, the region ranked fourth among U.S. metropolitan areas for high-skilled worker visa approvals, many of which went to Indian nationals. Frisco, in particular, has become a popular destination due to its strong public schools and expanding job market. A New York Times report noted that roughly one-third of Frisco’s residents are of Asian heritage.At recent city council meetings, some speakers have described what they called an “Indian takeover” of the city — rhetoric that researchers say reflects a broader surge in online hostility. The Center for the Study of Organized Hate reported that posts on X featuring anti-Indian slurs, stereotypes, or calls to “deport Indians” generated 280 million views over a two-month period in 2025.The spike in anti-Indian sentiment has coincided with renewed political debate over immigration policy, including scrutiny of the H-1B visa program, under which a significant proportion of recipients are Indian nationals. The discourse has intensified amid high-profile political developments, including the rise of Indian-American public figures such as New York City mayor Zohran Mamdani at the national level.","Right-wing influencer Kaylee Campbell accused Indian-Americans of “scamming” housing communities in the Texas cities of Frisco and Plano.

Why Ramadan 2026 moon sightings can differ by location



The crescent may be visible in Gulf states first, where sunset and horizon conditions favour early detection.

It may become visible one day later in South Asia, Europe or North America due to time zone and horizon differences.

Some communities follow astronomical calculations, often announced by official bodies, while others stick strictly to visual sightings by observers after sunset.

Spiritual and social significance of sighting the moon



Ramadan 2026 Moon sighting: Saudi Arabia confirms; when will the moon be sighted in India - today or tomorrow?

Spiritual signal: Seeing the new moon represents a fresh start, prompting Muslims to begin a period of intensified faith and moral reflection.

Seeing the new moon represents a fresh start, prompting Muslims to begin a period of intensified faith and moral reflection. Community moment: It brings communities together, as families and friends gather after Maghrib prayers to look for the hilal.

It brings communities together, as families and friends gather after Maghrib prayers to look for the hilal. Lunar rhythm: Ramadan’s timing shifts earlier each year (about 10–11 days) because the lunar calendar completes a cycle faster than the solar Gregorian calendar, a fact that connects Islamic worship rhythms with the cosmos.





Every year, millions of Muslims around the world eagerly await the sighting of the Ramadan crescent moon, a moment charged with spiritual, historical and community significance. Unlike most holidays governed by a fixed date on the Gregorian calendar, Ramadan follows the Islamic lunar calendar and begins only once the new moon (hilal) is observed after maghrib or sunset on the 29th day of the preceding month, Shaban. This crescent moon sighting, sometimes visible to the naked eye and confirmed by religious committees, marks the official start of Ramadan, a month dedicated to fasting, prayer, reflection and charity.The practice of moon sighting is rooted in Islamic tradition and scripture, where seeing the crescent serves as both a marker of time and a moment of communal anticipation. Muslims gather after sunset, often looking toward the horizon with friends and family, wishing each other “Ramadan Mubarak” when the first sliver of the new moon appears. This act symbolises not just the beginning of a fast but the beginning of a month of spiritual discipline, increased worship and empathy for others.Although astronomical calculations can predict the moon’s birth, the traditional method involves local visibility at sunset, which is why countries sometimes begin Ramadan on different days. For example, Saudi Arabia and neighbouring Gulf states reported sighting the crescent on the evening of February 17, 2026, leading them to begin Ramadan on Wednesday, February 18.In contrast, many Muslim communities in South Asia, Europe and North America are looking to sight the moon on February 18, with fasting likely to start on Thursday, 19 February 2026.Ramadan is one of the Five Pillars of Islam and its observance is considered an act of devotion, self-restraint and purification. During the month, healthy adult Muslims abstain from food, drink, smoking and marital relations from dawn (suḥoor) until sunset (iftar), activities that not only reinforce self-discipline but also foster empathy for the less fortunate.The month also emphasises increased prayer and Quran recitation, nightly Taraweeh prayers and heightened acts of charity (zakat and sadaqah). It culminates in Eid ul-Fitr, the festive celebration marking the end of fasting, with communal prayers, feasting and social gatherings.While the core spiritual practices are shared worldwide, different cultures express Ramadan in various ways, from decorative lanterns in Egypt to interfaith iftars in the US, underscoring how both global unity and local tradition shape the experience.Below is a global snapshot of expected moon sighting dates and initial fasting schedules for Ramadan 2026, based on confirmed sightings, astronomical predictions and regional practices:Exact start dates can vary by region based on local moon sightings or religious authority decisions, so final announcements typically come after sunset the day before fasting begins.Since moon sighting depends on geography, atmospheric conditions and the relative position of the Earth and sun, visibility can vary greatly from one region to another. In practice:This traditional diversity of practice explains why fasting start dates sometimes differ by a day across the global Muslim population, even though the same lunar cycle is being followed.The sighting of the Ramadan crescent moon (hilal) carries profound spiritual weight in Islam because it signals the beginning of one of the Five Pillars, fasting in the sacred month of Ramadan. The practice is rooted directly in the teachings of Prophet Muhammad SAW, who tied the start and end of the fast to the physical sighting of the moon, reinforcing humility before divine timing rather than reliance solely on calculation.In an authentic hadith recorded in Sahih al-Bukhari, the Prophet SAW said, “Fast when you see it (the crescent) and break your fast when you see it, and if it is obscured from you, then complete thirty days of Sha‘ban.” (Bukhari 1909). A similar narration in Sahih Muslim states, “Do not fast until you see the crescent, and do not break the fast until you see it.”The moon is sighted on 29th and if there is no moon on 29th then 30 days of islamic month are to be completed. Narrated `Abdullah bin `Umar (RA), Allah's Messenger SAW said, “The month (can be) 29 nights (i.e. days), and do not fast till you see the moon, and if the sky is overcast, then complete Sha'ban as thirty days.” (Sahih al-Bukhari 1907, Book 30, Hadith 17).Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger SAW as saying, “Observe fast on sighting it (the new moon) and break (fast) on sighting it (the new moon), but if the sky is cloudy for you, then complete the number (of thirty).” (Reference: Sahih Muslim 1081b, in-book reference: Book 13, Hadith 21).These traditions underscore that Ramadan begins not merely as a date on a calendar but as a moment of communal witness, a collective act of obedience, unity and submission to Allah’s decree. The moon sighting thus becomes both a legal marker and a deeply symbolic reminder that Islamic worship flows in harmony with the natural rhythms created by Allah.The crescent moon’s significance in Islam is both symbolic and practical -For many believers, participating in or witnessing a moon sighting, even if only through a religious committee’s announcement, reinforces a sense of unity with Muslims across different lands, reminding them that the same sacred cycle is being celebrated from Riyadh to London to New York.Ramadan’s start is determined by seeing the crescent moon (hilal), a practice deeply woven into Islamic ritual and community life. Ramadan 2026 will likely begin on 18–19 February, depending on where the crescent is seen locally. Islamic communities across the Middle East, South Asia, Europe and North America may experience start dates that differ by a day because of geographic sighting conditions. The month emphasizes fasting from dawn until sunset, prayer, charity, reflection and community.","Ramadan begins when the new moon (hilal) is observed after maghrib or sunset on the 29th day of the preceding month.

Why Mark Zuckerberg's trial matters

In a high-stakes trial unfolding in Los Angeles Superior Court, Mark Zuckerberg , CEO of Meta Platforms, has taken the stand in a lawsuit that could reshape how social media giants are held accountable for youth safety and online harm. The case centers on allegations that Meta’s platforms, including Instagram , were designed in ways that deliberately promote addictive use among children and teens, contributing to serious mental health issues such as anxiety, depression and suicidal ideation. The trial, which also includes Google’s YouTube as a co-defendant, is widely regarded as one of the most consequential legal tests confronting Big Tech in recent years. A verdict here could influence thousands of similar lawsuits nationwide.The civil suit was filed by a plaintiff identified as “KGM,” now 20, who alleges that using platforms like Instagram from a young age fostered compulsive behaviour and exacerbated her mental health struggles. Her lawyers argue that Meta’s engagement-driven features, such as algorithmic recommendation systems and infinite scrolling, are engineered to keep young users engaged in ways that mirror addictive design practices used in other industries. Meta, for its part, vigorously denies these claims and maintains that the company has no intention to addict children or to profit from youth vulnerability. In court testimony, Zuckerberg emphasised that Meta does not allow children under 13 on Instagram, though he acknowledged it is “very difficult” to verify ages and enforce this rule perfectly.During his testimony, Zuckerberg faced intense questioning about internal policies, platform design goals and historical strategy decisions. Plaintiffs’ attorneys challenged him over past internal documents suggesting that Meta once tracked metrics related to user time spent on its apps, a key indicator critics use to argue the company prioritised engagement over safety. While Zuckerberg insisted that Meta has shifted away from those metrics in recent years, he stopped short of admitting that the platforms were engineered to intentionally create addictive behaviours.Another flashpoint in the courtroom was Instagram’s age-restriction enforcement. Zuckerberg reiterated that under-13 use is prohibited but also conceded that age verification is imperfect and that many young users misrepresent their birth years to gain access. Plaintiffs seized on this admission, arguing that Meta has known about underage engagement for years yet did not do enough to protect minors. Meta’s legal team countered by pointing to new safety features and protections rolled out in recent years, while asserting that external factors beyond their control contribute to how and why young people interact with social media.During testimony in the high-profile social media safety trial, Zuckerberg revealed that he personally reached out to Apple CEO Tim Cook to discuss the “wellbeing of teens and kids” in the digital ecosystem. The Meta chief said that the conversation was part of broader efforts to explore how major tech platforms can work together to improve online safety standards, particularly for younger users. Zuckerberg framed the outreach as evidence that youth mental health and responsible product design have become cross-industry concerns, not just competitive talking points between Silicon Valley rivals.The disclosure is notable given the often tense relationship between Meta and Apple, especially after Apple’s privacy changes disrupted Meta’s advertising business. By invoking his dialogue with Cook, Zuckerberg appeared to signal that safeguarding minors transcends corporate rivalry. The testimony comes amid mounting scrutiny over how platforms like Instagram are designed and whether engagement-driven features disproportionately affect teens. His remarks suggest that behind the scenes, tech leaders may be engaging in conversations about shared accountability, even as their companies face growing legal and regulatory pressure in courtrooms and legislatures alike.This trial is not just a test of one company’s practices, it reflects a broader legal and cultural moment where society is questioning the role of social media in children’s lives. Similar lawsuits have been filed against other platforms and although companies like TikTok and Snap Inc. reached early settlements, Meta’s case has moved forward, making Zuckerberg’s testimony especially pivotal. Legal experts describe the case as potentially precedential, with far-reaching implications for how digital platforms must consider safety in their design and business decisions.Significantly, the trial parallels debates currently unfolding in governments around the world about regulating online spaces. Some lawmakers have called for stricter age controls, algorithmic transparency and safety mandates for social media companies. In the US, discussions over reforming Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, the law that broadly shields online platforms from liability for user-generated content, have gained traction in light of cases like this one. A ruling against Meta could embolden calls for updated regulatory frameworks, while a defence victory might reinforce existing legal protections.The outcome of this trial could have multiple ripple effects. A decision against Meta could open the door for similar liability claims against other tech giants. Governments may feel increased urgency to legislate online child safety and enforce stricter age verification. Tech companies might re-examine features such as recommendation algorithms, engagement metrics and design choices linked to youth usage.The trial has amplified public discourse on the mental health impacts of social media, especially for vulnerable populations like teens and pre-teens. Critics liken this case to the Big Tobacco lawsuits of the past, where corporate design and marketing practices were scrutinised for contributing to widespread harm. If the jury finds Meta accountable or if significant evidence alters public perception, the digital landscape could face new standards of corporate responsibility and safety compliance.A landmark trial in Los Angeles is testing whether Meta’s social media platforms intentionally foster addictive use and harm children’s mental health. Mark Zuckerberg testified that while Meta prohibits under-13 users and has moved away from maximising screen time goals, age enforcement is challenging and the company disputes the core allegations. The lawsuit and thousands like it could reshape Big Tech liability, regulation and product design across the global digital ecosystem. The case is seen as a bellwether for future legal actions and regulatory reforms related to youth safety online.","Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta Platforms, has taken the stand in a lawsuit that could reshape how social media giants are held accountable for youth safety and online harm.

Russia Offers To Take Iran’s Enriched Uranium As Trump Sets 15-Day Deadline For Potential Deal





In recent weeks, the US military has built up forces close to Iran, in what President Trump has referred to as an ""armada."" The armada includes the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln, which is accompanied by three warships that are equipped with Tomahawk missiles and that were used to strike two of Iran's nuclear facilities last June. The warships also carry air defences. The carrier's stealthy F-35 fighters and F/A-18 attack planes are well within striking distance of dozens of targets in Iran.The US recently ordered a second aircraft carrier strike group to the region. This includes the navy's most advanced aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R Ford, and three of its accompanying destroyers. On Wednesday, they were on course to Strait of Gibraltar, according to flight and ship-tracking data reviewed by NYT.Additionally, another destroyer was sent to the Northern Arabian Sea, and one is en route, according to an official, bringing the total in the wider region to 13 destroyers. The Muwaffaq Salti Air Base in Jordan appears to have become a central node for the US assets of the buildup. At least two waves of attack aircraft arrived between mid-Jan and mid-Feb, bringing the number to nearly 30.In addition to the attack aircraft, four electronic warfare jets, which are used to jam radar and communications systems, arrived in Jordan at the end of Jan. And a Jan 30 satellite image showed at least five MQ-9 Reaper drones at the base.And the Pentagon has dispatched more Patriot and THAAD air defenses to help protect troops there from Iranian missiles. There are 30,000 to 40,000 US troops in the region.

‘Brown sepoy syndrome’: Startup founder's remarks on Indian-Americans adopting accents spark social media storm,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/brown-sepoy-syndrome-startup-founders-remarks-on-indian-americans-adopting-accents-spark-social-media-storm/articleshow/128576932.cms,"



A social media post by Indian entrepreneur Devaiah Bopanna has ignited a heated debate online after he questioned why some Indian-Americans, particularly high-profile CEOs and founders, appear to adopt American accents while many long-term Indian residents in the US do not.In a post that quickly gained traction on X, Bopanna reflected on his own circle of engineering friends who moved to the United States for their master’s degrees between 2008-2013 and have been living there for nearly two decades. Despite spending what he described as “about 18 years” in the country, “nearly half your speaking life” many of them, he noted, still speak without a noticeable American accent.Bopanna, co-founder of Moonshot and content head at Superteam, contrasted this with the Indian-American bankers, engineers, CEOs and founders frequently seen speaking at global summits and industry panels, many of whom, he observed, speak with a distinct Indian-American accent.He went on to ask whether picking up an accent is a ""conscious choice"" aimed at professional advancement or social acceptance. ""How can so many people not have accents and so many people do?"" he wrote, further questioning whether accent shifts are a natural adaptation process where individuals have “no control over their accents,” or a deliberate decision.While the post appeared to stem from personal curiosity, it quickly spiraled into a wider NRIs versus Indians debate in the replies.An Indian-origin Harvard graduate based in Pittsburgh swiftly explained the entire question as a matter of ""code-switching."" He claimed picking up an accent was as much about becoming ""intelligible to the average co-worker"" as it was about ""fitting in."" Additionally, he pointed out that if one has a majority of Indian coworkers and clients, then ""you probably never need to code-switch.""Another Indian-origin man who claimed to have lived in the West, including America for ""more than a decade,"" added that his accent ""did not change a bit"" and he did not feel the need to fake his accent ""like these people do.""Adding that he had seen people live in the US for a year and pick up an accent, describing the tendency as ""brown Sepoy syndrome."" The term, relatively new on the internet, is used to describe the silent withdrawal of Indians in the West, a mindset of surrender where survival and gratitude has turned into mental servitude.The debate comes amid heightened tensions surrounding immigration and identity politics in the United States. Since January 2025, under the renewed Trump administration, Indian-Americans — particularly those connected to the H-1B visa system — have faced intensified scrutiny and criticism. At the same time, some Indians on social media have criticised members of the diaspora for leaving the country in pursuit of opportunities abroad.According to a report by the Center for the Study of Organized Hate, posts on X containing anti-Indian slurs, stereotypes, or calls to “deport Indians” amassed 280 million views over a two-month period in 2025, underscoring a broader surge in anti-Indian rhetoric online.What began as a question about accents has thus unfolded into a larger conversation about assimilation, professional identity and belonging in an increasingly polarised climate.","Indian entrepreneur Devaiah Bopanna questioned why some Indian-Americans appear to adopt American accents.

Major peace push overshadowed by viral moment





A video of US President Donald Trump appearing to doze off during the launch of his “Board of Peace” has gone viral on social media, sparking debate and criticism over his energy levels and fitness for office.The footage, recorded during the inaugural meeting at the United States Institute of Peace, shows the 79-year-old president sitting with his eyes closed and head slightly drooping while military officials and global representatives delivered speeches.The moment occurred during remarks by Major General Jasper Jeffers III, when Trump appeared motionless with his eyes shut for several seconds, prompting speculation online about whether he had briefly fallen asleep.The meeting itself was significant, bringing together representatives from more than 40 countries to discuss global peace initiatives, including reconstruction efforts in Gaza and international stabilisation forces.Social media users quickly seized on the clip, with many questioning Trump’s alertness during his own high-profile event.One user wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, “Trump humiliates himself, falling fully asleep during world leader speeches at his own ‘Board of Peace’ meeting. He must be bored of peace.”Another commented, “This is absolutely humiliating on the world stage. Trump does not have the stamina to remain president.”Others mocked the viral moment more bluntly. “Trump asleep, again. The swaying is a dead giveaway,” one user posted, while another wrote, “Bored of Peace? He’s too old to be president.”The video added to a series of recent instances where Trump appeared visibly fatigued during official meetings and public events.This is not the first time Trump has addressed such incidents. Responding to similar footage from a cabinet meeting last year, Trump denied falling asleep.“Some people said, he closed his eyes. Look, it got pretty boring,” Trump said. “I didn’t sleep. I just closed them because I wanted to get the hell outta here.” He also added, “I don’t sleep much.”The White House has previously said Trump remains in good health, noting that recent medical tests were preventative and showed strong cardiac condition. Officials also attributed visible bruising on his hands to aspirin use as a precaution against cardiovascular disease.At 79, Trump is currently the oldest serving US president, and his health has remained under public scrutiny.Despite the viral moment, Trump used the meeting to announce major global peace and reconstruction initiatives.He said the United States would contribute $10 billion to support the Board of Peace’s efforts, particularly focusing on rebuilding war-affected regions such as Gaza.Trump also announced that nine countries, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Kazakhstan, had pledged more than USD 7 billion toward relief and reconstruction.In addition, Indonesia, Morocco, Albania, Kosovo and Kazakhstan agreed to deploy troops or police forces to support stabilisation efforts, while Egypt and Jordan committed to training Palestinian security personnel.Trump also urged Iran to reach a diplomatic agreement on its nuclear programme, warning that failure to do so could have serious consequences.“We have to make a meaningful deal. Otherwise, bad things happen,” Trump said, stressing that nuclear weapons would undermine peace in the Middle East.He described the Board of Peace as a body that would work alongside and strengthen the United Nations, while promoting stronger global cooperation.While the Board of Peace meeting marked a major diplomatic initiative involving dozens of countries, the viral video has drawn significant attention away from its announcements.The White House has not directly commented on the specific clip, but officials continue to emphasise Trump’s active role in international diplomacy and ongoing peace negotiations.","Video of US President Donald Trump appearing to doze off has gone viral on social media. The footage shows the 79-year-old president sitting with his eyes closed and head slightly drooping. The moment occurred during remarks by Major General Jasper Jeffers III, prompting speculation online about whether he had briefly fallen asleep.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128576426,imgsize-28828,width-400,resizemode-4/128576426.jpg"

UK PM Keir Starmer blocks Donald Trump from using RAF bases for potential Iran strike,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/uk-pm-keir-starmer-blocks-donald-trump-from-using-raf-bases-for-potential-iran-strike/articleshow/128575642.cms,"Donald Trump and Keir Starmer (File photo/AP)

Trump Warns Starmer Against Chagos Deal Ahead Of Potential Iran Strikes | DETAILS





UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer blocked Donald Trump from using RAF bases to strike Iran, amid rising tension between the US and Iran over Tehran’s refusal to sign a deal to curb its nuclear programme.The US president was thought to have withdrawn his support for Keir’s Chagos deal over the government’s refusal to give consent for the US to use UK military bases to launch bombing runs, The Telegraph reported.The US was putting together contingency plans for a direct attack on Iran, with long-range bombing and refuelling aircraft sent to the Middle East in recent days. Trump was told by defence officials that his country would be ready for war by Saturday after the largest US military build-up in the region since 2003, when America went to war in Iraq.Any US strike on Iran was likely to use the Diego Garcia military base in the Chagos Islands, the British overseas territory that the UK was planning to give away to Mauritius, and European air bases in allied countries. The US did not need consent to use Diego Garcia, but had to ask the UK govt before using RAF bases.On Wednesday, Trump told the UK to “remain strong in the face of wokeism” and not to “give away” the Chagos Islands.Posting on Truth Social, the US president said: “Should Iran decide not to make a Deal, it may be necessary for the United States to use Diego Garcia, and the Airfield located in Fairford, in order to eradicate a potential attack by a highly unstable and dangerous Regime.”Trump’s comments were understood to be a reference to a US request for permission to launch long-range bombing runs from RAF Fairford, a military base in Gloucestershire that hosted US air force personnel.However, the UK had yet to give consent owing to concerns raised by govt lawyers, first reported by The Times, that participating in the strikes could be a breach of international law.Govt sources said the UK was unlikely to support any pre-emptive military strike on Iran, following a similar refusal to participate in the US president’s attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities last summer.The UK could be held responsible for an illegal attack on Iran by the US under a UN edict passed in 2001, if it had “knowledge of the circumstances of the internationally wrongful act”.After Trump’s strikes on Iran last summer, ministers repeatedly refused to say whether Britain’s lawyers believed the strikes were legal.In his message on Wednesday, Trump laid out the bones of a legal justification for bombing Iran, arguing that a strike could “eradicate a potential attack by a highly unstable and dangerous Regime… [that] would potentially be made on the United Kingdom, as well as other friendly Countries”.The regime in Tehran said it would respond to any attack.The ultimate responsibility for govt legal advice on military strikes lay with Lord Hermer, the Attorney General, although it was unclear whether he had been directly consulted about the US’s use of RAF bases.Before last year’s US strikes on Iran, it was reported that Lord Hermer had produced legal advice warning that any British involvement beyond defending UK assets in the region would be unlawful. The Attorney General reportedly told ministers he had “concerns about the UK playing any role in this except for defending our allies”, including Israel.The full legal advice was never published, but Whitehall sources told The Telegraph on Thursday that the UK was still unlikely to participate in any pre-emptive strikes on Iran, indicating that the British legal position had not changed.During the last month, the Ministry of Defence deployed additional Typhoon and F-35 fighter jets to the region in anticipation of any Iranian response to an attack by the US.Trump could also launch a strike on Iran from Diego Garcia, a base it was only required to “notify” Britain about using, under the terms of a treaty between the two countries.Under Keir’s Chagos deal, the sovereignty of the islands would pass to Mauritius, while the base would be leased back at a cost of £35bn over 99 years.Trump repeatedly flipped between support for and opposition to the deal, which he said last month was an act of “great stupidity”. He then said that he believed the agreement was the best that Keir could have struck to maintain control of the base amid legal challenges from Mauritius in the international courts.On Wednesday, the US president returned to his earlier position, writing on Truth Social: “We will always be ready, willing, and able to fight for the U.K., but they have to remain strong in the face of Wokeism, and other problems put before them. DO NOT GIVE AWAY DIEGO GARCIA!”",US president thought to have withdrawn support for Keir Starmer's Chagos deal. US was putting together contingency plans for a direct attack on Iran.

Lake Tahoe avalanche: How six survivors used iPhone SOS to alert rescuers after deadly Castle Peak slide,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/lake-tahoe-avalanche-how-six-survivors-used-iphone-sos-to-alert-rescuers-after-deadly-castle-peak-slide/articleshow/128575637.cms,"Survivors used iPhone SOS, avalanche beacons to call rescuers

Survivors endured hours beside victims

Avalanche risk was high amid storm conditions





15 backcountry skiers enjoying a guided trip near Lake Tahoe were caught in a powerful avalanche, leaving eight dead, six survivors rescued after hours in freezing conditions, and one person still missing, authorities said.The avalanche struck late Tuesday morning in the Castle Peak area of the Tahoe National Forest as the group was returning from a three-day skiing expedition led by Blackbird Mountain Guides.According to officials from the Nevada County Sheriff's Office, one skier shouted “Avalanche!” moments before a massive wall of snow swept down the slope, engulfing the group.Authorities received an emergency alert around 11:30 am local time. Rescue crews later confirmed that eight people had died in the slide, six survived, and one remained unaccounted for.The avalanche occurred in a remote, rugged part of the Sierra Nevada during severe winter storm conditions, making rescue operations extremely difficult.Officials said the six survivors managed to stay alive for several hours in freezing temperatures by using emergency gear and creating a temporary shelter with a tarp.Crucially, the group used avalanche beacon devices and the iPhone SOS emergency feature to alert rescuers and maintain contact while waiting for help. At least one guide was able to send text messages to authorities, helping pinpoint their location.Rescue teams reached the survivors shortly after 5:30 pm, more than six hours after the avalanche struck. A snowcat was used to transport them safely from the area. Two survivors suffered non-life-threatening injuries and were taken to hospital.By the time rescuers arrived, survivors had already discovered three of their companions dead in the snow. Officials said the survivors ranged in age from 30 to 55 years and included one guide.Authorities described the avalanche zone as extremely dangerous, with deep snow, unstable terrain and severe weather hampering search efforts.Experts said avalanche danger in the area was rated 4 out of 5, considered “high risk”, due to heavy snowfall and unstable snowpack. Investigators believe a weak layer beneath fresh snow collapsed, triggering the deadly slide.Officials have not yet released the identities of the victims, saying families are still being notified.Search operations are continuing for the missing skier, though authorities warned that worsening weather and hazardous terrain could complicate efforts further.","15 backcountry skiers enjoying a guided trip near Lake Tahoe were caught in a powerful avalanche, leaving eight dead.

25-year-old Sukhdeep Singh , an Indian man, arrested after his truck caused a three-vehicle collision killing a 64-year-old in Indiana, was taken into ICE custody because not only was he driving wrong and cost a life but he was also in Indiana illegally. A major outrage began as yet another Indian was found behind the wheel of a killer truck that ran the red light.According to reports, Singh has been living in Indiana illegally. He was caught at the border in 2018 by the 1st Trump administration when he was a minor but was released. He was formally living in New York and as of January of this year, he was living in New Palestine, Indiana.""Looking at his Indiana driving history, he has 5 citations since 2022 and many are wondering how he was able to get a CDL in Indiana. We don't yet know the answer,"" Fox anchor Angela Ganote said.Ganote claimed that Singh is a repeat offender. ""He was ticketed for not having insurance after a car crash on January 8th on Harding Street. He has 3 previous speeding tickets where he was accused of traveling 89 in a 70, 76 in a 55 and 74-55.

‘I almost terminated him’: Why did Donald Trump say he wanted to fire US Secretary of State Marco Rubio?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/i-almost-terminated-him-why-did-donald-trump-say-he-wanted-to-fire-us-secretary-of-state-marco-rubio/articleshow/128572268.cms,"



US President Donald Trump joked about sharing the limelight with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and first lady Melania Trump at the inaugural meeting of his Board of Peace on February 19, 2026, in Washington, DC, as the body oversaw the Gaza ceasefire between Israel and Hamas and the rebuilding of the region.Trump told dozens of world leaders attending the meeting that Rubio made him so proud he “almost terminated his"" employment, but observers asked why Trump could not make a similar speech.""You did yourself proud in Munich. In fact, so well, I almost terminated his employment. Because they said, why can't Trump do this?!"" Trump said.“I do, but I say it differently,” Trump said. “But Marco, don’t do any better than you did, please. Because if you do, you’re out of here,” Trump added, to laughter.Rubio recently won some international kudos for a message of unity, saying ""Europe will never be irrelevant"" during a speech on Feb. 14 at the Munich Security Conference. Melania Trump was riding a wave of popularity after the Feb. 1 release of her eponymous documentary.Referring to his wife, Trump said his rule of thumb was that each family could only have one star.“I always say there’s not room in one family for two stars,” Trump said. “I told her that.”Trump said he was proud of her and that the “people of the United States love the first lady.” But he fretted about having two prominent people under one roof.“You can’t have two stars in one family. I don’t know what that means but it’s not good,” Trump said. “But it is good because we’re proud of her.”Trump created the Board of Peace to oversee the Gaza ceasefire between Israel and Hamas and the rebuilding of the region. Countries including Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Morocco, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Uzbekistan pledged $7 billion toward Gaza relief. Trump said the United States would provide $10 billion.His speech came as political observers portrayed Rubio and Vice President JD Vance as jockeying for potential 2028 campaigns for president. Rubio and Vance said they were not rivals.Rubio’s speech contrasted sharply from Vance’s a year ago at the same security conference in Germany. Vance criticised European leaders for policies on migration, defence and free speech. Rubio brought his message of unity with Europe while saying its leaders also made mistakes.“Marco does it with a velvet glove, but it’s a kill,” Trump said. “Trust me. The result is the same. They do it very differently.”Trump said Vance “gets a little bit tough on occasion.” But the President made a point of saying that Rubio and Vance had both done “great.”The Board of Peace was assembled to raise money for the rebuilding and stabilisation of Gaza and was formally established on the sidelines of World Economic Forum in January of 2026.",President Donald Trump joked about sharing the limelight with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and first lady Melania Trump at the inaugural meeting of his Board of Peace.

Trump withdraws support for Chagos deal as four Chagossians land on disputed archipelago saying they plan to settle there,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-withdraws-support-for-chagos-deal-as-four-chagossians-land-on-disputed-archipelago-saying-they-plan-to-settle-there/articleshow/128572836.cms,"US President Donald Trump (AP)





LONDON: US President Donald Trump has, in a U-turn, withdrawn US support for British Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s deal to hand the Chagos Islands over to Mauritius, calling it a “big mistake” and saying the claims made on the island “are fictitious”.In a post on Truth Social on Wednesday, Trump called the 99-year lease Starmer has negotiated for the largest island, Diego Garcia, which hosts a joint UK-US military base, in exchange for handing over sovereignty of the entire archipelago to Mauritius ""tenuous, at best”. He wrote: “This land should not be taken away from our ally” and said the US may use the military base in the event of a war with Iran. He wrote that the UK “have to remain strong in the face of Wokeism…DO NOT GIVE AWAY DIEGO GARCIA!”The president’s attack on Starmer was a sharp reversal from two weeks ago and in direct contrast to a statement made on Tuesday by the US state department which said it “supports the decision of the UK to proceed with its agreement with Mauritius concerning the Chagos archipelago”.It comes as four Chagossians landed on the archipelago in a rubber dinghy on Monday saying they plan to settle there. They include govt-in-exile first minister Misley Mandarin and his father Michel Mandarin (74), who was born on the island and removed from it when he was 14 and sent to Mauritius.Chagossians were forcibly removed by the UK between 1968 and 1973, at the request of the US, to make way for the military base, and displaced to Mauritius, Seychelles and the UK.On Wednesday a British patrol boat arrived and officials served the men, accompanied by ex Tory MP Adam Holloway, an eviction notice threatening prison or a £3,000 fine. The men vowed to stay and Misley said the British authorities will have to “kill” him to remove him.An FCDO spokesperson said: “There is no legal right for anyone to enter the territory without a valid permit, regardless of their citizenship or heritage”, and called it an “illegal unsafe stunt”, adding it was working with Mauritius to resume a programme of heritage visits to the Chagos Archipelago for Chagossians. The spokesperson also indicated that Starmer planned to push ahead with the deal, saying it is “the only way to guarantee the long-term future of this vital military base” on Diego Garcia.","US President Donald Trump has, in a U-turn, withdrawn US support for British Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s deal to hand the Chagos Islands over to Mauritius.

At least 16 people, including women and children, were killed and 14 others injured after a gas explosion caused a partial collapse of a residential building in Karachi’s Soldier Bazaar area, Dawn reported on Thursday.The blast occurred around 4.15 am during Sehri at a residence in Gul Rana Colony, according to assistant superintendent of police (ASP) Jamshed Asher. He said the explosion took place on the building’s first floor. The injured and the deceased were shifted to Civil Hospital.Rescue authorities later confirmed that the death toll had risen to 16.Rescue chief operating officer Dr Abid Jalaluddin Shaikh told the media that a gas explosion led to the structure’s partial collapse. He said the ground-plus-two-storey structure comprised small, individual rooms, which made rescue efforts difficult.“This is not a legal building, and the structure is made of individual rooms,” he said, adding that nearby structures were also damaged.According to a list issued by Rescue 1122, the deceased included eight minors, four women and four men, aged between two and 60 years. Among the injured were seven minors.Search and rescue operations were ongoing, with an urban search and rescue team and a disaster response vehicle deployed at the site.A district east police spokesperson said law enforcement personnel cordoned off the area soon after the incident was reported. “Police cordoned off the area and tightened security, while rescue agencies initiated a search and rescue operation,” the spokesperson said.Sindh chief minister Murad Ali Shah, taking notice of the incident, expressed grief over the loss of lives.He directed authorities to “immediately rescue people trapped under the debris” and ensure the “best possible” medical treatment for the injured. He also ordered support for affected families and asked the Karachi commissioner to investigate the cause.Building collapses remain frequent in Karachi, home to over 20 million people, amid concerns over unsafe construction, illegal structures and ageing infrastructure. In July 2025, at least 27 people were killed when a five-storey building collapsed in Lyari. Authorities had earlier declared the structure uninhabitable. The Sindh Building Control Authority has previously said that 588 buildings across the city had been declared dangerous.","The blast occurred around 4.15 am during Sehri at a residence in Gul Rana Colony.

Pakistan Army Chief Asim Munir was briefly stopped and asked to produce his identity card by security staff at the Munich Security Conference in Germany.A video that went viral on social media showed a security officer asking the Pakistani army chief to keep his identity card visible. Just steps away from the conference entry, a security official is heard saying, “Stop… where is your ID? Please flip your ID card. ”The Munich Security Conference, widely regarded as a key platform for dialogue and conflict resolution, annually brings together world leaders, diplomats, and security experts to address international peace and security challenges.Meanwhile, Munir’s visit was also objected to by Germany-based Sindhi political organisation Jeay Sindh Muttahida Mahaz (JSMM), which called the invitation “deeply regrettable.” Members of the JSMM protested outside the venue, highlighting alleged human rights violations in Pakistan.In a formal statement addressed to the United Nations, the European Union, the German government, and international human rights bodies, JSMM Chairman Shafi Burfat expressed what he described as “deep shock and regret” over Munir’s presence at the high-level global forum.JSMM alleged that Pakistan’s military establishment has a historical record of human rights violations and political interference.The group referred to the 1971 events in former East Pakistan that led to the creation of Bangladesh, describing them as genocide. It also accused Pakistan’s military and intelligence agencies of supporting extremist elements in the region — allegations that Islamabad has consistently denied.The organisation further claimed that Pakistan’s military wields disproportionate influence over the country’s political and judicial institutions. It cited the assassinations of former leaders, including Liaquat Ali Khan and Benazir Bhutto, as well as the execution of former Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, as examples of alleged instability linked to military dominance.

'Imran Khan’s Health Stable, But Facing Mental Torture', Claims Sister After Jail Visit





PTI founder and former prime minister Imran Khan underwent an eye examination at Adiala Jail on Sunday following a Supreme Court order, with Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) calling the process as “malicious” and questioning the exclusion of his family and personal doctors.According to news website Dawn, a five-member medical team conducted a detailed examination that lasted about an hour. The doctors collected blood samples, measured his blood pressure and brought their own equipment. The process reportedly began after a two-and-a-half-hour wait and a report is expected to be compiled soon.Shortly after the examination ended around 5.30 pm, PTI issued a statement on X rejecting the procedure and objecting to the absence of Imran’s family and personal physicians.“Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf categorically rejects the recent conduct of the government and jail administration regarding the medical examination of former prime minister Imran Khan's eye in Adiala Jail. The government's claim that a message was sent to the party leadership to arrive at the jail at the time of the examination is, in fact, a crude attempt to divert attention from the core issue,” the party said.Explaining its objection, the statement added, “This matter was never about the presence or absence of the party leadership.In such sensitive and delicate medical matters, the constitutional, moral, and legal right to make decisions belongs to Imran Khan's family. The family cannot make an informed decision until Imran Khan's personal doctors are present for the examination. Therefore, inviting the party leadership symbolically has neither any moral rationale nor any legal justification. ”Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum also said that no medical board would be accepted without the approval of his personal doctors.Referring to reports that he might be shifted to Al-Shifa Eye Hospital in Rawalpindi, she reiterated, “Our demand has been clear from the beginning. Imran Khan shall not be given any treatment without the presence and approval of his personal doctors and family members.”She further said, “We do not accept any medical board they set up and control! We do not accept any reports or results they manufacture.”Questioning the exclusion of family members and doctors recommended by Imran’s team, she asked, “Why are they rejecting the supervision by Imran Khan's personal doctors? Why are they rejecting the presence of Imran Khan's family members? Why such fierce resistance? Are they hiding something?”The examination was carried out after the Supreme Court directed the formation of a medical board to assess Imran’s condition. The order followed his claim on February 12 that his right eye retained only 15 per cent vision. The court also allowed him to speak with his children before February 16.Although government officials had indicated on Saturday that Imran might be transferred to a hospital, no shift had taken place by Sunday afternoon. At 3.45 pm, his sister Noreen Khanum said that an ambulance had arrived at the jail to move him.“But, this is unacceptable to us without us and Khan sahib's personal doctors being taken into confidence,” she said.The jail superintendent dismissed reports of a transfer as a “rumour” and clarified that only a medical examination was underway.“The medical team will examine Imran's eyes, conduct different tests, and decide whether there is a requirement to move him to a hospital or if he can be retained in jail and continue the treatment here,” the superintendent said.Imran had earlier undergone a medical procedure at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences in Islamabad on the night of January 24, a development that was confirmed later amid limited information shared with his family.Imran’s personal physicians, Aasim Yusuf and Faisal Sultan, also called for a comprehensive evaluation at Shifa International Hospital in Islamabad, news agnecy PTI reported citing Dawn.In a joint video statement they said, “In addition to urgent retina specialist care for his central retinal vein occlusion and severe vision loss, Imran Khan needs a full multidisciplinary evaluation of his underlying conditions at a tertiary hospital like Shifa International Islamabad.”Meanwhile, the Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) alliance continued its sit-in at Parliament House for the third day, demanding that Imran be treated at a hospital chosen by his personal doctors.PTI MNA Asad Qaiser told reporters, “We will not compromise on Imran's health.”A TTAP leader said that the initial understanding to shift Imran to Shifa International collapsed due to demands to change the composition of the medical board. The alliance also alleged that access to food, water and medicines inside Parliament House had been blocked for the third day.Describing the reported denial of medicine to Senator Abbas as an “extreme and condemnable act,” the alliance said, “Prioritising any political disagreement over human compassion and medical needs is the worst form of oppression.”Vowing to continue the protest, TTAP stated, “History bears witness that tyrannical tricks, sieges, and oppression have never suppressed movements, nor forced those standing firm on the right side to back down from their demands.”The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan expressed grave concern over the health of PTI-affiliated prisoners, particularly Imran Khan and Yasmin Rashid and urged authorities to ensure immediate independent medical examinations and uninterrupted access to treatment.",Imran Khan underwent an eye examination at Adiala Jail on Sunday following a Supreme Court order.

Baloch Leader Akhtar Mengal Stuns Pakistan, Says Balochistan's 'Separation Is The Only Option Now'





The recent disappearances of several people in Balochistan have been linked to Pakistan’s security apparatus, sparking fear and anxiety among families.At least seven individuals are reported missing in incidents connected to Panjgur and Karachi.Residents of Pulabad, a locality in Panjgur, described a recent raid where armed personnel searched homes and detained at least six people. Witnesses said those taken were transported to unknown locations. Locals mentioned two names, Inayat and Rasheed, while the identities of the other detainees could not be independently confirmed, reported ANI citing The Balochistan Post.In a separate case, 23-year-old Zulfiqar, son of Hameed and a resident of Tasp, was reportedly seized from a marketplace on February 13, 2026. Locals alleged that men linked to a state-backed armed faction, commonly described as a “death squad,” carried out the detention. Family members have not received any information regarding his condition since the incident.Another case raising alarm involves Zakir Noor, a student from Panjgur, who was allegedly detained in Karachi on December 30, 2025.The Baloch rights organisation Paank said he was taken by security personnel without legal documentation.Noor has not contacted his family since, fueling fears he may have been transferred to an undisclosed detention site.Paank said secret confinement places detainees at serious risk and violates international safeguards against arbitrary arrest. Activists added that the pattern disproportionately affects students and young men, especially those who migrate to major cities for education or work.","At least seven individuals are reported missing in incidents connected to Panjgur and Karachi.

'We were not consulted': Imran Khan’s sister

(With AP inputs)





Pakistan’s information minister Ataullah Tarar on Saturday announced that imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan will undergo treatment for an eye condition at a specialised medical facility, days after the Supreme Court ordered a medical evaluation amid growing concerns about the cricketer-turned-politician’s eyesight.Tarar wrote on X that an examination would be conducted by leading eye specialists as part of Khan’s ongoing treatment, which began in late January after the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder-chairman claimed ""partial loss of vision"" in his right eye.The minister, however, did not specify the medical facility or the date of treatment and urged the public to avoid speculation.“A detailed report will also be submitted to the Supreme Court. Conjecture, speculations, and efforts to turn this into political rhetoric and mileage for vested interests may please be avoided,” Tarar posted.Earlier this week, Khan’s lawyer and PTI member Salman Safdar told the Supreme Court that the ex-premier had lost roughly 85% of vision in his right eye. The court subsequently directed authorities to arrange a medical assessment by a panel of doctors and facilitate a telephone call between Khan and his two UK-based sons before February 16.PTI supporters have staged protests in the capital, Islamabad, and other cities, demanding that their party chief be shifted from prison to a hospital for specialised treatment. Some lawmakers from PTI and its allies are also staging a sit-in outside Parliament.Meanwhile, Khan’s sister Aleema Khan reacted angrily to Tarar's announcement, saying the family had not been consulted and demanding that family members and his personal physician be present during any future procedures.She confirmed that, following the Supreme Court’s directive, authorities had arranged a call between her brother and his two sons, who live with their mother and his former wife, British screenwriter and producer Jemima Goldsmith.Khan was removed from office in a parliamentary no-confidence vote in April 2022. He has alleged that his ouster was the result of a US-backed “conspiracy” involving political rivals and Pakistan’s then army chief, Qamar Javed Bajwa — allegations denied by Washington, Pakistan’s military, and Khan’s political opponents.The issue of Khan’s partial vision surfaced in late January when the federal government said the former prime minister had undergone a medical procedure for an eye condition and was in ""good health.""The PTI made a strong showing in the February 2024 parliamentary elections but did not secure a majority in the National Assembly, the lower house of Parliament. The party alleged the vote was “rigged,” a claim the government has denied.","Pakistan’s information minister Ataullah Tarar on Saturday announced that imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan will undergo treatment for an eye condition.

Imran Khan’s Family Stages Prayer Protest After Being Barred From Meeting Him At Adiala Jail





The Supreme Court of Pakistan on Thursday directed authorities to constitute a medical board to assess the health of jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan after reports surfaced about a loss of vision in one of his eyes.A bench comprising Chief Justice Yahya Afridi and Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan also instructed officials to facilitate communication between Khan and his two sons, who live in the United Kingdom with his former wife, British producer and screenwriter Jemima Goldsmith.“The issue of Imran’s health is most important. Intervention is necessary. His phone calls with his son are also important,” Chief Justice Afridi said during the hearing.The order came after the bench resumed hearing a case about the jail conditions of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder-president and ordered a detailed medical check-up before February 16. During the hearing, Attorney General Mansoor Usman Awan said it was the state’s responsibility to provide the former prime minister with medical care.The order also came two days after the court asked PTI leader and lawyer Salman Safdar to meet Khan at Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail, where the cricketer-turned-politician has been held since August 5, 2023, following his conviction in a corruption case.Safdar later submitted his report to the court after meeting Khan. It was the first meeting with the jailed leader since December 2, when his sister, Uzma Khan, was allowed to see him for 20 minutes.Meanwhile, Dawn newspaper, citing the report, noted that it detailed Safdar’s meeting with Khan, the condition of his cell, the facilities provided to him, a description of his living area and the process the lawyer followed to reach the jail.In the report, Safdar quoted Khan as stating that despite receiving treatment, including an injection, he has only 15% vision left in his right eye.Khan reportedly told Safdar that until October 2025, he had normal vision in both eyes. He later began experiencing constant blurred and hazy vision, which he repeatedly reported to the then jail superintendent, but no action was taken.The report added that Khan eventually suffered a sudden and complete loss of vision in his right eye. An eye specialist from Pims Hospital, Dr Muhammad Arif, was then called to examine him.He was diagnosed with a blood clot that caused serious damage. Despite treatment, including an injection, his vision in the right eye remains at only 15 per cent.A day earlier, Safdar denied making any statement about Khan’s health on Tuesday, clarifying that anything attributed to him on the matter had been misrepresented or misreported.However, on the day he met Khan, Safdar told reporters that the jailed leader was “fine and healthy.”","The Supreme Court of Pakistan has ordered a medical board to assess the health of Imran Khan.

Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif has delivered a scathing assessment of his country’s past alliances with Washington, telling the National Assembly that Islamabad had been “used like toilet paper and then discarded” after serving American interests in Afghanistan.Speaking during a debate on terrorism following a deadly suicide bombing at a Shia mosque in Islamabad, Asif said Pakistan had repeatedly joined “superpower wars” that were never its own.“We took part in two wars that were fought on the soil of Afghanistan,” Asif told lawmakers. Referring to the Soviet intervention in 1979, he claimed it was carried out “at the invitation of the government in Kabul” and that the narrative of an outright invasion was shaped by the United States.Pakistan, he said, entered those conflicts “in the name of Islam and religion”, but in reality two former military dictators sought legitimacy and the backing of a global power.“These were not our wars; they were superpower wars,” he said, adding that Pakistan and its land were used and then discarded ""like toilet paper.""Asif went on to describe terrorism in Pakistan as the “blowback of mistakes committed by dictators in the past”.He added that Pakistan had failed to learn from history, continuing to shift between Washington, Moscow and London in pursuit of short-term interests.""For our own interests, we sometimes turn to Washington, sometimes to Moscow, and sometimes to Britain. We have built strong franchises here, which was not the case 30 or 40 years ago,"" Asif said.Recalling then US President Bill Clinton’s brief stop in Islamabad in 2000, a visit lasting only a few hours at the end of a longer India trip, Asif said it underscored how transactional the relationship had become. Clinton’s engagement with then military ruler Pervez Musharraf was framed by US demands on democracy, non-proliferation and militancy, reinforcing.Asif’s remarks came as parliament passed a resolution condemning the attack on Imambargah Qasr-e-Khadijatul Kubra in Islamabad’s Tarlai area, where a suicide bomber killed 31 people and wounded 169 during Friday prayers. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility. Thousands attended funerals across the capital as grieving families demanded accountability. “What happened yesterday has left us extremely angry and deeply hurt,” said Bushra Rahmani, whose brother was among the wounded.The minister urged political unity, lamenting what he called a lack of consensus even in condemning terrorism. “It is very important that we have a national identity on which no one disagrees,” he said, criticising those who, for political reasons, avoided attending the funerals of victims.","Defence minister Khawaja Asif criticises Pakistan's past alliances with the U.S. and Russia.

‘China no longer trusts us’

Backdrop of deadly Islamabad attack





Pakistan’s Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman on Sunday launched a sharp attack on Pakistan’s handling of militancy and its Afghanistan policy, questioning how extremist elements continue to cross the border even as trade remains blocked.Speaking at a public gathering in Rawalpindi, Rehman highlighted what he described as a glaring contradiction in Islamabad’s approach towards Afghanistan. “In all these decades, we never paused to ask why our Afghan policy failed so miserably. Not a single pomegranate or melon can enter Pakistan, yet terrorists keep crossing the border,” he said, smiling as he made the remark.Referring to repeated claims by Pakistani authorities that militants were entering from Afghanistan, Rehman added, “Authorities say terrorists are coming from there. If they are coming, stop them. If they are coming, eliminate them. The Afghan government has never objected to your actions.”The JUI-F leader also criticised Pakistan’s broader foreign and economic policies, calling them “complete failures”. He said Islamabad’s diplomatic approach had left the country increasingly isolated.“India is our enemy, Afghanistan is our enemy, and even Iran and China are upset with us,” Rehman said, adding that the public deserved answers.“A nation cannot survive when its policies produce only isolation, mistrust and insecurity.”He argued that Pakistan’s foreign policy was being driven not by elected governments but by the military establishment. “One general comes and says we will negotiate; another comes and says we will wage war,” he said.Rehman also took aim at the government’s handling of the China-Pakistan economic corridor (CPEC), claiming that the flagship infrastructure project had stalled due to declining Chinese confidence.“CPEC has seen no real progress during this tenure because China no longer trusts us,” he said, questioning whether “even a single brick” had moved under the current government. He claimed Beijing had expected the Pakistan democratic movement (PDM) government to stabilise relations and revive projects, but remained dissatisfied.Rehman’s remarks come amid heightened tensions following a suicide bombing at a mosque in Islamabad on Friday that killed 69 people and injured more than 170, according to local media reports citing hospital officials. The blast occurred during Friday prayers at Imambargah Qasr-i-Khadijatul Kubra in the Tarlai area, Dawn reported.After Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif suggested on X that preliminary findings pointed to the attacker having travelled to and from Afghanistan, Kabul rejected the allegation. Afghanistan’s ministry of national defence termed the claim “irresponsible and baseless” and urged Pakistani authorities to take responsibility for internal security lapses, Afghan media outlet Ariana News reported.The Afghan ministry said similar accusations had been made in the past following attacks in Balochistan and other parts of Pakistan, without conclusive evidence.","Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman criticises Pakistan’s handling of militancy and its Afghanistan policy.

""No Control Over Minority Violence In Bangladesh..."": Former Indian Envoy Slams Yunus Govt





Nitai Roy Chowdhury, 77, lone Hindu minister in PM Tarique Rahman-led govt and vice-chairman of Bangladesh Nationalist Party's central committee, said the administration was committed to ensuring the safety of all minorities and restoring cordial relations with India, asserting that fundamentalism would not be allowed to spread in Bangladesh.Chowdhury spoke to TOI in an exclusive interview over phone after taking oath as culture minister along with 48 other members, including state ministers, in the cabinet headed by Rahman.Among the 25 newly elected members of National Parliament from BNP who took oath as ministers alongside the newly sworn-in PM, Chowdhury won from Magura-2 constituency.He received over 1.4 lakh votes, defeating Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami's Mustarshid Billah, who secured about 1.2 lakh votes. Referring to the state of governance he inherited, Chowdhury said the previous govt led by Sheikh Hasina had left the country's institutions in tatters.""Almost everything was in disorder,"" he said, adding that after being elected to form the new govt, it was their duty to bring the country back on track. He said the BNP did not want to indulge in criticism of the past but aimed to move forward with new hopes and dreams to put Bangladesh on the path of development.Explaining what he meant by institutional damage, Chowdhury alleged that when Hasina fled Bangladesh in 2024, the country was ""completely broken"". He claimed the biggest damage was done to the education system, alleging that it had become policy under Awami League to pass 98% of students in exams irrespective of merit. ""It was done to falsely show that literacy rate of Bangladesh was increasing along with the passing percentage of students,"" he said.He also accused the previous regime of damaging the country's cultural fabric. During the Awami League govt, he said, ""all sorts of obscene dance and music along with hooliganism were encouraged while pushing our actual cultural values on the backburner."" He said the new govt would work to repair these pillars while upholding the ethos of unity in diversity, which he claimed had been ruined.On apprehensions regarding the safety of minorities, particularly Hindus, Chowdhury pointed to what he described as a significant turnout of Hindu voters in the recent elections. He said such turnout was not witnessed in other communities and reflected a shift in political thinking.""Hindus realised that they cannot be treated as mere vote-bank by any party in Bangladesh. They felt that they are an inseparable part of this Bangladesh,"" Chowdhury said.He said the PM and other BNP leaders met Hindu voters before the elections to assure them of safety and security. ""They realised that they too are independent citizens of this country with equal rights to life and livelihood as mentioned in our constitution. Hence, they voted in large numbers for the BNP, for which we are grateful,"" he said.Chowdhury said most political parties had now realised the importance of Hindus in electoral politics, noting that their support was crucial in at least 80 of the total 297 constituencies in parliament. He said that earlier the majority of Hindu voters had supported Awami League, but after its leaders fled, many felt insecure. He credited Rahman with working to remove that fear and win their support.On ties with India, Chowdhury said it was the new administration's duty to develop good relations with all neighbours, including India. ""We want to have ties which have mutual respect, interest, and understanding,"" he said. ""We will work on issues related to internal security of both Bangladesh and India,"" he added.As culture minister, Chowdhury said Bengali culture was rich and that Bangladesh had cultural ties with at least 48 countries, including India. He saidgovt would strengthen these ties by focusing on traditions followed by previous generations while fighting fundamentalism.","Chowdhury spoke to TOI in an exclusive interview over phone after taking oath as culture minister along with 48 other members, including state ministers, in the cabinet headed by Rahman.

'Bad Neighbours Who Persist With Terror': Jaishankar Warns Pakistan, Hopes Improved Bangladesh Ties





Bangladesh will seek respectful, mutually beneficial relations with all nations, particularly its neighbours, grounded in sovereign equality and shared interests, the new Tarique Rahman-led BNP govt said Wednesday, indicating its intention for a reassessment of Bangladesh-India relations, strained during the 18-month tenure of the Muhammad Yunus-led interim govt.Newly appointed foreign minister Khalilur Rahman announced that “Bangladesh First” would serve as the central organising principle of the country’s foreign policy. Under this framework, he said, “we aim at maintaining good relations with all countries, especially our neighbours, based on respect and mutual benefit.” “There will be comprehensive reassessment of Bangladesh’s external engagement, anchored in sovereign equality, non-interference in internal affairs, national dignity and honour, and reciprocity,” he told reporters.“The govt’s commitment is to a balanced and pragmatic engagement and where complexities or stagnation exist, efforts will continue to resolve obstacles and normalise ties,” Khalilur said — as the BNP has already indicated that though the new govt will not stop seeking former PM Sheikh Hasina’s extradition from New Delhi, the “issue” will not be a roadblock. “Our foreign policy will be guided exclusively by national interest,” he added.“It will not be shaped by partisan considerations.”“Foreign policy is a very serious matter,” Khalilur said, adding that “the goal is to build a foreign policy that reflects the will and aspirations of the people of Bangladesh and pledges a strategy rooted in national interest and constructive global engagement”.Meanwhile, home minister Salahuddin Ahmed, after the first meeting of the Tarique-led cabinet, said the days of “mob culture is over” in Bangladesh. Ahmed said, “Mob culture is over in Bangladesh. Mob culture cannot be encouraged in any way.” He said there will be demands but those demands must be raised through proper processes and forums. Democratic culture will continue, the minister said.","Newly appointed foreign minister Khalilur Rahman announced that “Bangladesh First’ would serve as the central organising principle of the country’s foreign policy. “Our foreign policy will be guided exclusively by national interest,” he added.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128535347,imgsize-645715,width-400,resizemode-4/128535347.jpg"

Tarique Rahman, in his maiden speech after becoming Bangladesh PM, outlined his govt’s priorities, stressing on improving the law and order situation and turning the country into a safe land for people of all faiths, regardless of party, opinion, religion, or ethnicity. He said, “As the head of the govt, I would like to draw the attention of the people of the country to one important matter — whether you voted for BNP, did not vote for it, or did not vote at all, you all have equal rights to this govt.”His remarks that were seen as an outreach to members of Bangladesh’s largest Islamist party Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI) who screamed fraud after finishing — despite with increased support — far behind BNP, and also possibly supporters of Sheikh Hasina’s Awami League which was debarred from elections.The address also read like an indictment of the former Muhammad Yunus-led interim govt, with Tarique emphasising that the new govt has begun its journey amid a fragile economy battered by corruption and misrule during, what he described, as a period of fascism, along with weak governance structures and a deteriorating law-and-order situation. “Restoring peace and security in the minds of the people by improving law and order and strictly controlling corruption is the priority of our govt,” he said.Tarique said every constitutional, govt and non-govt institution in the country will run according to established rules and regulations. “The rule of law — not party or political influence or coercion — will be final in running the state,” he said.In his address, he did not elaborate on his foreign policy. He, however, at the beginning of his speech said that “in a Bangladesh freed from subservience, a new govt accountable to the people through their votes has begun its journey”.Earlier on Wednesday, Tarique chaired the first meeting of the cabinet, which set a 180day priority plan, a departure from the norm of 100-day plans, with focus on controlling commodity prices, maintaining law and order, stabilising supply chains, and ensuring uninterrupted gas and electricity supply, home minister Salahuddin Ahmed was quoted as saying by the Daily Star newspaper.","Tarique Rahman outlined his govt’s priorities, stressing on improving the law and order situation and turning the country into a safe land for people of all faiths, regardless of party, opinion, religion, or ethnicity.

: Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes, a female Democrat, has opened an investigation into comments by MAGA supremo Donald Trump wondering how ""war hawk"" Liz Cheney would feel if guns were ""trained on her face"" as a potentially prosecutable offense, amid a raging gender clash in the US Presidential election.""I have already asked my criminal division chief to start looking at that statement, analyzing it for whether it qualifies as a death threat under Arizona's laws,"" Mayes said in a TV interview even as Kamala Harris said such violent rhetoric should be disqualifying. Her campaign managers added that it was tantamount to suggesting Cheney be put before a firing squad.""Think about the contrast. You have Trump talking about sending a prominent Republican to the firing squad... Vice president Harris is talking about sending one to her Cabinet,"" Harris' senior advisor Ian Sams said.Political pundits and gun experts are still trying to figure out what liberal critics say is Trump's purported ""execution fantasy"" in which he wanted Cheney to face ""nine barrels."" A firing squad can vary in number. Most states have outlawed firing squads. The last death by firing squad took place in Utah in 2010. But the comment has triggered outrage in Democratic ranks, particularly women, and Harris supporters hope it will rouse at least some female Trump supporters who appear to have no problems with his rhetoric.Polls show Harris leading by an average of 11 points among women while Trump leads by 10 points among men — a 21-point gap in the vote margin. Women make up a larger share of the US electorate than men. Early voting data in the current election, where almost 70 million voters have already cast ballots, shows women making up about 55 percent of early voters in battleground states. This is offset by Trump running about five points ahead among men than he did against Biden in 2020.Although Kamala Harris has been careful not to emphasize gender (or race and ethnicity for that matter) contours of a women v men battle has taken shape with Harris surrogates suggesting MAGA women should voter for her in defiance of their domineering spouses.The 2024 campaign continues to plumb new depths with ugly sexist memes and doctored or misrepresented video clips having a free run on untethered social media. While Trump supporters have circulated images purporting to show Harris having loose morals, her supporters in turn have plied clips showing Trump as a degenerate. On Friday, liberal trolls shared a clip of Trump expressing frustration over a faulty mike at a rally in Milwaukee, alleging he was simulating a fellatio.Trump also flew into a rage after he was taunted by a former billionaire fanboy, Mark Cuban, who told a TV show that the MAGA supremo is intimidated by strong, intelligent women. He unloaded on Cuban, calling him a ""dumb guy"" ""weak"" ""insecure"" ""a major loser"" ""unattractive"" etc., in an extraordinarily tetchy social media rant.The Trump campaign later released testimonials from several women, including his former senior counselor Kellyanne Conway and Arkansas Governor, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, his former spokesperson, sharing why women support Trump and how he has empowered them. “He (Cuban) is very wrong, I surround myself with the strongest of women — With the understanding that ALL women are great, whether strong or not strong,” Trump wrote. There was no word from his wife Melania Trump or his daughter Ivanka, who have both been very scarce on the campaign trail.","Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes has opened an investigation into comments by MAGA supremo Donald Trump.

'Made me who I am today': Kamala Harris draws strength from mother's journey from India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/made-me-who-i-am-today-kamala-harris-draws-strength-from-mothers-journey-from-india/articleshow/114900452.cms,"US vice president and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris paid tribute to her late mother, Dr Shyamala Gopalan Harris , an Indian immigrant whose courage and dedication to her family continue to inspire her just days ahead of the November 5 elections. Harris reflected on the values her mother instilled in her, from honoring her heritage to championing causes that make a difference—a legacy she says drives her vision for America today.“My mother, Dr Shyamala Gopalan Harris, came to the United States from India alone at the age of 19,” Harris wrote in a post, sharing a cherished photo of her younger self alongside her mother. “Her courage and determination made me who I am today.”Through an op-ed in South Asian publication The Juggernaut, Harris recounted her family’s journey from India to America and the legacy of courage, sacrifice, and ambition that her mother instilled in her. The story of Shyamala, who arrived in the United States alone at 19 to pursue a graduate degree in California, is central to Harris’s own life and career.Growing up, Harris says she and her sister Maya were raised with a deep appreciation for their Indian heritage. Their mother made it a point to take them to India nearly every other year, especially during Diwali, a time filled with family gatherings and rituals. “Growing up, my mother raised my sister and me to appreciate and honor our heritage. Nearly every other year, we would go to India for Diwali. We would spend time with our grandparents, our uncles, and our chitthis,” Harris shared.She added, ""And as Vice President, it has been my honor to host Diwali celebrations in my home - the Vice President's Residence. Not only to celebrate the holiday, but to celebrate the rich history, culture, and heritage of the South Asian American diaspora, which is bound together by a shared sense of possibility and belief in the promise of America,""In her op-ed, Harris detailed the ambitions that drove her mother: to raise her daughters with integrity and to make strides in the fight against breast cancer. “My mother had two goals in her life: to raise her two daughters, my sister Maya and me, and to cure breast cancer,” Harris wrote.She fondly recalled trips to India as a child, particularly to visit her grandfather, PV Gopalan, a retired civil servant in Chennai (then Madras). Harris often joined him on long morning walks along the beach, where he spoke passionately about democracy, justice, and the importance of standing up for one’s beliefs. “Those lessons first inspired my interest in public service,” she wrote, noting that her grandfather’s influence continues to guide her today as both Vice President and presidential candidate.As Election Day came closer, Harris highlighted her commitment to ensuring healthcare equity for all Americans—a mission closely tied to her mother’s legacy as a cancer researcher and the struggles she endured battling cancer herself. “South Asian Americans are often overlooked by our healthcare system, especially with conditions like heart disease and diabetes,” Harris wrote.Addressing the issue of immigration, Harris articulated a vision for an immigration system that balances security with compassion. “I reject the false choice between securing our border and creating a system of immigration that is orderly and humane,” she wrote. Harris voiced support for a bipartisan border security bill aimed at curbing illegal crossings while also protecting immigrants, many of whom, she noted, come from communities like hers.On foreign policy, Harris drew a sharp contrast with her Republican opponent , Donald Trump, critiquing his record on diplomacy and commitment to US alliances. “As Vice President, I have expanded our relationships with key South Asian partners, including India,” she said. Unlike Trump, whom she described as “unfit” due to his connections with authoritarian leaders, Harris pledged to reinforce America’s alliances and uphold its leadership on the world stage.Harris’s mother Shyamala Gopalan arrived in California in the early 1960s, where she met Jamaican economist Donald Harris during the fervent days of the civil rights movement.Born in 1964, Kamala Harris grew up amid a climate of activism and social change, often attending marches with her mother. After her parents’ divorce, she was primarily raised by her mother, who worked long hours and kept a tight budget.Harris often recalls how her mother would sit late at night with a cup of tea, sorting through bills and ensuring that her daughters would have a future that was stable and fulfilling.","US Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris paid tribute to her late mother, Dr Shyamala Gopalan Harris.

So, whether Kamala Harris or Donald Trump win the US election, there will be no challenge for our relationship with the US.""Trump had recently characterised Bangladesh as being in a ""total state of chaos"", condemning the ""barbaric violence"" against minorities such as Hindus and Christians.

Trump emphasised his commitment to strengthening US-India relations in a recent Diwali message, stating, ""Under my administration, we will also strengthen our great partnership with India and my good friend PM Modi.""Alam clarified that Trump's remarks on Bangladeshi minorities stem from domestic politics influenced by lobbyists. Alam said Bangladesh's relationship with India is good and the interim govt wants to continue this good relationship.Additionally, Awami League will observe Nov 3 as ""Jail Killing Day"" in honour of the memory of four national leaders assassinated in 1975, a tragic event following the murder of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Commemorative wreaths will be placed at the graves of the leaders in Dhaka and Rajshahi, as announced on the party's Facebook page.Meanwhile, Transparency International Bangladesh's executive director, Iftekharuzzaman, highlighted the significant issue of money laundering, estimating that $12 billion to $15 billion is laundered annually from Bangladesh, primarily through trade-based methods, and emphasised the complexity in recovering these funds.","The interim govt maintains that the outcome of the US election poses no threat to its operations.

Ed Sheeran's 'Thinking Out Loud' prevails in copyright appeal over 'Let's Get It On',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ed-sheerans-thinking-out-loud-prevails-in-copyright-appeal-over-lets-get-it-on/articleshow/114899510.cms,"A federal appeals court Friday ruled that Ed Sheeran 's 2014 song ' Thinking Out Loud ' did not infringe on the copyright of Marvin Gaye's classic ' Let's Get It On .'In a 28-page decision, a three-judge panel from the US Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit in New York affirmed a lower court's ruling that the songwriting copyright in 'Let's Get It On' (1973) was limited to the skeletal sheet music that the song's publishers had deposited with the US Copyright Office. Additional musical elements in the song's recording - including guitar and drum parts, and its distinctive bass line - were therefore not protected by copyright, the judges found.They rejected arguments from Structured Asset Sales, a music investment company that owns an 11.1% interest in 'Let's Get It On,' that the song's four-chord pattern was original enough to have a copyright. Not only is it commonplace in many songs, the judges said, but the chords' ""selection and arrangement"" in a syncopated pattern was also not original.The appeal was being watched by copyright scholars, who have said the ""deposit copy"" rule, which limits protection for older works to what was written down, rather than what was recorded in a studio, had become out of step with how music has been made in the modern era. The rule was established by the 1909 Copyright Act.A key dispute had been whether the ""scope"" of the copyright in 'Let's Get It On' - exactly which parts of the song were protected by law - was defined by its written deposit copy or whether jurors could also consider additional elements from Gaye's recording. The district judge, citing a similar case involving Led Zeppelin's 'Stairway to Heaven,' ruled that only the written notes on the deposit copy were part of the copyright. Lawyers for Sheeran argued that the syncopated chord pattern of 'Thinking Out Loud' predated 'Let's Get It On' and was generic enough not to be protected by copyright.As the commercial recording of 'Let's Get It On' could not be played at trial, jurors heard an electronic ""realisation"" of the tune with robotic voice.","A federal appeals court Friday ruled that Ed Sheeran's 2014 song'Thinking Out Loud'did not infringe on the copyright of Marvin Gaye's classic'Let's Get It On.

Iron Beam: Israel's 'new era of warfare' defence system to use high-power lasers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/iron-beam-israels-new-era-of-warfare-defence-system-to-use-high-power-lasers/articleshow/114870623.cms,"How does 'Iron Beam' work?

Israel's advanced "" Iron Beam "" laser defense system is anticipated to be operational in the next year strengthening its defense system, reports CNN citing Israel’s defense ministry. Israel invested over $500 million this week in contracts with domestic defense companies Rafael Advanced Defense Systems and Elbit Systems to enhance the shield's production.The Iron Beam, developed alongside the Iron Dome, is designed to neutralize various aerial threats including missiles, drones, rockets, and mortars, according to Israel's defense ministry.Israeli officials have claimed that the development will bring a ""a new era of warfare"" as the nation confronts drone and missile threats from Iran and its allies.""It heralds the beginning of a new era in warfare. The initial capability of the ground-based laser system… is expected to enter operational service within one year,"" said Eyal Zamir, director general of the defense ministry, in a recent announcement.The system's prototype was first shown in 2021, and development has continued steadily since then.These developments occur as Israel maintains military operations in Gaza and Lebanon, following recent direct missile exchanges with Iran.Military analysts indicate that the Iron Beam could strengthen Israel's defensive capabilities while potentially reducing operational costs.A ground-based high-power laser system operates by targeting and heating vulnerable components of projectiles, such as engines or warheads, from distances ranging from hundreds of meters to several kilometers until they fail.This approach differs with Israel's current missile defense strategy, which relies on radar detection followed by launching interceptor missiles to neutralize incoming threats in the air.Defense experts indicate that a laser-based defense system would provide superior performance to the Iron Dome while being more cost-effective and responsive.According to Yehoshua Kalisky from the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv, each Iron Dome interception requires two missiles, with individual missiles costing approximately $50,000 or more.The ongoing conflict with Israel's northern neighbor has necessitated frequent interceptions. The IDF reported that on Tuesday alone, approximately 50 projectiles entered Israeli territory from southern Lebanon, with only partial interception success.The company developing Iron Beam, Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, said that laser interceptions have ""almost zero cost per interception.""Experts indicate that the laser system would particularly excel at countering drones, which have proven challenging for the Iron Dome to intercept.While the Iron Dome effectively counters rockets and missiles, it struggles with drones due to their small size, light weight, and minimal radar signature. Unlike missiles, drones can alter their flight paths and are harder for radar systems to detect.However, weather conditions pose significant limitations for the Iron Beam, as clouds, rain, and haze reduce its atmospheric penetration and target acquisition capabilities. The system also requires substantial power resources for operation.Various nations have developed different laser defense systems. The US Navy has tested high-powered lasers capable of destroying aircraft, while the UK has introduced DragonFire for aerial defense. According to the Pentagon, both China and Russia are working on satellite-targeting laser technology.Iran's status regarding indigenous laser defense systems remains uncertain. In 2022, Iranian state media reported the country's claimed ability to ""manufacture laser weapons to defend sensitive regions.""Reports suggest Iran may possess the Chinese-manufactured ""Silent Hunter"" laser weapon, though experts indicate it's less powerful than the planned Iron Beam system.","Israel's advanced "" Iron Beam "" laser defense system is anticipated to be operational in the next year strengthening its defense system.

Gold reserves play a crucial role in a nation’s financial stability, serving as a valuable asset for central banks and governments. These reserves, which refer to the stockpile of gold held by a country, help stabilise currency values and provide security during economic uncertainties. Historically, gold has been seen as a safe-haven asset, essential during times of crisis or financial downturns.For example, the U.S. began building its substantial reserves in the late 19th century and solidified its dominance through the Gold Reserve Act of 1934. Today, countries around the world hold significant amounts of gold as part of their strategic economic policies. Explore the top countries with the highest gold reserves, based on the latest data from the World Gold Council, showcasing their holdings and economic impact.The U.S. holds the highest gold reserves at approximately 8,133.46 tonnes, which make up about 72.41% of its total reserves. Stored in secure facilities like Fort Knox, these reserves bolster financial stability and reinforce the U.S. dollar's dominance in international trade.Germany ranks second with 3,351.53 tonnes, accounting for about 71.46% of its foreign reserves. Most of its gold is kept in vaults in Frankfurt and some repatriated from New York and London. Germany’s substantial holdings provide a buffer against financial crises and elevate its influence within the EU.Italy’s 2,451.84 tonnes of gold reserves, managed by its central bank, represent 68.33% of its total foreign reserves. These assets serve as a symbol of economic resilience, supporting Italy's stability within the Eurozone.France holds 2,436.97 tonnes, constituting 69.99% of its reserves. Managed by the Banque de France, these holdings provide financial security and reflect a longstanding strategy to mitigate economic risks.With 2,335.85 tonnes of gold, Russia has significantly increased its reserves as a strategic response to geopolitical challenges and to diversify away from the U.S. dollar. This approach strengthens its economic resilience.China’s 2,264.32 tonnes of gold, making up 4.91% of its reserves, demonstrate its gradual shift to diversify assets and reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar, supporting economic stability and policy flexibility.Japan’s gold holdings total 845.97 tonnes (5.15% of its reserves), used mainly as a hedge against economic volatility and inflation.India holds 840.76 tonnes, which account for 9.57% of its foreign reserves. Gold's cultural importance and the Reserve Bank of India's proactive strategies underline its value as a financial stabiliser.The Netherlands’ 612.45 tonnes (61.61% of its reserves) underscore its commitment to monetary stability, with most gold stored within national vaults.With 584.93 tonnes, Turkey has increased its reserves in recent years, now comprising a significant portion of its total foreign reserves. The nation’s growing mining potential could further bolster its economic position.","Gold reserves play a crucial role in a nation’s financial stability, serving as a valuable asset for central banks and governments.

ATLANTA: Kamala Harris on Saturday criticized House Speaker Mike Johnson for suggesting that Republicans might cut government subsidies for semiconductor manufacturing as she and Republican Donald Trump embarked on one last weekend quest to round up every possible vote in the battleground states that will determine the next president.""It is my plan and intention to continue to invest in American manufacturing,"" the Democratic nominee told reporters in Milwaukee, adding that Trump had lost manufacturing jobs during his presidency.Harris spoke before heading to campaign rallies in Atlanta and Charlotte, North Carolina. Trump was attending two rallies in North Carolina and one in Salem, Virginia, a state that isn't a battleground, after his late-night rally in Milwaukee.""We stand on the verge of the four greatest years in American history,"" Trump said in remarks released by his campaign before his first event, in Gastonia, North Carolina.President Joe Biden, who dropped out of the race this summer when it became clear he could not win, was doing his part for the Democrats, making one last 2024 campaign stop in Scranton, Pennsylvania.Harris' campaign released her closing ad pitch to the American people, a two-minute spot set to air Sunday during NFL games broadcast by CBS and FOX, including the Green Bay Packers against the Detroit Lions. The ad shows some of Harris' interactions with people during the campaign and has her looking directly into the camera and addressing voters.""Now I'm asking for your vote because as president I will get up every day and fight for the American people,"" she says at the end.Campaign manager Jen O'Mallely Dillon projected confidence on a conference call with reporters Saturday as both sides entered in the final sprint to get out the vote. ""If you can hear the joy in my voice it is because we are in GOTV weekend,"" she said.Johnson, R-La., later walked back his comments about cutting semiconductor subsidies, indicating he only meant that Republicans would ""streamline"" the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act. But Harris said Johnson had only issued the follow-up statement because ""their agenda is not popular.""The legislation has pumped billions of dollars into producing computer chips in the United States, supporting union jobs in battleground states such as Michigan.The vice presidential nominees and big name supporters also were out in force.Harris' running mate, Tim Walz, and actress Eva Longoria were joining a get-out-the-vote event in Las Vegas before the Minnesota governor flies to Arizona for events in Flagstaff and Tucson.

Before Harris had even left Milwaukee, supporters were lined up for her rally in Atlanta.Marzella and Darrell Pittman, who found out about the Atlanta rally on Friday, canceled their weekend plans and drove four hours from Alabama to attend.Marzella thinks Harris will win, but Darrell is nervous because many of the young Black men in his life support Trump and are hesitatant to vote for a woman for president.""It's tight, and the other side, they got a lot of our people believing in that side, just like we believe in Kamala,"" he said.Until the election, ""we have nothing but voting on our mind and we're talking to everybody,"" Marzella Pittman said.There is ""so much on the line"" and ""no way we can let this slip away,"" Darrell Pittman said.Carol Hicks, who drives around with a stack of Harris signs in her back seat, she said was optimistic because she has ""die-hard Republican coworkers"" who voted for Harris because they could not stomach voting for Trump.

As the United States nears the 2024 presidential election, candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are intensifying their campaigns in key battleground states, where outcomes remain uncertain, particularly in crucial swing states .The presidential election is scheduled for Tuesday, November 5, 2024.Federal elections take place on the first Tuesday of November, a date set in the early 19th century. Originally, states held elections on various days, but in 1845, a law was passed to unify the election day nationwide.Early November was chosen as it suited the predominantly agricultural society of the time—falling after the harvest yet with mild enough weather for travel.Catch comprehensive live coverage of the election results on TimesofIndia.com. You can stream the results on TOI’s YouTube channel and follow real-time updates on our website.Voting locations will commence operations between 7:00 am and 9:00 am local time across different states, which corresponds to 4:30 pm through 9:30 pm Indian Standard Time (IST), accounting for various US time zones, ALJAZEERA reported.Voting centres will conclude operations at different times, varying by state and county jurisdictions. The majority will finish between 6pm Eastern Time and midnight Eastern Time.Initial results should emerge shortly after the first polls close at 6pm Eastern Time (22:00 GMT). Later in November: It could take days for the election result to be known, especially if it is closed and mail-in ballots are a factor.If the contest between Harris and Trump proves close, the counting process could extend beyond election night, potentially requiring several days to determine the winner.New York Times :fivethirtyeight:Seven crucial swing states will likely determine the presidential outcome, comprising Pennsylvania (19 Electoral votes ), North Carolina (16), Georgia (16), Michigan (15), Arizona (11), Wisconsin (10), and Nevada (6), totalling 93 Electoral College votes.A successful candidate requires 270 of the available 538 Electoral votes.According to Newsmax political analyst Mark Halperin, Harris faces challenges in Georgia, North Carolina and Arizona. Halperin suggests Harris might secure Pennsylvania but could still lose the White House, particularly if Wisconsin proves unfavourable. Her position mirrors Joe Biden's situation before the debate.According to CNN reports, indeed, while improbable, it remains a possibility. One possible scenario for the 2024 election shows: If Harris secures Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona, Nevada and one electoral vote from Nebraska - states previously won by Joe Biden in 2020 - but loses Pennsylvania and Georgia, the result would be a 269-269 deadlock. Additional tied-election scenarios are available on the 270 to Win website.In case of a 269-269 tie, or if a third-party or independent candidate secures electoral votes preventing any candidate from achieving the required 270 Electoral College majority, the situation proceeds to a ""contingent election"".During a contingent election, the US House of Representatives determines the winner. Each state's House delegation receives one vote, and victory requires a majority of state delegation votes.The 12th Amendment, established following the contentious 1800 election, stipulates that if no candidate achieves an Electoral College majority, the newly inaugurated Congress (sworn in on January 3) selects the president, whilst the Senate chooses the vice president.Indian-American Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi weighed in on the major influence that Indian Americans can have in the upcoming US presidential elections . He said that their votes might determine the election results both in key states and nationwide.He told ANI, ""The community is looking for practical problem-solving leaders, people who put ideology aside and are principled about making sure that everyone can enjoy the American dream as long as they work hard, play by the rules and try to help their country.""","The presidential election is scheduled for Tuesday, November 5, 2024.

For the latest updates, check out our comprehensive guide on the US Election:

As Americans prepare to head to the polls on November 5, the 2024 presidential race between Democratic nominee Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump has reached a fever pitch. Both candidates are locked in a tense battle for the White House, with opinion polls showing a tight race in the seven crucial swing states likely to decide the outcome. With over 72 million Americans casting early votes, the stage is set for one of the most dramatic election results in modern US history. Yet, the final outcome may not be known for days, sparking anticipation and uncertainty across the nation.On Election Day, voting will close at different times depending on the state, and the counting of votes will commence immediately. Typically, major news networks and agencies like the Associated Press rely on their data models to “call” each state’s result soon after polls close. However, with millions of early and mail-in ballots, many of which will need additional time to process, the full picture may not emerge on election night. If either candidate wins the pivotal 270 Electoral College votes on November 5 or shortly thereafter, the winner might be projected, but this year’s election is expected to stretch into the following days.Seven battleground states—Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Nevada, Wisconsin, and North Carolina—will play a decisive role in the race’s outcome. These states carry considerable weight in the Electoral College and were narrowly split in the 2020 election. For Trump, regaining these states is essential, while Harris aims to hold onto these Democratic strongholds to secure her place in the White House. States like Florida and Ohio, which have trended Republican in recent elections, may also influence the final result, but the swing states are where both campaigns have concentrated their final efforts.Unlike traditional voting methods, processing mail-in ballots and early votes can extend counting by several days. Each state has different rules on when and how to process these ballots, and closely contested states are likely to witness a more prolonged counting period. In 2020, for instance, the result took four days to be called, as Pennsylvania’s vote tally played a decisive role. Given the expected high turnout and close race, election experts caution that this year may similarly require patience.Adding to the complexity, Trump has already questioned the integrity of the election process, particularly in swing states, casting doubts on mail-in ballots and early votes. He has suggested he may contest the results if they do not favour him, which could lead to further delays or legal disputes in the aftermath of the election.Once individual states have certified their results—typically by mid-to-late November or early December—the Electoral College will formally cast its votes, with Congress scheduled to declare the final outcome on January 6, 2025. However, public perception of the winner often comes earlier, once the 270-vote threshold is reached.","The 2024 presidential race between Democratic nominee Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump has reached a fever pitch.

MAGA meltdown over Indians stealing jobs as racial abuse mounts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/maga-meltdown-over-indians-stealing-jobs-as-racial-abuse-mounts/articleshow/114888886.cms,"(Reuters file photo)

TOI Correspondent from Washington:

Cherrypicking data from the latest Bureau of Labor Statistics jobs report during a heated election campaign, some pro-Trump economists and the MAGA media are alleging foreign-born workers are scoring ""nearly all job gains"" at the expense of native-born Americans amid a toxic undercurrent of resentment and racial abuse of Indian tech community .“Over the last year, native-born Americans have lost almost 800,000 jobs while foreign-born workers have gained over 1 million jobs; the US labor market is turning into a temp agency for foreign workers and govt bureaucrats,” Heritage Foundation Economist E J Antoni wrote in a post on X that some MAGA activists portrayed as part of the ""great replacement theory"" to sideline native-born Americans with immigrants.According to Antoni's reading of the report, native-born Americans have fewer jobs today than before the pandemic (-873k), while all net job growth has gone to foreign-born workers (+3.7 million). ""Many Americans aren't happy w/ the economy b/c they're not the ones w/ the jobs,"" he wrote.But the October jobs report actually shows employment rose for native-born workers and fell for foreign-born workers during the month, although over the past year, employment has fallen by 773,000 for native workers and risen by 1 million for the foreign-born.The MAGA media, notably Breitbart Report , which has long carried on a crusade against foreign skilled workers, particularly H1B visa holders from India, segued the analysis into Trump's recent comment -- “So foreigners coming in illegally, largely illegally into our country, took the jobs of native-born Americans and I’ve been telling you that’s what’s going to happen"" -- to argue that all immigrants are taking jobs that could and should go to native-born Americans.It cited a Pew Research Center study that found that as of 2022, more than 30 million legal immigrants and illegal aliens were holding US jobs — a 20-percent increase over the last 15 years -- which incidentally also includes four Trump years. During the same period, the number of native-born Americans who have been added to the workforce increased by less than 10 percent, taking the native-born work force to 130.8 million.The tirade against foreign workers, illegal or legal, comes amid intense trolling on social media of Indian and Indian-origin tech workers and executives, even if they are US citizens. Over the weekend, Sheel Mohnot, a San Francisco fintech executive, posted a screenshot of comments his recent post on a mostly Patel-run bank in Texas attracted. They included ""They all go back to India next year,"" ""All need to be deported back to their shithole,"" ""We will seize all their assets and send them all back to Gujarat"" and ""I can only imagine how their office smells.""Not everyone joined the verbal lynchmob. Several Americans defended Mohnot. ""f*** em. hit them with the haymaker,"" one of them wrote, with a data-chart that showed Indian-Americans with the highest median household income in the US ($100,500), almost double that of white-Americans ($ 59,900). Indian-Americans also have the highest percentage of bachelor's degree holders -- 70 percent compared to the national average of 28 percent.","Some pro-Trump economists and the MAGA media are alleging foreign-born workers are scoring ""nearly all job gains"" at the expense of native-born Americans.

Preventive Detention: Pakistan introduces bill for preventive detention of terror suspects,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-introduces-bill-for-preventive-detention-of-terror-suspects/articleshow/114876705.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: ANI)

ISLAMABAD: In a pivotal legislative move, the Pakistani government introduced a bill on Friday that seeks to authorise military and civil armed forces to detain individuals charged with terrorism for up to three months under a system of "" preventive detention .""This bill, which amends the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) of 1997, was tabled by law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar in a session of the National Assembly that saw limited attendance and was quickly referred to the relevant committee for further consideration, Dawn reported.The proposed legislation includes measures for forming Joint Investigation Teams (JITs) made up of various law enforcement and intelligence agency members to conduct inquiries into terrorism-related cases.These amendments to Clause 11EEEE of the ATA were initially enacted following the tragic Army Public School attack in Peshawar but lapsed a decade ago due to a sunset clause.As outlined in the bill's Statement of Objects and Reasons, the ""erstwhile amendments of Section 11EEEE of the Act are required to be re-inserted to empower the government, armed forces and civil armed forces with the necessary authority to detain individuals who pose a significant threat to national security.""The new provisions would allow preventive detention based on credible information or reasonable suspicion, enabling authorities to intervene before potential terrorist acts can be carried out, reported Dawn.Furthermore, the bill aims to strengthen the legal framework for law enforcement agencies to conduct more effective operations against terrorism. It will facilitate the formation of JITs to conduct thorough inquiries and gather actionable intelligence.According to the bill, Section 11EEEE was amended in 2014 to allow the government and authorised military and civil forces to detain individuals suspected of terrorism-related activities, but its validity expired in 2016 due to a sunset clause.The proposed amendment states: ""The government or, where the provisions of Section 4 have been invoked, the armed forces or civil armed forces, as the case may be, subject to the specific or general order of the government in this regard, for a period not exceeding three months and after recording reasons thereof, issue order for the preventive detention of any person who has been concerned in any offence under this Act relating to the security or defence of Pakistan or any part thereof, or public order relating to target killing, kidnapping for ransom, and extortion, bhatta or the maintenance of supplies or services, or against whom a reasonable complaint has been made or credible information has been received, or a reasonable suspicion exists of his having been so concerned, for purpose of inquiry.""Additionally, the amendment specifies that the detention of such persons, including any extensions beyond three months, will adhere to Article 10 of the Constitution. A new provision mandates that if an armed forces-issued detention order is made, the inquiry will involve a JIT, including a police officer of at least superintendent rank and members from various intelligence agencies.These new provisions will remain valid for two years following the commencement of the ATA (Amendment) Act, 2024.In related parliamentary discussions, speaker Ayaz Sadiq warned he would summon meetings of seven standing committees to elect chairpersons if the opposition Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party does not provide nominations by next week. The issue was raised after criticism of government ministers' absence during a question hour, Dawn reported.Law minister Tarar also addressed concerns regarding the placement of several opposition lawmakers on the Exit Control List (ECL), indicating that names are added due to absconding in criminal cases. He encouraged opposition members to formally submit requests for review, stating that 65 to 70 per cent of ECL removal requests are typically accepted.The National Assembly is scheduled to reconvene on Monday evening.","Pakistani government introduces bill to authorise military and civil armed forces to detain individuals charged with terrorism for up to three months.

ISLAMABAD: At least seven people, including five schoolchildren and a police constable, were killed and more than 20 others injured in a roadside bomb explosion in Mastung district of Pakistan ’s southwestern Balochistan province on Friday.State-run PTV news quoted Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif as saying that the explosion had occurred at a “girls’ high school”, while another post by the outlet said the incident occurred “near girls’ high school chowk”.Naeem Bazai, commissioner for Kalat division, said the attack had occurred near Mastung’s civil hospital, a few metres from the girls’ school.Officials said the blast resulted from an improvised explosive device (IED) fitted inside a motorcycle parked outside a mechanic’s shop. “The IED exploded when a police mobile and a school van were crossing the blast site,” said Mastung district deputy commissioner Baz Muhammad Marri.“Seven people, including a cop and five minor children, were killed and 22 others injured in the explosion,” Marri told the media. “We are ascertaining who was actually targeted because a police mobile and a school van were both passing by the area,” he added.Sarfaraz Bugti, Balochistan’s chief minister, condemned the attack and expressed grief over the loss of lives. “The terrorists have targeted innocent children. We will hold accountable, the perpetrators of the blast,” he said in a statement.Waseem Baig, a spokesman for the Balochistan health department, said 11 injured, including two children, had been shifted to a trauma centre in Quetta, the provincial capital. “Three injured are in critical condition,” he added.Balochistan, Pakistan’s largest province by area, has been facing grave security conditions since the country launched a military offensive there in 2006, vowing to wipe out so-called traitors and terrorists.At least 20 labourers were killed in a rocket attack in October on coal mines in the province’s Duki district. The incident had prompted more than 40,000 other labourers to return to their native areas in Punjab and Sindh. Several workers were killed in Sept when armed men stormed an under-construction house in Panjgur. All slain labourers hailed from Multan, Punjab province.The volatile situation in Balochistan has also been a major challenge for Beijing to complete projects linked to the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative. Chinese nationals, mostly working on CPEC projects, are often targeted by militants in the province.","At least seven people, including five schoolchildren and a police constable, were killed and more than 20 others injured in a roadside bomb explosion in Mastung district of Pakistan ’s southwestern Balochistan province.

Your country is the only exception,"" Dar said, quoting Chinese authorities as telling their Pakistani counterparts at recent meetings.He was speaking at a seminar this week organised by the Pakistan-China Institute, an independent Islamabad-based think tank.Chinese envoy Jiang Zaidong, who was at the event, stood up to contradict Dar. ""The security of Chinese citizens is paramount for President Xi (Jinping),"" he said, adding that Beijing iterated its priorities during Xi's discussions with the Pakistan govt during his recent visit to the country.He warned that violence targeting Chinese nationals was causing a rethink on Beijing's investments under its Belt and Road Initiative(BRI). The diplomat stressed the need for Islamabad to take effective remedial measures to prevent the recurrence of such acts of terror acts.In an official response Thursday, Pakistan's foreign office spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch termed the Chinese ambassador's statement ""perplexing"" and a stark departure from longstanding diplomatic norms governing bilateral ties.The Chinese officials seldom chastise Islamabad for alleged security failings involving Chinese engineers and workers, and Pakistan’s public response to China’s criticism is also unprecedented. However, Beijing’s security concerns have been heightened by the recent increase in violence against Chinese people.Earlier this month, two Chinese citizens were killed and 10 others wounded in a suicide attack near Karachi airport for which the outlawed Balochistan Liberation Army later owned responsibility.In March, five Chinese engineers died in a suicide bombing in the Besham region of the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.Twenty-one Chinese workers have been killed in Pakistan since the countries launched the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor project a decade ago.","China finds it ""unacceptable"" that its citizens have been targeted by terrorists in Pakistan twice in six months.

SINDH: Amnesty International has condemned the suffering of thousands of Sindhis who are affected due to severe flooding and a surge in water-borne diseases in the backdrop of the Pakistan government's inaction, according to the rights group statement.Following major flooding in August 2024, more than 140,000 people were displaced with many now living in tents. Months later, affected communities are still struggling with health risks and lost livelihoods compounded by little international or government support.With disease rampant due to stagnant floodwaters, older people, children and pregnant women are at increased risk of illness and death.Amnesty said that the Sindh government has failed to guarantee essential services such as healthcare, food, and housing. This has led to the violation of economic, social, and cultural rights as outlined by the international human rights ratified by Pakistan, the statement said.Scott Edwards, Crisis Response Programme Director at Amnesty International, stated, ""Tens of thousands of people have been abandoned by the Sindh government and the international community after being devastated again by major floods. Many impacted communities were harmed by record-breaking floods in 2022 and have struggled to rebuild their lives.""Edwards emphasized the urgency of addressing climate changeand its humanitarian impacts, calling for immediate action from both the international community and Pakistauthorities. ""Climate change is not a tentative threat; lives are being lost today to global inaction and inadequate humanitarian response,"" he said.Shazia Chandio lost her son during the floods, she told Amnesty International, for one day and one night he was suffering diarrhoea, and then the next day he died."" She further expressed her sorrow and said, ""Nobody has helped. Those who have money here move to a safer place, but those who don't have money stay.""In September 2024, Amnesty International visited eight flood-affected villages in the Badin and Dadu districts of Sindh. They interviewed 36 residents including groups such as older adults, people with disabilities, and children. The organisation urged people to support the people who suffered due to flooding.","Amnesty International has condemned the suffering of thousands of Sindhis who are affected due to severe flooding.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan began a nationwide vaccination campaign Monday to protect 45 million children from polio after a surge in new cases that has hampered years of efforts to stop the disease in one of the two countries where it has never been eradicated.Pakistan regularly launches such campaigns, but violence targeting the health workers and police assigned to escort them is common. Militants falsely claim the vaccination campaigns are a Western conspiracy to sterilize children.The campaign is the third this year and will continue until Sunday ""in response to the alarming increase in polio cases,"" said Ayesha Raza Farooq , the prime minister's adviser for the polio eradication program. ""We are re-energized in our efforts to combat polio,"" she said in a statement.During the door-to-door campaign, children younger than 5 will be vaccinated and given drops of Vitamin A supplements to enhance their immunity.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif recently met with front-line health workers, urging them to ensure no child was left unvaccinated by going door-to-door.Anwarul Haq, who is the coordinator of the National Emergency Operations Centre for Polio Eradication, also urged parents to fully cooperate with polio workers. ""Polio has no cure, but it can be prevented with this readily available vaccine,"" he said.Pakistan has recorded 41 cases across 71 districts so far this year, Farooq said. Most were reported from southwestern Balochistan and southern Sindh province, following by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and eastern Punjab province.The surge in cases in new locations is worrying authorities since previous cases were from the restive northwest bordering Afghanistan, where the Taliban government in September suddenly stopped a door-to-door vaccination campaign.Authorities in Pakistan say the Afghan Taliban's recent decision to stop door-to-door anti-polio campaign will have repercussions beyond the Afghan border, as people from both sides frequently travel to each other's country. The World Health Organization has confirmed 18 polio cases in Afghanistan this year.Pakistan and Afghanistan are the only two countries in the world where the spread of polio has never been stopped. It is one of the world's most infectious diseases, so it continues to spread anywhere people are not fully vaccinated.

I have witnessed the atrocities against them—their temples, businesses, and homes,"" Hindu civic leader Charu Chandra Das Brahmachari told news agency AFP.The interim administration under Muhammad Yunus has recognized and condemned these incidents against Hindus, while maintaining that many of the attacks were politically rather than religiously motivated.Continuous demonstrations since then indicate ongoing attacks and demand action from Yunus's administration, which serves as an ""advisory council"" responsible for implementing democratic reforms and organizing new elections.Recent tensions escalated when sedition charges were filed against 19 individuals who participated in an earlier minority rights demonstration in Chittagong.Authorities accused these individuals of disrespectingBangladesh 's national flag by positioning a saffron flag—the symbolic color of Hinduism—above it.""Framing our leaders with false charges, like sedition, has made us skeptical of the government's intentions,"" said protest member Chiranjan Goswami.In predominantly Muslim Bangladesh, Hindus constitute the largest minority religious group, representing approximately eight percent of the population.Reports also indicate attacks on Sufi shrines, with Islamist groups suspected of targeting alternative Islamic practices.Saturday's protest followed a larger gathering in Chittagong the previous day, which drew 10,000 participants.Minority community leaders have announced plans for additional demonstrations in the coming weeks.In August, Hasina, aged 77, departed by helicopter to India as protesters filled Dhaka's streets, marking a dramatic conclusion to her authoritarian leadership.Her administration faced accusations of extensive human rights violations, including extrajudicial killings of thousands of political opponents during her 15-year tenure.","Demonstrators call on interim government to establish legislation protecting minorities.

Minority Hindus gathered in large numbers on Friday to protest in Bangladesh , with approximately 30,000 demonstrating in Chattogram under police and military protection. Similar demonstrations occurred across the country as Hindus sought protection from attacks and demanded the withdrawal of sedition cases against their community leaders, as reported by AP.Hindu groups reported an increase in attacks since early August, following the ousting of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina after a student-led uprising. Nobel peace laureate Muhammad Yunus , who leads the interim government, says the reported figures are exaggerated.Hindus, who constitute about 8% of Bangladesh’s population of nearly 170 million, claim they have experienced over 2,000 attacks since August 4. They believe the interim government is not offering adequate protection, and they fear the growing influence of hardline Islamists.Activists continue advocating for minority protection laws, a dedicated ministry, and other demands including extended holiday periods for religious festivals.The Chattogram protest was organised quickly after sedition charges were filed against 19 Hindu leaders on Wednesday, including priest Chandan Kumar Dhar. This was related to an October 25 rally in which a group allegedly placed a saffron flag above the Bangladesh flag, considered disrespectful. Two leaders were arrested, causing anger in the Hindu community.Leaders claim these charges are politically motivated and are demanding their withdrawal within 72 hours. Another rally is scheduled for Saturday in Dhaka.Supporters of Hasina's Awami League party and ally Jatiya Party also report being targeted since Hasina's removal. The Jatiya Party headquarters was vandalized and set on fire on Thursday. Jatiya Chairman G M Quader stated, “We will continue to hold rallies and demand our rights. We are not afraid to risk our lives.” The party plans a rally in Dhaka on Saturday to protest rising commodity prices and what they describe as false charges against their leaders.","Hindus claim they have experienced over 2,000 attacks since August 4.

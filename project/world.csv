Coup-case turn: Ex-Brazil president Bolsonaro says 'hallucinations' led to ankle-monitor tampering; denies escape attempt,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/coup-case-turn-ex-brazil-president-bolsonaro-says-hallucinations-led-to-ankle-monitor-tampering-denies-escape-attempt/articleshow/125529851.cms,"Photo credit: AP





His claim comes a day after his arrest in Brasília, as the Supreme Court prepares to vote Monday on whether to uphold his pre-emptive detention, reported AP.Bolsonaro was detained early Saturday after security officials detected that his device had been tampered with shortly after midnight. Justice Alexandre de Moraes authorised the arrest, citing fears the former leader might try to flee to a foreign embassy ahead of beginning the 27-year sentence he received in September for plotting to overturn the 2022 election. According to The Guardian, the 70-year-old denied he had been planning to flee his rented mansion, where he has been under house arrest since August.At the hearing, assistant judge Luciana Sorrentino said Bolsonaro reported suffering hallucinations and paranoia after starting a strong painkiller and an antidepressant. According to a Supreme Court document cited by AP, he said he believed the monitor contained “some wire tap” and tried to uncover it. He also said he did “not remember having a breakdown of this magnitude before.”Before offering the explanation about a psychotic episode, Bolsonaro had initially told officials he had tried to open the monitor because he wanted to inspect it, footage showed, using a soldering iron that left the device’s cap heavily damaged.He insisted he was not attempting to escape and said the episode occurred late at home while his daughter, elder brother and an aide were present. He claimed he stopped tampering around midnight.Political observers and foes have questioned his shifting account, especially as footage shows Bolsonaro telling a security official he had interfered with the device earlier.Federal police executed the arrest order around 6 am on Saturday and transferred Bolsonaro to a federal police base, where he remains held. He has been under house arrest since August.Bolsonaro’s lawyers again asked that he be returned to house arrest on health grounds, a request De Moraes has repeatedly rejected. The justice, however, did authorise a visit from former first lady Michelle Bolsonaro.Bolsonaro’s detention comes days before he was expected to begin serving the 27-year, three-month sentence for attempting to block Lula from taking office. Although convicted, he had not yet received a final arrest warrant while some appeals were pending. He remains barred from running for public office until 2030.","Bolsonaro was detained early Saturday after security officials detected that his device had been tampered with shortly after midnight.

TikTok star's Father says he wants “pop smoke braids” for Girlalala





Girlalala, whose real name was Maurice Harrison, was a well-known 21-year-old Black transgender TikTok creator from Lauderdale Lakes, Florida. She had many followers online and was loved for her bright smile and fun hair videos. She was shot and killed on November 15, 2025, during a fight with her boyfriend, 25-year-old Shanoyd Whyte Jr. After her death, a new family fight began. This fight is not about the case or the police report. It is about how Girlalala should look at her funeral.Her father posted videos on Instagram. In his video, he said he was angry that some people wanted to bury his child with a wig. He said he would not go to the funeral if she was shown that way. His words spread fast online. Many people began talking about respect, gender identity, family choices, and how a loved one should be honored after death. Fans, friends, and LGBTQ+ groups shared their thoughts as the story grew across social media.In his video, Girlalala’s father spoke with strong emotion. He said people were “doing this for the show” and not thinking about his child. He said he loved Girlalala but did not want the funeral to show her in a way that went against “how God gave him.”Because of this, he said he would not attend if she was buried wearing a wig.He added that the public viewing would still be open. Fans could come and say goodbye. But he repeated that he would not join the funeral if a wig was used. He said, “Put my son in some pop smoke braids with a short tape or an afro for the last time.”His comments brought strong reactions. Many LGBTQ+ advocates said that honoring a person’s gender identity after death is very important. They said Girlalala lived proudly as a transgender woman and should be remembered in the same way. Others said families often struggle with grief and identity at the same time.Police records say Shanoyd Whyte Jr. waved down deputies near the scene and showed them the car where Girlalala was found with many gunshot wounds. She was unresponsive. Officers later saw surveillance video of Shanoyd Whyte holding what looked like a gun. He has now been charged with first-degree murder.Also Read: Girlalala Cause Of Death: How Did The TikTok Star Die At Just 21","Girlalala, whose real name was Maurice Harrison, was a well-known Black transgender TikTok creator from Lauderdale Lakes, Florida.

Candace Owens On Feminism, Zionism, Who Assassinated Charlie Kirk?





Candace Owens claims Charlie Kirk sent a very scary text message the day before he died. She says Charlie Kirk told a Turning Point USA worker, “They are going to kill me.” She said this message was sent just one day before he was shot on September 10 at an event in Utah. Candace Owens spoke about this on the Myron Gaines podcast, where she made many strong claims about what she thinks happened.She said she does not like the silence from people inside Turning Point USA and believes someone is hiding something. Owens also said Charlie Kirk’s views were changing right before his death and that things around him felt tense. She says he told Tucker Carlson to “go max,” and she believes many people around him were upset about it. Her statements have now created a big debate online.On the podcast, Myron Gaines asked Candace Owens who she thought was “most responsible” for what happened to Charlie Kirk. She said his death did not feel simple and that she believed something bigger was happening. Owens said that one Turning Point USA staff member has the text message from Kirk where he wrote, “They are going to kill me.”She said this message was not about the trans lobby. She did not name the person who received the text.She said she did not understand why the staff member never shared the warning with the public.Candace Owens also said she did not like how Turning Point USA was acting after Kirk’s death. She said it felt strange and did not match how close people said they were to Kirk. She said Charlie Kirk knew he would die young and believed she would be the one to speak up for him.Owens then said she believes Charlie Kirk’s killing was a “military hit.” She said she does not know who ordered it but feels sure it looked like a planned attack. She also said she sees what she calls “faith infiltration” inside Turning Point USA. She believes some people got close to Kirk on purpose.Candace Owens also claimed that an Egyptian military plane was sitting at an airport near the event on the day Kirk was shot. She said the plane did not move and was “known to” Turning Point USA. She suggested this looked unusual.Also Read: Candace Owens raises heat while claiming Erika Kirk is on autopilot and holds no verifiable lies after Charlie Kirk was killed","Candace Owens claims Charlie Kirk sent a very scary text message the day before he died.

Xi 'Teases' Japan On War: Chinese Cutters Storm Into Taiwan Waters For Showdown | 'GO AWAY ELSE...'





Japan’s defence minister Shinjiro Koizumi on Sunday announced plans to deploy surface-to-air missiles on the country’s westernmost island of Yonaguni remain on schedule, emphasising that the move aimed to reinforce deterrence rather than raise regional tensions.His remarks came during a visit to the strategically located base, 110 km east of Taiwan, amid continued sparring between Tokyo and Beijing over security issues linked to the island and as diplomatic friction lingers over prime minister Sanae Takaichi’s recent Taiwan-related comments, The Japan Times reported.“The deployment can help lower the chance of an armed attack on our country,” Koizumi told reporters as he inspected the Yonaguni base. “The view that it will heighten regional tensions is not accurate.”Tokyo is pressing ahead with stationing medium-range surface-to-air missiles on Yonaguni as part of a broader military build-up across Japan’s southern island chain, reflecting its deepening concerns over China’s expanding military reach and the risk of a Taiwan contingency. Those concerns have been sharpened by a diplomatic row triggered by Takaichi’s remarks suggesting Japan could theoretically cooperate with other nations militarily if China attacked Taiwan — comments that drew a sharp rebuke and economic retaliation from Beijing, Bloomberg reported.Before arriving on the island, the minister toured bases on Ishigaki and Miyako — key nodes in Japan’s defence posture. Ishigaki hosts anti-ship missiles, while Miyako houses air-surveillance units and ammunition facilities. Further east, Okinawa contains major Japanese and US military installations.Yonaguni marks the western end of the Ryukyu island chain. As regional tensions have risen, Chinese state-controlled media have published articles questioning Japan’s sovereignty over the islands by citing the historic Ryukyu kingdom’s past independence. While few residents of Okinawa Prefecture seek independence today, many remain wary of being drawn into a conflict if military sites on the islands become targets.Despite being a popular diving destination, Yonaguni is a vital surveillance hub, equipped with radar that monitors nearby seas and airspace, as well as an electronic-warfare unit introduced in 2024 to disrupt enemy communications and guidance systems. In recent weeks, the US military conducted an exercise moving supplies from Okinawa to Yonaguni to simulate establishing a forward-operating base during a crisis. Koizumi refused to comment on the potential impact on Yonaguni in such a scenario, saying he would not address “hypothetical” situations.The island’s vulnerability was underscored in 2022 when China, responding to then US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan, launched military drills that saw ballistic missiles land just south of Yonaguni.Meeting the island’s mayor, Koizumi said Japan must continue strengthening its Self-Defence Forces while deepening coordination with the US. “Today, Japan faces the most severe and complex security environment since the end of World War II,” he said. “To protect the peaceful livelihoods of the Japanese people — including everyone here on Yonaguni — we must strengthen the Self-Defense Forces’ capabilities.""","Defence minister Shinjiro Koizumi says plans to deploy surface-to-air missiles on Yonaguni remain on schedule.

Nina Lin gives a short apology but continues her stream and even makes small jokes to the chat when the mother leaves. People in the salon later say the place felt tense after the exchange.At the same time, RayAsianBoy’s announcement about Nina Lin joining his upcoming stream was already getting mixed reactions.

Morning fog and safety alerts

Cloudy and dusty conditions





Slight temperature drop









Fog thickened over parts of Abu Dhabi and extended into Dubai early on Friday, creating challenging conditions on the roads and slowing visibility to under a kilometre in several spots. Alongside the fog, cooler air, shifting clouds and light dust defined the morning atmosphere, forming a mix of weather elements that led UAE authorities to issue safety alerts and advise motorists to drive with extra care through the first half of the day.Dense fog settled over several parts of Abu Dhabi and extended into areas of Dubai early on November 21, sharply reducing visibility for motorists. The National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) issued red and yellow alerts to signal varying levels of fog intensity, cautioning that visibility could dip below 1,000 metres in affected coastal and inland zones.Authorities reinforced the warnings with an advisory urging drivers to slow down, maintain safe distances, and remain alert on the roads. The alerts were placed in effect until 10:30am, the window during which fog and mist were expected to persist.Alongside the fog, the NCM noted that the day would bring partly cloudy skies with occasional dust, particularly in open areas. Low clouds were forecast to form westward over the sea and islands, contributing to changing visibility and muted daylight during the early hours.These cloud formations were expected to shift gradually as the day progressed.Friday also marked a modest decline in temperatures, most noticeable along the coastal stretches. The cooler shift accompanied the fog and cloud cover, creating milder conditions compared to previous days. The temperature dip, though slight, aligned with a broader trend of seasonal transition across the region.","Dense winter fog blanketed Abu Dhabi and Dubai, reducing visibility below 1,000 metres.

‘THIS IS VIOLENCE’: Global Backlash As Brazil Opens Amazon To Oil Drilling On COP30 Eve





A fire broke out at the COP30 climate summit in Belem, Brazil, on Thursday, forcing thousands of delegates to evacuate and halting negotiations at a critical moment in the two-week conference.Ironically, the blaze appears to have been caused by electrical equipment, likely a microwave — showing that even a summit dedicated to climate action doesn’t always follow its own rules.The blaze began around 2.00 pm (1700 GMT) in an exhibition pavilion. Security footage later showed flames racing up an internal fabric shell lining the walls and ceiling, burning a hole through the roof as smoke filled the corridors and people ran for the exits shouting “fire!”Firefighters said the incident was brought under control within six minutes. Nineteen people were treated for smoke inhalation and two for anxiety, according to the Brazilian presidency of the event.Firefighters and ambulances arrived with sirens blaring as smoke rose from the tents and permanent buildings hosting diplomats, journalists, and activists. The affected area was sealed off with a large sheet, and delegates were escorted in one by one to retrieve belongings, including passports needed for evening flights.Plenary sessions will not resume until Friday.It was the third major incident since the summit began last week, following peaceful demonstrations by Indigenous protesters who first stormed the venue and later blockaded the entrance. COP30 hosts Brazil and United Nations Climate Change said in a joint statement that security responded “swiftly” and the blaze was controlled quickly.After a fire department inspection, Brazil declared the site reopened at 8.40 pm.The disruption hit at a delicate stage in the negotiations, with ministers struggling to break a deadlock over fossil fuels, climate finance, and trade measures. Delegates remain divided over Brazil’s proposed “roadmap” to transition away from fossil fuels, as well as concerns about weak emissions-reduction plans and funding for developing nations.Earlier in the day, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned negotiators that “the world is watching” and urged them to reach an “ambitious compromise.” He also welcomed calls for clarity on the disputed issue of weaning the world off fossil fuels.With less than 24 hours before the summit’s scheduled end, nearly 200 countries are still working to reach consensus. Brazil has described securing a final deal as vital to accelerating global climate action and turning years of promises into meaningful progress.","A fire broke out at the COP30 climate summit in Belem, Brazil, on Thursday, forcing thousands of delegates to evacuate.

The quake, which shook buildings in Dhaka and sent residents fleeing outdoors, was felt across several parts of the country and in neighbouring regions of India including Kolkata.Also read: West Bengal: Strong tremors jolt Kolkata; no damage reported yet The US Geological Survey said the earthquake occurred at 10:38 am, with the epicentre located in the Ghorashal area of Narsingdi district, about 25 kilometres from Dhaka, at a depth of 10 kilometres. Dhaka-based DBC Television reported that six people died in the capital, including three who were killed when a roof and a wall collapsed, and three pedestrians who were struck by falling building railings.Authorities said the tremors caused significant panic in Dhaka, one of the world’s most densely populated cities with more than 30,000 people per square kilometre. Bangladesh’s central region is typically less seismically active than the north and southeast, where interactions between the India and Eurasia plates make earthquakes more common.A separate update from ANI said a 5.5-magnitude quake near Narsingdi was felt widely across Dhaka around 10:40 am and also in parts of India including West Bengal and areas of the northeast.The USGS recorded the event at 10:08 am IST. As per the ANI report, “There have been no reports of casualties or damage so far,” though later official updates confirmed fatalities in the capital.Last month, Bangladesh recorded a magnitude 3.4 earthquake, according to the National Centre for Seismology. Experts note that shallow earthquakes can produce stronger surface shaking because seismic waves travel a shorter distance.Citing USGS figures, The Daily Star reported that a magnitude 4.0 earthquake releases energy equivalent to about 6 tons of TNT, while a magnitude 5.0 quake corresponds to around 200 tons. The energy rises steeply with each magnitude, with a 7.0 quake equalling nearly 199,000 tons of TNT and a 9.0 quake releasing about 99 million tons, comparable to roughly 25,000 nuclear bombs.Bangladesh sits at the junction of the Indian, Eurasian and Burma plates, which move several centimetres each year. The country is intersected by major faults including the Bogura, Tripura, Shillong Plateau, Dauki and Assam faults, placing it within 13 recognised earthquake-prone zones. Regions such as Chattogram, the Chattogram Hill Tracts and Jaintiapur in Sylhet fall within the highest-risk category.Visuals from Dhaka on Friday showed emergency teams assessing damage as authorities monitored aftershocks and structural impacts across the capital.(With inputs from AP and ANI)","A 5.5-magnitude earthquake struck central Bangladesh on Friday, killing at least six people.

'Boycott politics never work': South Africa President reacts to Trump's no-show at G20; US fires sharp response,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/boycott-politics-never-work-south-africa-president-reacts-to-trumps-no-show-at-g20-us-fires-sharp-response/articleshow/125476117.cms,"‘WATCH YOUR TONE!’: Leavitt FUMES After Ramaphosa 'Laughs' At Trump’s Last-minute G20 ‘Scramble’





South African President Cyril Ramaphosa on Friday said the United States had shown signs of reconsidering its G20 boycott, calling it a “positive sign” and insisting that “boycott politics never work,” even as the White House dismissed his claim as “fake news” and accused him of “running his mouth. ”“In a way, we see this as a positive sign because, as I’ve often said, boycott politics never work. It’s always best to be inside the tent than being outside of the tent,” the President added.Ramaphosa said Pretoria had received a last-minute communication suggesting Washington might participate “in one shape or form or other” at the Johannesburg summit. “We have received notice from the United States, a notice which we are still in discussions with them over, about a change of mind, about participating in one shape or form or other in the summit,” he said. “This comes at the late hour before the summit begins. And so therefore, we do need to engage in those types of discussions to see how practical it is and what it finally really means.”The White House rejected any suggestion of a reversal. A senior official said only the acting ambassador, Marc D Dillard, would attend the ceremonial handover of the G20 presidency. “This is fake news. The chargé d'affaires in Pretoria will attend the handover ceremony as a formality, but the United States is not joining G20 discussions,” the official said.White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reinforced Washington’s position. “The United States is not participating in official talks at the G20 in South Africa,” she said. She added: “I saw the South African president running his mouth a little bit against the United States and the president of the United States earlier today, and that language is not appreciated by the president or his team.” She noted that Dillard would only “receive that send off at the end of the event” and would not “participate in official talks. ”Ramaphosa reiterated that the United States “needs to be here,” saying: “The United States, being the biggest economy in the world, needs to be here. So it's pleasing to hear that there is a change of approach.”The US boycott follows allegations from Washington that South Africa discriminates against white people and Trump’s claims of violence against white Afrikaner farmers, assertions widely rejected in South Africa. Pretoria said Washington also pressured it not to issue a joint G20 declaration, arguing consensus would be impossible without the United States.Ramaphosa pushed back. “We will have a declaration. The talks are going extremely well. I’m confident we are moving towards a declaration, and they are now just dotting the i’s and crossing the t’s,” he said. “We will not be bullied. We will not agree to be bullied.”The US embassy had separately informed Pretoria that South Africa’s G20 agenda “run counter to the US policy views and we cannot support consensus on any documents negotiated under your presidency.”The summit, the first hosted by an African nation, focuses on debt relief for low-income countries, a just energy transition and securing critical minerals. While leaders including Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin and Javier Milei skipped the event, they sent delegations.Political tensions between the two countries have intensified during Trump’s second term, with high US tariffs on South African goods, Pretoria’s ambassador being expelled and Washington also boycotting the COP30 climate talks in Brazil.Despite the diplomatic friction, US business interests in South Africa remain strong, with more than 600 American companies operating in the country. “The US Chamber of Commerce will use our B20 leadership to foster international collaboration,” chamber head Suzanne Clark said.G20 ambassador Xolisa Mabhongo summed up the stand-off, saying: “The only country that is not in the room is the United States and, of course, it is their choice not to be in the room.”","South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said the United States had shown signs of reconsidering its G20 boycott.

'Not a fundamental change'





PARIS: The US military operation against Venezuelan alleged drug traffickers coupled with threats by Donald Trump for a ground assault against President Nicolas Maduro have troubled European powers who retain strategically located territories in the Caribbean, observers say.The concern of France, the Netherlands and the UK is such that they have started limiting intelligence sharing with Washington about the Caribbean over worries it could be used for strikes that would be considered illegal in their countries, according to officials and sources who spoke to AFP.The UK retains small overseas territories in the Caribbean from the colonial era, while the large islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe as well as French Guiana on the South American mainland are now officially part of France.The Netherlands is the most geographically implicated, with three islands off the coast of Venezuela dubbed the ABC -- Aruba, Bonaire and Curacao -- all part of the kingdom.Venezuela has accused Washington of seeking regime change in Caracas with its military build-up, including an aircraft carrier group, warships and several stealth jets.Washington accuses Maduro of leading a ""terrorist"" drug cartel, a charge he denies.Since September, US forces have killed at least 83 people via air strikes on boats accused of ferrying drugs in international waters, according to an AFP tally of publicly released figures.The United States has released no details to back up its claims that the people targeted in both the Caribbean and eastern Pacific in the more than 20 strikes were traffickers.Trump has said he believes Maduro's days were numbered and on Monday refused to rule out boots on the ground while adding he was open to talks with the leftist leader.""The Dutch are concerned about their ABC islands... located about 50 kilometres (31 miles) off the coast of Venezuela,"" a French military official said, asking not to be named.They ""would find themselves on the front line"" in the event of war, a European military source added, also asking not to be named as they were not authorised to speak on the record.- 'Not currently giving intelligence' -With few options in the face of Trump's resolve, these three countries have decided to stop sharing certain intelligence with Washington, multiple sources said.""We are particularly vigilant regarding the politicisation of our services and human rights violations,"" Erik Akerboom, director of the Dutch civilian intelligence and counterintelligence service, told the newspaper De Volkskrant.""No European country, France included, will send operational intelligence to the Americans in the current situation if they could use it as a basis for a military strike on a ship,"" a senior French police official, Dimitri Zoulas, head of the OFAST anti-drug service, told Radio Caraibes (RCI).This position has not been publicly confirmed by French authorities. But a security source said: ""It is 100 percent clear that Europeans are not currently giving any intelligence to the United States that could lead to a strike.""In the UK, the Times reported that attorney general Richard Hermer, the government's top legal advisor, told ministers to cut off intelligence sharing over fears Trump could ""assassinate"" drug dealers in the Caribbean.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio earlier this month dismissed reports the UK had stopped sharing such intelligence as ""fake news"".Richard Dearlove, former head of the British MI6 foreign intelligence service, told AFP the situation was not unique and avoided Europeans being complicit in an action that was perhaps legal in an American jurisdiction but not in their countries.""It doesn't affect the overall intelligence exchange.

'If you kill this witness, the case will be dismissed'





Deepak Paradkar, a famous defence lawyer in Canada, was arrested and will now be extradited to the US as the US accused him of helping murder a witness who was set to testify against Deepak's client Ryan Wedding, a former Canadian Olympic athlete who turned into a drug lord. Deepak Paradkar is known for his high-profile clients, mostly drug lords, which also makes him popularly known as 'cocaine lawyer'. It was the profile name that he used on social media as he posted photos of clients getting cleared of drug charges.This is the advice that Paradkar gave to Wedding months before an FBI witness was gunned down at a restaurant in Colombia. He was shot five times in the head in January 2025. The former Olympic snowboarder ended up on the FBI's most wanted list for allegedly running a massive drug trafficking empire from Mexico after the US authorities intercepted one of his cocaine shipments in 2024. He was to be extradited from Mexico on criminal charges but Paradkar advised him that if the FBI witness is killed, he would not have to be extradited to the US.After this advice from Paradkar, Wedding paid a Canadian website that publishes crime news to post photos of the witness and his wife to locate them. After he was located in Colombia, he was shot dead. The US indictment claimed that Wedding gave Paradkar luxury watches and additional fees for his illegal services as he was not only providing Wedding legal consultations but was an integral member of Wedding's day-to-day operations, the US indictment alleged.According to the FBI, Paradkar also introduced Weddinng to trusted drug transportation networks and paid other defence attorneys in Canada and the US to look into anyone arrested with Wedding’s drugs. This way, authorities alleged, Paradkar could determine if anyone flipped on Wedding.","Deepak Paradkar, a famous defence lawyer in Canada, was arrested and will now be extradited to the US.

What was the motive behind the brutal murder?





The US authorities have sought the extradition of Nazeer Hameed, an Indian man, currently living in India, on charges of murdering a mother and son in 2017 in a New Jersey flat. 38-year-old Sasikala Narra and her 6-year-old son, Anish, were stabbed multiple times and the crime scene was described as difficult to forget as there were signs that both of them fought back the attack. Eight years have passed and Hameed went back to India but the investigation went on and now finally Nazeer Hameed has been charged with murder.Nazeer was a co-worker of Sasikala's husband and used to live within walking distance of the Narras. He was in the US on a work visa but he returned to India six months after the murders.Patrick Thornton, the Burlington County Prosecutor's Office chief of investigations, said investigators collected various evidence at the crime scene, including blood samples. A lab report issued after two years showed that a single drop of blood collected did not belong to the family. Then, investigators determined Nazeer Hameed was a person of interest.Nazeer was already in India and refused to give a DNA sample for the match which was crucial to solving the case. In 2024, the investigators obtained a court order that requested Nazeer's company in India to send them his company's laptop so that they could gather DNA evidence.""Ultimately, a DNA contributor was able to be obtained from the laptop, which matched the DNA from the unknown blood droplet from the crime scene,"" Lt. Brian Cunningham with the Burlington County Prosecutor's Office said.""Our message is clear. We did not forget,"" Burlington County Prosecutor LaChia Bradshaw said. ""We did not forgive, and we will not stop pursuing those who take innocent lives in this county. Justice must and will prevail.""Investigators said they don't have a motive for the murders.

Kash Patel’s Jet Scandal Erupts; $60M FBI Plane For Girlfriend’s Show? FBI Chief Slams Critics

Kash Patel’s use of jets and tactical teams fuels a broader controversy





The FBI has defended director Kash Patel’s controversial decision to deploy SWAT agents to protect his girlfriend, country singer Alexis Wilkins, insisting the extraordinary security measures were justified because she has received 'hundreds of credible death threats' linked to her relationship with Patel. The bureau’s statement comes amid growing criticism from current and former FBI officials, lawmakers and even conservative commentators who accuse Patel of misusing elite tactical teams and government aircraft for personal purposes.According to the bureau’s public statements, Wilkins’ protective detail was authorised after officials assessed repeated and credible threats directed at her online. An FBI spokesperson said that her safety concerns necessitated enhanced protection, although the bureau declined to provide specific details, citing operational sensitivity. Officials argue that Patel, as director, is a “required-use traveller” entitled to government aircraft and security assets, with the FBI emphasising that his travel and protective arrangements “follow all required regulations. ”Ben Williamson, Patel’s spokesman, further defended the deployments, saying the director would not compromise Wilkins’ safety and calling attacks on her “disgustingly baseless.”He added that Patel reimburses the government for personal travel at the commercial-ticket rate, which is standard practice for senior officials.The SWAT deployments are only part of a wider scandal surrounding Patel’s leadership, with critics pointing to his repeated use of a $60 million FBI Gulfstream jet for trips connected to Wilkins, including flights to her performances and cross-country visits. Former agents argue that diverting tactical units from emergency response work to protect a non-spouse is a misuse of government resources.while others accuse Patel of hypocrisy after he previously condemned similar travel habits by past FBI directors. Patel and his team maintain that all actions have adhered to policy and were driven solely by genuine security threats to Wilkins, but the controversy has intensified questions about his judgment, ethics and the blurring of personal and official boundaries at the top of the bureau.",FBI defends decision to deploy SWAT agents to protect Kash Patel's girlfriend Alexis Wilkins.

Kash Patel Reveals Epstein FBI Links? 'You Buffoon, I Won’t Lie To Americans’ | Dems Shocked





Raised with the Bhagwat Gita on a nightstand, FBI Director Kash Patel has often mused about his Hindu upbringing that he says taught him that truth (satya) is the highest calling, pledging to bring it to the Bureau. “Arjuna’s dilemma on the battlefield is the same one every prosecutor or warrior faces—do what is right even when it’s hard,” he said in a 2024 podcast. Soon after, he presented President Trump with a small brass Ganesha idol at a Mar-a-Lago event, explaining it as the “remover of obstacles” for the coming administration.But the only obstacles he may be removing, according to Virginia Congressman Suhas Subramanyam – who like Patel also took oath of office on the Bhagwat Gita – is scrubbing the Epstein files of material that could implicate the President. In a formal letter last week to Patel flagging ""possible tampering"" in the Epstein documents, Subramanyam cited Epstein’s brother Mark Epstein among others, to allege that Republican names from the files were being redacted, and called for full transparency and access to the FBI Central Records Complex located just outside his Congressional district.It is the latest salvo against the FBI’s first Indian-origin Director who quite overtly embraces his Hindu heritage with a thin red kalava (moli) thread on his right wrist and frequent invocation of “Jai Shree Krishna” with Indian families and friends.Just ten months into his job, Patel has been buffeted by so many controversies that it is hard to see him complete a Congressionally-mandated ten-year term given to the FBI Director (to insulate the office from political pressure).Once hailed as a ""warrior"" against the ""deep state,"" the 45-year old Trump loyalist faces lawsuits, whistleblower accusations, and even rebukes from MAGA fringes. His aggressive reforms—aimed at rooting out perceived biases from Trump-era probes—have substantiated claims of retribution and resource abuse, while his Gujarati immigrant roots have sparked xenophobic ire within the coalition that elevated him, with some MAGA activists turning against him. “My blood is Gujarati, my heart is American, and my duty is to the Constitution—deal with it,” he recently lashed back against a racist attack on his Diwali greeting earlier that day, even as progressives are on the prowl tracking any missteps.Some of the fireworks triggered by his critics involve his girlfriend Alexis Wilkins, a country music artist, who the NYT reported over the weekend, received protection from an FBI SWAT team at a National Rifle Association (NRA) convention last spring in Atlanta where she sang The Star-Spangled Banner. Other allegations include Patel using the FBI's $60 million jet for trips to attend his girlfriend’s' concerts, among other gigs.Patel has dismissed charges from folks he calls “internet anarchists,” while defending the deployment of SWAT teams because of the death threats faced by his girlfriend – who in turn has sued against allegations that she is a Mossad honeypit planted to entrap Patel. Some of the leaks appear to come from within an establishment, where Patel’s purge of agents and prosecutors who he believes unfairly targeted Trump when he was out of office has caused deep rifts.But all these spats are likely to pale before the upcoming release of the complete Epstein documents by December 19, 30 days after Trump signed the Epstein Files Transparency Act into law on November 19. Many US lawmakers and transparency activists see Patel as the last man standing between Trump and the truth closing in on the elites in arguably the largest predatory sex scandal in US history.",Congressman Suhas Subramanyam says the FBI is scrubbing the Epstein files of material that could implicate the President. It is the latest salvo against the FBI’s first Indian-origin Director who quite overtly embraces his Hindu heritage.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125522395,imgsize-23638,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

'No Talent In U.S.': Trump BURNS MAGA Base For India Reset? What It Means For Indian Workers





US diplomat Mahvash Siddiqui, an Indian-origin US Foreign Service Officer, called out the industrialized fraud in the H-1B visa program as she recounted her experience at the Chennai consulate in India 20 years ago. Siddiqui appeared on a podcast and spoke on her personal capacity and not as a diplomat as she busted the myth that America has a shortage of STEM talents that have to be filled from India. The diplomat revealed a shocking figure and claimed that 80-90% of the H-1B visas from India are fake -- either they have fake degrees or some other forged documents or they are not highly skilled as to be deserving an H-1B visa.The H-1B visa program allows US companies to hire skilled workers from foreign countries. The Donald Trump administration has come under heat over its vacillating stand on the issue as H-1B now has a fee of $100,000 so that only candidates who are absolutely necessary and are highly skilled can be hired, but the administration does not want to take a strong stand against the visa program. In a recent interview, President Trump has made it clear that America needs H-1B as there are certain talents that the US needs to hire from other countries.Siddiqui said she was posted to the Chennai consulate from 2005 to 2007 when she adjudicated at least 51,000 H-1B visas. The Chennai consulate processed applications from four regions: Hyderabad, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, she said, adding that Hyderabad was the most concerning as Hyderabad's Ameerpet had shops not only consulting candidates on visa but providing them with forged documents -- be it an educational certificate or a marriage certificate. Siddiqui said she and the team she was working with quickly learned the fraud pattern and flagged it to the administration but there was a lot of political pressure. And their anti-fraud drive was called a 'rogue operation'.""As an Indian-American, I hate to say this but fraud and bribery are normalized in India,"" Siddiqui said, adding that she doesn't want to generalize but there were cases where the candidates did not even appear for their job interview themselves if the interviewer was an American. Proxy candidates giving interview, Indian manager giving jobs to Indians in exchange of a monthly cut from the salaries are some of the cases she said were rampant in H-1B.",Indian-American US diplomat claims there is an industry in India which is facilitating H-1B fraud.

'Furious' Trump 'SNAPS' At Zelensky As Ukraine 'Refuses Surrender' To Putin | Geneva Talks Teeter





US President Donald Trump on Sunday accused Ukraine’s leadership of showing “zero gratitude” for Washington’s support in its war against Russia, while also criticising European allies for continuing to buy Russian oil.""UKRAINE “LEADERSHIP” HAS EXPRESSED ZERO GRATITUDE FOR OUR EFFORTS, AND EUROPE CONTINUES TO BUY OIL FROM RUSSIA. THE USA CONTINUES TO SELL MASSIVE $AMOUNTS OF WEAPONS TO NATO, FOR DISTRIBUTION TO UKRAINE,"" Trump said through a post on Truth Social.This comes amid high-level talks in Geneva between US and Ukrainian officials on a proposed plan to halt the conflict.Trump also claimed that the Russia-Ukraine war “would have never happened” under what he described as “strong and proper US and Ukrainian leadership,” accusing former President Joe Biden of enabling the conflict through what he called weak governance.The US president asserted that the war began “during the Sleepy Joe Biden Administration” and argued that Russian President Vladimir Putin would not have launched the invasion had he remained in office.""I INHERITED A WAR THAT SHOULD HAVE NEVER HAPPENED, A WAR THAT IS A LOSER FOR EVERYONE, ESPECIALLY THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE SO NEEDLESSLY DIED,"" Trump said.Zelenskyy has repeatedly expressed Ukraine’s gratitude, saying “thank you” on multiple occasions, even as Republicans in the White House have criticized him for allegedly not showing enough appreciation for US support.Meanwhile, the US and Russia have reportedly drawn up a 28-point roadmap to end the war, a framework that would require Ukraine to surrender both weapons and territory. Trump, facing fierce criticism from Ukrainians, insisted on Saturday that his proposed “peace plan” was “not my final offer.”When asked what would happen if Zelenskyy rejected the proposal, the US President responded, “then he can continue to fight his little heart out.”The plan drafted by Washington includes several of Moscow’s long-standing demands, from territorial concessions to cuts in Ukraine’s military and a freeze on Nato ambitions, while offering only limited security assurances.Putin said that although Russia had received the document, it “has not been discussed with us in any substantive way,” adding that Ukraine and its European partners “still dream of inflicting a strategic defeat on Russia on the battlefield.”",US President Donald Trump accused Ukraine's leadership of showing “zero gratitude” for Washington’s support in its war against Russia.

The bigger travel picture: Roads and rails will be packed too

Cars: An estimated 73 million people will take to the roads, nearly 90% of all Thanksgiving travellers — and 1.3 million more than last year. Car-rental agencies are already reporting all-time-high booking activity for the holiday week, and if weather-related flight cancellations occur, this number could climb even further. The resulting congestion could also spill into airport access roads, creating traffic jams around terminals and adding yet another layer of pressure for air travellers trying to reach their flights on time.

with bus and rail likely to see last-minute booking spikes. City buses and feeder services, which link neighbourhoods to major junctions like metro stations and rail terminals, will play a crucial role in last-mile connectivity, though many of these services may be packed throughout the holiday week.



Cruises remain popular, with 20.7 million Americans sailing in 2025 and 21.7 million projected in 2026. Caribbean routes are especially attractive around Thanksgiving due to warm weather and all-inclusive family appeal.





According to AAA, travel across these modes will rise 8.5%, reaching nearly 2.5 million travellers.

A holiday rush that’s manageable with preparation





Thanksgiving week is always a national homecoming, but this year the scale is on a different level. Whether you’re flying, driving, or taking the train, the country is about to experience one of the most congested travel periods in modern history. AAA expects 81.8 million people to travel 50 miles or more between 25 November and 1 December, and the strain will be felt everywhere, from highways to departure gates. Air travel, in particular, will feel intense. The TSA is preparing to screen almost 18 million passengers in just seven days, while airlines and federal agencies brace for some of the busiest airport moments Americans have ever seen. If you’re heading to the skies, here’s the full picture, and what you can do to stay ahead of the rush.The upcoming week will push air travel to extraordinary levels. TSA expects more than 17.8 million screenings from 25 November to 2 December, with Sunday 30 November projected to exceed three million passengers, securing its place as one of the busiest days on record.The trend mirrors the year overall: eight of the ten highest-volume TSA days have occurred in 2025, with a daily average of 2.48 million travellers, up from 2.47 million in 2024, or roughly 14,000 more people every day.The Federal Aviation Administration is seeing similar intensity from its side.Airlines are adding capacity to cope. According to Airlines for America (A4A):With so many moving parts full aircraft, tight schedules, and intense gate activity, the airport environment will feel busy from the moment travellers arrive.TSA is rolling out extra staffing and expanded lanes, but the agency stresses that passenger preparation still plays a major role. Their key guidance includes:Together, these steps will help smooth out what is expected to be an exceptionally busy week.Beyond official guidelines, a few practical steps can significantly reduce stress during holiday travel:These steps aren’t glamorous, but they are realistic and effective, especially during a holiday period where millions of passengers will be competing for the same airport resources.While airports will feel the most pressure, the broader travel landscape is equally intense, if not more. AAA’s forecast of 81.8 million travellers highlights how widespread the movement will be.Here’s how the modes break down:Even though fewer people use these modes compared with flying or driving, the surge still adds to the picture of just how much movement is happening across the country.Thanksgiving 2025 will bring some of the highest travel volumes America has experienced, from almost 18 million passengers in TSA lines to 360,000+ flights navigating the skies. But with smart planning, early arrivals, and the right tools at hand, travellers can navigate the crowds and make it home in time for the holiday table. Families travelling with children should map out their journey in advance and build in buffer time for meals, naps, and airport navigation. It also helps to keep a flexible Plan B, whether that’s a rental car, a long-distance drive, or even a rail option, in case delays stack up. Preparing for busy terminals and packed roads makes the whole experience far more manageable.","More than 360,000 flights are scheduled nationwide for Thanksgiving week.

Who is Lindsey Halligan?

Lindsey Halligan’s path to federal power

Halligan’s appointment raises political questions



The ‘puppet’ controversy explodes into public view





Lindsey Halligan’s sudden rise from a Miss Colorado USA finalist to one of the most scrutinised federal prosecutors in America has set off a political and legal firestorm. Installed by President Donald Trump as interim US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, she now finds herself at the centre of the case against former FBI director James Comey and at the heart of an extraordinary public clash with the judge overseeing it.Halligan, 36, was appointed after her predecessor reportedly refused to bring charges against Comey. Within days she began presenting evidence to a grand jury, but the prosecution has faced serious procedural failures, contradictions and accusations of political motive. The controversy deepened when Halligan publicly accused the judge of calling her a “puppet”, prompting a rare and highly criticised confrontation between a federal prosecutor and the bench.Halligan grew up in Colorado, where she played school sports and twice competed in the Miss Colorado USA pageant, reaching the semi-finals in 2009 and placing fourth in 2010. After studying politics and journalism at Regis University and earning her law degree from the University of Miami, she began her career in insurance defence litigation, eventually becoming a partner at a Florida firm.Her national profile changed after she met Trump at a West Palm Beach golf course in 2021.She later joined his legal team, appeared frequently on conservative media defending him, witnessed the FBI’s Mar a Lago search and even attended high profile events such as the US Open alongside him. By early 2025, Trump had brought her into the White House and then appointed her interim US attorney despite her having handled only three federal cases in her career.Critics argue that Halligan’s appointment was directly tied to Trump’s push to prosecute Comey before the statute of limitations expired. Her predecessor, Erik Siebert, reportedly declined to pursue charges; Trump removed him and installed Halligan, who launched the prosecution within days. Comey’s defence now claims this sequence demonstrates vindictive prosecution, alleging Halligan acted as a stalking horse for Trump’s political animus.The judge, Michael S. Nachmanoff, explored this issue in court, asking Comey’s lawyer whether the defence believed Halligan was functioning as a stalking horse or a puppet, for want of a better word, doing the president’s bidding. Although framed as a legal query, Halligan publicly accused him of a personal attack, escalating tensions dramatically.Following the hearing, Halligan issued a statement insisting:“Personal attacks like Judge Nachmanoff referring to me as a ‘puppet’ do not change the facts or the law.”DOJ spokesman Chad Gilmartin amplified her comments on social media, accusing the judge of crossing ethical lines. Legal experts reacted with astonishment, warning that publicly attacking a judge risks undermining the prosecution and could antagonise the court at a crucial moment.Lawyers and former prosecutors emphasised that Nachmanoff did not call her a puppet, but merely posed the term hypothetically in the context of the legal standard for vindictive prosecution. Still, Halligan’s response turned the exchange into a national controversy, deepening scrutiny of her experience and judgement.Halligan’s rapid ascent, her close ties to Trump, the grand jury confusion and her public dispute with the judge have all intensified scepticism surrounding the Comey case. For the judge, the central question is whether the prosecution is legally sound and whether it was driven by political pressure rather than evidence.","Lindsey Halligan is the interim US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia.

"COLA increases Social Security payments for 2026: Boosts confirmed for retirees, spouses, survivors and disability recipients",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/cola-increases-social-security-payments-for-2026-boosts-confirmed-for-retirees-spouses-survivors-and-disability-recipients/articleshow/125520986.cms,"What the 2.8% COLA means for beneficiaries

When will beneficiaries receive their updated amounts





Social Security beneficiaries are set to receive a higher monthly income in 2026 after the Social Security Administration confirmed a 2.8% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA). The increase will raise payments for more than 75 million Americans, including retirees, spouses, survivors, disabled workers and SSI recipients. The adjustment takes effect automatically, with the first larger payments arriving in January 2026 and SSI increases beginning on 31 December 2025.The new COLA will lift the average retirement benefit from $2,008 to $2,064 per month, adding $56 to the typical retiree’s income. Spousal benefits will increase from $954 to $981, survivor benefits from $1,575 to $1,619 and average disabled-worker payments from $1,583 to $1,627. Around 7.5 million SSI recipients will also see their payments rise, with adjustments applied to both Social Security and SSI for those who receive benefits from both programmes.Although the increase is welcome, it remains below the average COLA over the past decade and may not fully match rising living costs, particularly healthcare expenses, which weigh more heavily on older Americans.Beneficiaries who continue working while claiming Social Security before their full retirement age will see higher earnings thresholds in 2026.The annual earnings limit will increase to $24,480, up from $23,500, while the upper limit for those reaching full retirement age during the year will rise to $65,160.Exceeding these thresholds can result in temporary benefit withholdings, though withheld amounts are later credited back once full retirement age is reached. No earnings test applies after reaching full retirement age.The highest possible Social Security benefit for someone retiring at full retirement age will rise from $4,018 to $4,152 in 2026. This reflects an increase in the maximum taxable earnings cap, which climbs from $176,100 in 2025 to $184,500 in 2026. Higher wage indexing ensures that maximum benefits grow in line with national earnings trends.For many retirees enrolled in Medicare Part B, rising healthcare costs may offset part of their COLA increase. The standard Medicare Part B premium will climb 9.7% next year to $202.90, driven by higher outpatient care costs and prescription-drug spending. While this premium is deducted directly from most Social Security payments, the COLA ensures beneficiaries do not receive a net reduction in their monthly deposit — though many will see little or no real financial gain.The Social Security Administration will send personalised COLA notices in late November via online accounts, with paper letters arriving in December. These one-page summaries will outline each beneficiary’s new monthly amount, deductions and payment schedule. Even if a notice is delayed or misplaced, the higher payment will arrive automatically in January 2026. Medicare enrollees will also see updated premium information in their online Message Centre.","The increase will raise payments for more than 75 million Americans.

Ex-CIA Reveals Savage Reply To Imran Khan’s PTI After Apology Demand Over His India-Pak War Analysis





Former CIA officer John Kiriakou -- who once headed the agency’s counterterrorism operations in Pakistan -- said Pakistani officials sent him a letter demanding an apology for his remark that India would defeat Pakistan in a conventional war.Reacting to the letter on the podcast of internet personality Julian Dorey, Kiriakou used blunt language as he mocked former Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan and his party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) for the demand of apology.Kiriakou has recently made a series of striking claims in an interview with ANI news agency, including that the White House had expected “India to strike back after the 2001 and 2008 attacks.” He also recounted how Osama bin Laden escaped from the Tora Bora mountains into Pakistan.Kiriakou was speaking about the 2001 Parliament attack in New Delhi, carried out by Pakistan-backed Jaish-e-Mohammad, and the 2008 Mumbai attacks launched by Lashkar-e-Taiba, another Pakistan-nurtured terror outfit. The United States itself had suffered a devastating blow just months before India’s Parliament attack -- the 9/11 strikes by Osama bin Laden–led Al-Qaeda on the World Trade Center in New York.Recalling the events at Tora Bora, Kiriakou said American forces had cornered Bin Laden in the mountains as heavy bombing continued. “We knew we had Bin Laden cornered. We told him to come down the mountain,” he said. Bin Laden asked for time until dawn, claiming he needed to evacuate women and children.“But then,” Kiriakou said, “Osama bin Laden dressed as a woman and escaped under the cover of darkness in the back of a pickup truck into Pakistan.”Kiriakou also claimed the US had effectively “purchased” Pakistan’s then-president Pervez Musharraf . He said this after remarking that “the United States loves working with dictators.” According to him, Washington paid “tens of millions of dollars in cash to the Pakistani intelligence service.”Speaking about the attacks on India, he said, “The Indian government would have been perfectly within its rights to respond by striking Pakistan.” He added: “At the White House, we expected the Indians to strike back and they did not.”He then went further, making an explosive assertion about Pakistan’s nuclear weapons. “In 2002, I was told, unofficially, that the Pentagon controlled Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal,” Kiriakou said.And in a blunt assessment of the military balance between the two neighbours, he stated: “Pakistan cannot win a conventional war against India.”","Former CIA officer John Kiriakou said Pakistani officials sent him a letter demanding an apology for his remark that India would defeat Pakistan in a conventional war.

At least 15 workers were killed and seven others injured on Friday after a boiler exploded at a glue-making factory in Faisalabad, eastern Pakistan, authorities said. Police reported that the factory manager had been arrested, while the owner fled the scene shortly after the blast.The explosion occurred at the industrial unit in Punjab province, severely damaging the building and triggering a fire that spread panic across the neighbourhood. Local administrator Raja Jahangir said the cause of the blast was being investigated and confirmed that nearby homes had also been affected.Police official Mohammad Aslam said an investigation was underway to determine what led to the boiler failure. Pakistan Punjab chief minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif expressed condolences to the families of the victims and directed officials to provide the best possible medical care to the injured.Industrial accidents remain common in Pakistan, where poor safety standards often contribute to fatal incidents. In 2024, a similar boiler explosion at a Faisalabad textile mill left a dozen workers injured. Just last week, four workers were killed in a blast at a firecrackers factory in Karachi.","The explosion occurred at the industrial unit in Punjab province, severely damaging the building and triggering a fire that spread panic across the neighbourhood.

The region frequently experiences moderate to strong earthquakes, often felt across borders in Afghanistan and northern India.Multiple provinces lie close to major fault lines. Balochistan sits near the active boundary between the Arabian and Eurasian plates. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan fall along the southern edge of the Eurasian plate, while Punjab and Sindh are positioned on the northwestern edge of the Indian plate, making large parts of the country vulnerable to frequent seismic activity.","The quake occurred at a depth of 135 kilometres, with tremors recorded at 03:09:12 IST.

Munir’s expanding power base



(With inputs from agencies)





Pakistan’s judiciary is in a moment of crisis as senior judges resign amid a contentious constitutional amendment reshapes the balance of power in favour of the military. Behind the crisis is the contentious 27th Constitutional Amendment, a sweeping package pushed through parliament within days. Lawyers, judges and opposition parties argue that it has weakened the courts and elevated the military’s top commander to a position with no modern parallel.Since then, Pakistan’s judiciary has been hit by a series of high-profile resignations. On Saturday, Lahore High Court judge Shams Mehmood Mirza stepped down, and his family said his decision was directly linked to the 27th Amendment. His departure followed those of Supreme Court justices Mansoor Ali Shah and Athar Minallah, who issued sharply worded letters condemning the amendment as a direct attack on judicial independence.The creation of a new Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) lies at the heart of judicial restructuring. The FCC now holds exclusive jurisdiction over constitutional matters, stripping the Supreme Court of its original powers. Pending petitions have already been shifted to the new court. President Zardari swore in Justice Aminuddin Khan as its first chief justice; six other judges were appointed, including serving Supreme Court and high court judges, though one judge reportedly refused to join.The FCC’s establishment has sparked intense concern. Critics say the president’s new power to transfer judges risks becoming a tool to sideline dissenting voices. Opposition groups argue this will fundamentally weaken judicial independence and concentrate constitutional authority in the executive and military leadership.Government ministers, however, hailed the package as “historic” and a step toward greater efficiency and national unity. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said the amendment proved that “solidarity” prevailed during a time of national strain.With judges resigning, courts being reconfigured, and the military gaining unprecedented constitutional control, Pakistan faces a moment of reckoning.The amendment passed with overwhelming numbers in both houses has dramatically restructured Pakistan’s defence architecture, elevating army chief Asim Munir to Chief of Defence Forces with command over all three military branches. His five-year tenure now resets from the date of notification, enabling him to remain in office until 2030.The Senate has since rushed through four related bills, including amendments to the Army, Air Force and Navy Acts, along with changes to Supreme Court practice rules. These laws remove the earlier equality among service chiefs and replace references to the Joint Chiefs of Staff system with a new “National Strategic Command”, further centralising military authority under Munir.Dawn reported that appointments, extensions, and tenures under these reforms “shall not be called into question before any court on any ground whatsoever”.Experts quoted in multiple reports warn that the shift risks internal military tensions and further erodes civilian oversight. Lawyer Osama Malik described the reforms as something “usually granted in absolute monarchies”, arguing they grant lifetime protections not only to Munir but also to President Zardari.Opposition lawmakers responded with uproar, shredding copies of the bill and walking out. PTI leaders labelled the move “deeply undemocratic” and “the final nail in the coffin of an independent judiciary”. Critics say these changes could reshape the political landscape, particularly for nearly 200 cases involving former prime minister Imran Khan.","Pakistan's judiciary is in a moment of crisis as senior judges resign amid a contentious constitutional amendment.

Military reforms: Asim Munir at the helm



Judicial restructuring: Federal constitutional court



Political reactions



What next







Pakistan’s National Assembly on Wednesday passed the 27th constitutional amendment bill, granting sweeping powers to the military in general and country’s army chief Asim Munir in specific, and restructuring the judiciary.The vote, held amid a ruckus in the lower house, saw 234 lawmakers in favour and only four against, speaker Ayaz Sadiq announced. The session was attended by top political leaders, including Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, PML-N President Nawaz Sharif, and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari.The amendment comes at a time of heightened political tension in Pakistan, with the ruling coalition seeking to consolidate control over key defence and judicial institutions. The legislation follows earlier Senate approval, where it received 64 votes in favour and no opposition, as the opposition benches boycotted proceedings.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif hailed the passage as a demonstration of national unity, saying the house exhibited solidarity. He also condemned a recent terrorist incident in Wana, drawing parallels to the Army Public School massacre, and praised law enforcement for securing the safety of students and cadets.The amendment elevates Pakistan army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir to the newly created role of Chief of Defence Forces, giving him constitutional authority over all three branches: army, navy, and air force. Honorary five-star ranks such as field marshal, marshal of the air force, and admiral of the fleet remain lifetime titles. According to the country's law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, the reform “aims to bring constitutional oversight to defence appointments while preserving military honour and tradition.The bill also establishes a federal constitutional court (FCC) to handle constitutional and provincial matters, leaving the Supreme Court to focus on civil and criminal cases. The FCC will have equal representation from all provinces and the power to take suo motu notices on constitutional petitions. The Judicial Commission will oversee judge transfers; refusal of a transfer will be treated as retirement.The ruling coalition, including PML-N, PPP, MQM-P, and allies, backed the amendment. Opposition lawmakers condemned it as unconstitutional. PTI chairman Gohar Ali Khan called it the “Baku Amendments” and accused the government of undermining democracy. Mehmood Khan Achakzai of PkMAP protested by tearing a copy of the bill in the house.The amendment now returns to the Senate for final approval before becoming law. Analysts say the 27th amendment significantly strengthens Munir’s role in Pakistan’s military hierarchy while altering judicial oversight, marking a shift in Pakistan’s institutional framework.(With input from agencies, Dawn)","The amendment elevates Pakistan army chief Asim Munir to the newly created role of Chief of Defence Forces.

Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Powers Set To Grow As Shehbaz Govt Mulls 27th Constitution Amendment

Why it matters

The big picture

The Field Marshal’s expanding power evokes a hybrid of Pakistan’s two most dominant military rulers:

Ayub Khan, who introduced centralized presidential control and laid the foundations for military-led governance.

Zia-ul-Haq, who used the Army and Islamization to seize power, marginalize the judiciary, and suppress civilian opposition.

Munir is consolidating power not through martial law, but via constitutional amendments passed by a pliant parliament.

If Zia’s coup was loud and brutal against a strong popular leadership, Munir’s is silent, yet possibly more far reaching, being done through a political front office that’s pliant and dependent on the Army for authority. With Imran Khan in prison, any opposition will come from the streets and the troubled insurgencies to the west of Islamabad.

Pranab Dhal Samanta in the Economic Times

Zoom in

The transformation follows the India-Pakistan conflict in May 2025, a four-day exchange of air and missile strikes after the Pahalgam terror attack.

India’s Operation Sindoor targeted Pakistani airbases, radars, and command centers.

Pakistan requested a ceasefire after intense damage - a request reportedly initiated by Pakistan’s DGMO.

Donald Trump, who claimed to have brokered the truce(India has repeatedly denied the US President's claims), was effusively thanked by Munir and PM Shehbaz Sharif. Trump now calls Munir his “favorite field marshal.”

The Financial Times described their dynamic as a “bromance,” with Trump showcased on billboards across Pakistan alongside Munir and Sharif.

This international validation was followed by Munir’s promotion to Field Marshal, the second such promotion in Pakistan’s history - and the first codified under the Constitution.

Between the lines

This isn’t just about military command - it’s about rewriting the DNA of the Pakistani state.

The amendment creates a new Federal Constitutional Court, potentially diluting the powers of the Supreme Court and creating ambiguity about the hierarchy of judicial authority.

President Zardari is also granted lifelong immunity in the amendment, mirroring the legal shield given to Munir.

This dual protection signals a strategic alliance between the military and top civilian figures to institutionalize mutual insulation from accountability.

“Too much has been left to ad hoc and arbitrary decisions,” Mazari warned.

The domestic question: Can repression deliver reform?

The three-front storm: Taliban, TTP, and India

“If you nurture snakes in your backyard, they will bite you,” said Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, the Pakistani military’s official spokesman, referencing the Taliban. What a comeuppance : The remark could just as well apply to all Pakistan-grown terror groups and the TTP, whose resurgence is a grim case of blowback.

The bottom line





In Pakistan, where generals have often ruled with impunity and influence, Field Marshal Asim Munir is scripting a new playbook-quiet, precise, and constitutionally sealed. His rise is not just another chapter in the country’s well-worn saga of military dominance. It is, as one senior opposition leader put it, “a rewrite of the entire power manual.”Pakistan’s controversial 27th Constitutional Amendment proposes to recast the country’s military command structure by abolishing the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC) and creating the role of Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) - a position that will be held by the Army Chief, currently Field Marshal Asim Munir •The amendment vests unprecedented legal and constitutional power in the CDF, giving Munir operational and institutional control over the army, navy, and air force, as well as the country’s nuclear command.•It also grants five-star officers life-long rank, privileges, and immunity, a move seen as creating a parallel unelected authority beyond the reach of civilian or judicial oversight.“This amendment appears tailored to benefit a specific individual rather than to strengthen the defence structure,” Lt Gen Asif Yasin Malik, former defence secretary, told Dawn.The CJCSC post - created after the 1971 war to ensure coordination among services - will be dissolved on November 27, 2025, when the current chairman, Gen Sahir Shamshad Mirza, retires.The 27th Amendment represents the largest shift in Pakistan’s civil-military balance since the Zia era, codifying the military’s supremacy in a way that future civilian governments may struggle to reverse.•The military will no longer merely influence governance from behind the scenes - it will be constitutionally entrenched at the center of executive authority.•Strategic nuclear assets, previously overseen by the National Command Authority, will now fall under the commander of national strategic command, appointed by the PM on the army chief’s advice, and selected from within the army.“All nuclear weapons and delivery systems will be under army control, including second-strike missiles traditionally under the Navy,” warned Dr Shireen Mazari, former human rights minister, a Dawn report said.•The change grants the army a monopoly over promotions, transfers, and postings across the services, threatening morale and inter-service harmony.“If promotions in the Air Force and Navy are determined by an army-origin CDF, it could lead to festering resentments,” Mazari cautioned.At home, Munir is both omnipresent and embattled. According to a Financial Times report, his supporters compare him to Mohammed bin Salman or South Korea’s General Park - ruthless modernisers willing to bulldoze institutions in the name of reform. His critics, however, see echoes of Zia-ul-Haq’s theocratic militarism cloaked in constitutional legitimacy.The judiciary is already split, thanks to a proposed constitutional court that would dilute the Supreme Court’s power. Journalists are censored, civil rights groups are muzzled, and political opponents - most notably former Prime Minister Imran Khan - are jailed or silenced.And yet, Munir has cast himself as the architect of reform. In his speech at the Pakistan Military Academy, he spoke of “treasures hidden beneath our land” and claimed that Pakistan had begun to “regain its rightful place in the comity of nations.”But the economy tells another story. As per the FT report, Pakistan’s investment rate is the lowest in South Asia, its poverty rate has risen to 25%, and its youth unemployment is dangerously high. The country remains dependent on IMF bailouts and Gulf financing that has yet to materialise in promised volumes.While Munir consolidates power at home, Pakistan finds itself encircled by a resurgent triangle of threats - each historically rooted, each dangerously revived. In the west, the Afghan Taliban’s return to power in 2021 has proved more liability than leverage. Once covertly supported by Pakistan’s security establishment, the Taliban now resist Islamabad’s demands and turn a blind eye to cross-border attacks on Pakistani soil.More ominously, the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), an offshoot long declared outlawed, has regrouped in Afghanistan and resumed attacks in Pakistan’s tribal belt and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. This year alone, militant violence has killed over 1,400 people - the highest toll in a decade.“The military simply lacks political support on the ground there,” Iftikhar Firdous, founder of The Khorasan Diary, told FT. “The crackdown has alienated entire communities.”Simultaneously, Pakistan’s eastern border with India remains fragile after the four-day air conflict in May.Add to that domestic insurgencies in Balochistan and the Pashtun belt, and Pakistan now faces not one, but three overlapping security fronts. Instead of acting as a force-multiplier, the military’s expanding political and economic footprint is beginning to stretch its operational capacity thin.The 27th Amendment enshrines military supremacy in Pakistan's Constitution under the guise of reform and modernization.•It moves the country further away from parliamentary democracy, and deeper into military-led constitutional authoritarianism.•As Field Marshal Asim Munir prepares to become the first Chief of Defence Forces, Pakistan’s most consequential question remains: Can a military man fix a failing nation - or will history repeat itself?(With inputs from agencies)","Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Powers Set To Grow As Shehbaz Govt Mulls 27th Constitution Amendment.

ISLAMABAD: A suicide bomber killed 12 people outside a court in Islamabad on Tuesday in a sharp escalation of militant violence that the defence minister said had pushed the country into a ""state of war"".Pakistani govt ministers accused neighbouring Afghanistan of complicity in the bloodshed - an accusation Kabul denied - and vowed retaliation if Afghan authorities failed to rein in the militants Islamabad says were responsible. ""We are in a state of war,"" said defence minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif after the attack, the first strike on civilians in Islamabad in a decade. ""Bringing this war to Islamabad is a message from Kabul, to which Pakistan has the full power to respond. ""The bombing outside an Islamabad court also wounded 27 people interior minister Mohsin Naqvi said. The court bomber blew himself up near the entrance at around lunchtime. Images on local media showed people covered in blood lying next to a police van. A vehicle was seen on fire and another car was badly damaged. Police cordoned off the site. Naqvi said the bomber had tried to enter the court building on foot but, unable to find a way in, detonated the device outside, close to a police vehicle.Several of the wounded were in critical condition, a hospital source said.No group claimed responsibility for Tuesday's attack. The main Pakistani militant group, Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), denied involvement in the attacks. But a group affiliated with the Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, according to The Khorasan Diary, a digital platform in Islamabad that monitors militant activity in the region.TTP militants have in recent years focused attacks on security forces. Civilians had not been hit in Islamabad for a decade, according to Armed Conflict Location and Event Data, a group that tracks attacks.Islamabad says that the Pakistani Taliban and other militants are based in Afghanistan, with the support of India. ""We are totally clear that Afghanistan has to stop them. In case of a failure, we have no option but to take care of those terrorists who are attacking our country,"" Naqvi said, speaking at the scene of the court bombing. The Taliban administration spokesperson in Kabul did not respond to a request for comment on Pakistan's accusations.The court attack happened hours after militants stormed a school near the Afghan border on Monday. The attack on the school in Wana, in the north west, began Monday, when a suicide vehicle rammed the main entrance, killing three people, Naqvi said. Militants then entered the school, which is run by the military but educates civilians.By Tuesday evening, three militants were still inside the compound, security officials said, with rescue operations under way for the students trapped in another part of the school. Naqvi said that the school assailants were in contact with their handlers in Afghanistan during the attack.Reuters","A suicide bomber killed 12 people outside a court in Islamabad on Tuesday in a sharp escalation of militant violence.

Surge in militant violence and worsening ties with Afghanistan







Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif said the country was “in a state of war” after a suicide bomber struck outside the Islamabad district courts on Tuesday, killing at least 12 people and injuring 27.The blast one of the deadliest to hit the capital in recent years has intensified tensions with Afghanistan, with Asif accusing the Taliban government in Kabul of allowing militants to operate freely.In a post on X, Asif said: “Anyone who thinks that the Pakistan army is fighting this war in the Afghan-Pakistan border region and the remote areas of Balochistan should take today’s suicide attack at the Islamabad district courts as a wake-up call: This is a war for all of Pakistan.”He wrote that Pakistan’s military was making “daily sacrifices while providing citizens with a sense of protection and security”, but warned that hoping for negotiations with Kabul would be a “mistake”. Asif insisted that Afghanistan “has the ability to prevent terrorist attacks inside Pakistan” and that bringing the conflict to the capital was “a message from Kabul”.He added that Pakistan “has the strength to respond fully”, saying the attack had erased any remaining doubts about the threat posed by militants operating from Afghan soil.The explosion took place around midday in Islamabad’s G-11 district, just outside the judicial complex where hundreds of lawyers and visitors were present. Police said the attacker tried to enter the court premises but failed, eventually detonating explosives next to a police vehicle, igniting cars and sending a fireball through the street.Interior minister Mohsin Naqvi confirmed that 12 people were killed and 27 wounded. He said authorities had recovered a severed head believed to be that of the attacker, and CCTV footage captured him moments before the blast. Witnesses described scenes of chaos, with people screaming for help as ambulances rushed to the site.The blast comes amid a sharp rise in militant violence across Pakistan. Security officials say the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) has carried out hundreds of attacks this year, mostly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa near the Afghan border, but strikes in major cities have been rare. Islamabad was last hit by a suicide attack three years ago.On Monday night, militants also attempted to storm an army-run college in Wana, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Security forces killed two attackers quickly, while others were cornered inside an administrative building. Students and staff were evacuated, and the military said the assault resembled the TTP’s 2014 massacre in Peshawar that killed 154 people.Pakistan says the Afghan Taliban have allowed TTP fighters to take refuge across the border.

However, Pakistan's core concern, i.e. terrorism emanating from Afghanistan, needs to be addressed first and foremost,"" the FO said in a statement.It also said that Pakistan's Armed Forces and its people were well determined to eliminate the menace of terrorism from its soil and take action against its supporters, abettors and financiers.In the long statement, the spokesperson said that for the past four years, since the Taliban regime came to power in Afghanistan, there has been a sharp surge in terrorist attacks emanating from Afghan soil.""Throughout these years, Pakistan, despite suffering military and civilian casualties, exercised maximum restraint and did not retaliate,"" it said.Pakistan's expectation was that the Taliban regime would be able to control these attacks and take concrete actions against the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan/Fitna al Khawarij (TTP/FaK) elements present on Afghan soil, the FO said.The Pakistan government last year notified the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) as ""Fitna al-Khawarij"", a reference to a group in earlier Islamic history which was involved in violence.Pakistan also tried to positively engage with Afghanistan by offering bilateral trade concessions and humanitarian assistance, and the intention to constructively engage with Afghanistan so as to enable it to become a stable, peaceful and prosperous country that is at peace within and with its neighbours, the statement said.However, despite all these positive gestures, ""the response from the Taliban regime has only been hollow promises and inaction,"" it added.Instead of acting upon the core expectation to stop Afghan territory from being used for attacks against Pakistan, the Taliban regime has always tried to shy away from taking concrete and verifiable actions, it said.""Instead, it has tried to confuse the main issue with other relatively irrelevant and hypothetical issues. By confusing the main issue of terrorism, it keeps trying to develop a narrative which absolves the Taliban regime of its commitments and responsibilities towards the international community and its own people,"" it added.The statement said that Pakistan's October 2025 response to the consistent attacks emanating from Afghanistan was a manifestation of the will and determination that it will not leave any stone unturned to safeguard its territory and its people.The statement added that the Taliban regime was only interested in prolonging the temporary ceasefire, but without taking concrete and verifiable actions against the TTP/FaK terrorists.Pakistan also accused the Afghan Taliban of using the issue of Pakistani terrorists hiding in Afghanistan as a humanitarian issue, adding that they had fled in 2015 to avoid a military operation and fought together with the Afghan Taliban against Nato troops.""These terrorists and their families are now being harboured by the Taliban regime as a payback for their allegiance to the Afghan Taliban,"" it said, and added that the same terrorists established training camps in Afghanistan to launch terrorist activities in Pakistan.The FO rejected the Kabul excuse of lack of control over TTP and demanded definite and concrete actions. Pakistan also rejected the portrayal of TTP as refugees and asked Kabul to hand them over to Pakistan.It said Pakistan has never eschewed dialogue with any Government in Kabul, but it would not hold dialogue with any terrorist group.",Pakistan says it is committed to dialogue to resolve differences with the Afghan Taliban. Foreign Office says Kabul must address concerns regarding the use of its territory by terrorists. Peace talks ended without any agreement to tackle the thorny issues of cross-border terrorism.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125212578,imgsize-641343,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-32.jpg"

Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Powers Set To Grow As Shehbaz Govt Mulls 27th Constitution Amendment

What does it mean?



Opposition backlash and protests



Divided legal opinions



Support for reforms







Pakistan’s government has introduced a major constitutional change that has sparked widespread debate and protests across the country. The proposed 27th constitutional amendment, which will be voted on in Parliament next week, seeks to restructure the military’s chain of command and overhaul the judiciary, prompting strong criticism from the Opposition.The current move mirrors the era of General Zia-ul-Haq, Pakistan’s longest-serving de facto head of state, who introduced sweeping constitutional changes to entrench military control under a civilian façade. The proposed 27th Amendment, risks reviving that legacy by placing the armed forces once again at the centre of Pakistan’s political structure.The bill, tabled in the Senate on Saturday after cabinet approval, proposes to abolish the post of chairman joint chiefs of staff committee (CJCSC) and replace it with a new and more powerful position -- chief of defence forces (CDF).According to reports in Dawn, the post will be held by the serving chief of army staff, who will also become the constitutional head of the army, navy and air force. This change would make General Asim Munir the most powerful military officer in Pakistan’s history, formalising his recent promotion to Field Marshal.The amendment also includes plans to set up a new federal constitutional court (FCC) and change how high court judges are appointed.It seeks to transfer some powers from the Supreme Court to the new court, while also granting the president lifelong immunity from criminal prosecution.Pakistan law minister Azam Nazir Tarar presented the bill in the senate, where chairman Yusuf Raza Gilani referred it to a committee led by Farooq Naek for review. Naek said the goal was to “create consensus among members” before the bill comes up for voting on Monday. The government is confident of securing a two-thirds majority in both the senate and the national assembly.Opposition parties have strongly opposed the amendment, calling it a direct threat to Pakistan’s Constitution. A coalition of opposition groups, the Tehreek-e-Tahafuz Ayeen-e-Pakistan (TTAP), which includes Imran Khan’s PTI, Majlis Wahdat-e-Muslimeen (MWM), Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP), Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) and the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) has announced nationwide protests starting Sunday.“Democratic institutions have been paralysed within Pakistan… the nation must step up against the [proposed] 27th Amendment,” MWM chief Allama Raja Nasir Abbas said.PkMAP leader Mahmood Khan Achakzai said the protests would begin with the slogan: “Long live democracy, down with dictatorship.” He warned, “The opposition alliance had no choice but to launch a protest movement following the government’s move, which is shaking the foundations of the Constitution.”Legal experts are split on the amendment’s impact. Critics say it would reduce the powers of the Supreme Court, making it “irrelevant,” and tighten executive control over the judiciary.One senior counsel told Dawn, “Left with a limited jurisdiction of deciding ordinary civil, criminal and statutory appeals, the Supreme Court has now become all the more a ‘Supreme District Court’.”Former additional attorney general Tariq Mehmood Khokhar warned that the changes would “empower [the new] Federal Constitutional Court by disempowering the Supreme Court.” He said the amendment also gives the Chief of the Defence Forces constitutional authority for life, formally recognising the Field Marshal rank.Another lawyer pointed out that under the new Article 175A, the chief justice of the FCC would outrank the chief justice of the Supreme Court of Pakistan and serve until the age of 68 -- three years longer than the current limit of 65.Some legal experts, however, have welcomed the changes. Senior counsel Hafiz Ahsaan Ahmad Khokhar called the 27th Amendment “a major and long-awaited structural shift” in Pakistan’s justice system.He said the plan to have two separate apex courts -- one for appeals (Supreme Court) and one for constitutional cases (FCC) -- would bring “greater clarity, efficiency and constitutional coherence.”He also argued that the reforms could reduce political influence in the judiciary, cut down case backlogs, and modernise the justice system.Khokhar added that the new defence structure under Article 243 was in line with “modern constitutional democracies,” ensuring that the armed forces would operate under a single advisory framework accountable to the prime minister, defence minister and National Security Committee.Newly elected Supreme Court Bar Association in Pakistan, President Haroonur Rasheed also supported the creation of a Federal Constitutional Court, saying it could help streamline the judicial process.","Proposed 27th constitutional amendment will be voted on in Parliament next week.

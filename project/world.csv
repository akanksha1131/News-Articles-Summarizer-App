'Pandering to black people': Megyn Kelly has a meltdown over Met Gala’s ‘dandyism’ tribute,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/pandering-to-black-people-megyn-kelly-has-melt-down-over-met-galas-dandyism-tribute/articleshow/120982200.cms,"Megyn Kelly Declares ""The Met Gala is Dead"" and Calls Out Obscene Nudity and ""Rosa Parks on Crotch""





Megyn Kelly launched into a furious tirade against the 2025 Met Gala, slamming the prestigious fashion event as a “wannabe version of its old self” and accusing organisers of pandering to Black Americans with an “incomprehensible” theme.Speaking on Tuesday’s episode of The Megyn Kelly Show, the former Fox News anchor took aim at the gala’s theme “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,” which celebrated Black dandyism and its influence on fashion. Kelly ridiculed the concept as elitist and politically driven, dismissing it as “leftist academic, gobbledygook, nonsensical talk.”“Once the apex of high fashion culture and A-list celebrity, the gala now looks more like a sad sack D-list past-its-prime wannabe version of its old self,” she said. “It’s closer to today’s Nerd Prom White House Correspondents Dinner than the centre of the celeb and beauty universe as it used to be.”Kelly openly mocked the theme’s intellectual basis, referencing Monica Miller’s 2009 book Slaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity, which inspired the Met exhibit. “So far we have dandyism, intersection and diasporic identity,” Kelly said. “We’re batting a thousand on the scale of leftist code language that will make liberals sound smarter and feel superior.”She went on to quote Miller’s description of Black dandyism, before blasting it as purposefully obtuse: “The whole point is to lose you and sound smarter than you by saying words that are totally empty and meaningless,” she said.Kelly accused the event of virtue-signalling, saying the gala’s true intent was to “pander to Black people because we love Black people and that makes us good people.” She described the night as “basically Black Lives Matter at the Met,” calling it “a parade of Black Americans, leftists in their dandy style.”“Near as I can figure,” she added, “it appears to mean over-the-top black and white with weird shapes and vaginas showing.”The annual Met Gala, co-chaired this year by stars like Colman Domingo, Pharrell Williams and Lewis Hamilton, was otherwise hailed by fashion critics for celebrating the elegance and defiance of Black style throughout history. But Kelly dismissed the celebration entirely, describing it as a self-congratulatory gathering of elites.“You’re not meant to understand this,” she concluded. “You dumbasses. You have to go to Harvard to understand what these people are saying, how they speak and how they code talk.”The Met Gala reportedly raised $31 million this year.","Megyn Kelly slammed the 2025 Met Gala as a ""wannabe version of its old self"" The former Fox News anchor accused the event of pandering to Black Americans with an ""incomprehensible"" theme.

Over 50 students arrested in pro-Palestinian protest at Columbia University,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/over-50-students-arrested-in-pro-palestinian-protest-at-columbia-university/articleshow/120981871.cms,"Over 50 students arrested in pro-Palestinian protest at Columbia University (Picture credit: NYT)





Over 50 pro-Palestinian demonstrators were arrested Wednesday evening after occupying a reading room in Columbia University’s Butler Library, in a protest that reignited tensions over the Gaza war on US campuses.The occupation began around 3 pm (local time), when masked protesters, many wearing keffiyehs, stormed into the second-floor reading room of Butler Library.Videos shared online showed students chanting “We have nothing to lose but our chains!” while declaring the area a “liberated zone” and renaming it the “Basel Al-Araj Popular University.”Al-Araj was a Palestinian activist killed by Israeli forces in 2017.Protesters draped banners reading “Strike for Gaza,” stood on desks using megaphones, and distributed pamphlets calling for Columbia to divest from firms allegedly profiting from Israel’s military campaign.Some demonstrators defaced library walls and tables, according to New York Post, while one sign inside reportedly read “Columbia Will Burn.”University officials initially deployed campus security, warning students they could face disciplinary action and arrest if they didn’t leave.But when protesters refused to show identification and described being “kettled” inside, the standoff escalated.Acting Columbia president Claire Shipman then requested the NYPD’s intervention.""Requesting the presence of the NYPD is not the outcome we wanted, but it was absolutely necessary to secure the safety of our community,"" Shipman said in a statement quoted by The New York Times.The university reported that two public safety officers were injured in a crowd surge. Protesters also claimed some injuries, with one seen leaving on a stretcher, partially covered, with an ice pack on their arm.The NYPD arrived in riot gear around 7 pm (local time), entering the library and arresting 75 individuals, according to The Guardian. Video footage showed protesters being led out in zip ties and loaded into waiting buses. A message sent to students at 6 pm (local time) had warned that the library was closed and the area “must be cleared.”New York Mayor Eric Adams called the protest “unacceptable” and was quoted by NBC as saying that the NYPD acted upon a written request from the university. “We will never tolerate lawlessness,” he said in a later statement, adding that protesters who are not affiliated with Columbia should leave or face arrest. Governor Kathy Hochul also weighed in, saying, “Everyone has the right to peacefully protest. But violence, vandalism or destruction of property are completely unacceptable. ”US secretary of state Marco Rubio said the visa status of international students involved in the protest would be reviewed, calling the demonstrators “pro-Hamas thugs” in a statement. Jewish student groups also criticised the protest, with one group sharing an image of the vandalised library and saying it was ""unacceptable to have fully masked strangers barging into learning institutions.""The protest comes as Columbia faces pressure from the Trump administration, which cut over $400 million in federal research funding due to the university’s alleged failure to protect Jewish students.As per The New York Times, officials are currently in talks to restore that funding. The university on Tuesday announced layoffs of nearly 180 staff, largely tied to research grants affected by the cuts.The Butler Library protest echoed last spring’s occupation of Hamilton Hall and a broader encampment movement on US campuses. Since then, Columbia has tightened security, banned masks during demonstrations, and authorised 36 campus safety officers to make arrests.As per The Guardian, Columbia’s leadership has seen multiple changes amid backlash over the administration’s perceived compliance with federal demands that critics argue threaten academic freedom.Columbia University Apartheid Divest(CUAD), which organised Wednesday’s action, has drawn criticism for supporting armed resistance. The group’s latest statement called on students “to propagate the successes of the heroic Palestinian armed resistance in weakening Israel and US imperialism.”As final exams approach, university officials have pledged consequences. “Disruptions to our academic activities will not be tolerated,” said Shipman. “This is especially unacceptable while our students study and prepare for final exams.”","Over 50 students arrested in pro-Palestinian protest at Columbia University.

Florida Senator Ileana Garcia experienced a medical scare during a press conference on Tuesday but quickly recovered thanks to the swift action of Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo , who caught her just as she began to faint on stage.The incident occurred in Miami, where Senator Garcia had joined Governor Ron DeSantis and other state officials to discuss plans for a statewide ban on water fluoridation, according to the New York Post.While delivering her remarks, Garcia suddenly paused, swallowed hard, and told the governor, “Governor, forgive me, I’ve got to sit down, because I am not feeling well.”Moments later, she lost her balance and collapsed.But Dr Ladapo, who was seated nearby, quickly rushed to her side and caught her before she could hit the ground. “Hey, hey, hey, hey, got you, got you, got you,” Ladapo was heard saying, as he gently guided the senator into a chair.Garcia remained seated as Governor DeSantis and others brought her water and tried to cool her down. Within minutes, she had composed herself and returned to the podium, to a warm round of applause from the audience.“Are you kidding, this was my moment? I could not,” Garcia joked, drawing laughter from the crowd. “Nerve wracking, but this was my moment. And I so appreciate your grace, Governor DeSantis.”She completed her speech without further incident.Following her address, Miami-Dade Commissioner Roberto Gonzalez applauded her resilience and said, “Absolutely nothing is going to stop that woman from fighting for the people of Florida.”","Florida Senator Ileana Garcia experienced a medical scare during a press conference on Tuesday but quickly recovered thanks to the swift action of Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo.

ISLAMABAD: Hours after Operation Sindoor Pakistan PM Shahbaz Sharif , while addressing a session of parliament on Wednesday, lauded his country’s army for its ‘swift response’ to Indian strikes and claimed that it had shot down five jets of the neighbouring country. However, he did not provide any evidence to back his claim.A Pakistani army spokesperson said at least 26 people were killed and 46 were injured in Indian strikes on six locations past midnight in PoK and the Punjab province. Pakistan’s military spokesperson, Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, said 13 deaths were reported in Bahawalpur’s Ahmedpur East, claiming that the Subhan Allah mosque was attacked. Other casualties were reported from PoK’s Kotli, Muzaffarabad and Mirpur districts and Muridke in Punjab.In Parliament, Sharif alleged that India had responded with ‘aggression’ despite Pakistan’s ‘offer’ for a transparent international probe into the Pahalgam massacre. He said 80 Indian aircraft were part of the offensive, but Pakistan’s air defence ‘effectively neutralised’ the threat. He claimed that Pakistan’s military had ‘prior intelligence’ about India’s plans.Earlier, at an emergency meeting of National Security Committee (NSC), which was chaired by Sharif and attended by top military and civilian leaders, Pakistan condemned India’s coordinated attacks as ‘acts of war’.NSC directed the armed forces to deliver a “befitting response to the unprovoked strikes”.Accusing New Delhi of “igniting an inferno in the region”, NSC said in a statement that “the responsibility for ensuing consequences shall lie squarely with India”.NSC warned that in consonance with Article 51 of the UN Charter, Islamabad reserved its right to respond in self-defence “at a time, place, and manner of its choosing” to avenge the loss of “innocent Pakistani lives” in the Indian strikes. The Pakistani nation, the statement added, stands “galvanised and resolute”, rallying behind its armed forces’ courage.NSC alleged that Indian strikes deliberately targeted civilian areas “on the false pretext of presence of imaginary terrorist camps”.Pakistan’s foreign minister Ishaq Dar said Islamabad had exercised restraint in the face of New Delhi’s strikes.Meanwhile, Dar briefed Chinese ambassador to Pakistan, Jiang Zaidong, who called on the former after the Indian strikes, according to the Foreign Office. “The two sides exchanged views on regional security developments and agreed to maintain close coordination and communication across all relevant areas,” Foreign Office said in a statement.",PM Shahbaz Sharif lauded his country’s army for its ‘swift response’ to Indian strikes and claimed that it had shot down five jets.

'Canada largest client of US': Mark Carney fact-checks Donald Trump in first meeting at White House,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/canada-largest-client-of-us-mark-carney-fact-checks-donald-trump-in-first-meeting-at-white-house/articleshow/120957938.cms,"US President Donald Trump meets Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington. (Picture credit: AP)

Poll Do you think Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney effectively countered President Trump's claims about trade during their meeting? Yes, he did a great job. No, he could have done better.





What began as a standard diplomatic visit quickly turned into a high-stakes exchange when Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney fact-checked US President Donald Trump during their first official meeting at the White House on Tuesday.As cameras rolled in the Oval Office, Trump downplayed Canada’s trade significance to the United States, claiming, “We don’t do much business with Canada from our standpoint. They do a lot of business with us. We’re at like 4%.”But Carney, calm and composed, stepped in firmly.“Respectfully, Canadians’ view on this is not going to change on the 51st state,” Carney said, referring to his early days in office and Trump’s earlier remark about annexing Canada. He continued, “We are the largest client of the United States in the totality of all the goods.”As reported by CNN, Trump’s “4%” figure is false. In reality, Canada purchased about 17% of all US goods exports in February and March 2025, according to official US trade data—more than any other country. In total, Canada bought around $440 billion worth of US goods and services in 2024, making it the top destination for American exports, as confirmed by the US trade representative.Carney, pressing the point further, highlighted how deeply integrated both nations’ economies are. “We have a tremendous auto sector between the two of us. You know, 50% of a car that comes from Canada is American. That’s not like anywhere else in the world,” he said.According to the AP, Carney also stood firm on Canada’s sovereignty when Trump floated the idea of annexing Canada. “Some places are never for sale,” he told Trump directly. “Canada is one of them. And it won’t be for sale, ever.”Trump smirked and replied, “Never say never,” to which Carney responded with a quiet but resolute “Never, never, never.”Despite the tension, Trump appeared to appreciate Carney’s straightforward approach. “I like this guy,” the president said as the meeting wrapped up, a remark that seemed to signal respect more than irritation.But the session was emblematic of how Oval Office meetings have changed under Trump. As reported by AP, these events have evolved from formal photo ops into unpredictable exchanges where foreign leaders must choose between confrontation and diplomacy.During the meeting, Trump also wandered into unrelated topics, including complaints about California’s rail project, jabs at Barack Obama’s library, and a sudden announcement to halt bombing in Yemen, leaving Carney visibly uneasy.At one point, the Canadian leader’s lips tightened and his hands remained clasped as he struggled to reinsert the conversation into serious policy territory.Trump also repeated a long-debunked claim, stating that the US was “subsidising Canada to the tune of maybe $200 billion per year.”However, the actual US trade deficit with Canada in 2024 was about $36 billion, far from Trump’s exaggerated number, reported CNN. Even when counting only goods, the gap was around $71 billion, not a subsidy and nowhere near $200 billion.","Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney fact-checked US President Donald Trump during their first official meeting at the White House.

'I see Kash Patel every day in office': Pushback against claims that FBI chief is spotted more at nightclubs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/i-see-kash-patel-at-office-every-day-pushback-against-claims-that-fbi-chief-is-spotted-more-at-nightclubs/articleshow/120971078.cms,"FBI staff calls Kash Patel-nightclub claims false, says he sees Patel every day at the FBI office.

Morning Joe forced to add clarification on Kash Patel-night club claim







FBI spokesperson Ben Williamson slammed former FBI official Frank Figliuzzi for claiming that Kash Patel is seen more at night clubs than in the office, and said Figliuzzi has made up everything he said. The comment came at MSNBC's Morning Joe program, which too issued a clarification about the viral claim and said that it was not verified by MSNBC.Figliuzzi claimed that he got to know that Kash Patel is visible at nightclubs far more than he has been on the seventh floor of the Hoover building. He also claimed that Patel reduced the frequency of briefings -- from daily briefings to twice weekly. He claimed that Patel works from Las Vegas home mostly as he is splitting his time between DC and Las Vegas.Williamson, assistant director for public affairs at the FBI, said Figluizii made up both the nightclub and the Las Vegas part because Kash went home for a total of three days since he became the FBI director. ""Bogus. Kash has been Director for 70+ days and has been home for a total of three days. I see him here at HQ every day,"" Williamson said.Host Jonathan Lemire on Monday referred to the Kash Patel-nightclub claim that was made on Friday's show and said: ""Let's circle back to a segment from Friday’s show.Frank Figliuzzi was on that morning during this hour, discussing the work of administration officials.""“At the end of that segment, Figliuzzi said that FBI director Kash Patel has reportedly been more visible at nightclubs than at his office at FBI headquarters. This was a misstatement. We have not verified that claim.”The claim went viral as Kash Patel was already on the radar for his usage of FBI jets for personal trips. Senate Democrats have asked the U.S. Government Accountability Office to review the FBI Director Kash Patel's personal travel on government aircraft, CBS reported.","FBI spokesperson Ben Williamson slammed former FBI official Frank Figliuzzi for claiming that Kash Patel is seen more at night clubs than in the office.

Police are searching for at least two suspects, believed to be high school students, though it remains unclear whether they attend Santa Ana High.While the motive has not been confirmed, investigators suspect the violence may be gang-related. The Santa Ana Unified School District assured parents there is no ongoing threat to the school or surrounding community.All after-school activities were cancelled following the incident, and crisis counsellors will be available for students on Thursday.

Fed holds rates, warns of uncertainty





President Donald Trump has said that he will reveal details of a major new trade deal at a press conference scheduled for 10.00am tomorrow (local time) in the Oval Office. In a post on Truth Social, Trump described the agreement as involving representatives of a “big, and highly respected, country,” and called it “the first of many. ”""Big News Conference tomorrow morning at 10:00 A.M., The Oval Office, concerning a MAJOR TRADE DEAL WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF A BIG, AND HIGHLY RESPECTED, COUNTRY,"" Trump said in his post.The timing of the announcement also coincides with the start of US-China talks in Switzerland, the first formal dialogue since the trade war escalated. Yet Trump remains adamant that the US is not seeking talks from a position of weakness. “They said we initiated [the talks]? I think they ought to go back and study their files,” he said in response to Chinese claims.While Trump has not yet disclosed the name of the country involved, the announcement comes amid renewed tensions over trade, particularly with China. “We were losing a trillion dollars a year, now we’re not losing anything,” he said earlier this week, ruling out any reduction in tariffs for now.Uncertainty remains over how any new trade deal might be structured. Trump has suggested that his administration has been approached by nearly all major trading partners with potential agreements, but he insists any final deal must serve American interests first. “We could sign 25 deals tomorrow if we wanted,” he said, adding that tariffs remain a tool he’s willing to keep using to leverage better terms.The US Federal Reserve has held interest rates steady, keeping its benchmark rate between 4.25% and 4.50%, amid rising concerns over inflation and employment pressures. The pause, announced Wednesday, comes as the economic impact of President Donald Trump’s sweeping new tariffs continues to unfold. Fed Chair Jerome Powell cited “a great deal of uncertainty” around the administration’s trade policies, which have led to volatility in financial markets and warnings from analysts of higher inflation and unemployment.Trump’s tariffs, including steep levies on Chinese goods and 10% duties on imports from other nations, have shaken investor confidence and raised concerns over future economic growth. While hard data shows the economy has remained resilient, softer indicators point to declining consumer confidence and expectations of rising inflation.The Fed faces a delicate balancing act as it monitors these developments. Despite public criticism from Trump urging rate cuts, Powell insisted the Fed remains focused solely on economic data. Analysts now expect any rate cuts to be delayed, with some predicting the first adjustment in September.Adding to the economic uncertainty is Trump's proposal for 100% tariffs on foreign films. While unlikely to materialise, the idea underscores wider industry turmoil. Hollywood, long anchored in Los Angeles, is losing ground to international production hubs offering generous tax incentives. With filming in LA at historic lows, California officials are pushing to expand state tax credits to keep production local, though competition from abroad continues to grow.","Trump to announce details of major new trade deal at 10.00am tomorrow.

Trump administration invokes state secrets privilege in deportation case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-administration-invokes-state-secrets-privilege-in-deportation-case-of-kilmar-abrego-garcia/articleshow/120979986.cms,"File photo: US President Donald Trump (right) and Kilmar Abrego Garcia (Picture credit: AP)





The Trump administration has formally invoked the state secrets privilege in a contentious legal fight over the wrongful deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, according to multiple court filings, reported CBS News.US district Judge Paula Xinis disclosed the invocation in a new order, calling on both the government and Abrego Garcia’s legal team to submit legal briefs by Monday explaining the basis for invoking the state secrets and deliberative process privileges.A hearing on the matter is scheduled for May 16 in Greenbelt, Maryland.As reported by CBS News, the justice department had previously signalled its intent to shield documents using attorney-client privilege, executive privilege, and the state secrets privilege. Judge Xinis has demanded that each claim be justified in detail before she determines their validity.This latest assertion comes amid a heated discovery process, with Xinis earlier accusing the administration of a “willful and bad faith refusal to comply” with court orders.The case stems from the erroneous deportation of Abrego Garcia in March, despite a 2019 legal order protecting him from removal due to threats from gangs in El Salvador.Trump administration has claimed Abrego Garcia is affiliated with MS-13, based largely on allegations from a confidential informant. His lawyers strongly deny these claims, asserting that he has never been charged or convicted of any crimes in any country.The Supreme Court had ruled that the administration must facilitate his return to the US and handle his case as if the deportation had never happened. However, the administration has pushed back, arguing it lacks jurisdiction and claiming that Abrego Garcia’s release now depends on El Salvador.Xinis had initially granted expedited discovery, allowing depositions of four top officials from the homeland security and state departments. However, after sealed filings were submitted, she temporarily paused the process, only to lift the stay days later.Some of the records the court had demanded were never turned over.The administration’s use of the state secrets privilege marks the second time it has deployed the measure in recent weeks in deportation-related litigation. According to Politico, the privilege was also used in a separate case before US district judge James Boasberg regarding deportations to El Salvador conducted under a little-used presidential war power.Judge Xinis has also agreed to hear arguments later this month on a motion by news organisations seeking to unseal the court documents submitted under seal, with a deadline for briefing set for May 27.As of April 21, Abrego Garcia had been transferred from El Salvador’s controversial Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT) to a lower-security facility in Santa Ana, according to a state department declaration.The Trump administration continues to insist it is unable to facilitate his return, despite the Supreme Court's directive.In her latest order, Xinis made clear that she expects complete legal and factual justifications from the administration for its privilege claims, as the court moves closer to resolving the dispute over whether classified or privileged information can be withheld in a case involving what federal authorities themselves called an “administrative error.”","Kilmar Abrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador in March, despite a 2019 legal order protecting him from removal due to threats from gangs in El Salvador.

Two officers injured as pro-Palestinian protesters occupy Columbia University library: What we know so far,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/two-officers-injured-as-pro-palestinian-protesters-occupy-columbia-university-library-what-we-know-so-far/articleshow/120979997.cms,"Here are the key developments:

Demonstrators affiliated with Columbia University Apartheid Divest (CUAD) flooded Butler Library just after 3 p.m., chanting pro-Palestinian slogans and carrying signs. CUAD called the protest a disruption against Columbia's ties to ""imperialist violence.""

NYPD officers entered the building after requests from Columbia officials. The decision was made amid safety concerns due to a growing crowd and resistance from those inside the library.

Two university public safety officers were injured in what Shipman described as a ""crowd surge"" when individuals attempted to break into the building.

Protesters clashed with public safety officers, with pushing and shoving on both sides. Protesters attempting to exit the library were blocked by officers. At one point, officers secured interior doors using handcuffs to prevent further entry.

CUAD demanded full divestment from companies tied to the Israeli state and military. In an online post, they declared their intention to continue disrupting campus life until Columbia meets their demands.

The protest coincided with federal hate crime charges being brought against 20-year-old Tarek Bazrouk, accused of assaults during previous pro-Palestinian protests in New York, including one near Columbia. He remains in custody awaiting a bail hearing.

The university has faced mounting pressure from the Trump administration and conservative lawmakers to crack down on what they claim is rising antisemitism on campus. In April, student demonstrators barricaded themselves in Hamilton Hall, resulting in arrests and disciplinary action.

Following previous unrest, Columbia hired new security personnel authorised to make arrests and tightened protest regulations in line with federal demands.

Mayor Adams reiterated the city's commitment to safety and lawful protest, stating on social media that Columbia students must be able to study without intimidation or violence.





Two public safety officers were injured on Wednesday during chaotic scenes at Columbia University after pro-Palestinian demonstrators occupied the university’s Butler Library. The protesters, most wearing masks and keffiyehs, stormed the building’s main reading room, renaming it “the Basel Al-Araj Popular University,” and unfurled banners, including some with Palestinian flags. Columbia’s acting president Claire Shipman said the students refused repeated requests to identify themselves or leave the premises, prompting the university to call in the New York Police Department.Videos circulated on social media showed NYPD officers in riot helmets entering the library around 7pm, several hours after the protest began. They were seen removing demonstrators, with at least 21 being escorted out in flex cuffs. Protesters had earlier forced their way past campus security, some reportedly shouting slogans and hanging banners declaring the space a ""Liberated Zone."" Graffiti, including the phrase ""Columbia will burn,"" was seen scrawled on framed pictures in the reading room.The clash marks the latest flashpoint in an ongoing dispute between Columbia University and pro-Palestinian student groups, who have accused the institution of supporting ""imperialist violence"" through its investments.The Trump administration has previously threatened to withhold more than \$400 million in federal research funding from the university, citing its alleged failure to protect Jewish students from harassment. The university has since implemented stricter protest policies, including a ban on face coverings and a requirement for students to show ID when protesting on campus.New York City Mayor Eric Adams defended the police response, stating that the city supports peaceful protest but will not tolerate “lawlessness.” He reaffirmed support for Jewish students on campus and said any non-student protester would be arrested.","Protesters clashed with public safety officers, with pushing and shoving on both sides.

President Donald Trump has withdrawn his nomination of Dr Janette Nesheiwat as the next US Surgeon General following a fierce campaign led by conservative firebrand Laura Loomer. The move, announced just a day before Nesheiwat’s scheduled Senate confirmation hearing, marks a striking example of the growing influence of MAGA-aligned influencers on key administration decisions.Trump confirmed on Truth Social that Dr Casey Means will replace Nesheiwat as his new choice for Surgeon General, praising Means' ""impeccable ‘MAHA’ credentials"" and lauding her academic background and dedication to reversing the chronic disease epidemic. “Dr. Casey Means has the potential to be one of the finest Surgeon Generals in United States History,” Trump wrote. He added that Nesheiwat would instead take on a senior role within the Department of Health and Human Services under Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.The abrupt switch comes after Loomer launched a public campaign against Nesheiwat, questioning her medical credentials and attacking her previous support for COVID-19 vaccines . Loomer criticised Nesheiwat for earning her degree from the American University of the Caribbean, not the University of Arkansas as had been implied, and for being board-certified in family medicine rather than emergency medicine. Loomer also cited a medical malpractice case involving Nesheiwat and accused her of misleading the public about her background.In 2021, Nesheiwat described COVID-19 vaccines as “a gift from God” in a Fox News op-ed and promoted widespread vaccination. Though she later opposed vaccine mandates for children, Loomer argued that her earlier stance disqualified her from holding a top public health role in a post-pandemic MAGA administration. Loomer framed her opposition as part of a broader ideological struggle within Trump’s movement, declaring it a new “civil war” over loyalty to America First principles.Nesheiwat responded diplomatically, saying she remains committed to supporting President Trump’s health agenda. “My focus continues to be on improving the health and well-being of all Americans, and that mission hasn’t changed,” she posted on X.Trump had previously praised Nesheiwat in his November announcement, calling her “a fierce advocate and strong communicator for preventive medicine and public health.” Her frontline experience during the pandemic and frequent media presence had made her a prominent candidate.",Dr Janette Nesheiwat had been nominated to be the next US Surgeon General.

New York police officers entered Columbia University ’s Butler Library on Wednesday evening after a group of pro-Palestinian demonstrators occupied the building, escalating tensions on a campus already under federal scrutiny for protest-related policies.The standoff began around 3:30 p.m. when Columbia University Apartheid Divest ( CUAD ), a pro-Palestinian student group, rallied supporters online, urging them to ""reclaim"" the library’s main reading room, which they renamed the “Basel Al-Araj Popular University” in honour of a Palestinian writer and activist. Masked protesters flooded the room, unfurled Palestinian flags, and defaced furniture and framed portraits with slogans such as “Columbia will burn” and “Free Gaza.”The university responded by repeatedly asking those involved to present identification and vacate the premises, warning that non-compliance would lead to arrests. Videos circulated on social media show scuffles at the entrance to the library, with protesters refusing to show ID and chanting “Let us go!” as campus security blocked others from joining the occupation.By early evening, Columbia University President Claire Shipman confirmed that NYPD officers had been called in “to assist in securing the building and the safety of our community.”Around 60 protesters were led out of the library in zip ties, some resisting removal. The university also reported that two of its public safety officers were injured during what it described as a “crowd surge.”Columbia condemned the disruptions, calling them unacceptable especially during final exams. The school also criticised acts of antisemitism, hate, and violence that occurred during the protest. In an internal alert, it advised students to avoid the area and confirmed the library’s closure.The demonstration came just two days after Israel’s cabinet approved a full military takeover of Gaza, and as the Trump administration pushes for stronger federal oversight of universities accused of harbouring antisemitism. Columbia, which was stripped of federal funds earlier this year, recently agreed to a series of reforms including bans on protester face coverings, compulsory ID checks during demonstrations, and the hiring of 36 new security officers authorised to make arrests.Meanwhile, federal prosecutors announced hate crime charges against 20-year-old Tarek Bazrouk, who is accused of attacking Jewish individuals at previous pro-Palestinian rallies in New York, including one near Columbia. His lawyer said they intend to vigorously defend the case.CUAD issued a defiant statement online, warning that “repression breeds resistance” and calling for full divestment from Israel and amnesty for all disciplined students.","Protesters flooded the main reading room of Columbia University's Butler Library.

NEW DELHI: Fresh satellite images released on Thursday revealed the scale of destruction caused after Indian Army carried out precision strikes at 9 terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, under 'Operation Sindoor'.The comparative satellite images, released by Maxar Technologies, showed substantial structural damage across critical locations, specifically targeting the Jamia Mosque in Bahawalpur and within Muridke city in Pakistan.The complex, spread across 82 acres, was the 'alma mater' and the most important training centre of LeT located in Nangal Sahdan, Muridke, Sheikhupura, Punjab, Pakistan.Similarly, Jamia Mosque in Bahawalpur indicates evident destruction, with imagery analysis between pre-strike conditions and subsequent post-strike visuals.Markaz Subhan Allah was located at NH-5 (Karachi-Torkham Highway) on the outskirts of Bahawalpur at Karachi Mor in Bahawalpur district of Pakistan's Punjab province. This was the main centre of Jaish-e-Mohammed for training and indoctrination of youth which is spread over a 15-acre area.The Indian Army conducted targeted strikes, eliminating nine terrorist bases belonging to Jaish-e-Mohammed, Lashkar-e-Taiba, and Hizbul Mujahideen during 'Operation Sindoor' across Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir.The Indian Air Force executed precise attacks on four sites within Pakistan's borders, whilst five locations were targeted in Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir.

Prolonged tension to hurt Pakistan's economy: Moody's,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/prolonged-tension-to-hurt-pak-eco-moodys/articleshow/120913945.cms,"



NEW DELHI: A sustained escalation in tension with India could hurt Pakistan's growth, impact its fiscal consolidation and macroeconomic stability, Moody's Rating warned on Monday. In contrast, it does not expect a significant impact on India, apart from higher defence spending weighing on govt's fiscal consolidation plan.Pakistan was on the brink of bankruptcy until the International Monetary Fund bailed it out once again, provided it met several conditions. Its credit rating, Caa2+ according to Moody's, is speculative grade, signalling its weak fundamentals.""Pakistan's macroeconomic conditions have been improving, with growth gradually rising, inflation declining and foreign-exchange reserves increasing, amid continued progress in the IMF programme. A persistent increase in tensions could also impair Pakistan's access to external financing and pressure its foreign-exchange reserves, which remain well below what is required to meet its external debt payment needs for the next few years,"" Moody's said.Apart from assistance from multilateral agencies, including IMF and the World Bank, Pakistan had also managed to roll over debt from Saudi Arabia, China and UAE to tide over the foreign exchange and debt crisis.The weak sentiments are also reflected in stock market indices. Pakistan's benchmark KSE-100 index fell another 635 points on May 5. Since April 23, the index has lost over 7,500 points, or 6% due to fears of a conflict.Indian markets have, however, held up. ""Comparatively, the macroeconomic conditions in India would be stable, bolstered by moderating but still high levels of growth, amid strong public investment and healthy private consumption. In a scenario of sustained escalation in localised tensions, we do not expect major disruptions to India's economic activity because it has minimal economic relations with Pakistan (less than 0.5% of India's total exports in 2024),"" Moody's said.Moody's is not budgeting for a broad-based military conflict. ""Our geopolitical risk assessment for Pakistan and India accounts for persistent tensions, which have, at times, led to limited military responses.

DHAKA : The interim govt, headed by Muhammad Yunus , is set to finalise an ordinance within a week that will abolish nine controversial provisions of the cyber security act-2023, including one related to the liberation war and father of the nation, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman One of the provisions abolished during the drafting of the new ordinance is punishment for carrying out any “hateful, misleading or defamatory propaganda” against the liberation war, the spirit of the liberation war, Mujibur Rahman, the national anthem, or the national flag.” Law adviser Asif Nazrul said this provision had often been misused in the past to “harass” people.At a meeting held Tuesday, the council of advisers approved the draft of the new ordinance, titled ‘Cyber Surokkha Adhyadesh-2025 (cyber protection ordinance-2025), fulfilling the interim govt’s promise to repeal the cyber security act-2023. Once vetted by the law ministry, the ordinance is expected to be formally gazetted and enforced within a week.Nazrul said the nine abolished provisions had accounted for 95 per cent of all cases previously filed under the 2023 act.These cases will be automatically cancelled once the new ordinance comes into effect. “When we first took office, we pledged to repeal the previous cyber security act and replace it with amodern law,” he said.For the first time, internet access will be officially recognized as a civil right in Bangladesh. The ordinance also clearly defines and criminalises online sexual harassment and the abuse of women and children. Apart from targeted abuse and hate speech, the ordinance removes provisions that penalise general opinions or speech.","The interim govt is set to finalise an ordinance within a week that will abolish nine controversial provisions of the cyber security act-2023.

The sedition case was lodged by Firoz Khan, former BNP general secretary of Chittagong's Mohora ward.Chinmoy was arrested at Dhaka's Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport on Nov 25.

Who is Chinmoy Krishna Das?

A Bangladesh court on Wednesday granted bail to former Iskcon leader Chinmoy Krishna Das in a sedition case , reported Bangladesh's The Daily Star.Das was arrested following a controversy that erupted when a sedition case was filed against him and 18 others in Chittagong on October 30 last year.The charges were linked to the hoisting of a saffron flag above Bangladesh's official flag during the October 25 rally at Laldighi Maidan in Chattogram.Das was presented before a Chittagong court on Tuesday, where his bail plea was denied, and he was sent into custody. The arrest has triggered widespread outrage, with many demanding his immediate release.Das serves as the spokesperson for the Bangladesh Sammilita Sanatani Jagran Jote , a group that champions the rights and security of minorities. He has been a vocal advocate for the Hindu (Sanatani) community in Bangladesh, calling for key reforms such as a minority protection law, a tribunal for fast-tracking cases of minority persecution, and the establishment of a dedicated ministry of minority affairs.He gained widespread attention for organising large public rallies, including one in Chittagong on October 25 and another in Rangpur on November 22, which sparked significant socio-political discussions across the country.Das hails from Satkania Upazila in Chittagong. From 2016 to 2022, he was the Chittagong divisional secretary of Iskcon. He gained popularity at an early age for his religious speeches and earned the nickname of ‘Shishu Bokta’, or ‘child orator’, reports Bangladeshi media.",Chinmoy Krishna Das is a former Iskcon leader.

Bangladesh Currency Crisis: Bangladesh faces currency crisis as central bank halts issuing notes featuring Mujibur Rahman,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-faces-currency-crisis-as-central-bank-halts-issuing-notes-featuring-mujibur-rahman/articleshow/120714882.cms,"Approximately Taka 15,000 crore worth of notes remain unused

DHAKA: The central bank of Bangladesh has apparently incurred a huge financial loss due to the interim govt’s decision not to issue previously printed notes, with approximately Taka 15,000 crore worth of paper notes featuring the image of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman remaining unused. The decision aligns with govt’s efforts to diminish Bangabandhu’s presence in public memory.Although bank officials are unwilling to discuss the matter publicly, many, on conditions of anonymity, said the longstanding tradition of obtaining new notes from Bangladesh Bank has been abruptly halted, creating a crisis in the market. On the one hand, the printed money is being wasted without use; on the other hand, customers are suffering as a result, they added.“Notes of various denominations are printed using paper and ink purchased with people’s taxes. Millions of notes with Bangabandhu’s picture are still lying in the vaults of various banks. The Security Printing Corporation does not have the capacity to cancel all the notes at once and print new ones. Therefore, notes with Bangabandhu’s picture cann’t be suddenly cancelled,” Ziauddin Ahmed, former executive director of Bangladesh Bank and former managing director of Security Printing Corporation, told reporters.In this situation, he suggested the printed notes be circulated in the market to alleviate public suffering. “When new design notes come into the market, the old ones should be gradually withdrawn. Generally, notes printed once can be used for a maximum of four to five years,” Ahmed said.According to media reports, Bangladesh Bank is unable to issue new notes to banks in line with demand. The crisis became evident following the country’s political upheaval in Aug last year.Since all forms of currency, including metal coins, feature Mujibur’s image, Bangladesh Bank abruptly stopped issuing new notes early April. As a result, the notes featuring Bangabandhu’s image are not reaching the market. Shops, banks, and citizens are now left with torn and old, dirty notes.According to sources at Bangladesh Bank, the Security Printing Corporation is set to begin printing new design notes next month. In the first phase, new design notes of 20, 50, and 1,000 taka will be printed and subsequently released in the market through banks.","Taka 15,000 crore worth of paper notes featuring the image of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman remain unused.

‘He’s basically blown it’: Insider says Prince Harry’s ties with royal family at breaking point,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/hes-basically-blown-it-insider-says-prince-harrys-ties-with-royal-family-at-breaking-point/articleshow/120979469.cms,"File photo: Prince Harry (Picture credit: AP)





Prince Harry’s ties with the royal family have reportedly hit rock bottom, with insiders claiming that neither King Charles nor other senior royals trust him or his wife, Meghan Markle. A close source cited by news outlet Page Six said, “I genuinely think nobody trusts him and that’s the bottom line. The royal family has major trust issues with him… maybe there’s room to forgive, but they won’t forget.”The growing estrangement was made starker after King Charles allegedly refused to meet Harry during his visit to the UK in April for the Invictus Games’ 10th anniversary. “Harry messaged Charles and he never heard back. He wanted to talk to his dad about security stuff then, but his dad wouldn’t speak to him,” the source said.Harry, 40, recently lost a Court of Appeal challenge over the UK government’s decision to strip him of publicly funded security. Reacting to the ruling, Harry said in an interview given to BBC News that he “can’t see a world” in which he would bring Meghan and their children, Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet, back to Britain.He added, “Charles won’t speak to me because of this security stuff… there have been so many disagreements between myself and some of my family.”The duke’s remarks about King Charles’s health also stirred outrage. Speaking to the BBC, he said he didn’t “know how much longer” his father has to live. Royal biographer Hugo Vickers wwas quoted by Page Six saying, “It was disgraceful to talk about Charles’s health… how does he know anything about it if he’s not talking to him?”Vickers said Harry’s actions echoed past royal missteps: “Charles is, of course, right not to trust him… Harry is hopeless in that respect.” He also criticised Harry for airing family matters publicly, saying, “Enough with the ‘me, me, me’ complaints. The king has got enough on his plate.”Adding further fuel to the fire, Harry’s BBC interview also included hints at a darker conspiracy, suggesting unnamed individuals may want “history to repeat itself” — a reference to Princess Diana’s death. Harry said, “Through the disclosure process, I’ve discovered that some people do want history to repeat itself, which is pretty dark.”When pressed to name those involved, he replied, “I’m not going to share that at this point. I know all the names of the people that were involved in this process.” He also claimed the royal family conspired with foreign governments to leave his family vulnerable, stating, “Not only did they decide to remove my security, but they also signalled to every single government around the world not to protect us.”Critics have accused Harry of using the security issue as a justification to stay away from future royal events, including potential funerals. Vickers remarked, “Harry should be begging his father for forgiveness… and it should be done quietly, not on TV. But he won’t. Because he’s so stupid, he’s basically blown it.”","Prince Harry’s ties with the royal family have reportedly hit rock bottom, with insiders claiming that neither King Charles nor other senior royals trust him or his wife, Meghan Markle.

TOI CORRESPONDENT FROM LONDON: Despite the rhetoric that tensions between India and Pakistan might spill over onto Britain’s streets, things were calm on Wednesday and members of the Indian and Pakistani diaspora were all still getting on with each other.“Our fight is not against any community, religion, or nationality — it is against terrorism and the nations that sponsor it,” said a spokesman for British Indians Voice. He said the diaspora supported India’s military strike. “India has shown restraint for decades. This was not a reckless strike — it was a measured and necessary response to repeated acts of terror emanating from Pakistani soil. We stand with our homeland. It is time for the world to unite against terror. Because silence is no longer an option.”British Indian Santosh Patil said: “Terrorism has no place in a civilised society and anywhere where terrorist sympathising groups are based should meet the same fate. British Indians feel it is the right thing that happened as India attacked a terrorist group. We are still getting on with British Pakistani friends and neighbours.This is not an attack on Pakistan but on terrorism.”Ganapati Bhat, Kannadigaruuk president, said: “The whole community have a sense of justice being done because it was the worst of kind of terrorist attack on 22nd April and India has been at the receiving end of terrorism since Independence. Retaliation was not there previously, except for a couple of instances, and this time they have done it very well and eliminated this terrorist infrastructure so we feel satisfied. There is a bit of worry that things could impact trust issues among communities but I think people view Pakistan and terrorists as separate things. These things have been happening for over a decade, so I don’t see it spilling over into UK’s streets.”Amjid Ali Akram Jarral Rajput, a British Kashmiri with roots in J&K, said: “It’s dreadful what has happened.” He has family on both sides of border. “This is just another way to escalate what is happening and bring the world’s attention to Kashmir. This is due to what Britain did and the mess it left Kashmir in.”British Pakistani Murtuza Ali Shah, bureau chief for Geo News in the UK, said: “British Pakistanis are worried about their families in the region.” He said he did not see tensions playing out on UK streets. “We have all lived here a long time and fought racism together.

TOI CORRESPONDENT FROM LONDON: The UK government has called on Pakistan to do more to tackle the terror threat within its own borders as ministers called for de-escalation and restraint on both sides.“Rising tensions between India and Pakistan will be of serious concern for many across Britain. We are engaging urgently with both countries and other international partners encouraging dialogue, escalation and the protection of civilians,” UK PM Keir Starmer said.“I have made clear to my counterparts in India and Pakistan that if this escalates further, nobody wins,” UK foreign secretary David Lammy added.Foreign office minister Hamish Falconer made a ministerial statement in the House of Commons on Wednesday, in which he called on India and Pakistan “to show restraint and engage in dialogue to find swift diplomatic path forward” .“Pakistan has been plagued by a terrorist threat within its own borders. It’s a plague that has been of concern to its neighbours but also most acutely to many Pakistanis as we have seen devastatingly in recent months. They must do more to tackle that threat,” Falconer said. “I have discussed that with Pakistani ministers through the course of my ministerial duties. India is right to feel outrage at this terrible attack on 22 April.There are now civilian casualties on both sides and it is vital we focus on de-escalation and try to restore calm and regional stability. Pakistan herself would most benefit from eradication of terrorism scourge within her borders.”Falconer told MPs that the UK had been in touch with both Pakistan and India since the strike and was working with the US and the Gulf to bring about de-escalation. “De-escalation is of utmost importance, not least because of the large number of British nationals in both countries,” Falconer said.MPs raised concerns about the impact on diaspora communities in the UK and their family members in the region. Many said the UK had a duty, given its unique relationship with both countries, to support mediation. MP Louie French called for Hindu temples to get the same funding and security given to mosques. Some called for the UK to take the matter up at the UNSC, others warned of World War III.Shadow foreign secretary Priti Patel said India had the right to take “reasonable and proportionate steps to defend itself and dismantle vile terrorist infrastructure”. “We know that terrorists based in Pakistan threaten India and Western interests,” she said.MP Bob Blackman said: “India made it clear that either Pakistan removes terrorist bases along the LoC or India would remove them. Nine sites were hit. These were terrorist bases where training took place and terrorists were trained to commit further atrocities in India.”However MPs Naz Shah, Yasmin Qureshi and Ayoub Khan claimed there was no evidence to prove Pakistan was behind the Pahalgam terror attack. Others such as Paul Waugh and Andrew Murrison criticised India for using water “as a weapon of war”.",UK government has called on Pakistan to do more to tackle the terror threat within its own borders.

Working for GRU:

Like a 'spy novel':





Six Bulgarians, members of a sophisticated spy network dubbed ""The Minions"", were before court Wednesday for sentencing, facing up to 14 years in prison for spying for Russia The four men and two women either pled guilty or had been convicted of charges of conspiracy to spy at Russia's behest with their sentences due to be handed down on Monday, after four days of hearings at London's Old Bailey court.Between 2020 to 2023, the six-person cell targeted journalists and a Kazakh former politician, and plotted to kidnap and honeytrap targets, tracking them across several European nations.It was "" industrial-scale espionage on behalf of Russia"", Metropolitan police counter-terrorism Chief Commander Dominic Murphy said in March.Ringleader Orlin Roussev, 47, along with his second-in-command Bizer Dzhambazov, 43, and Ivan Stoyanov, 32, pled guilty to spying.Barrister for the prosecution, Alison Morgan, on Wednesday laid out their roles in different operations, stressing they knew they were spying for Moscow.London-based Katrin Ivanova, 33, Vanya Gaberova, 30, and Tihomir Ivanchev, 39, were convicted in March after a trial lasting more than three months at the Old Bailey court.Two of the group were in court on Wednesday, with the rest appearing by video link from their detention centres.They had dubbed themselves ""The Minions"" after the cartoon yellow characters in the film ""Despicable Me"" who work for the dastardly Gru. The six also worked for the GRU, the acronym for the Russian military intelligence service.The group launched operations in the UK as well as Austria, Spain, Germany and Montenegro.But UK police were able to retrace six operations thanks to more than 100,000 messages found on Roussev's Telegram account, which led police to his seaside home in the eastern town of Great Yarmouth.Roussev received his instructions from Jan Marsalek, an Austrian fugitive who reportedly fled to Russia in 2020 after becoming wanted for fraud in Germany.Marsalek, the former chief operating officer of payments firm Wirecard, was acting as a proxy for Russian intelligence services.One operation targeted investigative journalist Christo Grozev, from the Bellingcat website, who uncovered Russian links to the 2018 Novichok chemical weapon attack in the English town of Salisbury and the downing of a Malaysia Airlines aeroplane four years earlier.The group had planned ""disruptive activity"" at the Kazakh embassy in 2022, discussing a plan to spray the building with fake pig's blood.Roussev received more than 200,000 euros ($227,000) to fund his activities.After the gang was busted in February 2023, police found huge amounts of spyware equipment in his home, including cameras and microphones hidden in ties, a stone, even a cuddly toy and a fizzy drinks bottle.In messages to Marsalek, Roussev claimed ""he will find the resources"" to ""keep the Russians happy"" such as by kidnapping someone, Morgan said.""The defendants were deployed to gather information about prominent individuals whose activities were of obvious interest to the Russian state,"" she added.Murphy said in March that police had found ""really sophisticated devices -- the sort of thing you would really expect to see in a spy novel"".Journalist and UK-based dissident Roman Dobrokhotov, and former Kazakh politician Bergey Ryskaliev, granted refugee status in Britain, were also among their targets.The group also kept the US military base Patch Barracks in Stuttgart, Germany, under surveillance, believing Ukrainian soldiers were being trained there in using the Patriot air defence system.Ties between Britain and Russia have been strained since Moscow's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine.British security minister Dan Jarvis warned the convictions should ""send a clear warning to those who wish to do the UK harm"".","Six Bulgarians, members of a sophisticated spy network dubbed ""The Minions"", facing up to 14 years in prison for spying for Russia.

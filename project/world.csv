In Dublin, another incident of assault involving a person of Indian origin has emerged, where the victim was struck twice on the head with a bottle and left bleeding, local media reported.A cab driver, who has lived in Ireland for more than 23 years and a taxi driver for more than a decade, sustained head injuries from a bottle strike twice in Poppintree, Ballymun on Friday evening. Following the violent incident, which left his vehicle blood-stained, he received treatment at Beaumont Hospital.Lakhvir Singh said he is ""very scared"" to resume work after sustaining injuries in an assault.The India-born father-of-two told Dublin Live that the assailants shouted xenophobic remarks ""go back to your own country"""" while fleeing. Lakhvir recounted collecting two young men, approximately 20-21 years old, from the northside before transporting them to Poppintree.Upon reaching their destination, the passengers forcefully opened Lakhvir's door and struck his head twice with a bottle. Despite attempting to seek assistance from nearby residences, no help arrived. He subsequently contacted emergency services, with both gardai and medical personnel responding to the scene.Although avoiding serious injury, he expressed significant concerns about returning to work. ""In 10 years I've never seen anything like this happen,"" he stated.""I'm really scared now and I'm off the road at the moment. It will be very hard to go back. My children are really scared.""A Garda representative confirmed their ongoing investigation, stating: ""Gardaí are investigating an assault reported to have occurred in Poppintree, Ballymun, Dublin 11 at approximately 11:45pm on Friday, 1st August 2025. A man, aged in his 40s, was brought to Beaumont Hospital for treatment of non-life-threatening injury. Investigations are ongoing.""This incident follows several recent attacks on Indian nationals in Dublin. On July 19, an Indian man experienced severe trauma after being assaulted, stripped, and facially stabbed by youths in Kilnamanagh, Tallaght during daylight hours.On July 27, a 32-year-old Indian data scientist required hospitalisation following an unprovoked assault by six teenage boys in Liffey Valley. These incidents prompted the Indian Embassy to issue safety advisories to their citizens in Ireland.The embassy advised Indian citizens in Ireland to take precautions for their personal safety and avoid deserted areas, especially at odd hours, after two more Indian nationals have been brutally attacked and left with serious injuries.The Indian embassy notice said there has been “an increase in the instances of physical attacks reported against Indian citizens in Ireland recently” and that the embassy was “in touch with the authorities concerned”. It advised Indian nationals to take ""reasonable precautions”.","Lakhvir Singh said he is ""very scared"" to resume work after sustaining injuries in an assault.

New space race: Acting Nasa chief Duffy to announce plan for building nuclear reactor on moon this week- Here's what we know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/new-space-race-acting-nasa-chief-duffy-to-announce-plan-for-building-nuclear-reactor-on-moon-this-week-heres-what-we-know/articleshow/123107077.cms,"



US transportation secretary Sean Duffy is set to reveal accelerated plans for constructing a lunar nuclear reactor this week, marking his first significant initiative as Nasa 's interim administrator.According to documents reviewed by POLITICO, this announcement will establish a clearer timeline for the lunar reactor project, despite Nasa facing substantial budget reductions. This initiative demonstrates Duffy's intention to influence Nasa's policy direction, even as he faced criticism for managing dual roles.""It is about winning the second space race,"" said a Nasa senior official, granted anonymity to discuss the documents ahead of their wider release.Following a disagreement with Tesla CEO Elon Musk in July, President Donald Trump appointed Duffy after withdrawing billionaire Jared Isaacman's nomination.Duffy has also issued instructions to expedite the International Space Station's replacement. These decisions could enhance American progress towards lunar and Martian missions, objectives that China is also pursuing.These initiatives reflect the Trump administration's emphasis on human spaceflight.The White House's 2026 budget proposal increases funding for crewed missions whilst significantly reducing other programmes, including a nearly 50 per cent reduction in science mission funding.The reactor initiative requires Nasa to request industry proposals for a 100 kilowatt nuclear reactor, targeting a 2030 launch date, crucial for lunar astronaut missions. Previously, Nasa funded research for a 40 kilowatt lunar reactor, planning deployment in the early 2030s.The directive warns that the first nation to establish a reactor could ""declare a keep-out zone which would significantly inhibit the United States,"" reflecting concerns about a China-Russia collaborative project.Nasa must appoint a project leader and gather industry feedback within 60 days. The 2030 launch target aligns with China's planned first lunar landing.Nasa maintains involvement in nuclear development despite the Pentagon's recent termination of a joint nuclear-powered rocket engine programme.""While the budget did not prioritise nuclear propulsion, that wasn't because nuclear propulsion is seen as a non-worthy technology,"" the Nasa official stated.The space station directive seeks to replace the current International Space Station with commercial alternatives through revised contract procedures.Nasa intends to award contracts to at least two companies within six months of the proposal request. The goal is to establish a new station by 2030, preventing China from being the sole operator of a crewed orbital station.Several companies, including Axiom Space, Vast, and Blue Origin, have shown interest. However, legislators have expressed worry about insufficient funding allocation speed.","US transportation secretary Sean Duffy is set to reveal accelerated plans for constructing a lunar nuclear reactor this week.

Russia earthquake: Powerful July quake appears to damage Russian nuclear submarine base- Here's what report said,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/russia-earthquake-powerful-july-quake-appears-to-damage-russian-nuclear-submarine-base-heres-what-report-said/articleshow/123106712.cms,"



A powerful earthquake with a magnitude of 8.8 that struck Russia’s Far East last month seems to have damaged the Russian nuclear submarine base, according to the New York Times, citing satellite imagery'Planet Labs,' a commercial satellite imaging firm, from Sunday showed damage to a floating pier at the Rybachiy submarine base, a crucial Pacific Fleet installation on the Kamchatka peninsula. One pier section had become disconnected from its moorings.The facility appeared largely intact, with five submarines and other vessels safely moored nearby. Neither Russian officials nor media have addressed the damage, whilst international nuclear monitoring organisations report normal radiation levels in the vicinity.The base has undergone recent upgrades, with two new floating piers installed since Russia's 2022 Ukraine invasion, according to military sources.Constructed during the Soviet era, the base's location in a sheltered cove provides natural protection from severe maritime conditions.Whilst most piers remain functional, tsunami waves from the earthquake affected one structure.The Conflict Intelligence Team told ""The New York Times"" that ""This is unlikely to affect the battle readiness of the base -- and repairs for the pier are probably not going to be costly.""On July 30, an 8.8 magnitude earthquake struck the region, generating substantial tsunami waves along the Pacific Coast and triggering worldwide alerts. The epicentre was approximately 80 miles from Rybachiy.The base shares its bay with Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy, which sustained minimal damage.Whilst tsunami waves were observed offshore, they did not reach the city centre.Both the submarine base and Rybachiy town maintain strict security protocols limiting public access.Following Ukrainian drone strikes on distant targets including an eastern Siberian airfield, Russia relocated certain military assets eastward this summer.The Kamchatka region experienced multiple seismic events last week, including a significant earthquake, subsequent aftershocks and volcanic activity.","Satellite imagery shows damage to a floating pier at the Rybachiy submarine base, a crucial Pacific Fleet installation on the Kamchatka peninsula.

Recently, a video going viral, showing multiple individuals being violently assaulted in downtown Cincinnati, has prompted Vivek Ramaswamy to criticise the prevalent ""anti-law enforcement culture"" in American society.The former 2024 presidential candidate and Ohio Republican gubernatorial hopeful discussed with Fox News Digital exclusively on Monday evening before a Cincinnati town hall focused on violence prevention. He stated that the Cincinnati incident has ""catalyzed a conversation in our state and frankly across the country about this issue of violent crime in the cities of the United States of America.""He described the assault on Holly, a woman in the video who apparently tried to help another victim, as ""totally unconscionable.""The footage shows a group attacking two victims, including Holly, who suffered severe brain trauma. The incident occurred early July 26 at Fourth and Elm Streets, outside a popular nightclub.Ramaswamy mentioned his communication with Holly after initially contacting her about her condition following the assault. He noted that Holly informed him no local elected officials had reached out to her after the incident.The police have identified six victims in total. Six individuals face charges, with four already arrested. The authorities continue searching for two suspects. Police Chief Teresa Theetge reported that among approximately 100 witnesses or participants, only one person contacted law enforcement.The arrested suspects include Jermaine Matthews, 39, Dominique Kittle, 37, Montianez Merriweather, 34, and Dekyra Vernon, 24.Ramaswamy advocates for Americans to feel secure in their cities without fear of assault. He expressed concern about people becoming indifferent to violence and emphasised the importance of addressing these issues through open dialogue rather than avoiding them.He acknowledged criticism for highlighting the incident but maintained that open discussion is crucial for bringing people together and addressing such problems effectively.Sharing the video from the Town hall, Ramaswamy said, ""We heard from a mother at tonight’s town hall who lost two teenage sons who were shot & killed in Cincinnati. It’s unconscionable & it’s time to actually do something instead of talking about it.""","Vivek Ramaswamy criticises the prevalent ""anti-law enforcement culture"" in American society.

Russiagate 'hoax': Attorney General Pam Bondi orders grand jury probe of Obama officials- Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/russiagate-hoax-attorney-general-pam-bondi-orders-grand-jury-probe-of-obama-officials-report/articleshow/123105933.cms,"



United States attorney general Pam Bondi directed her staff on Monday to proceed with the criminal referral from director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard concerning the alleged Russia-Trump conspiracy, Fox News Digital reported adding that the department of Justice is initiating a grand jury investigation into this matter.According to a letter reviewed by Fox News Digital and information from a source close to the investigation, Bondi has authorised an unnamed federal prosecutor to begin legal proceedings. The prosecutor will present evidence to a grand jury, potentially leading to an indictment.while declining to comment specifically on the investigation, a DOJ spokesperson confirmed that Bondi is treating Gabbard's referral with utmost importance. The spokesperson indicated that Bondi identified significant reasons for concern and the necessity for further action.The DOJ acknowledged receiving Gabbard's criminal referral two weeks prior. The referral included documentation regarding the Intelligence Community's alleged suppression of evidence showing that Russian and criminal activities did not affect the 2016 presidential election through cyber-attacks.No charges have been filed at this point against any potential defendants.This development follows Gabbard's July declassification of intelligence, which provided fresh perspectives on the Obama administration's alleged assessment that Russia aimed to assist Trump in the 2016 election.According to Gabbard's press briefing, the Obama administration allegedly promoted an artificial narrative about Russian interference favouring Trump's victory. The declassified materials included records of Obama requesting his deputies to prepare a December 2016 intelligence assessment regarding Moscow's electoral influence methods.The assessment concluded that whilst Russian actions aimed to create distrust in democratic processes, they did not affect the election outcome. Gabbard has suggested that Obama and his national security officials established the foundation for allegations of Trump-Russia collusion.The scope and potential charges of the grand jury investigation remain uncertain, particularly given that statutes of limitations have expired for many activities from nearly ten years ago. Former Obama intelligence officials, including John Brennan, James Clapper and James Comey, have faced scrutiny regarding their alleged roles in developing intelligence that challenged Trump's 2016 victory.","US attorney general Pam Bondi directed her staff on Monday to proceed with the criminal referral from director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard.

"Canada wildfire: Thick smoke chokes Midwest, Northeast US; air alerts widen",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/canada-wildfire-thick-smoke-chokes-midwest-northeast-us-air-alerts-widen/articleshow/123084098.cms,"



Thick smoke from hundreds of Canadian wildfires drifted across the border, causing hazy conditions over parts of the Midwest and northeastern United States on Sunday.According to government records, Canada is experiencing its second-worst wildfire season, with nearly 4,000 fires documented this year, NPR reported.The cross-border smoke has impacted air quality across several US states. Wisconsin, Michigan, and Minnesota experienced concerning air quality levels this weekend. Air quality alerts were issued for parts of Illinois and Indiana.Authorities in New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine advised residents to reduce outdoor activities due to smoke pollution.Bob Oravec, National Weather Service Lead Forecaster, told NPR that current wind patterns are facilitating the movement of polluted air from Canada into the US.""Air is moving at all levels and a lot of times it'll move in the same direction through the whole depth of the atmosphere, so the smoke is rising into the winds and the winds just transport it downstream, like anything — like a leaf getting blown,"" Oravec explained.Minnesota's Pollution Control Agency extended its statewide air quality alert until noon on Monday, August 4th.According to Minnesota Public Radio, the state is experiencing its longest air quality alert since the agency began issuing alerts in 2008, expected to last seven days.Some areas of Minnesota saw improved conditions on Sunday. Earlier in the weekend, the agency predicted the air quality index (AQI) would reach the severe ""red"" level statewide, considered unhealthy for all residents.The Pollution Control Agency stated that even healthy individuals might experience symptoms including eye irritation, coughing, or breathing difficulties. They warned of more severe impacts for others.""Sensitive or more exposed individuals may experience more serious health effects, including worsening of existing heart or lung disease and respiratory and cardiovascular conditions, possibly leading to an asthma attack, heart attack, or stroke,"" according to the Pollution Control Agency statement.Wisconsin's Department of Natural Resources extended air quality alerts until noon on Monday, August 4th, primarily in southeastern counties. Michigan officials also extended alerts across all counties through Monday.The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre reported over 700 active fires across Canada on Sunday, predominantly in southern Manitoba, north of Minnesota. Over 500 fires remain uncontrolled, forcing thousands of Canadians to evacuate.Canada has faced wildfires throughout the year. Two individuals perished in a southeastern Manitoba wildfire in May. Similar smoke conditions affected the US in June.Oravec suggests poor air quality could persist in US regions.""It looks like that pattern maintains itself going forward through this week, so it doesn't really appear to be any big break. There may be a day or so where there's a temporary break to it, but overall it looks like there is potential for additional smoke to be transported southeastward into the United States,"" he said.On Sunday afternoon, IQAir ranked Detroit, Chicago, and Minneapolis among the US cities with the most polluted air.","Smoke from hundreds of Canadian wildfires drifted across the border, causing hazy conditions over parts of the Midwest and northeastern U.S. Wisconsin, Michigan, and Minnesota experienced concerning air quality levels this weekend.

""Euphoria"" star Sydney Sweeney is once again trending online, this time for her impressive skills at the shooting range.A short video of 27-year-old actress Sydney Sweeney showing off her handgun skills has gone viral, with social media users impressed by her sharp aim and quick shooting.In the clip, Sydney can be seen dressed casually with earmuffs on. She is seen confidently loading and firing a Glock.Her steady stance and tight shot groupings had many online saying she looked like a pro, not a first-timer. Netizens reacted quickly as the video of Sydney Sweeney at a shooting range circulated online.One user reposted the video and wrote, ""Sydney Sweeney has insane handgun skills.""While another user reposted saying, ""She doesn’t just have great jeans; she's also a total pro at the firing range, unloading 17 rounds in just 9 seconds,"" referring to her recent American Eagle campaign.The video’s buzz comes in the midst of online backlash over Sweeney’s American Eagle ad, which has been criticised for its messaging and portrayal.The ad, which features Sweeney in a classic Americana setting fixing a car and wearing denim. Then, she uses red paint to change the word “genes” to “jeans” and says in a voiceover: “Genes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality and even eye color.My jeans are blue.”The tagline read “Sydney Sweeney has great jeans” plays on the word “genes,” which many critics found problematic.Some accused the campaign of being overly sexualised and promoting outdated beauty standards, pointing to the focus on Sweeney’s blonde hair, blue eyes, and slim physique.Others went further, interpreting the wordplay as an unintended reference to eugenics, a theory historically used to promote racial superiority.Earlier on Friday, American Eagle in response issued a statement on Instagram saying the campaign “is and always was about the jeans. Her jeans. Her story. We'll continue to celebrate how everyone wears their AE jeans with confidence, their way.”The brand emphasised that their message celebrates confidence and individuality, saying, “Great jeans look good on everyone.”While critics debated the ad’s deeper implications, marketing experts noted that the attention, positive or negative has certainly kept both Sweeney and American Eagle in the spotlight.",A short video of Sydney Sweeney showing off her handgun skills has gone viral.

Watch: 20-foot-long whale killed after boat collision in New Jersey; passenger thrown overboard,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/watch-20-foot-long-whale-killed-after-boat-collision-in-new-jersey-passenger-thrown-overboard/articleshow/123087040.cms,"Image: X/@wakeupnj





A boat collided with a minke whale along the Barnegat Bay in Ocean County, New Jersey, on Saturday, fatally injuring the animal and throwing one passenger overboard.Video circulating on social media shows the vessel rocking sharply after the impact, moments before a passenger is thrown overboard. The 20-foot whale appeared to swim away briefly before succumbing to its injuries.Officials from the Marine Mammal Stranding Center (MMSC) said they were alerted by the New Jersey state police Marine Unit around 2.45 pm (local time) on Saturday after a whale was spotted in Barnegat Bay near the inlet.MMSC staff coordinated with the US Coast Guard, the NJSP Marine Unit, and Sea Tow, while a stranding coordinator was dispatched to the scene, reports CBS News.Authorities received a report from a boater less than an hour later that a vessel struck the whale, nearly causing it to capsize, and threw a passenger into the water. The individual who went overboard was believed to be unharmed, as per officials, reports CBS News.Sea Tow, which remained at the scene to monitor the whale, later confirmed that the animal had died.The whale was located resting at a “very shallow” sandbar just outside the channel by the MMSC stranding coordinator and New Jersey Fish and Wildlife Conservation officers.Officials said plans are in place to tow the whale to a nearby New Jersey state park for a necropsy. However, due to limited access to heavy equipment and tidal timing, the whale will remain in place until Monday morning, when conditions are expected to allow for removal with assistance from Sea Tow.The video of the incident, which is now gaining significant traction on social media, has garnered sympathy for the deceased whale.“Oh, that poor whale. I hate that this happened,” commented a user.“Oh my gosh, this is just heartbreaking! Poor whale, and that passenger must have been terrified. It's such a tragedy that these kinds of accidents keep happening. We really need to do more to protect our marine life and ensure everyone's safety out there. Maybe stricter regulations on boat speeds in whale areas would help? It's just so sad to see nature suffer like this,” said another user.“So sad for the whale. I wonder what distresssed it?” commented another.The MMSC has advised boaters to exercise caution in the area north of Double Creek Channel in Barnegat Bay and to maintain a minimum distance of 150 feet from the whale carcass for safety reasons.","A boat collided with a minke whale along the Barnegat Bay in Ocean County, New Jersey, on Saturday, fatally injuring the animal and throwing one passenger overboard.

Russiagate: Tulsi Gabbard says Russia believed Hillary Clinton's 2016 victory 'inevitable'; claims Obama admin orchestrated hoax,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/russiagate-tulsi-gabbard-says-russia-believed-hillary-clintons-2016-victory-inevitable-claims-obama-admin-orchestrated-hoax/articleshow/123084080.cms,"Tulsi Gabbard (PTI)





Director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has claimed that Russian officials privately anticipated a Hillary Clinton victory was “inevitable” in the 2016 US presidential election, based on her assessment of recently released documents by her office.Speaking on Miranda Devine’s “Pod Force One” podcast, Gabbard has said that Russia had a strategy of undermining public trust in the American political system while preparing for a Clinton-based White House, despite the prevailing narrative that Russia was in support of Donald Trump “It surprised me that all of these documents still existed, quite frankly,” she said on an episode that is scheduled to release on Wednesday, reports the New York Post. “As we’ve learned in later documents that we’ve reviewed throughout that campaign, Russia believed that Hillary Clinton would win the election.“They felt it was inevitable,” she added.Tulsi Gabbard’s office last month began releasing a series of internal documents detailing how officials navigated the investigation into Russian interference during the 2016 elections.Among the disclosures was a 2020 House Intelligence Committee report, which alleged that Russian operatives may have obtained intelligence suggesting Hillary Clinton was “placed on a daily regimen of ‘heavy tranquilizers’” and was “afraid of losing.”“If Russia aspired to help Trump get elected, which is what the manufactured January 2017 intelligence community assessment says with high confidence, according to Brennan and Clapper, then Putin would have released the most damaging information and emails to help President Trump,” she said, questioning why the alleged Russian intelligence was never made public if Moscow truly had a goal to uplift Trump’s campaign.“It was intentionally withheld and not released because they assumed that Hillary Clinton would win that election, and their plan,” Gabbard said, reports the New York Post.Much of the material released by Gabbard focuses on challenging the findings of a 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment (ICA), which asserted, among other conclusions, that “the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump.”Gabbard accused former President Obama of ordering the 2017 ICA of Russian interference in the 2016 election, highlighting the actions of his administration, outlined in the newly released documents.“Out of respect for the office of the presidency, our office does not normally dignify the constant nonsense and misinformation flowing out of this White House with a response. But these claims are outrageous enough to merit one,” a spokesperson for Obama said, slamming the revelations made by Gabbard.“These bizarre allegations are ridiculous and a weak attempt at distraction. Nothing in the document issued last week undercuts the widely accepted conclusion that Russia worked to influence the 2016 presidential election but did not successfully manipulate any votes,"" said the Spokesperson.","Director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has claimed that Russian officials privately anticipated a Hillary Clinton victory was “inevitable” in the 2016 US presidential election. “It surprised me that all of these documents still existed, quite frankly,” she said on an episode that is scheduled to release on Wednesday.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123084128,imgsize-958982,width-400,resizemode-4/123084128.jpg"

Facing limited diplomatic options to resolve the hostage crisis, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is advocating for a “military solution” to secure the release of the remaining hostages held by Hamas, an Israeli official was quoted as saying by ABC News on Sunday.Netanyahu has proposed expanding military operations in Gaza, aiming to use force to rescue approximately 20 hostages still believed to be alive since their capture during Hamas’s attack on October 7, 2023.The official said that there is an increasing understanding within the Israeli leadership that Hamas is not interested in making a deal for the officials, reports ABC News.""Therefore, prime minister Netanyahu is pushing to expand military operations to release the hostages through a military solution,"" said the official.Tens of thousands gathered in the coastal city of Tel Aviv on Saturday to demand that Netanyahu’s government secure the release of the remaining hostages.""They are on the absolute brink of death,"" said Ilay David, the brother of Evyatar David, whose video was released by Hamas showing him in what he described as digging his own grave. ""In the current unimaginable condition, they may have only days left to live.""""The prime minister expressed profound shock over the materials distributed by the terror organisations Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and told the families that the efforts to return all our hostages are ongoing, and will continue constantly and relentlessly,"" Netanyahu’s office stated late Saturday.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday called on the International Committee of the Red Cross to assist with the hostages held in Gaza, reports AFP.Hamas’s armed wing responded by agreeing to grant the agency access to the hostages, but only on the condition that ""humanitarian corridors"" for food and aid are opened “across all areas of the Gaza Strip.""For months, humanitarian groups and international agencies have warned that Gaza is experiencing ""critical"" hunger levels, with famine ""imminent"" in some areas of the Gaza Strip.Gaza’s health ministry has also reported an increasing number of deaths linked to malnutrition. Around 175 people, including 93 children, have died due to malnutrition, as per the ministry, reports ABC News.Israel has imposed strict limits on the flow of aid into the besieged Gaza Strip, while UN agencies, humanitarian organizations, and analysts report that much of the aid permitted is either looted or diverted amid chaotic conditions.Many Palestinians are forced to risk their lives to access whatever limited aid is distributed through controlled channels.","Netanyahu has proposed expanding military operations in Gaza, aiming to use force to rescue approximately 20 hostages still believed to be alive since their capture during Hamas’s attack on October 7, 2023.

GOP's House map overhaul: Texas governer Greg Abbott orders arrest of Democratic lawmakers who fled state; session remains halted,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/gops-house-map-overhaul-texas-governer-greg-abbott-orders-arrest-of-democratic-lawmakers-who-fled-state-session-remains-halted/articleshow/123104389.cms,"Texas Republican governor Greg Abbott (Image credits: AP)





Texas Republican governor Greg Abbott on Monday ordered state authorities to arrest dozens of Democratic lawmakers who fled to Illinois in an effort to block a Republican-led congressional redistricting vote, intensifying a political standoff that has brought the legislative session to a halt.“To ensure compliance, I ordered the Texas Department of Public Safety to locate, arrest, and return to the House chamber any member who has abandoned their duty to Texans,” Abbott said.“This order will remain in effect until all missing Democrat House members are accounted for and brought to the Texas Capitol,” he added as quoted by The New York Post.The walkout by 51 House Democrats prevented the Texas legislature from reaching the two-thirds quorum required for a vote, stalling a special legislative session called by Abbott. The session was aimed at advancing redistricting plans, providing disaster relief for recent Texas floods, and banning THC, the main psychoactive compound in marijuana.“Texas House Democrats abandoned their duty to Texans,” Abbott said in a statement.“By fleeing the state, Texas House Democrats are holding hostage critical legislation to aid flood victims and advance property tax relief. There are consequences for dereliction of duty.”The Texas house ofrepresentatives voted 85-6 on Monday to approve a motion calling for the Democrats to return. House Speaker Dustin Burrows then directed the chamber’s sergeant at arms “to send for all absentees … under warrant of arrest, if necessary.”Most of the absent lawmakers traveled to Illinois, where dozens joined Democratic Governor JB Pritzker on Sunday night at the DuPage County Democratic Party headquarters.Roughly half a dozen other Democrats joined New York Governor Kathy Hochul in Albany on Monday.“If that’s what’s called for, that’s what’s called for,” Hochul said of the decision to leave Austin. She went on to call Abbott “un-American” and accused him of “rigging” the next congressional election for the GOP, reported The New York Post.“To subvert the will of the people, they’re hellbent on rigging the system. Rigging the system is un-American. Congressional districts are never drawn mid-decade,” she argued.The redistricting proposal, supported by President Trump, could net Republicans up to five additional seats in the US house of representatives—potentially expanding the GOP’s narrow majority in the 2026 midterm elections.","Texas Republican governor Greg Abbott ordered state authorities to arrest dozens of Democratic lawmakers who fled to Illinois.

The justice department has convened a federal grand jury to investigate officials from former US President Barack Obama’s administration, who are accused of pushing a false scandal about President Donald Trump’s alleged ties to Russia during the 2016 election.The investigation could lead to criminal charges against several prominent figures from the Obama era, including former director of national intelligence James Clapper, former CIA director John Brennan, and former FBI director James Comey, according to The New York Post.The inquiry focuses on claims that these officials conspired to create and promote the Trump-Russia narrative in the early days of the FBI’s “Crossfire Hurricane” investigation.The Crossfire Hurricane probe began in July 2016, when the FBI launched an investigation into alleged connections between the Trump campaign and Russian operatives. That inquiry later led to the appointment of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, whose 2019 report acknowledged “links” between Trump associates and Russian individuals but found no evidence of a criminal conspiracy.However, subsequent scrutiny raised concerns about the FBI’s conduct, particularly the improper use of FISA warrants against Trump adviser Carter Page.In October 2020, then-attorney general Bill Barr appointed John Durham as special counsel to examine the origins of the probe.Recent reports have highlighted a newly uncovered annex containing intelligence that “predicted the FBI’s actions with alarming specificity,” adding weight to Republican claims that the bureau may have sought to influence the 2016 election in favor of Hillary Clinton.Trump and current director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard have both called for a federal investigation into the origins of the Russia probe. Trump has accused the former officials of carrying out a “treasonous and seditious conspiracy” aimed at undermining his first-term agenda.He also acknowledged that Obama is likely immune from prosecution following a 2024 Supreme Court ruling that shields presidents from criminal charges related to official acts.",The investigation could lead to criminal charges against several prominent figures from the Obama era.

NEW DELHI: Operators of Boeing 787-9 and B787-10 models will have to check their ram air turbine (RAT) forward fittings after the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) proposed this to “address the unsafe condition” following reports indicating the same “were possibly manufactured with an incorrect titanium alloy material”.The erstwhile Vistara has seven Boeing 787-9 aircraft in its fleet that are now flying for Air India.This condition, “if not addressed, could result in loss of backup hydraulic and/or electrical power as well as the RAT module departing (snapping off) from the airplane,” the FAA says.RAT is a device on an aircraft used to provide emergency backup power by deploying into the airstream when needed, like in case of dual engine failure.The RAT deployed on AI 171, which crashed in Ahmedabad seconds after take-off on June 12.The pre-merger Air India uses B787-8 variants of Dreamliners (one of which crashed in Ahmedabad) and may not be required to undergo this check.“We issued guidance to our B787-9 and B787-10 customers in Feb 2025 and fully support the FAA’s proposal to make that guidance mandatory.”“The in-service fleet can continue normal operations,” Boeing said in a statement to TOI on Monday.The FAA said: “The titanium material that was possibly used is a Grade 1 or 2 commercially pure unalloyed titanium, which has significantly reduced strength, fatigue and damage tolerance properties…““A RAT forward fitting that was possibly manufactured with the incorrect titanium alloy material could fail when the RAT is deployed.”“The FAA is issuing this ‘notice of proposed rule-making’ after determining that the unsafe condition described previously is likely to exist or develop on other products of the same type design,” it added.The check requires “a high frequency eddy current or handheld X-ray fluorescence spectrometer inspection of the RAT forward fitting to determine the titanium alloy material”.",Boeing 787-9 and B787-10 models will have to check their ram air turbine (RAT) forward fittings.

A California lawmaker is leading a bold push to ban companies from using personal data collected from phones, laptops, and other devices to secretly hike prices- an AI-driven tactic increasingly under fire from consumer advocates and lawmakers alike.Senator Aisha Wahab, a Democrat from Fremont, has introduced legislation that would prohibit businesses from using AI to adjust prices based on information stored on customers’ phones, laptops, or other hardware.The bill, which cleared the state senate in May, is now being considered in the Assembly. It is one of 30 AI-related measures introduced by the Legislature this year.Wahab cited findings from Consumer Watchdog showing that ride-hailing apps charged more to riders with low phone batteries. Another investigation by ProPublica found the test prep company Princeton Review offered more expensive SAT tutoring to users in ZIP codes with high Asian populations.“Our devices are being weaponised against us in order for large corporations to increase profits, and it has to stop,” Wahab said during an Assembly committee hearing in July.Ride-hailing companies like Uber and Lyft have denied unfair pricing practices. Business groups, including the California chamber of commerce, and some Republican legislators are pushing back on the bill.“This overregulation is impeding how we do business and how people want to do business,” said Assemblymember Diane Dixon, a Republican from Newport Beach. “I just believe that the market resolves these issues.”","Senator Aisha Wahab has introduced legislation that would prohibit businesses from using AI to adjust prices.

Maryland murders: Woman reindicted with killing of her two missing children; rearrested after decade,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/maryland-murders-woman-reindicted-with-killing-of-her-two-missing-children-rearrested-after-decade/articleshow/123102536.cms,"Representative image





Nearly 10 years after her two toddlers disappeared in 2014 and have since not been found, a Maryland mother with a history of severe mental illness has been charged with their murders and rearrested.Catherine Hoggle, 38, was indicted last month by a Montgomery County grand jury on two counts of first-degree murder. She was taken into custody on Friday, according to the Montgomery County State’s Attorney’s Office, reported AP.Hoggle is scheduled to appear in court Monday afternoon for a bail review hearing.Her children, Sarah and Jacob Hoggle, were 3 and 2 years old when they vanished in September 2014. Around the same time, Hoggle also went missing. The children's father, Troy Turner, reported all three missing. Days later, Hoggle was found walking in a nearby town but refused to tell police where the children were.She was initially arrested on misdemeanor charges of child neglect and abduction and sent to a state-run psychiatric facility for treatment. In 2017, she was indicted on murder charges. However, a judge later found her incompetent to stand trial and ordered her to continue court-mandated treatment.Under Maryland law, the state had five years to restore a defendant’s competency before charges must be dismissed. In 2022, a Montgomery County judge dropped the murder charges due to that legal deadline. Despite the dismissal, Hoggle remained involuntarily committed because she was considered a danger to herself or others.Montgomery county state’s attorney John McCarthy said at the time that if Hoggle was ever deemed no longer a threat and released, he was prepared to refile the murder charges.Her recent release from the psychiatric facility raised new questions about her mental health status. It remains unclear why she was released and whether she has been receiving treatment elsewhere, reported AP.Hoggle has a long-documented history of mental illness. Her attorney, David Felsen, has said she suffers from severe mental illness, including schizophrenia, and was treated with antipsychotic medications after her initial arrest.Turner, the children’s father, has acknowledged Hoggle’s condition, telling the Associated Press in 2014 that she had begun showing signs of psychosis and was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. However, he later claimed she was feigning incompetency.","Catherine Hoggle, 38, was indicted last month by a Montgomery County grand jury on two counts of first-degree murder.

Trump threatens more tariff saying India is reselling Russian oil,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-threatens-more-tariff-saying-india-is-reselling-russian-oil/articleshow/123101306.cms,"



WASHINGTON: Accusing New Delhi of not only buying massive amounts of Russian oil but also selling much of it in the open market for big profits, US President Donald Trump on Monday threatened to ""substantially"" raise tariffs on Indian exports to the US, casting a dark shadow on the Indian economy and US-India ties.Trump's blunt and open threat, which came on top of the 25 per cent tariffs and unquantified penalty he has already announced last week, did not specify if there would be more or higher tariffs (taxes) than he has already rolled out. But what seems certain is that he is angered by India's obduracy in not concluding a trade deal on his terms and its insistence on continuing to buy discounted Russian oil.In a message he posted on his ""Truth Social"" platform, Trump also accused India of not caring ""how many people in Ukraine are being killed by the Russian War Machine."" Trump surrogates have alleged that India and China are virtually bankrolling the war because they are among the world's top two oil importers, and revenue from hydrocarbons is what is funding the Russian military.The charge that New Delhi is re-selling Russian oil for profit appears to be a distortion, twisting India's large refining capacity that makes Russian oil suitable for export, including to Europe.Trump is also irked by India's stodgy repudiation of his repeated claim that he used the bait of trade to stop the India-Pakistan war, a claim he has made nearly 30 times in several fora.Unable to end the Russia-Ukraine war on ""Day One"" of his presidency as he had pledged, Trump is talking up his role in the India-Pak truce in a transparent bid for a Nobel Prize, including gratuitously canvassing for it with anyone who listens.The extraordinary threat by the US President, who has weaponized tariffs for a range of objectives from gouging trade deals from poor and vulnerable nations to trying to bring about regime change (like in Brazil) to dismantling groups like BRICS that he sees as a threat to the US and the primacy of its currency, is unprecedented in history.Combined with Trump's sudden love for Pakistan ostensibly for its glib backing for a Nobel Prize for his, it evokes among some commentators memories of Washington's infamous 1970's ""tilt"" during the Nixon administration, when the US tried to bully New Delhi during the Bangladesh Liberation War by sending the US Seventh Fleet to the Bay of Bengal with the nuclear powered USS Enterprise.While a much weaker India refused to be browbeaten by the Nixon-Kissinger threat at that time, New Delhi appears to be in as defiant a mood in the face of Trump's belligerence, risking what some experts have said could be a 2 per cent blow to its GDP growth (currently clocking around 6.5 per cent), but which some government surrogates say could be as low as 0.2 per cent.","US President Donald Trump on Monday threatened to ""substantially"" raise tariffs on Indian exports to the US.

'Trump in high heels': Rep Nancy Mace joins race for South Carolina governor; positions herself as President's strongest ally,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-in-high-heels-rep-nancy-mace-joins-race-for-south-carolina-governor-positions-herself-as-presidents-strongest-ally/articleshow/123100921.cms,"Republican Representative Nancy Mace of South Carolina





Republican Representative Nancy Mace of South Carolina officially launched her campaign for governor on Monday, entering a crowded GOP primary where candidates are vying for the coveted endorsement of US President Donald Trump.While her opponents tout their connections to Trump, Mace- who describes herself as “Trump in high heels”- says she’s the one best equipped to carry out his agenda in South Carolina, where he continues to hold strong support among Republican voters.Mace made her run official during a campaign event at The Citadel military college in Charleston, the same institution where she made history as the first woman to graduate. She plans to begin a statewide town hall tour this week, starting in Myrtle Beach.“I’m running for governor because South Carolina doesn’t need another empty suit and needs a governor who will fight for you and your values,” Mace said as quoted by Wate News.“South Carolina needs a governor who will drag the truth into sunlight and flip the tables if that’s what it takes.”In an interview with The Associated Press, Mace outlined her campaign priorities.She said her platform will focus on criminal justice reform, ending the state’s income tax, protecting women and children, expanding school choice and vocational education, and improving energy options.Official filing for South Carolina’s 2026 election doesn’t open until March, but the governor’s race is already drawing multiple Republican contenders.Attorney general Alan Wilson, Lt Gov Pamela Evette, and Rep Ralph Norman have all entered what will be the state’s first truly open governor’s race in 16 years.Saying she plans to seek his support, Mace said, “No one will work harder to get his attention and his endorsement. No one else in this race can say they’ve been there for the president like I have, as much as I have and worked as hard as I have to get the president his agenda delivered to him in the White House.”She pointed to her past efforts in defending Trump, including an interview that led to ABC News paying $15 million toward his presidential library to settle a defamation lawsuit. She also noted that she called Trump earlier this year to help persuade GOP holdouts to support Rep Mike Johnson as House speaker.Mace has had a complex relationship with Trump. Though she worked for his 2016 campaign, she later criticised him after the January 6 Capitol riot — prompting him to support a primary challenger against her in 2022. Mace ultimately won reelection and went on to receive Trump’s endorsement in her 2024 campaign.“I’m going to draw the line, and I’m going to hold it for South Carolina, and I’m going to put her people first,” Mace said as quoted by Wate News.Mace, 47, briefly served in the South Carolina House before flipping the state’s 1st congressional district in 2020. She also made history as the first Republican woman elected to Congress from South Carolina. Her father served as commandant of cadets at The Citadel during her time there.","Republican Representative Nancy Mace of South Carolina officially launched her campaign for governor on Monday.

'Tired of way men treat Republican women': Marjorie Taylor Greene says she’s losing faith in GOP; accuses party of abandoning key issues,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/tired-of-way-men-treat-republican-women-marjorie-taylor-greene-says-shes-losing-faith-in-gop-accuses-party-of-abandoning-key-issues/articleshow/123099623.cms,"Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene





Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a prominent far-right Republican and close ally of US President Donald Trump , publicly voiced frustration with her own party, saying it is drifting away from policies that support everyday Americans and mistreating women within its ranks.She said she feels increasingly disconnected from the Republican Party as she continues to clash with both party leadership and Trump on several issues.In a recent interview with The Daily Mail, the Georgia congresswoman shared her views. Greene had previously condemned Israel’s war in Gaza, calling it a “genocide,” opposed Trump’s executive order on artificial intelligence, and demanded the release of the Epstein Files.“I don't know if the Republican Party is leaving me, or if I'm kind of not relating to the Republican Party as much anymore,” Greene said, as quoted by The Independent. “I don't know which one it is.”Greene said the party is turning away from priorities that matter to regular Americans. She criticised the lack of action on cutting foreign aid, the diminished use of the department of government efficiency to reduce federal spending, and the lack of progress on inflation.“Like what happened to all those issues? You know that I don't know what the hell happened with the Republican Party. I really don't,” she said. “But I'll tell you one thing, the course that it's on, I don't want to have anything to do with it, and I just don't care anymore.”Greene has consistently opposed US military aid to Ukraine during the Russia–Ukraine conflict, a policy that remains in place. She has also criticised the administration’s involvement in the Iran–Israel conflict.She noted that since Elon Musk , described as the de facto head of DOGE, left the White House, the administration appears to have shifted focus. While DOGE staffers remain in place throughout the government, reports suggest they now have less authority.Greene also expressed concern that the Republican Party is pushing away younger voters by continuing to back unpopular policies. She added that conservative women may also feel alienated by the way they are treated within the party.“I think there's other women in our party that are really sick and tired of the way men treat Republican women,” Greene said.She cited the case of Representative Elise Stefanik of New York. Trump had nominated Stefanik for US ambassador to the UN, but later withdrew the nomination to preserve the Republican majority in the House. Former national security adviser Mike Waltz was nominated instead.Greene said Stefanik got “screwed” by Speaker Mike Johnson and others in the White House, though she made clear she did not blame the president.Despite her dissatisfaction, Greene did not say she plans to leave the Republican Party.","Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene is a prominent far-right Republican and close ally of US President Donald Trump.

Pakistanis Describe Strikes; ‘Worse Than Earthquake…’ | India Destroys Terror Camps | Op Sindoor





A 5.4-magnitude earthquake struck several parts of Pakistan early Saturday morning, causing panic among residents in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab and the capital Islamabad, as reported by ARY News.The National Seismic Monitoring Centre (NSMC) reported that the earthquake occurred at 2.04 am PST at a depth of 102 kilometers. Its epicentre was located in the Hindukush mountain region in Afghanistan.Tremors were also felt across various regions in Afghanistan and Tajikistan, the NSMC confirmed.In Pakistan, the tremors were reported in multiple districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, including Peshawar, Swat, Malakand, Nowshera, Charsadda, Karak, Dir, Mardan, Mohmand, Shangla, Hangu, Swabi, Haripur, and Abbottabad.Tremors were also felt in several parts of Punjab province including cities such as Lahore, Rawalpindi, Islamabad, Attock, Taxila, Murree, Sialkot, Gujranwala, Gujrat, Sheikhupura, Ferozwala and Muridke.Although the earthquake caused no reported loss of life or property, it led to widespread panic. Many residents rushed out of their homes in fear and began reciting verses from the holy Quran, according to ARY News.Pakistan is one of the most earthquake-prone countries in the world, as it lies at the intersection of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates. This collision zone makes the region highly vulnerable to frequent seismic activities.High-risk areas include Balochistan , Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan, which are located near major fault lines like the Main Central Thrust. Punjab, situated on the northwestern edge of the Indian plate, also remains susceptible. Sindh, though relatively less prone to earthquakes is also not free from risk due to its tectonic positioning.One of the most powerful earthquakes in the country's history was the 1945 Balochistan earthquake that measured 8.1 in magnitude.","A 5.4-magnitude earthquake struck several parts of Pakistan early Saturday morning.

ISLAMABAD:

‘Trump Angry As India Denies Nobel Push, Rejects' Mediation In Operation Sindoor Ceasefire | WATCH





In a symbolic assertion of strategic alignment, Pakistan’s military hosted on Friday a grand ceremony at General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi to mark the 98th anniversary of China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA), showcasing its deepening defence partnership with Beijing.The event came soon after a surprise 19% tariff on Pakistani imports announced by US President Donald Trump just days after Washington and Islamabad concluded new trade deals.While the tariff decision is believed to have been discussed between the two sides as part of broader trade negotiations, Trump’s typically blunt commentary on social media appeared aimed more at India than Pakistan. In recent days, Trump has taken jabs at New Delhi over its continued purchase of Russian oil and defence equipment, while casting Pakistan in a more favourable light.At GHQ, however, Pakistan’s military made its strategic loyalties unambiguous. Army Chief Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir hosted Chinese ambassador Jiang Zaidong and PLA defence attaché Maj Gen Wang Zhong at a ceremony that included military tributes, visuals of joint defence hardware, and strong political messaging. Munir described the Pakistan-China relationship as a “beacon of mutual trust and shared destiny” and referred to the PLA and Pakistan Army as “iron brothers”.The messaging was clear: Pakistan is reaffirming its long-standing alignment with China even as it navigates transactional ties with Washington and economic turbulence at home. With IMF conditionalities tightening and Western funding streams growing unpredictable, Islamabad continues to anchor itself in Beijing’s strategic orbit, particularly through projects under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).For China, the event was a diplomatic win. As Beijing faces intensifying rivalry with the US across the Indo-Pacific, its deepening influence over a nuclear-armed ally in South Asia reinforces its foothold in the region. The GHQ ceremony was a visual and political endorsement of China’s role as Islamabad’s primary defence and development partner.With Pakistan and China enhancing defence cooperation and projecting unity, New Delhi faces a more tightly aligned northern bloc just as it expands its own security ties with the US and with Indo-Pacific allies.Despite the potential economic fallout of the US tariffs, Rawalpindi appears undeterred. In an era of fluid alliances, Pakistan is betting on consistency with Beijing over the unpredictability of Western partners, a gamble that could reshape the regional balance in the years ahead.",Pakistan's military hosted a grand ceremony to mark the 98th anniversary of China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) The event came soon after a surprise 19% tariff on Pakistani imports announced by US President Donald Trump.

A Pakistani anti-terrorism court on Thursday sentenced more than 100 members of jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan 's party to prison terms on charges related to riots that targeted military sites in 2023, a court order said.Fifty-eight of the defendants, who included parliamentarians and senior officials, were sentenced to 10 years in prison and the rest were given sentences ranging from one to three years, the court said.The accused include Omar Ayub Khan and Shibli Faraz, the leaders of Khan's opposition Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party (PTI) in the lower and upper houses of parliament respectively, the court order seen by Reuters read.""The prosecution has proved its case against the accused without a shadow of doubt,"" it said in announcing the sentences.Khan, who has been in prison since 2023 facing charges of corruption, land fraud and disclosure of official secrets, is being tried separately on similar charges related to the riot.The government accuses him and other leaders of inciting the May 9, 2023, protests, during which demonstrators attacked military and government buildings, including the army headquarters in Rawalpindi.He denies wrongdoing and says all the cases are politically motivated as part of a military-backed crackdown to dismantle his party. The military denies it.Khan's arrest had prompted the countrywide violent protests.Thursday's ruling does not directly affect the incitement case against him in which prosecution is still presenting witnesses.The PTI party said it will challenge the verdict.The ruling is the third such mass conviction this month; Khan's party says they have included at least 14 of its parliamentarians.They will lose their seats in parliament under Pakistani laws, which will shred Khan's opposition party's strength.Another 77 were acquitted for lack of evidence in the latest verdict, which is linked to an attack on the office of an intelligence agency in eastern city of Faisalabad, the court said.The party plans new protests starting on August 5, the second anniversary of Khan's jailing, to demand his release.","Fifty-eight of the defendants, who included parliamentarians and senior officials, were sentenced to 10 years in prison.

ISLAMABAD: At least 293 people have died and over 600 have been injured across Pakistan since late June as glacial lake outbursts, cloudbursts, and relentless monsoon rains triggered catastrophic floods across the country, from the Himalayas to the southern plains.The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has warned of another severe monsoon spell starting July 29, raising fears of fresh flash floods and landslides, especially in northern regions like Swat, Chitral, Gilgit-Baltistan, and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.Torrential rains have wreaked havoc across the country, sweeping away entire families, burying homes under landslides, and cutting off remote valleys. A sudden cloudburst near Babusar Top and Naran stranded scores of tourists, prompting military-led rescue operations by air and road. Washed-away bridges and blocked highways have hampered relief efforts.The NDMA, provincial agencies, and army teams are on the ground, but operations remain slow and patchy, especially in the hard-to-reach northern areas. Helicopter sorties continue, though poor weather and visibility are disrupting missions.Experts blame successive govts for ignoring climate adaptation and disaster preparedness, despite warnings. “The pattern is repeating itself — glacial melts, erratic monsoons, unprepared institutions. It’s a deadly mix,” said a disaster risk analyst in Islamabad.The crisis echoes the devastating 2022 monsoon floods, which killed over 1,700, submerged a third of the country, and displaced over 30 million people, causing $30 billion in economic losses. Yet, activists say climate resilience remains absent from Pakistan’s national priorities.With more glaciers than any non-polar country, Pakistan faces an increasing frequency of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) due to rising temperatures. Add to that deforestation, poor drainage, and unregulated construction, and experts say even routine monsoons now turn deadly.As another deluge looms, govt has advised evacuations from high-risk zones and warned tourists to stay away from northern areas. But for many already stranded, the warnings have come too late.","At least 293 people have died and over 600 have been injured across Pakistan since late June.

Dawn





Three Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militants were killed in an encounter with Pakistani security forces in Karachi, officials confirmed on Monday.Among those killed was Zafran, who was identified as the mastermind of a November 2024 attack on two Chinese engineers in Pakistan's largest city. He carried a bounty of Rs 20 million.The operation was conducted late Sunday night in the Manghopir area by the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) and intelligence agencies, CTD official Raja Umer Khattab told. The TTP men opened fire when they saw security personnel approaching, triggering a firefight which lasted over an hour.Authorities recovered a suicide jacket, three grenades, a Kalashnikov rifle, two pistols, and a large quantity of ammunition from the site.On November 5 last year, a private security guard opened fire on two Chinese nationals at a textile mill in Karachi, injuring both before fleeing.Pakistan has witnessed a sharp increase in militant attacks—particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan—since the TTP ended its ceasefire with the federal government in late 2022.Founded in 2007, the TTP is an umbrella organisation of various extremist groups seeking to impose a strict version of Islamic law across Pakistan. It has claimed responsibility for numerous high-profile attacks, including the 2008 Marriott Hotel bombing in Islamabad, the 2009 assault on army headquarters, and multiple strikes on security installations.","Three Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militants were killed in an encounter with Pakistani security forces in Karachi.

Pakistan tribal council threatens highway block over girl’s murder,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-tribal-council-threatens-highway-block-over-girls-murder/articleshow/122939897.cms,"



ISLAMABAD: A tribal jirga (council of elders) in Pakistan’s Tank district has threatened to block a stretch of Indus Highway on July 29 after the killing of a nine-year-old girl sparked public outrage. Convened in Tank’s Gul Imam on Saturday, the jirga issued an 11-point charter of demands, warning of a full blockade if authorities fail to respond.Indus Highway (N-55) is a critical national artery that runs along the river, connecting Karachi in Pakistan’s south with Peshawar in the north and cutting through multiple provinces. The planned blockade at Pezu will impact trade routes, passenger transport, and military convoys.The protests gained momentum after a viral video showed residents confronting armed security personnel -- an extraordinary act in this militarised stretch of southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The footage amplified long-standing anger over arbitrary detentions, raids without warrants, and what locals call collective punishment disguised as counterterrorism.“Our decision to block the highway remains. If our demands are accepted, we’ll reconsider.If not, Pezu will be shut down on July 29,” jirga leader Abdul Qayum Kundi said.Police have registered a case in the girl’s death, but authorities have yet to disclose any findings. Locals allege misconduct or negligence by security forces—claims that remain unverified but widely believed within the community.In a bid to defuse tensions, local officials delivered three sheep and (Pak) Rs 2.5 million (around $9,000) to the girl’s family -- an act rooted in tribal custom, meant to symbolise remorse and reconciliation. But jirga members view it as a token gesture. “This is hush money in ceremonial form,” said one elder.The jirga’s demands include the release of detainees not proven to have militant ties, an end to forced house searches, and a halt to arrests of suspects’ relatives. They also call for the return of confiscated weapons and an end to detentions based on vague accusations of mukhbiri (spying).The jirga’s demands echo those of the banned Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement (PTM), which for years challenged Pakistan’s security policies in its tribal belt.","A tribal jirga in Pakistan’s Tank district has threatened to block a stretch of Indus Highway.

‘Reject Pakistani Rule’: BNM Accuses Pakistan of Genocide in Balochistan, Launches Armed Resistance

Poll Do you think that protests and appeals by families of the abducted individuals can lead to change? Yes, they can raise awareness. No, they are largely ineffective.





The crisis of enforced disappearances in Pakistan's Balochistan region and beyond has deepened this week, as a disturbing string of abductions emerges from Karachi, Noshki, and Kech, according to The Balochistan Post (TBP).Among the most alarming cases is that of Muslim Dad Baloch, a fourth-semester philosophy student at the University of Karachi.On Monday evening, he was reportedly abducted near the university's Maskan Gate. Eyewitnesses say he was taken by unidentified men in a vehicle while returning to his hostel with friends.Originally from Mashkay in Awaran district, Muslim Dad was a familiar face within the Baloch student community in Karachi. His sudden disappearance has sparked fear among his peers and left his family devastated.In Noshki, another troubling case unfolded earlier today when Hafeezullah, the son of Peer Mohammad and a resident of Qaziabad, was allegedly picked up from his home by Pakistani security forces. His family has raised alarm over his unknown whereabouts and is demanding his immediate release.TBP also reported two recent disappearances in Kech district.On July 23, 16-year-old shopkeeper Qambar Baloch was allegedly taken by men believed to belong to Military Intelligence and the ISI while he was in Jusak, Turbat. And on June 27, Imran Khan, a 26-year-old student of Balochi language and culture at the University of Turbat, was reportedly abducted by Frontier Corps and Military Intelligence personnel in Turbat city—in broad daylight.“These are not isolated cases. This is a pattern,” said a representative from Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP), a group that has long campaigned for the safe recovery of abducted individuals. Despite repeated appeals and protests, most cases remain unresolved, with no accountability or formal investigations.","Muslim Dad Baloch, a fourth-semester philosophy student at the University of Karachi, was reportedly abducted on Monday.

"Two years on, Imran Khan's sons step in as protest call rattles Islamabad",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/two-years-on-imran-khans-sons-step-in-as-protest-call-rattles-islamabad/articleshow/122911552.cms,"



ISLAMABAD: As jailed former PM Imran Khan completes two years in prison, his sons – Sulaiman and Qasim – have stepped into the political spotlight, launching an aggressive lobbying campaign in the United States to press for their father’s release just days before Khan’s call for a nationwide protest on Aug 5, which has put the state on edge.Khan, arrested on Aug 5, 2023, remains behind bars despite some convictions being overturned. He is currently serving time in three major cases that his party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), claims are part of a broader effort to keep him out of politics.He was convicted in the Toshakhana case, involving the illegal sale of state gifts received during his premiership. He was sentenced in the cipher case, accused of leaking classified diplomatic correspondence for political gain. And in the Al-Qadir Trust case, Khan and his wife were held liable for controversial land deals linked to a charitable trust.PTI has consistently maintained that the charges are politically motivated, aimed at “eliminating the most popular leader” in the country.Now, with most of PTI’s senior leadership jailed, exiled, or forced to resign, Khan’s sons have taken the international route. Based in the UK, the brothers have held meetings in Washington DC with US lawmakers, policy groups and human rights organisations, and are reportedly preparing to testify before congressional panels.Their message: Imran Khan is being held in solitary confinement in inhumane conditions, denied light, medical access, and family contact.The campaign has triggered speculation about whether the two sons might return to Pakistan, possibly to appear at the planned protest. While PTI has not confirmed this, party insiders say their presence could act as a powerful morale boost for the party’s dispersed support base.Meanwhile, the state has moved swiftly to neutralise any protest momentum. On July 22, an anti-terror court in Lahore sentenced eight senior PTI leaders, including Dr Yasmin Rashid, to 10 years in prison for their alleged role in the May 9 riots, when military installations were targeted after Khan’s initial arrest. Observers see the convictions as a tactical strike to undercut mobilisation ahead of the Aug 5 protest. The verdicts have raised concerns among legal experts about the selective use of terrorism laws against political opponents.From prison, Khan has issued a call for unity among PTI ranks, urging supporters to “shun differences” and prepare for what he called a decisive moment for Pakistan’s democracy. But the party remains fractured and leaderless, with ongoing rifts between loyalists and factions seen as open to negotiations with the establishment.At the heart of the political storm is the army chief, Field Marshal Asim Munir, who was controversially elevated to five-star rank in May. PTI blames him, along with PML-N and PPP leaders, for orchestrating what it calls a civil-military clampdown to sideline Khan and crush dissent.In a recent prison note, Khan mocked Munir as the “King of the Jungle”, accusing him of ruling the country through “fear, not law”.","Sulaiman and Qasim Khan have launched an aggressive lobbying campaign in the United States to press for their father’s release.

Protests mark Hasina’s exit anniversary: Student-led party rallies in Dhaka; calls for new constitution,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/protests-mark-hasinas-exit-anniversary-student-led-party-rallies-in-dhaka-calls-for-new-constitution/articleshow/123078902.cms,"Protesters on the streets of Dhaka (AP)





A newly formed political party led by students who played a key role in the anti-government protests that led to the ouster of former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina held a rally in the country's capital Dhaka on Sunday, pledging to build a new Bangladesh amid ongoing political uncertainty surrounding the next national election, reported news agency AP.The National Citizen Party, formed by the organisers of last year’s protests, gathered near the Shaheed Minar monument with around 1,000 supporters. Party leader Nahid Islam announced a 24-point agenda and called for the creation of a new constitution to replace the one adopted in 1972.“Exactly one year ago, at this Shaheed Minar (memorial), we vowed to free this country from the hands of dictatorship. By responding to that call, we together defeated the fascist rule and regained control of our country,” Islam said.“Let us all unite and transform this historic 24-point agenda into reality to build a new Bangladesh, a Bangladesh that fulfills the dreams of all citizens, as we move toward the formation of our second republic,” he added, as quoted by the agency.The party did not provide specific details on the proposed constitution but said its goal was to reflect the aspirations of a new generation of Bangladeshis.Separately, the student wing of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) also held a large rally in Dhaka.BNP acting chairman Tarique Rahman, who has been in exile in London since 2008, addressed the crowd virtually and urged supporters to mobilise young voters ahead of the upcoming polls, according to AP.Rahman said, “We must reclaim our democratic rights and engage the youth in shaping Bangladesh’s future.”The rallies took place two days before the interim government, led by Nobel peace prize laureate Muhammad Yunus is set to mark the first anniversary of Sheikh Hasina’s departure from power.Hasina fled to India on August 5, 2024, following weeks of mass protests and political unrest that resulted in hundreds of deaths and thousands of injuries. Yunus assumed office on August 8.The demonstrations come amid criticism of the interim government’s handling of law and order, with opposition parties accusing it of failing to contain mob violence and uphold human rights.With Hasina’s Awami League banned and the political future still unclear, the rallies highlighted the growing activity among both new and established political forces ahead of the next election.","National Citizen Party, formed by the organisers of last year’s protests, gathered near the Shaheed Minar monument with around 1,000 supporters.

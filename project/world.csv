J.D. Vance’s Daughter Goes Viral After Adorable Thanksgiving Moment With Troops





US vice president JD Vance told troops in Kentucky on Wednesday that he plans to deep-fry a turkey this Thanksgiving because “it doesn’t actually taste that good”.Saying that Thanksgiving was “probably my favourite American holiday” and the “most uniquely American” one, Vance asked the crowd if they liked Thanksgiving turkey.“How many times do you roast an 18-pound turkey randomly?” he asked. “Nobody does it because turkey doesn’t actually taste that good.”He said he had spoken to a soldier who planned to deep-fry her turkey and decided he would try the same at home this year.The vice president, however, said that “If you’ve got to deep-fry something to make it taste good, it probably isn’t that good. That’s a pretty good rule of thumb.”He then compared it with chicken, saying it “tastes good all the time,” fried or not.Vance's comment echoed last year’s viral moment from health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, who posted a video on X showing how he cooks his turkey “the MAHA way.” MAHA is an acronym for ""Make America Healthy Again,"" which is a movement and health plan promoted by Kennedy.On Thursday morning, Vance wrote on X, “Happy Thanksgiving, everyone! I'm grateful for all of you, for the people who keep us safe, for our incredible country, and most of all for the grace of God and my beautiful family! Don’t eat too much!”","US vice president JD Vance told troops in Kentucky on Wednesday that he plans to deep-fry a turkey this Thanksgiving because “it doesn’t actually taste that good” He compared it with chicken, saying it “tastes good all the time,” fried or not.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125628094,imgsize-208316,width-400,resizemode-4/jd-vance-with-soldiers-on-base.jpg"

Indian-American leader Nikki Haley’s son, Nalin, distanced himself from his Indian roots saying that he was not going to have any ""weird loyalty"" to a country he had never visited.“All I’ve ever known is America … I’m not gonna have any sort of weird loyalty to a country where I’ve never been,” the New York Post quoted him saying.Voicing his strong opinion against immigration into the US, he said that legal immigration made ""made no sense"", given a ""fragile economy"".“I don’t view it as responsible to have legal immigration at a time when our economy is fragile and companies aren’t hiring Americans, and AI is taking over a lot of jobs. It makes no sense to have foreign workers come here [while] we actually are not hiring our own kids,” he said.Born in 2001 to Nikki and Michael Haley, Nalin spent part of his childhood in New York while his mother was the US ambassador to the United Nations.He later pursued a political science degree at Villanova University in Philadelphia and was received into the Catholic Church in South Carolina on Palm Sunday in 2025.Haley has increasingly aligned himself with the hard-right “America First” faction. In the past, he has advocated for a total halt to both legal and illegal immigration, the elimination of H-1B visas, and limits on naturalized citizens — including dual nationals — serving in public office. He has also described dual citizenship as a “stupid idea.”","Indian-American leader Nikki Haley’s son, Nalin, distanced himself from his Indian roots saying that he was not going to have any ""weird loyalty"" to a country he had never visited.

Tucker Carlson, Nick Fuentes & Trump: Inside the Chain Reaction Splitting Republicans Wide Open





Conservative commentator Tucker Carlson challenged Piers Morgan to say a gay slur on camera while discussing free speech in the United Kingdom.During Wednesday’s episode of The Tucker Carlson Show, the topic arose after Carlson referenced a story from The Daily Mail about Elizabeth Kinney, a 34-year-old woman who was convicted of a hate crime for using the slur against her attacker in text messages. She was fined and sentenced to a 12-month community order.Arguing that “you’re allowed to be homophobic if you want in a free country,” Carlson asked Morgan directly: “Would you say the word on camera?”Morgan, who said he hadn’t heard the story before, replied, “No.”Carlson pressed: “Why? You don’t want to get arrested, do you?” He added provocatively, “Ohhh, because it’s so harmful to people? Is it like gay-bashing? What’s wrong with that?”Morgan said you don’t need to use derogatory language about the LGBTQ community to make a point about women’s rights.Carlson used the word several times saying, “I’m using it because you’re not allowed to because you’re …”“I am allowed to, I just choose not to,” Morgan replied.Carlson defended himself, saying he is not anti-gay and “never has been,” adding: “I can use any word I want. How about this? Let my life, the way that I actually live and treat people, be the testament to my heart. That’s how I feel. And if I’ve mistreated someone, that is a sin.”Morgan interrupted, suggesting Carlson wouldn’t use the word directly to a gay person’s face. Carlson responded: “Not in a mean way. Just like the only people who say the ‘N-word’ are Black. Period.”He added that during his time in TV news, he had been around many gay people who used the word themselves.Carlson, who was fired from Fox News in April 2023, has a history of controversial remarks and conspiracy theories.He previously claimed in his biography, Tucker, by Chadwick Moore, that “being racist is not a crime,” though he acknowledged it might be a moral crime.","Conservative commentator Tucker Carlson challenged Piers Morgan to say a gay slur on camera while discussing free speech in the United Kingdom.

Trump Warns Allies On Migration After Shocking Attack Near White House By Afghan Man





US president Donald Trump on Thursday blasted a reporter who asked why he blamed the Biden administration for Wednesday’s shooting near the White House.“Because they let him in. Are you stupid? Are you a stupid person?” Trump asked, adding, “Because they came in on a plane along with thousands of other people that shouldn’t be here. And you’re just asking questions because you’re a stupid person.”Trump criticised the vetting process during Biden, saying: “And there’s a law passed that it’s almost impossible not to get them out. You can’t get them out once they come in. And they came in and they were unvetted. They were unchecked. There were many of them. And they came in on big planes. And it was disgraceful.”Trump also spoke about the Afghanistan withdrawal: “And frankly, the whole thing was a mess. The whole Afghanistan situation was a mess. It should have never taken place if we’re going to go out. And we would have gone out because I had everybody ready to go. We were going to go out with strength and dignity and precision.Trump repeated his claim that the US should have kept Bagram, “because of its very close relationship to China and where they make their missiles. But when you let the people come in by the thousands and thousands and thousands, they made a terrible mistake.They were incompetent.”The suspect in Wednesday's shooting, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, 29, entered the US on 8 September 2021 under Operation Allies Welcome, a resettlement programme launched after the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. Lakanwal had previously worked with the CIA in Afghanistan.The shooting occurred Wednesday afternoon a few blocks from the White House, near 17th Street NW and I Street NW, close to the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, killing one National Guard member and leaving a second critically injured.","The suspect in Wednesday's shooting, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, 29, entered the US on 8 September 2021 under Operation Allies Welcome.

National Guard Shot: Shocking Eyewitness Account; ‘They Had Somebody Pinned Down' | Washington DC'

Troops subdued the shooter

Witnesses describe chaos

Trump vows consequences





NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump on Wednesday condemned the shooting at White House of two National Guard soldiers and said that the suspect from Afghanistan entered the country in 2021. Calling it 'an act of terror', he urged to reinvestigate all Afghan refugees that entered under the Biden admin after the National Guard shooting.In his address from Florida, Trump said, ""Earlier today on the eve of the thanksgiving holiday, two members of the National Guard serving in Washington DC were shot at point blank range in a monstrous, ambush styled attack just steps away from the White House. This heinous assault was an act of evil and an act of hatred and an act of terror. It was a crime against our entire nation, it was a crime against humanity. The hearts of all Americans tonight are with those two members of the West Virginian National Guards and their families. ""Trump said that as the country is filled with anguish and grief for those shot at, ""we're also filled with rightous anger and ferocious resolve"".He said that as the President of the United States, ""the animal who perpetrated this atrocity, pays the steepest possible price.I can report tonight based on the best available information, the Department of homeland security is confident that the suspect in custody is a foreigner who entered our country from Afghanistan- a hellhole on earth.""Trump alleged that the Afghan person was flown in by the Biden administration in 2021, ""on those infamous flights.... his status was extended under legislations signed by President Biden"" and added, ""this attack underscores the single greatest national security threat facing our nation. The last administration let in 20 million unknown foreigners from all over the world"".He said that US will now re-examine every single alien who has entered the US from Afghanistan under Biden administration and ensure removal of those who don't love America.""We are not going to put up on these kinds of assaults on law and order by people who shouldn't even be in our country. We must now re-examine every single alien who has entered our country from Afghanistan under Biden, and we must take all necessary measures to ensure the removal of any alien from any country who does not belong here or add benefit to our country. If they can't love our country, we don't want them. America will never bend or yield in the face of terror. At the same time, we will not be deterred from the mission the service members were so nobly fulfilling.""He announced that he has directed the Department of War to mobilise and additional 500 troops ""to help protect our capital city. We will make America totally safe again and we will bring the perpetrator of this barbaric attack to swift and certain justice if the bullets going in the opposite direction haven't already done that.""He said that the Guards were serving their duty to protect the nation, when they were ""gunned down in a savage attack"" and asked people to say a prayer this Thanksgiving for them.Two members of the West Virginia National Guard deployed to the nation’s capital were shot Wednesday afternoon just a few blocks from the White House, in what officials described as a bold and targeted attack. FBI director Kash Patel and Washington mayor Muriel Bowser said both service members were hospitalized in critical condition.The unusual shooting of National Guard personnel—on the eve of Thanksgiving—comes amid months of controversy over the presence of Guard troops in Washington and other US cities. Their deployment by the Trump administration has fueled legal battles and a broader debate over the use of military forces to address what officials have labeled a spiraling crime problem.A suspect, who was taken into custody, was also wounded in the confront ation. His injuries were not believed to be life-threatening, according to AP.Hours later, in a video message posted on social media, President Donald Trump called for a reinvestigation of all Afghan refugees admitted under the Biden administration.“If they can’t love our country, we don’t want them,” he said, calling the shooting “a crime against our entire nation.”DC police executive assistant chief Jeffrey Carroll said investigators have not determined a motive. Video reviewed by authorities showed the gunman “rounding the corner” and opening fire on the troops almost immediately. “This was a targeted shooting,” Bowser said.West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey initially announced the troops had died, but later amended his statement, saying his office was receiving “conflicting reports” about their condition.The Trump administration responded by ordering an additional 500 National Guard members to Washington. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said the president had directed him to send more troops. Nearly 2,200 Guard members are currently assigned to the city’s joint task force, according to the latest government update.The shooting occurred about two blocks northwest of the White House, near a metro station. Carroll said other Guard members nearby heard the gunshots, rushed to the scene, and restrained the gunman after he had been shot.“It appears to be a lone gunman who raised a firearm and ambushed these National Guard members,” Carroll said, adding that investigators have not yet determined whether the suspect was shot by a Guard member or a police officer.“At this point we have no other suspects,” he said.At least one Guard member exchanged gunfire with the attacker, according to another law enforcement official who was not authorized to speak publicly.Cellphone video shared on social media shortly after the attack showed first responders performing CPR on one Guard member and treating the other on a sidewalk littered with broken glass.Stacy Walters, who was sitting in her car nearby, said she heard two shots and saw people running before law enforcement rapidly descended on the scene. “It’s such a beautiful day. Who would do this? And right before the holidays?” she said.Emma McDonald, who had just exited a metro station when the shots were fired, said she and others sheltered inside a café. Minutes later, she saw first responders rush past, pushing a stretcher carrying a badly wounded Guard member.From Florida, where he is spending Thanksgiving, Trump called the gunman an “animal” who “will pay a very steep price.” “God bless our Great National Guard, and all of our Military and Law Enforcement. These are truly Great People,” he wrote on Truth Social.Speaking in Fort Campbell, Kentucky, vice president JD Vance asked people of faith to pray for the wounded. He noted that much remains unknown, including the motive.“It’s a somber reminder that our soldiers—active duty, reserve, or National Guard—are the sword and shield of the United States,” Vance told troops gathered for a Thanksgiving message.Gen. Steven Nordhaus, chief of the National Guard Bureau, canceled planned holiday visits to troops at Guantanamo Bay so he could travel to Washington to be with Guard members there.In August, Trump issued an emergency order federalizing the local police force and deploying Guard units from eight states and the District of Columbia. Although the order expired a month later, the troops stayed. Last week, a federal judge ordered the deployment to end, but paused her ruling for 21 days to allow time for an appeal or for the administration to withdraw the troops.Guard members have been patrolling neighborhoods, transit stations, and other areas; staffing highway checkpoints; and even assisting with trash collection and security at sporting events.","US President Donald Trump condemned the shooting at White House of two National Guard soldiers and said that the suspect from Afghanistan entered the country in 2021.

"Once MacKenzie Scott borrowed $1,000 from her friend to pay college fees, now the billionaire is returning the favour",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/once-mackenzie-scott-borrowed-1000-from-her-friend-to-pay-college-fees-now-the-billionaire-is-returning-the-favour/articleshow/125598151.cms,"MacKenzie Scott’s path from borrower to major philanthropist

A philanthropic approach shaped by access, equity and scale

A full circle story of kindness and opportunity





MacKenzie Scott, one of the world’s most influential philanthropists, has come full circle after once relying on a friend’s financial help to stay in college. As a Princeton undergraduate, Scott faced dropping out when she could not afford $1,000 in fees, until her roommate Jeannie Tarkenton secured the money for her. Decades later, Scott, now a billionaire, is backing Tarkenton’s student-lending startup in a gesture many see as a symbolic return of kindness.Scott has written that the experience of receiving help at a vulnerable moment influenced her views on generosity. Her former roommate recalls finding her in tears and arranging the $1,000 loan that allowed Scott to continue her studies at Princeton.With a net worth estimated at around 34 billion dollars, Scott has given away more than 19 billion dollars since her 2019 divorce from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos , in which she received a substantial shareholding. Rather than establishing a traditional foundation or maintaining a public philanthropy profile, she became known for issuing surprise, unrestricted grants to organisations serving disadvantaged communities, often without seeking attention or public credit.Tarkenton, the roommate who helped Scott stay enrolled, later founded Funding U, a for-profit lending company offering merit-based loans to low-income students who lack co-signers. Scott has become a key financial supporter of the venture, providing capital that reduces risk for banks and makes it possible for more students to secure funding. The company assesses applicants based on academic records, internship experience, and likelihood of completing a degree, a model supporters say better reflects the realities of first-generation and low-income students.Following her divorce, Scott launched a large-scale giving initiative that directed billions of dollars to organisations across the United States. Her donations have supported education, community development, women’s initiatives, food access, and poverty reduction. Among her most widely recognised contributions were major gifts to Historically Black Colleges and Universities, as well as tribal, Indigenous-serving, and community colleges that had rarely received major private donations in the past.Scott once relied on a small loan to stay in university, and she is now supporting a venture designed to ensure other students do not face the same barrier. The renewed connection between Scott and Tarkenton highlights how early experiences can shape long-term commitments to expanding opportunity and educational access. What began as a modest favour between friends has evolved into an initiative reaching students across the country, demonstrating how individual acts of support can grow into broader systems of opportunity.","As a Princeton undergraduate, Scott faced dropping out when she could not afford $1,000 in fees.

The death toll in the massive fire in multiple high rises in Hong Kong rose to 44, with over 270 hundred still missing. Later, several media outlets reported arrest of 3 people in connection to the fire.Chinese President Xi Jinping expressed condolences and urged the city to contain the disaster swiftly.State media reported that Xi called on authorities to “make every effort” to put out the fire and minimise further loss of life.“Xi Jinping expressed condolences for those who died in the major fire at a residential estate in Tai Po District, New Territories, Hong Kong, including the firefighter who died in the line of duty,” it said.The death toll in the incident was revised to 44, after initial count of 36, while 279 are reported missing.Police have arrested three men on suspicion of manslaughter in connection with the blaze, as reported by South China Morning Post. Police announced the arrests in a brief, one-sentence advisory that did not detail the suspects’ alleged actions, and said more information would be provided at a later press conference.Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee confirmed the rising toll and said that search teams were still tracing missing residents as smoke continued to billow from the charred towers.The Fire Services Department said it received the first emergency call at 2:51 pm local time and escalated the blaze to a No 4 alarm at 3:34 pm, one level below the highest emergency classification. Dozens of engines, ambulances and rescue teams were deployed as smoke poured from the towers, which house around 2,000 apartments and were undergoing renovation work.“Police and the Fire Services Department have already set up a dedicated investigation team to investigate the cause of the fire,” said John Lee, Hong Kong's chief executive, as quoted by AP.Witnesses described seeing residents gathered on overhead walkways as flames climbed rapidly up buildings covered in bamboo scaffolding. The Tai Po district, home to nearly 300,000 people, is among Hong Kong’s most tightly packed urban zones.Roads around the area remain closed, with bus routes diverted as firefighters continue sweeping each floor to locate survivors. More details are awaited as authorities verify the number of missing residents and assess structural safety before entering deeper sections of the complex.The blaze tore through the Wang Fuk Court housing complex in Tai Po on Wednesday, with flames and thick smoke engulfing the 32-storey blocks for more than ten hours.Fire Services Director Andy Yeung Yan-kin said officers found styrofoam inside the burning buildings, which he believes intensified the blaze. According to the South China Morning Post, the material allowed flames to race through corridors and ignite flats across multiple levels. Yeung noted that firefighters could only enter from the ground floor as many floors were still burning well into the early hours of Thursday. One of the biggest challenges, he said, was the number of levels alight simultaneously.Security Secretary Chris Tang called the fire’s speed “suspicious”. Preliminary checks, he said, showed that the building’s netting and waterproof tarpaulin burned far faster than regulated materials. “We found that the netting and waterproof tarpaulin on the building walls, once ignited, spread flames much faster than they should. This is unusual,” Tang said. He confirmed that police and fire officers would conduct a full investigation, including a criminal probe into any irregularities.Read more: What caused the Hong Kong fire that killed 36 and left hundreds missing","Chinese President Xi Jinping expressed condolences and urged the city to contain the disaster swiftly.

The Trump administration has ordered a sweeping review of all green cards issued to people from 19 countries it classifies as “of concern”, escalating its immigration clampdown following the shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, DC.Joseph Edlow, director of United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, said he acted on President Donald Trump’s direction and had instructed a “full scale, rigorous reexamination of every Green Card for every alien from every country of concern”. His announcement came hours after the attack, which the president has already cited as justification for tightening entry rules.Officials said that the list of 19 countries matches those named in a June presidential proclamation, which imposed full or partial suspensions on the entry of nationals from:When pressed for details, USCIS pointed to that proclamation, which cited high visa overstay rates, lack of cooperation on removals, weak vetting systems and security concerns, including terrorism threats.The move follows the brazen attack on Wednesday in which two West Virginia National Guard members — Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, 20, and Staff Sgt Andrew Wolfe, 24 — were critically injured. Both had been deployed to the capital as part of Trump’s crime-fighting mission, which placed nearly 2,200 Guard troops under federal control. West Virginia’s governor, Patrick Morrisey, initially announced that the pair had died before later amending his statement, saying his office had received “conflicting reports”.Authorities identified the suspect as 29-year-old Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an Afghan national who drove across the country to launch what prosecutors described as an “ambush-style” attack using a .357 Smith & Wesson revolver. Video reviewed by investigators showed him turning a corner and opening fire immediately. Troops returned fire, subdued him and handed him over to police. His injuries were not believed to be life-threatening, and investigators have yet to identify a motive.Lakanwal arrived in the United States in 2021 through Operation Allies Welcome, the Biden-era programme established after the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan. He applied for asylum during the Biden administration but, according to #AfghanEvac, his case was approved under Trump. Officials say he had passed all background checks, including those conducted before his work with the U.S. government in Afghanistan, where he had links to CIA-backed Zero Units. Those units were known for frontline operations and heavy involvement in the final days of the U.S. withdrawal.Lakanwal faces charges including assault with intent to kill while armed. U.S. attorney Jeanine Pirro said charges could be upgraded: “We are praying that they survive and that the highest charge will not have to be murder in the first degree.”Trump has ordered an additional 500 National Guard troops into Washington. A federal judge has already ordered the wider deployment to end but has paused her ruling for 21 days to allow the administration time to appeal or withdraw the forces.","The move follows the brazen attack on Wednesday in which two West Virginia National Guard members — Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, 20, and Staff Sgt Andrew Wolfe, 24 — were critically injured.

New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani opened up about his transition, political pressures and even his Bollywood music knowledge, at one point dropping into the iconic Shah Rukh Khan pose, in an exclusive conversation with British journalist Mehdi Hasan.The interview was recorded inside his campaign headquarters that he will soon vacate and marks Mamdani’s first major sit-down since his election victory earlier this month against independent candidate Andrew Cuomo.The Zeteo interview also featured a fun Bollywood guessing game. Hasan quizzed him on Indian classics like Chaiyya Chaiyya, featuring Shah Rukh Khan.

He also shed light on growing normalisation of Islamophobia and said he is seriously worried about the security of his phone number.Speaking about national politics, Mamdani threw an interesting and contrasting point of the two major parties. He said that Republicans tend to approach politics with an imagination that keeps expanding, pointing to ideas as absurd as buying Greenland. Democrats, he argued, often seem trapped in a mindset where the sense of what is possible keeps shrinking. He said, “Republicans, they have a sense of imagination that is ever-expanding.

How asylum is granted in the US





FBI director Kash Patel sidestepped a crucial question on how DC shooting suspect Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an immigrant from Afghanistan who came to the US in 2021, was granted asylum by the Donald Trump administration in 2025. When Patel was asked whether the authorities missed any signs while granting asylum, Patel did not address the heart of the controversy that though Lakanwal was allowed to enter the US by the Biden administration but was granted asylum by the Trump administration. But he tactfully passed the buck on the previous administration.“Well, you miss all the signs when you do absolutely zero vetting - and that's exactly what happened in this case,"" Patel said.“When the prior administration made the decision to allow thousands of people in without doing a single piece of background checking in your vetting, that's how you miss every single sign,"" the FBI director said.People who can prove to the administration that they are being persecuted in their country can get asylum in the US within a year of arriving in the US. For individual cases, there is a strong vetting process in place but Lakanwal came to the US not as an individual but along with many who were welcomed to the US in 2021 under Joe Biden's Operation Allies Welcome.This happened after the US military withdrew forces from Afghanistan and the government collapsed, giving in to the Taliban power.Over 70,000 Afghan nationals were allowed into the US under the program which was vetted by US counter-terrorism and intelligence agencies. But Republican leaders claimed that there was no background check as the evacuation was rushed.Under the Operation Allies Welcome program, Afghans evacuated to the US were granted a two-year ""parole"" that allowed them to live and work legally and then apply for a more permanent status. Lakanwal applied for asylum in December 2024 and was granted asylum in April this year. He had no known crminal historty and the government file of Lakanwal said he had been vetted by the US because of his work with US government partners during the war in Afghnistan.","DC shooting suspect Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an immigrant from Afghanistan, came to the US in 2021.

America's workforce ageing, can't fill skill gap





CEO of Texas's International Bank of Commerce Dennis Nixon spoke out in favor of the H-1B visa amid the raging controversy and said the fee of $100,000 won't impact the biggest sponsors like Amazon, Microsoft, Meta or Apple. But entrepreneurs will struggle to hire workers as foreign talent will be pushed only to bigger corporations, as they will only have the ability to afford H-1Bs. Calling the new H-1B visa fee a 'prohibitive fee', Nixon said that more than 45% of Fortune 500 companies were founded by immigrants or their children, including Nvidia, SpaceX, Alphabet, and all of them started as small ventures.In an opinion piece in San Antonio Express News, Nixon said that it is a misconception that H-1Bs displace native American workers. Before an employer can file for an H-1B visa, they have to ensure that hiring an H-1B worker will not displace a native worker. While complaints of a massive abuse in the system are rampant, the CEO said that immigrant workers have different skill sets, filling the types of jobs that complement American workers in the labor market rather thn competing for the same positiions.""Immigrants are also consumers who live and work in the United States.They contribute directly to the nation’s gross domestic product by investing their earnings back into the economy, driving growth and creating new jobs.

These highly skilled workers must fill specialized positions that complement — not replace — American workers in top industries, including finance and technology,"" the CEO added.According to Nixon, America's ageing workforce cannot fill the existing skill gaps. ""Every day, nearly 11,400 American workers retire while only 7,212 enter the workforce. As skilled foreign workers leave the American talent pool, it is increasingly difficult to find qualified employees,"" he wrote.H-1B has emerged as the most contentious issue of the Donald Trump administration as the administration imposed an exorbitant fee so that companies can't hire H-1Bs but at the same time, President Donald Trump maintained that America needs H-1Bs for certain skills.","CEO of Texas's International Bank of Commerce Dennis Nixon spoke out in favor of the H-1B visa amid the raging controversy.

'WON'T TOLERATE': Ramaphosa Launches Brutal Attack On Trump; South Africa Tears Into US Over G20 Ban





: Bluntly accusing the South African government of genocide of white people, US President Donald Trump said he would bar the country from attending the G-20 summit in Miami late next year, throwing the world's main forum for international economic cooperation, of which India is a part, into turmoil.In an angry social media post, the US President, who boycotted the just concluded G-20 meet in Johannesburg, said he did not attend because the South African Government ""refuses to acknowledge or address the horrific Human Right Abuses endured by Afrikaners, and other descendants of Dutch, French, and German settlers.”“To put it more bluntly, they are killing white people, and randomly allowing their farms to be taken from them,” he alleged. The narrative, mostly from a small minority of white nationalists in South Africa and US., has been widely debunked by independent observers amid acknowledgment that the country faces a law-and-order situation.The US President further maintained that South Africa “has demonstrated to the World they are not a country worthy of Membership anywhere,” and said he will “stop all payments and subsidies to them, effective immediately.”U.S aid to Pretoria, mostly in the health sector, peaked at $ 564 million in 2024 before tailing off to a planned $ 103 million in 2025 amid deteriorating ties underscored by an Oval Office ambush of South Africa’s President Cyril Ramaphosa where Trump showed him a multimedia presentation of ""white genocide.” Ramaphosa maintained that the farm attacks were part of broader crime affecting all races and the allegations Trump referenced was from a ""small minority party"" not reflective of government policy.Ramaphosa’s narrative was backed by golfing greats Ernie Els and Retief Goosen (brought in to appeal to Trump's love of golf) and billionaire Johann Rupert (South Africa’s richest man) even as Trump surrogate Elon Musk, who has promoted the white genocide allegations, glowered over them. “I am sorry I don’t have a plane to give you,” Ramaphosa joked at one point during the meeting, referring to a story at that time about Trump receiving a jet from Qatar. “I wish you did,” the U.S President kidded back.But beyond the banter ties continued to sour, with Trump taking exception to what he claimed was South Africa’s refusal to hand off the G20 Presidency to a Senior Representative from the U.S. Embassy, who attended the closing ceremony in Johannesburg. Ramaphosa rejected the charges saying the “instruments of the G20 Presidency were duly handed over to a US Embassy official,” amid doubts over whether the Miami event will take place at all given the growing fissures in global politics and the adversarial position the U.S has taken on several fronts.In a blistering rebuttal to Trump’s effort to evict South Africa from the G-20, Ramaphosa said the country is a member of the group “on its own name and right” and called on other member nations to reaffirm its continued operation in the spirit of multilateralism, based on consensus, with all members participating on an equal footing in all of its structure. “South Africa… does not appreciate insults from another country about its membership and worth in participating in global platforms,” he lashed back.Legal and institutional norms surrounding the G20 cast serious doubt on the possibility and legitimacy of a unilateral ban on South Africa by Trump. The G20 is an informal, consensus-based forum without a binding charter or formal exclusion mechanism. No single member state — including the U.S — has the right to expel another, a fact that has been widely acknowledged in prior controversies, such as attempts to exclude Russia, where other members, including China, defended Russia’s status. The U.S is currently feuding with several other G-20 members including Brazil, Canada, and Mexico, with on-off spats with Russia, China, and India.",U.S aid to Pretoria peaked at $ 564 million in 2024 before tailing off to a planned $ 103 million in 2025 amid deteriorating ties underscored by an Oval Office ambush of South Africa’s President Cyril Ramaphosa.

'Discrimination Against American Workers Is Against The Law'





American companies are being warned to stop ignoring domestic American workers in favour of H-1B visa holders. This ultimatum could bring federal penalties as the Trump administration expands its new enforcement drive known as Project Firewall.The initiative was a nudge by US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to clamp down on hiring practices that discriminate against Americans.The Department of Labor said the EEOC has released new rules to remind employers that favouring foreign workers and H-1B holders may violate federal law. The move follows the launch of Project Firewall, which is aimed at protecting the rights and wages of highly skilled American workers and ensuring they are prioritised for jobs.“I applaud the EEOC for standing with the Department of Labor’s mandate under Project Firewall to ensure American workers have a fair chance to compete and succeed,” said Labour Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer. “Under President Trump’s leadership, we will continue working with our federal partners to put an end to bad practices and safeguard opportunities for American workers.”The EEOC’s chair, Andrea Lucas, said the scale of unlawful hiring bias against American citizens required a strong federal response.“With the scale of unlawful anti-American discrimination we’re seeing, robust investigation and enforcement within the EEOC and with our federal partners is essential to protecting America’s workforce,” she said.The EEOC published a new one-page document titled “Discrimination Against American Workers Is Against The Law” and updated its national origin discrimination information hub. These resources explain how discrimination can occur in forms such as job ads, hiring, harassment or retaliation. They rest on Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, existing policy guidance and Supreme Court rulings.The EEOC’s warned that many employers maintain policies that illegally prefer migrants, illegal aliens or non-immigrant guest workers over Americans. “Nothing justifies illegal national origin discrimination whether rooted in cost of labour, customer preferences, or stereotypes,” she said.The EEOC reminded workers that they can file discrimination complaints through its website and noted that it has the authority to investigate and take action against private employers. For state and local government agencies, the EEOC shares responsibility with the Department of Justice (DOJ).",The initiative was a nudge by US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to clamp down on hiring practices that discriminate against Americans.

UN calls on Pakistan to respect Imran Khan's human-rights





Former Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan 's son Kasim Khan on Thursday claimed his father has been kept in a ""death cell with zero transparency"", despite Islamabad refuting rumours that the cricketer-turned-politician was “brutally” assaulted by police for seeking a meeting with their brother last week.Kasim Khan said there have been ""no phone calls, no meetings and no proof of life. Me and my brother have had no contact with our father.""He alleged that the former prime minister, who has been under arrest for 845 days, has been kept in solitary confinement for the past six weeks. He also said that Khan’s sisters have been denied permission to visit him despite court orders allowing access.Kasim further alleged that the Shehbaz Sharif-led government and “its handlers” will be held accountable “legally, morally and internationally”.He also urged the international community to “intervene urgently” and demand proof of life.Earlier, Imran Khan’s sister, Noreen Niazi, accused Pakistani authorities of keeping the former prime minister in harsh prison conditions and cutting off all family contact, claiming that “no one knows what’s happening inside the jail.”Speaking to ANI about her last meeting with the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder, she said, “...Heis going through a tough time alone. He is in isolation... As per the jail manual, one can't be placed in isolation for more than 4 days. But he was put in isolation for three weeks last year as well, during which electricity was switched off, and he wasn't even allowed to read books. The same has been done now.”Her allegations come against the backdrop of growing speculation about Khan’s health and the month-long blackout on family and legal visits. “We don't know anything. They are not telling us anything, nor are they letting anybody meet him,” she said, adding that even PTI members with approved meetings were prevented from entering.“We have not been allowed to meet him for the last four weeks... The Police have been ordered to stop us and, I believe, also given permission to do to us whatever they want. This has never happened in Pakistan before,” she said.Niazi described the treatment of supporters and family members outside Adiala Jail as unprecedented. “No one has ever disrespected women like this, nor has anyone been oppressed this way. This is the first time in Pakistan that these people have been allowed to beat up people like there won't be any consequences, without considering if it's a child, an elderly person, or a woman in front of them. The world is aware of what's happening in Pakistan. ”She called the current situation Pakistan’s “darkest period”, comparing it to “Hitler-era-like repression”, and alleged that people are being “killed, beaten, and jailed without accountability”. She argued that the continued ban on meeting Khan was intentional. “We have been going there for the last four weeks, and they are not letting us meet him. This is why such rumours are spreading.”Warning of growing frustration, she said public anger is nearing a tipping point. “I believe there will be a spark among people soon, and then they will see the level to which the people go... The oppression is too much.”Expressing no expectations from the global community, she said: ""... We have such support from outside that Trump called our dictator Asim Munir a very good friend of his... Shehbaz Sharif had lost his seat. Asim Munir helped him win, so he is the bigger force... Dictators have come before. Their fates were not good either. But how long can these people survive, or how long can they continue to oppress?""Meanwhile, adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah and senior Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leaders on Thursday rejected rumours about former prime minister Imran Khan’s deteriorating health, saying the PTI founder was “fine and nothing is wrong with him,” reported Pakistan daily Dawn News.Earlier in the day, the PTI pressed for a meeting with the jailed leader, expressing concern over his condition after he was denied access to his family and lawyers for more than three weeks. Imran has been in prison since August 2023, serving a 14-year sentence in a corruption case.His family members and party activists have been staging protests outside Adiala Jail in recent days, demanding he be allowed visitors. A PTI delegation once again attempted to meet him on Thursday, but authorities refused permission.The UN's deputy spokesperson reaffirmed that the world body has urged Pakistani authorities to ensure the human rights and due-process rights of Imran Khan are respected.This follows his arrest and ongoing legal proceedings -- the UN has emphasized that in such politically sensitive cases, fair treatment under law and procedural fairness are essential.In a response to ANI, United Nations deputy spokesperson Farhan Haq said, ""We have called for his human rights and due process rights to be respected.""","Kasim Khan claims his father has been kept in a ""death cell with zero transparency"" Islamabad refutes rumours that the cricketer-turned-politician was “brutally” assaulted by police for seeking a meeting with their brother last week.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125628014,imgsize-13768,width-400,resizemode-4/us-bill-seeks-sanctions-on-pakistans-army-chief-demands-imran-khans-release.jpg"

As Pakistan Halts Afghan Transit, Kabul Boosts India Partnership And Fast-Tracks The Chabahar Route





The UAE has stopped issuing visas to Pakistani nationals and only narrowly held back from imposing a complete ban on the Pakistani passport, a senior Pakistani interior ministry official told a parliamentary panel on Thursday.Pakistan’s additional interior secretary Salman Chaudhry informed the Senate Functional Committee on Human Rights that both the UAE and Saudi Arabia had “stopped short of imposing a ban on the Pakistani passport,” as reported by Dawn.“If a ban is imposed, getting it removed would be difficult,” Chaudhry said.Senator Samina Mumtaz Zehri, who chairs the Senate human rights committee, confirmed the interior ministry official’s account in comments to the paper.She said the travel restrictions stemmed from concerns about individuals visiting the UAE and “getting involved in criminal activities”.According to her, the committee was informed that the UAE had largely stopped issuing visas to Pakistani nationals, and that only a limited number had been granted recently, and “after much difficulty”.A Pakistani blue passport is an official travel document reserved for government officials and other eligible personnel, distinguishing it from the standard green passport issued to ordinary citizens.Meanwhile, UAE Ambassador to Pakistan Salem M Salem Al Bawab Al Zaabi briefed Pakistan's finance minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Thursday about “major UAE visa facilitation reforms for Pakistanis,” according to a statement from the minister’s office.The statement added that nearly 500 visas were being processed daily at the newly launched UAE Visa Centre in Pakistan, outlining the reforms highlighted by the envoy.Pakistan and the UAE maintain longstanding diplomatic, economic, and cultural ties. The Gulf nation is among Pakistan’s largest trading partners in the region and a key source of remittances, supported by a sizeable Pakistani workforce residing there.However, Pakistani nationals experienced a surge in visa rejections in early July, prompting interior minister Mohsin Naqvi to take up the matter with his UAE counterpart.","The UAE has stopped issuing visas to Pakistani nationals, a senior Pakistani interior ministry official told a parliamentary panel on Thursday.

IMF Applauds India’s Growth And Reforms, Bails Pakistan Again Out From Economic Burden

(With ANI inputs)





State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) governor Jameel Ahmad has warned that the country’s existing economic growth model “can no longer sustain” its population of 250 million (25 crore).“Our business cycles are shortening and as such, our current growth model simply cannot sustain a country of over 250 million people,” he remarked at the Pakistan Business Council’s Dialogue on the Economy on Wednesday, according to The Express Tribune.Ahmad, who has led the SBP since August 2022, noted that Pakistan’s growth trajectory had been “steadily weakening for decades” — slipping from an average of 3.9 per cent over the past 30 years, to 3.5 per cent in the last two decades, and further down to 3.4 per cent over the past five years.He added that Pakistan had been caught in a “prolonged phase of stabilisation,” during which, he said, citizens and businesses were burdened by steep taxes, high energy costs and unchecked government spending. He urged policymakers and private-sector leaders to move away from short-term fixes and adopt a long-term outlook.Calling the moment an “inflection point,” Ahmad pushed for a shift towards inclusive, sustainable growth, advocating structural reforms and urging businesses to expand their competitiveness by integrating into global value chains, modernising production, and avoiding “shortcuts” for quick profits.Ahmad also highlighted that Pakistan’s external debt nearly doubled from $55 billion to $100 billion between 2015 and 2022 without a corresponding rise in reserves. Since 2022, however, public external debt has remained broadly unchanged while SBP’s reserves have climbed from $2.9 billion to $14.5 billion, aided by $8.4 billion in market purchases during the last fiscal year.His remarks came a day after Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal blamed the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for Pakistan’s highest unemployment rate in 21 years. Unemployment has risen to 7.1 per cent, while the World Bank estimates 44.7 per cent of Pakistanis now live below the poverty line.","State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) governor Jameel Ahmad has warned that the country’s existing economic growth model “can no longer sustain” its population of 250 million (25 crore) Ahmad said Pakistan had been caught in a “prolonged phase of stabilisation,” during which, he said, citizens and businesses were burdened by steep taxes, high energy costs and unchecked government spending.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125617122,imgsize-60374,width-400,resizemode-4/pakistan39s-current-growth-model-cannot-sustain-250-million-population-says-state-bank-governor.jpg"

A young Pakistani woman, missing for 17 years, has been reunited with her family with the help of facial recognition technology and AI.Kiran, now 27, went missing in 2008 when she stepped out to buy ice cream in her Islamabad neighbourhood and forgot her home address. “I was lost and crying. A kind woman took me to the Edhi Centre in Islamabad as I couldn’t remember anything,” she said, news agency PTI reported.A few days later, Bilquis Edhi, wife of the late Abdul Sattar Edhi, founder of the Edhi Foundation, brought Kiran to the Karachi shelter home, where she grew up under Bilquis’ care. Sabah Faisal Edhi, wife of the current chairperson Faisal Edhi, said repeated attempts to trace Kiran’s parents through visits to Islamabad had failed.Earlier this year, the foundation contacted Nabeel Ahmed, a cybersecurity specialist with the Punjab Safe City Project. Using Kiran’s recent photos and limited childhood details, Nabeel accessed a missing-person police report from 2008 and, with facial recognition and tracking software, successfully located her family.Kiran’s father, Abdul Majeed, a tailor, travelled to Karachi to bring her home. “We searched for years, even published her photo in newspapers, but never found her.We had lost hope,” he said.Kiran expressed mixed emotions on returning home. “I am sad to leave my family members here. I will always be grateful to Bilquis apa and everyone at the shelter for taking such good care of me,” she said.She is the fifth girl from the Edhi shelter whose family has been traced with the foundation now working closely with police and Safe City Projects across Pakistan.","Kiran, now 27, went missing in 2008 when she stepped out to buy ice cream in her Islamabad neighbourhood and forgot her home address.

Pakistan's Adiala Jail Issues Statement On Imran Khan's Health Amid Viral Death Rumours





The Adiala Jail administration on Wednesday dismissed rumours and confirmed that former Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan remains inside the Rawalpindi prison and is in good health.This comes amid growing speculation regarding the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder’s whereabouts.“There is no truth to reports about his transfer from Adiala Jail,” officials said in a statement. They added that Khan was “fully healthy and receiving complete medical attention.”The authorities further rejected the claims about any deterioration in his condition, calling it “baseless,” according to Geo TV.The clarification comes at a time when social media has been flooded with unverified claims, including suggestions from accounts based in Pakistan and Afghanistan alleging that Khan had been harmed or killed inside the prison.Khan has been behind bars since August 2023 and faces several cases, including corruption and terrorism-related charges. The accusations were filed after he was ousted from office through a no-confidence vote in April 2022.Meanwhile, defence minister Khawaja Asif claimed that the former premier was being kept in conditions far more comfortable than those faced by previous prisoners.“Check the menu of the food that comes for him — it is not available even in a five-star hotel,” Asif said.He added that Khan had access to a television, exercise equipment, a double bed and a velvet mattress, according to Geo TV.Recalling his own incarceration, he said, “We slept on cold floors, ate jail food, and had only two blankets in January with no hot water,” accusing PTI leaders of exaggerating Khan’s condition.“Fear God — no one owns time,” the defence minister added.The rumours intensified after Khan’s three sisters were allegedly assaulted by police personnel outside Adiala Jail last week while trying to meet him.Noreen Niazi, one of the sisters, said they were peacefully protesting concerns over Khan’s health when streetlights were “abruptly switched off,” followed by what she described as a “brutal and orchestrated assault.”""We peacefully protested over concerns for his health condition. We neither blocked roads nor obstructed public movement, nor engaged in any unlawful conduct. Yet, without warning or provocation, the streetlights in the area were abruptly switched off, deliberately casting the scene into darkness. What followed was a brutal and orchestrated assault by Punjab police personnel,” Noreen Niazi said.“At the age of 71, I was seized by my hair, thrown violently to the ground, and dragged across the road, sustaining visible injuries,” she added.Thousands of PTI supporters later gathered outside the facility, demanding permission to meet Khan and protesting against restrictions imposed by the government, which has reportedly barred visits to the former prime minister for over a month.Earlier, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Sohail Afridi was also denied multiple requests to meet Khan, a decision the PTI alleges is influenced by security forces.",Pakistan's Adiala Jail Issues Statement On Imran Khan's Health Amid Viral Death Rumours.

Key findings





Institutional weaknesses





Context and IMF programmes









The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned that persistent corruption and “state capture” in Pakistan are at the root of its ongoing economic crisis, where public policy is manipulated to benefit a narrow circle of political and business elites.The findings are part of the Governance and Corruption Diagnostic Assessment (GCDA), finalised in November 2025 and requested by the Pakistani government. The 186-page report paints a grim picture of dysfunctional institutions unable to enforce the rule of law or safeguard public resources, reported AljazeeraAccording to the IMF, corruption in Pakistan is “persistent and corrosive”, distorting markets, eroding public trust, and undermining fiscal stability. The report warns that without dismantling structures of “elite privilege”, economic stagnation will continue.“Failure of implementation [of laws and principles of accountability] gives vested interests too often free rein and addressing this must be at the core of efforts for economic reform,” said Stefan Dercon, professor of economic policy at the University of Oxford.The GCDA highlights that corruption is most damaging when privileged entities exert influence over key economic sectors, including state-owned or affiliated industries.The IMF estimates that tax exemptions and subsidies to such entities drain billions annually, limiting private sector growth.Ali Hasanain, associate professor at Lahore University of Management Sciences, said the IMF’s conclusions are consistent with prior domestic and international studies.“Powerful interests shape rules to maintain their advantage,” Hasanain told Al Jazeera, noting similar findings in a 2021 UNDP report.The report estimates that Pakistan could achieve 5–6.5 per cent GDP growth over five years by implementing governance reforms. Pakistan’s GDP stood at $340 billion in 2024.The IMF identifies the special investment facilitation council (SIFC) and public sector entities as major areas of concern. The SIFC, formed in June 2023 to promote investment, operates with limited transparency and legal accountability. The report urges the council to publish annual investment reports and details of concessions granted.The judiciary and key anti-corruption bodies like the national accountability bureau (NAB) and federal investigation agency (FIA) are also flagged. The judiciary faces over two million pending cases, while selective accountability by NAB has damaged public trust. Despite recovering 5.3 trillion rupees ($17 billion) in 2023–24, NAB’s low conviction rates remain a concern.The GCDA criticises recent constitutional amendments that created a parallel Federal Constitutional Court, warning that they could increase executive influence over judicial appointments.Pakistan has turned to the IMF 25 times since 1958. The current programme, initiated under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, is a 37-month, $7 billion arrangement, with a $1.2 billion tranche expected next month. The country narrowly avoided default in 2023.The report underscores that state capture and elite privilege—through tax exemptions, regulatory capture, and subsidies—remain systemic challenges. Implementing reforms, the IMF argues, could significantly restore economic growth, fiscal stability, and public trust.","Pakistan has turned to the IMF 25 times since 1958.

Five phases of cross-border terror: 1947–2025



Phase I (1947–1971): Foundational conflicts





Phase II (1972–1989): Proxy warfare





Phase III (1990–2000): Urban terror expands





Phase IV (2001–2009): National symbols targeted



Phase V (2010–2025): Adaptive terrorism and stronger Indian response



India’s resilience



NEW DELHI: A report released on Wednesday by NatStrat, a Delhi-based strategic affairs think tank, claims that Pakistan has used terrorism as a state instrument against India since 1947, with cross-border operations evolving through five distinct phases over nearly eight decades. The release coincided with the 17th anniversary of the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks.The study, titled ‘Chronology of Pakistani Terror Attacks on India: 1947–2025’, says records since Independence indicate a “consistent strategy” by Pakistan’s military and intelligence establishment, particularly the inter-services intelligence (ISI), to deploy terrorism as part of its policy framework.""The history of Pakistan-sponsored terrorism against India needs to be told and retold,"" the NatStrat compilation states.The report categorises the trajectory of Pakistan-origin terrorism into five periods - foundational conflicts (1947–71), the rise of proxy warfare (1972–89), escalation and urban attacks (1990–2000), targeting national symbols (2001–09), and adaptive terrorism with hardened Indian responses (2010–25).The period begins with the Poonch uprising and the tribal invasion of Jammu & Kashmir in 1947–48, followed by Operation Gibraltar (1965) and Operation Chengiz KhanPakistan’s pre-emptive strike in 1971.India’s counteroffensive culminated in the surrender of 93,000 Pakistani troops and the creation of Bangladesh.The report recounts plane hijackings, targeted killings - including the 1984 murder of diplomat Ravindera Mhatre - and ISI backing the Khalistan movement. The hijackings of Indian Airlines flights in 1971 and 1984 are cited as early examples of Pakistan’s covert strategy.Pakistan-backed groups, including Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), escalated militancy in J&K through the K2 project. Major urban attacks included the 1993 Mumbai serial blasts, 1996 Lajpat Nagar blast, 1998 Coimbatore bombings, the 1999 Kargil intrusion, and the IC-814 hijacking.Key attacks in this era include the 2001 Parliament attack, 2002 Akshardham temple assault, the 2005 Delhi blasts, 2006 Mumbai train bombings, and the 26/11 Mumbai attacks, which killed 166 and brought India-Pakistan ties to a breaking point.The report tracks attacks like the 2010 German Bakery blast, 2016 Pathankot and Uri attacks, and 2019 Pulwama bombing. It also lists recent incidents, including the 2025 Pahalgam attack, claimed by ‘The Resistance Front,’ and India’s retaliatory Operation Sindoor , which defence minister Rajnath Singh described as treating “any attack on Indian soil as an act of war.”The report stresses that cross-border terror has not deterred India’s progress. ""They have not stopped India's march as a nation. Instead, Indian society and polity have pushed back attempts to divide the country or slow down its progress,"" it notes.Calling terrorism an affront to humanity, the report says state-backed terrorism poses a grave threat to global stability.""It is a scourge that affects the whole world and must be fought unitedly, without reservation or double standards.""NatStrat is convened by Pankaj Saran, a former diplomat with four decades of experience, who has served in the prime minister’s office, national security council secretariat, and as India’s envoy to Russia and Bangladesh. He also served as deputy national security adviser.The compilation is dedicated to victims of terrorism and those who have fought against it, offering a detailed account of what it calls Pakistan’s “decades-long hybrid warfare” and India’s evolving response.(With inputs from agencies)",Report claims Pakistan has used terrorism as a state instrument against India since 1947.

Pakistan Issues Naval Warning as Its War Games Overlap with India’s Military Drills





NEW DELHI: The Pakistan Navy has ""successfully test-fired"" an indigenously developed ship-launched anti-ship ballistic missile, according to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the Pakistani military's information wing.""The trial was carried out from a locally produced naval platform, enhancing the country’s defence capabilities. The missile can engage both sea and land targets with high accuracy and incorporates advanced guidance systems along with improved manoeuvrability,"" the ISPR noted.""President Asif Ali Zardari, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee General Sahir Shamshad Mirza, and the heads of the armed forces congratulated the teams of scientists, engineers, and operational units involved,"" it added.Separately, a Pakistan Navy spokesperson highlighted that the launch underscored the country’s ""growing technological capacity"" and reaffirmed the service’s commitment to safeguarding national interests.Pakistan has been stepping up efforts to expand its defence capabilities since the May conflict with India, which came to a halt following a ceasefire request by Islamabad.

NEW DELHI: Direct flights between Pakistan and Bangladesh will start next month, marking a significant boost to connectivity between the two countries, Bangladesh’s ambassador to Pakistan announced on Wednesday.There have been no direct air links for several years between the two, which were part of one country - Pakistan - until 1971. Bangladesh — formerly East Pakistan — became independent after the India-Pakistan war of December 1971. Bilateral relations, long shaped by this history, have begun to improve notably since the 2024 ouster of then-Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.“Mahan Air will begin operating three weekly flights between Dhaka and Karachi from next month,” Bangladesh’s High Commissioner to Pakistan, Iqbal Hussain Khan said. Dhaka is Bangladesh’s capital and largest city, while Karachi is Pakistan’s biggest metropolis; both rank among the world’s most populated urban centres.Khan did not specify the exact launch date or share further operational details.He also highlighted that the visa process has been simplified. “Visas are now being issued on the joint recommendation of Lahore Chamber of Commerce & Industry (LCCI) and the Bangladesh Honorary Consulate in Lahore,” he noted.Travellers can expect visas within three to four days, he added, describing the change as a step that will make cross-border movement faster and more convenient.The envoy emphasised that the new air links “will be a significant leap in strengthening connectivity between the two countries.”Mahan Airlines, which operates as Mahan Air, is a privately owned Iranian carrier. In addition, two Pakistani private airlines — Fly Jinnah and AirSial — have already received approval from Bangladesh’s aviation authorities to commence direct flights.Khan also disclosed that a direct cargo shipping service will be launched soon. “Although a cargo service has been operational since last December, rising trade volumes now demand a dedicated direct route,” he explained.Relations between the two countries have warmed in recent months. Following the August 5, 2024 ouster of Sheikh Hasina amid widespread student-led protests, and the appointment of Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus as Chief Adviser of the interim government, Dhaka and Islamabad have increased engagement across multiple fronts."," direct flights between Pakistan and Bangladesh will start next month.

TL;DR Driving the news

'Necessary Response At Proper Time': Taliban Vows Action After 10 Killed In Pak Strikes

What changed: The 27th Amendment





Passed in five days without broad consultation, the amendment:

Created a new Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) - removing constitutional jurisdiction from the Supreme Court.

Gave the president power to transfer judges - effectively coercing judicial loyalty.

Handed lifetime immunity to the president and military chiefs - beyond the reach of courts.

Eliminated the post of Chairman Joint Chiefs and established a Chief of Defence Forces - placing all services under Field Marshal Asim Munir.

Why it matters





A civilian-military consolidation of power unseen since the days of General Pervez Musharraf.

The official death of judicial independence, according to resigning justices and legal experts.

A reshuffling of Pakistan's political DNA - where the army writes the script, judges act the scenes, and a veiled mystic, Bushra Bibi , remains a ghost in the wings.

, remains a ghost in the wings. “We are facing completely uncharted territory,” warned constitutional lawyer Asad Rahim Khan.

The big picture: A triangle of power





Field Marshal Asim Munir: commander of all armed services, architect of the new order.

Imran Khan: jailed, disqualified, but symbolically invincible.

Bushra Bibi: spiritual advisor-turned-political wife, whose journey from Pakpattan to Islamabad may yet reshape the battlefield.

Together - or more accurately, against each other - they define Pakistan’s struggle between civilian populism, military dominance, and spiritual mysticism.

The new triumvirate: The general, the pirni & the cricketer





Asim Munir: The new pharaoh

All armed services via the new title Chief of Defence Forces

The nuclear command (transferred from civilians)

His own legal protection, via lifetime immunity

Parliament, by proxy of pliant coalitions

“Field marshals don't retire. They may leave a post, but they remain field marshal for life.” Shuja Nawaz on Munir

Imran Khan: Popularity in captivity





His party, despite rigging, won 93 out of 266 seats in 2024 elections.

His speeches are censored, yet his words circulate like sacred scripture.

His rivals - from Shehbaz Sharif to Zardari - struggle to match his moral authority.

Bushra Bibi: The mystic in the mirror





Predicted Khan’s rise to power - prompting their 2018 secret marriage.

Selected cabinet appointments by reading photographs.

The ISI angle





Bushra behind bars





Unlawful marriage (violating the Islamic waiting period)

Saudi gifts corruption scandal

Land deal redirection for an Islamic university

Yet none of these - even when supported by leaked audios and courtroom theatrics - have cracked public perception.

“Bushra has not made herself my weakness,” Khan said from his cell. “Her bravery has made me stronger.”

Between the lines





This is not just a crisis of governance - it’s a recasting of Pakistan’s founding vision.

From constitutional democracy to executive-military command

From judicial review to judicial obedience

From public representation to spiritual symbolism

What’s next





Munir had been due to retire in 2027. Now, he is set to oversee the 2028 elections, installing loyalist judges and neutering opposition.

What if Khan compromises - freeing himself and Bushra in exchange for political silence.

Then there is the risk of popular backlash erupting-driven by youth, lawyers, and civil society.

For now, the regime holds the cards. But as with every overreach in Pakistan’s history - from Zia to Musharraf - backlash often comes not as revolution, but as decay.

Bottom line





The Field Marshal cannot be arrested

The Supreme Court cannot speak

The President cannot be questioned

And the people’s vote barely matters





On paper, the 27th Constitutional Amendment is 59 clauses of dense legalese. In practice, it reads like a character study of three people: a jailed former cricket hero, his mystic wife, and a general-turned-field marshal who now enjoys lifetime immunity.On November 14, 2025, Pakistan enacted the 27th Constitutional Amendment - a sweeping legal overhaul that granted lifetime immunity to President Asif Ali Zardari and Field Marshal Asim Munir , while transforming the judiciary into an executive-led structure.Two Supreme Court judges resigned. Opposition parties stormed out of Parliament. And somewhere in a prison cell in Adiala, Imran Khan , Pakistan’s most popular politician, began writing a letter - alone, without books or newspapers.“Parliament has done what previous dictators could only dream of,” said legal analyst Mirza Moiz Baig.“This is autocratic legalism,” warned Aqil Shah of Georgetown University. “In no other democracy is the army chief of staff the designated joint service chief,” Shah told AFP.The 27th Amendment isn’t just constitutional tinkering. It represents:In a scathing editorial, Dawn argued that “with this, the separation of powers and basic structure established by the 1973 Constitution of Pakistan - which envisioned an independent judiciary and armed forces subservient to the civilian dispensation - now stands terminated.”It noted the irony that “instead of the military, an independent judiciary has been amended away into a subservient department of the executive branch. ”“The funeral rites for the judiciary have been performed,” said the editorial.Pakistan’s new regime is no longer about parties. It’s now a triumvirate:Munir rose through the ranks as quartermaster general and Corps Commander Gujranwala, then as head of Military Intelligence and, eventually, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). In 2019 he was removed as intelligence chief “just eight months into his stint, under then-prime minister Imran Khan and for reasons that have never been made public.”That sacking is widely seen in Pakistan as the first major clash between Munir and Imran Khan.Now elevated to Field Marshal, Asim Munir controls:“He probably has as much power as Musharraf,” said military analyst Shuja Nawaz. “Like Musharraf, he has a subservient prime minister and the authority to reshape the army's structure,” Nawaz told AFP.And unlike Musharraf, Munir doesn’t wear the scars of a military coup - he wears constitutional legitimacy.Former Prime Minister Imran Khan - held in solitary confinement, his party symbol banned, and facing dozens of legal cases - still commands unmatched national support.“He is still seen as Pakistan’s moral sovereign,” noted a leading historian.But behind bars, choices are narrowing. Some in PTI want compromise. Bushra Bibi, too, is reportedly inclined toward negotiation.As per a profile of Bushra Bibi in the Economist, by the mid-2010s, Imran Khan was at a personal and political low. Then came the introduction to Bushra Manika, a middle-aged woman from Punjab with a reputation as a Sufi-inclined spiritual guide. Their relationship began with late-night phone calls, before turning into visits to her family home in Pakpattan. According to 1843, Bushra’s then-husband, Khawar Manika, initially enjoyed the glamour but became uneasy as his wife’s intimacy with Khan grew. He recalled asking: “Why can’t we sit together?” and described walking into rooms to find conversations abruptly cut short.Manika later told 1843 that his wife had shared a prophecy with Khan: if they married, he would become prime minister. She divorced Manika at the end of 2017 and married Khan in a secret ceremony on January 1st 2018. Khan later told a British newspaper, “Sufism is an order with many levels, but I have never met anyone who is as high as my wife.”As per the Economist, few first ladies in modern history have combined veiled mysticism, political access, and whispered intrigue quite like Bushra Bibi.Once a pirni from Pakpattan, she:“Her interference was absolute,” a member of Imran Khan’s cabinet told the Economist.“He cannot see beyond that Sufi halo she carries around her,” added close friend Salman Ahmad.Per the Economist’s reporting, ISI officers allegedly used a pir to funnel intelligence to Bushra, who then passed it to Khan as revelations from dreams - reinforcing her mystical power and his trust in her.“Faiz was feeding information to Bushra Bibi through her pir,” confirmed ex-ally Faisal Vawda.“That’s how Khan started getting blinded.”But what the spy agency built, it later dismantled. When Khan sacked Asim Munir as ISI chief in 2019, allegedly after he raised corruption concerns about Bushra, the seeds of retaliation were planted.Bushra Bibi now shares Khan’s fate - imprisoned, silenced, and at the center of three separate cases:“No ordinary Pakistani will remain unaffected,” Dawn warned.“When the state is tried by a court that it has hand-picked, the citizen will lose every time.”This crisis leaves Pakistan at a crossroads:This isn’t just about one amendment, or one general, or one mystic wife. It’s about a state remade in secret, then rubber-stamped in Parliament, where:But still, whispers from prison echo across Pakistan - from Khan’s letters to Bushra’s mysticism and protests.(With inputs from agencies)",The 27th Amendment to Pakistan's constitution was passed in five days without broad consultation.

Suicide Bombers Storm Pakistan’s FC Headquarters In Peshawar As Explosions Rock High-Security Zone





A coordinated attack involving suicide bombers and gunmen targeted the headquarters of the Federal Constabulary (FC) paramilitary force in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Peshawar on Monday. Rebel group Jamaat-ul-Ahrar (JuA) has claimed responsibility for the attack. While the group claimed around two dozen casualties and death of three of its fighters, Pakistani authorities said there were six deaths, including that of three soldiers.The JuA, which is comprised of soldiers from Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), was also behind the suicide bombing at a judicial complex in Islamabad a day after the blast in Delhi. Monday's operation began with a suicide bomber detonating explosives at the main entrance of the highly secured FC headquarters, a compound located in a densely populated area on Sunehri Masjid Road in Peshawar Cantonment.Following the initial blast, at least two other attackers breached the premises and engaged security forces, sources said. Several personnel and civilians were also reported injured and rushed to nearby hospitals.Over two dozen people were admitted for treatment.Peshawar capital city police officer Mian Saeed Ahmad told local media that the three personnel killed were stationed at the main gate. Ahmad claimed that the quick response of security forces resulted in the timely elimination of the remaining two attackers, preventing a potentially high casualty count as a large number of personnel were reportedly gathered inside for parade drills.A representative of JuA posted on Telegram about the attack, saying: ""Three suicide mujahideen are participating in the attack. We want the complete and 100% implementation of Sharia. If the enemy agrees to 99% but refuses even 1%, then our jihad against them will continue. Insha'Allah...""The JuA split from TTP in 2014 due to ideological differences. However, it joined hands with TTP again a few years ago. The recent resurgence in militancy has been attributed to TTP and its associated groups, including JuA.",Rebel group Jamaat-ul-Ahrar (JuA) claimed responsibility for the attack.

Ousted PM Sheikh Hasina Faces Fresh Conviction as Court Awards 21-Year Term





A Bangladesh court on Thursday sentenced ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina to 21 years in prison in three corruption cases linked to alleged irregularities in land allocations under a government housing project.The verdict adds to the mounting legal troubles facing Hasina, who is already under a separate death sentence for her role in last year’s violent crackdown.Judge Mohammad Abdullah Al Mamun of Dhaka’s Special Judge Court-5 sentenced Hasina to three separate seven-year prison terms in corruption cases linked to the Rajuk New Town Project in Purbachal, bringing the total to 21 years to be served consecutively.He also fined her Taka one lakh in each case, with an additional 18 months in jail if the fines are not paid.The court also sentenced Hasina’s son, Sajib Wajed Joy, and daughter, Saima Wazed Putul, to five years in prison each in related cases involving the same housing project. Both were fined Taka one lakh, with a one-month default sentence for non-payment.""The plot was allotted to Sheikh Hasina without any application and in a manner that exceeded the legally authorised jurisdiction,"" Judge Mamun said while delivering the sentence, as cited by PTI.The latest verdict comes just 10 days after a special tribunal sentenced Hasina to death in absentia for “crimes against humanity” linked to her government’s violent crackdown on student-led protests last year.She has rejected all allegations, insisting the charges are “biased and politically motivated.”Hasina has been living in exile in New Delhi since August 2024, after fleeing Bangladesh at the end of her 15-year rule. The Ministry of External Affairs said on Wednesday that Dhaka’s request for her extradition is currently under examination.Dhaka has repeatedly requested New Delhi to extradite the leader of the banned Awami League party, but India is not automatically required to comply. Under the 2013 extradition treaty, requests can be refused if the offence is considered “political” or if extradition would be “unjust or oppressive.”","Sheikh Hasina sentenced to 21 years in prison in three corruption cases.

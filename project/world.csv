Syria's neighboring foreign ministers call for lifting sanctions and reconciliation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/syrias-neighboring-foreign-ministers-call-for-lifting-sanctions-and-reconciliation/articleshow/118827885.cms,"Relatives and neighbours mourn during the funeral procession for four Syrian security force members killed in clashes with loyalists of ousted President Bashar Assad in coastal Syria, in the village of Al-Janoudiya, west of Idlib, Saturday, March 8, 2025.

AMMAN: Syria's top diplomat and his counterparts from neighboring countries Sunday called for the lifting of Western-led sanctions on Syria and post-war reconciliation.The foreign ministers of Turkey, Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon made their remarks alongside Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad Hassan al-Shibani following a meeting in the Jordanian capital Amman.They come following days of clashes between Syrian security forces and insurgents of the minority Alawite community loyal to the deposed Bashar Assad government in Syria's coastal province. Some rights groups say hundreds of civilians, mostly Alawite, were killed in revenge attacks after the fighting broke out. The Associated Press could not independently verify those numbers.The United States and Europe have been hesitant to lift sanctions on Syria before there is a clear political transition that is democratic and inclusive of Syria’s minorities and civil society. At the same time, the country desperately needs money to rebuild after years of war and pull millions out of poverty. The United Nations estimates that some 90% of Syria’s population lives in poverty.“We are protecting all components of the Syrian people, and we do not discriminate between them. We will not allow the repetition of the tragedies of the Syrian people,” said al-Shibani.Syria's new Islamist authorities under interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa have struggled to convince the United States and Europe to lift sanctions to start rebuilding the country after 13 years of war and reconcile with the Kurds in the northeast and Druze in the south to exert state authority across the country.The weekend's violence appears likely to stymie attempts to remove sanctions in the immediate future. The U.S. and U.N. released statements condemning the killing of civilians, which U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio described as being carried out by “radical Islamist terrorists, including foreign jihadis.” He called for Damascus to hold the perpetrators accountable.Also on Sunday, al-Sharaa announced the formation of a committee tasked with investigating the violence in coastal communities, including “violations against civilians” and another one tasked with “maintaining civil peace.”Al-Sharaa said in a video statement that the outbreak of violence was part of “attempts by remnants of the former regime, with foreign parties behind them, to create new strife and drag our country to a civil war, with the goal of dividing it and destroying its unity and stability.”He said the country’s new authorities “will not tolerate the remnants of Assad who committed crimes against our army forces and state institutions” and promised to “hold accountable with all firmness and without leniency anyone who was involved in the blood of civilians or harmed our people.”It remained to be seen whether those measures will succeed in calming the situation and reassuring both Syrians and the international community.Syria's neighbors fear that the country's pulverized economy and internal tensions could impact their own stability.“Stability in Syria requires dialogue with the country's various components,” said Iraqi Foreign Minister Fouad Hussein at a joint news conference.The foreign ministers were critical of what they said was foreign intervention in the region after Israeli troops conducted military operations in southern Syria and seized a U.N. buffer zone that divides Syria from the Golan Heights, which Israel seized and annexed in 1967. On Sunday, the Israeli commanding officers visited and assessed the buffer zone.Turkish Foreign Minister Fidan welcomed the “historic” meeting and called for cooperation to decrease tension in Syria, and said he alongside others will work against sleeper cells belonging to the extremist Islamic State group and affiliates of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party in Syria and Iraq.“This is a regional problem. Regardless of our ideals we should all combat IS as well as the PKK, they are both terrorist entities,” he added.Iraq's foreign minister warned that IS sleeper cells are growing in numbers.“We need to take the initiative first in exchanging views and information about (the Islamic State group's) latest operations and especially their expansion not only on the Syrian borders with Iraq and Jordan but also their expansion in the Syrian land,” said Hussein.","The foreign ministers of Turkey, Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon made their remarks alongside Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad Hassan al-Shibani following a meeting in the Jordanian capital Amman.

A leader of Columbia University protests against Israel's war in Gaza was arrested by immigration officers, a campus union said Sunday, after US President Donald Trump vowed to deport foreign pro-Palestinian student demonstrators.Mahmoud Khalil , one of the most prominent faces in the campus's protest movement that erupted in response to Israel's conduct of the war, was arrested Saturday, the Student Workers of Columbia union said.""On Saturday, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officers detained Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian recent Columbia graduate and lead negotiator for last spring's Gaza solidarity encampment,"" the union said in a statement.US campuses including Columbia's in New York were rocked by student protests against Israel's war in Gaza following the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack. The demonstrations ignited accusations of anti-Semitism.Protests, some of which turned violent and saw campus buildings occupied and lectures disrupted, pitted students protesting Israel's conduct against pro-Israel campaigners, many of whom were Jewish.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio wrote on X that ""we will be revoking the visas and/or green cards of Hamas supporters in America so they can be deported.""Khalil, who remains in immigration enforcement detention, held permanent residency at the time of his arrest prompting thousands of people to sign a petition calling for his release, the union statement added.""We are also aware of multiple reports of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents accessing or attempting to access Columbia campus buildings on Friday and Saturday, including undergraduate dorms,"" the union said.Columbia did not directly address Khalil's arrest in response to inquiries, but in a statement said ""there have been reports of ICE in the streets around campus.""""Columbia has and will continue to follow the law. Consistent with our longstanding practice and the practice of cities and institutions throughout the country, law enforcement must have a judicial warrant to enter non-public University areas, including University buildings,"" Columbia said.The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment.Trump railed against the student protest movement linked to the conflict in Gaza, and vowed to deport foreign students who had demonstrated.He also threatened to cut off federal funding for institutions that he said were not doing enough to combat anti-Semitism.His administration announced Friday it was cutting $400 million in federal grants to Columbia University, accusing it of failing to protect Jewish students from harassment.",Mahmoud Khalil was one of the most prominent faces in the campus's protest movement.

SEOUL: North Korea on Monday condemned joint US-South Korean military drills as a ""provocative act"", warning of the danger of sparking war with ""an accidental single shot,"" days after Seoul's air force mistakenly bombed a village on its own territory.""This is a dangerous provocative act of leading the acute situation on the Korean peninsula, which may spark off a physical conflict between the two sides by means of an accidental single shot,"" said Pyongyang's foreign ministry, as quoted by state media.The joint US-South Korea "" Freedom Shield 2025 "" exercise was set to kick off on Monday, and will involve ""live, virtual, and field-based training"", according to a US statement.The exercise will run until March 21, the statement said.Military cooperation between Seoul and Washington regularly invites condemnation from Pyongyang, where the government sees such moves as preparation for an invasion, and often carries out missile tests in response.The latest exercise comes after two South Korean Air Force fighter jets accidentally dropped eight bombs on a village during a joint training exercise with US forces on March 6.Fifteen people, including civilians and military personnel, were wounded in that incident, South Korea's National Fire Agency said.Relations between Pyongyang and Seoul have been at one of their lowest points in years, with the North launching a flurry of ballistic missiles last year in violation of UN sanctions.The two Koreas remain technically at war since their 1950-1953 conflict ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty.The United States stations tens of thousands of soldiers in the South, in part to protect Seoul against Pyongyang.The large-scale Freedom Shield exercises are one of the allies' biggest annual joint exercises.In its statement on Monday, North Korea's foreign ministry dubbed the exercises ""an aggressive and confrontational war rehearsal"".Last week, Pyongyang slammed the United States for ""political and military provocations"" over the visit of a US Navy aircraft carrier to the South Korean port of Busan.","North Korea condemns joint US-South Korean military drills as a ""provocative act"" Pyongyang warns of the danger of sparking war with ""an accidental single shot"" Comes after Seoul's air force mistakenly bombed a village on its own territory.

Croatia is trying a Roman emperor’s price cap to tame inflation. Will it work?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/croatia-is-trying-a-roman-emperors-price-cap-to-tame-inflation-will-it-work/articleshow/118827556.cms,"File photo

SPLIT (CROATIA): In AD 301, Emperor Diocletian made a bold but ultimately unsuccessful bid to address the inflation that was rampaging across the eastern half of the divided Roman Empire. Prices of everything from purple thread and feathers to cattle were dictated by his Edict on Maximum Prices. Violators faced the death penalty. Diocletian gave up power about four years after issuing his edict, watching his measure fail from his sprawling retirement palace in the heart of what became the city of Split in Croatia.Now Croatia’s govt is trying a similar tactic to rein in prices, which have soared in recent years and have sparked protests and retail boycotts by the country’s beleaguered consumers. The govt introduced price controls for retailers last month, targeting supermarket items such as bread, pork and shampoo. The penalties are less drastic than those decreed by Diocletian, mandating a fine of up to €30,000, for retailers breaking the rules. It is unclear whether the new edict will be any more successful than Diocletian’s, which economists say ended up being counterproductive by causing shortages, fuelling a black market and enabling profiteers. For the moment, consumers are still figuring out how to navigate the new system, which caps the price of 70 common grocery store products.Anita Kargotic, 62, went shopping recently at a Spar supermarket, where two signs were posted outside listing the maximum prices allowed for a range of goods. She tied her American Akita, named Maja, to a post outside, and later emerged from the store with a haul of kaiser rolls, popcorn kernels, soy flakes and crackers. Most were store-brand gene rics, already less expensive than more recognisable labels.Flea collars and dry dog food? Those are necessities. Grapes? No, too expensive. Staples like rice and pasta? Pass. “Those prices have become completely unreasonable,” she said.The new rules are the govt’s third attempt at controlling prices by fiat since Sept 2022. The first two efforts were largely ineffective, with retailers simply refusing to stock most pricecontrolled goods. The govt says it is serious this time, and it has promised regular inspections and fines for violators.Under the new rules brought in by PM Andrej Plenkovic, shop entrances must display a list of all 70 items that fall under the govt’s pricing regulations. Centuries ago, Diocleti an’s edict accused some citizens of price gouging and said their greed needed to be reined in. In Jan, Plenkovic struck a similar tone. “We support companies that work well and make a profit, but within realistic frames. That can’t be at the expense of the little guy,” he said.Many people say price controls are not the answer. John H. Cochrane, an economist, pointed to the role Diocletian’s edict played in causing shortages and fuelling a black market. “It’s like trying to stem the symptoms rather than treating the underlying disease,” Cochrane said of price controls.","Croatia's govt is trying a similar tactic to rein in prices, which have soared in recent years.

973 civilians killed in Syria in ‘one of the biggest massacres’ since Assad’s fall: War monitor,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/973-civilians-killed-in-syria-in-one-of-the-biggest-massacres-since-assads-fall-war-monitor/articleshow/118827412.cms,"AP photo





Hundreds of Alawite civilians killed in ‘executions’ by Syria’s security forces • FRANCE 24

A Syrian war monitor reported on Monday that security forces and allied groups have killed 973 civilians in a series of ""massacres"" in coastal areas and the Latakia Mountains since March 6.The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said, ""The total number of civilian martyrs who were liquidated amounted to 973, including women and children,"" adding that ""killings, field executions, and ethnic cleansing operations"" were still ongoing following deadly clashes between security forces and Alawite gunmen loyal to toppled president Bashar al-Assad.Syria has been in turmoil since Bashar al-Assad was overthrown in December. The insurgent-led government that replaced him has struggled to maintain control, and tensions have exploded into sectarian violence. Clashes between security forces and Assad loyalists have triggered widespread attacks, particularly against the Alawite community, which was the backbone of Assad’s regime.The bloodshed began on Thursday when government forces attempted to detain a suspect near Jableh but were ambushed by armed Assad supporters. In response, security forces launched crackdowns in Alawite strongholds along the Mediterranean coast. Authorities claim they were targeting remnants of Assad’s forces but admitted that ""individual actions"" contributed to the killings.Under Assad, Alawites dominated the military and security agencies. Now, they are being targeted as the new government blames Assad loyalists for ongoing attacks.In several areas, Alawites have faced retribution killings, looting, and arson. Witnesses described horrific scenes where gunmen stormed homes, executed Alawites in the streets, and set properties on fire. Thousands have fled into the mountains, fearing further attacks.One of the worst-hit towns, Baniyas, saw bodies left uncollected in the streets as residents were too afraid to retrieve them. Ali Sheha, a 57-year-old resident, told AFP that at least 20 of his neighbours had been killed, some inside their shops and homes. ""Gunmen were firing at houses, looting shops, and checking IDs to execute Alawites,"" he said.By early Saturday, the revenge killings had slowed, but the devastation was immense. Observatory chief Rami Abdurrahman called it ""one of the biggest massacres"" of the conflict.","The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said, ""The total number of civilian martyrs who were liquidated amounted to 973, including women and children"" Witnesses described horrific scenes where gunmen stormed homes, executed Alawites in the streets, and set properties on fire.

What's Daylight Saving Time

?

When does it begin?

Is Daylight Saving Time worth it? Debate rages on

What Trump said

Trump Asked When He Will Get Rid Of Daylight Saving Time, Says It Is A '50/50 Issue'

Clocks in the US will jump an hour on Sunday, marking the start of Daylight Saving Time . This annual practice moves clocks forward by one hour during the summer months.It’s an yearly practice in the US and Europe to move clocks forward during summer, extending evening daylight to optimise energy use and better align daily schedules with natural light.In North America, Daylight Saving Time 2025 will begin on Sunday, March 9, at 2:00 AM local standard time and will end on November 2 at 2:00 AM.At that moment, clocks will move forward one hour to 3:00 AM local daylight time. This change extends evening daylight but shortens the morning hours. While most of the United States observes DST, some regions do not follow the springtime adjustment.In Europe, Daylight Saving Time will start on March 30, 2025, at 1:00 AM GMT, with clocks moving forward by one hour. Most European countries follow this change to extend daylight hours during the spring and summer months.After winning the election last year, Trump had said he and Republicans would work to “eliminate” daylight saving time, calling it inconvenient and costly.However, when asked in the Oval Office on Thursday about eliminating Daylight Saving Time, Trump said, “It’s a 50-50 issue, and when something is split like that, it’s hard to get excited about it.”Trump said he figured most people would prefer more daylight in the evening but acknowledged that “some people want more light in the morning because they don’t want to take their kids to school in the dark.”","Clocks in the US will jump an hour on Sunday, marking the start of Daylight Saving Time.

Canada's Liberal Party race to replace Justin Trudeau as party leader: Who has the best shot?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/canadas-liberal-party-race-to-replace-justin-trudeau-as-party-leader-who-has-the-best-shot/articleshow/118813261.cms,"Pictures: Associated Press

Mark Carney

Chrystia Freeland

Canada's Liberal leadership hopefuls make final pitch ahead of vote to replace Trudeau

Canada’s Liberal Party is set to choose a new leader to replace Justin Trudeau, with the announcement expected on Sunday. The two frontrunners are Mark Carney , a former central banker known for his economic expertise, and Chrystia Freeland , Trudeau’s former deputy prime minister.Trudeau announced his resignation in January but remains prime minister until a successor is chosen. The new leader is expected to call an early election, with the Conservative Party’s Pierre Poilievre posing a strong challenge. With US-Canada relations strained under Trump, the vote will likely focus on who is best equipped to handle Washington’s economic pressure.Mark Carney, is a former governor of both Canada's central bank and the Bank of England, making him a unique figure in global finance. He is widely credited with helping Canada recover quickly from the 2008 financial crisis, keeping interest rates low and maintaining financial stability.Carney’s ability to communicate complex economic policies in simple terms made him a trusted figure during economic crises. His decision to commit to keeping interest rates low helped maintain public confidence and was later adopted by the US Federal Reserve.Since announcing his leadership bid in January, Carney has received strong endorsements from Cabinet ministers and Liberal MPs, positioning himself as the favourite to lead the party into the next election.Chrystia Freeland, Trudeau’s deputy prime minister, was once seen as a strong contender for Liberal leadership. She played a key role in negotiating trade deals and managing US-Canada relations.However, her close association with the unpopular Trudeau has hurt her chances. She resigned in December after Trudeau removed her as finance minister, releasing a letter critical of his leadership.Carney’s growing support, combined with the Liberal Party’s fear of losing to Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre, has made him the clear frontrunner. Many Liberal MPs see him as the best candidate to challenge Poilievre and counter Trump’s economic threats.","Mark Carney is a former governor of both Canada's central bank and the Bank of England.

But in recent days, Charles has hosted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at his private estate and invited Trump for a historic second state visit.On Monday, Charles will deliver a message for Commonwealth Day , which celebrates the 56-nation club of mostly former British colonies.According to extracts published late on Saturday, Charles -- who heads the Commonwealth -- said nations' differences should be a ""source of strength"".""In these uncertain times, where it is all too easy to believe that our differences are problems instead of a source of strength and an opportunity for learning, the Commonwealth's remarkable collection of nations and peoples come together in the spirit of support and, crucially, friendship.""Earlier on Saturday, British leader Keir Starmer said that Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was considering joining a group of countries prepared to protect an eventual ceasefire in the Russia-Ukraine war .British officials have held talks with around 20 countries interested in being part of the so-called ""coalition of the willing,"" a UK official said on Thursday.The official refused to name the nations but said they were ""largely European and Commonwealth partners"".Charles' message is set to be published in full on Monday.","Britain's King Charles III makes appeal for unity in ""uncertain times"" The 76-year-old monarch emerges as a key figure in the UK's diplomatic drive over Ukraine.

Nasa has postponed the launch of two major space missions, SPHEREx and PUNCH, which were set to lift off aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket on Saturday night from California.“The additional time will allow teams to continue rocket checkouts ahead of liftoff,” according to an update shared by Nasa. “A new launch date will be announced once confirmed on the range,” it said.SPHEREx will scan the entire sky in infrared light, uncovering secrets about galaxies and cosmic history, while PUNCH will study the sun's outer atmosphere and solar wind.SPHEREx, short for Spectro-Photometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization and Ices Explorer, is a space telescope that will survey the entire sky in 102 colours of infrared light. It will capture about 600 images per day, studying millions of stars and galaxies. Scientists will use the data to track how galaxies have evolved over time, identify frozen water and other essential elements across the Milky Way, and create a three-dimensional map of galaxies to help researchers understand cosmic inflation after the Big Bang.PUNCH, or Polarimeter to Unify the Corona and Heliosphere, is a set of four suitcase-sized satellites designed to study the sun’s outer atmosphere, known as the corona, and the solar wind. One satellite will take detailed images of the sun’s corona, while the other three will track solar wind and coronal mass ejections—massive solar eruptions that can impact Earth’s power grids and satellites. By analysing polarised light, PUNCH will map the movement of solar particles and help improve space weather predictions.","Nasa has postponed the launch of two major space missions.

Registration period: March 7–24, 2025

Registration fee: $215 per beneficiary

Selection process: Random selection of unique beneficiaries, not registrations

Notification deadline: March 31, 2025

Step-by-step process for employers and applicants

Employers register beneficiaries online via the USCIS portal. USCIS selects unique beneficiaries through its new system. Selected beneficiaries receive notifications via their USCIS accounts. Employers file H-1B cap-subject petitions for selected candidates.

India’s dominance in the H-1B landscape

Trump’s return: A policy shake-up ahead?

Foreign professionals eyeing a career in the US are already preparing for the 2026 H-1B visa season, with registrations open from March 7 to March 24, 2025. The US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) will continue using a beneficiary-centric selection process, aimed at preventing system manipulation by considering each beneficiary only once, regardless of multiple employer registrations.This system overhaul has significantly reduced the number of registrations. In FY 2025, USCIS received 470,342 eligible registrations—down 38.6% from the 758,994 in FY 2024. The average registrations per beneficiary also dropped from 1.70 to 1.06, indicating reduced duplicate filings.The H-1B visa remains a critical pathway for Indian professionals. In FY 2023, Indian workers received 72.3% of all H-1B visas, while 28% of international student jobs in the US went to Indian graduates.Currently, the US issues 65,000 H-1B visas annually under the general cap, plus 20,000 additional visas for advanced degree holders from US institutions.With Donald Trump back in the White House, international workers and students could see major shifts in immigration policies. His administration may tighten H-1B rules, impose new visa restrictions, and modify the Optional Practical Training (OPT) program, which allows students to work after graduation.However, Trump has also proposed a Gold Card initiative, designed to help US companies retain top foreign talent from elite American universities—a move that could benefit high-skilled workers in critical industries.As the 2026 H-1B visa process kicks off, foreign professionals and employers are bracing for both opportunities and challenges in the evolving US immigration landscape.","The 2026 H-1B visa season is open from March 7 to March 24, 2025.

Who is Mark Carney?

Following his tenure as Britain's central bank chief from 2013 to 2020, Carney will take over from 59-year-old Trudeau, who announced his resignation in January amidst pressure from fellow party members.

Currently serving as chairman of Brookfield Asset Management, a Canadian alternative investment firm, 59-year-old Carney must schedule a general election before or on October 20.

His historic appointment as Bank of England governor in 2013 marked the first time a non-citizen led the institution since its establishment in 1694. He guided the UK economy through Brexit and the early pandemic response, before Andrew Bailey assumed leadership in March 2020.

Post his central bank role, Carney has maintained various financial sector positions and served as an adviser to Trudeau.

Mark Carney , who has been selected as Canada 's next prime minister after Justin Trudeau announced his resignation, said that US President Donald Trump is attacking Canadian workers , and families, and Ottawa cannot let him succeed.Responding to Trump’s trade war and his talk of making Canada the 51st US state, Carney on Sunday said Ottawa will never be part of America in any way.Following his victory announcement, introduced by his daughter Cleo, Carney said, “We have made this the greatest country in the world and now our neighbours want to take us. No way.” He also said Americans “want our resources, water, our land, our country.""Carney asked people to imagine the consequences if Trump take over Canada, ""America is a melting pot. Canada is a mosaic.""""Donald Trump, as we know, has put, as the prime minister just said, unjustified tariffs on what we build, on what we sell, on how we make a living. He's attacking Canadian families, workers and businesses, and we cannot let him succeed. And we won't. We won't. I am proud. I am proud of the response of Canadians who are making their voices heard and their wallets felt. I am grateful for how our provinces are stepping up to the fight,"" Carney said.“America is not Canada. Canada will never ever be part of America in any way, shape or form.""Carney had earlier gained attention for comparing Donald Trump to ""Voldemort"", the villain in the Harry Potter films and books.Speaking at an event amid Trump making statements on making Canada the 51st US state, Carney said, ""When you think about what's at stake in these ridiculous, insulting comments of the president, of what we could be, I view this as the sort of Voldemort of comments.""""Like I will not even repeat it, but you know what I'm talking about,"" he said last month.","Carney will take over from Justin Trudeau, who announced his resignation in January.

Trump Doesn’t Rule Out Recession, Suggests a ‘Period of Transition’ | WSJ News

US President Donald Trump on Sunday refused to say whether the United States will enter a recession this year, offering vague reassurances when pressed on the issue.""I hate to predict things like that,"" he told a Fox News interviewer when asked if a recession was coming in 2025. ""There is a period of transition, because what we're doing is very big — we're bringing wealth back to America,"" he said. ""It takes a little time.""Trump’s commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, was more confident in dismissing concerns. ""Absolutely not,"" he told NBC when asked if Americans should prepare for an economic downturn.Despite these claims, economic warning signs are mounting. The stock market just ended its worst week since the November election. Consumer confidence has dropped, as shoppers worry about rising prices caused by Trump’s shifting tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China.Adding to the uncertainty, mass layoffs continue across government agencies, with billionaire advisor Elon Musk overseeing widespread job cuts.When reporters later asked Trump again about the risk of a recession, he gave a noncommittal answer aboard Air Force One: ""Who knows?""Economic indicators are raising alarms. The Atlanta Federal Reserve now predicts a 2.4% contraction in GDP growth for the first quarter of 2025, which would be the worst performance since the COVID-19 pandemic.Kevin Hassett, Trump's chief economic advisor, suggested on ABC that tariffs might become permanent. He explained that their duration depends on how the targeted countries respond. If they fail to meet US demands, the tariffs could remain in place as part of a new economic equilibrium, he said.In his State of the Union speech, Trump told Americans to expect ""a little disturbance"" as tariffs take effect. ""We're okay with that. It won't be much,"" he insisted.However, economic experts remain cautious. Goldman Sachs raised its estimate of a US recession in the next 12 months from 15% to 20%. Morgan Stanley also predicted weaker growth than expected.A recession is typically defined as two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth. The last US recession occurred in early 2020 during the COVID-19 crisis, when millions lost jobs.",US President Donald Trump refused to say whether the United States will enter a recession this year.

'No power to fire people': US Republican Senators on Elon Musk's role in Trump administration,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/no-power-to-fire-people-us-republican-senators-on-elon-musks-role-in-trump-administration/articleshow/118825003.cms,"Rick Scott Defends DOGE Cuts But Says Elon Musk 'Does Not Have The Power To Fire People'

Trump made clear ‘Elon Musk is your partner’ in Cabinet meeting, says Commerce secretary

Two senior Republicans reinforced US President Donald Trump 's recent stance on Elon Musk ’s influence, emphasising that the Department of Government Efficiency cannot override Cabinet officials or dismiss federal employees, stating that, ""he is a partner and has no power to fire people.""“Elon Musk does not have the power to fire people,” Republican Senator Rick Scott of Florida said Sunday in an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper. “The president of the United States is Donald Trump, and the agency heads are the ones who manage each of their departments,” he added.Scott's remarks followed a tense Cabinet meeting where administration officials voiced concerns about Musk's interference in staffing and policy decisions within their agencies.Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy subsequently described the meeting as ""productive"" in a post to X on Friday, whilst indicating his broader concerns about Musk's agenda to restructure federal bureaucracy.“The President’s approach of a scalpel versus a hatchet and better coordination between Secretaries and DOGE is the right approach to revolutionizing the way our government is run,” Duffy said, Politico reported.During the meeting, Trump instructed his Cabinet officials that Musk lacks authority to make staffing and policy decisions—marking Trump's first significant limitation on Musk's authority. Trump clarified that DOGE's role is advisory, with Cabinet officials retaining final authority over staffing, policies and implementation.Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick , another GOP official, acknowledged DOGE's contributions during a Sunday interview on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" with Kristen Welker. When questioned about agency leadership, Lutnick characterised Musk as his ""partner.""“Elon Musk is your partner,” he said. “He’s your partner in technology, he’s your partner in thought, he’s your partner in doing. What President Trump made clear, is that Elon is your partner. That is what we like,” he added.Trump's revised guidelines for DOGE follow Musk's initiatives for extensive redundancies and proposals to eliminate numerous government agencies, causing distress amongst federal employees.Despite DOGE's controversial actions, Lutnick indicated Cabinet officials remain united in collaborating with Musk to reduce government expenditure. “You have the best technologist and richest guy in the world saying ‘I’ll help you,’ come on, we want his help,” Lutnick concluded.","GOP Senator Rick Scott says 'Elon Musk does not have the power to fire people' Scott's remarks follow a tense Cabinet meeting where administration officials voiced concerns about Musk's interference in staffing and policy decisions within their agencies.

According to Ellis County Justice of the Peace Chris Macon's statement to The Dallas Morning News, Bailey's wife and two sons were also in the RV during the incident.

Trump commented about Zelenskyy. ""He took money out of this country, under Biden, like candy from a baby. It was so easy,"" Trump stated during his Sunday interview with Maria Bartiromo on Fox News.""With that same attitude. I just don’t think he’s grateful. We gave him 350 billion and he is talking about the fact that they have fought and they have this bravery,"" Trump added.The Republican president further emphasised his role in providing Javelin anti-tank weapons to Ukraine, asserting that the ongoing conflict would have been prevented had he been in office when it commenced in 2022.""All he (Zelenskyy) had to do is say (to Europe), you got to stay even with us (the US) ... We're not in danger, they (Europe) are ...So they're paying all this money to Russia, and we're in there for $350 billion,"" he explained.Previously, Trump had ordered a pause on all military aid to Ukraine, escalating tensions between Washington and Kyiv just days after a heated Oval Office confrontation with Zelenskyy.The move effectively halts the delivery of billions in US weaponry, leaving Ukraine uncertain about its ability to sustain its defense against Russia.When Bartiromo questioned Trump about abandoning Zelenskyy before finalising a minerals agreement, asking: ""Are you comfortable with that, the fact you walked away and Ukraine may not survive?""Trump responded: ""Well, it may not survive anyway. But, you know, we have some weaknesses with Russia. You know, it takes two.""She pressed further: ""So is there anything else you want to say to the critics who say you chose a side in the Ukraine-Russia story – and that's Russia.

'Things definitely went a bit cool in Washington after Sandringham'



King Charles' message of unity in 'uncertain times'



The photo of Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy standing shoulder to shoulder with King Charles soon after Zelenskyy's public fallout with Donald Trump in the White House peeved Trump so much that he does not feel the same about Britain. Trump was extended a state visit to Britain presented by UK PM Keir Starmer but after the bonhomie between the monarch and Zelenskyy, Trump feels less special about the invitation. According to a DailyMail report, the feelings have not been kept a secret as Trump allies conveyed Trump's displeasure to the UK officials in America but they were told that no one directs the King.President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance fought with Zelenskyy on television as Vance accused Zelenskyy of not being grateful enough for all that te US has been doing to resolve the war. After Zelenskyy's humiliation, many European leaders supported Zelenskyy. Zelenskyy's meeting with King Charles was scheduled at the same time. And to 'hurt' Trump some more, outgoing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau too met King Charles.Daily Mail reported that 10 Downing Street sources did not 'recognize' the claims that Trump was sulking over King Charles meeting Zelenskyy and Trudeau but citing a well-placed source, it reported: ""Things definitely went a bit cool in Washington after Sandringham. We told them that the King makes his own decisions about who he meets.""Sandringham is King Charles's Norfolk home where Zelenskyy met the monarch.No 10 sources, according to the report, denied any tension between the UK and the US following King Charles' meeting with Zelenskyy and said the PM spoke to Trump on Monday and there has been positive engagement -- Trump likes to call Starmer directly on his mobile phone.King Charles will deliver a message for Commonwealth Day on Monday. According to the extracts of the speech published Saturday, the king would deliver a message of unity. ""In these uncertain times, where it is all too easy to believe that our differences are problems instead of a source of strength and an opportunity for learning, the Commonwealth's remarkable collection of nations and peoples come together in the spirit of support and, crucially, friendship,"" the message reads.","Donald Trump was reportedly sulking as Volodymyr Zelenskyy was warmly greeted by King Charles.

DHS employees face lie detector tests as agency seeks to root out media leaks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/dhs-employees-face-lie-detector-tests-as-agency-seeks-to-root-out-media-leaks/articleshow/118816579.cms,"AP photo

US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has launched an aggressive crackdown on media leaks by making employees take polygraph tests.DHS Secretary Kristi Noem ordered that all future lie detector tests within the department must include questions about unauthorised communication with the media and nonprofit groups. The directive, first reported by Bloomberg Government, is part of a larger effort to stop leaks that expose sensitive operations.“The Department of Homeland Security is a national security agency,” DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said. “We can, should, and will polygraph personnel.”Customs and Border Protection (CBP), a DHS agency, already uses polygraph tests for new hires, but expanding them to existing employees signals a major shift.Noem and President Trump’s Border Czar, Tom Homan, blame leaks for immigration raids being compromised and a drop in arrests by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).“Their job is dangerous enough. So we are going to address this very seriously,” Homan said in early February.On Friday, Noem announced in a video on X that DHS has already found two “criminal leakers.” She said they will be referred to the Department of Justice (DOJ) for “felony prosecutions,” warning they could face up to 10 years in prison.“We will find and root out all leakers. They will face prison time & we will get justice for the American people,” Noem declared.","DHS Secretary Kristi Noem ordered that all future lie detector tests within the department must include questions about unauthorised communication with the media and nonprofit groups.

Detective Melissa Mercado , a seven-year New York Police Department veteran, has been removed from active investigations in the Special Victims Division after she featured in a rap video that went viral. Her participation in the video, which some critics say is degrading to women, has sparked controversy within the department.Mercado’s involvement in the “Doin that” music video by rapper S-Quire is now under review, according to an NYPD spokeswoman, reported New York Post. While the department has not confirmed if she broke any specific rules, her appearance in the video has raised concerns about professionalism and the image of law enforcement.According to Pitch Perfect, the director of the video, Mercado was hired through a casting agency, and neither he nor the rapper knew she was a detective. “None of us were aware of her main profession,” he told TMZ.Mercado, who earns $144,000 a year as a third-grade detective, was not identified as an NYPD officer in the video. She did not wear anything that linked her to the department. However, some within law enforcement found her involvement inappropriate, given her role in investigating sex crimes.Retired officer and lawyer Eric Sanders said Mercado’s participation in the video goes against the values of policing. “She should be disciplined,” he stated. “Police work is a noble profession, and it’s supposed to look a certain way.”Despite the backlash, Pitch Perfect claims she has received multiple offers to feature in other rap videos since her debut in S-Quire’s song. “I’ve had tons of artists reach out trying to get her in their video,” Pitch Perfect added, laughing, “If you look at it like that, it might be a great thing for her. I think she wins.”By Saturday, the “Doin that” video had racked up over 1.6 million views on WorldStarHipHop.","Detective Melissa Mercado has been removed from active investigations in the Special Victims Division after she featured in a rap video.

Peshawar Shooting Incident: Pakistani man kills WhatsApp group admin in anger after being removed from chat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistani-man-kills-whatsapp-group-admin-in-anger-after-being-removed-from-chat/articleshow/118803475.cms,"-

A man in Pakistan has been charged with murder after allegedly shooting the admin of a community WhatsApp group who removed him from the chat, police said on Saturday.The shooting took place on Thursday evening in Regi, a locality on the outskirts of Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, which borders Afghanistan and has a history of sectarian violence .According to police records and a local official, the suspect, identified as Ashfaq Khan, has been charged with the murder of Mushtaq Ahmed. The dispute began when Mushtaq removed Ashfaq from the WhatsApp group following an argument. Hoping to reconcile, both men agreed to meet, but Ashfaq allegedly arrived with a gun and opened fire, killing Mushtaq on the spot.The police report noted that both men were in the process of reconciliation when the suspect suddenly opened fire. The motive behind the attack was “in reaction to removal from WhatsApp group,” as stated in the report.Humayun Khan, the victim’s brother, told Arab News that he was present at the scene but was unaware of the nature of the dispute.“My slain brother Mushtaq and Ashfaq had developed some differences in a WhatsApp group, forcing my brother to remove the latter. Ashfaq got infuriated and shot my brother dead,” he said. “It was a non-issue or a very trivial matter. No one in our family even knew about the dispute at all.”Local police officer Abid Khan confirmed that Humayun had filed a complaint against Ashfaq, who fled the scene after the attack. Authorities are conducting raids to apprehend him.The incident has triggered widespread reactions on social media, with many expressing sorrow over such violence during the holy fasting month of Ramadan.Easy access to firearms, the influence of tribal customs, and weak law enforcement in the region often contribute to minor disputes spiralling into deadly confrontations.","A man in Pakistan has been charged with murder after allegedly shooting the admin of a community WhatsApp group who removed him from the chat.

KARACHI: Six members of the minority Ahmadi community were arrested by police on Saturday after it earlier provided protective custody to around two dozen of them following threats from a sectarian politico-religious party. The police registered cases against the Ahmadi community members after taking them into protective custody when Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) activists gathered outside their place of worship in Surjani town of Karachi to prevent them from offering ""Friday prayers"".""Today, we arrested six people on the complaint of a TLP activist in Surjani,"" a senior police official said.The approximately 500,000-member Ahmadi community in Pakistan is a religious minority which claims itself as Muslims but was officially declared ""non-Muslim"" in 1974 through an amendment in the constitution.They have faced prosecution from right-wing religious parties notably in the Punjab province in recent times.Amir Mahmood, a community spokesperson, said TLP activists had gathered outside their place of worship since Friday afternoon and threatened to tear it down.DIG West, Irfan Baloch, said the TLP activists demanded the arrest of Ahmadi community leaders and the sealing of their place of worship.Ahmadis have generally done their religious rites inside closed buildings to avoid trouble as their worship places have been destroyed and damaged by right-wing religious protesters in the past.Mahmood said detaining Ahmadis from their place of worship for performing their rituals ""was a grave violation of human rights and Pakistan's Constitution"".DIG Baloch said the police would get a ""legal opinion"" about the place of worship as it was a sensitive matter.The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) said on Tuesday it observed a growing trend of mob-led attacks on the homes of families belonging to religious minorities and their places of worship.The HRCP in a report also mentioned the ""arbitrary"" detention of Ahmadis, the alleged desecration of their graves, and the vulnerability of Hindu and Christian women to forced conversion.The HRCP in its report ""Under Siege: Freedom of Religion or Belief in 2023-24"" said about 750 persons were in prison on charges of blasphemy as of October last year.It documented at least four faith-based killings, three of which targeted the Ahmadiyya community.","Ahmadis have generally done their religious rites inside closed buildings to avoid trouble.

ISLAMABAD: Anguished cries of mourners preparing to bury their dead pierced an uneasy calm in Bannu cantonment of Pakistan's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on Wednesday, a day after 13 civilians and five soldiers were killed in a burst of mayhem caused by militants ramming two explosives-laden vehicles into a wall of the army compound.Seven of the civilian casualties in the violence late Tuesday were children while five were women. Jaish al-Fursan, a militant group linked to Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, claimed responsibility for the attack and declared that dozens of soldiers were killed.The army said its prompt response to the militant incursion into the cantonment city helped thwart what could have been a suicide attack with far more devastating consequences. All 16 militants involved in the raid were killed, taking the casualties to 34, the military's media wing said.Schools and shops in Bannu city didn't open the morning after and remained shut throughout the day, reflecting that gloom that descended in the area, adjacent to the restive North Waziristan tribal district bordering Afghanistan. This was the second militant attack on the cantonment within a year and the third within Pakistan since the start of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan last Sunday.In a statement shared on social media, Jaish al-Fursan said the blasts were triggered through explosives-laden vehicles.Official sources said the militant raiders blew up the vehicles at the gate after they were intercepted by security personnel stationed at the entrance. The attack started at 6.30pm, minutes after iftar (break in fasting), and was followed by an unspecified number of militants trying to infiltrate the camp. This resulted in a gunfight that continued till the last of the militants were killed.Over a dozen people were buried in the debris of walls and roofs of multiple houses destroyed by the explosions. A mosque next to the cantonment's entrance also collapsed, trapping a number of worshippers in the rubble. They were pulled out of the debris after the fighting ended.A few days earlier, a suicide bomber killed six people at an Islamic religious school in Akora Khattak town of the same province. Several Taliban leaders graduated from this school, infamous as the ""university of jihad"".Last year was the deadliest in a decade for Pakistan, with a surge in attacks in which over 1,600 lives were lost, according to official data.Islamabad accuses Kabul of failing to root out fighters sheltering on its soil and preparing to mount assaults on Pakistan, a charge the Taliban govt stoutly denies.Jaish al-Fursan is headed by Hafiz Gul Bahadur, a commander of what used to be regarded as the ""good Taliban"".","Jaish al-Fursan, a militant group linked to Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, claimed responsibility for the attack.

ISLAMABAD: US President Donald Trump's announcement to Congress late Tuesday about the capture of most-wanted terrorist Mohammad Sharifulla – mastermind of the 2021 Abbey Gate bombing outside Kabul airport that killed 13 American military service personnel and 170-odd Afghans – came with a surprise pat on Pakistan's back for its role in the operation.""Tonight, I am pleased to announce that we have just apprehended the top terrorist responsible for that atrocity, and he is on his way here to face the swift sword of American justice,"" Trump said in his first address to Congress since returning to the White House for a second term.""I want to thank especially the govt of Pakistan for helping arrest this monster,"" he said of the prolonged search culminating in forces tracing Sharifulla to a hideout on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.According to US media reports, CIA and Pakistani intelligence worked closely to find Sharifulla, whom Pakistan described as a ""top-tier operational commander"" of the proscribed Islamic State-Khorasan Province (IS-KP). The terrorist outfit had claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing that followed the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan that year.Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif was quick to highlight what his govt sees as an opportunity to regain the US's faith as a strategic partner following years of friction, notably after America's exit from Afghanistan and Washington’s growing closeness with India.Within the country, it gives the Sharif govt an advantage over former PM Imran Khan's Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), whose Pakistani-American supporters in the US had campaigned for Trump in the 2024 presidential election. They would possibly be disappointed by Trump's speech to Congress, which included no reference to Imran, PTI or Pakistan's democratic process.Sharif separately announced Sharifullah's arrest through a post on X. ""We thank US President Donald Trump for acknowledging and appreciating Pakistan's role and support in counter terrorism efforts across the region,"" he wrote.""As is well-known, Pakistan has always played a critical role in counter terrorism efforts aimed at denying safe havens to terrorists and militant groups the space to operate against any other country.""In neighbouring India, the reference to ""any other country"" could well spark a debate for a different reason.",US President Donald Trump announced the capture of most-wanted terrorist Mohammad Sharifulla.

The big picture



Renewed counterterrorism cooperation: A Pakistani security official told Reuters that Pakistan’s assistance in the arrest stemmed from “excellent cooperation” between Islamabad and Trump’s new administration. This marks a shift from recent years, where US-Pakistan security collaboration had diminished following the Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan.

A Pakistani security official told Reuters that Pakistan’s assistance in the arrest stemmed from “excellent cooperation” between Islamabad and Trump’s new administration. This marks a shift from recent years, where US-Pakistan security collaboration had diminished following the Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan. Regional security concerns: The Islamic State Khorasan, IS’s regional affiliate, has been linked to several high-profile international attacks, including the March 2024 Moscow concert hall bombing that killed over 140 people and the deadly attack in Iran last year. The Kabul airport bombing was one of its most infamous acts, underscoring the group's capability to carry out large-scale terror operations.

The Kabul airport bombing was one of its most infamous acts, underscoring the group's capability to carry out large-scale terror operations. Pakistan’s domestic threats: IS-K has expanded its reach beyond Afghanistan, increasingly targeting Pakistani cities and security forces. Meanwhile, the TTP has launched numerous deadly attacks in Pakistan’s tribal regions. The government has struggled to contain these threats, making counterterrorism cooperation with the US a strategic necessity.

Between the lines



What’s next



US-Pakistan relations: If this counterterrorism cooperation continues, it could lead to a thaw in relations between the two countries, potentially reviving security assistance programs that had been cut in recent years. The US may also push Pakistan to do more against militant safe havens within its borders.

The arrest of Sharifullah may disrupt IS-K’s operational capabilities in the short term, but the group remains a potent threat. Pakistan will need to step up intelligence-sharing and military operations to prevent retaliatory attacks from IS-K and TTP. Broader implications for Afghanistan: This arrest further highlights Afghanistan’s growing role as a sanctuary for international terrorist networks. The Taliban’s ability (or unwillingness) to suppress IS-K will be a key issue for regional stability.

Pakistani security forces played a crucial role in capturing Mohammad Sharifullah , a top commander of the Islamic State Khorasan (IS-K), who was allegedly responsible for the devastating suicide bombing outside Kabul airport in August 2021. The attack, which occurred during the chaotic US withdrawal from Afghanistan, killed 13 US service members and 170 Afghan civilians.President Donald Trump, in his first address to Congress since his return to the White House, announced that Pakistan had helped arrest “the top terrorist responsible for that atrocity.” While he did not provide details about the operation, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif later confirmed that Sharifullah was apprehended in a counterterrorism raid along the Pakistan-Afghan border.Pakistan’s involvement in this high-profile counterterrorism operation could significantly reshape its relationship with the US.By assisting in Sharifullah’s arrest, Pakistan is signaling its willingness to re-engage with Washington on security matters.This move comes as Pakistan faces increasing pressure from militant groups, including IS-K and the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which have intensified attacks within the country.The operation could help Islamabad gain favor with the US, potentially unlocking military and economic assistance at a time when Pakistan is grappling with financial instability.Pakistan’s decision to assist in Sharifullah’s arrest is not just about counterterrorism—it is also about geopolitics. The country’s strategic importance has waned since the US and Nato withdrawal from Afghanistan, but this operation could help Islamabad regain relevance in Washington’s security calculus.South Asia expert Michael Kugelman noted that Pakistan is trying to “leverage US concerns about terror in Afghanistan and pitch a renewed security partnership.”At the same time, Pakistan’s cooperation might be seen as a balancing act. Islamabad has maintained complex ties with the Afghan Taliban, and it remains to be seen how Kabul will react to this development.The US justice department has charged Sharifullah with ""providing and conspiring to provide material support and resources"" to the group.""He confessed. This was the planner of that bombing,"" White House national security adviser Mike Waltz said in an interview with Fox News.FBI director Kash Patel said Sharifullah was in US custody, in a post on X alongside a picture of agents standing in front of the plane that he was due to arrive on.""That time you delivered the sword of justice for the American people- thank you for your incredible leadership @AGPamBondi and @JohnRatcliffe.

Trump's Rare Praise For Pakistan; Big Reveal On Killing Of 13 US Troops In 2021 Kabul Attack

US President Donald Trump in his first address to Congress mentioned Pakistan's cooperation in arresting Mohammad Shareefullah , a key terrorist involved in the 2021 Kabul airport bombing.

'English in taste'

'Language of learning'

""Dram"", meaning a measure of whisky. ""Turm"", describing a cavalry unit. ""Taupie"", a foolish youngster.Not words in a typical teen's vocabulary, but all come easily to Pakistani prodigy Bilal Asher , world under-14 Scrabble champion.Despite a musty reputation, the word-spelling game has a cult youth following in Pakistan, a legacy of the English languageimposed by Britain's empire but which the country has adapted into its own dialect since independence.In the eccentric field of competitive Scrabble, Pakistan's youngsters reign supreme -- boasting the current youth world champion and more past victors than any other nation since the tournament debuted in 2006.""It requires a lot of hard work and determination,"" said 13-year-old Asher after vanquishing a grey-bearded opponent.""You have to trust the process for a very long time, and then gradually it will show the results.""Karachi, a megacity shrugging off its old definition as a den of violent crime, is Pakistan's incubator for talent in Scrabble -- where players spell words linked like a crossword with random lettered tiles.Schools in the southern port metropolis organise tutorials with professional Scrabble coaches and grant scholarships to top players, while parents push their kids to become virtuosos.""They inculcate you in this game,"" said Asher, one of around 100 players thronging a hotel function room for a Pakistan Scrabble Association (PSA) event as most of the city dozed through a Sunday morning.Daunters (meaning intimidating people), imarets (inns for pilgrims) and trienes (chemical compounds containing three double bonds) are spelled out by ranks of seated opponents.Some are so young their feet don't touch the ground, as they use chess clocks to time their turns.""They're so interested because the parents are interested,"" said 16-year-old Affan Salman, who became the world youth Scrabble champion in Sri Lanka last year.""They want their children to do productive things -- Scrabble is a productive game.""English was foisted onthe Indian subcontinent by Britain's colonialism and an 1835 order from London started to systematise it as the main language of education.The plan's architect, Thomas Macaulay, said the aim was to produce ""a class of persons, Indian in blood and colour, but English in taste, in opinions, in morals and in intellect.""It was instrumental in creating a colonial civil service to rule for Britain according to Kaleem Raza Khan, who teaches English at Karachi's Salim Habib University.""They started teaching English because they wanted to create a class of people, Indian people, who would be in the middle of the people and the rulers,"" said Khan, whose wife and daughter are Scrabble devotees.British rule ended in the bloody partition of 1947 creating India and Pakistan.Today there are upwards of 70 languages spoken in Pakistan, but English remains an official state language alongside the lingua franca Urdu, and they mingle in daily usage.Schools often still teach English with verbose colonial-era textbooks.""The adaptation of English as the main language is definitely a relation to the colonial era,"" said PSA youth programme director Tariq Pervez. ""That is our main link.""The English of Pakistani officialdom remains steeped in anachronistic words.The prime minister describes militant attacks as ""dastardly"", state media dubs protesters ""miscreants"" and the military denounces its ""nefarious"" adversaries.Becoming fluent in the loquacious lingo of Pakistani English remains aspirational because of its association to the upper echelons of society.In Pakistan more than a third of children between the ages of five and 16 are out of school -- a total of nearly 26 million, according to the 2023 census.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif declared an ""education emergency"" last year to address the stark figures.""People are interested in Scrabble because they can get opportunities for scholarships in universities or for jobs because it provides the vocab,"" said Asher's sister Manaal.But the 14-year-old reigning female number one in Pakistan warned: ""You've got to be resilient otherwise Scrabble isn't right for you.""In the Karachi hotel, Scrabble -- invented in the 1930s during America's Great Depression by an unemployed architect -- is an informal training programme for success in later life.""The main language of learning is English,"" said Pervez.""This game has a great pull,"" he added. ""The demand is so big. So many kids want to play, we don't have enough resources to accommodate all of them.""At the youngest level the vocabulary of the players is more rudimentary: toy, tiger, jar, oink.But professional Scrabble coach Waseem Khatri earns 250,000 rupees ($880) a month -- nearly seven times the minimum wage -- coaching some 6,000 students across Karachi's school system to up their game.In Pakistani English parlance ""they try to express things in a more beautiful way -- in a long way to express their feelings,"" said 36-year-old Khatri.""We try to utilise those words also in Scrabble.""But when Asher wins he is overwhelmed with joy, and those long words don't come so easily.""I cannot describe the feeling,"" he said.",Pakistani youngsters reign supreme in the eccentric field of competitive Scrabble.

Talks start on Pakistan’s $7 billion IMF bailout review,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/talks-start-on-pakistans-7billion-imf-bailout-review/articleshow/118717323.cms,"IMF

ISLAMABAD: Formal talks between cash-strapped Pakistan and International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) for the first biannual review of a $7-billion bailout programme kicked off Tuesday in Islamabad.Pakistan and IMF had reached a three-year $7 billion aid package deal in July, with the new programme set to allow the country to “cement macroeconomic stability and create conditions for stronger, more inclusive and resilient growth”. As part of the deal, Islamabad had agreed to a number of unpopular measures, including increasing the amount of tax it collects from people and businesses.A nine-member team led by IMF mission chief Nathan Porter had landed in Pakistan on Monday to assess the country’s economic performance to determine the release of a $1.1-billion tranche. “They are here. We will have two rounds of talks, first technical and then policy level. I think we are well-positioned for the talks,” finance minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said.During their discussions with Pakistani authorities, the IMF delegation will assess the country’s compliance with quantitative performance criteria, structural benchmarks and indicative targets under the 37-month programme.A senior govt official involved in preparations for the IMF review said there were some technical slippages for certain deadlines. The most critical weakness observed so far had been the revenue shortfall against programme targets, the official added.The ongoing 37-month Extended Fund Facility (EFF) programme consists of six reviews over the life of the bailout, and the release of the next tranche of approximately $1bn will be contingent on the success of the performance review.Just before the mission’s visit, IMF reiterated last week that its programme aimed to raise Pakistan’s woefully low tax-to-GDP ratio by 3%, while improving the fairness and efficiency of the tax system by broadening the tax base and improving tax compliance.According to media reports, IMF has been demanding action against tax evasion in the real estate sector. “During the ongoing talks, the IMF pushed for action against those misdeclaring property values,” a local TV station reported, saying the government had assured the global lender it would activate the Real Estate Regulatory Authority.Pakistan has taken more than 20 loans from the IMF since 1958 and is currently its fifth-largest debtor. For decades, the country has relied on IMF loans to meet its needs and continued to struggle after years of financial mismanagement.In 2023, Pakistan was on the verge of defaulting on its debts and had barely enough in foreign currencies to pay for a month of imports.","Pakistan and IMF had reached a three-year $7 billion aid package deal in July.

ISLAMABAD: At least five people were killed and 20 injured in a suicide blast at a mosque of an Islamic religious school known as the “university of jihad” in Nowshera district of Pakistan’s northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province on Friday.Among the dead were Maulana Hamid-ul-Haq Haqqani , head of Dar-ul-Uloom Haqqania school, the seminary in Nowshera’s Akora Khattak town where key Afghan Taliban leaders have studied. Mullah Omer, the slain founder of the Taliban movement in Afghanistan, was also an alumni of this religious school.Graduates of the seminary include current Afghan Taliban leaders Amir Khan Muttaqi, Sirajuddin Haqqani, Abdul Latif Mansoor, Maulvi Ahmad Jan, Mullah Jalaludin Haqani, Maulvi Qalamudin, Arifullah Arif and Mullah Khairullah Khairkhwa.The explosion occurred in the main prayer hall as people gathered for weekly Friday prayers were leaving the mosque.KP police chief Zulfiqar Hameed confirmed that it was a suicide attack and that three policemen were also injured. “More than a dozen police officers were guarding the mosque when the attack occurred, and Haq’s seminary also had its own security,” he said.“It appears that Hamid Haqqani (seminary’s slain chief) was the target,” Hameed added.Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the attack, which came on the last Friday ahead of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.Yawar Zia, a police constable, who was injured in the attack, said he was on security duty at the seminary when the blast happened and splinters hit him. “After offering prayer, Hamid-ul-Haq, accompanied by his guards, was leaving the mosque when the powerful explosion occurred,” the wounded official said.Eyewitnesses described a chaotic scene, with blood and body parts scattered all over the place.

China has signed an agreement with Pakistan to send a Pakistani astronaut to its space station, Tiangong , marking the first time a foreign national will be aboard the facility.The deal was signed in a ceremony held in Islamabad on Friday, between the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA) and Pakistan’s Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (SUPARCO). Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was alos present during the ceremony.According to a statement by CMSA, both nations will collaborate on selecting and training Pakistani astronauts, with the chosen candidate expected to join Chinese taikonauts for a short-term mission in the coming years.""This signifies a major step in China’s international space cooperation ,"" reported Global Times, highlighting the growing partnership between Beijing and Islamabad in aerospace advancements.China’s space station, which has been operational for nearly four years, was built after the country was reportedly excluded from the International Space Station (ISS) due to concerns over the involvement of China’s military in its space programme.The station is also seen as a new frontier of competition between China and the US.As per the news agency PTI, the agreement further solidifies China’s support for Pakistan’s space ambitions, following previous collaborations such as the launch of Pakistani satellites.Pakistan’s first digital communications satellite, Badr-1, was launched aboard a Chinese Long March 2E rocket in 1990, while earlier this year, Pakistan’s CubeSat accompanied China’s Chang’e-6 probe to the Moon.According to Global Times, the selection of the astronaut is expected to take around a year, after which the candidate will undergo intensive training in China. This move, experts say, demonstrates the reliability of China's manned space technology and its willingness to lower barriers for developing countries to participate in space exploration .China has also set ambitious goals for space exploration, with plans to land astronauts on the Moon before 2030.Meanwhile, the US has its sights set on returning to the lunar surface by 2025.","China has signed an agreement with Pakistan to send a Pakistani astronaut to its space station, Tiangong.

Nepal Monarchy Restoration: Thousands rally in Kathmandu to welcome former king amid calls for return of monarchy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/thousands-rally-in-kathmandu-to-welcome-former-king-amid-calls-for-return-of-monarchy/articleshow/118821430.cms,"Thousands rally in Kathmandu to welcome former king amid calls for return of monarchy (Picture credit: PTI)

Nepal’s former King Gyanendra Shah was greeted with the chants of ""come king, save the nation"" by thousands of his supporters as he arrived in Kathmandu on Sunday, amid growing calls for the reinstatement of the monarchy and Nepal’s status as a Hindu state.According to the news agency AFP, Shah’s supporters waved Nepal’s flag and chanted slogans like ""Come king, save the nation!"" as the 77-year-old former monarch stepped out of Tribhuvan International Airport following a tour of western Nepal.The crowd, which included members of the pro-monarchist Rastriya Prajatantra Party , carried placards reading ""We want our King back"" and ""Abolish federal republican system and reinstate the monarchy.""AP reported that an estimated 10,000 supporters gathered outside the airport, blocking its main entrance. Passengers were forced to walk to and from the airport due to the heavy crowd. Riot police were deployed to prevent demonstrators from entering the premises, but no violence was reported.Nepal abolished its 240-year-old monarchy in 2008 after a decade-long civil war that left over 16,000 dead. However, dissatisfaction with political instability, corruption and economic struggles has fuelled a resurgence of support for the former royal family.“The country faces instability, prices are high, people are jobless, and there is a lack of education and healthcare facilities,” said Rajindra Kunwar, a teacher who joined the rally who was quoted by AFP. “The poor are dying of hunger. The law applies to the public, but not to politicians. That’s why we need the king back”, Kunwar added.Nepal has had 13 different governments since 2008, with growing frustration over governance issues. Some protesters, including those who previously supported the abolition of the monarchy, have now changed their stance. “I was in the protests that took away monarchy, hoping it would help the country, but I was mistaken,” said Kulraj Shrestha, a carpenter. “The nation has further plunged, so I have changed my mind”, Shrestha added.Gyanendra, who has generally remained silent on political matters, has made several public appearances recently. On the eve of Nepal’s Democracy Day last month, he issued a statement saying, ""It is now time. If we wish to save our nation and maintain national unity, I call on all countrymen to support us for Nepal's prosperity and progress.""Despite the rising pro-monarchy sentiment, political analyst Lok Raj Baral told AFP that the monarchy's return is unlikely, stating that it was ""a source of instability."" He added, ""For some disgruntled groups, it has become a retreat due to the incompetence of politicians.""As per PTI, security was heightened in Kathmandu, with dozens of riot policemen deployed around Narayanhiti Palace Museum, the former royal residence. There were rumours that Gyanendra might attempt to enter the palace with his supporters but the former king proceeded to his private residence, Nirmal Niwas, without any incident.The movement for the monarchy’s restoration has been gaining traction since February, when Gyanendra’s Democracy Day statement reignited debate on Nepal’s future political system.Bollywood actress Manisha Koirala, who is the granddaughter of Nepal’s first elected Prime Minister BP Koirala, urged Nepalis on social media to gather at the airport to welcome the former monarch.","Nepal's former King Gyanendra Shah greeted with chants of ""come king, save the nation"" by thousands of his supporters as he arrived in Kathmandu on Sunday.

Can Gyanendra return to power?

Chants of ""Long live our beloved king"" and ""Vacate the royal palace for the king"" echoed through the streets of Kathmandu on Sunday as thousands of supporters of Nepal's former king, Gyanendra Shah , gathered to demand the restoration of the monarchy and Hinduism as the state religion.An estimated 10,000 royalists blocked the main entrance to Tribhuvan International Airport as Gyanendra returned from a tour of western Nepal. Protesters waved flags and carried banners calling for the former king’s reinstatement. The demonstration disrupted airport operations, forcing passengers to walk to and from the terminal, while hundreds of riot police prevented demonstrators from entering the airport. Despite the intensity of the protest, no violence was reported.Nepal abolished its 239-year-old monarchy in 2008, two years after massive street protests forced Gyanendra to step down from absolute rule. The country became a federal democratic republic, but since then, many Nepalis have grown frustrated with political instability and economic struggles.Since the abolition of the monarchy, Nepal has seen 13 different governments, leading many to believe the current system has failed. Corruption, economic hardship, and lack of political stability have left some citizens reconsidering their stance on monarchy.""We are here to give the king our full support and to rally behind him all the way to reinstating him in the royal throne,"" said Thir Bahadur Bhandari, a 72-year-old protester.Kulraj Shrestha, a 50-year-old carpenter, admitted he had initially opposed the monarchy but had since changed his mind. ""I was in the protests that took away monarchy, hoping it would help the country, but I was mistaken. The nation has further plunged, so I have changed my mind,"" he said.Despite the growing support, Gyanendra has not commented on the renewed calls for his return. Political analysts believe his chances of regaining the throne remain slim in the near future. The republic is constitutionally enshrined, and mainstream political parties remain opposed to reinstating the monarchy.Gyanendra, who first became king in 2002 after the tragic massacre of his brother King Birendra and his family, initially ruled as a constitutional monarch. However, in 2005, he seized absolute power, dissolving the government and parliament, jailing politicians and journalists, and imposing emergency rule. His authoritarian rule led to the mass protests that ultimately resulted in the abolition of the monarchy.","Nepal abolished its 239-year-old monarchy in 2008, two years after massive street protests forced Gyanendra to step down from absolute rule.

Ongoing global criticism



International pressure and Taliban's isolation



On International Women's Day, the Taliban issued a statement asserting their commitment to safeguarding the rights of Afghan women.Chief spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid posted on his official X account, stating that the ''Islamic Emirate assumes full responsibility for the provision and safeguarding of the rights of Afghan women.''Without directly referencing International Women's Day, Mujahid said that dignity, honor, and legal rights for women remain a priority for the Taliban government.He claimed that Afghan women ''live in security, both physically and psychologically''and that their ''fundamental rights'' — such as autonomy in marital decisions, dowry entitlements, and inheritance — are protected.The Taliban's statement comes as the United Nations continues to denounce the severe restrictions on Afghan women.Since seizing control in 2021, the Taliban have imposed sweeping bans on education and employment for women. Girls were barred from secondary education, and later, from attending and teaching at Kabul University.In August 2023, the Vice and Virtue Ministry expanded restrictions, prohibiting women's voices in public and mandating full face coverings outside the home.On Saturday, the UN renewed its call for these bans to be lifted. ''The erasure of women and girls from public life cannot be ignored,'' said Roza Otunbayeva, head of the UN mission in Afghanistan.Alison Davidian, special representative for UN Women Afghanistan, added, ""We must stand with Afghan women as if our own lives depend on it — because they do.""Mujahid emphasized distinctions in Afghan and Western notions of women's rights. He said ''Afghan women's rights are situated within the specific context of an Islamic and Afghan society, which exhibits distinct divergences from Western societies and their cultural paradigms.''The Taliban remain globally isolated, with no official recognition as running Afghanistan's government due to their policies on women. In January, the International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor requested arrest warrants for two senior Taliban officials for their role in repressing Afghan women.Last Friday, Unesco hosted a high-level conference on women and girls in Afghanistan, featuring activists, parliamentarians, and rights experts. They included Hamida Aman, founder of the women-only station Radio Begum, former Afghan lawmaker Fawzia Koofi and human rights expert Richard Bennett, who has been barred from entering Afghanistan.In response, Saif ul-Islam Khyber, a spokesman for the Vice and Virtue Ministry, dismissed such gatherings, calling them an ''exposure of the hypocrisy of certain organizations and European Union foundations.''","The Taliban issued a statement asserting their commitment to safeguarding the rights of Afghan women.

Bangladesh sees 'troubling' rise in cases of rape and assault on women,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-sees-troubling-rise-in-cases-of-rape-and-assault-on-women/articleshow/118809920.cms,"Representative image

DHAKA: Chief adviser Muhammad Yunus voiced strong concern over recent reports of attacks on women, calling them ""deeply troubling"" and a clear deviation from the vision of a ""New Bangladesh"" that the nation's people strive for.His comment, made at an International Women's Day event, came in the aftermath of the harrowing plight of an eight-year-old girl who is fighting for her life after being allegedly raped. This case is not an isolated incident but part of a broader, grim trend of sexual violence that has plagued the country. Reports of rape, gang rape, sexual assault and harassment have become disturbingly frequent.Addressing the situation of violence against women in Bangladesh that remained troubling since last year, with shocking numbers reported in the first two months, Fauzia Moslem, president of Bangladesh Mahila Parishad, said, ""Society is descending into chaos, where lawlessness and criminal impunity are growing. The failure of law enforcement, compromises, and lack of accountability are empowering criminals.""A report by the Manabadhikar Shongskriti Foundation (MSF) in Dhaka revealed that Feb 2025 documented 295 incidents of violence against women and children, 24 more than in Jan. It noted that Islamic fundamentalist groups, terrorists, and other extremist elements play a visible role in these incidents.A total of 21 women from various professions told local media that they experienced sexual harassment outside the home in past three months. The women, aged between 19 and 48 and residing in Dhaka, reported multiple instances.According to Dhaka-based human rights organisation Ain o Salish Kendra, in Feb, 46 women were victims of rape, 22 of whom were under 18. In Jan, this number was 39, including 15 minors.(With inputs from ANI)","Chief adviser Muhammad Yunus voiced strong concern over recent reports of attacks on women.

The organisation was termed as a ""terrorist organisation"" by India for trying to ""establish Islamic state and caliphate globally"".The ""March for Khilafat"" was joined by the thousands and the rally began from the north gate of Baitul Mukarram National Mosque in the capital city. The clashes erupted when the police intervened to stop the march, Dhaka Tribune reported.The procession initially proceeded without disruption, but tensions flared as demonstrators moved from Paltan towards Bijoynagar, where police set up a blockade. In response, Hizb ut-Tahrir members resisted, triggering a chase between both sides.To disperse the crowd, police fired tear gas shells and sound grenades, temporarily scattering the demonstrators. However, they later regrouped and attempted to resume their procession. As tensions escalated, law enforcement once again deployed tear gas, while protesters retaliated by hurling bricks and stones at officers. The confrontation intensified, resulting in the arrest of several Hizb ut-Tahrir members, Dhaka Tribune reported.The group remains a banned organization in Bangladesh, with all its activities and demonstrations declared illegal.The march comes amid rising concerns of violence against minorities and recent attacks on cultural, religious, and diplomatic properties in the south Asian nation, as raised by India at several occasions, especially after the ouster of former Bangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina last year.This was reiterated by a UN report released in January which revealed that members of Bangladesh's Hindu, Ahmadiyya Muslim, and indigenous communities faced human rights abuses during the anti-discrimination protests that led to the fall of Sheikh Hasina's government in 204 and its aftermath.It said that even though authorities had reportedly made 100 arrests in connection with the attacks, many perpetrators of revenge violence and targeted assaults continued to enjoy impunity.India declared Hizb ut-Tahrir a terrorist organisation last year and said that the group was ""involved in various acts of terror, including radicalising the gullible youths to join terrorist organisations and raise funds for terror activities, posing a serious threat to the national security and sovereignty of India. The Modi government is committed to securing Bharat by dealing the forces of terror with an iron fist.”“HuT is an organisation which aims to establish Islamic state and caliphate globally, including in India, by overthrowing democratically elected governments through jihad and terrorist activities by involving citizens of the country, which is a grave threat to the democratic setup and internal security of the country,” the ministry of home affairs had said.","Hizb ut-Tahrir held its first open rally in Dhaka on Friday against Bangladeshi administration's orders.

NASA Curiosity rover discovers ancient molecules on Mars



Largest Organics Yet Discovered on Mars

Mars’ Gale Crater and findings



The Curiosity rover, along the lower slopes of Mount Sharp inside Gale Crater, has reportedly uncovered the largest organic molecules ever found on the Red Planet. Decane, undecane, and dodecane are the mid-sized hydrocarbons that look a lot like fragments of fatty acids preserved in mudstone that’s 3.7 billion years old. Scientists reveal these molecules can form both naturally and through life. But the discovery has reignited speculation that Mars might have hosted microbial life long ago.According to NASA, the findings were published in March 2025, describing how prebiotic chemistry has advanced further on Mars than previously what was observed. As cited, NASA, the mudstone samples may be the proof that Mars had life.The rover’s instruments reportedly detected these organics in mudstone samples and found them to be the largest on Mars so far. Scientists noticed they resemble fatty acids, which on Earth are key building blocks for cells. On Mars, though, cosmic radiation tends to destroy such molecules over billions of years. Lab tests and modelling were used to rewind 80 million years of surface exposure. Data seems to make a biological explanation credible, with lead scientists reportedly stressing the need for more experiments simulating Martian conditions.Curiosity’s been at this for over a decade. Launched back in 2012, it’s been exploring ancient lakebeds, rocky outcrops, and now these sulfate-rich layers. The mountain we’re climbing, Mount Sharp, has layers like a giant cake.Gale Crater has been giving up secrets since 2012. From methane plumes to complex organics, the place seems like a goldmine for astrobiologists. These latest molecules might not prove life, but they add a new layer to the puzzle.The findings also set the stage for sample-return missions. Perseverance, another rover on Mars, might help refine the story.","Decane, undecane, and dodecane are the mid-sized hydrocarbons that look a lot like fragments of fatty acids preserved in mudstone that’s 3.7 billion years old.

Kid Rock Or Bad Bunny? Trump’s Preference Shakes Super Bowl Talk

Candace Owens explains why both Bad Bunny and Kid Rock Super Bowl halftime shows failed her





Candace Owens did not pick a side during the 2026 Super Bowl halftime debate. Instead, she rejected both choices in one blunt post that quickly spread online. The political commentator criticized the official halftime show by Bad Bunny and the conservative-backed alternate show led by Kid Rock, saying neither one worked for her. Her main issue was not music style or politics alone. It was what she felt the night had turned into, two loud camps trying to sell identity instead of entertainment. In a post shared on February 8, 2026, Candace Owens said she was tired of the constant left-versus-right framing and called it boring.The Super Bowl featured Bad Bunny’s Spanish-language performance, while Turning Point USA streamed its own “All-American Halftime Show.” Both shows pulled huge attention, but also strong reactions. For Candace Owens, the problem was simple. She said viewers were being pushed to choose a political label instead of just enjoying the game. Her final line summed up her mood: “The left vs. right grift is actually boring now. ”In her post on X, Candace Owens said she “hate[s] both options.” She first pointed to Bad Bunny, saying the official halftime show was presented “without a word of English spoken.”She then turned to the alternate broadcast organized by Turning Point USA, which featured Kid Rock. Candace Owens accused the group of paying advertisers and influencers to make the show look bigger than it was. She claimed the view numbers were pushed to appear record-breaking.Her frustration was not aimed at one side alone. She questioned why entertainment now feels tied to political teams. Ending her post, she asked, “What exactly are we doing here, America?”According to UNILAD, the Turning Point USA event included performances by Brantley Gilbert, Lee Brice, and Gabby Barrett. The show was promoted as a patriotic alternative to the main broadcast.Meanwhile, BBC reported that Bad Bunny became the first artist to perform an entire Super Bowl halftime show in Spanish. His set focused on Puerto Rican culture and unity and included guest appearances by Lady Gaga and Ricky Martin. He ended by saying, “God bless America,” and showed the message, “Together, We Are America.”U.S. President Donald Trump criticized the performance on Truth Social, calling it “absolutely terrible.” The BBC also noted that Bad Bunny avoided direct political messages during the show, despite his past comments on immigration.",The political commentator criticized the official halftime show by Bad Bunny and the conservative-backed alternate show led by Kid Rock.

MOSCOW: Russia said Monday that a gunman who shot and wounded a top Russian military intelligence officer in Moscow last week before fleeing to Dubai was acting on Kyiv's orders. High-ranking general Vladimir Alekseyev was shot several times in his apartment block in Moscow and was hospitalised. There have been a string of assassinations of Russian army officials on Russian soil during Moscow's almost four-year Ukraine offensive.Russia's FSB security service said Russian citizen Lyubomir Korba, born in 1960, shot Alekseyev ""on the orders of Ukraine's SBU"" security services after being recruited and trained in Ukraine.FSB said Korba's son, who lives in Poland, was involved in his recruitment process. Moscow said over the weekend that a Russian man in his 60s was arrested in Dubai and handed over to Russia over the attempted killing. ""On the day of the assassination, Korba got into the building where the military man lived, waited until he appeared in the lift lobby and shot four times.""In a statement, FSB said Korba was recruited in Ukraine's Ternopil last year and sent into Russia through Moldova and Georgia, adding he was promised $30,000 for the killing.It said he acted with two accomplices - naming them as Viktor Vasin and Zinaida Serebritskaya.It accused Vasin of being a supporter of the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. Ukraine has claimed some of the killings in Russia, but has denied being behind the attempt on Alekseyev.

Political support highlights strike





After nearly a month on the picket lines, nurses at two of New York City’s largest hospital systems, Montefiore and Mount Sinai, have reached tentative agreements with management, potentially ending one of the city’s biggest nurse strikes in decades.The walkout, which began on January 12, involved roughly 15,000 nurses demanding safer staffing, better pay, and stronger workplace protections.The three-year agreements now await ratification by nurses at Montefiore, Mount Sinai Hospital, and Mount Sinai Morningside and West. If approved, nurses could return to work as early as Saturday.About 10,500 nurses are covered under the new contracts. NewYork-Presbyterian remains the only major hospital system still in negotiations.According to the New York State Nurses Association, the tentative agreements include:“For four weeks, nearly 15,000 NYSNA members held the line in the cold and snow for safe patient care,” said NYSNA President Nancy Hagans. “Now nurses are heading back to the bedside with their heads held high after winning fair contracts.”Hospital officials said patient care largely continued during the strike, with some elective surgeries postponed and temporary nurses filling in.They also noted that nurses’ average salaries range from $162,000–$165,000, while executives earn multimillion-dollar salaries.The walkout drew attention from New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani and Senator Bernie Sanders, who joined nurses on picket lines. Sanders criticised “greed in the healthcare industry,” while Mamdani emphasised the importance of supporting frontline workers in a city they can live and work in.With contract votes set to begin, the focus now shifts to nurses’ approval. If ratified, the agreements will end a strike that has brought national attention to staffing shortages and workplace safety in American hospitals.","The three-year agreements now await ratification by nurses at Montefiore, Mount Sinai Hospital, and Mount Sinai Morningside and West.

'If you’re watching this...': Iranian records video urging Trump not to make a deal with Tehran before killing himself,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/if-youre-watching-this-iranian-records-video-urging-trump-not-to-make-a-deal-with-tehran-before-killing-himself/articleshow/128129917.cms,"



An Iranian man who recorded a video appeal to US President Donald Trump has taken his own life after urging him not to strike any deal with Iran’s current ruling establishment.Iranian media and activists identified the man as Pouria Hamidi, who was from the southern port city of Bushehr. In a video lasting around 10 minutes and recorded in English, Hamidi said he wanted to bring attention to a violent crackdown on protests in Iran.“If you’re watching this, then I’m not around anymore,” he said at the start of the recording. He claimed the video was meant to make people realise the massacre carried out by Iranian authorities during recent unrest.“More than 40,000 people died, killed, massacred. More than Russia and Ukraine war and more than Israel and Palestine,” Hamidi claimed, without providing evidence for the numbers, reports the Iran Insight.Addressing US leaders directly, he warned against negotiations with Tehran, saying any agreement would “betray all those people who died”.“So please,” he said, “I beg you, do whatever you can to stop this deal.”Hamidi also called for foreign intervention, saying diplomacy had failed. “America attacking the Iran is the only hope we have right now,” he said, adding, “We can't fight this regime alone. Our people need foreign intervention.”The video included criticism of Iran’s religious leadership and expressions of support for exiled Prince Reza Pahlavi. Hamidi said his message was an attempt to give meaning to his life and urged Iranians to support one another.At the end of the recording, he switched to Persian, saying: “We people of Iran are lonely people and have nobody, so please support each other. Long live Iran.”His death comes amid heightened tensions over Iran and the possibility of renewed negotiations with Tehran. Israel, in particular, has voiced concern over any deal that would preserve Iran’s ruling system.According to a report by Israel Hayom, Israeli officials fear that an agreement could leave the ayatollah regime in place, unlock frozen funds and fail to dismantle Iran’s nuclear and missile programmes. The report said Israel remains on high alert, viewing such a deal as potentially worse than a military confrontation.Israeli officials are expected to increase diplomatic and intelligence efforts to persuade Trump that there is a “historic window of opportunity” to curb Iran’s threat. These efforts are also expected to shape Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s planned meeting with Trump in Washington later this week.","Iranian media and activists identified the man as Pouria Hamidi, who was from the southern port city of Bushehr.

Buckingham Palace has pledged to “stand ready to support” UK police if approached over allegations concerning King Charles III’s brother, former Prince Andrew.The King has expressed “profound concern” over claims that Andrew shared confidential reports from his role as the UK’s trade envoy with convicted sex offender and pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.Thames Valley Police confirmed it is assessing suggestions that Andrew disclosed sensitive information to Epstein, according to the Independent.A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: “The King has made clear, in words and through unprecedented actions, his profound concern at allegations which continue to come to light in respect of Mr Mountbatten-Windsor’s conduct. While the specific claims in question are for Mr Mountbatten-Windsor to address, if we are approached by Thames Valley Police we stand ready to support them as you would expect. As was previously stated, Their Majesties’ thoughts and sympathies have been, and remain with, the victims of any and all forms of abuse. ”The Palace has not yet been contacted by police regarding the claims, which relate to Andrew’s time as the UK’s special representative for international trade and investment. The allegations follow a US Department of Justice (DOJ) release of millions of documents linked to Epstein.The Prince and Princess of Wales addressed the scandal publicly for the first time, with Kensington Palace saying they were “deeply concerned” at the “continued revelations” and that their thoughts “remain focused on the victims.”Moreover, Andrew was stripped of his royal titles last year and has denied any wrongdoing. Last week, he moved from Royal Lodge to the King’s private Sandringham estate, with Charles personally funding his new residence through an annual stipend.The new allegations suggest Andrew shared confidential reports with Epstein, including briefings on visits to Hong Kong, Vietnam and Singapore. Emails show Andrew forwarded one report just five minutes after receiving it from his adviser, and another on Christmas Eve 2010 included details of investment opportunities in Afghanistan’s Helmand Province.The revelations have resulted in public criticism. Former BBC royal correspondent Peter Hunt said the King should make Andrew testify before the US Congress and back laws to remove him from the line of succession. He warned that if the King does not act, the monarchy could be seen as failing Epstein’s victims.The Epstein scandal has haunted the royal family in recent weeks, despite King Charles’s previous steps to end Andrew’s public life.

SpaceX prioritises lunar 'self-growing city' over Mars project: Musk,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/spacex-prioritises-lunar-self-growing-city-over-mars-project-musk/articleshow/128134560.cms,"Race with China





Elon Musk has said that SpaceX has shifted its focus to building a ""self-growing city"" on the moon, which could be achieved in less than 10 years.SpaceX still intends to start on Musk's long-held ambition of a city on Mars within five to seven years, he wrote on his X social media platform, ""but the overriding priority is securing the future of civilization and the Moon is faster"".Musk's comments echo a Wall Street Journal report on Friday, which said SpaceX has told investors it would prioritize going to the moon and attempt a trip to Mars at a later time, targeting March 2027 for an uncrewed lunar landing.This marks a shift from Musk's long-standing focus on Mars as SpaceX's primary destination.As recently as last year, he said the company aimed to launch an uncrewed Mars mission by the end of 2026.""No, we're going straight to Mars. The Moon is a distraction,"" he said in Jan last year in response to a post on X.Musk has a long record of setting ambitious timelines for projects such as electric vehicles and self-driving technology that have repeatedly failed to materialise on schedule.The US faces intense competition from China to return humans to the moon this decade. Humans have not visited the lunar surface since the Apollo 17 mission in 1972.Less than a week ago, Musk said that SpaceX acquired the artificial intelligence company he also leads, xAI, in a deal that values the rocket and satellite company at $1 trillion and the AI outfit at $250 billion.Proponents of the move view it as a way for SpaceX to bolster its plans for space-based data centres, which Musk sees as more energy efficient than terrestrial facilities as the demand for compute power soars with AI development.SpaceX is hoping a public offering later this year could raise as much as $50 billion, which could make it the largest public offering in history.On Monday, Musk said in response to a user on X that Nasa will constitute less than 5% of SpaceX's revenue this year.SpaceX is a core contractor in Nasa's Artemis moon programme with a $4 billion contract to land astronauts on the lunar surface using Starship.""Vast majority of SpaceX revenue is the commercial Starlink system,"" Musk said. On Sunday, Musk shared the company's first Super Bowl ad, promoting its Starlink Wi-Fi service. Even as Musk reorients SpaceX, he is also pushing his publicly traded company, Tesla, in a new direction. After virtually building the global EV market, Tesla is planning to spend $20 billion this year as part of an effort to pivot to autonomous driving and robots.To speed up the shift, Musk said Jan Tesla is ending production of two car models at its California factory to make room for manufacturing its Optimus humanoid robots.

Ujjwal Chadha, an Indian-origin AI Engineering Lead, has left his job as a Developer at Microsoft in the United States and returned to India for a remote role. He shared on X that the move has changed his life.Chadha mentioned the ""PPP"" advantage, saying that $250,000 is comfortable in Seattle, but it goes a long way in Delhi. His rent dropped by 80 per cent, and his savings rate rose to 90 per cent.He also pointed out the ""Time Dividend,"" saying he no longer deals with long commutes, frozen dinners, or lonely winters. ""Now, I have chai with my parents every evening. I have a cook. I have a driver. I have time,"" he said.About his career, Chadha said he did not step down but ""stepped up."" He added that remote work removes ""visa anxiety"" and lets him focus on building products and his own ideas.His move is part of a bigger trend: Indian tech professionals are the largest group on US H‑1B visas, which let skilled workers join tech, IT, and engineering jobs. Between October 2022 and September 2023, Indians got about 72.3 per cent of all H‑1B visas, enabling many to work for US tech companies and contribute to software innovation.Chadha said, ""I didn't leave the US to retire. I left to actually live.""Since President Donald Trump returned to office a second time, many aspects of US visa processing have grown more challenging for foreign workers and immigrants. US has paused immigrant visa issuance for applicants from a long list of countries, affecting those seeking permanent residency. The overall backlog of US visa and immigration cases has reached record highs, with millions of applications pending amid slower processing and enhanced fraud checks. Changes to H‑1B visas include a new high fee for new applications, and stricter social media vetting has led to appointment cancellations and delays for H‑1B holders abroad. These shifts have increased wait times and pushed them to 2027.","Ujjwal Chadha, an Indian-origin AI Engineering Lead, has left his job as a Developer at Microsoft in the United States and returned to India for a remote role.

Bad Bunny dominates Super Bowl stage with historic all-Spanish set

Trump, Jake Paul among critics of halftime performance





Sports betting influencer Amanda Vance claimed she lost more than 1,000 Instagram followers within minutes after posting a video of herself at Super Bowl 2026 in Santa Clara, California, appearing to ignore Bad Bunny’s halftime performance.Amanda, who has over 538,000 followers on Instagram and more than 72,000 on X, shared a clip from the stands at Levi’s Stadium showing herself dancing with wired headphones on while watching Turning Point USA’s alternative halftime programme on her phone.She later posted on X: “Lost 1k followers in 2 minutes on Instagram because i didn’t watch bad bunny’s halftime performance @amandacaseyvance on Instagram if the majority wants to follow me BTW.”The conservative organisation’s parallel halftime event was headlined by Kid Rock and featured country artists Brantley Gilbert, Gabby Barrett and Lee Brice.In her Instagram caption, Vance wrote: “Watching the American halftime show instead of BAD bunny during the Super Bowl,” adding, “I chose America and songs I know.”Her post drew swift backlash. Television personality and influencer Kat Dunn responded in the comments: “Puerto Rico is in America by the way.”Dunn later said she had unfollowed Vance, calling the move “performative” in a post on X.“Hi I’m one of the people who unfollowed you tonight and personally it was because i thought it was performative as f–k for you to set up a phone to record yourself ‘not watching’ a halftime performance (that you were literally at) and now I have your band of idiots sending ME (a white American lol) threats of deportation?? so like what are we even doing here,” Dunn wrote, sharing a screenshot of alleged abusive direct messages. One message read: “I hope ICE deports you.”The controversy unfolded as Bad Bunny’s halftime performance itself sparked political and cultural debate.The 31-year-old Puerto Rican star, Spotify’s most-streamed artist of 2025, became the first musician to perform entirely in Spanish at a Super Bowl halftime show. His 14-minute set celebrated Puerto Rican culture with nods to the island’s cuisine, fashion and artistic heritage.The performance featured appearances by Lady Gaga and Ricky Martin, with cameos from Pedro Pascal, Cardi B, Karol G and Jessica Alba. Bad Bunny delivered a 13-minute musical showcase highlighting his roots and a broader message of unity across the Americas.He spoke in English just once during the show, looking directly into the camera to say, “God Bless America.” The performance concluded with him holding a football emblazoned with the message: “Together, we are America.”Bad Bunny, a six-time Grammy winner, has previously spoken out against US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which has made him a polarising figure among some conservative commentators.US President Donald Trump criticised the halftime show in a post on Truth Social, calling it “absolutely terrible, one of the worst, EVER!” He further described the set as “an affront to the Greatness of America,” adding that “nobody understands a word this guy is saying.” Trump did not attend this year’s Super Bowl.Boxer and social media personality Jake Paul also voiced criticism online, echoing complaints from some viewers who took issue with the Spanish-language performance and Bad Bunny’s political stances.Supporters, however, praised the show for its cultural significance and inclusive messaging, arguing that it reflected the diversity of American audiences and the growing global influence of Latin music.","Sports betting influencer Amanda Vance lost more than 1,000 Instagram followers.

Meet Charles Radford: US sailor who spied on Kissinger during the 1971 India–Pakistan war,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/meet-charles-radford-us-sailor-who-spied-on-kissinger-during-the-1971-indiapakistan-war/articleshow/128125392.cms,"Who was Charles Radford

Spying from inside the White House system

The India–Pakistan war connection

Why the military supported Radford

Why Radford was never prosecuted



US back-channel diplomacy with China

Secret positions taken during the India–Pakistan war

Illegal surveillance inside the US government

Why the truth stayed hidden for decades





Charles Radford was not a master spy or a shadowy intelligence chief. He was a young US Navy yeoman with an unremarkable rank and extraordinary access. Yet during the early 1970s, Radford quietly became the conduit for one of the most serious internal spying scandals in American history. Working inside the National Security Council, he secretly copied highly classified documents linked to US foreign policy, including material handled by Henry Kissinger during the 1971 India–Pakistan war. The revelations, buried for decades and only recently brought to light, show how a junior sailor ended up at the centre of a Cold War power struggle between civilian leaders and the US military.Charles Radford was a Navy yeoman first class assigned to clerical duties at the National Security Council in the early 1970s. His role involved typing, filing and couriering documents for senior officials. That position gave him routine access to some of the most sensitive papers in the US government.Radford was described by investigators as diligent, personable and highly trusted. That trust allowed him to move freely through offices, briefcases and document bags without arousing suspicion.Between 1970 and 1974, Radford secretly copied thousands of classified documents.He passed them to senior officers in the Joint Chiefs of Staff, including Chairman Thomas Moorer.This was not foreign espionage. It was internal spying. The US military was monitoring the civilian leadership of its own government.Radford did not act for money. Investigators later concluded that he believed he was serving the interests of the armed forces, which felt increasingly sidelined by White House decision-making.The Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 erupted in December 1971, unfolding in the middle of Charles Radford’s intelligence activities inside the US military communications system. At the time, Henry Kissinger was managing an extremely volatile diplomatic situation involving India, Pakistan, China and the Soviet Union, with the crisis in East Pakistan intersecting directly with Cold War geopolitics and US strategic ambitions in Asia.Publicly, the United States declared that it was neutral in the India–Pakistan conflict. Privately, however, Richard Nixon and Kissinger were tilting toward Pakistan, which was playing a critical role as a secret diplomatic back channel to China ahead of Nixon’s planned opening to Beijing. This covert alignment meant that US public statements did not reflect internal decision-making during the war.Radford, a Navy yeoman on the White House National Security Council staff, had access to highly classified diplomatic and military traffic related to South Asia. He copied Kissinger’s memoranda, National Security Council meeting notes, and sensitive policy assessments that detailed how Washington was handling the crisis. While Radford was not spying because of the war itself, his actions captured Kissinger’s management of one of the most delicate and morally fraught crises of the Cold War, including US tolerance of Pakistan’s actions in East Pakistan.The documents Radford leaked showed that Nixon and Kissinger were secretly backing Pakistan diplomatically, sending military signals intended to pressure India, and prioritising Pakistan’s strategic value as a conduit to China over humanitarian concerns. These actions directly contradicted US claims of neutrality and reinforced suspicions that Washington was acting in bad faith during the conflict.Radford passed the classified material to Jack Anderson, who published the information in his nationally syndicated column. Anderson’s reporting exposed the gap between public US policy and private actions during a war that involved mass atrocities in East Pakistan, the flight of around ten million refugees into India, and direct Indian military intervention that ultimately led to the creation of Bangladesh.The leaks deeply embarrassed the Nixon administration and intensified internal conflict between the White House and the US military leadership. Radford’s role did not affect battlefield outcomes, but it played a significant part in revealing how US power was exercised behind closed doors during one of South Asia’s most consequential wars.Senior military leaders were deeply unhappy with Nixon and Kissinger’s foreign policy. They opposed détente with China and the Soviet Union. They resented being cut out of key decisions, especially during wartime.Radford’s spying allowed the Joint Chiefs to track civilian policy in real time. According to later testimony, some officers viewed this as a necessary corrective rather than a crime.This belief created a dangerous precedent: military leaders acting independently of elected authority.Radford was eventually caught after a separate leak investigation. He admitted copying documents. Polygraph tests indicated deception. Yet he was never charged.Nixon later testified that prosecuting Radford would have risked exposing:Instead, Radford was quietly removed from his post, reassigned and pushed out of service. The affair was buried under layers of classification.When Nixon testified under oath in 1975, parts of his testimony about the Radford affair were deemed too sensitive to release. Seven pages were sealed even from the grand jury and locked away by senior officials.Those pages remained hidden for nearly 50 years. Their release now reveals how close the US came to a constitutional crisis during Watergate, one that went far beyond political burglary.Radford’s story reshapes the Watergate narrative. It shows that Nixon was not only abusing power but was also confronting a national security apparatus that had begun operating independently of civilian control.The sailor himself was not the mastermind. He was the mechanism. The real story was the struggle over who controlled US foreign policy at the height of the Cold War.Charles Radford may have been a junior figure. But his actions exposed one of the deepest fault lines in American democracy.","Charles Radford was a Navy yeoman first class assigned to clerical duties at the National Security Council in the early 1970s.

‘Not for sale’: Pennsylvania farmer rejects $15 million data centre offer to preserve family farmland,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/not-for-sale-pennsylvania-farmer-rejects-15-million-data-centre-offer-to-preserve-family-farmland/articleshow/128124770.cms,"Why the farmer rejected the data centre deal



Developer pressure and near-legal action







A Pennsylvania farmer has turned down a reported $15 million data centre offer, choosing instead to permanently protect his family’s land through a conservation easement, a decision that has struck a chord as AI-driven infrastructure pushes deeper into rural America. Mervin Raudabaugh, a lifelong farmer in Cumberland County, sold the development rights on his 261-acre property for about $2 million, ensuring it can never be commercially developed. The land, farmed for decades and bound up with personal loss and memory, will remain agricultural even as demand for power-hungry data centres accelerates nationwide.Raudabaugh finalised the conservation easement on December 30, 2025, placing the farm in Silver Spring Township under permanent protection. The agreement compensates him for surrendering development rights while he retains ownership of the land. News of the decision began circulating widely in late January 2026, prompting renewed attention in early February.The choice was not purely financial. Raudabaugh has farmed the property for more than five decades, and the land carries deep family significance, including the barn where his mother passed away.He has described the farm as a legacy rather than a commodity, something to be stewarded for the future rather than sold to the highest bidder.The deal was enabled by Silver Spring Township’s voter-approved farmland preservation programme, launched in 2013 and funded by a $120 annual household tax. To date, the programme has helped preserve 21 properties, offering farmers a viable alternative to selling to developers. The easement on Raudabaugh’s farm is held by Lancaster Farmland Trust, which is responsible for enforcing the long-term restrictions.As demand for sites with access to power, water and transport infrastructure has surged, Raudabaugh faced persistent approaches from data centre developers. Township officials have said the pressure became intense enough that it nearly escalated into legal action, highlighting how aggressively companies are competing for rural land suitable for large-scale facilities.The case highlights a widening land-use conflict. According to Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, AI-driven data centres could occupy up to 1,000 square miles of land in the United States by 2030. At the same time, Pennsylvania is losing an estimated 1,200 acres of farmland each week to development, losses that are often irreversible once land is converted.Most landowners confronted with eight-figure offers choose to sell. Raudabaugh’s refusal has therefore become emblematic of a broader debate over local control, conservation funding and the long-term costs of the AI infrastructure boom. It also underscores the importance of preservation programmes in giving farmers meaningful alternatives when major developers come knocking.As AI adoption accelerates, similar conflicts are expected to multiply across rural America. Raudabaugh’s farm will remain agricultural in perpetuity, standing as a reminder that not every parcel of land is for sale, even in an era of unprecedented technological expansion.","Mervin Raudabaugh sold the development rights on his 261-acre property for about $2 million, ensuring it can never be commercially developed.

Body kept for nearly three months





In a horrific case, a Washington mother has been sentenced to 32 years in prison for starving and torturing her eight-year-old adopted daughter to death, then transporting the child’s body more than 1,000 miles in a rented U-Haul.Mandie Miller, 36, was sentenced by Spokane County Judge Rachelle Anderson after pleading guilty to homicide by abuse, second-degree child assault and two counts of unlawful imprisonment in the death of Meela Miller, her biological niece whom she had legally adopted.The horror unraveled in December 2022 when Miller and her boyfriend, Aleksander Kurmoyarov, 31, drove from Washington State to Mitchell, South Dakota, with a coffin in tow.According to the New York Post (NYP), funeral home staff grew suspicious when the couple arrived seeking burial arrangements but failed to produce proper documentation. Authorities were alerted, and soon discovered the child’s body inside a U-Haul trailer.Investigators later determined that Meela had died months earlier, in September 2022, after enduring prolonged abuse inside the couple’s Airway Heights home.Prosecutors said the child had been starved and restrained for hours at a time. By the time officers recovered her body, she weighed just 26 pounds.Spokane County Deputy Prosecutor Emily Sullivan told the court that home surveillance cameras captured disturbing footage, including the child being tied to a car seat with zip ties.“The facts before this court are undisputed. They did assault her, they did starve her, they did restrain her, they did torture her, and they did kill her,” she said, as quoted by NYP.The couple allegedly kept Meela’s body in their home for nearly three months, claiming they “wanted to spend more time with her,” according to the Daily Express UK.Judge Anderson rejected prosecutors’ recommendation of a 30-year sentence and instead imposed 32 years, the upper end of the standard range. “We’re here because a little girl was tortured, she was starved, her interests were not protected,” the judge said.During the emotional hearing, Meela’s biological mother, Andrea Miller, who is also Mandie’s sister, condemned the abuse but extended forgiveness. “You did this with no remorse, murdering my third child, my beautiful daughter,” she said.Miller briefly addressed the court, referencing her troubled childhood in foster care, and admitted her daughter “did not deserve any abuse or neglect.”Kurmoyarov has also pleaded guilty to second-degree murder, assault and unlawful imprisonment. He is scheduled to be sentenced separately.The chilling case has sparked widespread outrage, with prosecutors describing it as one of the most harrowing child abuse cases in the region’s recent memory.","Mandie Miller, 36, was sentenced by Spokane County Judge Rachelle Anderson.

Backdrop of deadly Islamabad attack





Pakistan’s Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman on Sunday launched a sharp attack on Pakistan’s handling of militancy and its Afghanistan policy, questioning how extremist elements continue to cross the border even as trade remains blocked.Speaking at a public gathering in Rawalpindi, Rehman highlighted what he described as a glaring contradiction in Islamabad’s approach towards Afghanistan. “In all these decades, we never paused to ask why our Afghan policy failed so miserably. Not a single pomegranate or melon can enter Pakistan, yet terrorists keep crossing the border,” he said, smiling as he made the remark.Referring to repeated claims by Pakistani authorities that militants were entering from Afghanistan, Rehman added, “Authorities say terrorists are coming from there. If they are coming, stop them. If they are coming, eliminate them. The Afghan government has never objected to your actions.”The JUI-F leader also criticised Pakistan’s broader foreign and economic policies, calling them “complete failures”. He said Islamabad’s diplomatic approach had left the country increasingly isolated.“India is our enemy, Afghanistan is our enemy, and even Iran and China are upset with us,” Rehman said, adding that the public deserved answers.“A nation cannot survive when its policies produce only isolation, mistrust and insecurity.”He argued that Pakistan’s foreign policy was being driven not by elected governments but by the military establishment. “One general comes and says we will negotiate; another comes and says we will wage war,” he said.Rehman also took aim at the government’s handling of the China-Pakistan economic corridor (CPEC), claiming that the flagship infrastructure project had stalled due to declining Chinese confidence.“CPEC has seen no real progress during this tenure because China no longer trusts us,” he said, questioning whether “even a single brick” had moved under the current government. He claimed Beijing had expected the Pakistan democratic movement (PDM) government to stabilise relations and revive projects, but remained dissatisfied.Rehman’s remarks come amid heightened tensions following a suicide bombing at a mosque in Islamabad on Friday that killed 69 people and injured more than 170, according to local media reports citing hospital officials. The blast occurred during Friday prayers at Imambargah Qasr-i-Khadijatul Kubra in the Tarlai area, Dawn reported.After Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif suggested on X that preliminary findings pointed to the attacker having travelled to and from Afghanistan, Kabul rejected the allegation. Afghanistan’s ministry of national defence termed the claim “irresponsible and baseless” and urged Pakistani authorities to take responsibility for internal security lapses, Afghan media outlet Ariana News reported.The Afghan ministry said similar accusations had been made in the past following attacks in Balochistan and other parts of Pakistan, without conclusive evidence.","Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman criticises Pakistan’s handling of militancy and its Afghanistan policy.

'Not Vassals Of Trump & Elon Musk': Spain's Deputy PM Makes Blistering Exit From 'Place Of Hate' X





Pakistan’s decision on granting a licence to Starlink to operate in its satellite internet market has been delayed amid data security concerns, geopolitical sensitivities and competition from Chinese firms, local media reported on Sunday.Starlink, owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk , is among five companies seeking approval to provide satellite-based internet services in Pakistan. However, officials say unresolved security considerations and broader geopolitical factors have slowed the clearance process.According to the Express Tribune, the government has raised concerns that Starlink’s services could allow certain data transmissions to bypass Pakistan’s monitoring, regulatory and safety checks. “We cannot allow a license to Starlink without ensuring a safety check to ensure the safety of the data of consumers in Pakistan,” a senior government official was quoted as saying by Express Tribune.Sources cited by the newspaper said authorities had tested scenarios in which Starlink was expected to pick up sensitive data while providing satellite-based internet services. “But the real reason is that the government has tested some cases in which Starlink was supposed to pick up some sensitive data while providing satellite-based internet services,” sources said.Officials added that the government is working to address these issues, which have delayed the approval process.The report also cited the fallout between US President Donald Trump and Elon Musk as a factor being weighed by the Pakistani establishment. While Trump and Musk had enjoyed a close relationship in the past, they later drifted apart. Officials indicated that Pakistan, which has seen improved ties with the United States since Trump returned to power last year, is cautious about taking steps that could draw scrutiny from Washington.At present, Pakistan maintains control over internet data traffic largely through Pakistan Telecommunication Company Limited, which holds a majority stake in the country’s undersea cable infrastructure. Authorities are concerned that similar oversight may not be feasible with satellite-based services, raising fears of potential data breaches or loss of regulatory control.Satellite internet services are expected to focus primarily on remote and underserved regions, including Balochistan, where conventional broadband infrastructure remains limited. Currently, authorities are able to monitor internet traffic and suspend connectivity when required for security reasons. Officials have expressed concern that enforcing similar controls over satellite-based networks could prove more challenging.The Pakistan Space Activities Regulatory Board has confirmed that five companies, including Starlink and China-based Shanghai Spacecom Satellite Technology Limited, have shown interest in entering the satellite internet market. Chinese firms already have a strong presence in Pakistan’s telecommunications sector and are viewed as direct competitors to US-based companies such as Starlink.While consultations with stakeholders have been completed, the PSARB has yet to finalise the licensing framework. According to officials, additional time is needed to establish safety mechanisms before satellite-based internet services are permitted to begin operations.","Starlink, owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk, is among five companies seeking approval to provide satellite-based internet services in Pakistan.

NEW DELHI: Global terror outfit Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the deadly blast at a Shia mosque in Islamabad that led to over three dozen casualties on Friday. Toll rose to 36 on Saturday after some critically injured people died in hospitals, said a PTI report.In a related development that has attracted the attention of Indian security establishment, the Islamic State in its latest al-Naba issue called on members of Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) to defect and join the Islamic State in Khorasan Province.The claim regarding the blast was issued via IS central's mouthpiece, Amaq, stating the attack was a Fidayeen operation carried out by a soldier of the Islamic State in Pakistan Province (ISPP) -- active since 2019 -- inside the mosque compound. Amaq claimed over 200 casualties in contrast to the official Pak govt admission of 36 deaths and injuries to scores.The suicide bomber was identified by Amaq as Saifullah Ansari. His photograph taking the bayah (oath of allegiance) was also posted by the IS mouthpiece. The statement also mentioned that hundreds of Pakistani Shias had joined the pro-Iran 'Zaynabiyoun brigade' militia in Syria.The claim by Amaq followed an official denial by Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which strongly rebutted any involvement in the incident.The blast, which occurred during prayers at the Khadijatul Kubra mosque in Tarlai area, was the deadliest in Islamabad since the 2008 Marriott hotel bombing.The explosion coincided with the visit of Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev to Pakistan. The attack is being seen as a result of growing sectarian tensions in the country.Earlier in Jan, ISKP had claimed responsibility for a blast in Bajaur district that killed a senior Lashkar commander named Najibullah.","Global terror outfit Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the deadly blast at a Shia mosque in Islamabad that led to over three dozen casualties on Friday.

'Home-Grown Ills': Islamabad Mosque Blast Triggers Blame Game As India Rejects Pakistan's Blame





The Islamic State on Saturday claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing at a Shiite mosque in Islamabad, which killed at least 36 people and injured many others.In a statement released through its Amaq News Agency, the Islamic State in Pakistan, an offshoot of Daesh, said the bomber opened fire at security guards when they tried to stop him at the entrance and then exploded inside among worshippers.The group also said Shiite Muslims in Pakistan were a target, claiming they provided recruits to militias fighting the Islamic State in Syria.The blast took place on Friday at the Khadijatul Kubra mosque-cum-shrine in the Tarlie area of the capital. The attacker, identified as 32-year-old Yasir from Peshawar, entered the mosque while worshippers were offering weekly prayers and detonated explosives.Authorities in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province said they arrested four suspects, including three alleged facilitators and the mastermind, during intelligence-based raids in Peshawar and Nowshera.Investigators said an identity card recovered during the probe confirmed the attacker’s identity. Official records showed his permanent address in Abbas Colony on Charsadda Road in Peshawar.Officials also said the attacker had spent around five months in Afghanistan before the bombing, where he allegedly received training in weapons handling and suicide attacks.Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif had earlier claimed that India and Afghanistan were involved in the attack, without presenting any evidence.India had strongly rejected the allegations, saying, ""It is unfortunate that, instead of seriously addressing the problems plaguing its social fabric, Pakistan should choose to delude itself by blaming others for its home-grown ills. India rejects any and every such allegation, which is as baseless as it is pointless.""","The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing at a Shiite mosque in Islamabad.

Pakistan has been invited to participate in upcoming talks between Iran and the United States aimed at easing tensions between the two countries, slated to take place on Friday in Turkey.“Pakistan has received the invitation for the upcoming talks between Iran and the United States,” Pakistan foreign office spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said while responding to a query, reported Dawn.Pakistan's deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar is expected to take part in the meeting, the daily reported citing a diplomatic source, adding that “Islamabad’s participation was seen as significant.”An Arab official told AFP on condition of anonymity that the meeting is likely to be held in Turkiye on Friday. The format of the talks remains unclear, though the official said the main meeting would take place that day.A regional official told Reuters that the priority of the talks was to avoid conflict and de-escalate tensions between Iran and the US, adding that several regional powers had been invited at the foreign ministers’ level.According to the official, countries invited include Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Egypt, Oman and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).US outlet Axios, citing two sources and a US official, reported that Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi was expected to meet US envoy Steve Witkoff in Istanbul to discuss a possible agreement related to Iran’s nuclear programme.Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian confirmed on Tuesday that he had instructed Araghchi to pursue “fair and equitable negotiations” in an environment “free from threats and unreasonable expectations”.The talks, he said in posts on X, would be held “within the framework of our national interests”.US President Donald Trump has said he is hopeful Washington would “work something out” with Iran but warned on Monday that “bad things would happen” if no deal was reached.In an interview with CNN on Sunday, Araghchi said: “President Trump said no nuclear weapons, and we fully agree. We fully agree with that. That could be a very good deal.”“In return, we expect sanctions to be lifted,” he added, while warning that Iran was prepared for war if talks failed, saying any conflict would likely spread beyond Iran.Turkiye has been leading diplomatic efforts to defuse tensions, with Araghchi visiting Istanbul last week and engaging with regional counterparts, including in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan.Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia and the UAE have assured Tehran that they would not allow their airspace or territory to be used for military action against Iran, while Jordan has said it would not act as a “launching pad” for any such action.","Pakistan has been invited to participate in upcoming talks between Iran and the United States.

Imran Khan’s Sisters Allege Illegal Isolation, Stage Protest Outside Adiala Jail





A Pakistani anti-terrorism court (ATC) on Tuesday issued non-bailable arrest warrants against Aleema Khan, sister of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan in connection with a protest held in Islamabad in November 2024.According to news agency PTI citing a media report, the warrants were issued by the ATC in Rawalpindi after Aleema Khan failed to appear before the court despite earlier directions.The court also issued non-bailable arrest warrants against her two guarantors and ordered that all three be arrested and produced before it on Wednesday, without fail. Aleema’s application seeking exemption from personal appearance was rejected.The case, registered at Sadiqabad Police Station, relates to a protest at D-Chowk in Islamabad on November 24, 2024 and includes charges of protesting against the government, chanting anti-government slogans, vandalism and stone-pelting. ATC Judge Amjad Ali Shah conducted the hearing.The court also issued a show-cause notice to the Superintendent of Police (SP), Rawal, for failing to execute the arrest warrants.The SP has been directed to appear before the court on Wednesday and explain why Aleema Khan was not arrested and presented despite clear orders, according to Pakistani news website Express Tribune.During Monday’s hearing, Aleema Khan’s defence counsel sought a one-day exemption, citing difficulties in travel and daily affairs after her bank accounts, Computerised National Identity Card and passport were reportedly blocked. The court, however, did not accept the plea.The proceedings have drawn attention as Aleema Khan had earlier skipped multiple hearings in the case and appeared only after the court issued property seizure orders and several arrest warrants. She is among those nominated as accused in protest-related cases filed following the November demonstrations.The protest followed Imran Khan’s “final call” for nationwide demonstrations demanding the restoration of the party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) electoral mandate, the release of party leaders and the reversal of constitutional changes.The D-Chowk protest ended on November 26 after a security operation, with several cases registered across Rawalpindi district.

Troops ‘physically handicapped’ by vast terrain

Insurgency background and wider fallout





Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif said the country’s security forces are “physically handicapped” by the sheer size of Balochistan as they battle a fresh surge in militant violence, after authorities reported killing 177 insurgents in sweeping counter-terror operations across the province.Addressing the national assembly, Asif described the scale of the challenge facing troops deployed in Pakistan’s largest and least populated province, where coordinated attacks triggered one of the deadliest security crises in recent years. His remarks came after militants launched simultaneous assaults in multiple towns, targeting civilians, homes and security installations.“Balochistan constitutes over 40 per cent of Pakistan geographically...To control it is much more difficult than a populated city, and it needs deployment of massive forces. Our troops are deployed there and are in action against them (terrorists), but they are physically handicapped by guarding and patrolling such a big area,” Asif told lawmakers, as quoted by PTI.Security officials said the death toll of militants had risen to 177 in the past two days following large-scale raids and gun battles.The operations were launched after insurgents carried out coordinated attacks at 12 locations, with authorities confirming that at least 17 police and security personnel were killed, along with dozens of civilians.Asif said the weekend violence claimed 33 civilian lives and 17 members of the security forces. He ruled out talks with the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), saying no negotiations would be held with “terrorists” responsible for killing civilians, including women and children.Balochistan, which borders Iran and Afghanistan, has long faced a separatist insurgency driven by ethnic Baloch groups who accuse the central government of discrimination and exploitation. Authorities say groups such as the BLA have targeted security forces, infrastructure and projects linked to the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor.Train services between Balochistan and the rest of Pakistan remained suspended for a third day, while mobile and internet services were cut in several districts during clean-up operations. Provincial officials said services were expected to resume once the security situation stabilised.Asif dismissed claims that Balochistan had been neglected, saying the province had seen development, including multiple airports. He also rejected the “missing persons” narrative, alleging that names of militants killed in operations had appeared on such lists. “This narrative has been concocted. I also used to support this cause and protest over it. But, terrorists and criminal elements have hijacked all these narratives,” he said.","Khawaja Asif says security forces are 'physically handicapped' by sheer size of Balochistan.

In a bizarre case, police in Pakistan’s Rawalpindi district registered a case on Sunday of abduction against a “jinn” (supernatural spirit) following the disappearance of an 11-year-old boy, news agency ANI reported, citing ARY News.The incident occurred in the garrison city when the boy went missing from his home on January 21. After ten days without any sign of the child, his father approached the Taxila Police Station and filed a First Information Report (FIR).In the FIR, the father alleged that supernatural entities, known locally as jinns, had forced his son to run away.The complainant said that this is not the first time such an incident has occurred. He added that the jinns had “abducted” his son several times before.He highlighted that while the boy had returned home after previous incidents, this time ten days had passed without his return, prompting him to formally accuse the supernatural spirits of kidnapping.According to ARY News, similar claims have been reported in Pakistan’s legal system before. In Lahore, a mother had lodged a case against jinns over the disappearance of her married daughter, a matter that eventually reached the courts.A report by Dawn in September stated that a special investigation team of Lahore police was formed under the directions of the city's high court Chief Justice Aalia Neelam to probe the six-year-old case of the missing woman, believed to have been abducted by a jinn.The team, headed by Lahore Investigation DIG Zeeshan Raza, was tasked with locating and recovering the woman.","11-year-old boy went missing from his home in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, on January 21.

(With PTI inputs)





Combat-related deaths in Pakistan rose 43% month-on-month to 361 in January, data released on Monday by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) showed.The fatalities included 242 militants, 73 civilians, and 46 security personnel, according to the Islamabad-based think tank.At least 135 people were injured, among them 71 were civilians, 52 security personnel, and 12 militants.PICSS reported 87 militant attacks across Pakistan in January, a 28% rise from the 68 incidents recorded in December 2025. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa bore the brunt, with 58 incidents—38 in the mainland districts and 20 in the tribal areas. The restive Balochistan followed with 27 attacks, while Punjab reported two targeted incidents.Balochistan emerged as the main theatre of militant violence and security operations, recording its highest monthly militant death toll since the current insurgency began in 2001. While the province remained relatively calm for most of January, violence surged dramatically in the final two days. Coordinated attacks by the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) across at least 12 locations, followed by intensified security operations, placed the province at the centre of the conflict.At least 172 militants were killed, the majority in the final two days of last month.Security forces arrested at least 60 suspected militants during the previous month, while militant groups kidnapped eight individuals. In Punjab, 53 militants were arrested, 48 of them from Lahore, the state capital and Pakistan's second-largest city.Meanwhile, no militant attacks were reported in January from Sindh, Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), Islamabad, or the Gilgit-Baltistan region, according to the data.","Combat-related deaths in Pakistan rose 43% month-on-month to 361 in January.

Balochistan Crisis: Pakistan-Origin Commentator Takes Apart Islamabad, Exposes Lies On India

What is clear: the scale, coordination and symbolism of the violence mark a sharp escalation in a conflict long treated by Islamabad as containable.

Why it matters

The big picture

What's different now is the interplay of three key factors:

Zoom in: What is ""Herof""?

Herof Phase 2.0 expands on that template:

Geographic spread: Violence has been reported in Quetta, Noshki, Mastung, Kalat, Kharan, Panjgur, Gwadar, Pasni, Turbat, Kech and Awaran.

Operational depth: Suicide bombings, vehicle-borne explosives and armed assaults occurred almost simultaneously.

Human footprint: For the first time, women are reported to be participating in direct combat roles alongside men.

What they are saying

Between the lines

Zoom in: Bashir Zaib's message

The regional angle

What’s next

The bottom line





Pakistan's latest surge of violence in Balochistan reflects a deepening, not isolated, security crisis as the Baloch Liberation Army escalates its campaign through ""Operation Herof.""Over several days, the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) unleashed what it calls ""Operation Herof, Phase 2.0,"" a wave of coordinated attacks across Balochistan that included suicide bombings, gun assaults and arson in major towns and remote districts alike.Pakistani authorities say dozens of civilians and security personnel were killed, followed by one of the largest counterterrorism strikes in decades. Officials claim more than 130 militants were killed in 48 hours alone. However, the BLA has refuted these official claims and reiterate that it inflicted severe casualties on Pakistan forces.Balochistan sits at the intersection of Pakistan’s security, economy and foreign policy- and all three are now under strain. The province anchors China’s Belt and Road ambitions through the port of Gwadar, hosts globally significant mineral deposits at Reko Diq, and borders both Iran and Afghanistan at a time of regional instability.As analyst Michael Kugelman put it after the attacks, ""Today’s attacks in Balochistan should serve as a wake up call to those… keen to invest in Pakistan’s critical mineral reserves."" He warned that many of those reserves lie in areas now directly hit by violence- and that resentment over ""external exploitation of local resources"" is central to the insurgency.For Islamabad, the stakes go beyond security. Investor confidence, relations with Beijing, and Pakistan’s credibility as a destination for critical minerals are all on the line.Balochistan's troubles are hardly new, but they're shiftingSince Pakistan's birth, Baloch ethnic factions have, time and again, risen up against the central government. They've sought more autonomy, a larger share of the country's wealth, or even complete independence. Each insurrection has been met with military force, temporary quiet, and, ultimately, unaddressed issues.First, economic importance. Balochistan is now crucial to Pakistan's economic story. Think of the Chinese-funded projects and the West's interest in copper, gold, and rare minerals.Second, political disillusionment. Elections since 2018 have been widely criticized, and the space for peaceful opposition has shrunk. This has intensified the feeling that political solutions are impossible.Third, the evolution of militant groups. Organizations like the BLA have become more dangerous, adept at using the media, and ideologically focused. They've adopted tactics from global insurgencies while staying rooted in local grievances.As per a report in the Native Voices: ""Herof is a Balochi literary term meaning ""black storm"", commonly used in Baloch poetry, including by the veteran poet Karim Dashti.""The BLA first used the term in August 2024, launching Herof 1.0 with attacks across 12 districts. That campaign shocked authorities by striking areas previously considered relatively stable, including Lasbela and Musakhel, and by introducing a female suicide bomber into the group’s operations.An intelligence officer cited by Native Voices estimated 800 to 1,000 fighters may be involved- a number that suggests months of recruitment, training and coordination.Pakistani officials describe the violence as foreign-orchestrated terrorism.Balochistan chief minister Sarfraz Bugti said security forces killed 145 members of what he termed ""Fitna al-Hindustan,"" the state’s label for the BLA. He claimed militants aimed to seize hostages and storm government installations, and alleged backing from India and Afghanistan- accusations both countries deny.Residents recount chaos and fear. ""(It) was a very scary day in the history of Quetta,"" said Khan Muhammad, a local resident, describing armed men openly patrolling streets before security forces moved in.India’s foreign ministry rejected Pakistan’s claims, calling them ""baseless,"" and urged Islamabad to address ""long-standing demands of its people in the region"" instead of deflecting blame outward.As per the Native Voices, the Baloch resentment has roots in a series of flashpoints.Several incidents hardened public anger: the killing of university student Hayat Baloch by paramilitary forces in 2020; the death of Malik Naz inside her home the same year; the crackdown on the Haq Do Tehreek protests in Gwadar; and the custodial killing of Baalach Mula Baksh in 2023. Each episode sparked protests. Each was followed by arrests, internet shutdowns, or worse.The arrest of activist Dr Mahrang Baloch in 2025 marked another turning point. To many young Baloch, her detention signaled that even peaceful dissent had become intolerable. Analysts say that belief has fed recruitment into armed groups, including among women, a shift now visible on the battlefield.Each episode narrowed political space- and widened the insurgency’s recruitment pool.As Kugelman noted, framing the crisis solely around body counts ""telegraphs your policy failures- because the question is why are there so many fighters to start with."" Analysts argue the BLA has successfully tapped into accumulated resentment, especially among young Baloch who see peaceful activism punished and armed resistance rewarded with attention.One of the most striking elements of Herof II has been its media choreography.As per the Native Voices, the BLA released new footage of its leader Bashir Zaib, seated on the back of a motorcycle, moving through rugged terrain believed to lie between Kharan and Chagai- a region synonymous with mineral wealth.Observers see layered symbolism: mobility, control and defiance. A senior Baloch journalist described the location choice as deliberate- close to Reko Diq and other high-profile mining sites that have drawn interest from companies like Barrick Gold and financiers such as the Asian Development Bank.The subtext to Islamabad and investors alike: the insurgency can operate where Pakistan’s economic future is being planned.Timing matters.Analysts believe the BLA launched Herof II amid unrest in neighboring Iran’s Baloch-populated regions and persistent instability in Afghanistan to amplify its message beyond Pakistan’s borders.Balochistan’s long frontier with Iran- and proximity to Gulf shipping lanes- means sustained violence here resonates in Middle Eastern, US and European policy circles, particularly as Western governments search for alternatives to Chinese-dominated mineral supply chains.The message appears aimed as much at foreign capitals as at Islamabad.In the short term, security operations will intensify. Expect heavier troop deployments, stricter controls around mining projects, transport corridors and Chinese-linked infrastructure, and continued information blackouts during operations. Islamabad will likely double down on its claims of foreign sponsorship, even as evidence remains contested.The longer-term trajectory is murkier.The paradox facing Pakistan is stark: Balochistan is now too economically important to ignore- but remains too politically neglected to stabilize.Unless that gap is addressed, the ""black storm"" the BLA invokes may only deepen, reshaping the conflict from a peripheral insurgency into a central challenge to the state.The spy-action film Dhurandhar has inadvertently revived global interest in the region by featuring elements that touch on Pakistan’s underworld and geopolitics set around Baloch communities.Dhurandhar revolves around a simple but unsettling idea: in covert conflict, what matters most is not the spectacle of action but the slow, almost invisible shifts beneath it. That logic offers a useful lens for what’s happening in Balochistan.Today, Balochistan can no longer be treated only as a security issue measured through attacks and casualties. It has become a political problem rooted in governance, representation, and legitimacy, and it cannot be managed through messaging, denial, or communication blackouts.","Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) unleashed what it calls ""Operation Herof, Phase 2.0,"" a wave of coordinated attacks across Balochistan that included suicide bombings, gun assaults and arson in major towns and remote districts alike.

Bangladesh elections 2026





Zaima Rahman, daughter of Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) chief Tarique Rahman, took to the streets of the capital on a rickshaw to campaign for her father in the high-profile Dhaka-17 constituency ahead of the February 12 general elections.Videos circulating online show the London-trained barrister riding through busy neighbourhoods with Fatema Khatun, caregiver to former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, as she handed out pamphlets and appealed directly to voters.Beginning her outreach at Gulshan Police Plaza, Zaima moved through streets, shops, cafes and office buildings, distributing leaflets bearing the BNP’s election symbol, the “Sheaf of Paddy.” She was seen speaking with pedestrians, rickshaw pullers, vendors and office staff.“My father, Tarique Rahman, is the ‘Sheaf of Paddy’ candidate in Dhaka-17. I am asking for your votes in his favour,” she told residents during the campaign trail.Rahman, 60, is considered a front-runner in what will be Bangladesh’s first general election since the ouster of long-time Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in 2024. He faces a key challenge in Dhaka-17 from Jamaat-e-Islami candidate Dr SM Khalekuzzaman.The BNP supremo recently rejected a proposal from Jamaat-e-Islami for a unity government, asserting confidence in his party’s prospects. “How can I form a government with my political opponents, and then who would be in the opposition?” he said in an interview, expressing hope that rivals would play the role of a “good opposition” if elected.Rahman returned to Bangladesh in December after nearly two decades in exile, following the deteriorating health of his mother, Khaleda Zia, who passed away on December 30, 2025. Zia was the country’s first woman prime minister.General elections will be held on February 12, 2026, to elect 300 members to the Jatiya Sangsad (National Parliament). The vote will also be accompanied by a constitutional referendum on the July Charter.More than 127 million voters are eligible to cast their ballots, making it one of the largest democratic exercises of the year. As many as 1,981 candidates are contesting the polls.The election is being conducted under an interim government led by Muhammad Yunus, which has been in place since Sheikh Hasina’s removal following a student-led uprising in 2024.Hasina, now in exile in India, was later convicted by a Bangladesh tribunal for allowing the use of lethal force against protesters during the unrest, which left around 1,400 people — many of them students and teenagers — dead. She has been sentenced to death in absentia.The Awami League, which won the previous four elections under Hasina, has been suspended and is not participating in the upcoming vote. This has turned the contest largely into a bipolar fight between the BNP and the 11-Party Alliance led by Jamaat-e-Islami and the National Citizen Party (NCP).The BNP has nominated 288 candidates and is seeking additional seats through allies and independents. The 11-Party Alliance is contesting 298 seats, while Islami Andolan Bangladesh has fielded candidates in 253 constituencies. The National Democratic Front (NDF), led by the Jatiya Party (Ershad), is contesting 206 seats. Leftist parties under the Democratic United Front are in 149 seats, and the Greater Sunni Alliance is contesting 64 constituencies.Key campaign issues include unemployment, corruption, extortion, proportional representation and outreach to youth and minority voters. Postal voting will be used for the first time, and the “No Vote” option has also been reintroduced.With opinion polls indicating an edge for the BNP but a strong showing expected from Jamaat-e-Islami, the February 12 election is set to reshape Bangladesh’s political landscape.","Zaima Rahman, daughter of Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) chief Tarique Rahman, took to the streets of the capital on a rickshaw to campaign for her father in the high-profile Dhaka-17 constituency.

Yunus Sparks Fresh Alarm As Greater Bangladesh Map Gifted To US Envoy Includes India’s Northeast

UN human rights office formally approached

Dispute over investigation and wider fallout





Bangladesh’s interim government, led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus , has approached the United Nations human rights office seeking assistance for a fair and transparent investigation into the killing of student leader Sharif Osman Hadi Hadi, 32, a prominent figure during the July–August 2024 mass protests that led to the fall of the Sheikh Hasina-led Awami League government, was shot in the head during an election campaign event in Dhaka on December 12.He later died on December 18 after being flown to Singapore for treatment.According to Bangladesh’s state-run BSS, the country’s Permanent Mission in Geneva sent a formal Note Verbale on Friday to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), requesting cooperation in the investigation.The interim government’s Chief Adviser’s press wing confirmed the development on Saturday.“The government of Bangladesh has reiterated that it is firmly committed to identifying those responsible for the killing of Shaheed Sharif Osman Hadi and bringing them to justice,” the press wing said, as cited by news agency PTI.The request seeks technical and institutional assistance to ensure that the probe meets international standards.Hadi was the spokesperson of Inqilab Moncho and had emerged as a national figure during last year’s youth-led uprising. He was also contesting as a parliamentary candidate in the February 12 elections.In January, Dhaka Metropolitan Police’s Detective Branch filed charges against 17 people, including alleged shooter Faisal Karim Masud. Police said the killing was driven by “political vengeance” and carried out at the behest of the Awami League.Detective branch additional commissioner Md Shafiqul Islam had claimed that Masud was linked to the Awami League’s student wing, Chhatra League, and that the murder was ordered by Awami League-nominated ward councillor Taizul Islam Chowdhury Bappi.Hadi’s party has rejected the police chargesheet, alleging involvement of state agencies in the killing. The interim government had last year banned both the Awami League and Chhatra League.The killing sparked violent protests across the country and further unsettled Bangladesh’s already volatile political situation.The interim administration has pledged to ensure “the highest standards of transparency and accountability” in the case.Hadi’s death also strained relations with India after some groups alleged an Indian connection to the crime. New Delhi has firmly denied the claims, dismissing them as a “false narrative”.Supporters of Hadi have described him as a martyr and a symbol of Bangladesh’s youth-driven anti-establishment movement.","Student leader Sharif Osman Hadi Hadi, 32, was shot in the head during an election campaign event in Dhaka on December 12.

As Bangladesh Elections Near, Hindu Minority Faces Rising Attacks, Islamist Return And State Silence





A veteran Bangladesh politician, Bangladesh Awami League senior leader Ramesh Chandra Sen died on Saturday while in custody at Dinajpur District Jail.Sen, 83, reportedly became unwell inside the jail early Saturday morning and was taken to Dinajpur Medical College Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at around 9:29 am local time, according to prison officials. Jail Superintendent Farhad Sarkar said the body would be handed over to his family once all legal procedures have been completed, as reported by ANI.His death, only days before the country’s general election scheduled for February 12, has heightened concerns over the treatment of incarcerated political leaders and renewed allegations of custodial negligence. Organising Secretary of Bangladesh Awami League Central Committee Shafiul Alam Chowdhury Nadel, alleging negligence and calling out Yunus said on X, ""Ramesh Chandra Sen from a teacher to a politician and a public representative. A five-time MP and former minister—this elderly, ill man was arrested and led away with his hands tied. He has now passed away in Dinajpur jail due to a lack of medical treatment. Yunus, you must answer for this.""President of Bangladesh Students' League Saddam Hussein also claimed medical neglect saying, ""Eighteen months ago, this widely respected, elderly leader was attacked, humiliated by BNP-Jamaat mob and taken into police custody, without any specific charges.One false and fabricated case after another was imposed on him to justify his continued detention. Despite his deteriorating health, he was deliberately denied bail, denied minimum medical treatment, and denied basic human rights. "" ""At 86 years of age, Sri Ramesh Chandra Sen was kept behind bars for one and a half years without trial and without proper medical care. This happened under the illegal, murderous-fascist Yunus regime, which chose cruelty over humanity and repression over the rule of law,"" he added.Further mentioning other Awami League politicians in custody he added, ""According to Ain o Salish Kendra (ASK), at least 107 prisoners died in custody in 2025 alone—the majority of them leaders and activists of the Awami League. In almost every case, the authorities casually cited causes such as “heart attack” or “sudden illness.” Despite clear legal provisions, not a single custodial death has been properly investigated by this illegal government. ""The veteran Hindu leader had been in custody since August 16, 2024, after being arrested by police in Thakurgaon. ""Bangladesh Police have arrested a Hindu leader of Awami League and put him on a farcical trial. Ramesh Chandra Sen, an octogenarian, was arrested from his house in Thakurgaon who was having his dinner. Surprisingly, he hails from Mirza Fakhrul's constituency,"" the Bangladesh Awami League had said, just days after his arrest nearly two years ago.A court subsequently ordered his transfer to Thakurgaon District Jail and later to Dinajpur. There, he was facing three cases, including a murder charge linked to the political turmoil that followed a mass uprising against the government of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.Born on April 30, 1940, in Ruhia Union under Thakurgaon Sadar Upazila, Sen was elected multiple times from the Thakurgaon-1 constituency to the Jatiya Sangsad. A presidium member of the Awami League, he secured his most recent parliamentary victory in the 2024 general election, before the party was later barred from political activity by the current interim administration.Meanwhile, the interim government, headed by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus and tasked with overseeing the electoral process for February 12 elections, has faced criticism at home and abroad over its human rights record. Opposition figures contend that deaths of prominent detainees, particularly former Awami League leaders, point to systemic failings and raise concerns about the adequacy of medical care in custody.His death comes at a politically sensitive moment in Bangladesh, with the Awami League excluded from the forthcoming polls and rival parties competing for advantage.","Bangladesh Awami League senior leader Ramesh Chandra Sen died on Saturday while in custody at Dinajpur District Jail.

Bangladesh’s main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) on Friday unveiled its election manifesto, promising electoral reforms and accountable governance, while outlining a tougher foreign policy stance, centred on border security and river-water sharing.The manifesto was launched by BNP chairman Tarique Rahman in Dhaka. The party pledged to uphold the “dignity of the vote” and ensure that no one is above the law, committing to a government that is accountable and directly answerable to citizens.A key feature of the manifesto is its emphasis on long-standing flashpoints in Bangladesh’s relationship with India, although New Delhi hasn’t been mentioned in as many words in the bullet points, including cross-border shootings, alleged “push-ins” and unresolved sharing of common rivers. The BNP said it would adopt a more assertive approach to frontier management and river diplomacy if voted to power.Under what it calls a “Bangladesh Before All” doctrine, the party framed its foreign policy around “equality and self-dignity” and the slogan “Friend Yes, Master No”. It said Dhaka would not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries and would not allow interference in its own.The strongest language came for border-related concerns.The manifesto vows to take “a strict position” to stop “border killing, push-in, and smuggling”, reflecting persistent Bangladeshi complaints over deaths along the India-Bangladesh border and allegations of people being pushed across without due process.On river-water sharing, the BNP promised “effective measures” to secure Bangladesh’s “fair share” from common rivers “like Teesta and Padma”. It proposed implementing a “Teesta Master Plan”, pursuing a Padma barrage project and strengthening the Joint River Commission (JRC), the bilateral body responsible for managing shared rivers.Although India is not explicitly named in the manifesto’s bullet points, the border and river issues highlighted are central to Dhaka-New Delhi ties.The manifesto also signals interest in reviving regional platforms, promising to make SAARC “effective” and to pursue ASEAN membership, potentially broadening Bangladesh’s diplomatic options beyond its immediate neighbourhood.The manifesto was unveiled just six days ahead of Bangladesh’s national elections scheduled for February 12, the first since the ouster of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina in 2024. With the Awami League barred from contesting, BNP is widely seen as the front runner in the upcoming elections.

DHAKA: Violent anti-govt protests returned to the streets of Dhaka, but this time against the interim administration headed by Muhammad Yunus.Hundreds of govt employees, demanding implementation of the Ninth National Pay Scale and raising slogans - such as ""there is no rice in the stomach, development is only in words"" and ""injustice will be washed away with blood""- against Yunus, marched through the Bangladesh capital as police used tear gas, water cannons and sound grenades to disperse them. But the worst scenes of clashes were from outside chief adviser Yunus's official residence 'Jamuna' - the first protest directly targetting Yunus.At least 40 protesters were injured outside 'Jamuna', as security personnel lathi-charged the govt employees as they broke barricades backed by members of Inqilab Moncho - a political party that has been against Yunus after its co-founder - a radical Islamist and India baiter - Sharif Osman Hadi died on Dec 18, six days after he was shot in the head in Dhaka.Inqilab Moncho protesters seeking an impartial UN-led probe into Hadi's death, joined the govt employees as they moved towards Yunus's residence.The protests ahead of the polls came as an embarrassment for the Yunus administration which said that ""many foreign journalists and international observers have already arrived in the country"" and appealed to citizens to ""demonstrate the highest level of responsibility and cooperation to ensure a peaceful election"".","Violent anti-govt protests returned to the streets of Dhaka, but this time against the interim administration headed by Muhammad Yunus.

US Vice President JD Vance criticised the European Union on Thursday over its expected move to fine X, saying the bloc should not penalise platforms for refusing to “engage in censorship.”In a post on X, Vance asked the EU to not target American firms over what he described as ‘garbage,’ and urged them to support ‘free speech.’“Rumors swirling that the EU commission will fine X hundreds of millions of dollars for not engaging in censorship. The EU should be supporting free speech, not attacking American companies over garbage,” he said.According to The Capitol Forum, the European Commission is preparing to issue its first-ever sanction under the Digital Services Act (DSA) in the coming days, and possibly as early as Friday. Two people with direct knowledge of the discussions told the Forum the final timing and size of the penalty were still being debated within the Commission.The expected fine is not related to content takedowns but to alleged violations on advertisement transparency, data access and deceptive design, the sources told The Capitol Forum. Last year, the Commission issued preliminary charges accusing X - formerly Twitter - of deceiving users through its blue checkmark system, arguing that the verification badge did not allow users to make informed choices about the accounts they interact with.The upcoming action is expected to be modest in size, but it would mark the EU’s first enforcement step under the DSA, a law that significantly expands obligations for large online platforms operating in the bloc.","US Vice President JD Vance criticised the European Union over its expected move to fine X.

Charlie Kirk: Chilling New Video Shows Armed Man Running During Panic After Assassination | Watch

Allie Beth Stuckey pushes back on Candace Owens’ claim





Candace Owens made a strong claim about Charlie Kirk . She said Charlie Kirk was “betrayed” by people inside Turning Point USA. She wrote on X that she is “fully confident” about this. She also said she will soon share proof and name the people she thinks hurt him. Owens told people who gave money to Turning Point USA that they should ask for a refund because “leadership knew.”Charlie Kirk, who was a well-known American political activist, was shot and killed on September 10 while speaking at Utah Valley University. He was doing a “Prove Me Wrong” talk at the campus when the shooting happened. After his death, Donald Trump said Charlie had once told him he might run for president one day.Owens’ new claim has brought a lot of attention because many people loved Charlie Kirk. Many want to know what she will say next. Many also want to see the proof she says she has. There is also tension inside the Turning Point USA community. This is because some people close to Charlie do not agree with Owens.A Christian influencer named Allie Beth Stuckey spoke out against Candace Owens. She talked about it on her show, Relatable. Stuckey said she did not want to answer Owens in public at first. But she said she felt hurt when Candace Owens suggested she “did not care” about who killed Charlie Kirk.Stuckey wrote on X that she cares deeply and wants the truth. She also said that “just asking questions” does not allow people to spread wrong claims.Allie Beth Stuckey said she wants Christians to look for truth in a fair way. She said words matter, and people should speak with care. Stuckey has been invited to take Charlie’s place on parts of his college tour. She has also appeared on the Charlie Kirk Show since his passing.While Allie Beth Stuckey spoke gently, Candace Owens made an even bigger claim. She said, “Charlie was betrayed. By everyone.” Her words have shocked many people who followed Charlie and his work.After Charlie Kirk’s death, his wife Erika Kirk became the new CEO of Turning Point USA. She said she wants to keep his work going. Donald Trump gave a touching message at Charlie’s memorial and comforted Erika during the service.Also Read: Candace Owens Fights Back As French Ministry Rejects Her Macron And Charlie Kirk Story Over Spelling Mistake",Candace Owens made a strong claim about Charlie Kirk.

Biggest ever US travel ban in the works?

The United States is planning to expand the number of countries that were covered by its travel ban - and the new list may include over 30 countries.US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, on Thursday, during an interview on Fox News’ The Ingraham Angle, when asked whether President Donald Trump’s administration would increase the number to 32, she said “I won’t be specific on the number, but it’s over 30, and the president is continuing to evaluate countries. ""In June, Trump signed a proclamation banning citizens of 12 countries from entering the United States and restricting those from seven others, saying it was needed to protect against “foreign terrorists” and other security threats, Reuters reported.The bans applied to both immigrants and non-immigrants, such as tourists, students and business travellers.Noem did not specify which countries would be added to the list. “If they don’t have a stable government there, if they don’t have a country that can sustain itself and tell us who those individuals are and help us vet them, why should we allow people from that country to come here to the United States?” she said.Reuters previously reported that the Trump administration was considering banning citizens of 36 additional countries from entering the United States, according to an internal State Department cable.An expansion of the list would mark a further escalation of migration measures the administration had taken since the shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, DC, last week.Investigators said the shooting was carried out by an Afghan national who entered the US in 2021 through a resettlement programme under which Trump administration officials have argued there was insufficient vetting. Days after the shooting, Trump vowed to “permanently pause” migration from all “Third World Countries,” although he did not identify any by name or define “third-world countries.”Prior to that, officials from the Department of Homeland Security said Trump had ordered a widespread review of asylum cases approved under the administration of his predecessor, Democratic President Joe Biden, and Green Cards issued to citizens of 19 countries. Since returning to office in January, Trump has aggressively prioritised immigration enforcement, sending federal agents to major US cities and turning away asylum seekers at the US-Mexico border. His administration has frequently highlighted the deportation push, but until now it has put less emphasis on efforts to reshape legal immigration.","US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the president is 'continuing to evaluate countries' In June, President Donald Trump signed a proclamation banning citizens of 12 countries from entering the United States.

The dispute intensifies scrutiny on the controversial matter.

Livestream dispute ends with Candace Owens excluded after she pushes for virtual appearance





The tense back-and-forth between Candace Owens and Turning Point USA has taken a sharp turn, as TPUSA’s Blake Neff announced the organization will move forward with a livestream addressing allegations tied to Charlie Kirk ’s death, without Owens participating. The conservative commentator had previously suggested that TPUSA “betrayed” Kirk, who was assassinated on September 10, and was offered a chance to discuss her claims on The Charlie Kirk Show.At first, Owens appeared ready to join in, but a clash over whether she would appear in person or remotely triggered an online debate over her intentions. Now, TPUSA has shut the door on her involvement, escalating what has quickly turned into one of the most controversial moments in conservative media this year.The conflict erupted when Owens claimed that the scheduled December 15 livestream was planned without consulting her. Neff responded publicly on X, reminding her that TPUSA had already committed to issuing a formal response: “Yesterday, we made it clear that we would be scheduling a formal response to the allegations and accusations you have made. We've decided that response will be delivered during a livestream on December 15th. ”He then delivered a decisive message: “Thank you for your response letting us know you will not be joining the in-person conversation.We will be proceeding without you.”Owens, however, insisted she never refused to participate. She argued that she could not attend in person, citing that she hosts her own live show at the same time. “December 15th does not work in-person and 2pm PT is also literal time I do my podcast LIVE everyday (which you knew), but we will happily cancel the daily podcast and will join you guys virtually instead for the livestream on the 15th if that works on your end?”Her proposal to participate remotely appears to have been rejected, sparking new accusations online that Owens was trying to avoid a direct confrontation. While she maintains she is willing to debate, TPUSA has clearly decided to move on without her.With Kirk’s death still shrouded in speculation and Owens’ accusations gaining traction without evidence, the upcoming livestream is expected to intensify scrutiny around both sides. One thing is certain: even before the broadcast airs, the battle over who controls this narrative has already begun.Also Read: “She’s a liar and a con artist”: Candace Owens roasted for ‘running scared’ from TPUSA's Charlie Kirk livestream she bragged she’d win","Candace Owens and Turning Point USA have been involved in a public spat.

Planning your year around UAE holidays





Local authorities may add extra holidays

Public holidays are not carried forward if they fall on weekends or overlap with another holiday

Islamic holidays depend on moon sightings, so slight adjustments are possible





Residents of the UAE have much to look forward to in 2026, with several public holidays promising opportunities for long weekends and family time. From Eid celebrations to the National Day, a mix of fixed Gregorian dates and Islamic lunar holidays will shape the holiday calendar. Here is a detailed guide to all predicted public holidays, how they are determined, and tips to plan your time off.UAE public holidays are a combination of fixed Gregorian dates and Islamic lunar calendar dates. Gregorian holidays, such as New Year’s Day and National Day, occur on the same date each year. Islamic holidays, including Eid Al Fitr, Eid Al Adha, Islamic New Year, and Prophet Muhammad’s Birthday (PBUH), shift each year based on moon sightings.The UAE Public Holiday Law, established in April 2024 and implemented from January 2025, allows certain holidays to be shifted to the start or end of the week to create long weekends, except for Eid holidays. Cabinet Resolution No. 27 of 2024 also permits local governments to declare additional holidays for special occasions.Holidays that fall on weekends or coincide with another public holiday are not carried forward, but 2026 predictions indicate no overlap between Islamic holidays and Gregorian holidays.Residents in the UAE can expect at least 12 public holidays in 2026. While final dates depend on moon sightings and government announcements, current predictions give a clear picture of the likely schedule:Transferable holidays: Islamic holidays such as Eid Al Fitr and Eid Al Adha are not transferable. Other holidays, including the Islamic New Year, Prophet’s Birthday, and National Day, may be moved to create long weekends based on Cabinet resolutions.2026 promises several opportunities for extended breaks:Residents are advised to plan ahead, as Islamic holidays depend on moon sightings, which may adjust official dates.Public and private schools in the UAE align their breaks with national holidays, though exact dates differ by curriculum and school authority:This schedule helps families coordinate holidays and make the most of predicted long weekends.Understanding the mix of fixed and lunar based holidays allows residents to strategically plan annual leave. For example, taking just a few days off around Eid or National Day can maximize time away from work. While the UAE government confirms official dates closer to each holiday, these predictions serve as a reliable guide for 2026.Residents should note:With this guide, UAE residents can look forward to a year of well timed breaks, long weekends, and ample family and leisure time.","UAE residents in 2026 can enjoy 12 public holidays, including Eid, National Day, and school breaks.

Disturbing look into the world of Jeffrey Epstein and his island





House Democrats on the Oversight Committee released a new batch of photographs taken inside Jeffrey Epstein ’s private Caribbean island or the famous ""Epstein Island.""The committee said the new images had never been seen publicly before. They were captured on Little St. James in the US Virgin Islands. They include photographs of bedrooms, bathrooms and a room containing a dentist’s chair, with masks displayed on the wall.Another image shows a landline telephone with several first names written next to the speed-dial buttons, partly redacted. A study in one of the photos contains a blackboard with words scrawled across it, including “power,” “deception,” “plots” and “political.”Videos show the exterior grounds of the island home, which resembles a luxury resort. The material also features a swimming pool, palm trees and a long pathway overlooking the sea. Committee Democrats said the redactions in some images were made to remove women’s names for privacy.“These new images are a disturbing look into the world of Jeffrey Epstein and his island. We are releasing these photos and videos to ensure public transparency in our investigation and to help piece together the full picture of Epstein’s horrific crimes,” said Representative Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the committee.The release comes shortly after US President Donald Trump signed a law requiring the Department of Justice (DOJ) to disclose the Epstein-related documents it holds. Those files are expected to be released in the coming days with a lot on line.Epstein privately owned Little St. James and the neighbouring Great St. James. The regions are described as central to his trafficking operation. Victims have detailed how Epstein used the islands to isolate them and host powerful visitors.The islands were sold to billionaire investor Stephen Deckoff in 2023, according to CNN.Investigators are also seeking testimony from Epstein’s former associate and right-hand woman Ghislaine Maxwell , who is serving 20 years in a low-security prison.","House Democrats on the Oversight Committee released a new batch of photographs taken inside Jeffrey Epstein ’s private Caribbean island or the famous ""Epstein Island"" The committee said the new images had never been seen publicly before.

Singapore will require all secondary school students to keep their smartphones and smartwatches locked away for the entire duration of the school day from January 2026, extending an existing restriction that currently applies only during lesson time.The ministry of education (MOE) announced the new rules on November 30, saying they are intended to curb digital distractions and promote healthier screen habits, reported Gulf news.Under the revised policy, students must store devices in lockers or bags not just during classes, but also through recess, co-curricular activities and remedial sessions. Schools may grant exceptions “where necessary,” the ministry said.Citing research on excessive screen exposure, the MOE noted that “screen use among students has been shown to displace important activities such as sleep, physical activity and social interactions.” The ministry added that reducing in-school device dependence is part of a broader effort to improve student wellbeing.Alongside the new restrictions, default ‘sleep hours’ on government-issued learning devices will shift from 11pm to 10.30pm starting January.Parents who have opted out of after-school limits have been urged to adopt the earlier cutoff at home.The move aligns with a growing global push to limit digital distractions in schools. UNESCO estimates that about 40 per cent of education systems now impose smartphone bans. Australia is set to introduce a nationwide bar on social media use for those under 16 next week, while China’s Zhengzhou district requires parents to justify why a child needs a phone “for pedagogical reasons.”The MOE said schools will work closely with parents and reinforce Cyber Wellness education to help students build healthier online habits.","Singapore will require all secondary school students to keep their smartphones and smartwatches locked away for the entire duration of the school day from January 2026.

Who is Luqmaan Khan?







A Pakistan-origin man studying at the University of Delaware was arrested after police discovered a large collection of guns, ammunition and body armour, along with a manifesto that allegedly described plans to ""kill all"" and seek ""martyrdom"" in a mass shooting on the University campus, The New York Post reported.Police arrested 25-year-old Luqmaan Khan just before midnight on November 24. Officers found him sitting in his pickup truck in a park after closing hours, and decided to search the vehicle because he was acting suspiciously.Inside the truck, officers allegedly found a .357 Glock pistol, several loaded 27-round magazines, body-armor plates, binoculars, a laptop and a marble composition notebook. Prosecutors said the pistol had been placed into a kit that turned it into a semi-automatic rifle.The police also recovered a notebook reportedly describing a plan to attack his former school’s campus police department, including a drawn-out map of the police headquarters with marked entry and exit points. The plan included evading law enforcement team after attack.ABC 6 reported that the writings included phrases like “kill all – martyrdom,” explained how to escape after the attack, and described how several weapons would be used.Police said the notes clearly showed “premeditated assault plans” and “warfare techniques.”The exact reason for the planned attack is still unknown, but Khan allegedly told police after his arrest that becoming a martyr was “one of the greatest things you can do.”“This case is a quintessential example of federal and state law enforcement collaborating to neutralize a grave threat to Delaware before the worst could come to pass. I want to thank our dedicated law enforcement partners at the FBI and the NCCPD for their exceptional work. As always, we are proud to work with them to keep Delaware safe,” said Acting US Attorney Murray.One campus police officer was specifically mentioned in the notes, but the reason is not yet known.Police told The Post that Khan was born in Pakistan but has lived in the United States since he was a “youth,” and he is now an American citizen.After his arrest, the FBI searched his home in Wilmington and found even more weapons. Agents recovered an AR-style rifle with a red-dot scope and another Glock pistol, which had an illegal device that turned it into a fully automatic machine gun capable of firing 1,200 rounds per minute.Khan was taken to the New Castle County Police Headquarters and charged with resisting arrest, carrying a concealed deadly weapon, multiple weapon violations and related offenses.He was arraigned, given a $107,200 cash bail, and then handed over to the FBI, which may file additional charges.","Luqmaan Khan, 25, was arrested after police found a large collection of guns, ammunition and body armour in his truck.

Staff at a Virginia liquor store turned up for work on Saturday to find the aftermath of what looked like a small riot: smashed whisky bottles, liquor pooling across the floor and one very drunk raccoon passed out in the bathroom.The Ashland ABC store had been closed for Thanksgiving when it suffered what staff later dubbed a “Black Friday break-in”. When they opened up the next morning, they followed a trail of broken glass and spilled spirits to the lavatory, where the “masked bandit” was found spread-eagled between the toilet and the bin, having apparently helped itself to the bottom shelf.“He fell through one of the ceiling tiles and went on a full-blown rampage, drinking everything,” Samantha Martin, an animal control officer in Hanover County, told the. BBC News reported that among the wreckage was the animal’s apparent drink of choice: scotch.Only one blurry CCTV still exists of the boozy intruder, so no one knows exactly how much it managed to knock back before losing consciousness. Staff called Hanover County Animal Protection and Shelter, and Martin collected the “suspect” for what the shelter jokingly described as questioning.In a Facebook post about the incident, the shelter wrote: “On Saturday morning, Officer Martin responded to an unusual call at the Ashland ABC Store.Upon arrival, she discovered the ‘suspect’ had broken in, ransacked several shelves, and then… passed out in the bathroom. The suspect? A very intoxicated raccoon.”The shelter confirmed the animal was, indeed, drunk, but otherwise unharmed. “After a few hours of sleep and zero signs of injury (other than maybe a hangover and poor life choices), he was safely released back to the wild, hopefully having learned that breaking and entering is not the answer,” the post added. Martin later deadpanned that it was “just another day in the life of an animal control officer”.The Ashland ABC store thanked Hanover County Animal Protection and Shelter on social media for its professionalism and for giving the visitor “a sober ride home”.The Hanover shelter, which looks after rescued and unwanted animals, says on its website : “The shelter provides veterinarian care for homeless or unwanted animals until they are adopted or placed with an animal rescue organization.”Raccoons are, in many ways, built for this kind of misadventure. They’ve adapted so successfully to human environments that researchers are starting to see physical changes associated with early domestication. “Wherever humans go, there is trash,” Dr Raffaela Lesch, a biologist at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, recently told. “Animals love our trash. It’s an easy source of food. All they have to do is endure our presence, not be aggressive, and then they can feast on anything we throw away.”In Ashland, Virginia, one raccoon appears to have taken that principle a step further: skip the bin, go straight for the bar.","The Ashland ABC store had been closed for Thanksgiving when it suffered what staff later dubbed a “Black Friday break-in” When they opened up the next morning, they followed a trail of broken glass and spilled spirits to the lavatory, where the “masked bandit” was found spread-eagled between the toilet and the bin.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125752813,imgsize-1157838,width-400,resizemode-4/drunk-raccoon-middle-aged-recently-divorced-rough-week.jpg"

India’s Growing Imports of Russian Crude Oil

Russia's position in India's oil procurement landscape has seen a substantial shift since the Ukraine conflict. Prior to 2021, Russian supply was minimal, with yearly crude purchases hovering around $2-3 billion, constituting just 1-2% of India's total oil acquisitions.

This scenario altered significantly in 2022, with purchases reaching $25.5 billion, increasing Russia's contribution to approximately 15% of India's crude imports, as sanctions redirected Russian oil towards Asian markets at reduced prices.

The figures escalated in 2023, with imports reaching $48.6 billion, pushing Russia's share to 34.6%, establishing it as India's primary oil supplier, surpassing traditional Gulf sources.

In 2024, the value increased to $52.7 billion, with Russia's portion reaching 37.3% of total crude imports. This three-year transition has fundamentally altered India's energy security considerations and increased its involvement in global oil sanctions politics.

India-Russia: Trade & Defence Dynamics





What will be the outcome of Putin’s India visit?

GTRI envisions two scenarios as outcomes of Putin’s visit to India:

Russian President Vladimir Putin ’s India visit this week is being closely watched by the world - especially to understand what will it mean for India’s trade dynamics with both Russia and the US. Will India bring down its crude oil imports from Russia or look to maintain its autonomy while navigating pressure from US President Donald Trump? The answer is not straightforward - laced in geopolitical, economic and diplomatic issues!Putin is making his first diplomatic visit to India since the conflict in Ukraine started, marking a crucial diplomatic milestone amidst complex geopolitical circumstances. Discounted Russian crude has reshaped India’s energy security but deepened its exposure to sanctions and geopolitical risk, says Ajay Srivastava, founder of Global Trade Research Initiative.The visit occurs at a complex time. India faces continuous US pressure regarding its Russian oil purchases whilst being urged to increase access for American products and defence equipment in its markets.“Putin’s visit is not a nostalgic return to Cold War diplomacy. It is a negotiation over risk, supply chains and economic insulation. A modest outcome will secure oil and defence; an ambitious one will reshape regional economics. The visit is ultimately not about choosing sides—but about managing dependence in a fractured world,” GTRI says.History explains the resilience of the partnership. During the Cold War, the United States backed Pakistan and deployed the USS Enterprise during the 1971 war.The Soviet Union responded with weapons support and diplomatic shielding at the United Nations. Moscow stood by India after its 1962 war with China, provided repeated diplomatic backing over Kashmir, and remained a defence partner after India’s 1998 nuclear tests brought Western sanctions. “ Over decades, Russia transferred strategic technologies the West withheld. Even today, about 60–70% of India’s military platforms remain of Russian origin. The partnership was built in conflict, not commerce,” the think tank says.Also Read | Trump sanctions: India’s crude imports from Russia at 5-month high - can it continue? According to GTRI, India’s current engagement with Russia rests on three pillars—energy, defence and diplomacy. Energy now dominates the relationship.Russia has become India’s largest crude oil supplier, accounting for as much as 30–35% of total oil imports, turning discounted crude into the foundation of the partnership.Defence forms the second pillar. Russia continues to supply and service a majority of India’s frontline platforms—fighter jets, submarines, tanks and air defence systems—and talks continue on maintenance support and future acquisitions.The third pillar is diplomatic coordination through multilaterals including BRICS, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, and the Eastern Economic Forum, alongside cooperation in nuclear power, space exploration, fertilizers and connectivity.Even as India deepens relations with Washington, Brussels and Tokyo, it treats Moscow as essential to its strategic autonomy, notes GTRI.Russia has emerged as India's main oil supplier, making up approximately one-third of total crude imports in 2024. A substantial increase in India's expenditure on Russian oil is evident, rising from $2.3bn in 2021 to $52.7bn in 2024 - a significant shift in energy procurement patterns.Financial sanctions have necessitated alternative payment arrangements. Following Russia's partial SWIFT exclusion, payments now involve multiple currencies: dirhams (60-65%), rupees (25-30%), and yuan (5-10%). Approximately ₹60,000 crore in rupees remain largely unutilised in dedicated Indian accounts. Russian preference has shifted towards UAE dirham settlements, offering better spending and conversion flexibility. Yuan transactions occur periodically. While functional, this arrangement remains susceptible to instability and political pressures.“In energy, New Delhi is expected to pursue long-term crude contracts with Non US sanctioned Russian firms like Lukoil and Roseneft, revival of Indian investments in Russian energy projects, and advancement of nuclear cooperation beyond Kudankulam. Cooperation in critical minerals, manufacturing and maritime connectivity linking India with Russia’s Far East may also be discussed,” says GTRI.Also Read | India’s love for Russian oil continues? State refiners pick non-sanctioned crude at higher discounts; but will Moscow remain top supplier? GTRI points out the defence relationship remains vital, as approximately two-thirds of India's military equipment comes from Russia, linking operational capability to Russian components and modernisation programmes.Indian defence officials plan to request faster delivery of additional S-400 Triumf systems whilst seeking assurances regarding maintenance and upgrades for Russian-origin equipment. Discussions about the Su-57 stealth fighter are anticipated, though primarily as a long-term prospect rather than immediate acquisition.India's exports to Russia stand at approximately $5bn annually, whilst imports, primarily energy-related, reach nearly $64bn. India’s export footprint in Russia is narrow, with pharmaceuticals and machinery strong but garments, electronics and consumer goods negligible. Payments are increasingly de-dollarised, routed through UAE dirhams, rupees and yuan, reflecting the workaround economy created by sanctions, says GTRI.Trade figures between India and Russia show a significant imbalance, with limited export expansion but substantial energy-focused imports. Indian exports increased from $4.3 billion in FY24 to $4.9 billion in FY25, achieving $2.25 billion during April-September 2025.The exports concentrate primarily on industrial and chemical products, with machinery ($367.8 million), pharmaceuticals ($246 million), and organic chemicals ($165.8 million) constituting the main share in FY26's first half. Other sectors show minimal presence: smartphones ($75.9 million), Vannamei shrimp ($75.7 million), meat ($63 million), and garments ($20.94 million), reflecting India's restricted access to Russian consumer markets and electronics sectors despite strategic shifts.Russian imports maintain their dominance, reaching $63.2 billion in FY24 and $63.8 billion in FY25, with April-September 2025 recording $31.2 billion. The import composition heavily features petroleum, specifically crude oil ($23.1 billion) and petroleum products ($2.5 billion), alongside coal ($1.9 billion). Essential imports include fertilisers ($1.3 billion), sunflower seed oil ($633 million), and diamonds ($202 million).This creates an unbalanced trading relationship where India depends on Russia for crucial energy resources and raw materials whilst facing challenges in expanding its value-added exports, creating a trade dynamic susceptible to international commodity price fluctuations.The most likely outcome is a cautious strengthening of existing ties. India could secure firm timelines on defence deliveries, maintenance contracts, and technology upgrades for aircraft, tanks and submarines. Russia, in turn, may lock in long-term energy commitments—including revived Indian equity in LNG fields, multi-year crude supply agreements, and accelerated nuclear plant construction, says GTRI. The two countries may also formalize a new payment framework using the dirham or integrate Russia’s SPFS system with India’s RuPay network. This scenario stabilizes the relationship without significantly raising diplomatic costs, it says.The more ambitious alternative would mark a deeper realignment. “India and Russia could agree on joint production of defence equipment, Indian investment in Russian oil and gas projects such as Arctic LNG 2 or Vostok, and expansion of nuclear cooperation beyond existing reactors,” says the think tank.“Connectivity initiatives like the Chennai–Vladivostok corridor or nodes of the International North–South Transport Corridor could also gain momentum. A structured settlement framework could be unveiled to reduce idle rupee balances. This scenario would reshape India’s Eurasian integration—but potentially provoke sharper Western response,” it adds.“Beyond optics, the summit is about securing fuel, weapons and payments against a world of financial and political fragmentation. For India, the challenge is strategic balance—protecting autonomy while navigating pressure from Washington and dependence on Moscow,” concludes GTRI.",Putin is making his first diplomatic visit to India since the conflict in Ukraine started. India faces continuous US pressure regarding its Russian oil purchases whilst being urged to increase access for American products and defence equipment in its markets. Will India bring down its crude oil imports from Russia or look to maintain its autonomy while navigating pressure from US President Donald Trump?,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125738048,imgsize-97656,width-400,resizemode-4/india-russia-trade.jpg"

A federal grand jury on Thursday rejected prosecutors’ attempt to revive a criminal case against New York Attorney General Letitia James, Reuters reported.The decision came after US District Judge Cameron McGowan Currie threw out an initial set of charges, finding in November that the prosecutor who secured that indictment, Lindsey Halligan, was unlawfully appointed.The indictment would have marked the Justice Department’s second attempt to prosecute James, an elected Democrat and prominent critic of President Donald Trump. Prosecutors plan to seek a new indictment, the two sources added. A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment.Prosecutors rarely struggle to obtain indictments from grand juries, since the govt alone presents evidence and must only show probable cause that a crime was committed. Grand juries have rejected several proposed charges during Trump’s second term, but James is the most high-profile rejection yet.James is one of three high-profile Trump critics hit with federal criminal charges in recent months, along with former FBI Director James Comey and John Bolton, a former Trump national security adviser. Currie also dismissed the case against Comey, ruling that Halligan’s appointment as interim U.S.attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia was impermissible. Bolton pleaded not guilty to federal charges brought in Maryland.James initially pleaded not guilty to charges of bank fraud and lying to a financial institution. The initial indictment accused her of misleading on mortgage documents to secure more favourable loan terms for a home she owns in Norfolk, Virginia.Trump has long assailed James over a civil fraud case she brought against him and his family business, which resulted in a more than Rs 3,735 crore (approx) penalty after a judge found in 2024 that Trump fraudulently overstated his net worth to dupe lenders. A New York state appeals court in August threw out the penalty, which had grown to more than half a billion dollars with interest, but upheld the trial judge’s finding that Trump was liable for fraud.

Musk’s CHILLING Fear EXPOSED: Tesla CEO Confesses He’s Terrified He’ll Be ‘Taken Out’

The numbers involved in the act

How billionaires exploit tax loopholes





Congressman Dan Goldman introduced an initiative targeting the ultra-wealthy, calling it the 'Robinhood' Act, openly targeting Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Amazon co-founder Jeff Bezos.Goldman unveiled the Redistribution of Billions by Instituting New High-Income Obligations on Overlooked Debt (ROBINHOOD) Act, a new federal tax aimed at the ultra-wealthy. The legislation seeks to eliminate a major loophole in the US tax system, which allows billionaires to borrow against assets without paying income tax, generating massive sums while keeping their effective tax rates extremely low.Goldman said that an average New Yorker lives paycheck to paycheck while billionaires hoard large amounts of money. “While working, wage-earning New Yorkers pay income taxes on every single paycheck, billionaires live tax-free by borrowing against their stock portfolios, real estate holdings, and art collections without paying a dime in taxes on that money.""Furthermore, the Congressman claimed that the new bill will generate billions for childcare and working families: “By restoring basic fairness to our tax code and making the ultra-wealthy pay their fair share and contribute what they owe, this bill will generate hundreds of billions of dollars to invest in universal pre-K, child care, and working families instead of subsidising billionaires’ yachts and private islands.It’s long past time for the wealthiest people in the country to pay their fair share.”The ROBINHOOD Act proposes a 20% excise tax on loans and lines of credit backed by capital assets for individuals earning over $400,000 a year, or $450,000 for joint filers. The tax would apply to personal financial investments including stocks, bonds, private equity, real estate, digital assets, and collectibles, while exempting home mortgages, home equity loans, and farmland credit.The bill could generate at least $276 billion over 10 years, according to GoldmanA 2021 ProPublica investigation showed that America’s 25 richest individuals paid an average effective tax rate of just 3.4%, far below the top federal income tax bracket. Elon Musk paid 3.3%, Jeff Bezos 1%, and Warren Buffett just 0.1%.One common strategy called the “Borrow, Buy, Die” allows the ultra-wealthy to borrow against appreciating assets rather than sell them and pay capital gains tax. In 2022, Elon Musk had pledged $94 billion in Tesla shares as collateral for personal loans, while the next richest 1% collectively borrowed over $1 trillion in the same year.","Congressman Dan Goldman introduced the 'Robinhood' Act, a new federal tax aimed at the ultra-wealthy.

$500,000 reward and dead ends

The arrest





After 5 years of a manhunt, federal authorities finally arrested Brian Cole, the man accused of placing pipe bombs near the Democratic and Republican National Committee offices the night before the Jan 6 Capitol riot. Cole was living in Woodbridge, Virginia, before he was taken into custody.On the evening of 5 January 2021, Cole allegedly placed two homemade pipe bombs near the DNC and RNC headquarters. The devices were made from 1×8‑inch galvanized metal pipes, filled with homemade black powder, and fitted with a kitchen timer for detonation. Neither device exploded, but officials described them as capable of causing serious injury or death.Surveillance footage captured the suspect wearing Nike shoes, a dark hoodie, and glasses, reportedly carrying a backpack containing the bombs. The devices were later found and safely recovered by the FBI.For almost five years, authorities struggled to identify the individual in the grainy, low-quality surveillance images. Investigators reviewed tens of thousands of video files, interviewed hundreds of witnesses, and analysed digital and geolocation data to determine where the suspect actually went after planting the bombs.A $500,000 reward was issued to any person who would provide helpful details about the criminal. But it was all for nothing.Lawmakers questioned how security failures allowed the bombs to remain undetected for nearly 17 hours. The FBI continued to release updated video footage and physical descriptions, estimating the suspect at around 5′7″ tall.The breakthrough came in December 2025, when investigators were able to link new forensic evidence and video analysis to Brian Cole. Authorities executed a warrant at his home in Woodbridge, taking him into custody without incident. Formal charges have not yet been publicly released, but officials confirmed the arrest closes one of the longest-running mysteries tied to the January 6 riots.","Brian Cole was living in Woodbridge, Virginia, before he was taken into custody.

Heartburn For Trump As Modi-Putin Mega ‘Stunt’ Vexes US; India BOLDY 'Defies' US 'Diktat'





In a move that deepens the environmental divide between the United States and much of the world—particularly fast-growing green economies such as China and India—US President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced a sweeping rollback of American fuel-economy standards. The decision, experts say, effectively shifts a significant portion of the global decarbonisation burden onto other nations at a time when developing countries are accelerating the transition to electric mobility and renewable energy.At a White House meeting flanked by the CEOs of Ford and Stellantis, Trump dismissed longstanding US climate commitments under the Obama and Biden administrations as a “green new scam” and slashed Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) targets from 50.4 miles per gallon (mpg) by 2031 to just 34.5 mpg—returning to levels last seen in 2022. The rollback builds on the earlier Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient (SAFE) Vehicles Rule, which had already replaced Obama-era efficiency gains of roughly 5% annually with a lenient 1.5% requirement.Analysts warn the regulatory retreat locks the US into greater petroleum dependence throughout the next decade, ensuring American drivers consume billions of additional barrels of oil and emit hundreds of millions of tonnes of avoidable carbon dioxide.This stands in sharp contrast, they note, to rapid clean-energy transitions underway across Asia, where developing economies are outpacing the US in electric-vehicle production, adoption and renewable-energy deployment.Trump framed the rollback as a win for workers and consumers, calling previous standards “ridiculously burdensome” and costly. Backed by automakers that have lagged in the global EV race, the administration argued that stringent rules forced companies to integrate expensive technologies, raising sticker prices for new cars. By easing compliance, the White House said, automakers would be able to offer cheaper, newer and safer fuel-powered vehicles.The administration also cast older standards as part of what it claimed was an overzealous national push toward electric vehicles. “It’s a quest to end the gasoline-powered car,” Trump said, hailing the reversal as a repudiation of the “Green New Scam.”For China and India, the US decision is both a geopolitical setback and a source of frustration. Between them, the two countries—home to nearly a third of the global population—have made major strides in renewable expansion and electrified transport, often surpassing expectations under the Paris Agreement.China remains the world’s undisputed EV leader, whupping U.S in the field despite Elon Musk's effort. It sold more than 11 million electric vehicles in 2024—a 40% surge—with 2025 projections showing EV sales poised to overtake internal combustion engines for the first time. The country added 510 gigawatts of renewable capacity in 2024 alone, while wind and solar generation climbed to 2,073 terawatt-hours as of mid-2025. China invested $625 billion in clean energy in 2024—31% of the global total—achieving its 2030 renewable targets six years early.India, on its part, is expanding renewables at an even faster clip than China. With annual clean-energy growth of 16%, New Delhi is on track to double renewable capacity to about 360–380 GW by 2030. It added 17 GW of solar capacity last year and is pushing toward a 500 GW non-fossil target. EV sales crossed two million units in 2024, largely driven by two-wheelers that are helping cut pollution in cities such as New Delhi, which again made international headlines this week for hazardous air quality.Globally, the US reversal is widely viewed as climate indulgence—prioritising short-term domestic cost savings over long-term planetary stability. Even within the US, several states criticised the move. Washington State Senator Maria Cantwell called it “short-sighted,” warning it would worsen pollution, undermine public health and stall job growth in clean-tech industries.Analysts say the rollback sends a clear geopolitical signal: by resisting domestic climate action, Washington is effectively shifting a disproportionate share of global emissions-reduction responsibility onto developing nations that are already bearing the brunt of climate-related disasters. For countries balancing economic growth with severe pollution challenges, the US stance is viewed as strategic abandonment by the world’s largest historical emitter—one that risks widening the global climate gap at a critical moment.","US President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced a sweeping rollback of American fuel-economy standards.

The family of a Colombian fisherman killed in a US strike in the Caribbean has filed a formal complaint against such attacks with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights.The petition was filed on Tuesday by US human rights lawyer Dan Kovalik. It alleges that Alejandro Carranza was killed when the United States struck his boat off the coast of Colombia on September 15. Kovalik told CNN that the family seeks compensation and an end to similar killings: “These killings are against international law. They are against US law. We want this to stop, and we think this is at least a first step to having that happen.”The complaint names US secretary of defence Pete Hegseth as responsible for ordering the bombing of boats like Carranza’s and claimed that his conduct was ratified by US President Donald Trump.Since early September, US has carried out at least 22 strikes on alleged drug trafficking boats in the Caribbean and Pacific, killing at least 83 people. The US maintains the strikes comply with the Law of Armed Conflict and has said the boats were linked to armed drug cartels. Trump claimed that the September 15 strike killed three “narcoterrorists from Venezuela” transporting drugs to the United States.However, Kovalik says Carranza was simply fishing for marlin and tuna when he was killed. “That is what he was doing. That was his profession and his vocation.” Colombian President Gustavo Petro has described Carranza as a lifelong fisherman with no ties to the drug trade. He added that Carranza may have occasionally carried prohibited goods due to financial pressures, but ""his actions don't deserve the death penalty. ”Kovalik has also represented President Petro, who was sanctioned by the US on October 24 over alleged involvement in the global drug trade. Petro has denied the allegations.",The family of a Colombian fisherman killed in a US strike in the Caribbean has filed a formal complaint.

Donald Trump's Stricter H-1B Visa Rule Hits Indian Talent, Background Check Screening Expanded





In a significant tightening of America’s visa-vetting system, the US State Department has announced late on Wednesday night, that all H-1B workers and their H-4 dependents will undergo mandatory social-media screening from Dec 15. Applicants will have to switch their social-media accounts to “public” settings to enable scrutiny.Immigration experts say the move marks a major expansion of Washington’s digital-footprint policy. Mitch Wexler, senior counsellor at global immigration law firm Fragomen, said, “An online presence review has been in place for F, M and J visa applicants (students and exchange visitors) since late June 2025; expansion to include the H-1B and H-4 categories is the first ramp-up of the policy.” He adds that, applicants should expect far more intensive review of their posts, interactions and overall digital activity.According to the State Department, consular officers will review an applicant’s social-media profiles, public posts and information available across online platforms and databases. The Department reiterated that “every visa adjudication is a national security decision” and stressed that a US visa is “a privilege, not a right”.Internal guidance circulated in June for student visas suggests the parameters officers may rely on. Negative inferences can be drawn if applicants keep portions of their accounts private or have no online presence at all. Officers are also expected to evaluate whether any content reflects hostility toward US citizens, institutions or culture; support for designated terror groups; attempts to access or misuse sensitive US technology; or a pattern of political activism that could continue after entering the US. Derogatory or questionable material can lead to follow-up interviews, prolonged background checks or visa refusal.Wexler warns that the expanded checks will increase the burden on consulates. “The vetting standards also mean that applicants may face an increased likelihood of being flagged for lengthy background checks and longer waits for visa issuance. These factors could mean that H-1B and H-4 visa applicants are delayed in their ability to enter the US.” This will be a concern for Indians, especially IT professionals, who form the largest H-1B cohort. USCIS data shows that in fiscal year 2024, Indians led all nationalities, securing about 80,500 new H-1B visas, followed by China with just 19,600 such visas.The latest expansion follows a series of measures over the past year that brought digital behaviours to the forefront of visa screening. When similar rules were introduced for student and exchange-visitor visas, interviews were briefly paused while consulates implemented new screening protocols, prompting concerns about vague ‘hostility indicators’ and inconsistent interpretations.The heightened scrutiny also comes amid a broader debate in the US over online speech. According to Reuters a recent internal cable sent to all U.S. missions on December 2, orders US consular officers to review resumes or LinkedIn profiles of H-1B applicants - and family members who would be traveling with them - to see if they have worked in areas that include activities such as misinformation, disinformation, content moderation, fact-checking, compliance and online safety, among others.""If you uncover evidence an applicant was responsible for, or complicit in, censorship or attempted censorship of protected expression in the United States, you should pursue a finding that the applicant is ineligible,"" under a specific article of the Immigration and Nationality Act, the cable said.Rajiv S. Khanna, managing attorney at Immigration.com expressed dismay that a country which professes to be a shining beacon of free speech does not appreciate it. Cyrus D. Mehta, immigration attorney, told TOI that, “ The policy to punish H-1B holders who have been involved in censorship in the tech sector appears to be hypocritical. The Trump administration will deny a visa benefit if you (say as an executive in a social media company), have censored a person or viewpoint they favour - however politically incorrect, hurtful or obnoxious it may be. On the other hand, the Trump administration will have no compunctions to punish you if you have expressed views that they disfavor such as views perceived to be anti-Americanism even if it is protected under the First Amendment.”",All H-1B workers and their H-4 dependents will undergo mandatory social-media screening from Dec 15. Applicants will have to switch their social- media accounts to ‘public’ settings to enable scrutiny.

When asked if he would seek to speak to Mamdani, he said: “If he changes his mind and says that we have the right to exist, that'll be a good opening for a conversation.”Democratic Socialist Mamdani is set to become New York's first Muslim and first South Asian mayor. He is a staunch pro-Palestinian who has advocated free Gaza and even accused the Israeli defence forces of committing war crimes, genocide.

Pakistan Army General Warns Of Hybrid-To-Full War As Pakistan Reshapes Military Power Under Munir





President Asif Ali Zardari on Thursday formally appointed Army Chief Field Marshal Asim Munir as Pakistan’s first Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) for a period of five years.The move follows the recent passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment on November 12, which created the post of CDF to unify command across the armed forces and streamline decision-making during critical situations.The newly created CDF replaces the abolished office of the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC), which formally ended on November 27 following the retirement of General Sahir Shamshad Mirza.President Zardari approved the recommendation submitted by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif for Munir’s appointment. A press release from the President’s office extended best wishes to Munir in his new role.The same release also announced a two-year extension in the service of Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmad Babar Sidhu, Chief of Air Staff, effective from the completion of his current tenure in March 2026.Law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said the reforms “bring constitutional oversight to defence appointments while maintaining military honour and tradition” and confirmed there were no legal or political obstacles to Munir’s appointment. He also stated that the Defence Ministry was preparing a new organogram for the CDF to reflect the changes.Field Marshal Munir, who was initially appointed as COAS in November 2022 for three years, had his tenure extended to five years in 2024.With this appointment, he assumes a historic dual role, serving simultaneously as Chief of Army Staff and the first Chief of Defence Forces, marking a significant shift in Pakistan’s military hierarchy and institutional structure.The 27th Constitutional Amendment elevates the army chief to the role of CDF with constitutional authority over all three branches of the military: army, navy and air force.It also introduces judicial reforms, including the creation of a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) to handle constitutional matters, allowing the Supreme Court to focus on civil and criminal cases.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif welcomed the amendment as a demonstration of national unity, highlighting the role of law enforcement in recent counterterrorism efforts.While the ruling coalition including PPP, PML-N, and MQM-P, supported the amendment, opposition parties criticized it as unconstitutional, warning it could concentrate excessive power in the military.PTI chairman Gohar Ali Khan described it as the “Baku Amendments,” accusing the government of undermining democracy. PPP Senator Raza Rabbani warned the changes could damage provincial autonomy and roll back powers devolved under the 18th Amendment, according to Dawn.Following Munir’s appointment, the next key step will be appointing the commander of the National Strategic Command (NSC), a four-star position previously under the CJCSC. The NSC commander will be appointed by the prime minister on the recommendation of the CDF.",President Asif Ali Zardari formally appoints Asim Munir as Pakistan's first Chief of Defence Forces. The appointment follows the recent passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment. The post of CDF unifies command across the armed forces and streamline decision-making during critical situations.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125772050,imgsize-464797,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

'Munir Is A Mentally Unstable Man': Ex-Pakistan PM Imran Khan Blames Army Chief of Fueling Terrorism





Pakistan’s jailed former prime minister Imran Khan on Wednesday launched a sharp attack on the country’s army chief and de-facto ruler Asim Munir , calling him a ""mentally unstable man."" He also claimed that field marshal Munir’s policies were ""disastrous"" for Pakistan and accused him of intentionally ""igniting tensions"" with Afghanistan.The 73-year-old former cricketer-turned-politician shared these remarks on social media a day after his sister, Dr Uzma Khan, met him in Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail. The meeting took place after more than a month, following “special permission” from Shehbaz Sharif ’s government, amid widespread rumours on social media about Imran’s health and safety after he was placed in solitary confinement.In a post on X written in Urdu, Khan said, “Asim Munir’s policies are disastrous for Pakistan. Because of his policies, terrorism has spiralled out of control that grieves me deeply.”He further alleged, “Asim Munir has no concern for Pakistan’s national interests. He is doing all this merely to please Western powers. He deliberately ignited tensions with Afghanistan so that he could be seen internationally as a so-called 'mujahid'.”The PTI founder said he had always opposed “drone attacks and military operations against own people in the country which he said would only fuel more terrorism.”He claimed, “Munir first threatened Afghans, then expelled refugees from Pakistan and carried out drone strikes whose consequences we now face in the form of rising terrorism.”Calling Munir a “mentally unstable man,” Khan alleged that the army chief’s “moral bankruptcy has led to the complete collapse of the Constitution and rule of law in Pakistan.”He also accused Munir of being behind the cases against him and his wife, saying they had been “imprisoned in fabricated cases and subjected to the worst form of psychological torture.”Khan described his prison conditions, saying, “I have been kept in complete solitary confinement, locked inside a cell with no contact with a single human being for four weeks. I was kept entirely cut off from the outside world, and even the basic necessities guaranteed under the jail manual have been taken away from us.”He added that despite court orders, his meetings with political colleagues were stopped, and now even his access to lawyers and family had been cut off. “Pick up any human rights charter, psychological torture is considered 'torture' and is deemed even more severe than physical torture. My sister Noreen Niazi was dragged on the road simply for demanding her legitimate right to meet me,” he said.Khan praised Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Sohail Afridi for showing courage during what he called an “environment of repression.” He wrote, “I ask him to continue to play on the front foot. There is no law or Constitution in this country. The law is enforced only against PTI as everyone else is exempt. Those threatening governor’s rule in KP should impose it today rather than tomorrow and then watch what happens to them. ”Speculation about Khan’s health had grown after an undeclared ban was imposed on meeting him. Uzma, after seeing her brother, said his health was “perfectly fine” but he was being subjected to “mental torture in solitary confinement.”“Praise be to Allah! His health is perfectly fine. However, he was very angry and said that they are subjecting him to mental torture,” she said.","Imran Khan says Asim Munir's policies are ""disastrous"" for Pakistan.

Pakistan will hold bidding on December 23 to sell its state-owned carrier, Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), state media reported on Wednesday.The loss-making airline is being privatised as part of a $7 billion International Monetary Fund (IMF) program , which requires the federal government to reform or divest struggling state enterprises. A previous attempt to offload PIA last year was scrapped after the government failed to receive a sufficiently attractive offer.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met with corporate entities and company representatives involved in the process, according to a press release shared by state broadcaster PTV News. “PIA’s bidding will take place on December 23, which will be broadcast live on all media. We are ensuring transparency and merit in the privatisation process,” the statement quoted him as saying.Sharif said the process was proceeding “smoothly” and argued that privatisation would help restore the airline’s “lost prestige,” align it with modern aviation requirements and facilitate the restoration of PIA’s global flight operations — a step he said was crucial for overseas Pakistanis.If completed, the transaction would mark Pakistan’s first major privatisation in nearly two decades.Founded in October 1946, PIA is based at Karachi’s Jinnah International Airport, the country’s second-busiest airport and its largest city’s main aviation hub.","Pakistan will hold bidding on December 23 to sell its state-owned carrier, Pakistan International Airlines.

NEW DELHI: Imran Khan’s sister on Tuesday said the former Pakistan prime minister is “completely fine” and in good health, after she was finally allowed to meet him inside Adiala Jail following weeks of restricted access that had fuelled protests and rumours about his condition.Authorities at Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail permitted Imran’s sister Uzma Khanum to meet him on Tuesday, breaking a prolonged period during which family members and PTI leaders were repeatedly denied access. According to Pakistan news outlet Dawn, Uzma entered the prison as several PTI supporters gathered outside demanding transparency on Imran’s health.Following the meeting, PTI USA shared her remarks, quoting her as saying, “Imran Khan’s health is perfectly fine. However, he said that they are subjecting him to mental torture, and that Asim Munir is responsible for all of this.”AccordingUzma said that Imran Khan was kept in his room throughout the day, allowed only limited time outside, and had no communication with anyone.

There has been absolutely no contact with Pakistan’s former Prime Minister Imran Khan , which has intensified speculation about his possible death. Demanding access to the PTI founder, party members have decided to stage a protest despite the restrictions imposed by the Pakistan government.Following the PTI workers' announcement of protests outside the Islamabad High Court and Adiala Jail, Section 144 was enforced in both cities. However, the order has not deterred Imran Khan’s supporters. They declared their protest plans even as restrictions have been in place since November 18 for two months.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi on Sunday declared that the party would stage a major protest outside the Islamabad High Court on Monday, followed by another demonstration outside Adiala Jail on Tuesday. Speaking at a press conference at the CM House, Afridi claimed that Imran Khan, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder, has been held in “complete isolation” since November 4, with no one granted access to him.He said that Khan’s sisters, senior party leaders, lawyers, and even doctors have all been barred from meeting him, effectively placing him in total solitary confinement—a situation he described as “extremely alarming.”PTI leaders have been demanding access to the party founder, Imran Khan. After KP CM Afridi ordered the party members to immediately move to Islamabad, the party has also asked the supporters to gather outside the Adiala Jail later.Talking to reporters, Afridi said that on Tuesday, all parliamentarians would first gather at the IHC to stage a strong protest before the court’s chief justice, noting that despite judicial orders, he himself was not allowed to meet Khan.“This is blatant contempt of court. We will hold a protest at the IHC,” Afridi asserted.He said the parliamentarians would then move to Adiala Jail to attempt to meet Khan and to express solidarity with his sisters.Following the announcement of protests, the Rawalpindi deputy commissioner's office issued the notice on Monday that Section 144 shall be imposed in the city from December 1 to December 3. According to the notice, the order has been enforced on the basis of “imminent threats” identified by the district intelligence committee (DIC), particularly in and around sensitive installations, major roads and other critical infrastructure. The committee’s assessment underpinned the local government’s decision to restrict public gatherings during this period.The Rawalpindi notification prohibits all kinds of gatherings of more than five people. As per the statement, ""All kinds of Assemblies, Gatherings, Sits-in, Rallies, Processions, Demonstrations, Jalsas, Dharnas, Protests and such like other activities, i.e gathering of 05 or more persons.""""Carrying of weapons, spikes, laden batons, gaulails, ball bearings, petrol bombs, improvised explosives or any other instrument that could potentially be used for violence,"" is also listed as one of the restrictions in the notice.Along with these, pillion riding and the use of loudspeakers or display of ""arms and hatred speeches"" are also prohibited.The Islamabad district magistrate’s office issued the order after what it described as “certain segments of society … planning to organise unlawful assemblies … within the jurisdiction of Islamabad Capital Territory,” according to a report in Dawn. The announcement in Rawalpindi came through a notification from the deputy commissioner’s office, which cited security concerns due to potential large gatherings.In Islamabad, the order did not define what would constitute an “unlawful assembly” but noted that authorities deemed it “necessary to control such types of illegal activities which present a threat to public peace, tranquillity and maintenance of law & order.”Pakistan’s former Prime Minister has remained completely out of sight for more than six weeks, with neither his party members nor his family able to establish any direct contact during this period. His prolonged absence from public view has intensified anxiety across the country, fuelling widespread speculation and deepening fears about his safety.The lack of verified updates or appearances has further heightened concerns, with many questioning whether the politician-turned-cricketer may have become the target of a possible assassination attempt or is otherwise being kept in undisclosed conditions.Khan’s sons fear authorities may be hiding “something irreversible” about his condition. His son, Kasim Khan, told Reuters that the family has had no direct or verifiable contact with the jailed former Prime Minister, despite a court order allowing weekly meetings.“Not knowing whether your father is safe, harmed, or even alive is psychological torture,” he said, noting that there has been no independently confirmed communication for months.“We have no reliable information about his condition,” he added. “Our deepest fear is that something irreversible is being kept from us.”Khan’s sister, Aleema Khan, filed a contempt of court petition in the IHC on November 28 against the Adiala Jail superintendent and other officials, alleging they prevented her from meeting her brother.Submitting the petition in the presence of Chief Minister Afridi, she cited the IHC’s March 24 order, which had restored a twice-weekly visitation schedule for the 73-year-old former prime minister.Pakistan government officials have rejected rumours that Imran Khan has died in custody or been quietly moved out of Adiala Jail, insisting he remains inside the Rawalpindi facility and is in stable condition.“There is no truth to claims of his transfer from Adiala Jail. He is in good health and receiving full medical care,” Geo News quoted Rawalpindi prison officials as saying.Imran Khan is currently being held in Adiala Jail, where a court first handed him a three-year prison term in August 2023 in the Al-Qadir Trust case. Since then, successive corruption convictions have pushed his total sentence to 14 years, the longest jail term imposed on him so far.","Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leaders have been demanding access to the party founder, Imran Khan. KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi claimed that Imran Khan has been held in “complete isolation” since November 4. Khan’s sisters, senior party leaders, lawyers, and even doctors have all been barred from meeting him.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125710838,imgsize-1508415,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

In a first, the Baloch Liberation Front (BLF) used a woman fidayeen operative to storm a heavily-guarded complex belonging to the Frontier Corps and housing a Chinese copper and gold mining project center located in Chagai, Balochistan. Six Pak personnel were reportedly killed in Sunday evening’s attack but there was no official word from the Pak authorities.The BLF also released the photo of the bomber, Zareena Rafiq aka Trang Mahoo, who detonated herself at the barrier to allow the rebel fighters to breach the main compound. The attack is significant because it is the first time the BLF has used a suicide bomber, a tactic exclusive to Majeed Brigade of the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) which has carried out a series of attacks including the Jaffar Express hijack in the region.The fact that the complex was linked to the Saindak and Reko Diq projects, managed by Chinese companies and a Canadian firm, indicates the change in rebels’ strategy to strike high-value assets with geopolitical significance, sources said. In a statement released on Telegram, the BLF spokesperson Gwahram Baloch said that the Fidayeen operation was carried out by its ‘selfsacrifice’ unit, Saddo Operational Battalion (SOB), named after Martyred Commander Waja Sado aka Sadath Marri.Meanwhile the BLA released a statement on the wave of coordinated attacks carried out at multiple locations between Nov 28-29, claiming 27 Pak army personnel were killed in 29 attacks. The BLA also said it had taken control of motorways and seized weapons.BLA fighters struck the Pakistani army’s Coast Guard camp in the Pasni area of Gwadar with multiple grenade launchers. They targeted military intelligence personnel in the Jiwani area of Gwadar with a remote-controlled IED attack while they were returning after extorting money from vehicles, the BLA said. Another attack was on the residence of a Pakistani army major in Mastung city.Six blasts were reported at defence installations in Quetta as well. Meanwhile, state forces and bomb disposal squad personnel attempting to advance towards the sites were targeted in another attack resulting in further casualties.",Baloch Liberation Front (BLF) used a woman fidayeen operative to storm a heavily-guarded complex belonging to the Frontier Corps.

Author and National Security Advisory Board (NSAB) member Tilak Devasher claimed that Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is “intentionally” staying out of the country to avoid being present when the notification would be issued for the appointment of the first-ever Chief of Defence Forces (CDF).Created through the 27th amendment to Pakistan’s constitution, the post is set to be assumed by Field Marshal Asim Munir, potentially making him the most powerful army chief in the country’s history.Speaking to ANI, Devasher highlighted that Sharif left for Bahrain and then London, leading to speculation that he's ""deliberately"" staying away to avoid issuing the notification.“Very smartly, the Pakistan PM went to Bahrain and then to London. He clearly does not want to issue the notification giving Asim Munir five years as army chief and as Chief of Defence Forces. He seems to believe that by staying away and avoiding signing the notification, he can escape the consequences,” said Devasher, author of four books on Pakistan.The comment comes after Sharif’s government failed to issue the required notification appointing Munir as the first-ever CDF by the November 29 deadline—the day his original three-year term as army chief ended.With the creation of the CDF post, the office of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee has formally been abolished.Devasher added that Pakistan is currently navigating a “very messy” situation.“If it turns out that he (Asim Munir) is no longer the army chief, then Pakistan finds itself without an army chief, and even the nuclear command authority—meant to fall under the new Strategic Forces Command—is effectively leaderless. It’s an extremely strange situation,” he remarked.Legal experts remain divided over whether the notification is necessary. Under the amended Constitution, the Chief of Army Staff’s term is meant to run concurrently with the CDF, lasting five years.Some analysts, however, argue that the issue may already be addressed by the Pakistan Army Act’s 2024 amendment, which extended the tenure of service chiefs to five years, according to Dawn. The amendment includes a “deeming” clause stating it “shall always be deemed to have been part of the Pakistan Army Act,” implying that Munir’s current term could automatically extend from three to five years without any additional notification.Devasher, however, called this interpretation “controversial,” questioning the view that a notification may not be required.“Some people argue that the Army Act was amended in 2004, setting the army chief’s tenure at five years. Since he has already served three, he supposedly has another two years remaining. From this perspective, no new notification would be required. This is controversial, and it’s unclear how the judiciary or the government will view it. But the fact remains that it makes his position very tenuous,” Devasher said.He also pointed to what he described as political manoeuvring within the military. “There are reports that other generals are now jostling for the position of army chief or for the two newly created four-star posts,” he stated.Devasher added that Prime Minister Sharif’s absence is only deepening the uncertainty. “But this situation cannot continue,” he warned. “A nuclear-armed country cannot function without a Chief of the Army Staff or someone in charge of the nuclear command authority.”","Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is ""intentionally"" staying out of the country to avoid being present when the notification would be issued for the appointment of the first-ever Chief of Defence Forces.

Pakistan Army General Warns Of Hybrid-To-Full War As Pakistan Reshapes Military Power Under Munir





Fresh violence broke out in Pakistan after a suicide bomber detonated himself at the main gate of the Frontier Corps (FC) headquarters in Nokkundi, Balochistan, sparking an intense exchange of fire and a major security response, Dawn reported.The attack, claimed to be the work of militants described by officials as Fitna-al-Khawarij — the state’s term for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) — triggered a swift retaliatory operation in which three attackers were killed.According to FC Balochistan South, the assault began when a suicide bomber blew himself up at the entrance, allowing several armed militants to force their way into the compound. Security personnel from the quick response force immediately engaged the attackers, with heavy gunfire reported from the area. Officials said at least six gunmen were believed to have entered the headquarters, prompting a full-scale clearance operation that continued through the day.In a statement, the FC spokesperson said troops were determined to neutralise the remaining threat, adding that the “last of the terrorists will also be” dealt with.Local reports described sustained firing inside the headquarters as forces worked room-to-room to secure the facility.The incident comes just days after a similar assault on an FC compound in the northwestern city of Peshawar, where gunmen and two suicide bombers stormed a paramilitary headquarters, killing three people. Police had said the first bomber detonated at the main entrance while the second entered the compound, forcing law enforcement to cordon off the busy FC Chowk area amid multiple explosions.These attacks form part of a broader escalation in militant violence this year. Earlier attacks in Quetta — including a deadly car bomb outside a paramilitary base and a suicide blast at a political rally — have added to growing instability in Balochistan. The province has endured a long-running insurgency, with hundreds of security personnel killed in 2024 alone, alongside attacks claimed by separatist groups such as the Baloch Liberation Army.","Suicide bomber detonates himself at the main gate of the Frontier Corps (FC) headquarters in Nokkundi, Balochistan.

At least seven explosions were reported in Pakistan’s Balochistan province over the past 24 hours, with suspected insurgents targeting sites in Quetta and Dera Murad Jamali. No casualties were reported, although two security guards with a construction company were injured in the attacks.The incidents triggered fear and panic in the provincial capital.On Saturday, insurgents hurled hand grenades at a police checkpoint in Quetta, followed by the detonation of an IED near an Anti-Terrorism Department vehicle. Three additional explosions took place later in the evening, as cited by PTI.Senior Superintendent of Police Asif Khan said the blast near Lohr Karez, on the outskirts of Quetta, damaged the main line connecting the city with other parts of the country.SSP Khan said the attackers had planted IEDs on a railway track and detonated them as a train was scheduled to arrive at Quetta station. The blast damaged the track and forced the suspension of rail services.Khan added that armed men also attacked a construction company site on Quetta’s Sariab Road with hand grenades, damaging machinery and injuring two security guards. In another incident, motorcycle-borne insurgents hurled two hand grenades at the Manzoor Shaheed police station, one of which exploded while the other was defused by a bomb disposal squad.In Dera Murad Jamali, a patrolling police vehicle was targeted with hand grenades.Attackers also threw hand grenades in the Kech Beg area near a police patrol post in Quetta.No group immediately claimed responsibility for Saturday’s attacks, but insurgent activity resumed on Sunday morning.Earlier this year, at least ten people were killed and several others injured when a powerful car bomb exploded outside the paramilitary headquarters in Quetta.On September 3, a suicide bombing at a political rally in the city killed 11 people and wounded more than 40, targeting a stadium parking area where hundreds of Balochistan National Party supporters had gathered.Pakistani forces continue to battle a longstanding insurgency in Balochistan, which has claimed 782 lives in 2024. In March, the Baloch Liberation Army hijacked a train and killed off-duty troops. Since January, more than 430 people, most of them security personnel, have been killed in various attacks, including six soldiers in Bannu.","At least seven explosions reported in Pakistan's Balochistan province over the past 24 hours.

Brazening it out, Pakistan on Sunday dismissed UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk’s concerns over the country’s recent 27th constitutional amendment, urging him to avoid remarks that reflect “political bias and misinformation. ”“Like all parliamentary democracies, all legislation as well as any amendment to the constitution remain the exclusive domain of the elected representatives of the people of Pakistan. While Pakistan gives due importance to the work of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, it is regrettable that Pakistan's views and ground realities were not reflected in the statement issued,” the Foreign Office (FO) said in a statement.The FO added that Pakistan remains “fully committed to protecting, promoting and upholding human rights, human dignity, basic freedoms and the rule of law as enshrined in the constitution”.“It is regrettable that Pakistan's views and ground realities were not reflected in the remarks. We urge the High Commissioner to respect the sovereign decisions of Pakistan's parliament and avoid commentary that reflects political bias and misinformation,"" it stated.In a statement on Friday, Türk criticised Islamabad for adopting the amendment without “broad consultation” with legal experts and civil society, warning that the “hastily adopted” changes could undermine judicial independence and raise questions about military accountability.The 27th amendment has stirred intense political debate within the neighbouring nation. On November 12, a joint parliamentary committee of the Senate and National Assembly approved the bill , prompting the opposition to warn that the government was sounding “the death knell for the Supreme Court”.The amendment alters Article 243 by abolishing the post of Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC) and replacing it with a new Chief of Defence Forces (CDF). It also proposes establishing a Federal Constitutional Court and reducing certain powers of the Supreme Court.The first CDF will be Asim Munir, the Pakistan Army chief who was “promoted” to the five-star Field Marshal rank following the conflict with India in May.According to Dawn, the Pakistan government is yet to notify the appointment of the CDF, even as the office of the CJCSC formally ended on Thursday.",Pakistan dismisses UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk's concerns over the country’s recent 27th constitutional amendment.

Imran Khan Isolation Sparks Fury As PTI Claims His Photo Could Transform Pak’s Political Reality

What the rules say about ‘political prisoner’ access





This raises a critical question: what does the jail manual actually say?

Meetings with five people per week, including lawyers and relatives

30 minutes of phone time weekly

Rules that are ‘subjective’





Family’s repeated requests denied









Former Pakistan prime minister and World Cup–winning captain Imran Khan has been in jail for over two years. In recent days, rumours about his health, and even claims that he may have died, have spread widely on social media. His family says they are worried because they have not been allowed to meet him for weeks.The anxiety deepened on Friday when Imran Khan’s son Kasim Khan publicly demanded that the government prove the 73-year-old PTI founder is alive.""We demand proof of Imran Khan's life,"" Kasim said in a social media post.For nearly a month, no family member, lawyer or party aide has been allowed to see the former cricketer-turned-politician, fuelling speculation that he may have been harmed inside Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail, where he has been incarcerated for over two years.According to Dawn, while the government maintains that Imran Khan is being given all ""possible facilities"", a senior cabinet member on Friday claimed that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Sohail Afridi was trying to meet Khan in violation of the jail manual.Information minister Atta Tarar’s remarks triggered a sharp response from the PTI, which insists its court-approved visiting schedule — Tuesdays and Thursdays — is not being honoured.Dawn reports that visitation and phone calls are tied to a prisoner’s ""good behaviour"", giving the jail superintendent wide discretion.As the newspaper notes: ""Visitation, phone calls allowed to prisoners are linked to their ‘good behaviour’, meaning the jail superintendent has the discretion to allow or disallow meetings.""Current and former prison officials told Dawn that prisoners in Punjab, including political detainees, are allowed:Even condemned prisoners can meet family and lawyers once a week and get the same phone allowance via public call offices inside Adiala Jail.Political prisoners, Dawn adds, are placed in special cells under strict security, with daily medical check-ups mandated to ensure they are healthy.But these rules are not absolute. Their implementation depends heavily on the inmate’s behaviour, making the process ""necessarily subjective"", according to Dawn.Serious charges -- including terrorism or anti-state activities -- can also restrict access.A retired senior prison department officer told Dawn that access to lawyers or relatives ultimately rests with the jail superintendent, who can block meetings or calls if an inmate’s behaviour is deemed ""not good"".Despite court orders and repeated attempts, Imran Khan’s three sisters, PTI members and CM Sohail Afridi have been camping outside Adiala Jail for days, demanding a meeting with him.Kasim Khan said the family has been kept completely in the dark: ""My father has been under arrest for 845 days. For the past six weeks, he has been kept in solitary confinement in a death cell with zero transparency. His sisters have been denied every visit, even with clear court orders allowing access. There have been no phone calls, no meetings and no proof of life. Me and my brother have had no contact with our father.""Calling the situation ""deliberate"", he added: ""This absolute blackout is not a security protocol. Rather it is a deliberate attempt to hide my father's condition and prevent our family from knowing whether he is safe… the Pakistani government and its handlers will be held fully accountable legally, morally and internationally for my father’s safety.""He also appealed to international organisations and human rights groups to intervene urgently.""We demand proof of his life, enforce court ordered access, end this inhumane isolation and call for the release of Pakistan’s most popular political leader who is being held solely for political reasons,"" Kasim said.","Former Pakistan PM Imran Khan has been in jail for over two years.

A medical board overseeing critically ill former Bangladesh prime minister Khaleda Zia has determined to send her to London for specialist treatment, according to her personal physician AZM Zahid Hossain.According to PTI, Zia, aged 80 and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) chairperson, is scheduled for transfer via air ambulance to London either late Thursday night or early Friday. Her elder son and acting BNP chief Tarique Rahman resides in London.Following a chest infection affecting her heart and lungs, Zia was hospitalised on November 23. She was moved to the coronary care unit (CCU) four days later due to deteriorating health complications.""The medical board has unanimously decided that she will be taken to London via the Qatar Royal Air Ambulance, either after midnight tonight or early tomorrow morning,"" Hossain announced outside the hospital.Whilst Hossain, a BNP standing committee member, refrained from detailed comments about Zia's current condition.At Tuesday's briefing, he had noted her positive response to treatment.

A helicopter transfer is expected from hospital to airport.A Chinese medical team of four specialists arrived Wednesday night, joining a UK medical group led by Dr Richard Buell. This marked the second Chinese delegation, following an advance team's arrival on December 1.Interim government leader Muhammad Yunus visited Wednesday, following visits from military service chiefs.

IMD Issues Red Alert as Cyclone Ditwah Approaches TN; Sri Lanka Deaths Exceed 80

Thousands trapped, isolated

Early warnings wasted

Rescue teams stretched 'beyond capacity'



Opposition blames government for loss of life



Too few alerts in Tamil language







Days after Cyclone Ditwah tore through Sri Lanka, over 1.46 million people across all 25 of the nation's districts remain affected by the island's worst flooding disaster in two decades.According to the government's Disaster Management Center, the official death toll stands at 410, with 336 people still missing. More than 64,000 people from 407,000 affected families are sheltering in nearly 1,450 government-run safety centers across the country.Multiple countries have responded to Sri Lanka's appeal for assistance with India leading the charge, followed by pledges from the UK, China, Australia, and Nepal. Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has also declared a state of emergency to deal with the aftermath of the cyclone.Despite his declaration and the promise of international aid, however, the Sri Lankan public seems increasingly frustrated with the state's response. Authorities appear to be overwhelmed with rescue demands and are struggling to communicate in a timely manner as critics point out the absence of a unified relief-and-rescue system.Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu, executive director of the Colombo-based Centre for Policy Alternatives, accuses the Sri Lankan government of failing to heed warning signals and allowing the calamity to spiral beyond human control.""The government has not come off well in its handling of the crisis and should have called Parliament to convene urgently to review and strengthen disaster management policies,"" Saravanamuttu told DW.According to Saravanamuttu, ""this disaster reveals significant gaps in preparedness and response mechanisms"" and the existing frameworks need to be evaluated to ""prevent future failures.""While Ditwah made landfall in Sri Lanka on November 28, some voices point out that warning signals were present as early as two weeks before. Experts say that the loss of life was exacerbated by the government's failure to act in a timely manner.""Unlike tsunamis, hydrometeorological hazards like cyclones arrive with sufficient notice of several days to take precautions. As early as November 12, Sri Lanka's department of meteorology had publicly flagged the prospect of extreme rainfall later in the month. That should have triggered a process of preparations across the government at central, provincial, and local levels,"" Nalaka Gunawardene, a science writer from Colombo, told DW.""Apparently, that did not happen, and an official response has mostly been reactive when Cyclone Ditwah was imminent or after it made landfall,"" added Gunawardene.""The entire disaster management structure – from policymakers to state officials – should be held accountable for cascading failures that made a bad disaster much worse.""Kishali Pinto-Jayawardena, a public interest advocate and legal columnist, agrees that the aftermath is ""particularly horrendous as the deadly impact of the cyclone was not realized until it was far too late.""She told DW that the governments should have ""the ability and the competence to take critical decisions"" in times of emergency.""Sentimental outpouring by politicians lauding the people for 'coming together' in times of crisis does not substitute for that duty,"" she added.Sivanathan Navindra, a former Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) member, who has been involved in political activities post-conflict, said the cyclone has damaged roads and communication lines in northern Sri Lanka.""The situation in northern Mannar, Mullaitivu, Vavuniya, and Kilinochchi districts is extremely severe. Mullaitivu has experienced a total power outage with telecommunication towers down, leaving residents without phone or internet access,"" Navindra told DW from Jaffna.""Road closures have effectively cut off the northern province, with travel between Vavuniya, Mullaitivu, Kilinochchi and Jaffna impossible,"" he said.Chathuranga Abeysinghe, deputy minister of Industry and Entrepreneurship Development, warned that rising water levels will make evacuation ""extremely difficult."" He urged residents along the Kelaniya River and flood-prone areas to leave.""There have been immense hardships caused by Cyclone Ditwah, but the president has constituted task forces to study the impact and organize relief. It will take a while for rebuilding,"" Abeysinghe told DW.""We had initial difficulty in predicting the cyclone's course"" Abeysinghe said, noting that significant rainfall expected was many different areas which ""stretched rescue teams beyond capacity to reach everyone in need.""Abeysinghe also pointed out that the government was working on a war-footing to reach vulnerable populations that had been cut off.Government critics, however, remain unconvinced by the official narrative. Opposition party Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) recently pledged to launch legal action against the government.SJB lawmaker and spokesperson S M Marikkar compared the severity of the disaster to the Easter Sunday suicide attacks which killed nearly 270 people in 2019, and the more recent economic collapse under the powerful Rajapaksa family.""Similar to the criminal case filed against the Rajapaksas for bankrupting the nation, we will file a case against the current government, as they are responsible for every citizen that died in the disaster,"" Marikkar told the media on Monday.Despite some relief materials being delivered and emergency teams arriving to certain affected locations, many communities still lack clarity on when full help will arrive and when normalcy can be restored. A notable communication obstacle, according to Colombo-based disinformation expert and analyst Sanjana Hattotuwa, is the choice of languages officials use for disaster communications.The nation recognizes both the majority language of Sinhala and the smaller Tamil language as official, with English — a remnant of the British colonial period — also spoken to varying degrees by nearly a quarter of its population.""My research showed key updates were in Sinhala only, and sometimes mirrored in English, but rarely, if ever in Tamil. State television and radio did not communicate the risks, and threats, mirroring what was evident on social media,"" Hattotuwa told DW.""This contributed to [an] information vacuum in critical hours, impacting preparedness and community responses,"" he said. ""If information was available in a more effective and timely manner, lives now lost may have been saved.""","Cyclone Ditwah has left over 1.46 million people in Sri Lanka affected by flooding.

Bangladesh Seeks Hasina’s Extradition After Death Verdict As India Weighs Options | Watch

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday permitted the entry of a pregnant woman and her eight-year-old child into India on “humanitarian grounds,” months after the pair had been pushed into Bangladesh.The top court was hearing the Centre’s challenge to the Calcutta High Court’s September 26 order, which struck down the government’s move to deport Sunali Khatun, Sweety Bibi and their families to Bangladesh after labelling them “illegal immigrants.”A bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi directed the West Bengal government to look after the minor and instructed the Birbhum district chief medical officer to ensure full medical support for Khatun, including a free delivery.The bench noted solicitor general Tushar Mehta’s statement that the competent authority had agreed to allow the woman and her child into India purely on humanitarian grounds, without affecting any rights or claims, and that they would be kept under “surveillance.”This followed the Supreme Court’s December 1 direction asking the Centre to consider permitting their entry, also on the condition that they remain under “surveillance.”The Supreme Court had earlier asked Mehta to seek instructions on permitting Khatun, who is in an advanced stage of pregnancy, to enter India through the India–Bangladesh border at Malda in West Bengal.The woman’s father said the family had lived as daily-wage workers in Delhi’s Rohini Sector 26 for more than two decades when police detained them on June 18 on suspicion of being Bangladeshi nationals.Sunali, her husband, Danish Sekh and their son were later taken into custody and, on June 27, were deported to Bangladesh.Also read: ‘Night at thana’: Was very scared, couldn’t sleep one bit, says Sunali During the hearing, the bench noted that the woman and her eight-year-old child, allowed to re-enter India, would ultimately be brought back to Delhi, from where they were picked up and pushed across the border in June, as cited by PTI.However, senior advocates Kapil Sibal and Sanjay Hegde, appearing for Khatun’s father, urged the court to direct that she be taken instead to her home district of Birbhum in West Bengal, where her family resides. They also informed the bench that others, including Khatun’s husband, remained in Bangladesh and sought directions for their return as well, subject to instructions from the Centre.Mehta maintained that he would challenge their claim of Indian citizenship, insisting the family were Bangladeshi nationals and that the government’s decision to admit the woman and her child was purely on humanitarian grounds.Justice Joymalya Bagchi observed that if Khatun could establish that she is the daughter of Bhodu Sheikh, it would be sufficient to prove her Indian citizenship.The court has listed the matter for further hearing on December 10.As per a May 2, 2025, memo issued by the union home ministry, Bangladesh and Myanmar nationals found residing illegally in any state or Union territory will first be subject to an inquiry by the respective state or UT government, after which the deportation process will be initiated.","The Supreme Court on Wednesday permitted the entry of a pregnant woman and her eight-year-old child into India on ""humanitarian grounds"" The top court was hearing the Centre's challenge to the Calcutta High Court's September 26 order, which struck down the government's move to deport them.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125738725,imgsize-1379982,width-400,resizemode-4/ani-file-photo.jpg"

Sheikh Hasina, UK MP Tulip Siddiq Convicted in Corruption Case, Raising Concerns Over Fair Trials





Bangladesh’s former prime minister Sheikh Hasina , her sister Sheikh Rehana and Hasina’s niece and British MP Tulip Siddiq were on Monday sentenced to different terms of imprisonment for ‘irregularities’ in allocation of plots under the Purbachal New Town project.Judge Rabiul Alam of Dhaka Special Judge Court-4 pronounced the verdict. Hasina, already sentenced to death for crimes against humanity, was handed five years’ imprisonment, while Rehana got seven years and Tulip Siddiq two years of jail.The court found Siddiq, the Labour MP for Hampstead and Highgate, guilty of misusing her “special influence” as a British politician to coerce Hasina into giving valuable pieces of land to her mother and siblings.Bangladesh does not have an extradition treaty with the United Kingdom (UK), and it is unlikely Siddiq will serve the sentence. The Labour party said it was not recognising the corruption judgment against Siddiq because she was denied the opportunity to a fair legal process in the case.Siddiq had denied the charges, claiming that much of the evidence being presented by prosecutors was forged. She had been put on trial as a Bangladeshi citizen, with a passport and tax ID, even though she said she had not held a Bangladeshi passport since childhood and had never paid taxes there.Siddiq said, “This whole process has been flawed and farcical from the beginning to the end.” “The outcome of this kangaroo court is as predictable as it is unjustified. I hope this so-called ‘verdict’ will be treated with the contempt it deserves. My focus has always been my constituents in Hampstead and Highgate, and I refuse to be distracted by politics of Bangladesh,” the Guardian quoted her as saying.","Sheikh Hasina, UK MP Tulip Siddiq Convicted in Corruption Case, Raising Concerns Over Fair Trials.

Sheikh Hasina, UK MP Tulip Siddiq Convicted in Corruption Case, Raising Concerns Over Fair Trials





All 17 convicts were fined Tk 1 lakh each, with an additional six months in jail if fines remain unpaid, the state-run BSS news agency reported. The court also imposed a fine of $813 each on Hasina, Rehana, and Siddiq, and ordered the cancellation of the plot allotted to Rehana.According to The Dhaka Tribune, the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) filed six separate cases between January 12 and 14 over alleged irregularities in the allocation of plots under the Purbachal project. The ACC alleged that Hasina, in collusion with senior Rajuk officials, unlawfully secured six plots, each measuring 10 kathas (7,200 sq ft), in the diplomatic zone of Sector 27 for herself, her children Joy and Putul, sister Rehana, niece Siddiq, and other relatives, despite being ineligible under existing regulations. Charges were framed against 29 people, including Hasina’s children Sajeeb Wazed Joy and Saima Wazed Putul, as part of multiple cases filed in January 2025.Tulip Siddiq, who represents Hampstead and Highgate in Britain’s Parliament, had previously denied the allegations, calling the trial “a farce built on ‘fabricated accusations and driven by a clear political vendetta’.” In January, she resigned as economic secretary to the Treasury in Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s Cabinet, saying she had been cleared of wrongdoing but stepped down because the issue was becoming “a distraction from the work of the government,” AP quoted.This verdict is one among several against Hasina. Earlier this month, a separate Dhaka court sentenced her to 21 years in jail across three corruption cases over the same Purbachal project, with consecutive seven-year terms and fines of Tk 1 lakh per case. Joy and Putul were also sentenced to five years each in related cases, Dhaka Tribune reported. Mass protests toppled Hasina’s Awami League regime on August 5, 2024, ending her rule after which she took refuge in India. She had earlier been declared a fugitive by a Bangladeshi court. She was also sentenced to death in absentia in November for her role in the violent crackdown on student-led protests, termed the “July Uprising”, and had previously been declared a fugitive.Bangladesh’s foreign affairs adviser Mohammad Touhid Hossain said the interim government expects India to consider Hasina’s extradition “at the earliest possible time,” now that judicial proceedings against her are complete.The country is currently run by an interim government headed by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, which has announced that the next parliamentary elections will be held in February.","All 17 convicts were fined Tk 1 lakh each, with an additional six months in jail if fines remain unpaid.

Nepal has awarded a contract to a Chinese state-owned security printing firm to produce new banknotes across multiple denominations, a central bank official confirmed on Sunday.Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) has selected China Bank Note Printing and Minting Corporation to design, print and supply notes of NRs 50, NRs 500 and NRs 1,000, spokesperson Guru Prasad Paudel told PTI. Under the newly awarded contract, the company must deliver the notes within nine months.Paudel said the NRB provides the technical specifications, after which the Chinese firm prepares a design that must be approved by the central bank before printing begins.Earlier this month, the same Chinese company also received a Letter of Intent to design and print 430 million pieces of the NRs 1,000 denomination.The upcoming NRs 1,000 note will feature seven rhododendrons, Nepal’s national flower, representing the country’s seven provinces. It will also carry the signature of the current governor, Prof Dr Biswo Nath Poudel, appearing for the first time in this banknote series.China Bank Note Printing and Minting Corporation was selected on the basis of the lowest evaluated bid and has previously printed Nepalese notes of Rs 5, Rs 10, Rs 100 and Rs 500.Meanwhile, on Thursday, Nepal’s central bank issued new Rs 100 notes carrying a revised national map that includes the Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura regions -- territories that India maintains belong to it. Nepal claims these areas, lying east of the Mahakali river, fall within its borders according to the 1816 Sugauli Treaty.These disputed territories were incorporated into Nepal’s political map in May 2020 by the K P Sharma Oli government, a move later endorsed by Parliament. India had sharply criticised the updated map at the time, calling it a unilateral and unacceptable “artificial enlargement” of territorial claims.NRB officials noted that Nepal’s Rs 1 and Rs 2 coins have already been minted with the revised map for the past two years.","Nepal has awarded a contract to a Chinese state-owned security printing firm to produce new banknotes across multiple denominations.

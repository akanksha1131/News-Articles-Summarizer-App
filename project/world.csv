Oman announces new fees for citizenship and nationality applications,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/oman-announces-new-fees-for-citizenship-and-nationality-applications/articleshow/126365443.cms,"Oman now charges OMR 600 for citizenship applications and OMR 200 for nationality withdrawal/Image: X





Applying for Omani citizenship will now come with a clearly defined price tag. In a move aimed at tightening and standardising nationality services, Oman has approved a new fee structure covering both citizenship applications and requests to relinquish nationality, according to details published in the Sultanate’s Official Gazette.Under the revised framework, the fee for submitting an application to obtain Omani citizenship has been set at OMR 600. This charge applies to foreign women married to Omani nationals, as well as widows or divorced spouses of Omanis. The same fee also covers applications submitted on behalf of the minor children of Omani women, ensuring a uniform cost across these family-based eligibility categories.In addition to citizenship applications, the updated regulations introduce an OMR 200 fee for requests related to the withdrawal or relinquishment of Omani nationality. This marks the formal introduction of charges for nationality renunciation, placing it alongside citizenship acquisition within a standardised administrative fee structure.The new fee schedule came into force on January 4, 2026, and applies across the Sultanate. Authorities have made clear that the decision is limited strictly to application and service fees. There are no changes to eligibility criteria, legal requirements, or the laws governing citizenship and nationality matters, and applicants must continue to meet the same conditions as before.Officials say the revised fees form part of broader efforts to streamline and standardise administrative procedures related to nationality services. By clearly outlining costs in the Official Gazette, the government aims to provide applicants with greater transparency, consistency, and certainty when navigating citizenship and nationality processes in Oman.","Oman now charges OMR 600 for citizenship applications and OMR 200 for nationality withdrawal.

Ceasefire violation: Cambodia’s 'operational error' breaks 10-day truce; 1 Thai soldier wounded in border clash,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/ceasefire-violation-cambodias-operational-error-breaks-10-day-truce-1-thai-soldier-wounded-in-border-clash/articleshow/126364912.cms,"AP image

'Not Aware Of Acts': Thailand Slams Trump Claim Cambodia Conflict As Bangkok Vows Retaliation





Thailand on Tuesday said its Cambodian counterpart claimed that fresh cross-border fire was 'an operational error', following Bangkok’s allegation that Cambodian forces violated a 10-day-old truce.“A military unit in the area was contacted by the Cambodian side who claimed there was no intention to fire into Thai territory and said the incident was caused by an operational error by Cambodian personnel,” the Thai army said in a statement.The statement comes after Thailand earlier accused Cambodia of violating the same ceasefire, alleging that Cambodian forces fired mortars into a Thai border province, wounding one soldier.Thailand’s army said the incident took place on morning in Ubon Ratchathani province, along the disputed border. In a statement, the army said, “Cambodia has violated the ceasefire,” accusing Cambodian forces of firing mortar rounds into Thai territory. It added that one Thai soldier was wounded by shrapnel and was being evacuated for medical treatment.The allegation comes despite a truce agreed on December 27, which was meant to end nearly three weeks of fighting between the two Southeast Asian neighbours.The ceasefire was signed after weeks of intense clashes that included fighter-jet sorties, rocket fire and artillery barrages, marking the worst fighting between the two countries in years.At the time of the agreement, the defence ministers of both countries said they would freeze troop movements along the border. In a joint statement, they said, “Both sides agree to maintain current troop deployments without further movement.”The statement warned that “any reinforcement would heighten tensions and negatively affect long-term efforts to resolve the situation,” according to CNN.The truce was signed by Thai defence minister Natthaphon Narkphanit and his Cambodian counterpart Tea Seiha, ending around 20 days of fighting that killed at least 101 people and displaced more than half a million civilians on both sides.The long-running conflict between Thailand and Cambodia dates back more than a century, with both countries contesting sovereignty at several undemarcated points along their 817-kilometre land border. While the dispute has simmered for decades, it has periodically erupted into violence.Tensions escalated again last year, with clashes in December killing dozens and forcing around one million people to flee their homes across border regions.The latest round of fighting was re-ignited in early December after the collapse of a previous ceasefire that had been brokered with the involvement of US President Donald Trump and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim.The agreement had also included humanitarian steps, such as the return of displaced civilians and a pledge that neither side would use force against civilians. Thailand had also agreed to return 18 Cambodian soldiers captured during earlier clashes if the ceasefire held for 72 hours.","Cambodia claims fresh cross-border fire was 'an operational error' Thai army claims Cambodian forces fired mortars into a Thai border province, wounding one soldier.

Trump SNUBS NATO Nations Over Greenland ‘INVASION, FEARS’ Putin & Xi | ‘US NEEDS Arctic Island’





Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen on Monday strongly rejected US President Donald Trump ’s renewed claims about Greenland, the autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark.Frederiksen dismissed Trump's repetitive assertions that the US ""needs"" Greenland for ""security reasons"", calling it an ""unacceptable pleasure."" Speaking to a Danish broadcaster, she said, ""Unfortunately, I think the American president should be taken seriously when he says he wants Greenland,"" also mentioning that both Denmark and Greenland have repeatedly ruled out any possibility of the island becoming part of the United States.When asked what it would mean if the US used force against another Nato member, Frederiksen replied, ""If the US attacks another Nato country, everything stops."" She added that while she cannot predict Washington's actions, ""there is full support from Europe that borders must be respected.""In a Sunday interview with The Atlantic, Trump insisted the US ""absolutely"" needs Greenland and discussed American intervention in Venezuela.Reviving his long-running interest in acquiring the island, he argued that it is crucial for US national security. ""We need Greenland. ... It’s so strategic right now. Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place,"" he claimed. ""We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security, and Denmark is not going to be able to do it.""In response, Frederiksen issued a statement on Sunday saying the US has no right to annex Greenland and urging Washington to stop issuing threats toward a close ally and the people of Greenland.Tensions escalated further after Trump appointed Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry as the US special envoy to Greenland last month. Since taking office in January 2025, Trump has repeatedly shown interest in gaining control of the island, saying he would not rule out using “military or economic coercion” to pursue that goal.","Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen strongly rejected US President Donald Trump’s renewed claims about Greenland.

US hotel that denied rooms to ICE agents was bought by four Indian-Americans for $15 million: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-hotel-that-denied-rooms-to-ice-agents-was-bought-by-four-indian-americans-for-15-million-report/articleshow/126364578.cms,"In Lakeville, Minnesota, a Hampton Inn has sparked controversy after its new Indian ownership turned away reservations from ICE and DHS agents, allegedly guided by a principle of non-cooperation with immigration enforcement. While Hilton clarified that such actions do not align with the company's ethos, both the hotel management and Hilton expressed regret and reaffirmed their dedication to inclusivity.





The Hampton Inn by Hilton in Lakeville, Minnesota, which recently refused reservations to ICE and DHS agents, was purchased last year by four Indian partners, according to public records.The hotel was bought for $15 million through an LLC owned by Parmjit Singh, Amanpreet Hundal, Karandeep Nagra, and Mohinderjeet Kaur, according to filings with the Minnesota secretary of state.The incident stirred a row after emails shared on social media by DHS and ICE alleged that staff at the hotel told federal officers their reservations would not be accepted.One email stated said: “We have noticed an influx of GOV reservations made today that have been for DHS, and we are not allowing any ICE or immigration agents to stay at our property.”Another added: “Please pass on this info to your coworkers that we are not allowing any immigration agents to house on our property.”A Hilton spokesperson told FOX Business that the hotel is independently owned and that the actions described do not reflect Hilton’s values.“Hilton hotels serve as welcoming places for all. This hotel is independently owned and operated, and the actions referenced are not reflective of Hilton values,” the spokesperson said.The spokesperson added that the staff have already apologised for their behaviour: “We have been in direct contact with the hotel, and they have apologised for the actions of their team, which was not in keeping with their policies. They have taken immediate action to resolve this matter. Hilton’s position is clear: Our properties are open to everyone and we do not tolerate any form of discrimination.”The management company operating the hotel, Everpeak Hospitality, also released a statement affirming its commitment to welcoming all guests and following brand standards and applicable laws: “We are in touch with the impacted guests to ensure they are accommodated. We do not discriminate against any individuals or agencies and apologise to those impacted.”The dispute shows a long-standing policy of Hilton Hotels. In 2020, the company publicly opposed using its properties in connection with immigration detention and reinforced the stance across its US hotels.DHS assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin criticised Hilton’s actions, saying, “Hilton has launched a coordinated campaign in Minneapolis to REFUSE service to DHS law enforcement. When officers attempted to book rooms using official government emails and rates, Hilton Hotels maliciously CANCELLED their reservations. This is UNACCEPTABLE.”The matter remains under investigation by Hilton, which has said it is working with the hotel to ensure compliance with its policies.","Hampton Inn in Lakeville, Minnesota, recently refused reservations to ICE and DHS agents.

'Nobody is going to fight...': Top White House aide does not rule out military option if US targets Greenland,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/nobody-is-going-to-fight-top-white-house-aide-does-not-rule-out-military-option-if-us-targets-greenland/articleshow/126364133.cms,"In a bold statement, a White House aide suggested that military action in Greenland could be on the table, referring to it as a former Danish 'colony.' President Trump is eyeing the Arctic territory for its strategic significance amid growing foreign naval presence.





A top White House aide on Monday did not rule out the use of military force if the United States ever decided to take control of Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark.Stephen Miller, senior adviser to President Donald Trump, described Greenland as ""a colony of Denmark"" and claimed, ""Nobody is gonna fight the US militarily over the future of Greenland. ""The comments follow calls by Trump for the Arctic island to come under US control. Trump told journalists on Sunday, ""We need Greenland,"" arguing that controlling the island was essential for Washington's ""national security.""The MAGA chief added that the island is surrounded by ""Chinese and Russian ships"" and has previously offered to purchase Greenland. Trump has also not ruled out military action to achieve that aim.The push sparked warnings from Denmark’s Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen. She said that a US takeover of Greenland would threaten the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), stating, ""If the United States decides to military attack another NATO country, then everything would stop — that includes NATO and therefore post-World War II security.""Frederiksen warned that such a move could disrupt decades of international cooperation and security agreements.However, Miller said that: ""Greenland should be part of the US. By what right does Denmark assert control over Greenland? The US is the power of NATO.""Greenland’s own premier, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, urged both Denmark and the US to work through proper channels. He told the public, ""The situation is not such that the United States can conquer Greenland. That is not the case. Therefore, we must not panic. We must restore the good cooperation we once had.""He also posted on social media, asking Trump to abandon ""fantasies of annexing Greenland"" and that any discussions must respect international law.Greenland has major strategic and economic value. The island hosts a US military base and is rich in oil, minerals and other resources.Moreover, melting Arctic ice could make Greenland a key location for future shipping routes. Copenhagen has previously expressed willingness to allow more US troops on the island.Trump’s comments on Greenland come shortly after the US operation to capture Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, which has raised questions about the administration’s approach to international law.","Stephen Miller, senior adviser to President Donald Trump, described Greenland as ""a colony of Denmark"" Miller claimed, ""Nobody is gonna fight the US militarily over the future of Greenland"" The comments follow calls by Trump for the Arctic island to come under US control.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126364133,imgsize-24242,width-400,resizemode-4/126364133.jpg"

Indian-American MAGA supporter and Trump loyalist Mehek Cooke said she was “attacked” while conducting a fraud investigation in Ohio in an incident captured on video.In a post on X, Cooke shared a nearly 8-minute clip of the confrontation and wrote: “Day 1 into our Columbus, Ohio fraud investigation. Nothing to see here except me being attacked. ”Cooke is an Indian-born lawyer, Republican consultant and conservative commentator who has been vocal about alleged Medicaid fraud in Ohio.The video shows Cooke and a companion approaching a home health care office to ask questions about services. Staff initially refused to respond, and the encounter escalated when a group of men confronted the investigators.“What are you guys doing here?” one man asked.Cooke replied, “I’m asking about Home Health Care Services.”The men then accused her of spreading false information about the Somali community. One said, “You are from India. You aren’t a white person,” and added, “Because your last name is Cooke doesn’t mean that you’re white. You’re from India and you just spread a lot of BS.”Cooke repeatedly denied the accusations, saying, “We aren’t coming here to harass anyone,” and ensured that she was asking questions about fraud and not targeting any community.“We actually talked to the agency and then also talked about home health care,” she said, while pointing out that there are 34 home health care businesses in the building and that her team had visited each one.The video shows the confrontation continuing with overlapping arguments. Cooke tried calm down the situation and said: “We are peacefully here,” and encouraged the men to watch her previous videos, which she said showed respectful interactions with members of the Somali community.Eventually, Cooke and her companion left the scene without things getting worse.Later, Cooke said, replying to her own post: ""What kind of business responds to questions about their services with intimidation?""","Mehek Cooke is an Indian-born lawyer, Republican consultant and conservative commentator.

'NO OIL, GOLD FOR US': Maduro’s Deputy Delcy Rodríguez TRASHES Trump’s Solution To Run Venezuela

Who is

Delcy Rodriguez

Delcy Rodriguez is Venezuela’s executive vice president and was directed by the Supreme Court to serve as interim president after Nicolas Maduro was captured during the US military operation.

She is a trained lawyer from Caracas and studied law at the Central University of Venezuela.

Rodriguez has been a senior figure in the chavismo political movement for more than two decades and is regarded as one of Maduro’s closest and most trusted political allies.

She has held several powerful roles in government, including serving as Venezuela’s foreign minister.

Before assuming the interim role, she was also in charge of key economic portfolios, overseeing finance and the country’s oil sector.

She is the sister of Jorge Rodriguez, the president of Venezuela’s National Assembly, and together they have been central figures in the government since the era of former president Hugo Chavez.





Venezuela’s entered a new and uncertain phase on Saturday after President Nicolas Maduro was captured during a US military operation. With no immediate political transition announced, the country’s Supreme Court stepped in, ordering Vice President Delcy Rodriguez to assume the role of interim president, in line with constitutional provisions dealing with a president’s absence.Rodriguez took charge hours after Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were detained. She chaired a meeting of the National Defence Council the same day, appearing alongside senior ministers and military officials.In the meeting, she demanded the immediate release of Maduro and Flores and strongly condemned the US operation. In a televised address, Rodriguez said the early-morning strike violated international law and Venezuela’s sovereignty. She alsocalled on Venezuelans to remain united and urged governments across Latin America to reject what she described as the use of force against a sovereign nation.Rodriguez also insisted that Maduro remains Venezuela’s legitimate president, despite his capture. “There is only one president in this country, and his name is Nicolas Maduro,” she said during the council meeting broadcast on state television.Trump told reporters following Mudaro's capture that Rodriguez was willing to cooperate with Washington. He said she had spoken at length with Rubio and had shown readiness to do “whatever” the US needed.""I think she was quite gracious,"" Trump added. ""We can't take a chance that somebody else takes over Venezuela that doesn't have the good of the Venezuelan people in mind.""",Rodriguez is Venezuela’s executive vice president and was directed by the Supreme Court to serve as interim president.

At least seven loud explosions were heard across Venezuela’s capital, Caracas (early Saturday), with air sirens and low-flying aircraft adding to the alarm. Several neighborhoods reported panic on the streets and power outages following the blasts.According to AFP, the blasts were heard around 2.00 am local time (0600 GMT). The first explosion was recorded shortly before 1.50 am.“One was so strong, my window was shaking after it,” CNN correspondent Osmary Hernández said.Witnesses reported hearing aircraft overhead following the explosions. Smoke was also visible in the southern part of the city near a major military base, according to Reuters. Videos of the explosions quickly surfaced on social media.President Donald Trump confirmed that US had ordered strikes on sites inside Venezuela, including military facilities. Trump also said that Venezuela's president Nicolás Maduro has been captures along with his wife and flown out of the country.The strikes follow months of American military buildup in the region, including the deployment of the USS Gerald R Ford aircraft carrier and several other warships in the Caribbean.The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has banned American commercial flights from operating in Venezuelan airspace, citing concerns over “ongoing military activity,” shortly before a series of explosions were reported in the capital, news agency AP reported.Several areas of Caracas were left without electricity and residents in multiple neighborhoods rushed out onto the streets.Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro, earlier declared a national emergency after a series of explosions rocked the capital Caracas. The government accused the United States of carrying out “military aggression” against civilian and military installations across multiple states. The government further for 'mobilization' of the population after US 'attack', news agency AFP reported.In a government statement, Venezuelan authorities said the US had attacked strategic sites in several parts of the country.The incident comes amid heightened regional tensions, as US President Donald Trump has recently deployed a naval task force to the Caribbean and raised the possibility of ground strikes against Venezuela. In recent days, the US military has also been targeting alleged drug-smuggling boats in the region.The US Embassy in Bogotá has issued travel advisory urging US citizens not to travel to Venezuela. In its warning issued, the embassy said Americans currently in Venezuela should shelter in place and leave the country as soon as it is safe to do so.The embassy reminded citizens that Venezuela is under a Level 4 “Do Not Travel” advisory, the highest warning level, citing severe risks including wrongful detention, torture in detention, terrorism, kidnapping, crime, civil unrest and poor health infrastructure.The US Department of State withdrew all diplomatic personnel from its embassy in Caracas in March 2019 and suspended operations. As a result, all consular services, including emergency assistance, remain unavailable and the US government has no ability to provide help to American citizens inside Venezuela.The advisory also urged US citizens to establish multiple ways of communicating with family and friends outside Venezuela and to closely monitor developments as the situation unfolds.Colombian President Gustavo Petro on Saturday posted an official statement from the Venezuelan government, in which Caracas accused the United States of carrying out a serious military attack on Venezuelan territory.“The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela rejects, repudiates, and denounces before the international community the extremely serious military aggression perpetrated by the current Government of the United States of America against Venezuelan territory and population,” the statement read.The statement claimed the alleged attack violated the United Nations Charter, citing Articles 1 and 2 on respect for sovereignty and the prohibition of the use of force, and warned that such actions “threaten international peace and stability, specifically in Latin America and the Caribbean, and put the lives of millions of people at grave risk.”According to the statement shared by Petro, the Venezuelan government said the objective of the alleged attack was “to seize Venezuela’s strategic resources, particularly its oil and minerals” and to undermine the country’s political independence. “They will not succeed,” the statement added.Earlier, Maduro had claimed that he was open to negotiating with the United States on issues including drug trafficking, oil and migration. Speaking in a pre-recorded interview aired on Venezuelan state television on Thursday, Maduro said he was ready for dialogue with Washington “wherever they want and whenever they want.”However, Maduro also accused the US of using its months-long pressure campaign as a way to force a change in government and gain access to Venezuela’s vast oil reserves.He strongly rejected allegations that his administration is linked to drug cartels, calling the US “war on drugs” a pretext for intervention. Asked directly about President Trump’s claim that American forces had struck a docking facility in Venezuela, Maduro declined to confirm or deny the report, saying it was “something we could talk about in a few days.”On Monday, Trump said the United States had carried out a strike on a “dock area” in Venezuela used by boats allegedly involved in drug trafficking, describing it as a “major explosion.” According to CNN, the blast was caused by a drone strike carried out by the CIA.""There was a major explosion in the dock area where they load the boats up with drugs. We hit all the boats, and now we hit the area... it's the implementation area,"" Trump said.The remarks came as the US military has intensified operations against suspected drug-smuggling vessels in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific.Since September, American forces have carried out more than 30 strikes on boats they say were involved in narcotics trafficking, resulting in over 110 deaths, according to US officials. The latest attack, reported earlier this week, killed five people aboard two boats, the US military said.Trump has repeatedly accused Maduro of flooding the US with drugs and migrants, claims the Venezuelan leader strongly denies. He has also doubled the reward for information leading to Maduro’s capture and threatened to designate his government as a Foreign Terrorist Organisation.","At least seven loud explosions heard across Venezuela’s capital, Caracas (early Saturday), with air sirens and low-flying aircraft adding to the alarm. Several neighborhoods reported panic on the streets and power outages following the blasts. Venezuelan authorities said the US had attacked strategic sites in several parts of the country. US Embassy in Bogotá has issued travel advisory urging US citizens not to travel to Venezuela.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126318568,imgsize-1543738,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

He had spent the night in a federal jail in Brooklyn before being transported to a Manhattan courthouse to face criminal charges.Attorney General Pam Bondi said Maduro was brought to the US to ""face justice"".The Trump administration described the operation as ""basically a law enforcement function"", rather than a military campaign.""All personnel involved acted professionally, decisively, and in strict accordance with US law and established protocols,"" Bondi said.Maduro pleaded not guilty in court on Monday.

Maduro was flown to New York, where he was arraigned at a Manhattan courthouse and pleaded not guilty.After the mission, President Trump said that the US will 'run' Venezuela.

U.S. Rewrites H-1B Rules, Setback To Indian Workers; Check Who Is Eligible & Changes | WATCH

'Would not want them to travel abroad,' says immigration lawyer





A prolonged wait for US visa appointments has forced many Indian immigrants to make painful personal choices, including missing major family events.An H-4 visa holder living in Seattle recalled how visa delays stopped her from travelling to India for her brother’s wedding last month. Instead, she watched the ceremony online from her home in US and congratulated the couple on call.“Last month, I missed my only brother’s wedding ceremony that was held in India. We congratulated the couple over the phone,” she told The American Bazaar.She added: “I watched a live stream of the wedding with tears rolling down my eyes as I carried out my mundane chores, like packing kids’ school lunches, on a cold Seattle morning, while my brother said his vows. It hurt bad, but going to India currently, with no definite clarity on the visa appointment, would have meant inviting more uncertainties in our lives.”Her experience is relatable to thousands of Indian professionals and their families who moved to US on work visas to build stable careers and lives. Instead, many are now facing delays, backlogs and unclear timelines, leaving them torn between family responsibilities and the risk of being unable to return to US.Immigration attorney Gnanamookan Senthurjothi suggested immigrants on H-4, H1-B visas take a practical approach and think more about their careers.“This situation presents a profound conflict between deep emotions surrounding the loss of their father and practical solutions to protect his US status and career. Still, as an immigration lawyer, I would not want them to travel abroad, as the chances of returning to the US immediately look very bleak,” Senthurjothi said.Senthurjothi said travelling abroad could have serious financial and professional consequences. “If he/she travels abroad, we are hearing about people stuck in India for various reasons for several weeks or months, and during that time they end up losing their job,” he said.He warned that changing employers later could be costly and that “any new petition that will be filed by a different employer will attract a $100K fee”.Some visa holders currently stranded in India are trying to continue working remotely with employer approval. On this, Senthurjothi said, “H-1B holders permitted short-term remote work until a visa is issued from India should remain on US payrolls as long as feasible.”","US visa appointment backlogs mean missing family milestones such as weddings.

Or showing any respect for actual working Americans.""Putsch's response came after the X handle of the Ohio Republican Party praised Ramaswamy as a candidate in their state.Ex-DOGE leader Ramaswamy wrote in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece that he removed X and Instagram from his phone on New Year’s Eve to focus on listening to voters directly. ""I’ll spend my newfound time listening to more voters in real-world Ohio, developing more policies to make our state affordable, and being more present with my family,"" he said.He added that his campaign team would continue to use social media to distribute messages, but he personally would not scroll through posts.

$400,000 in a matter of hours

Was it an inside job?





A single anonymous trader made a fortune betting that Nicolás Maduro would be removed from power in Venezuela, earning over $400,000 in a matter of hours.The big profit on Polymarket, a crypto-based betting site, has raised questions about whether someone knew in advance about the secret US operation that captured the Latin American leader straight from his habitat.The trader created an account last month and began placing bets on December 27, investing $96 in contracts that would pay out if US invaded Venezuela by January 31, according to the Wall Street Journal.Next week, the person slowly but steadily increased their wagers and focused on contracts predicting Maduro’s removal by the same date.Polymarket data shows the final bet was placed at 9:58 pm ET on Friday, just hours before President Donald Trump started the mission.At the time, the contracts were priced at only 8 cents each, implying just an 8 per cent chance of success.When news of the US action came out, the contracts surged by a huge margin and left the trader with nearly $410,000 in profit from around $34,000 in wagers. More than half of the total bets were made the night before the operation. The account uses a default blockchain address as its screen name.“It’s more likely than not that this was an insider. That’s a lot of money to put in at that price, without a lot of news,” said Tre Upshaw, founder of Polysights, which provides analytics tools for Polymarket users.The Trump administration reportedly kept the operation secret within a small circle of advisers. It involved coordination across multiple military branches, with 150 warplanes deployed from 20 locations.Democratic leader Ritchie Torres said he plans to introduce a law to stop government officials from betting on prediction markets when they have private information. Polymarket officially blocks Americans, but many users get around the rules using virtual private networks.Polymarket founder Shayne Coplan said self-regulation is pretty relevant now on the platform and users are actively flagging suspicious bets in real time.Coplan said the plan was not carried out in secrecy as it's not possible: “The moment there is a suspected insider, it’s pointed out on X, and it’s visible on Polymarket immediately. So it’s not like it’s done in darkness.""","Trader placed $96 in contracts that would pay out if US invaded Venezuela by January 31.

Ousted Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, appeared in a New York courtroom for the first time on Monday, where Flores was seen with visible injuries and bandages as her lawyer said she suffered “significant injuries” during what the couple claims was an abduction by US authorities.Both Maduro, 63, and Flores, 69, pleaded not guilty to charges including cocaine importation and weapons offenses, according to reporting from CNN. The pair did not contest their detention at this stage of the proceedings.When asked to confirm his identity, Maduro stood and began speaking in Spanish as a court-appointed translator relayed his words into English.“I was captured at my home in Caracas, Venezuela,” Maduro said, before adding, “I am still president of my country.”When Judge Alvin Hellerstein asked how he pleaded, Maduro responded, “I am innocent. I am not guilty of anything that is mentioned here. I am a decent man.”Flores also pleaded not guilty, telling the judge through a Spanish translator, “Not guilty, completely innocent.”When asked to confirm her identity, she said, “I am first lady of the Republic of Venezuela.”According to CNN, Flores entered the courtroom flanked by US Marshals with bandages on her forehead and right temple.She required assistance to sit down at the defense table before the hearing began.Her attorney, Mark Donnelly, told Judge Hellerstein that Flores would need a physical evaluation and possible treatment for “significant injuries” sustained during the “abduction.”“She may have a fracture or at least severe bruising on her ribs,” Donnelly said.Maduro’s attorney, Barry Pollack, added that the former Venezuelan leader also has “some health and medical issues that will require attention,” though he did not elaborate.CNN legal analyst Laura Coates, who was present in court, said both defendants appeared physically strained during the hearing.She described Maduro and Flores as “having difficulty sitting and getting up from their chairs.”Coates noted that Maduro frequently looked over at his wife during the proceedings. Flores, she said, appeared more “demure” and “withdrawn” than her husband.Maduro and Flores were taken into U.S. custody by the American military on Jan. 3, according to US officials. The couple maintains they were unlawfully seized. Their next court appearance is scheduled for March 17, according to the court.Back in Venezuela, Delcy Rodriguez has been sworn-in as the interim President. Rodriguez was sworn in at the National Assembly, where she told lawmakers she was taking the oath “in the name of all Venezuelans.” She also signaled a willingness to cooperate with Washington.

MAGA commentator Tucker Carlson claimed that one possible reason President Donald Trump ordered the capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro was to legalise gay marriage in the country.Speaking on his show, the right-wing podcaster said that Maduro did not allow homosexual marriages in Venezuela and that might have led the US to attack it, “It's possible we're mad that he [Maduro] doesn’t allow gay marriage. That is a distinct possibility. But no one will say that out loud.”Carlson described Venezuela as one of the most conservative countries in the Americas, and the fact that it has also banned pornography, abortion, gay marriage, sex changes, and usury. He added that the US-backed opposition leader who would replace Maduro is “pretty eager to get gay marriage in Venezuela.”“So those of you who thought this whole project was globo homo—not crazy, actually,” Carlson said, referring to suggestions that pro-gay forces were behind Maduro’s removal. Carlson also cited opposition leader María Corina Machado, who is pro-gay marriage, as one of the reasons.Right-wing influencer Ben Shapiro responded to Carlson’s comments and said that his claims are not true and US took action to safeguard its national security. “Well, I suppose the administration may have to explain to people like Tucker Carlson that in fact it was not ‘globo homo’ that ousted Nicolás Maduro, it was a conservative Republican president.A gutsy president who makes the calls to preserve America’s national security and her foreign interests. ”Indian-origin MAGA ally Dinesh D'Souza also weighed in on Carlson's comments. In a post on X, he said: ""The oldest living Groyper says it’s a “distinct possibility” that Trump captured Maduro because of Maduro’s opposition to gay marriage. Wow!

Honorable mention: Nick Fuentes





Indian-origin GOP leader Vivek Ramaswamy , running for Ohio Governor as the GOp candidate, announced Monday that his 2026 resolution is to become a social media toototaler. In an opinion piece for the Wall Street Journal, Ramaswamy said he deleted X and Instagram from his phone on December 31 and decided not to browse any of the apps himself for the time being, while his campaign team will still use social media on his behalf.Ramaswamy said sensing social media pulse can go wrong as social media pulse is increasingly manufactured by foreign actors and nonhuman bots. Addressing the non-stop hate he gets online because of his Indian-origin and because of his Hindu religion, Ramaswamy said he did not get that hate when he visited tens of thousands of voters in Ohio's 88 counties. ""I didn’t hear a single bigoted remark from an Ohio voter the entire year,"" he said.The last time Vivek Ramaswamy wrote an op-ed, he was canceled by MAGA as he explained in that NYT piece what it means to be an American. MAGA rejected the preaching from an Indian-origin leader and rallied support to his rival candidate.In his Journal op-ed about social media, Ramaswamy clarified that he is not preaching that everyone should stay off social media. ""None of this is to say citizens shouldn’t use social media to sway politicians.It’s their constitutional right to do so. But it’s up to elected leaders to know what they’re responding to,"" he wrote.""Real leaders must break free. It’s fashionable these days for leaders to complain about the influence of social media on politics, but do nothing to fix it. Yet the first step doesn’t even require new laws. We just need to practice what we preach.""In the WSJ op-ed too, Ramaswamy made a passing mention of Nick Fuentes, who announced to campaign against Ramaswamy in Ohio so that Christmas is celebrated at the Guv mansion in Ohio next year, instead of Diwali.""A recent report revealed that engagement with the X account of the now-notorious white nationalist Nick Fuentes shows signs of being “unusually fast, unusually concentrated and unusually foreign in origin.” Another investigation showed that hundreds of bots drove the pro-Democrat #BlueCrew hashtag, amplifying false claims that the assassination attempt on President Trump in Butler, Pa., was staged.

Donald Trump is not shy of making elaborate claims and the new year seems to have pumped him up with some much-needed energy it seems. After capturing Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores and claiming to take over the rule of Venezuela, he is off to making some more of his eyebrow-raising claims.The President, 79, is back to falsely insisting that he predicted 9/11 and thousands of lives would have been saved, only if people had listened to him. Over the last decade, Trump has made such claims numerous times and it seems he is bent on making it into an annual reminder.On Sunday night, Trump again painted himself as a visionary to reporters aboard Air Force One as he flew back to Washington, D.C. As Senator Lindsey Graham gushed over the US military's capture of Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro, Trump suddenly went off to dish out his counterterrorism credentials.And the first thing he could name was reclaiming his prediction of Bin Laden and 9/11. “By the way, you mention something that is interesting,” the president said. “Lindsey mentioned Bin Laden. You know, I wrote about Bin Laden one year before the attack on the World Trade Center. And I said, you have to go after bin Laden. It was in my book.""“Very few people want to say that. But it was in my book... [If] they would have listened to me, they would have taken out bin Laden, and you wouldn‘t have had the World Trade Center tragedy.”Looking at Graham, he added, “Did you know that? I predicted bin Laden.” To which Graham replied, ""I learn something new every day.""According to him, he warned about the dangers of former Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in his 2000 book, 'The America We Deserve' despite fact checks proving he didn't.He wrote the book along with ghostwriter Dave Shiflett, during his presidential run for Ross Perot's Reform Party USA. Since then, he has made the same claim numerous times. He said it on The Alex Jones Show in December 2015, then in October 2019 after the death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and again in October 2025 while speaking with sailors to mark the US Navy's 250th birthday.However, FactCheck.org wrote in 2015 that “Donald Trump exaggerates his prescience on the 9/11 terrorist attacks when he claims he ‘predicted Osama bin Laden.’” It added that Bin Laden is mentioned in the book only once, where Trump described him as a minor figure in a mosaic of ""smaller crises.""","The President, 79, is back to falsely insisting that he predicted 9/11 and thousands of lives would have been saved, only if people had listened to him.

ISLAMABAD: The polio vaccination campaign in Pakistan's merged districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa fell short of its target, leaving over 935,000 children under five unvaccinated, officials said, citing security challenges and population displacement as key hurdles, The Express Tribune reported.According to The Express Tribune, citing authorities, thousands of families from North and South Waziristan, Bajaur, and other merged districts have migrated to different parts of the country, complicating monitoring and vaccination efforts.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Khyber Pakhtunkhwa reported 19 polio cases in 2025, including four each in North Waziristan, Lakki Marwat, and Tank; three in Bannu; two in Torghar; and one each in Dera Ismail Khan and Lower Kohistan, as reported by The Express Tribune.Officials noted that staffing and operational support for WHO and Unicef programmes in the merged districts were reduced last year, while WHO funding cuts also affected campaign coverage, leaving children in these areas at heightened risk.In Sindh, more than 12,000 children under five were reportedly missed during the final polio drive of 2025 in Hyderabad and surrounding areas, according to The Express Tribune.Refusals were recorded mainly in Cantonment areas and municipal towns such as Hussainabad, Preetabad, Qasimabad, and Tando Jam, with absent households and parental refusals cited as primary reasons.Despite these gaps, the nationwide anti-polio campaign successfully vaccinated more than 44.6 million children across Pakistan, according to The Express Tribune.Punjab led with 22.9 million children vaccinated, followed by Sindh with 10.6 million, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with 7.15 million, and Balochistan with 2.58 million.Officials said contributions from other regions also added to the national tally.Authorities warned that without sustained vaccination efforts, particularly in displaced and high-risk populations, children in the merged districts remain vulnerable to polio, The Express Tribune reported.","Polio vaccination campaign in Pakistan's merged districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa fell short of its target.

Open Letter From Pakistan Backs India As Baloch Leader Signals Diplomatic Break With Islamabad





Baloch leader Mir Yar Baloch has raised a “serious threat” warning over deepening China–Pakistan ties, claiming that China could deploy its military forces in Pakistan’s Balochistan region in the coming months.In an open letter to external affairs minister S Jaishankar, posted on X on New Year’s Day, Mir Yar Baloch said Baloch representatives view the growing strategic partnership between Islamabad and Beijing as “dangerous.”He said Balochistan has “faced decades of repression under Pakistan’s control,” including what he described as “state-sponsored violence” and “human rights abuses.”""The people of Balochistan have endured Pakistan's state occupation, state-sponsored terrorism, and egregious human rights atrocities for the past seventy-nine years. The time has now arrived to eradicate this festering affliction at its roots, ensuring lasting peace and sovereignty for our nation, "" he wrote.In his letter to EAM Jaishankar, Mir Yar Baloch said that China and Pakistan are rapidly moving toward the final stages of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a major Belt and Road Initiative project led by Chinese President Xi Jinping that passes through Balochistan.“The Republic of Balochistan views the escalating strategic alliance between Pakistan and China as profoundly dangerous.We warn that China, in collaboration with Pakistan, has advanced the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) to its final phases,” he said.He warned that unless Baloch resistance and defence forces are strengthened, the region could soon see direct Chinese military involvement.“Should the capabilities of Balochistan's defense and freedom forces not be further bolstered and if they continue to be overlooked as per longstanding patterns, it is conceivable that China could deploy its military forces in Balochistan within a few months,” the letter stated.Mir Yar Baloch also said that any Chinese troop deployment without the approval of the local people could have serious consequences for the region.“The presence of Chinese boots on Balochistani soil without the will of the 60 million Baloch people would pose an unimaginable threat and challenge to the futures of both Bharat and Balochistan,” he wrote.China and Pakistan have repeatedly rejected claims that CPEC has a military angle, saying the project is only economic. India, however, has always opposed CPEC, pointing out that it passes through Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir and affects India’s sovereignty and security.Earlier this year in the Rajya Sabha, minister of state for external affairs Kirti Vardhan Singh repeated India’s stance. In a written reply, he said: “Government's position on CPEC is clear and consistent. Government has consistently protested to parties concerned over the inclusion of the so-called 'China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)', which passes through parts of the Indian Union Territories of Ladakh and Jammu & Kashmir under illegal occupation of Pakistan, as a flagship project of 'OBOR/BRI' and asked them to cease these activities. Any proposed participation of third countries or expansion of the so-called CPEC projects to third countries is unacceptable.”Mir Yar Baloch also praised India’s recent counterterror military actions, highlighting Operation Sindoor, which targeted key terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir after the Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 people.“We commend the bold and resolute actions undertaken by the Modi Government in the previous year through Operation Sindoor, particularly targeting terrorism hubs facilitated by Pakistan and directed against the Pakistani military in response to Pahalgam terror attack. These measures demonstrate exemplary courage and a steadfast commitment to regional security and justice,” he wrote.There has been no official response so far from the Union government, or from Chinese or Pakistani authorities, to Mir Yar Baloch’s claims.",Baloch leader Mir Yar Baloch has raised a “serious threat” warning over deepening China–Pakistan ties.

Why the annual exchange matters



Historical context



Limits of the agreement







NEW DELHI: India and Pakistan on Thursday exchanged, through diplomatic channels, the list of nuclear installations and facilities covered under the Agreement on the Prohibition of Attack against Nuclear Installations and Facilities, the ministry of external affairs said.The exchange took place simultaneously in New Delhi and Islamabad, in keeping with the provisions of the bilateral agreement that governs the protection of nuclear infrastructure in both countries.According to the MEA, the agreement requires India and Pakistan to inform each other of the nuclear installations and facilities covered under the pact on 1 January of every calendar year. Thursday’s exchange marked the 35th consecutive exchange of such lists, with the first taking place on 1 January 1992.The annual exchange has continued uninterrupted for over three decades, even during periods of heightened political and military tension between the two neighbours.The Agreement on the Prohibition of Attack against Nuclear Installations and Facilities was signed on 31 December 1988 and entered into force on 27 January 1991, following the exchange of instruments of ratification by both sides.Under the agreement, both India and Pakistan commit themselves to refrain from undertaking, encouraging or participating in any action aimed at causing destruction of, or damage to, nuclear installations or facilities in the other country.The scope of the agreement is broad. Nuclear installations and facilities covered under the pact include nuclear power plants, research reactors, fuel fabrication units, uranium enrichment facilities, isotope separation plants, reprocessing units and sites storing significant quantities of radioactive material, whether fresh or irradiated.The agreement also specifies that both countries must exchange information on the locations of these facilities, typically in the form of latitude and longitude coordinates, once every year.The annual exchange of lists is designed to reduce the risk of accidental, miscalculated or deliberate attacks on sensitive nuclear infrastructure during periods of conflict or crisis.By formally identifying protected sites, the agreement seeks to prevent scenarios in which conventional military operations could inadvertently escalate into a nuclear crisis. An attack on a nuclear installation, even with conventional weapons, could have catastrophic humanitarian, environmental and strategic consequences.Security analysts view the exchange as a confidence-building measure that helps maintain a minimum level of predictability between two nuclear-armed neighbours with a long history of conflict.Notably, the exchange has continued even during times of strained relations, including after major crises such as the Kargil conflict, the 2001–02 military standoff, the 2016 Uri attack and the 2019 Pulwama attack and Balakot air strikes.When the agreement was negotiated in the late 1980s, both India and Pakistan were moving steadily towards overt nuclear capability, though neither had yet conducted nuclear tests. Concerns over pre-emptive strikes on nuclear facilities, particularly in the context of regional instability, were central to the discussions.The agreement was one of the earliest formal nuclear confidence-building measures between the two countries and predated their 1998 nuclear tests, after which both openly declared themselves nuclear weapon states.Since entering into force in 1991, the agreement has remained intact despite the absence of progress on broader nuclear arms control or risk-reduction mechanisms in South Asia.While the pact prohibits attacks on nuclear installations and facilities, it does not restrict the development, deployment or use of nuclear weapons themselves. Nor does it include verification mechanisms beyond the annual exchange of lists.The agreement also does not cover missile bases, command and control centres or other strategic military assets linked to nuclear weapons.Even so, diplomats and experts argue that the continued observance of the agreement reflects a shared recognition of the dangers posed by attacks on nuclear infrastructure.More than three decades after it came into force, the agreement remains one of the few enduring pillars of nuclear risk reduction between India and Pakistan.In an environment marked by limited dialogue and recurring tensions, the uninterrupted annual exchange of nuclear installation lists serves as a reminder that both sides continue to acknowledge the need to prevent catastrophic escalation.For now, the routine exchange remains a rare example of sustained institutional cooperation between the two countries in the nuclear domain.","India and Pakistan exchange list of nuclear installations and facilities covered under the Agreement on the Prohibition of Attack against Nuclear Installations and Facilities.

ISLAMABAD: Traders across Pakistan have threatened a nationwide shutdown on January 16 if the government does not withdraw its decision to make the installation of Point of Sale (POS) machines mandatory, warning that the move would further burden small businesses and open new avenues for harassment by tax officials, as reported by Dawn.According to Dawn, the warning came during a protest rally held in Islamabad, where traders attempted to march from Aabpara Chowk towards the Red Zone to demonstrate against the Federal Board of Revenue's (FBR) directive.However, heavy police deployment stopped the procession near the Serena Hotel, forcing demonstrators to hold a sit-in at the spot.The protest was organised by the All Pakistan Anjuman-i-Tajran in collaboration with the Traders Action Committee and drew participation from shopkeepers and market representatives from Islamabad and Rawalpindi.Leaders of various trader bodies addressed the gathering, accusing the government of targeting small businesses instead of addressing large-scale corruption.Addressing the crowd, Ajmal Baloch, president of the Traders Action Committee in Islamabad, described the compulsory installation of POS machines as a ""black law"" designed to intimidate traders rather than reform the tax system.He claimed that under the guise of documentation, traders would be exposed to greater harassment and bribery demands by tax officials.Citing an International Monetary Fund assessment, Baloch alleged that corruption in Pakistan amounts to nearly PKR 53 trillion annually, with the FBR accounting for a major share.He accused the department of selectively targeting small shopkeepers while ignoring large-scale corruption.He also alleged that many FBR officials own assets beyond their known sources of income and that their families enjoy foreign education and luxurious lifestyles.The protest leaders also highlighted alleged irregularities in customs operations, claiming that consignments of legally imported goods had been seized and partially returned, while the rest allegedly disappeared, as highlighted by Dawn.Warning of tougher action ahead, the traders announced that if the government attempted to forcibly install POS machines or seal shops, they would block a major arterial road in Islamabad and stage a sit-in at Zero Point on January 16.They further threatened a countrywide shutdown strike if their demands were ignored.The protesters appealed to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to intervene and protect traders from what they described as arbitrary and heavy-handed actions by tax authorities, as reported by Dawn.","Traders across Pakistan have threatened a nationwide shutdown on January 16 if the government does not withdraw its decision to make the installation of Point of Sale (POS) machines mandatory.

According to local media, he previously served in the Pakistan Army as a captain before joining the civil administration through a quota reserved for army officers.He currently serves as an assistant commissioner.Munir has four daughters, and last week's ceremony marked the wedding of his third daughter.The wedding coincided with the arrival of UAE President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan in Pakistan on the same day, prompting speculation on social media about a possible link between the two events. However, Ghiskori said that the UAE president did not attend the wedding.Pakistan’s security and foreign policy under Munir remains critical. A report by Greek City Times said that global patience with Pakistan’s trajectory toward “religious extremism” was wearing thin, alleging that the country had moved toward a more theocratic posture while failing to curb radical elements at home.Another report by Asian News Post criticised Islamabad’s military-led approach to regional diplomacy, particularly in relation to Afghanistan, stating that the strategy had failed to stabilise borders or improve Pakistan’s international standing.","Munir has four daughters, and last week's ceremony marked the wedding of his third daughter.

Pakistan's former spy chief Faiz Hameed challenged his conviction by a military court which had sentenced him to 14 years in jail, media reports said on Monday.Hameed, the former chief of the powerful Inter-Services Intelligence, was convicted on December 11 by a Field General Court Martial (FGCM) on four counts - engaging in political activities, violating the Official Secrets Act, misusing authority and government resources, and causing wrongful loss to individuals.Hameed's lawyer Mian Ali Ashfaq confirmed that the appeal was filed two days ago, The Express Tribune newspaper reported.A separate application has also been submitted to the Court of Appeal's registrar at General Headquarters Pakistan Army, seeking a copy of the written decision, it said.""The appeal has already been filed,"" Ashfaq said, without disclosing the specific grounds raised in the challenge.Hameed was allowed to appeal against the sentence within 40 days, as given under Section 133-B of the Pakistan Army Act.The appeal will be heard by a Court of Appeals headed by a major general or a senior officer nominated by the army chief, who may uphold, modify or set aside the sentence.Hameed is being held at Special Prison Rawalpindi and has not been shifted to Adiala Jail, the report said.His conviction stems from a 2017 complaint filed by a property developer, who alleged that Hameed, then serving as a major general in the ISI, along with two other officers, raided his residence and business premises, confiscated valuables, and forced him to pay Rs 40 million while also funding a private television channel.The matter resurfaced in 2023 when the Supreme Court directed the property developer to approach the defence ministry, which subsequently instituted a Court of Inquiry in April 2024 to probe the allegations, leading to Hameed's arrest on August 12 that year.The FGCM proceedings commenced on August 12, 2024, and continued for around 15 months before the verdict was announced.Hameed retired from military service in November 2022, became the first former ISI director general to be tried by a military court and convicted.

Dar acknowledged that the strike caused damage to the military installation and injured personnel stationed there.Addressing reporters, Dar said India had launched multiple drone incursions into Pakistani territory within a short span, underlining the scale of the operation. “They (India) send drones towards Pakistan. In 36 hours, at least 80 drones were sent... We were able to intercept 79 drones out of 80, and only one drone damaged a military installation and personnel were also injured in the attack,” he claimed, according to news agency ANI.Also Read: 'Was advised to take shelter in bunker': Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari's big Op Sindoor admission - watch The foreign minister went on to describe the sequence of events following the strikes, saying that Pakistan’s civil and military leadership, led by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, held an emergency meeting on the night of May 9 to respond to the evolving situation.He added that India “made the mistake” of attacking the Nur Khan Air Base in the early hours of May 10, a remark that further acknowledged the strike and its impact.Dar’s comments amount to a rare public admission by a top Pakistani official of India’s military action on Pakistani air bases in May. The strikes came after Operation Sindoor, launched by the Indian Armed Forces to target nine terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir, in retaliation for the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam that killed 26 civilians.The Pakistan Air Force’s Nur Khan Air Base in Chaklala suffered significant damage during the Indian precision strikes. India had launched Operation Sindoor in the early hours of May 7 as a direct response to the Pahalgam attack.The escalation that followed saw increased cross-border shelling by Pakistan and retaliatory action by Indian forces. The situation later took an unexpected turn when Pakistan’s Director General of Military Operations contacted his Indian counterpart to propose a ceasefire, which India accepted. The outreach from the Pakistani side was later confirmed by Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri, who said both sides agreed to halt all military operations on land, at sea and in the air.Satellite imagery released by Maxar Technologies on May 13 showed significant damage to multiple Pakistani air bases, including Nur Khan Air Base. The images revealed damage at four installations: Nur Khan Air Base in Rawalpindi, PAF Base Mushaf in Sargodha, Bholari Air Base and PAF Base Shahbaz in Jacobabad. A comparison of satellite images taken on April 25 and May 10 showed clear damage to air base facilities, corroborating the strikes.This is not the first time a senior Pakistani leader has acknowledged the attack on Nur Khan Air Base. In May, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif admitted that Indian ballistic missiles had hit the base and other locations, breaking from Pakistan’s usual practice of denying Indian military action.Addressing a ceremony at the Pakistan Monument on May 16, Sharif said, “At around 2:30 am on May 10, General Syed Asim Munir called me on a secure line and informed me that India's ballistic missiles had hit Nur Khan Airbase and other areas. Our Air Force used homegrown technology to save our country, and they even used modern gadgets and technology on Chinese jets,” Geo News reported.",Pakistan FM Ishaq Dar Admits India Hit Nur Khan Air Base In Operation Sindoor Strikes.

Operation Sindoor

NEW DELHI: Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari admitted that he was urged to take shelter in a bunker for his safety during the four-day confrontation with India in May, a remark that underscored India’s prowess to strike deep into mainland Pakistan.According to Zardari, the advice came from his military secretary, though he claimed he refused to take shelter.“I had actually told him (secretary) four days earlier that a war was going to happen. But he came to me and said, ‘Sir, let’s go to the bunkers.’ I replied, ‘If martyrdom is to come, it will come here. Leaders don’t die in bunkers; they die on the battlefield. They don’t die sitting in bunkers,’” Zardari said on Saturday at a rally marking the death anniversary of his wife and former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, who was assassinated in 2007.He added that every worker of his Pakistan Peoples Party was ready to sacrifice his life for the nation.Zardari also responded to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “roti khao, varna meri goli toh hai hi” (eat your food peacefully, or else my bullet is waiting for you) warning to Pakistan, saying that it would be Pakistan that would fire the bullets.He further remarked that India may have an economy 10 times larger than Pakistan’s, but questioned where it would find the “courage” to fight a war.Indian armed forces launched Operation Sindoor on the intervening night of May 6–7 in retaliation for the Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 civilians. The strikes targeted nine terror facilities in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.Pakistan responded to the operation, triggering further retaliation by Indian forces, which subsequently struck around a dozen Pakistani air force bases.On May 10, Pakistan’s Director General of Military Operations contacted his Indian counterpart seeking a ceasefire, which was accepted.India has consistently maintained that Operation Sindoor has only been “halted” and would be resumed in the future if required.","Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari admitted that he was urged to take shelter in a bunker for his safety during the four-day confrontation with India in May.

Trump Puts Asim Munir On Gaza Test: Can Pak Army Chief Appease U.S & Avoid Backlash At Home?

Former Imran Khan aide Shahzad Akbar attacked in UK





Pakistan on Friday summoned Britain’s deputy high commissioner Matt Cannell after a video circulated online showing a woman at a rally in the UK referring to a possible attack on Pakistan Army chief General Asim Munir The ministry of foreign affairs called in Cannell to lodge a formal protest and demanded an investigation after the woman, speaking at a rally in Bradford in northern England, mentioned the possibility of the army chief being killed in a car bombing. Pakistani officials said the remarks went beyond political expression and raised serious security concerns.The rally was held in support of Pakistan’s jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan and was attended by his supporters living in the UK. Khan was removed from office through a no-confidence vote in April 2022 and has been in prison for nearly two years.The Bradford protest came days after a special court of Pakistan’s Federal Investigation Agency sentenced Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, to 17 years in prison each in the Toshakhana-II corruption case.According to Dawn, the court also imposed a fine of Pakistani Rs 16.4 million on each of them, with additional jail time possible in case of non-payment. The case relates to the alleged illegal retention and sale of state gifts received while Khan was in office.The video from the Bradford rally was initially shared on X by the UK chapter of Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party before being deleted.Explaining the decision, PTI UK said in a post on X: “We have removed a video from the recent Bradford protest featuring a citizen’s metaphorical remarks regarding General Asim Munir. Although we do not believe the individual incited violence, the post was deleted in an abundance of caution to prevent potential misunderstanding and legal safeguarding of the individual and her rights.”Pakistan’s deputy interior minister Talal Chaudhry said the remarks crossed a red line. Speaking to Geo Television, he said: “While Imran Khan’s party has been inciting supporters against the military, the car bomb threat at the Bradford rally crossed all limits. It does not fall into the category of freedom of speech.”He urged the UK government to investigate the incident and take legal action if laws were violated.Responding to Pakistan’s concerns, the UK High Commission in Islamabad said in a brief statement: “Where a foreign Government believes a crime has been committed, they should provide all relevant material to their UK police liaison. Any material that appears to break UK law will be reviewed by the police and may lead to a criminal investigation.”The diplomatic move comes amid escalating tensions between Khan’s supporters and Pakistan’s powerful military. Earlier this month, army spokesperson Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry described Khan as “mentally ill” during a press conference, after posts on Khan’s official X account referred to General Munir as “mentally unstable,” according to the Associated Press.Separately, tensions escalated further after PTI said Shahzad Akbar, a former adviser to Imran Khan was attacked in the United Kingdom on Thursday.In a post on X, Akbar said he was assaulted outside his home in Cambridge by an unidentified man.“Yesterday at approximately 8:08 a.m., I was attacked at my home by an unknown assailant dressed in what appeared to be construction or waste-collection attire,” Akbar wrote. “The individual asked, ‘Are you Shahzad Akbar?’ and immediately began assaulting me. The incident occurred in the presence of my family.”Akbar said he sustained facial injuries, including bruising and a fractured nose, and was taken to a local hospital before being discharged.“The police have taken cognizance of the matter and have assured me and my family that they are actively investigating this targeted attack and will work to apprehend both the perpetrator and those behind it,” he said.He added that he could not share further details at this stage, including CCTV footage, on the advice of authorities.“I have full faith in the rule of law and in British law enforcement to carry out their duties,” Akbar said, urging the UK government to ensure the safety of dissidents.In a follow-up statement, Akbar said the attack would not silence him.“I want to make one thing absolutely clear: If my views, political comments, or even my ‘face’ is not liked by anyone, such cowardly acts will only strengthen my resolve rather than silence me,” he wrote. “Violence will not intimidate me or deter me from speaking out.”The Pakistan government has previously submitted extradition documents to British authorities seeking Akbar’s return. Akbar, a PTI member, has been accused by the state of anti-government activities.",Pakistan summons Britain’s deputy high commissioner Matt Cannell.

'Just a junta with nuclear weapons': When Bush and Putin discussed Pakistan in 2005; what declassified NSA documents show,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/just-a-junta-with-nuclear-weapons-when-bush-and-putin-discussed-pakistan-in-2005-what-declassified-nsa-documents-show/articleshow/126187276.cms,"Putin Called Pakistan A Junta With Nukes As Bush Feared Nuclear Leaks To Iran, Reveal Transcripts





NEW DELHI: Pakistan’s nuclear proliferation programme triggered deep concern at the highest levels of the United States and Russia, with both countries expressing that Islamabad’s nuclear activities made them “nervous”, according to newly declassified documents released by the US National Security Archive.The documents, made public this week following a Freedom of Information lawsuit, include verbatim transcripts of meetings and phone calls between former US president George W Bush and Russian president Vladimir Putin between 2001 and 2008. They reveal repeated discussions on Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal, links to Iran’s nuclear programme, and the role of the AQ Khan proliferation network.In a key Oval Office meeting in 2005, Putin raised concerns over evidence suggesting Pakistani-origin uranium had been found in Iranian centrifuges, questioning Western tolerance of Islamabad despite its proliferation record.“But it's not clear what the labs (Iran) have, where they are. Cooperation with Pakistan still exists,” Putin said during the meeting.Bush responded by referring to his discussions with then Pakistani president Pervez Musharraf, saying, “I talked to Musharraf about that. I told him we're worried about transfers to Iran and North Korea. They put AQ Khan in jail, and some of his buddies under house arrest. We want to know what they said.I keep reminding Musharraf of that. Either he's getting nothing, or he's not being forthcoming.”Putin reiterated his concerns, stating, “As far as I understand, they found uranium of Pakistani origin in the centrifuges.”Bush acknowledged the issue, saying, “Yes, the stuff the Iranians forgot to tell the IAEA about. That's a violation.”“It was of Pakistani origin. That makes me nervous,” Putin said, to which Bush replied, “It makes us nervous, too.”Also read: 'I want Pak': Rajnath recalls Vajpayee's unmatched wit; all about iconic moment The documents also highlight Putin’s blunt assessment of Pakistan during an earlier meeting with Bush in Slovenia in 2001. “I am concerned about Pakistan. It is just a junta with nuclear weapons. It is no democracy, yet the West makes no criticism of it. Should talk about it,” Putin said.According to the transcripts, both leaders expressed anxiety about Pakistan’s internal political instability, its military-led governance under Musharraf, and the risk that sensitive nuclear technology could fall into the wrong hands. The discussions repeatedly returned to the AQ Khan network, which was later confirmed to have supplied nuclear technology to Iran, North Korea, and Libya.The declassified records underscore longstanding international concerns about Pakistan’s nuclear command and control systems and the broader implications of its proliferation activities.The revelations come amid renewed scrutiny of Pakistan’s nuclear conduct. Last month, India criticised Islamabad following remarks by US President Donald Trump alleging that Pakistan had been secretly testing nuclear weapons.Reacting to Trump’s comments, Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said such actions were consistent with Pakistan’s history. “Clandestine and illegal nuclear activities are in keeping with Pakistan's history, which is centred around decades of smuggling, export control violations, secret partnerships, AQ Khan network and further proliferation,” he said.“India has always drawn the attention of the international community to these aspects of Pakistan's record,” Jaiswal added."," transcripts of meetings and phone calls between former US president George W Bush and Russian president Vladimir Putin released by US National Security Archive.

Pak PM Sharif's Party Leader Threatens India, Warns Missiles Will Respond If Bangladesh Is Targeted





In a sharp attack on Pakistan’s security establishment, Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman accused the military leadership of employing a “double standard” regarding cross-border military operations. Speaking at a recent gathering in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the influential Deobandi cleric questioned the logical consistency of Pakistan’s defence policy, specifically contrasting Islamabad’s recent strikes in Afghanistan with its diplomatic outrage over Indian activities within Pakistani borders.He asked Pakistan’s military brass why India’s actions inside Pakistan should be condemned when Islamabad justifies strikes in Afghanistan by calling them attacks on its enemies. Rehman argued that if Pakistan claimed a sovereign right to launch pre-emptive or retaliatory strikes against perceived enemies on Afghan soil, it weakened its moral and legal standing when protesting similar actions by India. “We sent militants to Afghanistan for 20 years. .. from giving them Kalashnikovs to Cruise missiles... we empowered them in every way. When you bombed Kabul, it was as if someone had bombed your Islamabad.This is the limit, isn’t it? If you had bombed the remote areas, you might have been able to tolerate it. So, you took some action there as well...”“...If you say, and I have questions, that we have attacked the enemy’s headquarters and you call this a legitimate statement, India says to you that it has attacked Bahawalpur, it has attacked Muridke, it has attacked the headquarters of those who are operating against us in Kashmir. Why are you objecting to this? And if you object to this, and if you have the same claims against Afghanistan, how will you justify it..?”Rehman’s criticism comes at a time when Pakistan’s Field Marshal Asim Munir continues his anti-India rhetoric and claims that Pakistan received “divine help” during the military confrontation with India in May which was felt during the days of intense fighting that followed Indian strikes on terror targets.Rehman’s comments touch upon a sensitive nerve in geopolitics, specifically referring to locations like Bahawalpur and Muridke — areas long identified as hubs for terrorist groups like JeM and LeT — which were decimated during Operation Sindoor. By asking, “Why different rules for India?” Rehman highlighted the strategic hypocrisy: justification of “counterterrorism strikes” in the west, while demanding absolute territorial sanctity in the east.",Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman accused the military leadership of employing a “double standard” regarding cross-border military operations.

Red Bull's plans spark water scarcity fears near Berlin,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/red-bulls-plans-spark-water-scarcity-fears-near-berlin/articleshow/120841823.cms,"AI Image

No industry before reunification

Lack of sustainability

The small town of Baruth is just over an hour's train ride out of Berlin. Some 4,500 people live here and in the 12 surrounding villages that make up the municipality. Forests and a few fields dominate the landscape.Two years ago, energy drinks maker Red Bull and its partner Rauch took over operations from a mineral water company, acquiring its rights to 2.37 million cubic meters of groundwater each year.Up to now, the new owners have used less than half that amount. But uptake looks set to more than double under recently approved development plans.Brandenburg , which encircles the German capital, is one of the driest regions in the country. It's being hard hit by climate change . This winter, less rain fell here than in any other German state. Rising temperatures and changing rain patterns are also leading to increased water loss due to evaporation — and, as a result, sinking groundwater levels.Baruth's mayor Peter Ilk says there is enough water to go around: ""We are using a maximum of 25% of the water available. I don't believe that we are an area that will have any problems in the near future. We are talking in the region of maybe 30, 50 years,"" he told DW.Unter the existing permit, some 92% of the water being extracted by Baruth's local waterworks, WABAU, goes to the drinks manufacturers and 8% to the districts' residents. Under German law water is designated as common property and drinking water provision has priority over commercial needs.Freedom-of-information challenge to Red Bull plansOne citizen, who is concerned about the sustainability and transparency of the project, has launched a legal challenge to the plans with the help of a right-to-know platform ""Frag-den-Staat"" (ask the state). Lawyer Ida Westphal said that the aim was to get the local authority to disclose what Red Bull is getting in terms of subsidies and how much it is paying for the water.Mayor Ilk explained that water levels were closely monitored by Brandenburg's environmental agency and supplies to the drinks manufacturers could be throttled in the event of concern.Groundwater, however, remains a scientific black box, according to environmentalists, making it impossible to know how much exists deep underground and how quickly it is replenished. Over-extraction also carries the danger of contamination.Björn Ellner, from the German environmental association NABU, sees the situation critically. In an interview with DW, he said: ""In my view we cannot allow any water intensive industries to move to Brandenburg. In particular when groundwater is involved.""Richard Jacob, from the nature conservation organization BUND, told DW that Red Bull and Rauch's operations could only be ""tolerated"" in terms of job creation. ""Really, it's crazy what we are doing here. In dry Brandenburg we are producing these drinks in great quantities. And then we are transporting them by truck to Scandinavia where there is plenty of water available. Or to eastern Europe where there is plenty of water.""In the 1990s, there was no industry to speak of here in what was communist East Germany. Baruth's mayor Peter Ilk is proud of the gleaming enterprise zone that he has helped build up right outside town and the employment opportunities that he has created.By bringing Red Bull and Rauch to the town, he said some 300 jobs had been saved and that another 150 to 200 would be created under the new plans. The municipality will get a €14-million ($15.9 mio) grant from the state of Brandenburg to build a water treatment plant for Red Bull and Rauch, the mayor added.""It is sustainable, alone by dint of the fact that we have secured jobs here,"" said Ilk. He said residents should not all be forced to make the 70-kilometer (43.5 miles) journey to Berlin or elsewhere, but should be able to get jobs locally. But the mayor also conceded that Baruth's biggest problem was attracting families with children to the area because of a lack of living space and building land. Much of the surrounding countryside is designated as a conservation area.Shoppers outside one of Baruth's local supermarkets, told DW they support the employment opportunities that he is creating and the tax influx to the town. However, some voice criticism of the ""non-European"" workers that the development has reportedly brought to the town, or regard the chopping down of 16 hectares of forest to make way for an aluminum canning plant as incompatible with the town's sustainability agenda. None of them want their names published.Red Bull also gets its water from Austria and Switzerland. In 2023, it was nominated for a booby prize for ""transport nonsense"" by the Swiss environmental organization ""Alpen-Initiative"" for shipping water extracted in the Alps in the form of energy drinks all the way round the world. Many drinks manufacturers export just the syrups, which are then mixed with water locally.Concern about the expansion of the soft drinks plant has been fueled by reports from Grünheide, also in Brandenburg. US automaker Tesla set up a huge plant there several years ago — and there have been protests about its heavy water consumption and the razing of forests.Workers from 150 different nations now work at the Tesla plant in Grünheide. Many commute from Berlin or across the Polish border. Works council chairwoman Michaela Schmitz told rbb public radio that most of the employees come from Germany, Turkey, Poland, Syria and India.","Two years ago, energy drinks maker Red Bull and its partner Rauch took over operations from a mineral water company.

Turkey: Legal control as a weapon against journalists,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/turkey-legal-control-as-a-weapon-against-journalists/articleshow/120841724.cms,"Representative Image

A protective measure or an unfair punishment?

Increasing numbers of journalists face restrictions

A bid to silence potential critics?

For years, Turkey has been making international headlines for it's lackluster track record on press freedom and freedom of speech: Turkey is ranked 159th out of 180 in the latest Reporters Without Borders Press Freedom Index. According to the Turkish Journalists' Union, 18 journalists were in prison at the end of March.However, the restrictions on press freedom are by no means limited to imprisonment: Judicial restrictions are also part of a repressive system designed to systematically silence critical voices. Measures including house arrest, bans on leaving the country, and obligations to report regularly to the authorities are increasingly being used as a means of exerting pressure.Originally intended as an alternative to pre-trial detention, they are becoming an instrument of de facto punishment — especially for journalists.Hundreds of journalists are not in prison, but at home, no longer allowed to practice their profession. Recently, many well-known media professionals in Turkey have been subjected to such treatment.According to the law, judicial inspections are intended to prevent suspects from escaping or tampering with evidence. They are used in cases where there is a strong suspicion of a crime and officials see a risk of people trying to flee the law or conceal their identities. However, such measures are also increasingly being used in the wake of accusations of libel for example or posting critical social media posts, in other words, for offences that do not fall into the ""catalog of crimes"" defined in law.Veysel Ok , a lawyer who has represented many journalists in Turkey — including German daily Die Welt correspondent Deniz Yücel — no longer sees judicial control as a straightforward means of safeguarding proceedings, but as a ""penalty-like sanction.""""By law, these measures may only be imposed if the conditions for imprisonment are met. But this is often ignored in practice,"" explained Ok. Court orders have now become the norm, he said, especially in cases relating to freedom of expression.""Some are confined to their homes for years and can no longer work as journalists. Even if they are acquitted in the end, they have spent their most productive years under these restrictions,"" said the lawyer. Even social media posts or political criticism can trigger such measures.""In the past, this was not so common,"" said Ok. ""Today, control measures are imposed automatically — in political cases, against protesters or even against journalists. Almost everyone under investigation is now subject to some form of restriction.""This includes measures such as house arrest or bans on leaving the country, which prevent media professionals from doing their job. These, Ok said, also violate d the decisions of the Constitutional Court . He highlighted the case of activist Nurcan Kaya , in which the court ruled that such measures were only permissible if there were valid grounds for detention. Despite this, the practice continues, he said.These measures have two objectives, explained Ok: ""On the one hand, those involved are punished before a verdict has even been reached. The second goal is to create a climate of fear in a society that suppresses freedom of expression.""The overcrowded prisons in Turkey also encouraged the spread of judicial control, he explained. ""There are currently over 400,000 people in prison. But hundreds of thousands are living in detention-like conditions — in their city or their home. They are not arrested, but controlled — it is a method that has long since become a punishment.""Erol Onderoglu, the head of Reporters Without Borders (RSF) in Turkey, is also concerned, viewing the widespread practice of judicial control as a direct attack on the right to free reporting, as well as a curtailing of the population's ability to inform itself freely.According to Onderoglu, judicial inspections should only be applied in exceptional cases, for example when particularly serious accusations have been made. But in Turkey, a simple libel charge or a social media post is now enough to trigger restrictions on journalists.For Onderoglu, the impact of this is clear: ""This unlawful practice serves to deliberately harass and intimidate critical journalists. It is an expression of a preemptive will to punish.""","Turkey is ranked 159th out of 180 in the latest Reporters Without Borders Press Freedom Index.

Rise of independent candidates

A new generation of voters

Australians began voting on Saturday in a closely contested national election shaped by concerns over the cost of living, climate policy, and tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump.From remote desert towns to cities along the coast, millions of Australians are casting their votes to choose between the current Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and the opposition leader Peter Dutton .Most opinion polls in the days before the election suggested that Albanese’s Labor Party was likely to win a second term in government.""I'll leave nothing on the field over the next three years if I'm re-elected as Australia's prime minister,"" Albanese told Channel Seven on Saturday morning.The election is being fought between Anthony Albanese, who leads the Labor Party, and Peter Dutton, the head of the Liberal Party.Both leaders come from working-class backgrounds, which is different from many earlier leaders who often had degrees from top universities or had worked in banking or law.Albanese, who is 62 years old, grew up with his single mother in a small government-subsidised apartment in inner-city Sydney. He spent much of his youth helping to care for his mother Maryanne, who suffered from severe rheumatoid arthritis.Dutton, who is 54, is the son of a bricklayer and was raised in the suburbs of Brisbane. After leaving university early, he joined the state police and also worked for a short time in a butcher's shop. Dutton became a detective in the drugs squad, which he says influenced his strict views on law enforcement and security.A total of 18.1 million people have registered to vote in the election. According to the election commission, over one-third of them have already voted early.In Australia, voting is mandatory and enforced through a fine of Aus$20 (US$13), which results in voter turnout rates exceeding 90 percent.The outcome of the election might be known as early as Saturday night, unless the race is extremely close.Annual inflation reached 7.8 per cent in the year following Labor’s 2022 election win. Two weeks before the change in government, the central bank lifted its key interest rate from a historic low of 0.1 per cent to 0.35 per cent . Since then, the rate has been raised 12 times, reaching 4.35 per cent in November 2023.In February, the central bank lowered the inflation rate slightly to 4.1 per cent , suggesting that the toughest period of financial pressure might be over. Another rate cut is widely expected at the bank’s next board meeting on May 20, amid global economic uncertainty linked to US President Donald Trump’s tariff decisions.Meanwhile, housing prices and rents have climbed sharply, with several construction companies collapsing as inflation has reduced their profit margins.Although Australia has some of the biggest uranium reserves in the world, it has kept an almost complete ban on nuclear power since 1998.Peter Dutton wants to change that by removing the ban and starting a nuclear energy industry from the beginning. He believes that nuclear power is the only dependable way for Australia to cut emissions over the long term and is cautious about relying on renewable energy sources.Anthony Albanese has taken a different approach by putting government funds into solar energy, wind power, and manufacturing focused on clean energy. He has promised to turn Australia into a global leader in renewable energy.The decision by US President Donald Trump to place tariffs on Australian goods may have slightly boosted support for Albanese in recent opinion polls.Some polls suggested that Dutton lost support because of Trump, whom Dutton had earlier called a ""big thinker"" with ""gravitas"" on the international stage.Both leaders have since taken stronger positions on the matter.""If I needed to have a fight with Donald Trump, or any other world leader, to advance our nation's interest, I'd do it in a heartbeat,"" Dutton said in April.Albanese criticised Trump’s tariffs, calling them an act of “economic self-harm” and “not the act of a friend”.""He has different views, different values,"" the prime minister said in a televised debate.""I support free and fair trade. He doesn't.""For decades, Australian politics has mainly been shaped by two major groups: the Labor Party, led by Albanese, and the Liberal Party, led by Dutton.But in recent years, more voters have turned to independent candidates, many of whom are calling for more government openness and stronger action on climate change.Labor held a small lead in polls going into the election, but if the final vote count is very close, a group of at least 10 independent and crossbench members could end up deciding who gets to form the government. That could lead to the creation of a minority government, something that does not happen often in Australia.Both political parties have directed their campaigns at Australia’s changing population. This election is the first time that people born after 1964 outnumber the Baby Boomers, who were born between the end of World War II and 1964.A big focus for both campaigns has been on helping first-home buyers, especially younger people, enter the housing market, which has become too expensive for many.","A new generation of voters began voting on Saturday in a closely contested national election. The election is being fought between Anthony Albanese, who leads the Labor Party, and Peter Dutton, the head of the Liberal Party.

TAIPEI: Taiwan detected seven sorties of People's Liberation Army (PLA) aircraft, seven People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) vessels and one ship operating near Taiwan until 6 am (local time) on Saturday.According to Taiwan's Ministry of ntional defence (MND), all seven sorties crossed the median line of the Taiwan Strait and entered Taiwan's northern and southwestern Air Defence Identification Zone (ADIZ).In response to Chinese activity, Taiwan's armed forces deployed aircraft, naval ships, and coastal missile systems to monitor the situation.Sharing a post on X, MND wrote, ""7 sorties of PLA aircraft, 7 PLAN vessels and 1 official ship operating around Taiwan were detected up until 6 a.m. (UTC+8) today. 7 out of 7 sorties crossed the median line and entered Taiwan's northern and southwestern ADIZ. We have monitored the situation and responded.""On Friday, MND detected five sorties of PLA aircraft, seven PLAN vessels and one ship operating near Taiwan until 6 am (local time).One out of five sorties crossed the median line of the Taiwan Strait and entered Taiwan's southwestern ADIZ.This incident follows a recent pattern of escalated manoeuvres by China around Taiwan, sparking concerns over regional stability as Beijing continues to assert its claims over the island. Taiwan has been governed independently since 1949. However, China considers Taiwan part of its territory and insists on eventual reunification, by force if necessary.China and Taiwan have frequently accused one another of spying, and Taiwan has arrested several people it says Beijing has hired to get intelligence or sway public opinion. According to RFA, Beijing usually rejects any role in espionage operations against Taiwan, referring to the charges as ""politically motivated"" or ""groundless.Meanwhile, a survey conducted by the Carter Center and Emory University in Atlanta revealed that over half of the Chinese population opposed using force to unify with Taiwan under any circumstances, as reported by Taipei Times.The findings, released on Wednesday in a report titled ""Sovereignty, Security, and US-China Relations: Chinese Public Opinion,"" indicated that 55.1 per cent of participants either agreed or somewhat agreed that ""the Taiwan issue should not be resolved through force under any circumstances. In comparison, 24.5 per cent either 'strongly or somewhat' disagreed with this statement, according to Taipei Times.

WASHINGTON: US transportation secretary Sean Duffy said Friday that it is ""unacceptable"" that two commercial aircrafts had to abort landings at a Washington airport this week because of an Army Black Hawk helicopter that was flying to the Pentagon.In addition to the National Transportation Safety Board and Federal Aviation Administration investigating what happened Thursday afternoon, Duffy said, he plans to talk to the department of defense to determine why rules were ""disregarded.""The incident at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport involved a Delta Air Lines Airbus A319 and a Republic Airways Embraer E170, according to the NTSB.

""We just lost 67 souls! No more helicopter rides for VIPs or unnecessary training in a congested DCA airspace full of civilians. Take a taxi or Uber - besides most VIPs have black car service.""The aborted landings follow a deadly midair collision in January between a passenger jet and Army helicopter in Washington that killed 67 people.In March, the FAA announced that helicopters would be permanently restricted from flying near Washington's airport on the same route where the collision occurred. It wasn't immediately clear if the helicopter flying Thursday was in the restricted area.The FAA, which manages the nation's airspace and oversees aviation safety, has come under criticism after the NTSB said there had been an alarming number of near misses in recent years in the congested skies around Reagan National.The closure of the helicopter route near the airport makes permanent the restrictions put in place after the Jan. 29 midair collision. The FAA order includes a few exceptions for helicopter use, including presidential flights along with law enforcement and lifesaving missions.Democratic Senator Maria Cantwell, ranking member of the Commerce Committee, which oversees the FAA, said about the Thursday incident that ""it is far past time"" for defense secretary Pete Hegseth and the FAA to ""give our airspace the security and safety attention it deserves.""Emma Johnson, a spokesperson for Delta Air Lines, said that the safety of their customers and all people is most important and that they'll ""cooperate with authorities as they investigate.""Republic Airways said in a statement that it is also cooperating with the investigations.The US Army did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",Two commercial aircrafts had to abort landings at a Washington airport this week because of an Army Black Hawk helicopter.

Brinkmanship

'A lot trickier'

WASHIBGTON: President Donald Trump spent his first 100 days issuing a blitz of executive orders to deliver rapidly on campaign pledges, drastically downsize the government and reshape America's role on the global stage.But the job gets trickier now for the self-styled dealmaker-in-chief, who must corral fractious Republicans on Capitol Hill to anchor his domestic policies in legislation that can cement a lasting legacy.""Trump's first 100 days were remarkable for their pace and impact. Now comes the hard part,"" Stephen Dover, chief market strategist and head of the Franklin Templeton Institute, said in a memo to investors.""The next 100 days will shift the focus to the challenges of passing legislation while simultaneously addressing deficit reduction. Congress must act, which requires building legislative coalitions.""In a dizzying first three months, Trump wielded executive power like no other modern president, signing more than 140 orders on immigration, culture war issues and slashing the federal bureaucracy .But the unilateral authority of the Oval Office has its limits and much of the reform Trump wants to enact -- particularly anything involving spending public money -- requires laws to be passed by Congress.Trump's political capital will be put to the test as he aims to shepherd his sprawling agenda on tax, border security and energy production through the House and Senate.Complicating Trump's task is his receding popularity, with the polls flashing warning signs amid economic uncertainty and misgivings over his handling of immigration and international trade.Executive orders signed without the involvement of Congress can be undone by any president.They are also vulnerable to legal and constitutional challenges, as Trump has discovered in dozens of rulings that blocked his policies early in his presidency.A more lasting impact, say analysts, will require the kind of political brinkmanship and consensus-building that haven't been necessary so far.The author of ""The Art of the Deal"" doesn't have a great record of getting contentious legislation through his divided party.In his 2017-21 term, he passed the Abraham Accords, fostering peace between Israel and several of its neighbors, and celebrated a trade deal with Canada that has since been obliterated by his tariffs.But he failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare -- a key priority -- and, despite much fanfare over summits in Singapore and Hanoi, was unable to ink any kind of deal with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.When it comes to uniting around a common cause, his lawmakers in Congress haven't fared much better, getting just five bills into law in Trump's first 100 days, the lowest number in generations.Republicans set a deadline of July 4 to pass the president's agenda -- led by an extension of his 2017 tax cuts and fulfilling a campaign pledge to eliminate levies on tips, overtime and Social Security payments.The slim Republican majorities in both chambers will require almost perfect unity.But conservatives won't back the tax cuts -- which have an estimated price tag of around $5 trillion over 10 years -- without deep reductions in spending.Moderates with tough reelection fights in next year's midterms say they won't support the likely evisceration of the Medicaid health insurance program for low-income families that this would entail.Political consultant and former Senate aide Andrew Koneschusky, a key player in negotiations over the 2017 tax cuts, expects Trump's next 100 days to be ""a lot trickier.""""When it comes to tax bills, the ultimate adult in the room is math. You can't break the laws of mathematics, no matter how much politicians might want to,"" he told AFP.""It's going to be extremely tricky for the numbers to add up in a way that satisfies everyone in the Republican caucus.""Meanwhile Trump is up against the clock.The battle for the House majority in 2026 will likely come down to a few swing districts and the president could easily see his ability to shepherd legislation through Congress curtailed.Trump is relying on an arcane Senate procedure called ""reconciliation"" that means, given certain conditions are satisfied, he won't need Democratic support to pass his priorities -- which is just as well.House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has called Trump's agenda ""unconscionable"" and ""un-American,"" vowing to do everything Democrats can to ""bury it in the ground, never to rise again.""",President Donald Trump spent his first 100 days issuing a blitz of executive orders.

He expressed confidence that ICE would respect her deportation stay order whilst the case transfers to Texas federal court.""OK,"" the judge responded. ""I'm not going to rely on that. But thank you,"" she added.In a court filing ahead of the hearing, US attorneys argued that Badar Khan Suri’s lawsuit should have been filed in Texas, not Virginia, since he was already moved out of the state. They called the transfer a ""straightforward"" legal matter.The Trump administration said it relocated Khan Suri from a detention center in Farmville, Virginia, to Louisiana and then Texas due to overcrowding.However, the judge Giles appeared doubtful about that explanation. She asked the government to provide specific data on how many beds were available in Farmville at the time of Suri’s arrest and how many detainees have actually been transferred for overcrowding.Khan Suri's attorneys from the American Civil Liberties Union told the judge that he initially slept on the floor in an overcrowded Texas facility for several weeks, though he now occupies an individual cell.His legal representatives suggested the transfer to Texas aimed to secure a more conservative judicial hearing. Attorney Vishal Agraharkar accused the government of engaging in ""forum shopping.""The federal courts in Texas and western Louisiana feature predominantly Republican-appointed judges, unlike Alexandria, Virginia's US District Court.Appeals proceed to the conservative-leaning 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals. The 5th Circuit, one of 13 federal appellate courts nationwide, comprises 17 full-time judges. Twelve received appointments from Republican presidents, including six during Donald Trump's presidency.Outside the Alexandria courthouse on Thursday, Hassan Ahmad, another lawyer representing Khan Suri, reinforced Agraharkar's courtroom statements. ""There is a reason why the detention facilities exist there,"" Ahmad said, further noting that, ""This kind of rigged game has to stop,"" he said.His legal team said that his arrest and imprisonment were unconstitutional, stemming from his wife's Gaza connections. They assert that Khan Suri and his spouse, Mapheze Saleh, faced targeting because Saleh's father worked with Gaza's Hamas-supported administration before the October 7, 2023 attack on Israel.Badar Khan Suri, an Indian citizen, came to the US in 2022 on a J-1 visa and works at Georgetown University as a visiting scholar and postdoctoral fellow.He and his wife Saleh have three children—a 9-year-old son and 5-year-old twins.

The United States defence department announced on Thursday the establishment of a second military zone along the Mexican border for immigration law enforcement .The new zone, situated in Texas and connected to El Paso's Fort Bliss Army base, follows the pattern of the first zone created in New Mexico last month. Military personnel in these areas are authorised to detain migrants crossing illegally until U.S. Department of Homeland Security officials take charge.Gen. Gregory Guillot, US Northern Command commander, stated: ""The establishment of a second National Defense Area increases our operational reach and effectiveness in denying illegal activity along the southern border.""On Monday, individuals who entered the U.S. illegally faced charges for breaching a national defence area in New Mexico, where the Army oversees a 170-mile (274-kilometre) stretch considered an extension of U.S. Army Garrison Fort Huachuca, Arizona.Military officials were unavailable Thursday night to specify the dimensions of the new Texas zone, which was not detailed in their press release.Those crossing the border in these military zones could face prosecution for two federal offences: illegal U.S. entry and military property trespassing. This development coincides with the Trump administration's deployment of thousands of troops to the border, while arrests have decreased to levels not seen since the mid-1960s.These military zones enable the federal government to operate outside the constraints of an 1878 law restricting military involvement in civilian law enforcement.Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, during a recent New Mexico visit, explained: ""Any illegal attempting to enter that zone is entering a military base, a federally protected area. You will be interdicted by U.S. troops and Border Patrol.""",The new zone is situated in Texas and connected to El Paso's Fort Bliss Army base.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio, 53, has been appointed acting national security adviser, while Trump, 78, oversees the transition, New York Post reported.Administration insiders suggest Miller's candidacy stems from his strict immigration stance, which aligns with Trump's key policy priorities both domestically and internationally.""He has been instrumental in the deportation effort and he and Rubio are aligned in stopping the cartels and the dictator regimes that they answer to, and he's probably the only one with the gravitas to actually finish the job,"" a source revealed to The Post.""I think Stephen is beyond brilliant.""Miller's prominent role during Trump's initial 100 days included regular media engagements at the White House briefing room and driveway press encounters.A White House insider noted, ""He would be an excellent choice. Not only is he great in policy but he knows how to manage government on a day-to-day basis. And he works well with Rubio, specifically on immigration and terror threat in the western hemisphere.""However, another source questioned Miller's suitability, stating: ""It's too much of a full-time job [and] would take away from the things that he actually likes.""Additional candidates include Michael Anton, White House policy planning director, reportedly favoured by Vice President JD Vance. Sebastian Gorka, senior counterterrorism director; Steve Witkoff, special Middle East envoy; and Ric Grenell, special envoy for special missions and former acting intelligence director and German ambassador under Trump, are also under consideration.","Stephen Miller, President Trump's senior policy and homeland security adviser, could succeed Mike Waltz as national security adviser.

A 73-year-old landlord from Illinois has been given a 53-year prison sentence for the fatal stabbing of a six-year-old Palestinian-American child and seriously injuring the boy's mother.In February, Joseph Czuba was found guilty of murder and hate crimes for killing Wadee Alfayoumi and attacking his mother Hanan Shaheen in 2023, following the outbreak of the Israel-Gaza conflict, BBC news reported.The victims were residing as tenants in Czuba's property in Plainfield, situated approximately 64 km from Chicago. The prosecution established that he attacked them because of their Islamic faith.Despite pleading not guilty, a jury reached a guilty verdict in under 90 minutes.At Friday's court proceedings, Wadee Alfayoumi's great uncle, Mahmoud Yousef, stated that no punishment could adequately address the child's death, as reported by NBC News.He spoke about the father's memories and plans for his son, which Czuba had wrongfully taken away. The elderly convict, appearing thin and weak in his red prison attire, chose to remain silent.The court heard testimony from the victim's mother, who provided distressing details of the attack, while Czuba's former wife testified about his increasing agitation regarding the war.Hanan Shaheen's testimony revealed that Czuba had declared ""you, as a Muslim, must die"", according to Reuters.The prosecution detailed how Czuba forcibly entered the family's rented accommodation and attacked them with a knife. The mother sustained over twelve stab wounds, whilst the young boy was stabbed 26 times.The evidence presented included disturbing crime scene photographs, and police testimony described finding Czuba outside the property with blood covering his body and hands.This lethal assault garnered nationwide attention and highlighted concerns about Islamophobia, anti-Muslim discrimination, and anti-Palestinian sentiment.The young victim had celebrated his sixth birthday shortly before his death.Ahmed Rehab, executive director of CAIR's Chicago office, remembered the boy's love for his family, friends, and sports including football and basketball.","Joseph Czuba, 73, found guilty of murder and hate crimes.

Caught on camera: Mike Waltz using less secure version of Signal messaging app,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/caught-on-camera-mike-waltz-using-less-secure-version-of-the-signal-messaging-app/articleshow/120833125.cms,"Mike Waltz and the controversy seem to go together for a little longer, as a new photo emerged showing the former national security advisor using a modified and less secure version of the Signal messaging app, TM SGNL, raising fresh security concerns.Yesterday, US President Donald Trump removed Waltz from his position and nominated him for the UN ambassador after the Signal chat leak and now this photo pushed him into controversy's whirl.Reuters photographs from April 30 captured Waltz's phone screen displaying conversations with several high-ranking officials, including JD Vance, Marco Rubio, Tulsi Gabbard, and Steve Witkoff. These officials hold crucial positions in managing foreign relations and national security matters, including negotiations with Vladimir Putin regarding the Ukraine conflict.The images were taken at a White House cabinet meeting in Washington DC on April 30, 2025. The modified application, TM SGNL, is developed by TeleMessage, a company that replicates messaging applications with additional archiving capabilities.According to 404 Media's analysis, whilst this archiving feature might help comply with presidential record-keeping requirements, it potentially compromises the end-to-end encryption that makes standard Signal secure, as messages can be retrieved from storage.Visible in the photographs were partial message contents, including a message to ""Rubio"" stating ""there is time"" and one from ""Vance"" reading ""I have confirmation from my counterpart it's turned off. He is going to be here in ..."" The screen also showed evidence of a call to Gabbard and an 8am ""PDB"" meeting schedule.Following these events, Trump reassigned Waltz to the position of UN ambassador on Thursday, with Rubio assuming the role of interim national security adviser.

In the ongoing Maryland's Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, a new audio emerged where his wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura , who is seen currently defending her husband's innocence, in 2020 had previously sought protection from her husband, citing numerous instances of domestic violence before a Maryland judge.The 2020 audio revealed that Vasquez Sura described multiple incidents of physical abuse by Abrego Garcia, resulting in numerous police reports and visible bruises. She mentioned an earlier attempt to obtain a protective order was thwarted when his family convinced her against it, citing his father's illness.Vasquez Sura detailed an incident where Abrego Garcia pushed her near their basement, prompting her to call 911 and seek help from a neighbour. She recounted how police took ""20, 30 minutes"" to arrive, and during this time, Abrego Garcia allegedly assaulted her in front of the neighbour.She described additional incidents of violence, including early morning attacks and being struck at their daughter's birthday celebration. She also reported that her sister witnessed and reported an assault.Addressing the resurfaced audio, Vasquez Sura told USA Today that both parties were struggling at the time, citing COVID-19 pressures and Abrego Garcia's trauma from ICE detention .Court documents reveal Vasquez Sura sought protective orders in 2020 and 2021, with allegations including threats to her life and severe physical abuse resulting in injuries.Despite an immigration judge's protection from deportation, ICE deported Abrego Garcia to El Salvador with 260 other suspected gang members. His legal representation maintains his innocence regarding gang associations.Initially held in CECOT prison, Abrego Garcia was later transferred to a lower-security facility. The justice department acknowledged his deportation resulted from an ""administrative error"", though the Trump administration maintains he had no legal right to remain in the US.A Maryland federal judge ordered efforts to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return, supported by both appeals court and Supreme Court decisions. However, the administration states it cannot guarantee successful negotiations for his release from foreign custody.","Kilmar Abrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador with 260 other suspected gang members.

ICE memo allowing visa-based SEVIS terminations comes under fire as class-action suit seeks urgent relief,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ice-memo-allowing-visa-based-sevis-terminations-comes-under-fire-as-class-action-suit-seeks-urgent-relief/articleshow/120830241.cms,"Legal claims made:

First cause of action:

Second cause of action:

Third cause of action

Fourth cause of action:

Nearly 351 international students, many of whom are Indians, have filed a second-amended class action suit, which in addition to the unlawful SEVIS terminations and visa revocations also challenges the recent memo issued by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) on SEVIS termination.As covered by TOI in its edition of May 1, as per the new memo, student visa revocations by the US Department of State (DOS), which are not subject to court challenge can be a ground to terminate an international student’s ‘Student and Exchange Visitor Information System’ (SEVIS) record.Also read: Reinstated international students at risk again after new ICE memo on SEVIS terminations Typically, F-1 visa holders (international students undergoing academic studies) are allowed to remain in the US for the duration of their academic program plus an additional 60-day grace period. However, if a student's SEVIS record is terminated, this grace period no longer applies, potentially leading to immediate loss of legal status and the need to depart the US immediately.Based on the memo, revocation of a F-1 visa would result in SEVIS termination leaving the students in a precarious situation. “A visa revocation should not, legally, impact a student’s immigration status in the US, yet such a revocation will be treated by ICE in a manner that constructively terminates that student’s status by cutting off the ability to work, to study, and to change immigration statuses within the US (say from student visa to work visa)”, points out the lawsuit complaint.Greg Siskind , one of the attorneys involved in this case had pointed out that “DOS could revoke a visa for phantom reasons with no due process to address why revocation happened. The Trump Administration is counting on the argument that nothing DOS decides is reviewable by a court.”It appears to be the first lawsuit to be filed against Marco Rubio , in his capacity as Secretary Department of State (DOS), in addition to the acting director of ICE and Secretary, DHS. Previous lawsuits have only covered ICE and DHS.In their lawsuit complaint filed in a US district court (Northern District of Georgia), the plaintiffs (351 international students who proceeded with the lawsuit pseudonymously) point out that the ICE-memo, constitutes a legislative rule that was unlawfully promulgated without following the required notice-and-comment process under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The memo reportedly introduced a new policy allowing the termination of SEVIS records in the event of a visa revocation, which the plaintiffs argue is inconsistent with existing regulations and represents a drastic shift in ICE's long-standing policy.They contend that between 4,000 and 8,000 students across the US had their SEVIS records unlawfully terminated by (ICE), a bureau of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). These terminations were carried out by automated systems, without proper legal authority or procedural due process, and occurred just weeks before key academic milestones like semester-end or graduation.ICE lacked statutory or regulatory authority to initiate such terminations under the applicable regulations, which allows termination only in three narrow and specific cases, viz: revocation of a previous waiver, introduction of a private bill for permanent residence or notification in a federal register identifying national security, diplomatic, or public safety reasons for termination. Visa revocation is not one of the grounds for SEVIS termination under the regulations.The plaintiffs asserts that the memo unlawfully expands ICE's authority to terminate SEVIS records without regard for whether students are complying with their F-1 visa requirements under the regulations and without adhering to the regulatory bases for termination covered by the regulations.The lawsuit complaint goes on to explain that in April 2025, after facing over 50 lawsuits challenging the SEVIS terminations, ICE announced partial reactivations of SEVIS records—but explicitly excluded students whose visas had been revoked by the DOS, despite the fact that many revocations stemmed from the SEVIS terminations themselves. ICE also issued a new policy on April 26, 2025, attempting to justify SEVIS terminations based on visa revocations, asserting removability. Plaintiffs argue this constitutes unlawful and retroactive policy-making.They allege collusion between ICE and the DOS to maximize the punitive impact of these actions, and assert that such conduct violates federal regulations and constitutional due process.Impact Litigation firms (Bless Litigation, Joseph and Hall, Kuck Baxter and Siskind Susser ) are representing the students.In their lawsuit, the international students are asking the district court to take several major actions to undo what they describe as unlawful and damaging SEVIS terminations and/or visa revocations. They plead that the case should be treated as class-action on behalf of all affected students whose SEVIS records were terminated after March 24, 2025, without legal justification. The mass termination of SEVIS should be treated as illegal and the termination cancelled. Students’ immigration status should be restored to what it was before the terminations, including restoring any valid visas and work authorizations. International students who have been impacted should be allowed to apply for work permits under the Optional Practical Training Program, even if they missed the deadlines because of the actions of the US agencies. Any harmful or incorrect information should be deleted from government databases that could wrongly label students as criminals or immigration violators. The new ICE policy that allows SEVIS records to be terminated based solely on VISA revocations should be struck down.The SEVIS terminations and visa revocations were arbitrary, capricious, and unlawful under the APA.The actions violated the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause by depriving students of their rights without notice or a meaningful opportunity to be heard.: ICE's memo dated April 26, permitting SEVIS terminations based on visa revocations was an unlawfully promulgated legislative rule.The Secretary of State exceeded statutory authority by coordinating mass visa revocations, violating the Immigration and Nationality Act and the non-delegation doctrine.","Nearly 351 international students, many of whom are Indians, have filed a second-amended class action suit. The lawsuit challenges the recent memo issued by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) on SEVIS termination.

PBS chief calls Donald Trump's order to cut public media funds 'unlawful',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/pbs-chief-calls-donald-trumps-order-to-cut-public-media-funds-unlawful/articleshow/120831981.cms,"Paula Kerger, President and CEO at PBS (Image: AP)

Paula Kerger, president & CEO of US public broadcasting service (PBS) on Friday criticised President Donald Trump for his latest executive order which seeks to cut federal funding for PBS and National Public Radio (NPR).Paula called it “blatantly unlawful” and a threat to their ability to serve the public with educational content.Kerger said that PBS is reviewing all available options in response to the order, which she said jeopardizes the organization's five-decade mission to educate and inform Americans through public broadcasting. “We are currently exploring all options to allow PBS to continue to serve our member stations and all Americans,” she said in a statement.The executive order, signed late Thursday, directs the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) and other federal agencies to halt all funding to PBS and NPR, alleging “bias” in their coverage.The White House further claimed in a social media post that the two outlets “receive millions from taxpayers to spread radical, woke propaganda disguised as ‘news.’”However, CPB — a nonprofit organization that distributes federal funds to public media — responded by stating that it is not a federal executive agency and therefore is not subject to presidential directives. Earlier in the week, Trump announced the firing of three of CPB’s five board members and was immediately sued by CPB to stop it.The vast majority of public funds for PBS and NPR is directed to local stations, particularly those that rely heavily on government support to operate. Media advocates warn that the proposed cuts could cripple these stations, which often serve rural and underserved communities.While Republican efforts to cut public broadcasting funding are not new, this latest move is viewed by many in the industry as the most serious threat in PBS and NPR’s history. Observers see it as part of a broader campaign by Trump’s administration to dismantle such institutions which he perceives as ideologically opposed.Since starting his second term in January, President Trump has made big funding cuts to areas like the arts, education, and culture. He has also tried to change well-known institutions such as the John F Kennedy Center and the National Endowment for the Humanities. In addition, he wants to give federal money to universities and law firms only if they remove diversity programs and other efforts he doesn’t support.Two weeks ago, the White House said it plans to ask Congress to cancel funding for the CPB as part of a $9.1 billion budget cut. However, the official request hasn’t been sent to Capitol Hill yet.The move against PBS and NPR comes alongside Trump’s ongoing effort to dismantle the US Agency for Global Media — which oversees Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. The agency was designed to model independent news gathering globally in societies that restrict the press. Federal courts have already intervened in several cases, finding that the administration may have overstepped its authority in holding back funds appropriated to the outlets by Congress.","President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday.

Hegseth keeps 2 aircraft carriers in Middle East for another week for battle with Yemen's Houthis,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hegseth-keeps-2-aircraft-carriers-in-middle-east-for-another-week-for-battle-with-yemens-houthis/articleshow/120831167.cms,"Hegseth keeps 2 aircraft carriers in Middle East for another week for battle with Yemen's Houthis (Credits: AP)

Defense secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered the USS Harry S Truman aircraft carrier to remain in the Middle East for a second time, keeping it there another week so the US can maintain two carrier strike groups in the region to battle Yemen-based Houthi rebels, according to a US official.In late March, Hegseth extended the deployment of the Truman and the warships in its group for a month as part of a campaign to increase strikes on the Iran-backed Houthis. The official said Hegseth signed the latest order Thursday and it is expected the Truman and its strike group warships will head home to Norfolk, Virginia, after the week is up.Gen. Erik Kurilla, head of US Central Command, requested that the Truman be extended again, according to officials. The San Diego-based USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier and its strike group arrived in the region a few weeks ago and are operating in the Gulf of Aden. The Truman, along with two destroyers and a cruiser in its strike group, is in the Red Sea.The officials spoke Friday on the condition of anonymity to discuss military operations.The US has increased its attacks on the Houthis, launching daily strikes since March 15, when President Donald Trump ordered a new, expanded campaign. He promised to use ""overwhelming lethal force"" until the Houthis stop their attacks on shipping in the Red Sea, a vital trade corridor.According to Central Command, the US has been waging an ""intense and sustained campaign"" against the Houthis. In a statement over the weekend, the command said the US has struck more than 1,000 targets in Yemen since Operation Rough Rider began. It hasn't provided details on the targets or how the data is compiled.It has been rare in recent years for the US to have two aircraft carriers in the Middle East at the same time. Navy leaders have generally been opposed to the idea because it disrupts ship maintenance schedules and delays time at home for sailors strained by the unusually high combat tempo.If there are no additional extensions and the Truman and its warships leave the region next week, those sailors could be back home by next month.Last year, the Biden administration ordered the USS Dwight D Eisenhower aircraft carrier to remain in the Red Sea for an extended time as US warships waged the most intense running sea battle since World War II. Prior to that, it had been years since the US had committed that much warship power to the Middle East.The Houthis had been waging persistent missile and drone attacks against commercial and military ships in the region in what the group's leadership has described as an effort to end Israel's war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.From November 2023 until this January, the Houthis targeted more than 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two of them and killing four sailors. That has greatly reduced the flow of trade through the Red Sea corridor, which typically sees $1 trillion of goods move through it annually.The group paused attacks in a self-imposed ceasefire until the US launched a broad assault against the rebels in mid-March.In another action, Hegseth on Friday ordered the defense department to produce a new national defense strategy and gave leaders until the end of August to have a final draft. The strategy is the main blueprint that lays out the department's priorities as it moves to confront national security threats around the world.It will be Hegseth's opportunity to highlight what he wants the US military to focus on for the next several years and how the Pentagon will shift toward Trump's ""America First"" doctrine.The draft also will have to reflect the impact of Hegseth's sweeping personnel cuts and decisions to merge a number of military commands.","Defense secretary Pete Hegseth ordered the USS Harry S Truman aircraft carrier to remain in the Middle East for a second time.

Columbia University seems to have become the new target for the Trump administration , which has accused it of anti-Semitism on college campuses .

They don’t want peace, they want the land.""Another user said, ""The more these people speak, the clearer it becomes—they don’t support Palestinians, they support terrorists.""Meanwhile, a senior Trump-appointed justice department official has initiated a controversial investigation into Columbia University student protesters, causing significant concern among career prosecutors who considered the probe politically driven and legally questionable, according to New York Times.The investigation, targeting students protesting Israel's actions in Gaza, faced resistance from a federal magistrate judge who considered Emil Bove III's requested measures potentially unconstitutional and unwarranted, sources revealed.This previously undisclosed broad-scale investigation by the civil rights division exemplifies the internal tensions within the department. The administration's efforts to shift the division's focus from protecting minority rights to addressing alleged antisemitism on university campuses and controlling student protests has created significant discord.Recent weeks have witnessed numerous lawyers departing the division, largely due to such directives from political appointees, according to current and former officials.While the Columbia investigation appears currently inactive, it represents a significant point of contention within the Justice Department during Trump's second term, creating lasting friction among the department, courts and FBI, sources indicated.Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, responded, ""This is a false story fabricated by a group of people who allowed antisemitism and support of Hamas terrorists to fester for several years, standing by but doing nothing.""The administration's commitment to addressing campus protests against Israel's Gaza operations has targeted both university administrators and student activists, with some facing immigration detention. Activists contend that authorities are incorrectly equating policy criticism with antisemitism.The investigation commenced after February 26 events at Barnard College, where masked protesters entered Milbank Hall to oppose student expulsions. The incident, captured on video, resulted in minor injuries to a security guard.Bove directed an immediate investigation, particularly focusing on Columbia University Apartheid Divest, according to three anonymous sources familiar with the private details.Career prosecutors resisted Bove's instructions to obtain the group's membership list, questioning its existence and expressing concerns about First Amendment violations, these sources revealed.Samantha Trepel, who previously secured Derek Chauvin's federal conviction in the George Floyd case, was among the Justice Department lawyers assigned to this investigation, according to these individuals.","Former Columbia professor Ahmed Eldin said he would not call on Hamas to release the hostages.

"Donald Trump’s 2026 budget pushes spending cuts, expands national security focus",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trumps-2026-budget-pushes-spending-cuts-expands-national-security-focus/articleshow/120828774.cms,"Office of Management and Budget Director Russel Vought at White House (AP)

US President Donald Trump’s 2026 budget proposal outlines sweeping cuts to non-defence domestic spending, totalling $163 billion, while ramping up expenditures on national security, the White House announced Friday.The proposal targets diversity initiatives and climate change programs, reflecting the administration's political priorities. However, it notably omits detailed projections for income taxes, tariffs, or the federal deficit — a sign of the significant political and financial challenges Trump faces as he pledges tax cuts and debt repayment without harming economic growth, according to news agency AP.While presidential budgets are not binding, they serve as key indicators of an administration’s goals for the upcoming fiscal year. This marks Trump’s first budget since returning to the White House and underscores his second-term agenda alongside Republican efforts in Congress.Trump’s proposal comes amid a volatile economic environment triggered in part by his own tariff policies . The White House has imposed what could amount to hundreds of billions of dollars in tax increases through tariffs, raising concerns among consumers, CEOs, and global leaders about the risk of an economic downturn.The top-line figures released by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), now led by Russell Vought — a key figure in Project 2025 — reflect a ""skinny"" version of the budget, with more specifics promised in the coming weeks. “Details soon,” Vought told a Cabinet meeting earlier this week.With the federal budget surpassing $7 trillion, deficits nearing $2 trillion annually, and interest payments on the national debt approaching $1 trillion, the US debt has ballooned to $36 trillion. Much of this stems from pandemic-related spending, tax code changes, and increasing costs tied to aging-related healthcare programs like Medicare and Medicaid.The 2026 proposal reflects prior cost-cutting actions by Trump and the Department of Government Efficiency, now overseen by adviser Elon Musk, including a trimmed-down federal workforce. It may also preview new revenue sources, particularly from tariffs.Democrats are expected to fiercely oppose the plan, calling it a blueprint for slashing vital public programs. At the same time, congressional Republicans are working to draft Trump’s ""big, beautiful bill"" — a comprehensive legislative package combining tax cuts, spending reductions, and increased funding for mass deportations.House Speaker Mike Johnson, who has met with Trump multiple times this week, aims to pass the bill through the House by Memorial Day and forward it to the Senate. “We had a very productive and encouraging meeting at the White House this morning, and the remaining pieces of ‘The One, Big Beautiful Bill!’ are coming together very well,"" Johnson, R-La., said in a statement following Thursday’s meeting with Trump and key committee leaders.Still, divisions persist within the Republican ranks as they try to pass the bill over Democratic opposition. “We are awaiting some final calculations on a few of the tax components, and we expect to be able to complete that work on a very aggressive schedule,” Johnson added.Cabinet officials are now preparing to testify before Congress on their respective budget requests, with Vought expected to appear in the coming weeks to defend the administration’s plan.A veteran of conservative fiscal policy, Vought previously served in the same role during Trump’s first term and authored a chapter in Project 2025 detailing a federal government overhaul. He is also preparing a $9 billion rescission package aimed at cutting current 2025 funding for the US Agency for International Development and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which includes PBS and NPR.On Thursday, Trump signed an executive order instructing federal agencies and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to halt funding for PBS and NPR — a move that aligns with the rescission package and signals more cuts could follow","US President Donald Trump’s 2026 budget proposal outlines sweeping cuts to non- defence domestic spending, totalling $163 billion. The proposal targets diversity initiatives and climate change programs, reflecting the administration's political priorities. It notably omits detailed projections for income taxes, tariffs, or the federal deficit — a sign of the significant political and financial challenges Trump faces.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120828752,imgsize-1005892,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

Pakistan on Friday announced that it would continue to keep the Wagah border crossing open for its citizens stranded in India, following New Delhi's decision to revoke visas in the wake of the Pahalgam terror attack.The Attari-Wagah border which connects Amritsar in India with Lahore in Pakistan, was shut on Thursday after remaining open until April 30.Reports said that around 70 Pakistani nationals were left stranded at the border on Thursday, after the deadline for their departure from India had passed a day earlier.Responding to media questions, a spokesperson for Pakistan’s ministry of foreign affairs confirmed the presence of stranded Pakistani nationals at the Attari border, including children.“We are aware of the media reports indicating that some Pakistani nationals are stranded at Attari. We are open to receiving our citizens in case the Indian authorities allow them to cross the border from their side,” the Pakistan MoFA spokesperson said.The spokesperson further said that the Wagah crossing would continue to remain open in the future for Pakistani nationals wishing to return.The foreign office of neighbouring Pakistan also criticised India’s decision to revoke visas, stating, “The Indian decision to revoke visas of Pakistani citizens is creating serious humanitarian challenges,” and pointed to disruptions in medical treatments and family separations.The Centre issued ‘Leave India’ notices after the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam, Kashmir, which killed 26 people—mostly tourists—and was linked to Pakistan-based terrorists.The exit deadlines varied by visa type: April 26 for Saarc visa holders, April 27 for 12 other categories including business, tourism, and student visas, and April 29 for medical visa holders. After these deadlines, no cross-border movement was permitted between the two countries.In a reciprocal move, Pakistan had also shut down the Wagah crossing, revoked Indian visas under the Saarc Visa Exemption Scheme (SVES), and ordered Indian military advisers at the high commission to leave.""All cross-border transit from India through this route shall be suspended, without exception.

NEW DELHI: The US stepped in to prevent any military conflict between India and Pakistan over the Pahalgam terrorist attack as it asked both countries to avoid any flare-up and work for peace. India has been weighing punitive measures against Pakistan for its cross-border adventurism, but secretary of state Marco Rubio “encouraged” India in a phone conversation with counterpart S Jaishankar to work with Pakistan to de-escalate tensions and maintain peace and security in South Asia.There was no readout of the talks from the Indian side but Jaishankar himself said in a laconic post on X after his talks with Rubio that the perpetrators, backers and planners of the terrorist attack must be brought to justice. Rubio had spoken to Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif before his talks with Jaishankar and urged Pakistani officials’ cooperation in investigating “this unconscionable attack”. The state department’s Hindi account on X said in a post on Thursday evening that under US President Donald Trump those who support terrorism will have to face consequences.“The Secretary expressed his sorrow for the lives lost in the horrific terrorist attack in Pahalgam and reaffirmed the United States’ commitment to cooperation with India against terrorism,’’ said the US readout.The state department readout of the Rubio conversations seemed carefully worded as it said in the case of Pakistan that while urging it to work with India for peace, Rubio asked Sharif to “re-establish direct communications” but avoided the same in the Rubio-Jaishankar readout. The secretary spoke to Sharif about the need to condemn the Pahalgam terror attack , something that Pakistan has not done except at the UN Security Council where it joined others as a non-permanent member to condemn the attack but not before working to dilute the statement with help from China.According to the state department, Rubio and Sharif reaffirmed their “continued commitment” to holding terrorists accountable for their heinous acts of violence. Rubio had last month too in a conversation with Pakistan foreign minister Ishaq Dar underscored the importance of continued cooperation on counterterrorism between the US and Pakistan, while thanking Pakistan for the arrest and transfer to the US of ISIS-K operative Mohammad Sharifullah. The 2 countries also plan to hold a counterterrorism dialogue in June this year.Rubio was said to be encouraging other foreign ministers too to work with India and Pakistan to defuse tensions and his conversation with Jaishankar followed statements by powerful Gulf States like Saudi Arabia and Qatar, which also have strong ties with both countries, asking them to exercise restraint.US President Donad Trump had strongly condemned the Pahalgam attack and expressed full support to India to bring to justice the perpetrators. However, he later also said he’s close to both India and Pakistan and that they’ll themselves “get it figured out one way or the other”.",The US stepped in to prevent any military conflict between India and Pakistan over the Pahalgam terrorist attack.

Pakistan allows 150 stranded Afghan trucks to cross Wagah border into India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-allows-150-stranded-afghan-trucks-to-cross-wagah-border-into-india/articleshow/120802901.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Amid escalating tensions with India, Pakistan on Thursday allowed 150 Afghan trucks , stranded due to a recent suspension of transit trade, to cross into India via the Afghan-Attari border.The trucks, carrying goods destined for Indian markets, were granted passage after the Afghan embassy in Islamabad made a formal request on April 28, urging Pakistan to release the vehicles stranded at various transit points.Pakistan’s foreign office said that only trucks that had entered Pakistan before April 25, 2025 were permitted to proceed, with a detailed list of the 150 vehicles forwarded to relevant authorities to ensure smooth cross-border movement.The move comes at a time of heightened strain between Pakistan and India following a militant attack on April 22 in Pahalgam, Kashmir, which killed 26 people, mostly Hindu tourists.India’s subsequent accusations of Pakistan’s involvement led to a series of retaliatory measures, including the suspension of all trade, including transit trade, on April 24, as decided at a National Security Committee meeting in Islamabad. The Wagah border, the only fully-fledged international crossing between the two nations, was closed to all cross-border transit, leaving Afghan trucks stranded.The stranded trucks, laden with goods such as dry fruits, liquorice, and other Afghan exports, are critical to Afghanistan’s economy, particularly during its peak harvest season. Afghan traders and truck drivers, many of whom faced days of uncertainty, have welcomed the move. “We were stuck with nowhere to go,” said Ghani Gul, an Afghan driver stranded in Pakistan. “This permission means we can deliver our goods and support our families.”While the immediate focus is on 150 trucks, the FO’s willingness to review additional cases suggests that further transit facilitation could be possible if Afghanistan provides the necessary details. For now, the successful passage of these trucks through the Wagah border serves as a small but significant reminder of the potential for cooperation, even in the most challenging of times.","Pakistan allows 150 Afghan trucks to cross into India via the Afghan-Attari border.

"Amid drumbeats of war, Pakistan appoints ISI chief Asim Malik as NSA",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/amid-drumbeats-of-war-pakistan-appoints-isi-chief-asim-malik-as-nsa/articleshow/120802745.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistani spy agency ISI’s director general, Lt Gen Muhammad Asim Malik, was appointed Thursday as the country’s national security adviser (NSA), reinforcing the military’s primacy in security and political strategy amid the heightened possibility of war with India. Even in a country where the military has always loomed over governance, this is the first time that the ISI head will also officiate as NSA.The appointment, effective immediately, comes less than 10 days after the April 22 terrorist attack on tourists in J&K’s Pahalgam that put Pakistan in India’s crosshairs and triggered a diplomatic firestorm.Lt Gen Malik, who took over as ISI chief in Sept 2024, will advise PM Shehbaz Sharif on national security and foreign policy while steering Pakistan’s intelligence apparatus. The dual role, announced via a cabinet division notification, is widely seen as a power grab by the military, sidelining the civilian leadership at a time of reckoning.Pakistan’s denial of involvement in the Pahalgam attack – 26 people were killed – and calls for a “neutral” probe have done little to placate India.While Malik’s elevation amplifies ISI’s influence in shaping Pakistan’s response, both militarily and politically, critics argue this move exposes the fragility of Pakistan’s civilian governance.“Appointing the ISI chief as NSA hands the military a blank check to dictate terms, not just on security but in backchannel talks with India,” said a former diplomat.Malik’s track record as adjutant general, where he oversaw the crackdown on ex-PM Imran Khan’s supporters during the 2023 riots, suggests a hardline approach. His closeness to Army chief Gen Asim Munir, who handpicked him for the ISI role, has fuelled concerns of a military-driven agenda.Posts on X reflect public unease, with some calling it a step toward a “soft coup”, while others see it as a pragmatic response to India’s stand.The consolidation of power in Malik’s hands risks alienating civilian stakeholders and complicating diplomacy, especially after PM Narendra Modi vowed “complete operational freedom” for India’s armed forces.With the NSA post vacant since April 2022, Malik’s appointment fills a strategic void but raises questions about whether Pakistan’s military is preparing for war, negotiation, or both.","Lt Gen Muhammad Asim Malik appointed as the country’s national security adviser.

KECH: Two young Baloch students have allegedly been forcibly taken by Pakistsecurity forces in Turbat, the primary city of the Kech district in Balochistan, as reported by The Balochistan Post (TBP).Seventeen-year-old Shey Haq Baloch, the son of the deceased Altaf Baloch, and sixteen-year-old Adam Baloch, son of Saleem, were purportedly apprehended by security personnel on Tuesday shortly after arriving in Turbat from Karachi, according to TBP.Nugra Baloch, Shey Haq's sister, verified the occurrence in a Facebook post. She stated that both boys were first-year college students and were detained by Pakistani forces and intelligence agencies, as highlighted by the TBP report.""I call upon everyone to speak out against this unlawful and cruel act,"" she wrote. ""Assist us in our struggle for the safe return of my brother and Adam Baloch."" Shey Haq Baloch's father, Altaf Baloch, was killed in 2008 when Pakistani forces reportedly opened fire on a peaceful rally held by the Baloch National Front (BNF) in Turbat, according to the TBP report.In another instance on April 30, two young men, Amir, son of Dad Bakhsh, and Usman, son of Abdul Ghani, were reportedly kidnapped from a barber shop in Pasni, in Gwadar district. Both are locals of the town. A further case has been reported from Turbat's D-Baloch area, where Abdul Majeed, son of Abdul Ghani, was allegedly taken by unidentified armed individuals while he was waiting for transport with his children, as highlighted by the TBP report.Enforced disappearances in Balochistan continue to pose a serious and persistent issue. Human rights organisations have long accused Pakistani security agencies of systematically targeting students, activists, and ordinary civilians, according to the TBP report.Earlier on Tuesday, United Nations human rights experts described the ""relentless use of enforced disappearances"" in Balochistan as ""a severe human rights violation and an international crime"" and urged Pakistan to establish ""independent and effective mechanisms for searching and investigating,"" as per the TBP report.","Two young Baloch students have allegedly been forcibly taken by Pakistani security forces.

Thai prosecutors dropped royal defamation charges on Thursday against an American scholar accused of insulting the monarchy over an article published on a political website.Paul Chambers a longtime Southeast Asia politics scholar in Thailand, was arrested last month in Phitsanulok province, north of Bangkok, under the kingdom's strict lese-majeste laws .The case marked a rare instance of a foreign national being charged under Thailand's lese-majeste law, which bans criticism of King Maha Vajiralongkorn and his close family and carries sentences of up to 15 years in jail per offence.The Office of the Attorney-General said on Thursday it had decided ""not to indict"" Chambers.""The director-general had decided not to indict the suspect,"" the statement said, adding that prosecutors would seek to dismiss the case in court and coordinate with police.The Thai army, a staunch defender of the monarchy, filed the complaint over a short blurb posted on a political think tank website this year.A military spokesperson last week defended the decision to file the case following criticism that the army had no legal standing to do so under the Thai law.Trade talks between Thailand and the United States have been indefinitely postponed, fuelling speculation that the arrest may have strained diplomatic ties between the two countries.International watchdogs have expressed concern over the use of the lese-majeste laws, known as Article 112 against academics, activists and even students.One man in northern Thailand was jailed for at least 50 years for lese-majeste last year, while a woman was given a 43-year prison sentence in 2021.In 2023, a man was jailed for two years for selling satirical calendars featuring rubber ducks that a court said defamed the king.","Paul Chambers a longtime Southeast Asia politics scholar in Thailand.

A Bangladesh court on Wednesday granted bail to former Iskcon leader Chinmoy Krishna Das in a sedition case , reported Bangladesh's The Daily Star.Das was arrested following a controversy that erupted when a sedition case was filed against him and 18 others in Chittagong on October 30 last year.The charges were linked to the hoisting of a saffron flag above Bangladesh's official flag during the October 25 rally at Laldighi Maidan in Chattogram.Das was presented before a Chittagong court on Tuesday, where his bail plea was denied, and he was sent into custody. The arrest has triggered widespread outrage, with many demanding his immediate release.Das serves as the spokesperson for the Bangladesh Sammilita Sanatani Jagran Jote , a group that champions the rights and security of minorities. He has been a vocal advocate for the Hindu (Sanatani) community in Bangladesh, calling for key reforms such as a minority protection law, a tribunal for fast-tracking cases of minority persecution, and the establishment of a dedicated ministry of minority affairs.He gained widespread attention for organising large public rallies, including one in Chittagong on October 25 and another in Rangpur on November 22, which sparked significant socio-political discussions across the country.Das hails from Satkania Upazila in Chittagong. From 2016 to 2022, he was the Chittagong divisional secretary of Iskcon.

DHAKA: The central bank of Bangladesh has apparently incurred a huge financial loss due to the interim govt’s decision not to issue previously printed notes, with approximately Taka 15,000 crore worth of paper notes featuring the image of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman remaining unused. The decision aligns with govt’s efforts to diminish Bangabandhu’s presence in public memory.Although bank officials are unwilling to discuss the matter publicly, many, on conditions of anonymity, said the longstanding tradition of obtaining new notes from Bangladesh Bank has been abruptly halted, creating a crisis in the market. On the one hand, the printed money is being wasted without use; on the other hand, customers are suffering as a result, they added.“Notes of various denominations are printed using paper and ink purchased with people’s taxes. Millions of notes with Bangabandhu’s picture are still lying in the vaults of various banks. The Security Printing Corporation does not have the capacity to cancel all the notes at once and print new ones. Therefore, notes with Bangabandhu’s picture cann’t be suddenly cancelled,” Ziauddin Ahmed, former executive director of Bangladesh Bank and former managing director of Security Printing Corporation, told reporters.In this situation, he suggested the printed notes be circulated in the market to alleviate public suffering. “When new design notes come into the market, the old ones should be gradually withdrawn. Generally, notes printed once can be used for a maximum of four to five years,” Ahmed said.According to media reports, Bangladesh Bank is unable to issue new notes to banks in line with demand. The crisis became evident following the country’s political upheaval in Aug last year.Since all forms of currency, including metal coins, feature Mujibur’s image, Bangladesh Bank abruptly stopped issuing new notes early April. As a result, the notes featuring Bangabandhu’s image are not reaching the market. Shops, banks, and citizens are now left with torn and old, dirty notes.According to sources at Bangladesh Bank, the Security Printing Corporation is set to begin printing new design notes next month. In the first phase, new design notes of 20, 50, and 1,000 taka will be printed and subsequently released in the market through banks.","Taka 15,000 crore worth of paper notes featuring the image of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman remain unused.

Astrologer in Myanmar with 300k followers who predicted earthquake ‘in 12 days’ after deadly tremor arrested,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/astrologer-in-myanmar-with-300k-followers-who-predicted-earthquake-in-12-days-after-deadly-tremor-arrested/articleshow/120581055.cms,"A popular TikTok astrologer has been arrested in Myanmar after his viral prediction of another major earthquake stirred panic in a country still reeling from last month’s deadly tremor.John Moe The, 21, told his 300,000+ followers on April 9 that a “very strong” earthquake would strike “every city in Myanmar” within 12 days. “People should not stay in tall buildings,” read the warning, viewed 3.3 million times. “Take important things with you and run away from buildings during the shaking.”His prediction came just weeks after a real quake killed over 3,700 people and displaced 60,000, many of whom remain in tent encampments too afraid to return home. Authorities said the video caused renewed public fear.He was arrested Tuesday in a raid on his home in Monywa city, central Myanmar. The military government said in a statement: “We got a tip-off about fake news… Action will be taken effectively against him… and against those who spread or share fake news.”Though earthquake early warning systems exist, scientists including the USGS insist that predicting quakes in advance remains impossible. John Moe The’s account, titled ""John (Palmistry)"", also included cosmic predictions about political upheavals and foreign military strikes.Some, like Yangon resident Nan Nan, dismissed the video—but said others took it seriously. “Most of my neighbours dared not stay in their apartments,” she told AFP. “My friend even hired a small house outside Yangon in preparation.”As aftershocks continue and mistrust deepens, the arrest has sparked questions over the line between public caution and panic—and whether astrology should come with a warning label.","John Moe The, 21, told his 300,000+ followers on April 9 that a “very strong” earthquake would strike “every city in Myanmar” within 12 days.

COLOMBO: Sri Lanka's catholic church says the Vatican has named 167 of its faithful killed in Islamic State-inspired suicide bombings six years ago as witnesses of faith.Hundreds, including Christian, Buddhist, Hindu and Islamic religious figures, attended a vigil Monday in memory of the victims at the church of St. Anthony, targeted in the attacks.Archbishop of Colombo, Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, told the attendees Cardinal Marcello Semeraro, prefect of the Dicastery for the Causes of Saints in the Vatican, has included the names of 167 catholics who died in the bombings in the churches of St. Anthony in Colombo and St. Sebastian in Negombo ""in the catalogue of the witnesses of the faith in its order book, considering the context of their heroism.""He said they were chosen ""due to violent opposition to their faith motivated by 'odium fidei,' the hate of the faith."" Ranjith also said seven victims of other faiths were ""respectfully remembered.""Witnesses of faith are those who sacrificed their lives for their belief. Pope Francis formalized in 2023 a new category of recognition by the church of people who lost their lives while professing the catholic faith and created a special Vatican commission to catalogue their cases. The commission, based in the Vatican's saint-making office, has gathered hundreds of cases, with a view to highlighting them alongside officially recognized martyrs of the church, who are on the path to possible beatification or sainthood.More than 260 people, including 42 foreigners, were killed in the near-simultaneous bombings during Easter Sunday at three tourist hotels and three churches, two Catholic and one Protestant, on April 21, 2019.The catholic church in Sri Lanka has demanded further probing in the attacks, particularly after British television Channel 4 interviewed a man who said that he arranged a meeting between a local IS-inspired group, National Thowheed Jamath, and a top state intelligence official to hatch a plot to create insecurity in Sri Lanka and enable former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to win the presidential election later that year.","Sri Lanka's catholic church says the Vatican has named 167 of its faithful killed in Islamic State-inspired suicide bombings six years ago as witnesses of faith.

Millions of online fans

LONDON: British comedian and actor Russell Brand arrived at court in central London on Friday to face five charges of rape and other sexual offences.Brand, 49, who became known internationally as the husband of pop star Katy Perry after forging a career in Britain with his risque comedy routines, was charged last month.The celebrity, dressed casually in a dark coloured open-necked shirt and gold-framed sunglasses, did not speak as he made his way through a crush of media and onlookers outside Westminster Magistrates' Court for his first court hearing.Brand, who is believed to now live in the United States, faces two counts of rape, two of sexual assault and one of indecent assault.In a video response on X after he was charged last month, Brand denied all the alleged offences and said he was ""grateful"" for the ""opportunity"" to defend himself.""I was a fool before I lived in the light of the Lord. I was a drug addict, a sex addict and an imbecile, but what I never was was a rapist. I've never engaged in non-consensual activity,"" he said in the video.The charges relate to offences alleged to have taken place between 1999 and 2005 involving four women.Prosecutors charged him after a police investigation into allegations following a broadcast of a Channel 4 documentary in September 2023.London's Metropolitan Police have said the investigation remains open and urged ""anyone who has been affected by this case, or anyone who has any information"" to contact officers.Brand is charged with the rape of a woman in 1999 in the Bournemouth area on England's south coast, as well as the oral rape and sexual assault of a woman in 2004 in the Westminster area of central London.He has also been charged with indecently assaulting a woman in 2001 and sexually assaulting another woman between 2004 and 2005 -- both incidents alleged to have taken place in Westminster.Born in 1975 to working-class parents in Essex, east of London, Brand began his stand-up career as a teenager.He burst onto the scene as a provocative, often lewd comedian before transforming into a Hollywood star, then an anti-establishment guru and conspiracy theorist who has millions of fans online.He has almost seven million subscribers on YouTube, 11.3 million on X and 4.8 million on Instagram.He presented a show on the BBC's Radio 2 station between 2006 and 2008, but left after an on-air prank when he left a sexually explicit voicemail for ""Fawlty Towers"" actor Andrew Sachs about his granddaughter.He also presented a ""Big Brother"" spin-off show for several years and wrote columns for the left-wing Guardian newspaper and penned two autobiographies.Brand was married to US star Perry for 14 months between 2010 and 2012.He is now married to the author and illustrator Laura Gallacher, with whom he has three children.","British comedian and actor Russell Brand arrives at court in central London.

Poll Do you believe that Kneecap's comments warrant a counterterrorism investigation? No Yes

LONDON: British police said Thursday that counterterrorism detectives will investigate comments by Irish hip-hop group Kneecap, which has been criticized by UK politicians over statements about the Middle East and British politics.The Irish-language rappers from Northern Ireland were reported to police over footage from a 2024 concert in which a band member appeared to say: ""The only good Tory is a dead Tory. Kill your local MP."" Footage from another concert, in 2023, appears to show a member of the trio shouting ""up Hamas, up Hezbollah"" - both banned organizations in the UK.London's Metropolitan Police force said the videos were referred to the Counter Terrorism internet Referral Unit for assessment by specialist officers, who have determined there are grounds for further investigation into potential offenses linked to both videos.""The investigation is now being carried out by officers from the Met's Counter Terrorism Command and inquiries remain ongoing at this time,"" the force said in a statement.The Belfast trio is known for satirical lyrics and use of symbolism associated with the Irish republican movement, which seeks to unite Northern Ireland, currently part of the UK, with the Republic of Ireland. More than 3,600 people were killed during three decades of violence in Northern Ireland involving Irish republican militants, pro-British Loyalist militias and the UK security forces.Kneecap's comments were criticized in the House of Commons this week by government and opposition lawmakers, who noted that two members of Parliament have been murdered since 2016.In a statement on Instagram , band members Liam Og O Hannaidh, Naoise O Caireallain and JJ O Dochartaigh apologized to the families of Labour Party lawmaker Jo Cox, who was killed in by a far-right attacker in 2016, and Conservative legislator David Amess, murdered in 2021 by an Islamic State supporter.The group said ""we never intended to cause you hurt."" Kneecap said it had ""never supported Hamas or Hezbollah,"" and accused ""establishment figures"" of taking comments out of context to ""manufacture moral hysteria"" because of the band's criticism of Israel's attacks on Palestinians in Gaza.Several Kneecap gigs have been cancelled as a result of the controversy, and some British lawmakers have called on organizers of June's Glastonbury Festival to scrap a planned performance by the group.Fellow musicians have come to the rappers' defense. Several dozen performers, including British rock group Primal Scream, Irish band Fontaines DC and mod singer Paul Weller have signed an open letter criticizing a ""clear, concerted attempt to censor and ultimately deplatform"" Kneecap and opposing ""political repression of artistic freedom.""","Irish hip-hop group Kneecap will be investigated by UK police over their controversial remarks.

Temperature in Britain could set records this week,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/temperature-in-britain-could-set-records-this-week/articleshow/120778706.cms,"Britons have basked in a burst of summerlike weather this week as temperatures have surged beyond the seasonal average - and they may soon break records. Forecasters say Thursday may be Britain's warmest May 1, with highs expected to reach 84.2F (29C).The heat has been driven by two key factors: a large area of high pressure that has settled over Britain, causing descending air that warms as it sinks, and continuous sunshine, fuelling daytime heating.Aidan McGivern, a meteorologist at the Met Office, explained that this has been a familiar pattern over the last few months. ""The sun this time of the year is as strong as it is in Aug,"" he said. ""We're not importing this air from anywhere else - this is homegrown warmth."" London recorded Britain's highest temperature of the year on Monday, only for that to be beaten on Tuesday.The mercury is expected to rise further on Wednesday and Thursday. Overnight temperatures have been above average too, with parts of Scotland experiencing their warmest April night on record.The peak of the heat is expected on Thursday. Temperatures in southern England could reach 29C, which would be a record for May 1. The current record was set in 1990 in Lossiemouth, Scotland, which hit 27.4C. If temperatures rise a bit higher, it could also become the earliest date in the year that Britain has hit 30C, based on Met Office data going back to 1860. Typical highs for Britain in late April are around 54F (12) in northern areas and 61F (16)in the south. nyt","Temperatures in southern England could reach 29C, which would be a record for May 1.

UK govt says ‘India has full support to go after perpetrators’ of Pahalgam terror attack,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-govt-says-india-has-full-support-to-go-after-perpetrators-of-pahalgam-terror-attack/articleshow/120742075.cms,"TOI correspondent from London

: The UK govt has said “India has our full support to go after the perpetrators of that attack (Pahalgam terror attack)” and that it is “seeking to play its full diplomatic role to help manage heightened tensions between India and Pakistan” as the tensions spill over onto the streets of Britain.But, foreign office minister Hamish Falconer said in the House of Commons on Tuesday, “It is important there is a proper law-enforcement-led response based on a focus of the actual perpetrators.”Britain said it was “vital that here in the UK all of us in positions of influence at a community level do what we can to ensure those tensions do not play out on British streets. A terrible terrorist attack has been perpetrated … We encourage Pakistanis to cooperate fully with the Indian govt in their efforts to investigate,” Falconer said. He was speaking during a debate on the Pahalgam attack, which left 26 people dead, following an urgent question by Labour MP Gurinder Singh Josan.“The two states are talking to each other, which is welcome. It is understandable the concerns India has for its security in light of such a horrific incident and it is clearly taking steps to try to establish the facts of the incident as best it can and will have British support to do so,” Falconer said.Falconer refrained from commenting on what UK security agencies know as to who is behind the attacks. He said both the Pakistan and India high commissions “will receive all support from the UK state to ensure they remain safe.”A J&K-born man, Ankit Love (41), was charged with criminal damage after allegedly smashing windows at the Pakistan high commission on Sunday. He appeared in court on Monday. He was blacklisted by the Indian govt after being charged with criminal damage for throwing eggs and stones at the India high commission in Feb 2022.Falconer toldMPs he was aware of the throat-slitting gesture video of a Pakistan diplomat. “The Metropolitan police are investigating, so I will not provide any further commentary on that particular incident, but it is obviously concerning,” Falconer said.Several MPs expressed their horror at how Hindus and Christians were targeted in the attack. Others criticised India for suspending the Indus water treaty or making “unfounded claims” against Pakistan or resorting to ""bulldozer tactics"".Labour MP Barry Gardiner asked: “Is it not time to make the support we give to Pakistan conditional on them finally closing down the terrorist training camps that they harbour?”“Until the investigation is concluded, we should not speculate on the nature of the attack. As we understand it, international agreements have been put in abeyance, rather than being rescinded,” Falconer said.","India has our full support to go after the perpetrators of that attack (Pahalgam terror attack), UK govt says.

Google Maps Naming Conventions: 'Gulf of Mexico' to become 'Gulf of America' on Google Maps in the US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/gulf-of-mexico-to-become-gulf-of-america-on-google-maps-in-the-us/articleshow/117615975.cms,"'Gulf of Mexico' to become 'Gulf of America' on Google Maps in the US (Picture credit: AP, X/@Google)

Google Maps will soon display new naming conventions for two prominent US landmarks following President Donald Trump's executive orders.The Gulf of Mexico will be renamed the “Gulf of America,” and Alaska’s Denali will revert to its former name, Mount McKinley , according to updates from Google.The Trump administration officially renamed the Gulf of Mexico last week, directing federal agencies to adopt the term “Gulf of America” on all official documents and platforms. Google Maps confirmed the changes would take effect once the US Geographic Names Information System reflects the updates.“We have a longstanding practice of applying name changes when they have been updated in official government sources,” Google noted on social media platform X.However, the Gulf will still be labelled ""Gulf of Mexico"" for users in Mexico, while users outside both nations will see both names.Similarly, the Trump administration reinstated the name Mount McKinley for North America’s tallest peak, which was renamed Denali during President Barack Obama’s administration in 2015.The change was initially made to honour Alaska Native heritage, as “Denali” means ""the high one"" in the Koyukon Athabaskan language. Trump, however, cited the historical significance of honouring President William McKinley, stating that McKinley contributed to America's prosperity through tariffs and strong leadership.Google Maps will implement this change for also for US users, while international users will see both names, continuing its dual-labeling policy for disputed or dual-use geographic names, as per Reuters.Renaming disputes are not new for Google Maps. For example, bodies of water like the ""Sea of Japan (East Sea)"" and the ""Persian Gulf (Arabian Gulf)"" are labelled with dual names to respect varying international perspectives. This approach ensures users see culturally and politically sensitive names in their local contexts.Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum recently joked that North America could be renamed ""Mexican America"" in response to Trump’s order, referencing early historical maps of the region.","The Gulf of Mexico will be renamed the ‘Gulf of America’ on Google Maps.

Dozens of senior aid officials placed on leave amid investigation into alleged effort to thwart Donald Trump's orders,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/dozens-of-senior-aid-officials-placed-on-leave-amid-investigation-into-alleged-effort-to-thwart-donald-trumps-orders/articleshow/117616419.cms,"Fallout from Trump's executive orders

Focus on US interests

At least 56 senior officials from the US agency for international development (USAID) were placed on administrative leave Monday following an internal investigation into an alleged attempt to undermine US President Donald Trump’s recent executive orders. The move, confirmed by both current and former USAID officials, has raised questions about the agency's compliance with the President’s directives.According to a report from news agency AP, the USAID employees, many of whom have served under multiple administrations, were placed on leave after Jason Gray, the acting administrator, identified actions within the agency that appeared to circumvent Trump's executive orders. The freeze on most US foreign assistance, which was issued last week, has had a sweeping impact on aid organisations across the globe, with thousands of employees now facing layoffs as programs grind to a halt.""We have placed a number of USAID employees on administrative leave with full pay and benefits until further notice while we complete our analysis of these actions,"" Gray wrote in an internal USAID notice obtained by The Associated Press. The notice did not specify which executive orders the employees were suspected of violating.The decision to place the senior USAID officials on leave follows an executive order by President Trump, which directed a 90-day pause on most foreign assistance disbursed through the state department. As a result of the freeze, critical humanitarian, development, and security programs around the world have stopped or are preparing to cease operations.The USAID staff were working to address the impact of the freeze, attempting to secure waivers to continue providing life-saving services, including access to clean water in Sudan and monitoring global health threats like bird flu. However, many of these efforts have been halted, leaving aid organizations scrambling to find alternate funding sources.In addition to the freeze on foreign assistance, secretary of state Marco Rubio has exempted only emergency food programs and military aid to Israel and Egypt from the suspension. Trump and GOP lawmakers have voiced concerns about the effectiveness and necessity of foreign aid, with many calling for a thorough review of each program to determine whether it aligns with US interests and is worth funding.While the freeze has caused significant disruption in international aid efforts, the Trump administration and its allies argue that the pause will allow the US government to assess foreign assistance programs more critically and eliminate those that are perceived as wasteful or politically driven.The decision to place USAID officials on leave has sparked significant attention, with many questioning how this investigation might reshape US foreign aid priorities in the years to come.As of now, no timeline has been set for the completion of the investigation, and USAID has not yet indicated which individuals will ultimately return to their roles.","At least 56 senior officials from the US agency for international development (USAID) were placed on administrative leave Monday.

'Only-in-America'

WASHINGTON: Billionaire hedge fund manager Scott Bessent won Senate approval Monday to become US Treasury secretary , placing him at the forefront of implementing Donald Trump's economic agenda -- which is already triggering global jitters.Bessent, a Wall Street veteran who was born and raised in South Carolina, has defended the Republican president's tax cutting and tariff proposals while urging efforts to secure supply chains and the dollar's global status.On Monday, he cleared a confirmation vote with a comfortable margin of 68-29, with bipartisan support.As Treasury chief, Bessent will have a hand in the administration's tax policies and its budget, confronting the debt limit and steering plans that could lead to fresh tariffs.Mike Crapo, who chairs the Senate Finance Committee, said Monday that Bessent was ""committed to restoring the prosperity and opportunity"" seen under Trump's leadership.But Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the committee, warned it was unclear that Bessent would serve as a check on Trump's economic plans, which could weigh on consumers and small businesses.Bessent, 62, has said he would back tougher sanctions on Russian oil majors as a way to end the war in Ukraine, while signaling a hawkish approach on China.Trump returned to the White House this month vowing lower taxes to aid Americans squeezed by high costs of living, and tariffs to pressure other countries to align on US concerns.The president has warned of tariffs on allies and adversaries -- including major trading partners Mexico and Canada on February 1.Now all eyes are on how his Treasury chief walks the line between supporting these efforts and avoiding tensions that may roil the world economy.At his hearing, Bessent disagreed that Trump's proposed duties on imports would be paid for domestically, noting that levies can be used in negotiations, to remedy unfair trade practices or to boost revenues.He also took aim at government spending and high budget deficits.He will have to grapple with Trump's promised tax cuts -- alongside their consequences for the US economy -- as he begins his role.The Treasury Department has oversight across areas from federal finances to bank supervision. It also oversees US sanctions.Bessent is the first Senate-confirmed openly gay cabinet official in a Republican administration.He has been based in Charleston, South Carolina, with his husband and their two children.Bessent has known the Trump family for three decades and was friends with the president's late brother Robert, he previously said.""I was all-in for President Trump,"" he said on Trump ally Roger Stone's radio show.Bessent attended Yale University and served as chief investment officer of Soros Fund Management, the macroeconomic investment firm of liberal billionaire George Soros.In 2015, he raised capital, including $2 billion from Soros, to start his own hedge fund.More recently, Bessent said he had not spoken to Soros in years.Bessent is chief executive at Key Square Group, but has committed to resigning from the position at the hedge fund and divesting his partnership share upon confirmation.During his confirmation hearing, Bessent recounted taking an internship in finance -- a job that came with an office pullout sofa, allowing him to live in New York rent-free.""I've been involved in the financial markets ever since,"" he told lawmakers. ""My life has been the only-in-America story that I am determined to preserve for future generations.""Urging for all tools to be used ""to realign the economic system to better serve the interests of working Americans,"" Bessent has criticized ""unfair distortions"" in global trade.He previously floated the idea of Trump nominating a ""shadow Fed chair"" to dilute the influence of Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell.But he has since dropped the idea and stated that he supports the central bank's independence in policymaking.""President Trump is going to make his views known, as many senators did,"" Bessent said in his hearing on January 16.He added that on monetary policy, the Fed's rate-setting committee ""should be independent.""","Billionaire hedge fund manager Scott Bessent wins Senate approval to become US Treasury secretary.

Now, AP is calling on the filmmakers to lift the non-disclosure agreements they placed on their subjects to allow the company to investigate more fully. ""AP stands ready to review any and all evidence and new information about this photo,"" Lauren Easton, an AP spokesperson, said Sunday.Nghe joined filmmakers for a post-screening Q&A where he said, ""I took the photo."" The audience cheered. He did not say why he waited so long to make the claim. Nguyen says he took the iconic photo of Kim Phuc on June 8, 1972. Nghe said he went to the town of Trang Bang that day as a driver for an NBC news crew and captured the image of Phuc running down the street, crying and naked with arms outstretched. He said he sold his image to AP for $20, and they gave him a print of the photo that his wife later destroyed.""I'm not a journalist by any stretch of the imagination,"" he said. ""I had a healthy scepticism going against a 53-year-old truth. But as a storyteller and filmmaker, I thought it was my responsibility and privilege to be able to uplift the story of individuals like Nghe.""A primary source in the film is Carl Robinson, then an AP photo editor in Saigon, who was overruled in his judgment not to use the picture by Horst Faas, AP's Saigon chief of photos. Robinson says in the film Faas instructed him to ""make it staff"" and credit Ut for the photo. Faas and Yuichi ""Jackson"" Ishizaki, who developed the film, are dead. Robinson, 81, was dismissed by AP in 1978.On Saturday, when asked why he wanted to come forward with the allegations now, Robinson told the Sundance audience, ""I didn't want to die before this story came out. I wanted to find (Nghe) and say sorry.""The film's probe took over two years. Journalists enlisted French forensics team INDEX to help determine the likelihood of whether Ut had been in a position to take the photo.

The Standoff: Trump’s Tariffs vs. Petro’s Pride



Golf Diplomacy at Its Peak



A Million TV Shows, But Nothing Like This



Lessons from the Green



In a world where political dramas like House of Cards thrive on intrigue and audacity, even the most incredulous storylines pale in comparison to the spectacle of Donald Trump's presidency. Hollywood scriptwriters might be dismissed outright for proposing a scenario where a sitting president resolves international conflicts mid-golf game while simultaneously live-tweeting. Yet, that’s precisely what Trump accomplished, making even Frank Underwood look timid.The recent face-off between President Trump and Colombian President Gustavo Petro encapsulates this unparalleled approach. What began as a defiant standoff by Petro ended halfway through one of Trump’s golf rounds, proving once again that Trump’s playbook—equal parts spectacle and strategy—continues to rewrite the rules of global diplomacy.It started with a bold move: Gustavo Petro, Colombia’s leftist president, refused to allow US military planes carrying deported Colombian migrants to land in his country. Petro framed his stance as a stand for dignity and sovereignty, invoking historical grievances and the resilience of his people in fiery social media posts. However, Trump, never one to shy away from confrontation, retaliated swiftly with a 25% tariff on Colombian goods, a threat to double it within a week, and visa sanctions targeting Colombian officials.Petro’s response was defiant, even poetic, as he drew on Colombia’s rich history and cultural identity . In a lengthy statement, he challenged Trump’s arrogance, criticized US interventionism, and vowed that Colombia would “stop looking northward” and instead “open itself to the world.”Yet, as dramatic as the rhetoric was, the economic reality began to bite. Trump, from the golf course, turned up the heat. By the time Petro’s defiance reached its crescendo, Trump had not only set the terms but also made it clear that the clock was ticking. The mounting economic pressure, coupled with Trump’s characteristic brazenness, left Petro with little choice.Petro’s resistance crumbled before Trump even finished half a game. It’s reported that Trump, between putts, dictated a series of tweets and press releases that not only outlined the consequences for Colombia but also turned the situation into a media spectacle. The pièce de résistance was Trump’s viral FAFO post—an a cronym for “F*** around, find out” —cementing his stance and adding a touch of meme-worthy bravado to the diplomatic row.In a few hourse, Petro announced a reversal of his position. The presidential plane of Colombia would be used to facilitate the “dignified return” of deported migrants. The tariffs and sanctions Trump had threatened were “held in reserve,” pending compliance with US demands.What sets this episode apart is not just Trump’s unapologetic style but the sheer efficiency with which he achieves results. While traditional diplomacy involves layers of negotiation, Trump’s approach resembles a high-stakes poker game played in full view of the public. The combination of economic leverage, social media theatrics, and an unwavering confidence in his own methods has redefined presidential diplomacy in ways that no political drama or Hollywood script could anticipate.For better or worse, Trump’s handling of the Petro standoff will be studied as a case study in power dynamics and modern leadership. It demonstrates the efficacy of combining economic might with media savvy, though it also underscores the vulnerability of nations dependent on US trade. As Trump sinks his putts and Petro reflects on the economic realities of his decisions, one thing becomes clear: in Trump’s world, the art of the deal isn’t confined to boardrooms or summits—it’s as likely to unfold on the back nine of a golf course. However, it should be mentioned that Trump has more challenging assignments on the cards. Bullying Colombia is chickenfeed compared to dealing with China or ending the Russia-Ukraine war. That wil be a true test of Trump's mettle.","President Donald Trump faced off against Colombian President Gustavo Petro.

In recent weeks, 7,826 samples have been tested as part of increased monitoring efforts.Amanda Pritchard, chief executive of NHS England , expressed concerns earlier this month about the growing strain on healthcare services already overwhelmed by winter illnesses. Posting on X, she said: “It is difficult to put into words just how tough it is for our frontline staff at the moment. We are really worried about the toll that flu and other viruses are taking on our patients and on services across the NHS.”She noted the growing strain on hospitals increased ambulance calls and admissions. To manage the crisis, steps like increasing bed capacity and providing home care were introduced. Pritchard also urged people to seek help early, saying: “We would rather see you sooner when viruses are easier to treat than later when it is more difficult.”The UKHSA has urged people, especially the elderly and vulnerable, to take precautions like wearing masks in crowded places, maintaining hygiene, and staying home if feeling unwell.With the rise of hMPV cases, officials are calling for public cooperation to help reduce pressure on the NHS during harsh winter.","Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) has caused major outbreaks in northern China.

Troops reinstatement and vaccine controversy



Transgender policies and DEI rollbacks



Border security and expanding defence



Vice President Vance Swears in Pete Hegseth to be Secretary of Defense

President Donald Trump on Monday announced a series of sweeping executive orders, signing a few already, that includes, reinstatement of service members discharged for refusing Covid-19 vaccinations and the elimination of DEI initiatives across federal agencies and the military. Additional orders are expected as well-known television personality Pete Hegseth begins his first day as the new Pentagon chief.Earlier, speaking at a Republican gathering, Trump pledged to reinstate service members discharged over Covid-19 vaccine refusals and dismantle diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEO) programs within the military.“We will build an Iron Dome for America — a system to protect our homeland from missile and drone threats,” Trump said. “This is a top priority for ensuring our national defence.”Defence secretary Pete Hegseth, on his first day in office, confirmed the plans, describing the initiative as a critical step in modernising United States missile defence capabilities.Trump’s has signed the reinstatement of service members discharged for refusing Covid-19 vaccinations. He assured they would return to their former ranks with full back pay. “We will offer full reinstatement to any service member who was expelled from the armed forces due to the Covid vaccine mandate,” he said.While the Pentagon formally ended the vaccine mandate in January 2023, the order could have financial implications if large numbers of discharged troops re-enlist. To date, fewer than 150 of the 8,200 discharged service members have sought to return, citing new careers or reluctance to re-join.Returning personnel would still need to meet military entry standards, including physical fitness, medical requirements, and background checks. Officers would also need to undergo a recommissioning process.Trump also directed the Pentagon to reassess policies on transgender troops, emphasising military readiness. The order does not immediately ban transgender service members but mandates the development of new guidelines.In addition, Trump doubled down on his campaign promise to eliminate DEI initiatives across federal agencies and the military. Hegseth emphasised a focus on readiness, saying, “Military training will prioritise what our troops in the field need to deter our enemies.”The removal of DEI programs has already caused confusion within the armed forces.Last week, videos honouring the historic contributions of the Tuskegee Airmen and Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASPs) were temporarily removed during a review of DEI training materials.The air force later clarified that these materials would remain part of its curriculum, highlighting their decorated service in World War II.Hegseth outlined additional priorities, including using active duty, national guard, and state-activated guard troops to address border security.He also reaffirmed Trump’s commitment to the Iron Dome project, which aims to provide the US with a domestic missile defense system akin to Israel’s.“We are moving quickly to ensure the safety and security of the American people,” Hegseth said, as he entered the Pentagon on Monday morning.Hegseth, confirmed in a tie-breaking Senate vote by vice president JD Vance, is expected to oversee the rapid rollout of these initiatives in the coming weeks.","Pete Hegseth begins his first day as the new Pentagon chief.

Nvidia loses nearly $600 bn

US vs China in AI

US President Donald Trump on Monday described the emergence of China’s low-cost AI model, DeepSeek, as a ""wake-up call"" for American industries, following a sharp selloff in US tech stocks. Speaking at a Republican congressional retreat in Miami, Trump said the launch of DeepSeek highlighted the need for the United States to refocus on competing in the rapidly evolving AI sector.""Hopefully, the release of DeepSeek AI from a Chinese company should be a wake-up call for our industries that we need to be laser-focused on competing to win,"" Trump said, emphasising the urgency for innovation.Despite the disruption, Trump suggested the shockwave created by DeepSeek could push Silicon Valley to innovate more efficiently. ""I would say that could be a positive,"" he noted. ""Instead of spending billions and billions, you'll spend less, and you'll come up with hopefully the same solution.""The president's remarks come after Nvidia, the US chipmaker that dominates the AI semiconductor market, lost nearly $600 billion in market value, leading a broader rout in tech stocks. Nvidia's fall highlights the growing pressure on American firms to compete with the cost-effective advancements coming from Chinese startups.DeepSeek, developed by a startup based in Hangzhou, has reportedly matched the performance of leading US AI models at a fraction of the investment. Its release underscores China's increasing competitiveness in artificial intelligence, a field historically dominated by the United States.Last week, following his second-term inauguration, Trump unveiled a $500 billion initiative to bolster AI infrastructure in the United States. The venture, led by Japanese tech giant SoftBank and OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, aims to strengthen America's position in the global AI race.The president's comments reflect growing concerns about the implications of China's advancements in AI technology. While the United States has long been the leader in AI development, DeepSeek's success has amplified fears about losing that edge.The debut of DeepSeek adds another layer to the intensifying competition between the US and China in technology, particularly in AI, where breakthroughs have the potential to reshape industries, economies, and even national security strategies.","US President Donald Trump described the emergence of China’s low-cost AI model, DeepSeek, as a ""wake-up call"" for American industries.

US President Donald Trump announced plans to construct a domestic version of Israel’s renowned ""Iron Dome"" missile defence system, as per remarks made at a Republican congressional retreat in Miami on Monday.The executive order will aim to build a state-of-the-art air defence shield designed to protect the United States from missile threats.“We need to immediately begin the construction of a state-of-the-art Iron Dome missile defence shield, which will be able to protect Americans,” Trump stated. He highlighted that the system, like Israel’s, will be produced domestically, saying, “It will be made right here in the USA.”The Israeli Iron Dome has gained worldwide acclaim for intercepting short-range rocket attacks, particularly during recent conflicts with Hamas and Hezbollah. Trump praised the system, saying it “knocks down just about every one of them” and emphasised the United States' entitlement to similar protection.While Trump’s announcement drew from Israel's success, experts have noted that the Iron Dome is specifically designed for short-range rocket threats and may not address the US' primary missile concerns, such as intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs).According to a CNN fact sheet, the executive order mandates a more advanced, layered missile defence shield capable of addressing threats from ballistic, hypersonic and advanced cruise missiles.The project envisions space-based systems to detect and neutralise attacks, though no detailed timeline or cost estimates were provided. Existing US defences, such as Patriot missile systems and shoulder-launched Stinger missiles, already offer a multi-layered response to some missile threats, but the proposed system would represent a significant technological leap.In addition to the Iron Dome initiative, Trump is likely to sign three other executive orders focused on military policies, including reinstating service members discharged for refusing Covid-19 vaccination, banning transgender individuals from military service, and ending Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) programs in the armed forces, reported CNN.","US President Donald Trump announced plans to construct a domestic version of Israel’s renowned ""Iron Dome"" missile defence system.

US President Donald Trump on Monday announced his intention to sign an executive order eliminating what he described as ""transgender ideology"" from the military, a move that could represent a significant rollback of LGBTQ rights in the armed forces.Speaking at a Republican congressional retreat in Miami, Trump declared the policy as one of ""four new executive orders"" he plans to enact related to the military.""To ensure that we have the most lethal fighting force in the world, we will get transgender ideology the hell out of our military,"" Trump said, reiterating his long-standing opposition to allowing transgender individuals to serve.This announcement reignites a contentious debate over the inclusion of transgender Americans in the armed forces, an issue that has seen dramatic policy shifts over the past decade. The ban on transgender service members was first lifted in 2016 during the then President Barack Obama's administration, allowing them to serve openly and paving the way for transgender recruits to join starting in 2017.However, Trump's first administration delayed the implementation of that policy before ultimately reversing it entirely, citing concerns about costs, disruptions, and military readiness. Critics of the reversal, including LGBTQ rights groups , argued that it was discriminatory and undermined the principle of equality in military service.In contrast, Joe Biden restored the Obama-era policy just days after taking office in 2021, asserting that all qualified Americans who wished to serve should be able to do so. This policy change allowed transgender troops to serve openly and provided protection against discrimination.Trump's renewed push to ban transgender individuals from the military aligns with broader efforts by some Republicans to restrict transgender rights across the country. States controlled by Republican lawmakers have enacted legislation limiting access to gender-affirming care, barring transgender athletes from competing in school sports, and regulating what books on the topic can appear in public and school libraries.The number of transgender service members in the US military is relatively small, with estimates suggesting around 15,000 out of more than two million uniformed personnel. Nonetheless, their removal could have a tangible impact on the military's capacity, particularly at a time when recruitment challenges are mounting.Lloyd Austin appeared to take aim at Trump's plans in a recent farewell address, warning of the potential consequences of excluding qualified Americans from military service. ""Any military that turns away qualified patriots who are eager to serve is just making itself smaller and weaker,"" Austin said.","US President Donald Trump announced his intention to sign an executive order eliminating what he described as ""transgender ideology"" from the military.

In a sweeping move that underscores the US President Donald Trump administration 's efforts to reshape federal law enforcement , acting attorney general James McHenry on Monday fired more than a dozen prosecutors who had worked on the two criminal investigations into Trump for special counsel Jack Smith . According to a justice department spokesperson, the decision was based on concerns that the prosecutors could not be trusted to ""faithfully implement"" the president's agenda.""Acting attorney general James McHenry made this decision because he did not believe these officials could be trusted to faithfully implement the president's agenda because of their significant role in prosecuting the president,"" a justice department official said.While the department declined to name the prosecutors involved, sources familiar with the situation revealed that many of the dismissals targeted career lawyers who were protected under civil service laws. A person who had worked alongside members of Smith's team described the firings as likely violating these protections, raising questions about the legality of the administration's actions.The firings, though abrupt, were not entirely unexpected. Trump had long vowed to remove Smith and his team, citing personal grievances over their investigations into his actions. While Smith and several of his top prosecutors resigned before Trump's inauguration, others had returned to their original posts, including roles within the US attorney's office in Washington.The move is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to tighten control over the justice department and centralise decision-making within the White House. Last week, Trump's team initiated a series of personnel changes that saw the reassignment of Bradley Weinsheimer, the associate deputy attorney general and one of the department's most senior career officials, to a less influential position.Weinsheimer, a respected figure in the justice department with extensive experience in managing sensitive cases, is just one of several seasoned officials affected by the administration’s overhaul. Key supervisors with expertise in national security, international investigations, extraditions, and public corruption have also been reassigned, with some choosing to resign in protest. On Monday, the chief of the public integrity section announced his resignation, further signalling discontent within the department.The firings come as Trump doubles down on his promise to dismantle and reconstruct the justice department, a pledge he has repeatedly made in public statements. Legal experts warn that the administration's actions could undermine the department's independence and erode public confidence in the impartiality of federal law enforcement.It remains unclear who will replace the ousted prosecutors and officials, but the move has already sparked intense scrutiny and debate over the future of the justice department under Trump’s leadership.",The move is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to tighten control over the justice department.

I don’t understand. I’m so sorry. I wish I could do something but I can’t.” Gomez's family is from Mexico. ""I'm sorry,"" she wrote with an emoji of the Mexican flag on her video which is now deleted.""Apparently it's not ok to show empathy for people,"" Gomez wrote in a follow-up post but both posts were deleted.Television personality Dr Phil (Phil McGraw) tagged along with the ICE on their deportation drive as Homan also joined the drive Sunday. “It’s a pretty high-risk mission that we’re going on,” Dr. Phil said in one video, claiming that the operation was aimed at capturing over 200 “high-value targets,” or people with criminal histories.","Tom Homan said the administration owes no apology to celebrities like Selena Gomez who are not in favor of mass deportation.

He sentenced the four men to death and also fined them 4.6 million Pakistani rupees (approximately $16,000). They were identified as Rana Usman, Ashfaque Ali, Salman Sajjad, and Wajid Ali.According to the court order, dated Jan 24, the four individuals were sentenced to death by hanging for using derogatory remarks against the Holy Prophet. They were also sentenced to life in prison for defiling the Holy Quran and to 10 years’ imprisonment for deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs. “All the sentences shall run concurrently,” the order read.The prosecution lawyer said the case was supported by forensic evidence from the devices used. The men’s lawyer, Manzoor Rahmani, criticised the court’s order, saying doubts and uncertainties that arise in such cases are ignored by the courts, likely due to fear of a religious backlash and potential mob violence against the judge if the accused is acquitted.“We are preparing our appeals against the decision and will go to the high court,” Rahmani said. A member of a support group formed by the families of the accused was quoted by media as saying the pattern of arrests and prosecutions in this case was consistent with previous ones.“We urge the government to establish a commission to investigate the rise in these cases before these young individuals spend the best years of their lives behind bars,” said the support group member.Critics say blasphemy accusations, whether true or false, often lead to lengthy prison sentences on death row and solitary confinement. The laws, according to them, are often abused to settle scores or used to target members of Pakistan’s religious minorities.Hundreds of people have been accused of blasphemy since the draconian laws were introduced by former dictator Gen Zia-ul-Haq in the 1980s.

The lack of safeguards against false accusations has led to numerous cases where individuals face imprisonment, violence, or even extrajudicial killings without substantial evidence.The blasphemy laws have sparked national and international debates about human rights and freedom of expression in Pakistan.Activists argue that these laws suppress religious minorities, limit free speech, and create a climate of fear, while conservative groups strongly defend them as essential to protecting Islam.High-profile cases, such as those of Asia Bibi and Salman Taseer, have highlighted the deep divisions in Pakistani society regarding these laws. Successive governments have been reluctant to amend or repeal the legislation due to the risk of backlash from religious hardliners. As a result, blasphemy remains a highly sensitive issue, with calls for legal reforms often met with strong resistance.","Pakistani court awards death penalty to four men for ""online blasphemy"" against the Prophet Mohammed and the Islamic holy book Quran.

SINDH: A large protest march, organised by the Awami Tehreek (AT), took place from Gozo to KN Shah, with participants rallying against corporate farming and the construction of six new canals in Sindh, Dawn reported.The protesters demanded that Sindh's land be allocated to local, landless farmers rather than corporate entities.The march saw active participation from women and children, with villagers along the route warmly welcoming the demonstrators.

Katiar warned, ""This will lead to a crisis in Sindh,"" and accused former President Asif Zardari of violating the Constitution by approving the construction of six new canals, as highlighted by Dawn.AT general secretary advocate Sajid Hussain Mahesar also addressed the crowd, criticising the coalition government for advancing the canal projects. He described them as an attack on the vision of Pakistan's founder, Quaid-i-Azam.Mahesar revealed that ""67,651 acres of land in Kachho had been handed over to foreign investors for corporate farming,"" jeopardising the livelihoods of local farmers and undermining Sindh's autonomy, Dawn reported.Advocate Raheel Bhutto strongly opposed the allocation of 10,000 acres in Gorakh Hill to a private firm, stating, ""This move is an assault not only on Sindh's lands but on its culture and heritage.""Bhutto warned, ""If the PPP government does not take action, the people of Sindh will hold them accountable, just as they have done with past dictatorial regimes.""The protest concluded with powerful slogans demanding the cancellation of the new canals, an end to corporate farming, and the protection of Sindh's lands, rivers, and cultural heritage.","A large protest march, organised by the Awami Tehreek (AT), took place from Gozo to KN Shah.

Six of the petitioners appeared in court on Friday after the case was set for hearing.They claimed that it was the responsibility of the respondents to protect and provide a safe environment for all foreign citizens legally staying and investing in the country, including the petitioners.The petitioners said the Sindh police had engaged in repeated acts of harassment over the last six to seven months, including unwarrantedly restricting movement of Chinese nationals in Karachi and Sindh and unjustified detentions within their residences on the pretext of “security issues” without any clear legal grounds or specific incidents to justify such actions.They also claimed that the policemen stationed at their homes literally locked them in and restricted their movement within the confines of their houses, and that when the petitioners bowed to their illegal demands of paying Pakistani Rs 30,000 ($110) to Rs 50,000 ($182), they were let go.The petitioners also stated that officers from Sukhan police station (in Sindh) had recently sealed seven industrial units of other Chinese nationals without prior notice, citing security reasons.They added that their problems began when they arrived at the airport where officials refused to let them enter the country unless they were bribed, despite having all legally required papers.They also accused police of allegedly throwing stones at their vehicles and smashing the rear screens of their cars, and that the deployed policemen appeared indecent and unprofessionally trained. They cited complaints against them for disturbing privacy and demanding tips ranging from Pakistani Rs 15,000 ($55) to Rs 50,000 ($182).The petition also referenced an incident in which three Chinese female investors were forced to return to China after being treated disrespectfully at a Karachi expo centre. They warned that unless the authorities intervened they would either return to Lahore or leave the country altogether.The petitioners requested the HC to direct the authorities to respect the rights of Chinese nationals in conformity with international laws.

LAHORE: A Pakistani court has awarded a death sentence and 80-year imprisonment to four persons for uploading blasphemous content on Facebook , an official said on Saturday. Additional Sessions Judge Mohammad Tariq Ayub on Friday convicted four suspects -- Wajid Ali, Ahfaq Ali Saqib, Rana Usman and Suleman Sajid -- for insulting Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), his companions, and his wives.The court official said the convicts uploaded blasphemous content on Facebook from four different IDs.""The judge after hearing arguments of both prosecution and defence and witnesses accounts awarded the death penalty and 80 years imprisonment to each of them on different counts,"" the official said.They were also slapped with a fine of PKR 5.2 million.Pakistan's Federal Investigation (FIA) Cybercrime registered a case under Section 11 of the PECA (Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act) and 295A, 295B, 295C, 298A, 109 and 34 of the Pakistan Penal Code on the complaint of Shiraz Farooqi, a citizen.According to Amnesty International , Pakistan's blasphemy laws are often used against religious minorities and others who are the target of false accusations, while emboldening vigilantes prepared to threaten or kill the accused.""There is overwhelming evidence that Pakistan's blasphemy laws violate human rights and encourage people to take the law into their own hands. Once a person is accused, they become ensnared in a system that offers them few protections, presumes them guilty, and fails to safeguard them against people willing to use violence,"" it said.Amnesty International added that in perversion of the justice system, the accused are often presumed to be guilty based on little or no evidence.""Once an accusation of blasphemy is made, the police can arrest the accused, without even checking to see if the charges make sense. Bowing to public pressure from angry crowds, including religious clerics and their supporters, they frequently pass cases on to prosecutors without scrutinising the evidence. And once someone is charged, they can be denied bail and face lengthy and unfair trials,"" it said.",A Pakistani court has awarded a death sentence and 80-year imprisonment to four persons for uploading blasphemous content on Facebook.

Pakistan’s parliament places curbs on social media,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-parliament-places-curbs-on-social-media/articleshow/117496291.cms,"This is a representational image

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s National Assembly approved on Thursday amendments to the Pakistan Electronic Crimes Act (Peca), granting govt unbridled powers to regulate and control social media platforms, including the authority to send users to prison for spreading disinformation.The bill was hastily passed after opposition lawmakers staged a walkout to denounce the law. The legislation sparked widespread protests, particularly among journalists, with critics saying the govt is seeking to further suppress freedom of speech.The Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, introduced in the National Assembly on Wednesday, would establish an agency with the authority to order the immediate removal of “unlawful and offensive” content from social media, such as content critical of judges, the armed forces, parliament, or provincial assemblies. Individuals and companies who post such content may also be blocked on social media.The law requires social media platforms to register with the new Social Media Protection and Regulatory Authority, and those that do not comply may face temporary or permanent bans. The bill also makes misinformation a criminal offence punishable with three years in prison and a Pakistani Rs 2 million fine ($7,150).Govt’s decision to ratify the bill comes nearly a year after Pakistan blocked the platform ‘X’ ahead of an election that Imran Khan’s opposition party claims was rigged. ‘X’ is still restricted in the country, but many individuals use virtual private networks to get around it, much like in other countries with strict internet censorship.The law also broadens the definition of prohibited content to include material that promotes violence, bigotry, or defamation, as well as content that is harmful to national security.The legislation was passed with overwhelming support in the National Assembly, despite protests from members of the press.As the bill was introduced, journalists staged a walkout from the press gallery in protest, condemning what they called restrictions on press freedom and the potential for govt overreach in regulating online discourse.The Peca amendments also pave the way for a new social media protection tribunal to expedite cases involving online crimes, with the tribunal required to resolve cases within 90 days.Furthermore, the bill proposes the dissolution of the Federal Investigation Agency’s (FIA) cyber crime wing, with its responsibilities transferring to the newly established National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency.Opposition leaders have voiced strong concerns over the amendments, accusing the government of using the law to suppress dissent and limit freedom of expression online. The current govt, however, maintains that the changes are necessary to safeguard the public from harmful and illegal content that could disrupt national security.","Pakistan's National Assembly approved amendments to the Pakistan Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) The bill was hastily passed after opposition lawmakers staged a walkout to denounce the law.

Individuals and organisations posting such content can also be blocked from platforms.Spreading ""disinformation"" is now a criminal offence, punishable by up to three years in prison and a substantial fine of 2 million Pakistani rupees ($7,150).This law has alarmed human rights activists like Farhatullah Babar, who warned that the law ""stifles the freedom of expression"" and grants excessive power to the executive branch.The opposition strongly condemned the legislation. The leader of the opposition, Omar Ayub Khan , said that the bill could ""lay a foundation for the suppression of voices advocating for constitutional rights."" The party of the jailed former leader, Imran Khan , has stopped any further negotiations with the government. They ended these talks because of this new law, which they believe is unfair and harmful.Journalists and media organisations have also expressed deep concern. The Federal Union of Journalists president, Afzal Butt, called the law an attempt to ""suppress the media, social media and journalists.""While the government claims the law is necessary to combat the spread of misinformation and hate speech, critics argue it will be used to silence dissent and control public discourse.

Bangladesh interim govt seeks removal of Sheikh Hasina's daughter Saima Wazed from WHO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-interim-govt-seeks-removal-of-sheikh-hasinas-daughter-from-who/articleshow/117592664.cms,"DHAKA: Bangladesh's interim government has started preparations to take action to remove Saima Wazed , the daughter of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina , from her position as the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Director for South-East Asia.Saima Wazed, based in Delhi, is a psychologist by training and has worked extensively on neurodevelopmental disorders. She was confirmed as the WHO Regional Director on January 23, 2024, by the WHO Executive Board in Geneva.However, the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) of Bangladesh is investigating her for alleged corruption charges. An official stated, ""ACC has taken necessary steps to remove Saima Wazed from WHO. All preparations have been finalized to send letters to the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to take measures to remove her.""In August last year, a student-led movement ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina after weeks of protests that resulted in over 600 deaths. Hasina, 76, fled to India, and an interim government led by Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus was formed.Despite the change in government, a lawyer in Dhaka explained, ""If someone elected after a country's nomination to a United Nations body, he or she remains in position in his or her individual capacity, despite the country's government falls.""The political turmoil in Bangladesh has also spilled over to international politics. Recently, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer faced another setback with the resignation of anti-corruption minister Tulip Siddiq . Siddiq, 42, the niece of Sheikh Hasina, was implicated in an embezzlement investigation tied to Bangladesh.Siddiq clarified her position on X, stating, ""An independent review has confirmed that I have not breached the Ministerial Code and there is no evidence to suggest I have acted improperly. Nonetheless, to avoid distraction for the Government, I have resigned as City Minister."" She also explained that her family connections were disclosed, and she recused herself from matters related to Bangladesh to avoid any perception of conflict of interest.Hasina, who fled Bangladesh last year, has been living in India since August 5. The fallout from these events has significantly affected the political landscape in Bangladesh and has drawn international attention. Despite the investigations and political instability, Wazed remains in her position at WHO, as the case continues.","Saima Wazed is a psychologist by training and has worked extensively on neurodevelopmental disorders.

Why is poliovirus spreading from Afghanistan to Pakistan?



Getting back to successful mass polio immunization programs



Bhutta: Work with the Taliban on polio eradication



Before the development of the first poliovirus vaccine in 1955, poliomyelitis paralysed and killed up to half a million people every year.By 2000, mass vaccination campaigns, armed with new types of oral polio vaccines, had almost eradicated wild poliovirus, except for a few isolated regions.In 2020, the whole African region was declared free of wild poliovirus, leaving just two countries yet to stop the spread of the disease: Afghanistan and Pakistan.Mass immunization programs had Pakistan on the brink of eradicating polio in 2023, with just six remaining cases of the wild form of the virus. But now, cases are climbing again — 73 cases were reported in 2024.""It has spread to all districts of Pakistan. We've snatched defeat from the jaws of victory,"" said Zulfiqar Bhutta , Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada.The reason, Bhutta writes in a commentary in the Lancet, is that cases of poliovirus are spilling over the border from Afghanistan. The genetic strains of wild poliovirus in Pakistan are all from Afghanistan.Bhutta leads groups working on child immunization strategies in conflict zones. He was involved in the largest trials of poliovirus vaccine interventions in Afghanistan, working ""very successfully"" with the Taliban until a year ago.But poliovirus eradication programs have faced multiple setbacks over the years since the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in 2021. Public health officials say "" vaccine hesitancy "" (when people don't want to take vaccines), poor sanitary conditions and regional insecurity have all sabotaged vaccination efforts.Bhutta, who was back in Afghanistan in December, said the Taliban did not allow female health professionals to work, and that impedes public programs, including vaccinations.""Some health workers have got into the communities. But they've somehow dispersed the goddamn poliovirus over the entire area,"" Bhutta said.Now, health authorities do not have reliable data on the number of poliovirus cases in Afghanistan. The poliovirus can cause paralysis in extreme cases, especially young children, and can be fatal if the virus affects breathing muscles.""It's a virus that does not want to be eradicated, so give it an inch and it will take a yard,"" Bhutta said.Pakistan has spent an estimated $10 billion on poliovirus immunization programs in the region since 2011. Despite two decades of challenges, including political instability, drone strikes in its tribal areas, and conflict in Afghanistan, the program almost succeeded in completely eradicating polio within Pakistan's borders.But provinces in Pakistan have different immunization rates. While in Punjab, 85% of children are vaccinated, rates are as low as 30% in Balochistan. Until vaccine coverage reaches 85-90% in all provinces, it is unlikely wild poliovirus will be fully eradicated from the region.Bhutta is calling for a major strategic review to strengthen routine immunization programs, not just for polio, but for other infectious diseases, as well.""This is how countries like India eradicated polio,"" Bhutta said. ""They strengthened their routine immunization programs at the same time.""""It can certainly work in Pakistan,"" Bhutta said. ""It's a question of where you want to put resources.""Eradicating poliovirus in the region is impossible, Bhutta said, unless international and Pakistan-based health authorities work with the Taliban government in Afghanistan — which they don't at the moment. Until then, cases will continue to spill over the border, he said.International health agencies have worked with the Taliban before to deliver smallpox vaccines during periods of negotiated peace, when health workers could go in and give the vaccine.""Taliban are not the enemy. Ultimately, they have the same health concerns that everyone else does,"" Bhutta said.What's crucial to eradicate polio in the region, he said, is to address general health programs for women and children, not just polio. Without proper sanitation and broader disease prevention programs, polio will just come back.According to data from the WHO, suspected cases of several infectious diseases, including pneumonia, dengue fever and measles, have been rising in Afghanistan in the last six months.""There are so many health needs in this region, needs for children with malnutrition, needs for children with disease prevention and management. To go in and say all we want to do is polio, does not make sense,"" Bhutta said.","Polio has spread to all districts of Pakistan. The genetic strains of wild poliovirus in Pakistan are all from Afghanistan. Until vaccine coverage reaches 85-90% in all provinces, it is unlikely wild pol Giovirus will be fully eradicated from the region.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117543630,imgsize-1272268,width-400,resizemode-4/117543630.jpg"

"Bomb cyclone hits northwest US, causing major disruptions; power outages affect thousands",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/bomb-cyclone-hits-northwest-us-causing-major-disruptions-power-outages-affect-thousands/articleshow/115469396.cms,"A powerful storm system hit the northwest US on Tuesday evening, causing widespread power outages and tree damage across the region.The weather prediction centre announced risks of excessive rainfall from Tuesday through Friday, as the region faces its strongest atmospheric river of the season. The system has been classified as a "" bomb cyclone "" due to its rapid intensification.According to Richard Bann, a national weather service meteorologist, the most severe rainfall is expected between Portland, Oregon, and the northern San Francisco area. He cautioned about flash flooding risks at lower elevations and winter storms at higher altitudes, emphasising the storm's significant impact.Near Seattle and along the Oregon coast, hurricane-force winds exceeding 75 mph (121 kph) were anticipated. Larry O'Neill, Oregon climate service director, warned about a ""mountain wave"" near Seattle that could trigger widespread power disruptions.By Tuesday evening, approximately 94,000 customers in western Washington and 12,000 in Oregon experienced power outages. The National Weather Service recorded peak wind speeds of 68 mph (109 kph) at Crystal Mountain and 53 mph (82 kph) at Ediz Hook.Northern California faced flood and high wind watches, with predictions of up to 8 inches (20 centimetres) of rain in various regions. The Sierra Nevada mountains were under a winter storm watch above 3,500 feet (1,066 metres).In Yolo County, California, crews worked to prevent flooding by clearing drainage systems. Resident Mesena Pimentel recalled February's floods, telling KCRA-TV, ""We had about ten inches of water in our garage, had a couple gophers swimming around.""Southwestern Oregon anticipated 4 to 7 inches (10 to 18 centimetres) of rainfall through Friday morning, with some areas possibly receiving up to 10 inches (25 centimetres).The Oregon coast received high wind warnings starting at 4 pm Tuesday, with expected gusts up to 70 mph (113 kph) on beaches. Washington state faced less severe rainfall but significant wind threats, particularly in Pacific County.The Cascades in Washington, including Mount Rainier National Park, received blizzard warnings with predictions of heavy snow and strong winds. Washington State Ferries reported service disruptions, and transport officials advised postponing travel until Wednesday.The Washington state department of transportation said, ""It will only be a winter wonderland in the sense that you'll be wondering where the heck you are on any given patch of land.""","Storm system has been classified as a "" bomb cyclone "" due to its rapid intensification.

"Out of picture: Biden, Trudeau and Meloni miss 'family photo' at G20",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/out-of-picture-biden-trudeau-and-meloni-miss-family-photo-at-g20/articleshow/115469057.cms,"Under sunshine and clear blue skies against a picture-perfect backdrop of Rio's iconic Sugarloaf Mountain, the Group of 20 leaders gathered for their ""family photo"". There was just one snag: US President Joe Biden was missing. The traditional photo opportunity descended into farce on Monday when Biden, Canada PM Justin Trudeau and Italian premier Giorgia Meloni were absent from the lineup.That only became clear, though, once Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva had posed for the snap with the other world leaders, after which they dispersed for further talks. Was it perhaps an act of protest against the presence of Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, who was standing in for President Putin? Or had some bilateral meetings run late? In the end, it seems it was down to disorganisation.A US official blamed logistical issues and said the ""family photo"" was taken early. Biden's absence wasn't an act of protest, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The Brazilian organizers say Biden and the others were late. They may try to herd all the leaders together again for a reshoot - which would be a first in the history of the G-20.But the symbolism was unmistakable. The West appeared in disarray. That allowed China's Xi Jinping to stroll in and take center stage. Brazil's Lula was flanked by the previous G20 host - India's Narendra Modi - and the next one - South Africa's Cyril Ramaphosa. Argentina's Javier Milei, who has been a thorn in Lula's side, was lurking just behind him and next to France's Emmanuel Macron. Lavrov was safely tucked away at the back next to his Saudi counterpart.UK PM Keir Starmer walked out into the sun alone. Earlier he'd irked Xi by publicly chiding China on human rights and Taiwan. The chill between the two was palpable as they studiously avoided contact, separated only by Australian PM Anthony Albanese.The adage that a picture is worth a thousand words couldn't be truer when it comes to the annual G20 family photo. Since its foundation in 1999, this snapshot in time tells the story of the rise and fall of collaboration between the world's most powerful economies.The plan today was to invite everyone and paper over the cracks in global diplomacy. Lula literally hoped to drown out the differences by having more people in the frame. Instead, as Xi was holding hands with fellow leaders and smiling, Meloni came to realise she and Trudeau were missing out. As per a pool report, she gasped and said ""The photo!""","The traditional photo opportunity descended into farce on Monday.

Hush money trial: DA suggests freezing Trump case while he is president,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hush-money-trial-da-suggests-freezing-trump-case-while-he-is-president/articleshow/115469003.cms,"Manhattan prosecutors on Tuesday rebuffed President-elect Donald Trump's request to dismiss his criminal conviction in the wake of his electoral victory, signalling instead their willingness to freeze the case while he holds office.In a letter to the judge overseeing the case, the prosecutors emphasised that a jury had already convicted Trump of falsifying records to cover up a sex scandal.But acknowledging the unprecedented nature of the case - Trump would be the first felon to serve as president - the prosecutors raised the prospect of a four-year freeze. ""The people deeply respect the office of the president, are mindful of the demands and obligations of the presidency, and acknowledge that defendant's inauguration will raise unprecedented legal questions,"" prosecutors from the Manhattan district attorney's office wrote to the judge, Juan Merchan. ""We also deeply respect the fundamental role of the jury in our constitutional system.""Eager to clear his criminal record, Trump is now expected to move forcefully for a dismissal, setting in motion a legal battle that could shadow his second presidential term and ultimately reach the US Supreme Court. That fight will almost certainly further delay Trump's sentencing, which was scheduled for next week.In court records last week that hinted at a Supreme Court challenge, Trump's lawyers argued that dismissing the case would ""avoid unconstitutional impediments to Trump's ability to govern."" Doing so, they added, was ""in the interests of justice.""The district attorney, Alvin L Bragg, took a week to deliberate before delivering Tuesday's much-anticipated response. His options were limited and unappealing: He could have either dropped the case, a move that would have alienated his liberal Manhattan base, or proposed some way to pause it, potentially intensifying Trump's ire and drawing a legal challenge. Ultimately, Bragg, the first prosecutor in the country to indict and convict a former president, opted to stand behind the jury's verdict.","Manhattan prosecutors rebuffed Donald Trump's request to dismiss his criminal conviction.

It declined to comment further.The companies that own the two cables both said it was not yet clear what had caused the outages.""It's not a partial damage, it's full damage,"" said a spokesperson for Arelion, owner and operator of the cable linking Lithuania and Sweden.

Bomb Cyclone: What is bomb cyclone? Severe winter storm threatens to unleash chaos across US states,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-is-bomb-cyclone-severe-winter-storm-threatens-to-unleash-chaos-across-us-states/articleshow/115443054.cms,"Bomb Cyclone: What is it?

Storm to intensify rapidly this week

A severe weather system known as the Bomb Cyclone is approaching the US coast , threatening to cause widespread disruption across multiple states. This significant meteorological event will bring intense winds, substantial rainfall and considerable snowfall in mountainous regions, accompanied by a Category 5 atmospheric river. Scientists predict that California and other states will receive more than eight trillion gallons of precipitation.These intense winter storms , known as Bomb Cyclones , are characterised by rapid temperature drops of 24 millibars within 24 hours. This particular system is predicted to experience a pressure reduction of approximately 70 millibars in one day, falling to 942 millibars. According to Weather Nation, these parameters vary with elevation. Such severe conditions are comparable to Category 4 hurricanes.The term 'bomb cyclone' was established by meteorologists in the 1980s, referring to the rapid intensification of weather patterns. These systems strengthen by drawing warm, humid tropical air, creating an atmospheric river that delivers substantial precipitation and powerful winds.The current system targeting the West Coast is expected to fully engage with the atmospheric river.Weather predictions indicate that between Tuesday and Thursday, the approaching storm will experience a dramatic pressure decrease of 50 to 60 millibars within 24 hours. Beginning at over 1000 millibars on Monday night, the pressure could fall below 950 millibars by Tuesday night. Lower pressure readings indicate increasingstorm intensity .The University of California in San Diego developed a 1-to-5 scale to assess these impacts. Coastal California regions are anticipated to face Category 4 (""extreme"") conditions, with rainfall expected from Tuesday night through Thursday. Precipitation levels exceeding twelve inches are possible in Southern Oregon and Northern California, likely resulting in river and flash flooding.Residents in flood-prone areas are advised to remain vigilant and prepare for possible evacuation.","Storm to intensify rapidly this week.

Donald Trump confirms he will declare national emergency and use military for mass deportation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-confirms-he-will-declare-national-emergency-and-use-military-for-mass-deportation/articleshow/115424060.cms,"US President-elect Donald Trump (File photo)

TOI Correspondent from Washington:

US President-elect and MAGA supremo Donald Trump confirmed on Monday that his administration will declare a national emergency and use military assets in a mass deportation program to ""reverse the Biden invasion.""Trump responded with a single-word response (""True!"") to a week-old post from a rightwing commentator who said there are reports to this effect, even as the President-elect's putative border czar Tom Homan warned Democratic-governed states that have said they will not cooperate with the deportation program to ""get the hell out of our way.""""All this crap ends on January 20...Federal law trumps state law every single time,"" Homan said in a podcast in a warning to Democrat governors of California, Illinois, and Massachusetts who have suggested they will resist the incoming administration's mass deportation plans.Promising ""shock and awe"" from day one, Homan said the Trump administration will prioritize public safety and national security to first deport 425,000 illegal immigrants with criminal records. Asserting that there were millions of deserving immigrants and asylum seekers who had been pushed to the back of the line by the invasion of illegals, he said immigrants will get due process in court of law, and if they lose, they will have to return to their country. In a separate appearance on Fox Business, Homan said “legal immigrants are perfectly safe.”Describing his personal experience on the border, Homan said he resented the fact that border patrol agents who are mandated to stop the illegal invasion has been turned into ""travel agents' tasked with processing illegal immigrants and putting them on onward flights into the US, giving them free airline tickets, free hotel stay, and free health care at tax payer expense while millions of Americans were suffering.Illegal immigration , along with inflation and price rise, were among the key factors that powered Trump's return to the White House for a second term, and the President-elect appears on track to make good his mass deportation pledge amid doubts about the feasibility of sending back upwards of 10 million illegals, many of whom are seasonal agricultural workers.Liberal activists have warned that turfing them out result in a hike in grocery prices. More extreme scenarios paint a picture of economic collapse even as some think tanks have estimated it would cost upward of $ 300 billion to nearly $ 1 trillion to get all the illegal immigrants out of the country -- which is considered impossible.""Mass deportations would cause significant labor shocks across multiple key industries, with especially acute impacts on construction, agriculture, and the hospitality sector,"" the American Immigration Council has warned, estimating that nearly 14 percent of people employed in the construction industry are undocumented. ""Removing that labor would disrupt all forms of construction across the nation, from homes to businesses to basic infrastructure. As industries suffer, hundreds of thousands of U.S.-born workers could lose their jobs,"" it said.In an October 2024 report, the AIC estimated that mass deportation would reduce the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) by 4.2 to 6.8 percent. It would also result in significant reduction in tax revenues for the U.S. government. In 2022 alone, undocumented immigrant households paid $46.8 billion in federal taxes and $29.3 billion in state and local taxes, and contributed $22.6 billion to Social Security and $5.7 billion to Medicare.These numbers, the AIC said, do not even come close to capturing the human cost of mass deportation: About 5.1 million US citizen children live with an undocumented family member. ""Separating family members would lead to tremendous emotional stress and could also cause economic hardship for many of these mixed-status families who might lose their breadwinners, jeopardizing their economic and social well-being,"" it cautioned.","US President-elect and MAGA supremo Donald Trump confirmed on Monday that his administration will declare a national emergency and use military assets in a mass deportation program.

Putin approves updated Russian nuclear doctrine: All you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/russia-updates-nuclear-doctrine-day-after-us-allows-ukraine-to-use-their-missiles/articleshow/115445923.cms,"Putin's Nuclear Order: 'Fire Missile On Russia, Face Nukes' | Doctrine Revised After Biden's Trigger

MOSCOW: Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday approved an updated nuclear doctrine that positions any conventional attack on Russia, when supported by a nuclear-armed ally, as a joint assault on the country.This change comes amid heightened concerns over Western involvement in the Ukraine conflict, with Kremlin officials citing the doctrine as a necessary response to recent US military support for Ukraine .According to the official document published on the government website, the revised policy stresses Moscow’s intent to protect its national security as Western nations expand military backing to Kyiv.Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told TASS that these revisions “have already been practically formulated” and will “be formalised as necessary.” Peskov highlighted Moscow’s unease following Washington’s approval for Ukraine to use US-supplied missiles against Russian military targets.“They [the changes] have already been practically formulated. They will be formalised as necessary,” Peskov said.The Kremlin responded to reports that Ukraine may use US-supplied ATACMS missiles in Russia's Kursk region, with assurances that “our military is monitoring the situation very closely.” In response to concerns that Russia might initiate nuclear action, the Kremlin reiterated its position: “Russia has always viewed nuclear weapons as a means of deterrence, an extreme measure,” intended only for the most severe circumstances.This policy update follows the Biden administration’s decision to grant Ukraine access to American missiles for long-range strikes on Russian positions, which Moscow condemned as a “reckless” move that could dangerously escalate the conflict. The Kremlin has vowed to respond to what it views as a direct provocation.In comments made in September, Putin had warned that any Western endorsement of Ukraine’s use of long-range missiles would mean “the direct involvement of Natocountries, the United States, and European countries in the war in Ukraine,” noting the reliance on Nato’s military personnel and targeting infrastructure.The US decision to support these Ukrainian strikes comes after months of appeals from President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has argued for additional firepower to strike Russian targets within his country’s borders. According to reports, Washington’s shift in policy was also driven by concerns over North Korean troops recently deployed to bolster Russian forces, a development that has raised alarms in both Washington and Kyiv.The Kremlin’s revised nuclear policy was finalised just weeks ahead of the November US presidential election, further escalating tensions in a conflict that many analysts see as the most dangerous standoff between Moscow and the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.On Tuesday, Peskov indicated that while Russia is open to improving relations with the United States, mutual cooperation is essential. “We are ready to normalise ties with Washington,” he said. “But we cannot tango alone, and we are not going to do it.”","Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday approved an updated nuclear doctrine.

Do the Donald! Trump's signature dance finds its way into US sports world,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/do-the-donald-trumps-signature-dance-finds-its-way-into-us-sports-world/articleshow/115468679.cms,"The first thing to know about the Donald Trump dance craze is that it's not really a craze. (Not yet, at least.) Nor, to be honest, is it a dance.What is certain, however, is that the president-elect's signature shimmy is en vogue with all manner of professional athletes, imitated by at least five NFL players Sunday, as well as by Jon Jones, the heavyweight champion of the UFC, who seemingly helped spread the fad Saturday after knocking out Stipe Miocic in the third round.Jones celebrated by rocking from hip to hip and pumping his fists at waist level - both hallmarks of Trump's dancing - before pointing his finger at Trump, who was sitting ringside at the fight in New York. Trump, never one to pass up a compliment, beamed in the moment and soon reposted Jones' performance on Truth Social. Trump's embrace of events like UFC fights and football games - both brimming with machismo - was viewed during the campaign as part of a broader effort to appeal to young men.The support of Trump's moves from prominent athletes came after he had trailed his opponent, vice president Kamala Harris, in terms of big-name celebrity endorsements. His resounding victory November 5, however, has resulted in an increasing trickle of congratulations from famous people - a diverse cohort including the likes of Caitlyn Jenner and Sylvester Stallone. Jones and the NFL players expanded that circle even more.Trump's physical enjoyment of music has been a staple of his campaigns for years, including at an Oct town hall where a pair of medical emergencies in the crowd led to lengthy delays, during which the Republican candidate bobbed his head to the Village People's ""Y.M.C.A"".Both simple and strangely hypnotic, Trump's wiggle incorporates the kind of stiff swivel often employed by arrhythmic wedding guests or awkward, one-too-many conventioneers. Sunday saw more variations emerging, from NFL players like Brock Bowers who did a quick end zone dance with the Trumpian boogie. ""I saw it and thought it was cool,"" he said.While Trump is the dance's originator, various sources credit another NFL player - Nick Bosa - for its broader popularisation, after he did Trump's dance on November 10 in the wake of a sack.

This selection continues Trump's pattern of appointing television personalities to federal agencies, with his Defence and Transportation nominees coming from Fox News and Fox Business.The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services administers major government programmes providing healthcare coverage to over 150 million Americans. They control health insurance regulations and establish policies determining payments for medical services to doctors, hospitals and pharmaceutical companies.The centres manage approximately 25% of federal expenditure. Operating within the department of health and human services alongside the food and drug administration, national institutes of health and centers for disease control and prevention, the centres' significant influence often receives less attention than these other divisions.""CMS touches virtually every family in America through Medicaid and Medicare, and it's probably the most challenging technical, policy and political job in government,"" said Drew Altman, the president of KFF, a health research group. ""Even small almost daily decisions at CMS are billion-dollar decisions that affect industries and patients with serious illnesses who really care.""Trump's announcement said that Oz would ""work closely with Robert F Kennedy Jr to take on the illness industrial complex, and all the horrible chronic diseases left in its wake."" He highlighted Oz's nine Daytime Emmy Awards for 'The Dr Oz Show,' noting his contribution to public health education.Oz, a cardiac surgeon with Turkish heritage, lacks experience in federal administration. He previously advocated for universal health coverage through private Medicare Advantage plans, funded by a 20% payroll tax, replacing employer health coverage and government Medicare.This approach differs significantly from conventional conservative health policy. In 2019, then-presidential candidate Kamala Harris proposed a similar 'Medicare for All' plan, offering choice between government Medicare and Medicare advantage-style plans.Oz faces questions about Medicaid, which serves over 70 million disadvantaged Americans. Republican legislators advocate significant programme modifications, including federal funding reductions and stricter eligibility requirements.The agency also manages Obamacare insurance marketplaces. While Oz supports expanded health coverage, he has criticised the law's implementation. His controversial positions include promoting unproven COVID-19 treatments and weight loss products, and opposing pandemic restrictions during his Senate campaign.","US President-elect Donald Trump announced on Tuesday his nomination of Dr Mehmet Oz as administrator of the centers for Medicare and Medicaid services.

Instead, it was guided to land in the Gulf of Mexico.The launch event highlighted the growing alliance between them, with potential implications for American politics, governance, foreign policy, and space exploration, including potential human missions to Mars.Having contributed approximately $200 million towards Trump's victory over Democrat Kamala Harris, Musk has gained unprecedented access.

What makes E-4B 'Nightwatch' a key player in US national security?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-makes-e-4b-nightwatch-a-key-player-in-us-national-security/articleshow/115464569.cms,"E-4B 'Nightwatch' (Picture credit: US Air Force)

Unmatched capabilities

Training and operational costs

A flexible and self-sufficient aircraft

Secretary of defense's trusted companion

While Air Force One is often recognized as the US president’s ""flying Oval Office,"" the E-4B ""Nightwatch"" plays an even more crucial role in national security. Often referred to as a ""flying war room,"" this highly specialized aircraft is designed to serve as a mobile command center in the event of a nuclear crisis, ensuring the safety of the president, senior officials, and key military leaders.The E-4B, a militarized version of the Boeing 747-200, is equipped with advanced technology and defense systems that allow it to operate in extreme conditions. Its primary purpose is to maintain command and control over military operations during a crisis, especially in the event of a nuclear attack. Unlike Air Force One, which serves as the president's mobile office, the E-4B is built to withstand a nuclear blast and maintain secure communications under all circumstances.The plane's impressive features include a ""ray dome"" on top, housing 67 satellite dishes and antennas that provide the E-4B with far more communication capabilities than Air Force One. Additionally, its exterior is shielded against thermal and nuclear effects, and its electrical systems are designed to resist electromagnetic pulses (EMPs).Operating the E-4B is no small feat. In 2022, the US Air Force invested $9.5 million in a simulator to train E-4B crews, including pilots and flight engineers. These high operational costs are necessary to ensure the aircraft can remain airborne for extended periods—up to 12 hours without refueling, and indefinitely with mid-air refueling capabilities.The E-4B's main deck is divided into six functional areas: a command room, conference room, briefing room, operations work area, communications room, and rest area. This design allows officials to manage crisis situations, hold meetings, and communicate with both domestic and international contacts while in the air. The plane can accommodate up to 112 people, including the president, senior military leaders, and essential staff.Beyond its role in supporting presidential operations, the E-4B is also used by the secretary of defense for international travel. The plane ensures the secretary has secure communications and a fully functional command center wherever they go, providing a level of continuity even in the most unstable global environments.The E-4B also serves as a press briefing location when the secretary of defense is abroad, ensuring that crucial information can be communicated seamlessly during high-stakes situations.","The E-4B is a militarized version of the Boeing 747-200.

The thumbnail featured a collage of a man in an orange prison jumpsuit sitting in a wheelchair in a courtroom, alongside an image of the same individual appearing to collapse.However, the claims made in the video are unsubstantiated, as Combs’ trial has not yet begun. No life sentence has been issued, and legal proceedings are still underway. Moreover, no hearings involving Combs have been live-streamed, making the existence of such footage impossible.Diddy has been accused of kidnapping, drugging, and coercing women into sexual acts, allegedly using firearms and threats of violence. In March, police raided his Los Angeles mansion, which had hosted his birthday party, and reportedly confiscated items intended for events described as ""freak-offs,"" including drugs and over 1,000 bottles of baby oil. Combs has denied all allegations and entered a not guilty plea.Despite two previous bail requests being denied, Combs' attorneys have filed a third appeal, citing newly discovered evidence. Prosecutors argue, however, that his alleged attempts to influence witnesses from jail demonstrate a disregard for legal processes.Combs is scheduled to appear before US District Judge Arun Subramanian in Manhattan on Tuesday at 3 pm EDT (2000 GMT) for a bail hearing.

His extensive connections with CEOs and the business community make him a strategic choice for the role.Lutnick’s leadership would also place him at the forefront of the US-China tech competition. The Commerce Department plays a vital role in enforcing policies to limit China’s access to critical technologies, such as semiconductors and advanced manufacturing equipment. These measures are designed to curb China’s advancements in artificial intelligence and hinder major tech firms like Huawei and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation.While Lutnick has not frequently addressed US-China relations, he is a staunch proponent of tariffs targeting Beijing.

A man, Brandon Durham, was shot and killed by police in his own house in Las Vegas , Nevada, US, after calling 911 to report a potential home invasion. The incident occurred early on November 12, when Durham, 43, was reportedly struggling with an intruder, later identified as 31-year-old Alejandra Boudreaux, over a knife.Bodycam footage released by the Las Vegas Metro Police Department shows a confrontation between Durham and Boudreaux, with Boudreaux wearing a red hoodie and Durham shirtless.On the morning of November 12, Las Vegas Metropolitan Police received multiple 911 calls about a shooting on Wine River Drive. Durham, who was at home with his 15-year-old daughter, told the dispatcher that someone had broken into his house and was shooting at him, according to assistant sheriff Dori Koren.When Officer Alexander Bookman and two other officers arrived, they saw damaged cars and windows and heard loud noises and screams from inside Durham's home. Bookman forcibly entered the front door and, upon entering, found Durham and Boudreaux struggling over a knife in a bedroom doorway. Durham's daughter was not present during the struggle.Bookman ordered them to drop the knife and fired his weapon, striking Durham, causing him to fall to the floor. The officer then discharged five more rounds, fatally shooting Durham.Durham's family is now demanding answers. His daughter, Isabella, spoke out in a press conference, saying, ""He called the police for safety, and instead, he was brutally murdered."" Durham's mother also expressed grief, asking, ""Someone needs to explain to me why my son is not here with us today.""Officer Bookman has been placed on paid administrative leave while the Las Vegas Metro Police Department investigates whether his use of force was justified. The investigation could take between 30 to 90 days, according to Clark County district attorney Steve Wolfson.Experts are raising concerns about the officer's actions. Felipe Rodriguez, an adjunct professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and former NYPD detective, stressed that police officers must be able to justify their use of force, particularly when multiple shots are fired after a suspect is down.Meanwhile, Boudreaux has been arrested and faces several charges, including home invasion with a deadly weapon, assault with a deadly weapon, and child abuse.Police reports indicate that Boudreaux and Durham were known to each other and had a sexual relationship. Boudreaux reportedly told detectives that she intended to provoke police into killing her during the home invasion. She has since refused to attend two court hearings.","Brandon Durham, 43, called 911 to report a potential home invasion in Las Vegas, Nevada.

He also decried the “enforced disappearances, brutality, and violence” against PTI workers.Khan’s statement followed his wife Bushra Bibi’s recent warning to PTI politicians about tickets for the next general election. “The party tickets for the next general elections are linked with the performance of the PTI leadership during the upcoming protest in Islamabad,” she said, describing it as Imran’s message to the party leadership.On Monday, PTI had announced it would not end its sit-in until its stolen mandate was returned, the constitution restored, and Imran set free.","Khan urges everyone to join the protest on November 24. “The nation will not accept any excuse at such a critical time,” he said.

As a result, authorities continue to stress the importance of polio vaccination campaigns to prevent the spread of the virus, especially in high-risk areas. International organizations have also urged Pakistan to implement emergency measures to prevent the spread of the virus.Health authorities announced on November 14 that the case detected in Jaffarabad, Balochistan, marked the district's first confirmed polio infection, highlighting the continued spread of the virus across the country.Genetic sequencing of the virus sample, carried out by the Regional Reference Laboratory for Polio Eradication at the National Institute of Health (NIH) in Islamabad, has traced the virus to a WPV1 strain that was previously identified in Pishin, Balochistan, in April. This connection highlights active transmission within the province, which remains the hardest-hit area, with 24 cases reported till now.Besides Afghanistan, Pakistan remains the only country where wild poliovirus transmission has yet to be eradicated. The continued spread of the virus is largely attributed to challenges such as insecurity, misinformation, and community resistance, all of which hinder vaccination efforts.Polio affects the nervous system, often resulting in paralysis or even death.

This indictment followed several breaches relating to the riots that took place on May 9, 2023.During a hearing at Kot Lakhpat Jail on Monday, Qureshi labeled these charges as baseless and politically motivated. He argued that the cases were framed to target and suppress the leadership of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), whose leader Imran Khan is also in jail currently.The senior party leaders who were indicted include PTI's Punjab president Dr. Yasmin Rashid, Senator Ejaz Chaudhry, former Punjab governor Omar Sarfraz Cheema, former provincial minister Mian Mahmoodur Rasheed, ex-lawmakers Aliya Hamza and Rubina Jamil, along with social media activist Sanam Javed.The session was led by Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) judge Manzer Ali Khan.

Extortions bleed Pak’s terror-stalked northwest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/extortions-bleed-paks-terror-stalked-northwest/articleshow/115454371.cms,"TOI

ISLAMABAD: Surging terror and extortions have endangered public safety in Pakistan ’s restive northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where militants in several districts run a parallel shadow administration.The southern districts of the province have almost become no-go areas even for law-enforcers. In the evening, militants are seen patrolling the streets and setting up checkpoints in Bannu, North and South Waziristan, Tank, Lakki Marwat, and Dera Ismail Khan regions.While these districts remain at mercy of militants from evening to morning, well-off people in other districts of the province frequently receive threatening WhatsApp texts and letters from Pakistani Taliban -- or Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) -- with demands to pay or face attacks. The ones who refuse to pay ransom are often targeted with grenade attacks at their homes, shops and warehouses, apparently to show the group was serious about its threats.Faisal Khan, a lawyer in Umerzai area in Charsadda district, toldthat he had received a threatening WhatsApp text earlier this month from an Afghanistan number with a demand to pay $50,000 (Pak Rs 1.4cr).Khan claims that after reporting the threats to the police, he went to high-ranking officers to request protection and assistance. Most official discussions, he said, concluded with cautious assurances.“A family goes through pain for months after such a call. Even after approaching the cops, the victims are normally asked to install CCTV cameras, restrict movement and take care of security themselves,” Khan said. He also revealed that he was cautioned by “allies in the govt” that he “should not count” on them to keep him safe. “Either pay up or move your family to Islamabad or Lahore,” he said in reference to a private communication with some officials after he pressed for assistance.Last week, Khan said he had received a parcel carrying a shroud and other items required before burials. “This was followed by a threatening message to vacate my home within 30 minutes,” Khan said, adding he has refused to pay the extortioners.However, Shahzaib, another person in the same neighbourhood who had received a similar text on TTP’s letterhead last month, has paid after negotiating a deal through intermediaries. He eventually paid a reduced part of the $50,000 the militants initially demanded.“The key thing I learnt was that TTP is demanding extortion from everyone they think can pay. Most, if not all, wealthy individuals have already paid,” Shahzaib said.According to police, the main hurdle for law-enforcers in tracking down extortionists is the calls which they make from non-local lines, internet-generated resources, illegal gateways and Whatsapp numbers.Apart from various groups, the police said, criminal rings are also found involved in many such calls. In the last two years, police sources said at least 1,600 Afghan phone numbers and 387 illegal gateways were used for making extortion calls. These numbers and illegal gateways, according to the police, have been shared with higher authorities for follow-up action. “Despite the alarming increase in Taliban extortion demands, the issue has yet to attract national attention,” a senior police official said.","The southern districts of the province have almost become no-go areas even for law-enforcers.

Eight soldiers were killed and seven police officers abducted in separate incidents in northwest Pakistan on Tuesday, officials told news agency AFP. The Pakistani Taliban has claimed responsibility for the assaults.The first attack occurred on Monday, where a clash between security forces and militants left ""eight soldiers"" and ""nine militants"" dead, according to an intelligence official who spoke anonymously.In a separate incident, seven police officers were abducted, a senior police official confirmed.These incidents follow a series of recent militant operations in Pakistan. Just last week, seven paramilitary soldiers were killed in an attack by Baloch separatists on a border post in Balochistan province . The same group, the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), was responsible for a deadly railway station bombing earlier this year that killed 26 people, including 14 soldiers.Militant groups like the BLA and the Pakistani Taliban frequently target security forces and infrastructure, claiming to fight for autonomy or ideological goals. Their activities have disrupted economic projects, particularly those involving foreign investment, such as Chinese-backed ventures in Balochistan.Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has condemned these attacks, vowing swift action against the perpetrators.","Pakistani Taliban claims responsibility for two attacks in northwest Pakistan.

Crisis in PoJK: Deforestation devastates environment and livelihoods,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/crisis-in-pojk-deforestation-devastates-environment-and-livelihoods/articleshow/115412646.cms,"Representative Image

CHINARI: In Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK), an alarming environmental crisis is rapidly unfolding. Once home to vast, lush forests, this region has seen its green cover decimated over the past several decades.The rapid deforestation, particularly in areas like Chinari, has only exacerbated the crisis. As the forests vanish, so does the natural filtration system that once regulated air quality and helped prevent erosion, leaving the land more vulnerable to environmental degradation.Arshad Rasheed, a local resident, shared a stark reminder of the dramatic change.""In this region, 75 per cent of the land was once covered by forests, but today that figure has dropped to around 10 per cent. Before 1947, the region's economy was heavily dependent on forest resources. After the region became part of PoJK, large-scale deforestation began, and the forest cover has been reduced from 75 per cent to just 10 per cent today"", he said.The consequences of this widespread deforestation are most severely felt by the local communities who once depended on the forests for their livelihoods.In Chinari, vast amounts of wood, remnants of the once-thriving forests, now lie rotting on the ground, untouched for decades.While the government has imposed a ban on cutting trees in an effort to preserve the remaining forest cover, this policy has inadvertently worsened the plight of local residents, many of whom are already struggling with poverty.Arshad explained the dilemma thus faced, noting, ""People living near the forests need fuel for cooking and heating, but the government has made no provision to address this need. While the ban on cutting trees was intended to protect the remaining forests, it ignores the fact that people depend on these resources for their daily survival. Today, locals are prohibited from cutting their own trees, yet their fuel needs are not being met by the government"".For the people of Chinari and other parts of PoJK, the issue is no longer just about conserving the environment. It has become a fight for survival in a landscape that has been stripped of the resources they once relied on.With the forests gone and no viable alternatives in place, their future looks increasingly uncertain, as they face both environmental collapse and a lack of basic resources.","In Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK), an alarming environmental crisis is rapidly unfolding.

"Amid Net censorship, Pakistan offers regulated VPNs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/amid-net-censorship-pakistan-offers-regulated-vpns/articleshow/115392568.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Amid a ban on unregistered virtual private networks (VPNs) across Pakistan — allegedly aimed at preventing their use by militant groups for financial transactions and violent activities — Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) has launched a registration process for companies and freelancers to use their VPNs.The nationwide ban, imposed on interior ministry’s direction on Friday, has been widely viewed by observers and critics as a joint attempt by the govt and military to silence dissenting voices.Media sources have also suggested that the slowdown in internet speeds across Pakistan is linked to the govt’s installation of a national firewall. The firewall was deployed as Pakistani military faced severe online criticism for its alleged role in keeping former PM Imran Khan behind bars, while his party, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, continued to face a harsh crackdown. The military, which denies interference in politics, has recently begun using the term ""digital terrorists"" to describe online critics.VPN usage has surged in Pakistan as users seek access to X (formerly Twitter), a platform blocked since February, along with numerous other websites. Authorities also claim that VPN software is being used to bypass restrictions on pornographic content.PTA said it had streamlined the VPN registration process for organizations and freelancers. Entities such as software houses, call centres, banks, embassies, and freelancers can now register their VPNs online through the PTA’s official website. The registration process is divided into four distinct categories: companies, freelancers, call centres, and video conferencing.""To date, more than 20,000 companies and freelancers have successfully registered their VPNs through this efficient process,"" PTA said in a statement on Saturday.According to PTA, the registration process involves completing an online form and providing basic details, including the national identity card number, company registration details, and taxpayer status. Freelancers must also submit proof of their association with a project or company, such as a letter or email confirmation.Also, applicants will need to provide an IP address for VPN connectivity. A fixed IP address can be obtained through internet service providers.After interior ministry circulated its letter calling for the VPN ban, Council of Islamic Ideology, a constitutional advisory body tasked with ensuring laws align with Islamic principles, declared VPN usage to be ""un-Islamic"" in a statement issued the same day.“The government and the state have the authority, from an Islamic perspective, to prevent all actions that lead to wrongdoing or facilitate it,” council’s chairman, Raghib Hussain Naeemi, was quoted as saying. ""Therefore, measures to block or restrict access to immoral and offensive content, including the banning of VPNs, are in accordance with Shariah.”","Pakistan Telecommunication Authority has launched a registration process for companies and freelancers to use their VPNs.

According to police, her body was dismembered into dozens of pieces and dumped in a drain in Punjab province.The crime occurred last week in Daska, Sialkot district, which is approximately 100 km from Lahore.A murder case has been filed against the suspects, and four individuals have been arrested in connection with the crime. The arrested include the mother-in-law, Sughran Bibi; her daughter, Yasmin; her grandson, Hamza; and a distant relative, Navid.Senior police officer Omar Farooq informed reporters that the suspects have confessed to killing Zara and dismembering her body.Zara Qadir, a woman in her 20s, went missing last week, and later, police discovered her dismembered body in three sacks, which was identified as hers.Zara, who was the daughter of a police officer, had married Qadir Ahmad four years ago, and they had a three-year-old son. She went to Saudi Arabia after her marriage and returned to Pakistan only a few months ago.Farooq said, ""In her confessional statement, Sughran Bibi said that she suspected Zara of allegedly practicing 'witchcraft,' and besides, her son Qadir had started sending money directly to Zara's bank account instead of to his mother.""He added that the four suspects smothered the pregnant Zara with a pillow while she was asleep and then proceeded to burn her face. Then, they dismembered her body into dozens of pieces before dumping it in a drain in three sacks.""Based on Zara's father's statement, where he suspected Sughran after she claimed Zara had run away with her lover upon her disappearance, we interrogated Sughran, who confessed to her crime,"" Farooq said.He mentioned that Sughran was also Zara's paternal aunt.Farooq stated that this was a case of extreme jealousy, as the mother-in-law and her daughter not only killed Zara but also dismembered her body out of hatred.

The crisis has particularly affected Pakistan's Punjab province, where smog and hazardous air quality levels have created a public health emergency.Hospitals across Punjab have been overwhelmed, with Lahore recording the highest number of cases. Toxic smog forced over 75,000 people to seek medical help on a single day, further straining the healthcare system. Over the past month, Lahore alone reported 133,429 respiratory disease cases, including 5,577 asthma patients. Additionally, 5,455 of the 13,862 heart disease cases and 491 of the 5,141 stroke cases in the province were treated in Lahore. The crisis escalated in the past week, with 449,045 respiratory cases reported, along with 30,146 asthma cases, 2,225 heart disease patients, and 1,400 stroke victims.The government has taken several emergency measures, including closing schools, colleges, and parks, limiting market hours, and imposing bans on polluting vehicles and industrial activities. Despite these steps, air quality in cities like Lahore and Multan continues to deteriorate. Lahore’s Air Quality Index (AQI) consistently exceeds hazardous levels, often surpassing 1,000, while Multan recently recorded an alarming AQI of over 2,000.Residents are struggling to cope with the smog’s health impacts. For many, staying indoors offers little relief, and air purifiers remain unaffordable luxuries. Public and private schools have been ordered to close until November 24, with authorities also enforcing a three-day lockdown in Lahore and Multan to mitigate pollution. However, these measures have brought limited respite.Healthcare workers are stretched to their limits. Doctors report a significant increase in patients, particularly children and the elderly, suffering from breathing difficulties, coughing fits, and eye irritation. “This year, smog levels are much worse, and the number of affected patients is far greater,” said Dr Qurat ul Ain, a medical practitioner in Lahore. She advises residents to wear masks and avoid outdoor exposure.The smog’s primary causes include industrial emissions, vehicle exhaust, and seasonal agricultural stubble burning, exacerbated by stagnant weather conditions. Climate activist Alia Haider described the city as “stuck in its own poison” and criticised the lack of effective long-term solutions. As smog continues to blanket Pakistan’s major cities, millions remain at risk, awaiting meaningful action to address the worsening environmental crisis.","Over 1.91 million people with respiratory illnesses have been admitted to government hospitals in Pakistan over the past month.

While it has revolutionised access to information, it has also facilitated the proliferation of disinformation and hate speech. He warned that without robust laws to regulate online content, the consequences could be dire.“False and misleading information poses a major challenge. Without comprehensive laws, hate speech and misinformation will continue to destabilise societies,” he said.The general’s comments come as Pakistan grapples with increasing misuse of social media platforms.

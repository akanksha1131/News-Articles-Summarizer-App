Overriding Biden-era rules: US Supreme Court backs Trump admin's passport gender policy — what it means,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-supreme-court-allows-trump-to-restrict-passport-gender-marker-changes-for-trans-and-non-binary-people-what-it-means/articleshow/125147714.cms,"Donald Trump’s Trade Weapon Tested: US Supreme Court Weighs Limits of Emergency Powers, Authority

Sex markers on passports and changes to gender marker policies during Biden reign





What it means for transgender?









The Supreme Court on Thursday allowed US President Donald Trump’s administration to enforce a policy blocking transgender and nonbinary people from choosing passport sex markers that aligned with their gender identity.The decision, issued on the court’s emergency docket, permits the policy to remain in effect while a lawsuit over it proceeds.A lower-court order had required the government to continue letting applicants select male, female, or X on new or renewed passports to correspond with their gender identity. The Supreme Court’s three liberal justices dissented from the unsigned, conservative-majority order, AP news agency reported.“Displaying passport holders’ sex at birth no more offends equal protection principles than displaying their country of birth,” the unsigned order stated. “In both cases, the government is merely attesting to a historical fact without subjecting anyone to differential treatment.”In dissent, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said the policy made transgender people vulnerable to “increased violence, harassment, and discrimination”.She added, “This court has once again paved the way for the immediate infliction of injury without adequate (or, really, any) justification,” and noted the policy derived directly from Trump’s executive order that described transgender identity as “false” and “corrosive”.The Supreme Court majority held that preventing enforcement of the policy would harm the govt because passports fall within foreign affairs, a domain of executive-branch control. The dissenting justices countered that it was unclear how individual identification documents affected national foreign policy.The State Department altered its passport rules after Trump issued an executive order in January declaring the United States would “recognise two sexes, male and female” based on birth certificates and “biological classification”.Sex markers began appearing on passports in the mid-1970s and the federal govt started allowing them to be changed with medical documentation in the early 1990s, the plaintiffs said in court documents.A 2021 change under then-President Joe Biden, a Democrat, removed documentation requirements and allowed nonbinary people to choose an X gender marker after years of litigation.A judge blocked the Trump administration policy in June after a lawsuit from nonbinary and transgender people, some of whom said they were afraid to submit applications.An appeals court left the judge’s order in place. Solicitor General D John Sauer then turned to the Supreme Court, pointing to its recent ruling upholding a ban on transition-related healthcare for transgender minors and calling the Biden-era policy inaccurate.The plaintiffs, who challenged the policy, argue these passports are inaccurate and can be unsafe for those whose gender expression does not match the documents.“Forcing transgender people to carry passports that out them against their will increases the risk that they will face harassment and violence,” Jon Davidson, senior counsel for the ACLU’s LGBTQ and HIV Project, said.“This is a heartbreaking setback for the freedom of all people to be themselves, and fuel on the fire the Trump administration is stoking against transgender people and their constitutional rights.”Transgender actor Hunter Schafer said in February that her new passport had been issued with a male gender marker, despite her having been marked female on her driver’s licence and previous passports.","US President Donald Trump’s administration can enforce a policy blocking transgender and nonbinary people from choosing passport sex markers that aligned with their gender identity.

Irish police got a call about a lion. It was actually a dog named mouse,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/irish-police-got-a-call-about-a-lion-it-was-actually-a-dog-named-mouse/articleshow/125147743.cms,"



John O'Reilly, a forest manager in western Ireland, could hardly believe his eyes when he saw the grainy video on his phone, sent to him by a truck driver. There, slinking through the woodlands of County Clare, in Ireland, was the impossible: A stocky, tan-coloured animal with a shaggy mane and tufted tail, lumbering into the trees and then out of view.""You're saying, 'Christ, that couldn't be what it looks like,'"" O'Reilly recalled. A lion? The video began spreading on news sites and social media in Ireland, prompting both speculation and scepticism.After nearly a week, Ireland's police force, known as An Garda Siochana, solved the confounding case. The creature was no apex predator. It was a shaggy Newfoundland dog. Its name? Mouse.""Gardai from Killaloe have concluded that the recent video of a 'lion like' animal roaming around the woods in East Clare is in fact the very friendly dog named 'Mouse',"" police said in a post on social platform X, along with photos of a calm, docile dog, whose shaved fur resembled a lion's mane and tail.Despite the proximity to Halloween, it's still unclear why Mouse had been groomed to look like a lion. Veterinary doctors do not recommend shaving water dogs like Newfoundlands, whose coats protect them from the elements.It is the amusing end to a saga that O'Reilly said began weeks ago, when construction crews and workers in the East Clare area noticed a large animal moving among the trees. They assumed it was a deer or a trick of the light, he said.And then came that video, from the truck driver. O'Reilly, who runs a private forest-management company in neighbouring County Meath, said he decided to report the video to the Gardai because of safety concerns. Police, as perplexed as anyone at the apparent sight of a lion in Ireland, initially asked O'Reilly if it could have been made with artificial intelligence, he said.The video could've been ""everything from a dog, to a wannabe Al Pacino in Scarface keeping an animal in the woods to protect his grow house,"" O'Reilly said of the possibilities he considered - adding that it wouldn't be the first time an exotic animal was found roaming the island.It wouldn't even be the first lion - in a 1951 incident that is now island lore, a lioness escaped from a lion tamer's home in Dublin, where it was once legal to keep the large cats. The lioness mauled a city teenager before being shot by police.Lions have not inhabited the European continent in thousands of years. But the Irish, ironically, once cultivated a reputation for breeding the captive wildcats, which were marquee items of many circuses and shows in the mid-century. The famed MGM lion, with his luxurious mane, bore the Irish name Cairbre and was born at the Dublin zoo.","A truck driver sent a grainy video to a forest manager in western Ireland.

Pelosi’s Viral ‘No Kings’ Crown-Smashing Act Triggers Uproar Across Political Circles





SAN FRANCISCO: Rep. Nancy Pelosi announced Thursday that she will retire when her term concludes in early 2027, ending a remarkable career in which she rose to become one of the most powerful women in American history.Pelosi, 85, was the nation's first and only female House speaker, and she will have represented San Francisco in Congress for 39 years when she leaves office. She has served during an era of seismic change for American society and her own city, from the throes of the AIDS crisis to the legalization of same-sex marriage, and through the meteoric rise of the tech sector and the nation's extreme polarization.She entered political office later in life and became a hero to Democrats for the way she wielded immense power to push the Affordable Care Act, climate change legislation and infrastructure programs through Congress.""With a grateful heart, I look forward to my final year of service as your proud representative,"" she told her constituents in a nearly six-minute video posted on X early Thursday, with clips of San Francisco's iconic cable cars and colorful Victorian homes flashing in the background.""My message to the city I love is this: San Francisco, know your power,"" she continued. ""We have always led the way, and now we must continue to do so by remaining full participants in our democracy and fighting for the American ideals we hold dear.""Pelosi, who likes to use the phrase ""resting is rusting,"" led the House Democrats for 20 years, eight of which she spent as speaker. She has also been a prodigious fundraiser and raised more than $1.3 billion for Democratic campaigns, according to her aides.But she was reviled by conservatives, who painted her as the scary embodiment of liberal San Francisco values and blamed her for what they considered the nation's decline.She has been a chief irritant to President Donald Trump, even to this day, calling him ""a vile creature"" in a CNN interview that aired this week. She presided over two of his impeachment votes in the House. And he has called her ""Crazy Nancy,"" with no sense of fondness for his foe.Her Democratic colleagues said she was unlike any other politician with whom they had worked. Jackie Speier, a Bay Area Democrat who served in the House for 15 years, said that Pelosi would go down in history ""as the most consequential speaker ever.""""She has a command, a presence. All eyes turn to her,"" Speier said.Her retirement had been grist for the local and national political rumor mill for several years, and younger Democrats grew increasingly eager to run for her seat. They feared, however, that it would be folly to challenge one of the most powerful politicians in modern history.Pelosi, for her part, told CNN days ago that she had no doubt she would win reelection if she were to run for another term.Still, the overwhelming defeat Democrats suffered last year in the congressional and presidential races has prompted soul-searching within the party -- and louder calls for older Democrats to step down and make way for new politicians with fresh ideas.The race to succeed Pelosi was already shaping up to be a fierce one before she announced her retirement. Scott Wiener, a Democratic state senator from San Francisco who is a champion of housing construction, and Saikat Chakrabarti, who worked as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's chief of staff, have already announced they were running for the seat -- with or without Pelosi on the ballot.In recent months, Pelosi has refused to discuss her career plans, insisting she was focused solely on the passage of California's Proposition 50, a ballot measure to approve newly drawn House districts. She worked behind the scenes to help Gov. Gavin Newsom craft the measure, which passed Tuesday, and to raise money for the effort.It was considered one of her final achievements, both a blow to Trump, who had sought more Republican seats in the House by gerrymandering in conservative states, and a parting gift to the next generation of California Democrats who could benefit from as many as five additional seats in the state.Trump still has strong contempt for Pelosi.""The retirement of Nancy Pelosi is a great thing for America,"" he said Thursday in a response to Fox News. ""She was evil, corrupt and only focused on bad things for our country.""At a packed union hall in San Francisco on Monday morning, Pelosi was the emcee for a Proposition 50 rally that included Newsom and labor leader Dolores Huerta.""This is a moment of truth for America,"" Pelosi told the crowd. ""It's self-defense for our democracy.""In the audience, union workers wore T-shirts that Pelosi had autographed for them and pins with drawings of six tiny Nancy Pelosis standing side by side, each wearing a suit in a different color of the rainbow.At the rally, the ever-stylish Pelosi was sporting a green corduroy suit and green stilettos, never mind the fall she took in December on a marble staircase in Luxembourg that forced her to get a hip replacement and remain stuck for several months in dreaded flats.Pelosi's career in elected office has been a long one, but it did not span even half her life. Born into a politically powerful family of Democrats in Baltimore -- her father and brother each served as the city's mayor -- Pelosi went the more traditional route for women of her age.At first, anyway.She met her husband, Paul Pelosi, at Georgetown University, and the couple moved to his hometown, San Francisco, where she stayed home to raise their five children. During that time, Pelosi grew his career as a venture capitalist.As a young mother, Nancy Pelosi found a way to support the Democratic Party by opening up the family's large home for fundraisers. That led to friendships with a host of prominent San Francisco Democrats in the 1970s and 1980s, including Willie Brown, Jerry Brown and Phil and John Burton, brothers who served in Congress.Her connections and fundraising prowess helped her get elected as the first woman to chair the California Democratic Party.When Rep. Phil Burton died in office, his wife, Sala Burton, replaced him. Sala Burton was soon after diagnosed with cancer and told Pelosi she wanted her to run for the seat. Pelosi, who had shrugged off other suggestions to run for elected office, finally agreed.A special election was held in June 1987, and Pelosi, then 47, edged out Harry Britt, a gay socialist who had worked as an aide to Harvey Milk, the San Francisco supervisor who was assassinated at City Hall in 1978.Cleve Jones, who also worked for Milk and who created the AIDS Memorial Quilt, had backed Britt. Jones recalled in an interview that he initially had dismissed Pelosi as ""a society lady.""""I had the most wrong first impression of Nancy Pelosi,"" he said. ""I just didn't take her very seriously.""But he said his view changed when Pelosi used her first floor speech in the House to talk about the AIDS crisis as the Reagan administration largely ignored it. That same year, she helped Jones get his quilt installed on the National Mall in Washington.In 1990, she fought for the passage of an act named after Ryan White , a teenager who contracted HIV from a blood transfusion and was banned from his school after his diagnosis. The program paid for health care for HIV/AIDS patients who lacked medical coverage.""She's just always been there,"" Jones said. ""She's more than an ally. She's family.""Barbara Boxer, who represented a different part of San Francisco in the House and later became a U.S. senator, said in an interview that she and Pelosi were constantly confused for each other and lumped together as ""the two women from San Francisco.""They bonded by sitting next to each other during countless flights home. Boxer praised her friend's unique combination of her social justice values, driven by her Catholic faith, and her tactical ability to know every facet of every bill and exactly where each member stood on it.Together, they persuaded the federal government to dump a plan to turn San Francisco's military base, the Presidio, into condominiums. Instead, the government preserved it as a national park.Karen Bass, the mayor of Los Angeles who served in Congress alongside Pelosi, said her colleague was a ""masterful leader"" who listened to widespread dissent in her caucus, but used her smarts and persuasion to repeatedly corral them and win key votes.""I was in awe watching her,"" she said.Pelosi's rise -- and her wins on Capitol Hill -- made her a regular target for conservatives. During the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, some rioters made a beeline for her office, tore down her wooden nameplate and broke into her chambers. One man, who was later prosecuted, was seen sitting in her chair with his feet propped up on her desk in a display of defiance.The next year, in October 2022, her husband was brutally attacked in the Pelosi home by a man living in the Bay Area who seemed obsessed with right-wing conspiracy theories.On Monday, however, Paul Pelosi was at the union hall with his wife, appearing healthy.At the Proposition 50 rally, Newsom thanked Nancy Pelosi for her work on the ballot measure.""Some people go off and they talk about the way the world should be, but they don't do anything to damn manifest it,"" he said. ""Nancy Pelosi doesn't go out to try to make points. She makes a difference.""Pelosi stood behind him, beaming. Then, she exited the stage.","Pelosi, 85, was the nation's first and only female House speaker. She will have represented San Francisco in Congress for 39 years when she leaves office. She has served during an era of seismic change for American society and her own city. She became a hero to Democrats for the way she wielded immense power.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125147678,imgsize-70868,width-400,resizemode-4/pelosi-plans-to-retire-in-2027-after-39-years-in-congress.jpg"

Integration of operations and engineering control centres





Real time monitoring and proactive management





Connection with the enterprise command and control centre (EC3)





Advancing smart urban mobility









Dubai’s Metro network has taken a decisive step towards smarter, faster, and safer urban mobility. By integrating its Operations Control Centre with the Engineering Control Centre, the city’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has created a unified platform that transforms fault response, operational efficiency, and real-time oversight across the transport system. This development marks a key milestone in Dubai’s Strategic Plan 2030, signalling a new era for sustainable and innovative public transport.The RTA, through its Rail Agency, has formally linked the Operations Control Centre (OCC) with the Engineering Control Centre (ECC). This integration is designed to increase operational flexibility, improve response times, and ensure a smoother passenger experience throughout the Dubai Metro network.Hasan Al Mutawa, Director of Rail Operations at RTA’s Rail Agency, emphasised the significance of the move: “The integration of the Operations and Engineering Control Centres marks a significant leap in performance. Fault notifications are now transmitted in real time, enabling quicker deployment of first response teams and accelerating service recovery by up to 80 per cent.”This initiative streamlines operational procedures, enhances flexibility, and allows the Metro network to respond more dynamically to disruptions or technical issues.The integration brings live data dashboards that provide comprehensive visibility over both operational and technical systems. Early warning signals now allow for the proactive identification of potential risks, while unified data improves the speed and accuracy of decision-making.Internal communication has been strengthened, ensuring that updates reach relevant personnel promptly, and passengers receive timely information during service interruptions. The system’s design ensures that critical situations can be handled with precision, reducing downtime and improving overall reliability.Beyond the Metro network, the integrated platform connects directly with Dubai’s Enterprise Command and Control Centre (EC3). This linkage enables real-time monitoring across the city’s entire transport ecosystem and allows urgent matters to escalate immediately when necessary.Al Mutawa highlighted that the integration process included coordinated staff training and unified communication procedures with partner agencies, reinforcing Dubai Metro’s role as the backbone of the city’s public transport system.The RTA describes this transformation as a pivotal step towards Dubai’s vision for the future of urban mobility. By combining technical and operational oversight under a single framework, the authority is promoting smarter, more agile practices while enhancing safety, innovation, and efficiency.This milestone positions Dubai as a global model for sustainable and intelligent public transport, advancing the city’s Strategic Plan 2030 goal of providing innovative systems that deliver world-class customer experiences.","Dubai Metro has taken a decisive step towards smarter, faster, and safer urban mobility.

HISTORIC: Zohran Mamdani Elected New York City's First Indian-American Muslim Mayor

Maya Handa: The architect behind Zohran Mamdani’s historic mayoral victory



Steering Mamdani’s campaign





When Zohran Mamdani made history by securing the mayoralty of New York City, one name was inevitably linked to his victory: Maya Handa. Appointed as Mamdani’s campaign manager in July 2025, Handa played a pivotal role in orchestrating the campaign that saw Mamdani defeat heavyweights such as former governor Andrew Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa.The 34-year-old Democrat and state assembly member from Queens became the city’s first South Asian and Muslim mayor, winning more than 50% of the vote in a contest that drew record participation. According to official figures, over two million New Yorkers cast ballots, nearly double the turnout from four years ago and the highest in more than five decades. Mamdani maintained a lead of around nine percentage points over Cuomo, who finished with just over 40%, while Sliwa trailed slightly above 7%. Voter engagement surged across Brooklyn, Queens, and Manhattan, reaching near presidential-election levels.Handa, a seasoned political strategist with deep roots in progressive organising, turned Mamdani’s underdog campaign into a citywide force that cut across class and community lines. Working largely behind the scenes, she used her sharp political instincts to refine and amplify Mamdani’s message, one centred on economic fairness, affordable living, and social justice, ensuring it reached and resonated with New Yorkers from every borough.Maya Handa’s rise as a political strategist culminated in her appointment as Zohran Mamdani’s campaign manager for his historic bid to become New York City’s first Muslim mayor. A seasoned political organiser with a deep commitment to progressive causes, Handa’s background has made her an invaluable asset in Mamdani’s pursuit of the mayoralty.Appointed to lead the campaign in July 2025, Handa replaced Elle Bisgaard-Church, who had served as Mamdani’s chief of staff and led his primary campaign. Her appointment marked a decisive shift in the campaign’s leadership structure. As Bisgaard-Church transitioned to serve as Mamdani’s chief adviser, Handa took over day-to-day campaign management, joining alongside Afua Atta-Mensah, who became political director, and Deandra Khan, director of labour and intergovernmental affairs.Handa’s résumé reads like a map of the modern progressive movement in the United States. She has worked on Senator Elizabeth Warren’s presidential campaign, Representative Mondaire Jones’ congressional run, and India Walton’s mayoral bid in Buffalo. She also managed Nida Allam’s campaign for North Carolina’s 4th congressional district and has collaborated with the influential Working Families Party, a central player in New York’s left-leaning political landscape.In addition to these national roles, Handa has worked with prominent local officials including Queens Assemblymember Claire Valdez and Brooklyn Councilmember Shahana Hanif, both noted advocates for social justice and inclusivity. Some of these roles were not formally listed on her public profile, but multiple reports, including those by The New York Times and CNN, have documented her deep involvement in community-centred politics.When Mamdani entered the mayoral race last year, few expected him to challenge, let alone defeat, political heavyweights like Cuomo and Sliwa. He had minimal name recognition, limited funding, and very little institutional party backing. Handa’s strategic arrival transformed those significant disadvantages into a disciplined, grassroots-driven strategy.Drawing on her extensive campaign experience, Handa reoriented Mamdani’s operation around ground-level outreach, emphasising neighbourhood canvassing, precise messaging, and inclusive communication. She prioritised genuine voter connection over traditional, advertising-heavy tactics, shaping a clear narrative around economic fairness, rent freezes, and affordable childcare.Her focus on authenticity rather than polish helped Mamdani build trust across the city, resonating with working-class families in Brownsville as much as with younger professionals in Manhattan.Handa also helped strengthen the campaign’s coalition. She brought in new advisers and operational leads, including Atta-Mensah, whose role focused on expanding Black voter outreach, and Mr Lerner, a seasoned Washington operative who took charge of communications after the primary. Together, they built a tightly coordinated and disciplined campaign that remained true to Mamdani’s grassroots message while expanding its reach across the city. And though Mamdani was the public face of the movement, it was Handa who quietly engineered its success.","Maya Handa, 34, was appointed as Zohran Mamdani’s campaign manager in July 2025. She played a pivotal role in orchestrating the campaign that saw him defeat heavyweights such as former governor Andrew Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa. The 34-year-old Democrat and state assembly member from Queens won more than 50% of the vote.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125132168,imgsize-670761,width-400,resizemode-4/maya-handa.jpg"
UAE gaming authority announces interim CEO appointment after Kevin Mullally steps down,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-gaming-authority-announces-interim-ceo-appointment-after-kevin-mullally-steps-down/articleshow/125131787.cms,"Kevin Mullally exits as UAE GCGRA CEO, leaving a strong regulatory framework; Jim Murren becomes interim CEO/Image: X

A seamless transition at the helm





The architect of a new regulatory framework





A personal departure, not a professional goodbye





A regulator built for the long term





Looking ahead









The quiet corridors of Abu Dhabi’s newest federal regulator are witnessing a moment of change. Kevin Mullally, the man who helped design the foundations of the UAE’s General Commercial Gaming Regulatory Authority (GCGRA), has stepped down as its Chief Executive Officer for personal reasons. His departure and the appointment of Chairman Jim Murren as interim CEO come as the Authority moves from its formative stage into a period of operational maturity, a transition that reflects both continuity and confidence.The announcement was made by the GCGRA, confirming that the leadership handover takes effect immediately. Murren, who also chairs the Authority’s board, will temporarily steer the organisation while the Executive Leadership Team maintains the rhythm of daily operations.In a statement, Murren underscored Mullally’s role in shaping the Authority’s early development:“Kevin has played a significant role in the Authority’s early development, helping to establish its core governance and regulatory structure. We thank him for his contribution and wish him continued success in his future endeavours.”The regulator was quick to assure stakeholders that its programmes, licensing activities, and external engagements will proceed without interruption, emphasising the institution’s stability as it continues to refine its regulatory reach across the UAE’s evolving gaming landscape.For much of his tenure, Mullally stood at the intersection of policy, regulation, and innovation. A veteran of over four decades in gaming oversight, his career has spanned law enforcement, policy development, and consultancy to governments worldwide. Before joining the UAE regulator, he led the Missouri Gaming Commission and served as an executive at Gaming Laboratories International (GLI), roles that cemented his reputation as a principled and pragmatic regulator.In Abu Dhabi, Mullally’s mandate was ambitious. He was tasked with creating the UAE’s first unified commercial gaming regulatory framework grounded in integrity, consumer protection, and international best practice. The Authority now regulates a spectrum of activities across five licence categories: lottery, land-based gaming facilities, gaming-related vendors, internet gaming, and sports wagering.Under his guidance, the GCGRA established what he described as “an efficient, modern regulatory framework that upholds the highest standards of integrity and consumer protection while encouraging and enabling innovative gaming technology.” He often spoke of the UAE’s potential to model responsible, transparent regulation in a rapidly globalising gaming industry.In a note posted on LinkedIn, Mullally cited family reasons for stepping down, explaining that he would return to the United States to spend time with his wife, “five children, their spouses, and our eight grandchildren.”He described leading the Authority as “one of the greatest professional honours” of his career and praised his colleagues for their “dedication, expertise, and commitment to public service.” Mullally added that the organisation was now well-positioned for the next phase of its development, promising continued support through the transition.Those who have worked alongside him describe a measured leader who built systems quietly but firmly, ensuring that the GCGRA’s credibility would rest not on ambition alone but on structure and integrity.Headquartered in Abu Dhabi, the GCGRA operates as an independent executive entity under federal law with exclusive jurisdiction to oversee and license all commercial gaming activities in the UAE. Its remit spans regulation, compliance, and supervision of gaming operators and vendors, alongside enforcing standards in responsible gaming and financial crime prevention.The Authority’s team includes specialists from across the globe, experts in technology, law enforcement, policy, and financial regulation, reflecting the UAE’s stated goal of building an institution aligned with global oversight norms.As Murren steps into the interim role, his focus will be on steering the Authority through its next stage, moving from framework to full-scale implementation. “The GCGRA remains focused on the next stage of its growth,” he said, “ensuring regulatory excellence, responsible gaming, and continued confidence in the UAE’s approach.”Mullally’s exit marks more than a change in leadership. It signals a new chapter for a regulator still defining its place in a complex, globally scrutinised industry. The foundation he leaves behind, built on transparency, integrity, and operational rigour, provides the scaffolding for what comes next.With Murren’s interim leadership and an established executive team, the GCGRA now moves forward on steady ground, its early architect stepping aside but leaving behind a blueprint designed for endurance.","Kevin Mullally has stepped down as CEO of the UAE's General Commercial Gaming Regulatory Authority.

US Airport Shutdown: US losing $15bn each week; 40 airports to be closed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/shutdown-crisis-deepens-us-losing-15bn-each-week-40-airports-to-be-closed/articleshow/125126785.cms,"Mayhem At US Airports: Americans Suffer As FAA Orders 10% Flight Cuts Amid Govt Shutdown | Watch

40 airports to face closures





Political stalemate continues









The US government shutdown has entered uncharted territory, becoming the longest in the country’s history. With no agreement between Republicans and Democrats, key services are now being disrupted and the economic impact is growing. Analysts estimate the shutdown is costing the economy about $15bn a week, as per Bloomberg.Air travel is the latest major sector to be affected. The Federal Aviation Administration says it will reduce flights across 40 busy airports from Friday because of severe staff shortages, and officials warn that delays and cancellations are likely to worsen if the shutdown continues.The congressional deadlock centres on funding for healthcare subsidies and broader government spending. Democrats insist that expiring health insurance tax credits must be renewed and cuts to Medicaid reversed before any agreement is signed. Republicans, who control both chambers but lack the Senate votes needed to pass a spending bill alone, are pushing for a short-term funding measure without concessions. Trump has refused to engage in negotiations until the government is reopened, and at the same time has threatened to permanently sack thousands of federal workers.Nearly 1.4 million federal employees are either on unpaid leave or working without pay. Millions of Americans are already feeling the effects: food assistance has been disrupted, national parks shuttered, government-backed loans frozen, and key economic data suspended. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that growth could fall by up to two percentage points in the final quarter of the year — and that if the shutdown extends to Thanksgiving, around $14bn will never be recovered.The most alarming consequences are now being felt in US air travel. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) says it will reduce flights by 10% across 40 major airports from Friday, citing severe staffing shortages. More than 400 shortages have been logged at FAA facilities since 1 October — four times higher than this time last year. Air traffic controllers have been working unpaid for over a month, many forced into mandatory overtime while struggling to pay bills or even transport costs to work.“We’re going to ask the airlines to work with us collaboratively to reduce their schedules,” FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford said. “We’re in new territory in terms of government shutdowns.”Major aviation unions and airlines warn that hundreds, if not thousands, of flights could be cancelled. Bedford admitted the agency “can’t ignore” the impact of exhausted and unpaid workers, adding that even if the government reopens, normal operations cannot resume immediately. Transport Secretary Sean Duffy has issued some of the starkest warnings so far, saying controllers might miss a second full paycheque next week — a scenario he said could bring “mass chaos”, including the closure of airspace in parts of the country.During the past weekend alone, at least 39 flight control facilities reported potential staffing limits, compared to a pre-shutdown weekend average of just over eight. Travel industry leaders say confidence in America’s air system is being damaged, and the shutdown is “forcing difficult operational decisions” that could ripple across the global aviation network.Despite the mounting crisis, progress in Congress is limited. Senate Majority Leader John Thune claims his “gut” suggests a breakthrough may be near, but Democrats and Republicans remain entrenched. Some moderates in both parties want a deal before Thanksgiving, though repeated Senate votes on a short-term funding plan have failed 14 times.The White House has adopted a more aggressive posture than in previous shutdowns. Trump has not only refused to guarantee retroactive pay for furloughed workers, but has openly sought to permanently fire “non-essential” employees. A federal judge blocked the attempt to lay off around 4,000 workers, but the administration is appealing. “Back pay depends on who we’re talking about,” Trump told reporters. “Some workers don’t deserve to be taken care of. ”Essential services such as border control, hospital care and mail delivery continue, but many others are paralysed. National monuments are shut, government-backed loans stalled, and the suspension of economic reports has fuelled uncertainty among markets and policymakers.During the last shutdown in 2018–19, widespread flight disruptions finally forced an end to the blockade. Analysts warn history could repeat itself — but with air travel already at a breaking point and billions in economic losses mounting, the cost of political stalemate is rising fast. Whether Congress can reach a compromise, and whether the White House will sign it, remains the central unanswered question as the shutdown grinds toward a second month.","The US government shutdown has entered uncharted territory, becoming the longest in the country’s history.

Significance today









Oman will mark National Day with its first-ever formal two-day holiday starting in 2025, commemorating the historic 1650 expulsion of Portuguese forces that restored the nation’s ports and sovereignty. More than a public holiday, it is a celebration of national identity, cultural pride, and community, giving Omanis an extended period to reflect, rejoice, and spend time with their families.Oman’s National Day commemorates the end of Portuguese control over the country. The Portuguese arrived in Oman in 1507, shortly after Vasco da Gama’s voyage around the Cape of Good Hope to India. They fortified Muscat and established it as a strategic port to protect their Indian Ocean trade routes.Over time, the Portuguese presence faced resistance. The influential Al-Ya’ribi clan, frustrated by perceived exploitation, signed a treaty with the British East India Company granting the British rights in Omani ports. This weakened Portuguese control and paved the way for a successful rebellion. On 18 November 1650, Imam Sultan Bin Saif led forces that expelled the Portuguese from Oman and its ports, restoring the nation’s sovereignty.This historic victory is the foundation of Oman’s National Day celebrations.Traditionally, Oman’s National Day was observed on 18 November. To modernize and consolidate the holiday period, His Majesty Sultan Haitham bin Tarik issued Royal Decree No. 15/2025 on 21 January 2025, amending Royal Decree No. 88/2022. The decree established 20 and 21 November as the official National Day holiday, creating a continuous two-day celebration.The decree, published in the Official Gazette (Issue 1581) on 26 January 2025, came into immediate effect. Key points include:This change consolidates the observance into a single holiday period while preserving the historical significance of Oman’s independence.Omanis observe the holiday with patriotic and cultural events:The two-day holiday encourages many Omanis to visit their home villages, often resulting in heavier traffic during the period. These celebrations blend historical remembrance with community engagement, reflecting both pride and unity.Oman’s National Day serves as a reminder of the nation’s historic struggle for independence and a celebration of contemporary national identity. From the historic rebellion against the Portuguese to the modern royal decree consolidating the national holiday, the observance connects Oman’s proud past and vibrant present, highlighting its remarkable journey as a proud, sovereign nation.","Oman’s National Day commemorates the end of Portuguese control over the country.

'Eight planes shot down': Donald Trump adds one more plane in his India-Pakistan ceasefire claim; gives new details,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/eight-planes-shot-down-donald-trump-adds-one-more-plane-in-his-india-pakistan-ceasefire-claim-gives-new-details/articleshow/125128014.cms,"“7-8 Planes Down…” Trump Repeats Ceasefire Claims On India-Pak War





US President Donald Trump has once again reiterated his old claim that India and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire after his intervention.Speaking at an event in Miami, Florida, on Wednesday, Trump added new details to his claims, saying that after his intervention, the next day he received a call claiming that they had made peace after he put out trade conditions.Trump claimed he had solved eight wars in the nine months he had been in office and played a key role in bringing India and Pakistan to a truce. “You know, I was in the midst of a trade deal with both of them (India and Pakistan), and then I read on the front page of a certain newspaper... I heard they were going to war,"" PTI news agency quoted Trump as saying, adding that a total of eight planes had been shot down during the military conflict.His previous claim stood at seven.“I said, this is war, and they are going at it. And they are two nuclear nations. I said, ‘I'm not going to make any trade deals with you guys unless you agree to peace,"" Trump said, adding that his statement took both India and Pakistan by shock.""The two nations said 'No way. This has nothing to do...’ I said, ‘It has everything to do. You are nuclear powers. I'm not trading with you. We're not making any deals with you if you're at war with each other'.""As per the claim made by Trump, this conversation with India and Pakistan took place on May 9. On May 10-2025, both countries announced they had come to a ceasefire understanding and would stop all fighting.""A day later, I get a call saying, 'We made peace'. They stopped. I said, 'Thank you. Let's do trade'. Isn't that great? Tariffs did that… Without tariffs, that would have never happened,"" Trump said amid applause.Trump’s tariff announcement had imposed a 25 percent levy on India in response to what he described as ""the highest tariffs on US goods"" and a 19 percent tariff on Pakistan. He later added an extra 25 percent on India, taking the total to 50 percent, as a penalty for New Delhi’s purchase of Russian oil and its participation in the BRICS bloc, which, according to Trump, fostered anti-American policies.India has repeatedly denied US involvement in the truce. During the G7 Summit in Canada earlier this year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi rejected Trump’s claim.“President Trump clearly that during this period, there was no talk at any stage on subjects like India-US trade deal or US mediation between India and Pakistan,” said Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri in a press statement.The conflict between India and Pakistan escalated after New Delhi launched a tri-service strike called ‘ Operation Sindoor ’, targeting terror camps across Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. The operation followed a terror attack in April in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pahalgam, in which 26 tourists were killed.","US President Donald Trump has once again reiterated his old claim that India and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire after his intervention.

Two days earlier: Another strike in the Pacific





Expanding military presence and legal debate





Political reaction and regional tensions









The United States on Friday carried out another “lethal kinetic strike” on a drug trafficking vessel in the Caribbean, killing three individuals described by Washington as “narco-terrorists. ”US war secretary Pete Hegseth shared a video of the strike on X and said, “As we’ve said before, vessel strikes on narco-terrorists will continue until their poisoning of the American people stops. Today, at the direction of President Trump, the Department of War carried out a lethal kinetic strike on a vessel operated by a Designated Terrorist Organization.”“The vessel was trafficking narcotics in the Caribbean and was struck in international waters. No US forces were harmed in the strike, and three male narco-terrorists — who were aboard the vessel — were killed,” Hegseth said. He added a warning: “To all narco-terrorists who threaten our homeland: if you want to stay alive, stop trafficking drugs. If you keep trafficking deadly drugs—we will kill you.”The latest operation marks the continuation of an intensified maritime campaign launched by the US in early September, targeting what it calls “narco-terrorist” vessels across international waters.Two days prior, the US carried out a similar strike in the eastern Pacific, killing two people aboard another alleged drug vessel. That operation was part of a campaign that, according to official statements, has now destroyed 17 vessels — including a semi-submersible — and resulted in at least 66 deaths.“Today, at the direction of President Trump, the Department of War carried out a lethal kinetic strike on a vessel operated by a Designated Terrorist Organization (DTO),” Hegseth wrote in a post on X, confirming that “intelligence confirmed that the vessel was involved in illicit narcotics smuggling, transiting along a known narco-trafficking route, and carrying narcotics.”The strikes have been conducted primarily in international waters across the Caribbean and eastern Pacific. Washington has not yet publicly provided evidence that the targeted boats posed an imminent threat to the United States.The operations come amid the deployment of an American aircraft carrier to the region, a move analysts view as an expansion of US military presence across Caribbean waters. President Donald Trump has described the strikes as actions within an “armed conflict” against drug cartels, arguing that these groups are “foreign terrorist organisations.”“We will find and terminate EVERY vessel with the intention of trafficking drugs to America to poison our citizens,” Hegseth wrote in another post. “Protecting the homeland is our TOP priority. NO cartel terrorist stands a chance against the American military.”However, legal and human rights experts have criticised the operations as extrajudicial killings, pointing out that the US has not provided a clear legal framework or justification for the strikes, even when the targets are identified drug traffickers. Lawmakers from both parties have demanded greater transparency and a formal explanation for the campaign’s scope and legality.Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, who remains under US indictment on narcoterrorism charges, accused Washington of “fabricating a war” against him as American strikes move closer to his country’s maritime borders.When asked on CBS’s “60 Minutes” whether the US was heading toward war with Venezuela, Trump said, “I doubt it. I don’t think so.” He also agreed that Maduro’s “days are numbered” but declined to say whether he would authorise land strikes.The series of strikes underscores Washington’s renewed militarised approach to narcotics interdiction, marking a sharp escalation in US counter-narcotics operations across international waters — and raising questions about the boundaries of its campaign under international law.","U.S. carried out another “lethal kinetic strike” on a drug trafficking vessel in the Caribbean, killing three individuals described by Washington as “narco- terrorists” The latest operation marks the continuation of an intensified maritime campaign launched by the US in early September.

UPS on Thursday identified the flight crew killed in a fiery plane crash on Tuesday at Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport (SDF) in Kentucky, which claimed the lives of 12 people and left nearly a dozen others injured.The three deceased UPS pilots on board Flight 2976 were identified as Capt. Richard Wartenberg, 1st Officer Lee Truitt, and International Relief Officer Capt. Dana Diamond, according to UPS Airlines executive vice president Nando Cesarone.""Our hearts go out to every UPSer who has been impacted and all in our Louisville community – supporting you and ensuring you receive the care and resources you need is our priority.

We extend our deepest sympathies to the family and friends of our colleagues, and to the loved ones of those in the Louisville community,"" the UPS said in a statement.“Words can’t express the sorrow we feel over the heartbreaking Flight 2976 accident,” Cesarone wrote in a statement on X.“Our hearts go out to every UPSer who has been impacted and all in our Louisville community— supporting you and ensuring you receive the care and resources you need is our priority.”The UPS cargo plane, which was loaded with about 38,000 gallons of fuel and bound for Hawaii, crashed into the nearby Kentucky Petroleum Recycling building after departing from SDF at about 5:15 p.m. ET Tuesday, according to Gov. Andy Beshear.At the time of the disaster, the oil recycling company had 29 above-ground storage tanks containing about 226 000 gallons of used motor oil and 37 000 gallons of oil-water-antifreeze mix, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). EPA on-scene coordinators confirmed several of the large, above-ground storage tanks at Kentucky Petroleum Recycling broke open and fell over. The facility remained closed while the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigated.Preliminary flight data indicated the aircraft’s last recorded elevation was 475 feet, and it was travelling at 183 knots at the time of the crash, according to NTSB officials. The EPA confirmed there was no hazardous material cargo on board the aircraft.At least 12 people were dead, including the three crew members on board and a young child, and 11 others on the ground were injured, Beshear said. Others were still unaccounted for.Though the cause of the crash had not yet been released, NTSB officials said Wednesday the left engine detached from the plane and was found on the airfield.On Thursday, the NTSB confirmed data was successfully recovered from the aircraft’s cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder, commonly known as the “black box,” at a Washington, D.C. lab. NTSB officials said the plane had been in San Antonio, Texas, for six weeks prior to the crash and that it may have been used as a replacement shortly before take-off due to maintenance issues with the originally scheduled aircraft.The EPA worked closely with state and local agencies, along with UPS, to clean up oil released into nearby streams that flow into the Salt and Ohio rivers. EPA officials said the agency would remain on site to ensure clean air, land and water for nearby residents.The NTSB confirmed the FBI was assisting with the investigation “under a longstanding Interagency agreement.”The Louisville airport is home to UPS Worldport, a global hub for the shipping company’s air cargo operations and its largest package-handling facility worldwide.","UPS on Thursday identified the flight crew killed in a fiery plane crash on Tuesday at Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport.

‘Sandwich guy’ acquitted: Who is Sean Dunn and how did he become the face of DC resistance?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/sandwich-guy-acquitted-who-is-sean-dunn-and-how-did-he-become-the-face-of-dc-resistance/articleshow/125147239.cms,"Who is Sean Dunn?

How did he became the face of DC resistance?





A US man, who threw a footlong sandwich at a federal officer, has been found not guilty and is today popularly known as a ""sandwich guy.""A video of Sean Charles Dunn, ""sandwich guy,"" throwing a sandwich at the officer's car has gone viral, showing him pointing and shouting at officers as they crossed the junction.“F*** you, fascists,” he yelled, then chanted “shame” before turning and walking away. “I don’t want you in my city,” he screamed at them. Minutes later, he returned, continued shouting and threw his sandwich — salami, the Washington Post reported.According to CNN, Dunn served as an international-affairs specialist in the United States Department of Justice Criminal Division. He was terminated following the sandwich incident.Attorney-General Pam Bondi announced his dismissal on social media as a warning to federal employees. In her statement Bondi said, ""This is an example of the Deep State we have been up against for seven months as we work to refocus DOJ. You will NOT work in this administration while disrespecting our government and law enforcement.""In the week since the sandwich was slung, Dunn’s likeness has appeared around the city and on social media.Memes and protest art have flooded Washington accounts. At demonstrations, protesters held Subway sandwiches aloft as a symbol of defiance, and shirts bearing his image are now on sale.He’s also become the face of DC’s resistance to the law enforcement surge implemented by President Donald Trump’s administration, WTOP reported.In homage to graffiti artist Banksy’s “Flower Thrower,” images of Dunn throwing the sandwich started popping up on buildings around the District and T-shirts worn by Washingtonians.Speaking to some DC residents in front of “the sandwich thrower” image on Columbia Road in Adams Morgan, WTOP tried to find out why so many have thrown their support behind Dunn.“I think it’s more of like a folk hero thing,’’ Connor told WTOP. “He’s just sort of a symbol for the emotion that everybody is feeling, watching people get abducted off the streets and mistreated and manhandled.”“Whoever came up with that transposition, I mean, that’s a brilliant piece of street art,” said Jeffrey Ian Ross, a criminologist at the University of Baltimore specialising in graffiti and street art, Washington Post reported.“And it will be one of several. When somebody writes the history of this period, that will definitely be one of the iconic images that comes out of it.”Ross described the episode as a “perfect storm” for virality, noting the irony of Dunn’s federal employment and the high-profile felony charge. He added that the slapstick nature of a thwacking sandwich and a flat-footed police chase made the incident particularly memorable.Rochester-based artist Adam Goldfarb, who lived in the DC area for 15 years, has designed shirts featuring a cartoon hoagie over the word “resist”, complete with an eye patch. “Nobody wants to waste a sandwich. But looking at this administration, the cruelty, the corruption, the disregard for basic democratic values and societal norms, it feels like, so often, there’s nothing we can do. So I totally understand this, ‘We just need to do something,’ and you’ve got a sandwich in your hand,” he said.

US jury finds 'sandwich guy' not guilty of assaulting border agent with sub,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-jury-finds-sandwich-guy-not-guilty-of-assaulting-border-agent-with-sub/articleshow/125147087.cms,"



A US protester who was charged for using a sandwich to assault a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agent was found ""not guilty"" on Thursday after a jury decided that charges brought by President Donald Trump’s prosecutors were baloney.The verdict in Washington Capitol Square came after 37-year-old Sean Dunn was accused of flinging a ""sub-style sandwich"" at an armed CBP officer on August 10 in a busy nightlife district following a barrage of shouted expletives, AP news agency reported.Prosecutors initially sought serious felony charges under a campaign ordered by President Trump to crack down on crime in the capital. However, a grand jury refused to indict Dunn on any felony count. A single misdemeanor charge was filed, carrying a maximum penalty of one year’s imprisonment.Dunn was chased and released immediately after the sandwich-throwing incident, only to be arrested later in a highly publicised White House-announced raid on his home.As video of the altercation went viral, he earned the nickname DC sandwich guy and became a symbol of resistance to the President’s law enforcement measures.Stylised images of him in mid-attack appeared on posters, graffiti, T-shirts and even as a popular Halloween costume.The top Trump-appointed prosecutor in Washington, Jeanine Pirro, has pursued maximum penalties for arrests since taking office, including in Dunn’s case. Media analysis of the President’s crime crackdown shows that many new arrests and indictments have stemmed from minor offences.At the trial’s opening on Monday, Judge Carl J Nichols said he expected proceedings to be brief, declaring ""this is the simplest case in the world."" Dunn’s defence did not dispute that he threw the sandwich, but argued that the act did not constitute an offence and described the prosecution as a ""blatant abuse of power.""Central to the trial was whether the tossing of a soft object could be deemed ""forcible"" and whether it impeded the officer’s duties. Dunn, then a Justice Department paralegal, was dismissed from his position after the incident.","Sean Dunn, 37, was accused of flinging a ""sub-style sandwich"" at an armed CBP officer on August 10 in a busy nightlife district.

SNAP benefits: US federal judge orders Trump administration to release full payments amid shutdown,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/snap-benefits-us-federal-judge-orders-trump-administration-to-release-full-payments-amid-shutdown/articleshow/125146989.cms,"Trump’s SNAP Cuts Leave Millions Hungry Amid Shutdown; White House Announces 'Partial' Payments





SNAP recipients will now not go without food support, as a US federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to deliver full benefit payments to states by Friday.In Rhode Island on Thursday, US District Judge John J. McConnell Jr. ordered the administration to disburse the payments through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, though it was unlikely the 42 million Americans — about one in eight — would see the money on their food debit cards so swiftly, AP news agency reported.The order followed a challenge by cities and non-profit organisations that the administration had proposed covering only 65 per cent of the maximum benefit, which might leave some recipients without any payment this month.“The defendants failed to consider the practical consequences associated with this decision to only partially fund SNAP,” McConnell said. “They knew that there would be a long delay in paying partial SNAP payments and failed to consider the harms individuals who rely on those benefits would suffer.”McConnell was one of two judges who ruled last week that the administration could not skip November’s benefits entirely because of the federal shutdown.Last week’s rulings required the govt to use an emergency reserve fund containing $4.6 billion to pay for SNAP for November but gave it leeway to tap other money to make the full payments, which cost between $8.5 billion and $9 billion each month.On Monday, the administration said it would not use additional funds, arguing that Congress must appropriate the programme’s money. The following day, President Trump appeared to threaten withholding the benefits entirely unless Congressional Democrats agreed to reopen the government. His press secretary later clarified that partial benefits would be paid for November and that future payments were at risk if the shutdown persisted.Late on Wednesday, the USDA, which administers the programme, filed in federal court in Rhode Island that further analysis had shown the maximum benefit would amount to just 65 per cent of the usual sum.After the US federal government shut down at the start of October, Congress was unable to approve additional spending, resulting in states not receiving funds to top up participants’ SNAP cards. The programme worked by issuing reloadable debit cards that people could use to buy essential grocery items at supermarkets or via Amazon for grocery delivery. Although states administered the programme themselves, they relied heavily on funding from the federal govt.",US judge orders full benefits to be paid to 42 million Americans by Friday.

How much is Michael Burry worth today?





A contrarian once more





Michael Burry, the real-life investor immortalised by Christian Bale in(2015), built his reputation on one of the most daring financial calls in modern history. Long before the 2008 financial crisis hit, Burry identified the fragility of the US mortgage-backed securities market and positioned his hedge fund, Scion Capital, to profit from its collapse. When the crash came, he and his investors made hundreds of millions of dollars.Originally trained as a medical doctor, Burry’s passion for markets began while studying at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. His transition from medicine to money management was grounded in deep, data-driven value investing and rigorous fundamental analysis. By the time he launched Scion Capital in 2000, his contrarian instincts had already set him apart. Even during the dot-com crash, his fund posted strong returns by identifying undervalued stocks and shorting overhyped ones.Today, Burry runs Scion Asset Management, a private investment firm that continues his trademark contrarian strategy, betting against what he sees as overvalued assets and taking long positions on those the market underappreciates. His reputation for spotting bubbles before they burst has made his every move a matter of public fascination.Burry’s unpredictable presence on social media, where he often posts ominous one-liners before deleting them, only fuels this fascination. An X (formerly Twitter) account calledexists solely to preserve his deleted posts. Yet since spring 2023, the legendary investor has gone completely silent online, until a week ago.After two quiet years, Michael Burry has re-emerged with another high-conviction bet, this time targeting the booming AI sector. Through Scion Asset Management, he has placed put options worth a combined $1.1 billion against two of the industry’s most celebrated companies: Nvidia and Palantir Technologies.The latest regulatory filings show Scion purchased:These positions together dominate Scion’s portfolio, accounting for nearly 80 percent of its total US holdings. The portfolio itself has shrunk from 15 positions in June 2025 to just eight by the end of Septembe, a clear sign of Burry’s conviction.Through this move, Burry is effectively wagering that the current AI boom, driven by soaring valuations and investor euphoria, is unsustainable. In his view, the growth of cloud computing is slowing, capital expenditures are ballooning, and the market’s expectations have run far ahead of economic reality. He has even compared the AI rally to the dot-com bubble of the early 2000s and the housing bubble he famously shorted in 2008.Whether this new “Big Short 2.0” proves prophetic or premature remains to be seen, but the audacity of the move has reignited debate across Wall Street about whether artificial intelligence is becoming the next great bubble.Burry’s Q3 2025 portfolio reflects extreme concentration and conviction, a hallmark of his investing style.Two-thirds of Scion Asset Management’s entire portfolio rests on the Palantir short alone, an extraordinary level of concentration that rivals Burry’s famous 2008 mortgage trade. With nearly $1 billion tied up in AI-related shorts, this position dominates the firm’s holdings and highlights Burry’s conviction that AI valuations are dangerously inflated.To put this in context, Scion Asset Management now manages a total U.S. stock portfolio of around $1.38 billion, meaning that the Palantir and Nvidia bets alone account for the bulk of the firm’s exposure. The move is either a masterstroke of foresight, if the AI market corrects sharply, or a high-stakes overreach, should valuations continue to rise.As of early 2025, Michael Burry’s personal net worth is estimated at around $300 million. This figure reflects his cumulative earnings from past trades, fund management fees, and personal investments, including the extraordinary profits he made during the 2008 housing market collapse.However, this valuation tells only part of the story. Burry’s wealth could have been considerably higher were it not for the timing of one pivotal trade made through his investment firm, Scion Asset Management, in 2020.At the time, Scion had quietly built a significant stake of about 1.7 million shares, representing roughly 5.3 percent of GameStop Corp, a struggling video game retailer that Burry believed was both undervalued and heavily shorted. His thesis was simple yet prescient: the company’s balance sheet was cleaner than the market assumed, and its aggressive share buybacks and renewed sharp focus on e-commerce could deliver a strong turnaround.Yet just as the now-infamous GameStop short squeeze was about to unfold, Burry exited his position. Scion sold its entire holding in the fourth quarter of 2020, when GameStop’s share price hovered between $10 and $20. The sale likely netted the fund around $100 million, a solid return, but modest compared with what was to follow.Only weeks later, retail traders, galvanised by online forums and zero-commission trading — sent GameStop’s shares soaring to nearly $480 per share in January 2021. Had Burry held Scion’s full position through that peak, the fund could have realised gains exceeding $1 billion.While hindsight makes the missed windfall stark, the decision was consistent with Burry’s disciplined, fundamentals-driven approach: he had invested in GameStop for its intrinsic value, not to chase a speculative frenzy. Still, the timing underscores how even the market’s most contrarian minds cannot always predict the unpredictable.Michael Burry’s decision to short Nvidia and Palantir is a defining moment of his post-crisis career. It brings him full circle, once again challenging market consensus when enthusiasm is at its peak. His record suggests that when he sees irrational exuberance, he acts decisively and often alone.Whether his latest wager against the AI boom becomes another legendary call or a rare misstep, Burry’s conviction remains unmistakable. In a market captivated by artificial intelligence and growth narratives, he stands as a reminder that even in 2025, one of finance’s most famous sceptics still sees reason to bet against the crowd.","Michael Burry, the real-life investor immortalised by Christian Bale in(2015), built his reputation on one of the most daring financial calls in modern history.

Carlson said it's not trie as many Jews have been critical of Israel but he railed against 'Christian Zionists' and called Texas Senator Ted Cruz and former president George W Bush victims of 'brain virus'.“If you sit there with someone who says Adolf Hitler was very, very cool and that their mission is to combat and defeat ‘global Jewry,’ and you say nothing, then you are a coward and you are complicit in that evil,” Ted Cruz attacked Carlson.",Heritage Foundation president Kevin Roberts apologized amid the row over his support for Tucker Carlson.

Sam Parker is a former US Senate candidate in Utah who has been questioning Alexis Wilkins' background and allegiance and concluded that she is an Israeli spy who was possibly set up with Kash Patel by some other intel operative. Parker has 98.5K followers on X where he made a long thread on Wilkins proving that she works for PragerU and PragerU CEO Marissa Streit is 'definitely a spy'.Earlier, Wilkins sued Kyle Seraphin, a former FBI agent, for defamation with the same allegation that she is a spy.The lawsuit, filed in federal court, said Samuel Parker repeatedly lied about Alexis, falsely suggesting that she is an Israeli agent, assigned to manipulate and compromise FBI director Kash Patel.

Pakistan’s foreign minister Ishaq Dar has admitted that he negotiated several agreements with the Taliban administration in Kabul, but was unable to implement any of them because Islamabad had not authorised him to make final decisions. Speaking in parliament, and quoted by TOLOnews, Dar said his visit to Afghanistan had been positive but ultimately meaningless due to the Pakistani government’s restrictions on his authority.Dar told lawmakers: “The meetings were very positive; I was warmly received. I didn’t leave the work unfinished there. I know our system does not allow me to make decisions. I wanted to return and implement all that was agreed upon, but the system doesn’t allow it.”His admission highlights growing institutional disarray in Islamabad as the government struggles to manage one of Pakistan’s most volatile diplomatic relationships.

A fragile ceasefire is currently in place and both sides agreed to three basic principles: continuation of the truce, a monitoring and verification mechanism, and penalties for any violations. Operational details are expected to be finalised in Istanbul.Despite this, mistrust remains deep.

Polish FM Snubs Pak FM Ishaq Dar's 'Kashmir' Rant, Issues Warning On Illegal Immigration

.





Pakistan’s deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar has said that a symbolic “cup of tea” in Afghanistan’s capital, Kabul, turned out to be a costly mistake for Pakistan. He reiterated that such a mistake should never be repeated.Speaking in the Senate on Wednesday, Dar criticised the previous Imran Khan-led Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government, saying that under the pretext of that “cup of tea,” Pakistan had opened its borders to Afghanistan. He described this move as a serious error in judgment.“It was a big mistake and should not be repeated,” Dar said, news agency ANI reported, quoting Afghanistan’s Tolo News.Dar’s comments referred to the 2021 visit of the then-ISI chief, Lt Gen Faiz Hameed, to Kabul shortly after the Taliban seized control of Afghanistan following the withdrawal of US and allied forces.Recalling his earlier remarks made in London last year, Dar said Pakistan was “still paying the price” for that decision.He linked the surge in terrorist attacks in Pakistan to militant groups allegedly operating from Afghan soil, including the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Fitna al-Khawarij, and the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), according to ARY News.Dar added that he had held six phone conversations with Afghanistan’s foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, to raise Pakistan’s concerns and demand that Afghan territory not be used for terrorist activities.However, Afghanistan’s ministry of foreign affairs has rejected Dar’s claim.In a post on X, ministry spokesperson Hafiz Zia Ahmad said the Pakistani minister’s statements “lacked accuracy,” clarifying that the phone conversation took place in a spirit of “mutual understanding and coordination.”""The recent statements by the Pakistani Foreign Minister, in which he claimed that the Foreign Minister of the Islamic Emirate in Afghanistan, Mullah Amir Khan Muttaqi, had contacted him six times in one day, lack accuracy and realism. In fact, the first phone contact between the two sides was aimed at mutual understanding and coordination,"" the post read.Ahmad further said Dar had initially mentioned not being fully briefed on the issue and would follow up after reviewing the matter.Despite the tensions, Dar expressed hope that upcoming talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan scheduled for November 6 in Istanbul would help strengthen cooperation on security issues.Last month, relations between the two neighbours deteriorated after Pakistan carried out airstrikes inside Afghan territory, prompting retaliatory fire from the Afghan side and intense border clashes.Following mediation by Qatar and Turkiye, both countries agreed to a ceasefire, which was later extended. The Istanbul meeting will focus on finalising steps for its continued implementation, according to the Turkish Foreign Ministry.","Pakistan’s deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar has said that a symbolic “cup of tea” in Afghanistan”s capital, Kabul, turned out to be a costly mistake for Pakistan.

Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Powers Set To Grow As Shehbaz Govt Mulls 27th Constitution Amendment





The Pakistan government announced plans to introduce the 27th Constitutional Amendment, which includes proposed changes related to the command of the armed forces. The amendment will be tabled in Parliament soon, deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar confirmed on Tuesday.“Of course, the government is bringing it and will bring it … the 27th Amendment will arrive … and is about to arrive. We will try that it be tabled in accordance with principles, laws and the Constitution,” Dar said in the Senate, as quoted by PTI.According to sources, the proposed amendment includes provisions to set up a constitutional court, streamline the process for appointing the chief election commissioner, amend Article 243 dealing with matters of the armed forces, reduce the provinces’ share in federal resources, and transfer control of the education and population welfare ministries from provinces to the federal government.Article 243 of the Constitution states that “the federal government shall have control and command of the armed forces.” The proposal to revise this article is being viewed as a move that could further strengthen the position of Army Chief General Asim Munir and expand the military’s role in national affairs.Dar rejected concerns that the amendment might be passed without proper procedure. “It is not the case that the amendment is tabled and there is voting on it in a haphazard, ad hoc manner; this will not happen,” he said.He said the amendment would first be introduced in the Senate and then referred to a bipartisan committee for discussion, adding that the government would welcome positive suggestions to improve the draft.PPP Senator Raza Rabbani said the changes would damage provincial autonomy and “undo the good work of the 18th amendment,” which devolved powers to the provinces in 2010.The government has the required two-thirds majority in the 336-member National Assembly with the support of 233 members. In the 96-member Senate, it holds 61 seats and will need at least three opposition members to pass the amendment.The secrecy around the proposed changes, particularly the plan to amend Article 243, has drawn attention to whether the new constitutional move will give the armed forces greater influence in the country’s governance.","Pakistani government announces plans to introduce the 27th Constitutional Amendment.

NEW DELHI: At least 12 people were injured in an explosion in the Pakistan Supreme Court basement that jolted the building. The blast was caused by a cylinder bursting in the court's basement cafeteria. Following the blast, lawyers and court staff were immediately evacuated, and the injured were taken to the hospital.Videos shared by eyewitnesses showed damage to the Supreme Court building. However, the damage seems significant for a cylinder explosion, as shards of broken tiles lying on the ground are visible in the video.Casualties included AC technicians who bore the brunt, two being in critical condition, out of whom one sustained burns over 80% of the body, per early reports. Rescue teams transported the injured to nearby hospitals, with authorities tightening security and cordoning off the cafeteria zone.According to The Express Tribune, Islamabad's inspector general, Ali Nasir Rizvi, said the blast happened around 10:55am. He said a gas leak had occurred in the basement cafeteria for several days. The explosion occurred while the AC was undergoing maintenance. As per the reports, the AC technicians operating on the appliance sustained the most injury where one of them suffering burns on 80 per cent of his body.""The condition of two individuals is critical,"" stated the inspector general.Bomb Disposal Squad also arrived on the scene to carry out an investigation and collect evidence to rule out alternate causes and assess structural impact.Local outlets reported the blast around late morning hours, with tremors felt across lower floors and minor to moderate interior damage documented on video. Court operations were briefly disrupted as evacuation protocols kicked in; access remains restricted pending safety clearance. A formal report is expected to detail maintenance procedures, gas safety compliance, and any required retrofits to the cafeteria and AC systems. Authorities are reviewing emergency readiness across federal buildings in Islamabad following the incident.","At least 12 people were injured in an explosion in the Pakistan Supreme Court basement that jolted the building.

A gas cylinder exploded in the basement cafeteria of the Supreme Court of Pakistan building in Islamabad early Tuesday morning, causing the building to tremble and injuring around a dozen people, according to law-enforcement authorities and media reports.According to Ali Nasir Rizvi, Islamabad’s inspector general of police, the isolated incident occurred in the court’s canteen while an air-conditioning unit was being repaired.He confirmed that “a gas explosion occurred in the Supreme Court canteen at 10:55am (local time).” He added that “experts have also confirmed that it was a gas explosion.”The IG further pointed out that “there had been a gas leak in the canteen for several days” and that the technicians repairing the AC sustained the most serious injuries, with one technician suffering burns on 80 per cent of his body.Following the blast, around 15 people were shifted to hospital treatment centres; of these, 12 were confirmed injured by the IG. Among them, three were admitted to the Pakistan institute of medical sciences (PIMS) and nine to the Polyclinic Hospital. He noted that “the condition of two individuals is critical.”Emergency procedures were rapidly activated: lawyers and court officials evacuated the building and moved to open areas outside, and the bomb disposal squad screened the affected zone. The building’s canteen reportedly suffered damage to furniture, and the shock-wave from the explosion was felt through the lower floors of the court complex.While investigations are ongoing, the IG called attention to the pre-existing gas leak and the maintenance work being carried out on the AC system as key factors in the incident.","A gas cylinder exploded in the basement cafeteria of the Supreme Court of Pakistan building in Islamabad early Tuesday morning.

Pakistan Among Countries Testing Nuclear Weapons, Donald Trump Says While Announcing US Testing Plan





US President Donald Trump has claimed that Pakistan is among several countries actively testing nuclear weapons, asserting that this justifies his administration’s decision to resume America’s own nuclear testing after more than 30 years.In an interview with CBS News’ 60 Minutes on Sunday, Trump said that Russia, China, North Korea and Pakistan were all conducting tests while the United States had refrained from doing so.“Russia’s testing and China’s testing, but they don’t talk about it. We’re an open society. We’re different. We talk about it because otherwise you people are going to report. They don’t have reporters that are going to be writing about it,” he said.“We’re going to test because they test and others test. And certainly North Korea’s been testing. Pakistan’s been testing,” Trump added.When questioned about his decision to resume nuclear detonations, Trump argued that such testing was necessary to ensure the reliability of US weapons systems, citing recent trials of advanced nuclear-capable systems by Russia.“You have to see how they work... We’re the only country that doesn’t test.And I don’t want to be the only country that doesn’t test,” he said.Confusion surrounded Trump’s announcement, first made on social media minutes before his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea. The last US nuclear explosion occurred in 1992.While no country other than North Korea is known to have conducted a detonation for decades, Trump maintained that “they test way underground where people don’t know exactly what’s happening.”US energy secretary Chris Wright later clarified that current discussions referred to “non-critical” system tests, not full nuclear explosions.",US President Donald Trump has claimed that Pakistan is among several countries actively testing nuclear weapons.

Pakistan Issues Naval Warning as Its War Games Overlap with India’s Military Drills





Pakistan, heavily dependent on the waters of the Indus basin, faces a acute risk of insufficient water storage after India suspended the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) earlier this year, according to the Ecological Threat Report 2025.The report, released by the Institute for Economics and Peace, a Sydney-based independent and non-profit think tank, says the suspension gives India the ability to control the westward flow of the Indus and its tributaries into Pakistan. The move came after India decided to put the treaty in abeyance as a punitive measure following the Pakistan-sponsored Pahalgam terror attack on April 22 this year.This marks a major setback for Pakistan, whose agriculture depends 80 per cent on the Indus River system. The report highlighted that Pakistan’s dams can currently hold only about 30 days of Indus flow, leaving the country highly vulnerable to disruptions.“Pakistan lacks sufficient storage to buffer variations,” the report warned, adding, “If India were truly to cut off or significantly reduce Indus flows, Pakistan’s densely populated plains would face severe water shortages, especially in winter and dry seasons.Indeed, about 80 per cent of Pakistan’s irrigated agriculture depends on Indus basin rivers.”While India’s infrastructure limits its ability to completely stop river flows, even small disruptions could have ""disastrous"" short-term effects on Pakistan’s farm sector.In May, India carried out “reservoir flushing” operations at the Salal and Baglihar dams on the Chenab River without notifying Pakistan. This process, used to remove silt by draining reservoirs, had been restricted under the treaty due to the risk of sudden downstream changes.The impact was immediate: parts of the Chenab River in Pakistan’s Punjab ran dry for several days when India shut the dam gates and later released sediment-filled torrents upon reopening them.The Indus Waters Treaty, signed in 1960 and mediated by the World Bank, has long acted as a key tool for water-sharing and conflict resolution between the two countries. It governs the use of the Indus River and its six major tributaries -- five on the left bank and one on the right.","India suspended the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) earlier this year.

Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan’s (TTP) second-in-command Amjad, a key figure in the banned militant group, was killed along with three other militants when security forces foiled an infiltration attempt from Afghanistan into Pakistan, the army said on Thursday.According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), cited by PTI, the militants tried to cross the Pakistan-Afghanistan border in Bajaur district on Wednesday night when their movement was detected.“The troops effectively engaged and thwarted the militants' attempt to infiltrate,” the statement said, adding that four militants, including high-value target Amjad alias Mazahim, were “sent to hell.”Amjad, who served as deputy to TTP chief Noor Wali and headed the group’s Rehbari Shura, was among Pakistan’s most wanted militants, carrying a bounty of Rs five million. The ISPR said he was “actively involved in perpetuating numerous terrorist activities inside Pakistan while residing in Afghanistan.”The army also urged the interim Afghan government to take “concrete measures to ensure that Afghan soil is not used by militants to perpetrate terrorism against Pakistan.”Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif lauded the security forces for eliminating the TTP commander and his aides. Prime Minister Shehbaz said the security forces, through their professional expertise, eliminated the highly wanted TTP commander Amjad and thwarted “the nefarious designs of the enemies of Pakistan's sovereignty.” He added, “We will continue to defeat the elements that harm innocent people. ”The operation in Bajaur came a day after six Pakistani soldiers, including a captain, were martyred during an intelligence-based operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Kurram district, where seven terrorists were also gunned down.Formed in 2007 as an umbrella organisation of several militant outfits, the TTP seeks to impose its strict version of Islam across Pakistan.

Growing tensions on the border







Pakistan has admitted to having an agreement with the United States that allows the use of drones within its territory, TOLOnews reported, citing Afghan and diplomatic sources. The acknowledgment, made during the latest round of Pakistan-Afghanistan peace talks in Turkey.According to TOLOnews, the Pakistani delegation said it “cannot break” the agreement with Washington that authorises drone operations. Afghan negotiators, in response, demanded written guarantees that Pakistan would not allow US drones to use its airspace or strike Afghan territory. Sources familiar with the talks, cited by TOLOnews said Pakistan’s delegation initially agreed to these conditions but later reversed its position after receiving instructions from Islamabad, saying it had “no control over US drones and could not ensure action against ISIS. ” Qatari and Turkish mediators were reportedly taken aback by the sudden shift in stance.The Afghan side reiterated that the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) issue was Pakistan’s own internal problem. “The Islamic Emirate has repeatedly emphasised, and again reaffirmed, that insecurity in Pakistan is a domestic matter,” TOLOnews quoted its delegation as saying, adding that Afghanistan remains committed to ensuring no group uses its soil to harm other nations.The disclosure came as four days of talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan in Istanbul collapsed without agreement. Pakistan’s information minister Attaullah Tarar said the dialogue “failed to bring about any workable solution,” blaming Kabul for refusing to act against militants responsible for cross-border attacks. “Pakistan’s patience has run its course,” Tarar said, adding that Islamabad “would continue to take all possible measures necessary to protect our people from terrorism. ”Pakistani Defence Minister Khawaja Asif issued a strong warning to the Taliban regime, vowing that Islamabad could “strike deep into Afghanistan” if further attacks occurred. “If their territory is used and they violate ours, we will retaliate — we surely will,” Asif told reporters. In a separate post on X, he cautioned Kabul against testing Pakistan’s “resolve and capabilities at its own peril and doom.”The breakdown in talks follows weeks of escalating border clashes that left dozens dead. Pakistan’s military earlier this month struck what it described as TTP hideouts inside Afghanistan, prompting retaliatory attacks that killed Pakistani soldiers. Though a ceasefire brokered by Qatar on 19 October remains technically in effect, all major crossings between the two countries remain closed, with hundreds of trucks stranded.Islamabad insists that the Afghan Taliban continues to shelter militants who launch attacks in Pakistan, a charge Kabul denies.

Days after Jaish-e-Mohammed announced the formation of its first-ever women's wing, 'Jamaat-ul-Mominaat', the JeM's chief Masood Azhar has released a 21-minute audio message from group's Bahawalpur headquarters, Markaz Usman o Ali, outlining a detailed plan for training, indoctrinating, and deploying women under the new unit, as local media reported.According to media reports, in the audio, Azhar explains how women will be recruited, trained, and integrated into his long-term ""global jihad"" mission, mirroring the structure of JeM's long-running male training programme.Azhar declares that just as men undergo the 15-day ""Daura-e-Tarbiat"" course, women joining 'Jamaat-ul-Mominaat' will be trained through an induction course named ""Daura-e-Taskiya"", conducted at Markaz Usman o Ali in Bahawalpur.For the past two decades, JeM's ""Daura-e-Tarbiat"" has served as the primary indoctrination stage for male recruits, convincing them that jihad against India guarantees paradise. Azhar now intends to extend the same ideological training to women.In his speech, the wanted terrorist promises that any woman who joins Jamaat-ul-Mominaat “will go straight to paradise from her grave after death.”He added that women completing the first course will advance to a second stage, ""Daura-Ayat-ul-Nisah,"" which will teach how Islamic texts ""instruct women to conduct jihad.""Justifying the formation of a female brigade, most-wanted terrorist Azhar claimed, ""The enemies of Jaish have put Hindu women into the army and set up female journalists against us,"" declaring that he is ""mobilising his women to compete and fight against them.""He asserts that JeM’s male Mujahids will work alongside this new female unit, saying the women’s brigade will ""spread Islam across the world.""Azhar also announces that Jamaat-ul-Mominaat branches will be opened in every district of Pakistan , each headed by a District Muntazima responsible for recruiting local women. He lays down strict communication rules, stating, ""Women joining the brigade must not speak to any unrelated men through phone or messenger, except their husbands or immediate family members.""According to IANS, the women’s wing will be led by Sadiya Azhar, sister of Masood Azhar. Her husband, Yusuf Azhar, was killed during Operation Sindoor on May 7, when Indian forces targeted JeM’s previous base, Markaz Subhanallah.""His other sister Samaira Azhar, and Afeera Farooq, widow of Pulwama attacker Umar Farooq, are also part of the leadership,"" sources confirmed, adding that “they are tasked with conducting daily online sessions to motivate and recruit women.”JeM has since verified these details in a new poster naming Umme Masood (real name Samaira Azhar) as the instructor for online classes, conducted five days a week from October 25.Azhar further reveals that Jamaat-ul-Mominaat includes “4–5 women whose male relatives were killed in encounters with the Indian Army,” who will inspire new recruits under a campaign called “Shoba-e-Dawat.”He urges women cadres to read his book “Ae Musalman Behna” (O Muslim Sister) as part of their indoctrination.It is significant that 14 members of Masood Azhar’s family were killed in India’s Operation Sindoor, including Yousuf Azhar, Jameel Ahmed, Hamza Jameel, and Huzaifa Azhar. Azhar now claims that his elder sister Hawa Bibi also died in the same strike.In the audio, an emotional Azhar recounts that he had conceptualised the idea of a women’s brigade with his sister before her death.In retaliation for the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir, which claimed the lives of 26 civilians, India launched a major military operation targeting Pakistan-based terror infrastructure. The counterterror action, named Operation Sindoor, struck nine key terror hubs across Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.The strikes destroyed major bases of Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), including their headquarters in Bahawalpur and Muridke, which were reduced to rubble by precision airstrikes carried out by the Indian armed forces.In response, Pakistan attempted retaliation by launching multiple drones and missiles towards Indian territory the following night. However, India’s advanced air defence systems swiftly intercepted and neutralised the incoming threats, preventing any casualties or damage.India then answered this provocation with targeted strikes on crucial Pakistani airbases, including the strategically significant Nur Khan Airbase and Rahim Yar Khan Airbase.The heightened military tensions between the two neighbours were eventually de-escalated following a mutual peace agreement, initiated by Pakistan’s Director General of Military Operations (DGMO).Since then, these outfits have reportedly relocated to Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) region to avoid further strikes. Their leaders have been issuing propaganda messages and appeals for funds to rebuild their networks.Media sources also reveal that Masood Azhar has been aggressively collecting donations. During his September 27 address at Markaz Usman o Ali, he publicly appealed for financial support.JeM is now collecting a donation of 500 PKR from every woman enrolling in the new course and requiring them to fill out online registration forms.Earlier, on October 8, Masood Azhar formally announced the formation of Jamaat-ul-Mominaat, followed by an event titled “Dukhtaran-e-Islam” in Rawalakot, PoK, on October 19, aimed at drawing women into the organisation.While groups like ISIS, Boko Haram, Hamas, and LTTE have long deployed women in combat and suicide missions, organisations such as JeM, LeT, and Hizbul Mujahideen had largely avoided such practices -- until now. Security agencies believe JeM’s latest move signals its intent to train and deploy female suicide bombers in future terror operations.","Jaish-e-Mohammed announces formation of women's wing, 'Jamaat-ul-Mominaat' JeM's chief Masood Azhar releases 21-minute audio message from group's Bahawalpur headquarters, Markaz Usman o Ali.

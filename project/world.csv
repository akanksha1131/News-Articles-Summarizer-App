British billionaire Richard Branson, best known as the adventurous founder of the Virgin Group, recently experienced an unusual moment on the bustling streets of New York City. While promoting his latest initiative, Doorbell of Dreams, the 75-year-old tycoon tried stopping passersby for quick interviews, only to be repeatedly ignored. Despite his global fame and media presence, New Yorkers brushed past him as though he were just another man with a microphone or a street performer. The incident, filmed by entrepreneur Simon Squibb, quickly went viral on Instagram, sparking amusement, admiration, and lighthearted commentary online. What began as a fun campaign to encourage everyday dreamers to pitch their business ideas turned into an unexpected lesson in humility, showing that even billionaires are not immune to everyday rejection, unpredictability, public scrutiny, or the realities of life outside celebrity circles.During a lighthearted promotional event, Branson attempted to stop pedestrians for quick interviews. Despite his global reputation, most passersby ignored him, hurrying along as though he were just another stranger with a microphone.The unusual moment, filmed by entrepreneur Simon Squibb, quickly gained traction on Instagram, showing the tycoon facing rejection after rejection.This unexpected moment wasn’t just a publicity stunt; it was part of a campaign to promote “Doorbell of Dreams.” The initiative, launched by Branson in partnership with Squibb’s startup HelpBnk, invites everyday dreamers to pitch their business ideas in under 60 seconds.What makes the concept unique is its accessibility. Through a specially designed video doorbell, aspiring entrepreneurs can present their ideas, with the hope of receiving mentorship, guidance, or even investment. Originally launched in the UK, the project recently expanded to New York, where Virgin Hotels partnered as a venue for participants. The street interviews were meant to spark curiosity among locals and draw attention to the campaign.The video shows Branson politely approaching strangers with the question, “Can I ask you a question?” But instead of engaging, most people brushed him off. One woman walked by without so much as a glance, while another looked briefly at him before rushing away, clearly preoccupied with her own thoughts, errands, and smartphone notifications, unaware of the rare opportunity to interact with a global icon.For a man who has conquered industries from airlines to space travel, being ignored on the sidewalk was a rare and humbling experience, highlighting the ordinary challenges everyone faces. Squibb, amused by the scene, remarked, “A bit of rejection is healthy.” Branson laughed at himself and replied, “I’m not doing too well, am I?” Eventually, a passerby did agree to share his dream, stating his goal was to achieve financial independence, help others, and contribute positively to the world in meaningful, impactful ways.Once uploaded, the clip drew widespread attention on social media. Many users were stunned that a man of Branson’s stature could blend so seamlessly into the crowd. One viewer commented, “Richard Branson getting rejected? Unbelievable!” Another wrote, “Imagine ignoring one of the world’s most inspirational entrepreneurs who’s just asking you a simple question.”The rejections, however, were not seen as embarrassing but rather refreshing. Viewers praised Branson’s good-natured attitude and willingness to step into unfamiliar situations despite his status. A popular comment read, “This is what humility looks like. Sir Richard Branson has every reason to stay in his comfort zone, but he still pushes himself.”","Billionaire Richard Branson ignored on NYC streets while promoting ‘Doorbell of Dreams’ While promoting his latest initiative, the 75-year-old tycoon tried stopping passersby for quick interviews.

"UAE cuts interest rates after US Fed’s decision: What it means for your loans, savings, and investments",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-cuts-interest-rates-after-us-feds-decision-what-it-means-for-your-loans-savings-and-investments/articleshow/123965156.cms,"The UAE lowered its key interest rate by 25 basis points to 4.15%, following the US Federal Reserve’s recent cut

UAE mirrors US Fed's rate cut

Impact on borrowing costs, sectoral outlook

Real Estate: Falling mortgage rates may reignite demand in Dubai’s property market, especially among first-time buyers and investors seeking leveraged exposure.



Retail and Tourism: Lower interest rates can boost disposable income and spur consumer demand, supporting domestic consumption and inbound travel.



SMEs and Corporates: Easier access to cheaper financing may encourage business expansion, especially for small and medium enterprises and capital-intensive industries.





Why the UAE Dirham is pegged to USD





What is a currency peg?





Reduced exchange rate risk in trade and investment



Greater price stability in imported goods



Enhanced investor confidence due to currency predictability





Behind the Fed's move

Slowing job gains



A slight uptick in the unemployment rate, although it remains relatively low



Moderated economic growth in the first half of 2025



Elevated inflation, particularly in core categories









In a significant shift aligned with the US Federal Reserve’s latest monetary policy easing, the Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE) has reduced its base interest rate by 25 basis points to 4.15%, effective September 18, 2025. The rate cut marks the UAE’s response to changing global economic signals and is expected to lower borrowing costs, potentially stimulating sectors like real estate, tourism, and small business growth, while also impacting savings and investment preferences.On September 18, 2025, the Central Bank of the UAE lowered the Base Rate applicable to the Overnight Deposit Facility (ODF) by 25 basis points, from 4.40% to 4.15%. This move directly followed the US Federal Reserve’s decision the previous day to reduce its Interest Rate on Reserve Balances (IORB) by the same margin.The UAE’s base rate, which serves as a floor for overnight money market interest rates, is anchored to the Fed’s IORB. Given the UAE dirham’s long-standing peg to the US dollar, changes in US interest rates are typically mirrored in the Emirates to maintain monetary stability.In addition to adjusting the base rate, the CBUAE announced that it would maintain the spread for borrowing short-term liquidity from the central bank at 50 basis points above the base rate across all standing credit facilities.This is the first interest rate cut in the UAE since the Fed’s last policy shift in December 2024, when rates were reduced to a range of 4.25%–4.50%. With the current adjustment, the Fed’s target federal funds rate now stands at 4.00%–4.25%, the lowest level since November 2022.The UAE’s rate cut is expected to translate into lower borrowing costs, with wide-ranging implications for consumer spending, business investment, and credit activity.Key sectors likely to benefit:Conversely, traditional savers and fixed-income investors may feel the downside. Returns on fixed deposits and bonds are likely to decline, pushing individuals and institutions toward riskier asset classes such as equities or real estate.Stock markets, especially those rich in growth and dividend-paying companies, are expected to benefit from the rate environment, although volatility may persist due to lingering global macroeconomic uncertainties.The UAE’s monetary policy is heavily influenced by its currency peg to the US dollar, a regime that has been in place since 1997. The exchange rate has been fixed at 1 USD = 3.6725 AED, offering a stable foundation for trade, investment, and macroeconomic planning.The peg plays a crucial role in simplifying oil trade transactions, given that oil exports are globally priced in US dollars. This alignment shields the UAE from exchange rate volatility and enhances confidence among international investors.A currency peg, or fixed exchange rate, is a mechanism by which a country’s central bank maintains its currency’s value at a constant rate against a foreign currency or a basket of currencies. The primary benefits include:As of 2024, 12 countries peg their currencies to the US dollar, with the UAE being one of the most prominent examples in the Middle East.Because of this peg, monetary policy independence in the UAE is limited. The Central Bank typically aligns its interest rate decisions with the Fed to maintain the stability of the peg and prevent capital flight or currency arbitrage.The US Federal Reserve’s rate cut on September 17, 2025, was its first of the year, driven by growing signs of a cooling labor market and persistent political pressures, including tariff-related inflationary concerns.According to the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), recent economic data pointed to:The Fed emphasized that further policy adjustments will be contingent on incoming data, the evolving economic outlook, and risk assessments. This suggests a cautious but flexible approach to monetary easing in the months ahead.","The Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE) has reduced its base interest rate by 25 basis points to 4.15%, effective September 18, 2025.

JD Vance hosts 'The Charlie Kirk Show': US VP lashes out at liberals; recalls Erika’s tribute,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/jd-vance-hosts-the-charlie-kirk-show-us-vp-lashes-out-at-liberals-recalls-erikas-tribute/articleshow/123911323.cms,"Trump Unleashes Crackdown After Kirk’s Murder: Visa Bans, Mass Firings, Military Probes Sweep US





US Vice-President JD Vance has said that national unity is impossible with people who celebrate the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk , warning that such behaviour fuels further political violence.Speaking as guest host of The Charlie Kirk Show on Monday, Vance said: “Call them out, and hell, call their employer. We don't believe in political violence, but we do believe in civility.”The vice-president took over presenting duties from his ceremonial office at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, with the programme livestreamed into the White House press briefing room. It was the first episode of the podcast since Kirk, 31, was fatally shot in the neck while moderating a debate at Utah Valley University last week.Vance, who flew Kirk’s body home to Arizona aboard Air Force Two, said he was “filling in for somebody who cannot be filled in for”. He recounted conversations with Kirk’s widow Erika, describing him as “a kind, loving husband”, and admitted her words had inspired him to “be a better husband and… a better father”.In his remarks, Vance directly challenged those making light of Kirk’s assassination. “There is no unity with the people who celebrate Charlie Kirk's assassination,” he said.“There is no unity with someone who lies about what Charlie Kirk said in order to excuse his murder… And there is no unity with the people who fund these articles, who pay the salaries of these terrorist sympathisers who argue that Charlie Kirk, a loving husband and father, deserved a shot to the neck because he spoke words with which they disagree. ”He added: “I’m desperate for our country to be united in condemnation of the actions and the ideas that killed my friend. I want it so badly that I will tell you a difficult truth. We can only have it with people who acknowledge that political violence is unacceptable.”Other Republicans have echoed calls for accountability. Florida congressman Randy Fine said he would “demand their firing, defunding, and licence revocation”, while South Carolina’s Nancy Mace urged federal funding to be cut from universities that refuse to act.Vance, who described Kirk as a close friend and mentor, credited him with helping President Donald Trump’s re-election and with shaping the administration. “If it weren't for Charlie Kirk, I would not be the vice president of the United States,” he said.","US Vice-President JD Vance said national unity is impossible with people who celebrate the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

The Trucial States and British Control: Foundations of UAE National Day





1820–1853: A series of treaties were signed between Britain and the ruling sheikhs, starting with the defeat of the Qawasim maritime force. These agreements aimed to curb maritime conflict, prohibit the construction of warships or coastal fortifications, and maintain peace at sea.

1853: The Perpetual Maritime Truce formalized an indefinite end to hostilities at sea. Britain limited its role to maritime security without interfering in the internal governance of the emirates.

1892: The Exclusive Agreements prohibited the Trucial States from engaging with foreign powers without British approval. In exchange, the UK pledged military protection against external threats.



Path to federation: Early steps toward UAE National Day





February 18, 1968: Sheikh Zayed met with Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum of Dubai at Al Samha . They agreed to unite their emirates and invite others to join, forming the first step toward regional federation — the Union Accord.



They agreed to collaborate on foreign affairs, defense, security, social services, and immigration policy. Judicial and internal governance would remain under individual emirate control.

The proposed Federation of the Arab Emirates was based on 11 foundational principles including mutual respect for sovereignty, unified foreign policy, and joint developmental goals. A Supreme Council was to be established to oversee federal legislation and policy, with decisions requiring unanimous consent.

December 2 marks a pivotal moment in the history of the United Arab Emirates — the day it became an independent, sovereign nation in 1971. But the choice of this date was not symbolic alone; it was the culmination of decades of treaties, negotiations, British withdrawal, and a shared vision among the region's leaders. This is the detailed story of how the UAE came to be, why December 2 became its National Day, and the constitutional foundations that shaped the Federation.The territory that is now the UAE was historically known as the Trucial States, a group of independent emirates along the southern coast of the Persian Gulf. British involvement in the region began in the early 19th century:British control over the region intensified in the mid-20th century, largely driven by oil exploration and geopolitical interests. They controlled oil concession grants and intervened in territorial disputes to secure exploration zones, including helping define inter-emirate boundaries in the 1950s.However, by 1968, economic constraints pushed the UK to announce a full military and political withdrawal from the Gulf by end of 1971. This move set off a chain of political activity among the Trucial States’ rulers to form a new, self-governed entity before the British departure.The initiative to form a unified state began with Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, who became Ruler of Abu Dhabi in 1966. Seeing the necessity of regional cooperation, he envisioned a federation that could unify resources and political will.Despite this progress, Bahrain and Qatar opted for independent statehood in August and September 1971, respectively.As the British exit approached, six emirates — Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm Al Quwain, and Fujairah — committed to forming a new union.The Supreme Council of Rulers, composed of the Rulers of each emirate, became the highest federal authority. Decisions would require a majority vote — with both Abu Dhabi and Dubai needed to be part of the majority for any decision to pass.Article 138 specifically enabled the unification of the UAE Armed Forces under federal command, ensuring centralized defense policy and organization.Several shared factors helped facilitate a smooth transition to federation:Immediately after its formation, the UAE began establishing itself as a credible state in the international community:","December 2 marks the UAE’s formation, uniting seven emirates into a strong, independent federation.

The Wall Street Journal





WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump on Sunday teased what he called a “very important” announcement on autism, fuelling speculation about a fresh controversy over health claims.Speaking at a memorial event for conservative activist Charlie Kirk in Arizona, Trump told the audience, “I think we found an answer to autism,” calling the forthcoming disclosure “one of the most important things that we will do.”He repeated the remark, saying it would be a “very important announcement,” but declined to elaborate, promising to discuss solutions in the Oval Office.The comments came a day after Trump said the planned revelation would rank among his administration’s top priorities. The president’s remarks have triggered renewed debate as his health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, has previously courted criticism for promoting unproven links between autism and certain medicines.Earlier this month,reported that Kennedy was preparing to announce a potential link between the use of Tylenol during pregnancy and autism spectrum disorder, a neurodevelopmental condition marked by social and communication difficulties and repetitive behaviors.Trump, Kennedy have in the past suggested connections between autism, vaccines and other medications despite a lack of scientific evidence. Health experts and researchers have consistently rejected such claims as unfounded and potentially harmful.","US President Donald Trump on Sunday teased what he called a “very important” announcement on autism.

This is an umbrella arrangement offered to one another by both sides: if there is aggression against either party - from any side - it will be jointly defended, and the aggression will be met with a response. "" He added that it was not an ""aggressive pact"" but a defensive arrangement, similar to that of Nato.Asif said that Pakistan had always offered its nuclear facilities for inspection and never committed any violation.Asked whether US was taken into confidence on the matter, Asif said he felt there was ""no ground or justification"" for any other third party to be involved in the development. ""This agreement will not be a hegemonic arrangement... We don't have any plans to conquer territory or attack anyone. But our fundamental right can't be denied to us and we exercised that yesterday (Wednesday),"" Asif said.Asif also said the protection of the holy Islamic sites in Saudi Arabia was also a matter of ""sacred duty"" for Pakistan.To a question about terrorist attacks on security forces, Asif reiterated Pakistani claims that Afghan soil was being used to stage acts of terrorism in the country. ""We were swept into two wars in Afghanistan. The US, on both occasions, left the region and we are still dealing with the consequences, be it the Taliban, the TTP (Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan), the BLA (Balochistan Liberation Army), or anyone else,"" Asif said. When asked if Arab states would act in response to Afghan aggression, the Pakistan defence minister said he would not be against it.International Atomic Energy Agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment over the Pakistan defence minister's remarks. Asif criticised Israel in the interview for not fully disclosing its suspected nuclear weapons programme to IAEA. Israel, too, has not commented on the two nations' mutual defence pact. Pakistani Brig Gen. Feroz Hassan Khan (retd) has said Saudi Arabia provided ""generous financial support to Pakistan that enabled the nuclear programme to continue, especially when the country was under sanctions"".

At least 11 people were killed in two separate blasts in Pakistan’s restive Balochistan province on Friday, officials said, underscoring the growing wave of militancy in the mineral-rich region bordering Afghanistan and Iran.A suicide bomber rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into a convoy of paramilitary soldiers in Dasht, near the Iranian border, killing five people, including three troops, according to two local government officials who spoke to AFP. The separatist Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for the attack.In a separate incident the same evening, a blast near an Afghan border crossing killed six labourers, local official Imtiaz Ali Baloch told AFP. No group immediately claimed responsibility for that attack. Baloch istan has long been a flashpoint for violence, with separatist groups waging a decade-long insurgency against the Pakistani state, alleging exploitation of local resources and discrimination against the Baloch people. The military has responded with a sweeping counter-terrorism campaign, which rights groups say has involved enforced disappearances and arbitrary detentions.Earlier this month, 15 people were killed in a suicide bombing claimed by the Islamic State group at a political rally in the provincial capital, Quetta.","A suicide bomber rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into a convoy of paramilitary soldiers in Dasht, near the Iranian border, killing five people, including three troops.

More Than 150,000 Evacuated in Pakistan Punjab After India’s Flood Alert

Relief in Jalalpur Pirwala, Alipur

Waters recede, but threat not over

Fields and cattle lost





Even as floodwaters began to recede in parts of south Punjab, the scale of destruction remains staggering, nearly 2.5 million people have been forced to flee their homes and at least 101 lives have been lost, the Dawn reported.The Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) has called the ongoing evacuation and relief drive one of the largest in recent memory. More than 1,500 boats were deployed to rescue stranded families, with 12,427 people evacuated from villages along the Chenab, Ravi and Sutlej rivers.Multan, Muzaffargarh and Rahim Yar Khan districts bore the brunt of the floods. Entire villages were submerged — including the union council of Lati Mari in Alipur tehsil, home to 40,000 people.“Nearly 15,000 people from our basti had to leave on their own as water rose,” said Syed Kausar Shah, a local resident. “Homes and crops were destroyed, and people escaped on a hired boat. Some now live in relief camps, others under the open sky.” He added that two villagers drowned while attempting to flee.Officials declared Jalalpur Pirwala and Alipur tehsils safe after a major flood wave passed through Head Panjnad.Multan Deputy Commissioner Waseem Hamid Sindhu confirmed that 100,000 people had been evacuated from Jalalpur Pirwala alone in three days.Breaches in Shujabad and Jalalpur Pirwala are now being filled, while helicopters and drones drop food and medicine into cut-off areas. Boats continue to ferry supplies into rural belts.At a press briefing in Bahawalpur, PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said Panjnad Headworks still faced a “high flood” but levels had dropped from 700,000 cusecs earlier this week to 575,000 cusecs on Saturday. By evening, the Flood Forecasting Division reported further decline to 492,695 cusecs.“There is no threat to Jalalpur Pirwala and Alipur cities,” Kathia assured, adding that water in Bahawalpur would also recede within 24 hours. He called the scale of evacuation “historic,” stressing that Multan could have faced forced evacuations if operations were delayed.According to official data, 4,447 mouzas across 28 districts have been inundated. Alongside the mass displacement of people, more than 2.19 million cattle were rescued and shifted to higher ground.For now, the rivers appear to be calming, the Sutlej at Ganda Singh Wala was recorded at 95,000 cusecs, categorised as medium flood.

Protests Erupt in Pakistan, as Imran Khan Supporters Call for His Release

The sons of jailed former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said their father “will not be broken” by his “unlawful” imprisonment, as his legal team lodged an appeal with the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture.The elder son, Sulaiman Khan, condemned Khan's treatment in a statement attached to the appeal:Our father is being kept in conditions that no human being should endure. These are violations of his rights, and they amount to torture.”The younger son, Kasim Khan, said:The UN has already recognised that our father’s imprisonment is arbitrary and unlawful. What he is enduring now shows how far the regime will go to break him. But he will not be broken.”Sulaiman and Kasim are the cricketer-turned-politician’s sons with British filmmaker Jemima Goldsmith, with whom he was married for nine years until 2004. They live in the UK with Goldsmith.The appeal, filed by the US-based law firm Perseus Strategies on behalf of Khan’s legal team, alleged a “systematic pattern of abuse, including prolonged solitary confinement, denial of medical care, contaminated food, and restricted access to legal counsel and family visits.”His lawyers argued that these conditions breach Pakistan’s obligations under the UN Convention against Torture (CAT) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). They urged the UN to press authorities to safeguard the former PM’s physical and mental well-being.Khan has been in prison since August 2023 after being charged in multiple cases.","The sons of jailed former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said their father “will not be broken” by his “unlawful” imprisonment.

Aid meant for relief diverted? Pakistan funding reconstruction of LeT HQ destroyed in Op Sindoor; what intel says,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/aid-meant-for-relief-diverted-pakistan-funding-reconstruction-of-let-hq-destroyed-in-op-sindoor-what-intel-says/articleshow/123878923.cms,"Intel Reveals Pak Using Aid To Rebuild LeT HQ Hit In Op Sindoor, Experts Say ‘Time To Strike Again’

Poll Do you believe the reconstruction of LeT's Markaz Taiba is a threat to regional security? Yes, it poses a significant threat. No, it will not impact security.

How India destroyed LeT HQ



Why its reconstruction is a matter of concern?







Pakistan is financing the reconstruction of Lashkar-e-Taiba’s (LeT) Muridke headquarters, Markaz Taiba, which was destroyed in precision airstrikes during Operation Sindoor on May 7. According to ANI, citing an agency dossier, LeT has launched fundraising campaigns under the pretext of flood relief to support the redevelopment project.Moreover, Islamabad has already allocated PKR 4 crore, though the group estimates costs at over PKR 15 crore. The dossier stated that its army and ISI remain involved in sustaining and reviving LeT.Senior commanders Maulana Abu Zar and Yunus Shah Bukhari are overseeing the project, due by February 2026, mirroring past cases where LeT diverted humanitarian aid, including most of the 2005 earthquake relief, to militant infrastructure.This comes amidst Pakistan's continuous assertions on global platforms that it was combating terrorism.The Indian Air Force (IAF), earlier this year, showcased the extensive damage caused to LeT Muridke headquarters during Operation Sindoor, highlighting the precision and reach of the strikes.Muridke, home to LeT’s Markaz Taiba, was identified as a critical target. The strikes hit senior leadership residential areas and office buildings where commanders convened for planning and operations.The IAF showed videos captured directly from the weapons, pointing out the level of devastation within the complex.The airstrikes reportedly killed around a dozen high-value terrorists, including Yusuf Azhar, the IC-814 hijacker, Abu Jundal (also known as Mudassar), the Muridke chief of LeT, and the son of the planner of the 2016 Nagrota attack. The operation, conducted in retaliation for the Pahalgam killings, reinforced India’s ability to carry out precise, high-impact missions inside enemy territory.The ongoing reconstruction of LeT Markaz Taiba headquarters has raised serious concerns regarding regional security, given the facility’s central role in training and radicalizing terrorists. Established in 2000, the complex serves as both a residence for senior commanders and a training ground where recruits are instructed in intelligence gathering, arms handling, and other operational skills. Analysts warn that reviving the facility could strengthen LeT’s operational capabilities and enable the recruitment of new militants.Markaz Taiba functions as the “alma mater” of LeT, providing courses that combine physical and arms training with ideological indoctrination. The center attracts recruits from within Pakistan and abroad, using religious and radicalization programs to cultivate loyalty and operational skills among future militants. Its facilities, including a mosque and guest house financed by Osama bin Laden, underscore the longstanding support the organization has received from international terror networks.The scale of the operation at Markaz Taiba further amplifies the threat. The facility reportedly trains around 1,000 students annually, preparing them for operational roles within LeT. Past evidence has shown that graduates of this center have gone on to participate in high-profile attacks, including the 26/11 Mumbai attacks, highlighting the direct link between the facility and acts of cross-border terrorism targeting India.LeT’s historical connection with Pakistan’s intelligence apparatus adds another layer of concern. Senior commanders at the facility, including those who oversaw training for the 26/11 perpetrators, have operated under the guidance of the ISI.","Pakistan is financing the reconstruction of Lashkar-e-Taiba’s (LeT) Muridke headquarters, Markaz Taiba.

A British couple, who were detained in Afghanistan earlier this year, have been freed after the Qatari-mediated negotiations.Barbie Reynolds, 76, and her husband Peter, 80, were taken into custody by the Taliban’s interior ministry on February 1 and moved to a maximum-security prison in Kabul in March, AP reported.The couple have lived in Afghanistan for 18 years, running “Rebuild,” an organisation providing education and training programmes. Together since the 1960s, they married in Kabul in 1970.""Two British nationals named Peter and Barbara Reynolds, who had violated the laws of Afghanistan, were released from custody today following the judicial process,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Abdul Qahar Balkhi said on social media.He added that the government ""does not view the matters of citizens from a political or transactional angle"".“God is good, as they say in Afghanistan,” Barbie Reynolds said after she arrived at Kabul International Airport to fly out of the country.The Reynolds’ family members in the U.K. repeatedly called for the couple’s release, saying they were being mistreated and held on undisclosed charges. While the Taliban rejected the abuse allegations, they have never explained what prompted their detention, AP reported.“This is a moment of immense joy for our family, and we are deeply thankful to everyone who played a role in securing their release,” the family said in a statement after their release, mentioning Qatar and the British governments.“This experience has reminded us of the power of diplomacy, empathy, and international co-operation. While the road to recovery will be long as our parents regain their health and spend time with their family, today is a day of tremendous joy and relief.”Their son Jonathan told Sky News in April his parents had ""never heard one accusation or one charge"". He said the British govt had offered to evacuate them when the Taliban took over, to which they replied: ""Why would we leave these people in their darkest hour?Qatar, an energy-rich nation on the Arabian Peninsula that mediated talks between the U.S. and the Taliban before the American withdrawal, assisted in releasing the Reynolds couple from Afghanistan, a diplomat said. The couple left Afghanistan on Friday. The diplomat spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive negotiations involved in the case.Earlier this month, the Taliban said they had reached an agreement with US envoys on a prisoner exchange as part of an effort to normalise relations. The meeting came after the Taliban in March released US citizen George Glezmann, who was abducted while travelling through Afghanistan as a tourist. Afghanistan remains a focus of US President Donald Trump. On Thursday, while visiting the UK, Trump suggested that he was working to reestablish a US presence at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan. Zakir Jalaly, an official at the Taliban’s Foreign Ministry, dismissed the idea.Reynolds couple were flown to Doha and are now on their way home to be reunited with their family.","Barbie Reynolds, 76, and her husband Peter, 80, were taken into custody by the Taliban’s interior ministry on February 1 and moved to a maximum-security prison in Kabul in March.

Today is Constitution Day — the day the Nepali people, after 70 years of struggle, saw the constitution enacted by the

Constituent Assembly

they themselves had elected. It is the day when a democratic republic, a federal inclusive system, and the rights of the people were established.

The challenges we faced while drafting this constitution are still fresh in your memory. Even overcoming blockades and threats to the country’s

sovereignty

, the constitution was promulgated. Therefore, Nepal’s constitution is a blueprint for the future that the Nepali people have written for themselves.

After the constitution was enacted, we were building transport structures connecting north and south to make the landlocked country accessible and resilient against blockades. We had also signed transport agreements with our northern neighbor and were expanding the strength of our sovereignty. We were laying the foundations for development structures and the economy was growing steadily.

Last week, during what was supposed to be a peaceful Jan Gatha (Jan-G) protest, intruders entered — as the organizers themselves had claimed. Conspirators who infiltrated caused violence, resulting in the deaths of our youth. The government had not ordered the demonstrators to be fired upon. The investigation must determine how automatic weapons, which the police did not possess, were used. I again express my grief over the incident, pay tribute to the deceased youth, and wish speedy recovery to the injured.

At this moment, our constitution is under a major attack. After my resignation from the position of Prime Minister, Singha Durbar was set on fire — the map of Nepal was burned, and the national symbol was targeted for erasure. Offices of public representatives, courts, business institutions, political party offices, the homes of leaders and activists, and personal property were systematically destroyed.

I will not speak much today about the

conspiracy

behind this; time itself will reveal many truths. Was our country truly being destroyed, or was anger being stirred up merely through fabricated narratives of destruction? Our new generation will realize this for themselves. Society that once criticized the crowds at airports will, in time, understand what it means when external movement is blocked. Our new generation will come to understand all of this.

However, this is something that must be understood now; if not, our country’s sovereignty will exist only in history.

Our youth must have read the history of Bhim Malla’s death sentence. Bhim Malla, after expanding the country’s borders and returning, was executed upon his return, leaving only regret as the option. Outcomes of discontent fueled beyond reality only serve as lessons in regret, and such regret will deepen the memory of the nation being built.

All Nepalis across generations must unite — to face attacks on our sovereignty and defend our constitution. Sovereignty is our existence, and the constitution is the armor of our freedom. Only our unity can lift and protect the country from this unimaginable crisis.

I appeal to everyone —

Let us protect the constitution, let us defend our sovereignty.

Nepal In Flames: PM KP Oli Resigns, Flees In Army Chopper As Gen Z Protesters Burn Down Parliament





Days after massive unrest upended Nepal’s political situation, deposed Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has shifted from army protection to a private residence. According to news agency PTI, citing Nepal army sources, Oli spent nine days under army security before moving out.Oli had flown to an army barracks -- believed to be in the Shivapuri forest area, north of Kathmandu on September 9, immediately after the Gen Z-led protests turned violent and he resigned as Prime Minister.After nine days in army security, the chairman of the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist–Leninist) (CPN-UML) relocated to a private location, the Nepal Army confirmed.However, his current address has not been officially disclosed. Media reports indicate that Oli has shifted to a private house in the Gundu area of Bhaktapur district, about 15 km east of Kathmandu.During the second day of the protests on September 9, Gen Z demonstrators burned Oli’s house in Balkot, Bhaktapur, to ashes. On the same day, while Oli was at the official residence of the Nepal Prime Minister, protesters also partially torched the Prime Minister’s Office in Balkot. He was safely evacuated by a Nepal Army helicopter.Several other senior political figures -- including former Prime Ministers Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda,’ Sher Bahadur Deuba, Jhalanath Khanal, Madhav Kumar Nepal, and others -- had also taken shelter under army protection for a few days. At present, only Nepali Congress president Sher Bahadur Deuba and his spouse, former foreign minister Arzju Rana Deuba, remain under army security. The couple sustained injuries during the protests and are currently receiving hospital treatment under military protection.Meanwhile, the CPN-UML, led by Oli, is planning a separate event to mark Constitution Day on September 19 at Chyasal in Lalitpur district, where the party’s central office is located. However, it remains uncertain whether Oli will attend the programme.Nepal will observe Constitution Day on Ashoj 3 of the Bikram Era calendar—September 19 this year—marking the promulgation of the country’s constitution drafted by the Constituent Assembly on September 20, 2015.The Nepal government is organising a grand celebration in Kathmandu on September 19 to mark Constitution Day and has declared a public holiday for the occasion. President Ramchandra Paudel, Prime Minister Sushila Karki, the Nepal army chief, ministers and other dignitaries are scheduled to attend.","Deposed PM KP Sharma Oli has shifted from army protection to a private residence.

Nepal protesters delete social media presence as police probe closes in,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/nepal-protesters-delete-social-media-presence-as-police-probe-closes-in/articleshow/123984686.cms,"Nepal Lifts Social Media Ban Following Deadly Protests





With Nepal slowly regaining normalcy after the deadly Sept 8-9 protests that left more than 70 people dead, police have turned their focus to identifying those behind the violence. The crackdown has triggered a 'digital retreat' among many protesters, who are deleting social media accounts or going silent online to avoid detection.Nepal police said they have received nearly 30,000 emails from citizens containing photos and videos that document arson, looting, and attacks on public buildings. The evidence was submitted after an appeal by police urging people to share digital material pertaining to the protests while promising not to disclose the identity of the senders to ensure their safety.DIG Binod Ghimire, spokesperson of Nepal police, said the huge volume of citizen responses received would aid the investigation. ""The videos and photos that we have got from citizens will help us track down those involved in the violence. We will analyse the data and act accordingly. We urge people to share more evidence, if any.""His statement came amid another appeal by Kathmandu police cautioning people against buying looted items.During the protests, many had looted valuables from banks, supermarkets, jewellery shops and other business establishments. Some perpetrators had also looted weapons and other items from police stations across the country.Earlier on Wednesday, ministers of the newly-formed interim govt visited the federal parliament building to assess the destruction. Rameshwor Prasad Khanal, the interim finance minister, said: ""The damage to properties is extensive across the country. We are assessing the loss after which necessary action would be taken to repair or rebuild properties. Our PM has already said that the vandalism and arson was a criminal act which will be punished. Police are therefore working towards bringing the perpetrators to justice.""Meanwhile, in Kathmandu, the sense of unease is palpable, especially among younger residents. Many say the fear of being linked to the unrest has changed everyday routines. ""Youngsters are now not just hesitant to come out of their homes but have also deleted their social media accounts,"" said Prashant Shrestha, who runs a souvenir shop in Thamel. ""There's fear of being identified for the loot and vandalism that caused so much loss to both public and private property. ""Ram Bahadur Chhetri, 64, a retired govt employee, termed the vandalism as a 'brainless act' while demanding strict action against perpetrators. ""Our country had somehow managed to get back on its feet after the 2015 earthquake . Now, again some people under the garb of protests against corruption, caused unforgettable damage. It will take years for us to cope with this loss,"" said Chhetri.","Nepal police have received nearly 30,000 emails from citizens containing photos and videos that document arson, looting, and attacks on public buildings.

Putin Warns UK Against Interference In Ukraine Truce Negotiations | Watch





UK secret intelligence service chief Richard Moore on Friday said there is “absolutely no evidence” that Russian President Vladimir Putin is willing to negotiate peace in Ukraine, accusing him of deceiving the world with false promises of dialogue.In a parting speech at the British consulate in Istanbul, Moore said Putin was “stringing us along” while seeking to impose his “imperial will by all means at his disposal.” “Bluntly, Putin has bitten off more than he can chew. He thought he was going to win an easy victory, but he – and many others – underestimated the Ukrainians,” Moore said.Moore warned that the Russian leader is “mortgaging his country’s future for his own personal legacy and a distorted version of history,” adding that the war is accelerating Russia’s decline.The head of Britain’s secret intelligence service, will retire in September this year after serving five years in the role. He will be preceded by UK's first woman intelligence officer, Blaise Metreweli.Moore, a former UK ambassador to Turkey, said the 2022 invasion had backfired on Moscow by strengthening Ukrainian national identity, speeding Kyiv’s westward shift, and prompting Sweden and Finland to join NATO. “Putin has sought to convince the world that Russian victory is inevitable. But he lies. He lies to the world. He lies to his people. Perhaps he even lies to himself,” Moore told reporters.The Ukraine conflict, now in its third year, continues to rage primarily in the country’s east, with tens of thousands killed since Russia’s full-scale invasion began in February 2022.","Richard Moore, head of Britain's secret intelligence service, will retire in September this year.

‘Do As I Say Or…’: Trump Loses Temper At NATO Nations Buying Russian Oil; Warns Them To Stop…





US President Donald Trump claimed that the UK Prime Minister supported his criticism of NATO and EU countries over their continued energy purchases from Russia, despite the West’s broader stance on sanctions, calling it a key obstacle to achieving peace in Ukraine.Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on his return to Washington after a state visit to the United Kingdom, Trump said, “The UK Prime Minister was embarrassed about me calling out NATO and EU countries over buying oil from Russia. And he said that’s not good. He appreciated that I said it, but he said that’s not good. How about that?”Trump further stated that the UK PM Keir Starmer expressed willingness to take action on the issue. “He also agrees to stop buying oil from Russia, and he’s willing to impose sanctions too. And he’s not one of the culprits in terms of Russian oil,”Trump added.The remarks appear to underline ongoing tensions over Europe's energy dependence on Russia, which has remained a point of friction between Washington and several NATO allies. While Trump's comments suggest some level of private consensus with the UK on the issue, there has been no official confirmation yet from Downing Street regarding any new commitments.He reiterated his belief that cutting off Russian oil exports is essential to bringing an end to the war in Ukraine. “Ultimately, if oil prices go down, or if Russia is not selling oil, they have no choice but to settle. When EU or Nato nations are buying oil from Russia, that’s not the greatest thing,” he said.Trump also admitted that the conflict in Ukraine has proven more complex than he had initially expected. He said he felt “let down” by Russian President Vladimir Putin, despite earlier confidence in their personal rapport to help negotiate a peace deal.Trump has consistently criticised Nato and EU nations for what he sees as a contradiction - relying on US defence support while continuing economic ties with Russia through energy trade.(With inputs from agencies)",US President Donald Trump claimed that the UK Prime Minister supported his criticism of NATO and EU countries over their continued energy purchases from Russia.

EU Chief Kaja Kallas To India: Rethink Moscow Ties Or Risk Free Trade Agreement With European Union





The UK has carried out its first deportation under a new returns treaty with France, with home secretary Shabana Mehmood calling it an “important first step” in efforts to curb illegal English Channel crossings.“This is an important first step to securing our borders. It sends a message to people crossing in small boats: if you enter the UK illegally, we will seek to remove you,” Mehmood said Thursday. She added that the government would continue to challenge “last-minute, vexatious” attempts in court, and stressed that Britain would continue to provide refuge through “safe, legal and managed routes — not dangerous crossings. ”According to UK home office sources, the deportee is an Indian national who crossed into Britain illegally on a small boat in August. He was flown on a commercial flight to Paris under the “one-in, one-out” deal signed with France. Once returned, he will be offered a voluntary repatriation scheme to India; refusal would bar him from applying for asylum and could result in enforced removal.The pilot agreement, which began in August and will run until June 2026, allows the UK to deport migrants who arrive illegally while accepting an equal number from France through a new safe and legal asylum pathway, subject to strict eligibility and security checks.The first arrivals under this reciprocal route are expected in Britain in the coming days.Official data show that 2,715 Indian nationals were in UK immigration detention as of August — more than double last year’s figure, an increase of 108 per cent. The deported man is among the first group of migrants held by UK Border Force since the treaty came into force.According to the home office, more than 35,000 people with no right to remain were removed from the UK in the past year, with returns of foreign criminals up 14 per cent and asylum-related removals up 28 per cent.","The deportee is an Indian national who crossed into Britain illegally on a small boat in August.

Charles plays the statesman



The transactional monarchist



Murdoch at the margins



Fortress walls and protest shadows



The bigger picture: Royals as Britain’s bargaining chip

Bottom Line







When Donald Trump strode into Windsor Castle this week in white tie, flanked by King Charles III and Queen Camilla, it wasn’t just another state dinner. It was Britain’s oldest political trick—deploying the monarchy as a velvet glove to soften a hard negotiation. The soaring banquet hall, filled with nearly a thousand years of heraldry, wasn’t just a backdrop; it was a stage. Every polished suit of armour and gilded goblet was calculated to make Trump feel not just welcomed, but enthroned.For Britain, the stakes were high. With Trump’s second term already marked by tariffs, transactional diplomacy, and the unraveling of Western alliances, London needed leverage. The royal family, still Britain’s most effective soft power tool, provided it.Unlike the star-studded dinners of yesteryears—think Hollywood names or fashion royalty—this banquet was stocked with people who wield real influence. At the 160-seat table were Wall Street titans like Blackstone’s Stephen Schwarzman and Bank of America’s Brian Moynihan, tech heavyweights like Sam Altman, Demis Hassabis, Satya Nadella, Marc Benioff, and Apple’s Tim Cook, plus media barons like Rupert Murdoch.The symbolism was obvious: Britain wanted Trump to see that its royals could convene a pantheon of the global elite in his honour. The message—this is the club you still belong to, provided you play nice with us.Tim Cook’s presence was particularly striking. Barely weeks ago, he was in Trump’s bad books for skipping a Middle East trip. Yet here he was, seated beside Tiffany Trump, as if the Windsor seating chart itself was an act of reconciliation.King Charles used his toast to strike a balance—lavishing praise on Anglo-American friendship, while inserting subtle nudges about climate and Ukraine. The king knows Trump’s views on both issues are, at best, sceptical. But the gentle prod, wrapped in regal ceremony, seemed unlikely to provoke the famously thin-skinned president.Trump, for his part, basked in the flattery. He declared himself “the first American president welcomed here,” conveniently overlooking his own previous Windsor visit and the fact that past presidents had dined at Buckingham Palace. Accuracy mattered less than optics. In that moment, Trump was both guest and monarch, enjoying the rarest of British honours: being feted in a castle that has survived every empire from the Normans to the Nazis.Trump is not sentimental about monarchy. But he is sentimental about status. For a man who relishes gilded interiors, gold-plated trophies, and long tables of power, Windsor was the ultimate backdrop. Britain knows this. The castle setting was a calculated bet: flatter the president’s sense of grandeur, and he might be more pliable when it comes to trade talks or military cooperation.Downing Street, led by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, clearly coordinated with the palace. By seating Trump amid billionaires, bankers, and AI moguls, Britain showed it could still marshal global capital and innovation in ways that appeal to Trump’s business-first instincts.Yet even amid the choreography, there were hints of tension. Rupert Murdoch, Trump’s once-powerful ally turned legal adversary, was seated far from the president’s line of sight. Months earlier, Murdoch’s Wall Street Journal had broken the story about Trump’s ties to Jeffrey Epstein, leading to lawsuits and public feuds. Still, Murdoch was present—because Britain needed the symbolism of its most famous media mogul under the same roof as its most mercurial guest.This was Windsor diplomacy in miniature: even enemies were summoned, but placed carefully so as not to disrupt the main performance.Outside the castle, the spectacle looked different. Protesters projected Trump’s photos with Epstein onto Windsor’s ancient stone walls. Last week in Washington, diners heckled him as “Hitler” during his first public meal out since re-election. The banquet, then, was a temporary reprieve—a fortress designed to shield Trump from the political storms raging beyond the moat.But no banquet lasts forever. Once Trump leaves the Great Hall’s chandeliers and tapestries, he must return to a world less deferential. Britain, however, bet that the glow of Windsor would linger long enough to influence Thursday’s talks at Downing Street.This isn’t new. Britain has long used its monarchy to oil the gears of diplomacy. From Churchill to Thatcher, British leaders have leveraged royal pageantry to charm, flatter, and occasionally disarm foreign leaders. For Trump, whose worldview is explicitly transactional, the spectacle is a tool of persuasion: Britain offers him honour in exchange for concessions.For Starmer, facing an uphill climb to reset Britain’s global standing post-Brexit, Trump’s goodwill is critical. Tariffs, NATO commitments, and US-UK trade are all on the table. The White House may demand tribute, but Windsor shows Britain still knows how to stage-manage power.The Windsor banquet was more than pomp. It was Britain signalling that, despite diminished economic clout, it retains the ability to convene and charm. The monarchy, carefully modernised but still cloaked in medieval grandeur, remains its most potent weapon of influence.Trump got what he wanted: adulation, status, and the appearance of global centrality. Britain got what it wanted: a chance to soften him up before hard negotiations. Both sides left the castle with something—but whether royal flattery can survive Trump’s tariff hammer is the test that lies ahead.",Donald Trump dined with King Charles III and Queen Camilla at Windsor Castle.

LONDON: US President Donald Trump and his wife Melania received the largest ceremonial welcome ever seen for a state visit in living memory on Wednesday at Windsor Castle on their historic second state visit to Britain.Trump is the first US president ever to have a second state visit. Traditionally US presidents just have tea or lunch with the monarch on any subsequent visits to the UK.On Thursday Trump will travel to Chequers where he will meet UK PM Keir Starmer and unlock £31 billion worth of investments from America’s top technology firms, including Microsoft and Google, to boost the UK’s AI infrastructure.The couple spent Tuesday night at the US ambassador’s residence in Regent’s Park where Trump, perhaps suffering from jet lag, posted a flurry of posts on Truth Social until 3.23am UK time, including an article titled “US President Trump dials PM Modi, greets him on birthday”.On Wednesday they flew by Marine One to Windsor Castle and were taken in a horse-drawn procession, together with the King and Queen and William and Kate, through the estate. They watched military parades and Trump inspected the exceptionally large guard of honour.Lt Col Storm Green, captain of the guard of honour, said: “It is the first time we have got all three state colours out — the Grenadier Guards, Coldstream Guards and Scots Guards — for a foreign head of state.It’s the biggest one I have done in my 28-year career.”For Starmer, the visit serves as a welcome distraction to the problems he is facing domestically.After lunch, they viewed the Royal Collection where Trump took a particular interest in a document indicating when George III realised America was no longer under his control.They laid a wreath on the tomb of the late Queen Elizabeth II at St George’s Chapel. After that there was due to be a flypast by the Red Arrows alongside British and American F-35 jets, followed by a glittering white-tie banquet.The entire day took place within the walls of Windsor Castle. Meanwhile “Stop Trump” demonstrators gathered in London and the Guardian ran an article by London mayor Sadiq Khan slamming Trump.Four men were arrested on Tuesday night after projecting a giant image of Trump and the late child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein onto the exterior walls of Windsor Castle. Police swiftly stopped the projection. The men remain in police custody. Trump has never been officially accused of wrongdoing in connection with Epstein, with whom he was friends earlier in life. On Wednesday, a van could be seen in Windsor displaying a large image on one side of Trump and Epstein with the message: ""Welcome to the UK, Donald. ""A Thames Valley Police spokesperson told TOI: “The driver was at risk of breaching the Road Traffic Regulations Act, and after a brief conversation with officers the motorist left the area. No arrests were made.”",US President Donald Trump and his wife Melania received the largest ceremonial welcome ever seen for a state visit in living memory.

Who was Marissa Laimou?







A 28-year-old Greek heiress, Marissa Laimou, a cancer survivor, was found dead in her London flat on September 11. Her family revealed that she was displaying symptoms like dizziness, fever, infections and visited a hospital that turned her away and claimed that she was bitten by an insect.A doctor visited her home and prescribed paracetamol initially, but as her situation did not improve, she was sent to see an oncologist at a hospital. From there she was rushed to another unit but her family claimed that - after being seen by nurses instead of a doctor at the second hospital - she was sent home. Laimou was discharged and handed antibiotics and a diagnosis that referred to an insect bite. But the next day, she was dead.“She was bitten by an insect, she was itchy, she went to the doctor, she took antibiotics, she ate, she slept and she never woke up. My daughter was saved from cancer. My little child,” her mother said, as quoted by the Independent. “She was a girl with so many gifts. All of England is crying, all her doctors too,” she added.The hospital from which Laimou was sent home has reportedly opened an internal investigation over the incident.Meanwhile, a post-mortem is due to be carried out in the coming days.“The entire family is shocked by the sudden death of the daughter of Diamantis and Bessie Laimou. She was a very kind girl, quiet, educated, cultured, modest and simple. She loved art and theatre, she was involved in theatre. Warm condolences to the family! Strength and courage!"" Marissa's great-aunt Chrysanthi said.Daughter of Diamantis and Bessue Laimou, Marissa was part of a wealthy Greek shipping family. She recently survived breast cancer and was working in fashion, business and theatre. She worked in Paris with fashion designers including Sonia Rykiel and John Galliano. Later, she founded Rainbow Wave, a company through which she introduced international brands to UK/London retailers. She was involved in theatre production in London; one recent production was Romeo and Juliet, and she was preparing more theatrical work before her death.","Marissa Laimou, 28, was found dead in her London flat on September 11.

Protesters wave Union Jack and St George's England flags during the ""Unite The Kingdom"" rally on Westminster Bridge by the Houses of Parliament on September 13.





Hindus in the UK were placed in the spotlight at a massive rally in London on September 13, where far-right activist Tommy Robinson, known for his harsh criticism of Muslims, described Indians, particularly Hindus, as a ""peaceful, peace-loving migrant community"".The remarks come weeks before Diwali, when Leicester’s celebrations, once the largest outside India, are being significantly scaled back. Labour-run Leicester City Council has cancelled all public festivities apart from lighting up Diwali lanterns on lampposts and closing Belgrave Road on October 20. A safety advisory group cited public safety concerns after last year’s celebrations attracted a record 55,000 people.The contrast is striking. While Leicester’s Hindu community sees its biggest cultural showcase trimmed down to LED lights and a Ferris wheel, Robinson has positioned himself as a vocal defender of Hindus, especially in the wake of the 2022 Leicester unrest and the grooming gang scandals that have strained community relations.Following the Leicester clashes, Robinson vowed to protect British Hindus, even offering to mobilise “hundreds of men” to support them, as he told a right-wing Indian news outlet.His narrative has since amplified themes of Hindu victimhood, including claims of “a genocide on Hindus” in Bangladesh after the fall of Sheikh Hasina’s government, though videos he circulated at the time were later proven fake.In May, a police intelligence report cited by the Daily Mail noted growing links between far-right groups and Hindu extremists in Britain, rooted in a “shared hatred of Muslims”.

Poll Do you think the judicial system is effective in addressing cases of workplace abuse? Yes, it works well No, it fails many victims





An Indian-origin heart surgeon, Amal Bose, 55, has been sentenced to six years in jail in the UK for abusing his position to sexually assault female colleagues at Blackpool Hospital in Lancaster. But Bose told the police when they arrested him that ""it was only flirting"".The incidents took place between 2017 and 2022. when he had headed the hospital's cardiovascular surgery department. One woman told the court that Bose's behavior was a well-known fact and newcomers used to be advised on how to deal with him.Bose regularly commented on women's appearances and called them 'fresh meat' on a WhatsApp group.One of Bose's victims told the court she was groped by the surgeon as she scrubbed up ahead of surgery. On another occasion, shortly after she joined the department, Bose rested his head on her shoulder. Another victim was groped in an operating theatre as she helped the consultant prepare for an operation. After putting his gloves on, Bose 'purposefully' grabbed her breast, the court heard.One woman said Bose groped her breast as he helped himself to a pen from her top pocket.One said she was touched inappropriately every time she saw him and that used to leave her frightened and anxious, forcing her to change her working time to avoid him.Defending Bose, Tom Price KC said he realised that Bose had put his victims through the ordeal of a trial but that his client had only fully realised their true hurt in court. The court was informed that Bose was a highly skilled surgeon but lost his job in the wake of the complaints and was now working as a parcel deliveryman.Judge Unsworth acknowledged that Bose was a highly skilled surgeon who had been held in high regard by his colleagues. But he said this simply served to make his offending ""all the more tragic"".","Amal Bose, 55, has been sentenced to six years in jail in the UK for abusing his position to sexually assault female colleagues at Blackpool Hospital.

Rome's airport opens luxurious dog hotel with pampering services,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/romes-airport-opens-luxurious-dog-hotel-with-pampering-services/articleshow/124033139.cms,"A dog named Zoe, runs out from one of the rooms of the Dog Relais, a hotel for dogs at Rome's Fiumicino International Airport (AP photo)





FIUMICINO: Dog owners often face a dilemma before traveling: leave your beloved pet with a sitter or at a kennel? Both require quite some planning and logistics, which can be stressful and time-consuming for fur parents.Rome's Fiumicino International Airport has sought to streamline the process by opening one of the first on-site hotels at a major European airport, following a similar initiative in Frankfurt. Dog Relais' workers even retrieve pups from the terminal so travelers can proceed straight to their flight.""This project is fitting into a strategy to provide a very immersive experience to passengers,"" said Marilena Blasi, chief commercial officer at Aeroporti di Roma, the company that manages Italian capital's two airports. ""In this case, we provide services to dogs and the owners of the dogs.""Basic rooms at the dog hotel cost about €40 ($47) and feature temperature-controlled floors and private gardens. More timid or solitary dogs can be placed in kennels at the edge of the facility, where they interact with staff rather than other dogs in the common grass pens. At night, ambient music that has a frequency with a low, soft tone - 432 hertz - designed for relaxation is piped in through the rooms' speakers.There are optional extras that range from the usual grooming, bathing and cleaning teeth services, to the more indulgent, such as aromatherapy with lavender or peppermint scents to help induce calm, or arnica cream rubbed into aching muscles and joints.Owners unsatisfied with standard-issue webcams for checking in on their canines from afar can spring for a €60 (about $70) premium room equipped with a screen for round-the-clock videocalls. They can even pamper their pet by tossing a treat via an application connected to a dispenser.The facility not only provides its services to travelers, but also to dog owners who need daycare.Working in human resources for Aeroporti di Roma, Alessandra Morelli regularly leaves her 2-year-old, chocolate-colored Labrador Retriever there.""Since I've been able to bring Nina to this dog hotel, my life, and the balance between my personal and professional life have changed because it allows me to enjoy my working day and my personal travels in total peace and tranquility,"" said Morelli, 47.Dario Chiassarini, 32, said he started bringing his Rottweiler puppy, Athena, to Dog Relais for training, another service on offer, because it's clean, well-organized and its location was easily accessible. And he said he plans to check his beloved pup into the hotel whenever he and his girlfriend need to travel.""We will rely on them without hesitation and without doubt - both because we got to know the people who work here, which for us is essential, and because of the love they have for animals and the peace of mind of knowing who we are entrusting Athena to,"" said Chiassarini, who works in car sales. ""It is certainly a service that, if we should need it, we will make use of.""The dog hotel has proved popular so far. All 40 rooms were occupied in August, when Italians take their customary summer vacation and millions of passengers come through Fiumicino. Occupancy averaged almost 2/3 since doors opened in May, said Blasi.The same month the dog hotel opened, Italy's commercial aviation authority changed rules to allow large dogs to fly inside plane cabins for domestic flights, provided they are inside secured crates. The first such flight will take off on Sept. 23, according to transport minister, Matteo Salvini.Salvini admits that while many are happy with having their pups on the plane, others may feel annoyed. However, at a pet conference on Sept. 16, he said: ""We always have to use judgment, but ... for me it's a source of pride, as well as a step forward from the point of view of civilization.""","Rome's Fiumicino International Airport has sought to streamline the process by opening one of the first on-site hotels at a major European airport.

Political parties targeted



Election backdrop







A mass anti-immigration demonstration in The Hague erupted into violence on Saturday, with protesters clashing with police, torching a patrol car and vandalising a political party’s headquarters. Authorities confirmed that 30 people were arrested and two officers injured as the unrest escalated across the Dutch city just weeks before a snap election.Around 1,500 demonstrators gathered in the Malieveld district demanding tougher asylum policies, many of them waving Dutch and far-right flags. What began as a rally quickly descended into chaos when groups hurled bottles and stones at officers, blocked a highway and set fire to a police vehicle, according to ANP news agency. Riot police deployed tear gas and water cannon in a bid to regain control.The violence spilled into the city centre, where protesters smashed the windows of the headquarters of the centre-left D66 party, a frequent target of far-right anger. “Scum. You keep your hands off political parties,” D66 leader Rob Jetten wrote on X. “If you think you can intimidate us, tough luck. We will never let extremist rioters take our beautiful country away.”Nobody was inside the offices at the time, though the party later reported extensive damage. Justice Minister Foort van Oosten condemned the assaults on police as “absolutely unacceptable,” writing: “Demonstrating is a great thing in the Netherlands, but hands off our officers!”Caretaker Prime Minister Dick Schoof described the scenes as “shocking and bizarre images of shameless violence,” and vowed that prosecutors would ensure rioters face justice.The protests were organised by right-wing activists amid growing anger over migration, an issue that has already toppled the Dutch government. The coalition collapsed in June after far-right leader Geert Wilders pulled his PVV party out in a dispute over asylum policy.Wilders, who remains ahead in polls ahead of the 29 October election, had been invited to speak at Saturday’s rally but did not attend. Instead, he condemned the violence as the work of “idiots” and “scum,” adding that blocking highways and attacking police was “utterly unacceptable.”Former European Commissioner Frans Timmermans, now leader of the Labour-Green alliance, compared the scenes to “Trumpian conditions, fuelled by politicians who sow fear and division,” urging citizens not to remain silent.","30 people arrested and two officers injured in anti-immigration protests in The Hague.

Air India issues advisory







A cyberattack on a third-party service provider has disrupted check-in and boarding systems at several European airports. London’s Heathrow, Brussels, and Berlin airports are suffering widespread flight delays and cancellations, airport authorities confirmed on Saturday. Air India also issued a travel advisory for passengers flying out of London’s Heathrow.According to Brussels airport, the cyberattack rendered automated check-in and boarding systems inoperable, forcing airlines to switch to manual processing, which significantly impacted operations.“This has a large impact on the flight schedule and will unfortunately cause delays and cancellations of flights,” the airport said in a statement on its website. “The service provider is actively working on the issue and trying to resolve the problem as quickly as possible,” it added.By 10:30am on Saturday, 10 departing flights from Brussels Airport had been cancelled and 17 others were delayed by over an hour, according to airport spokesperson Ariane Goossens, reported Politico.London’s Heathrow airport also issued a statement, attributing the disruption to a “technical issue” at a third-party supplier, Collins Aerospace.The provider of check-in and boarding systems for multiple airlines worldwide, is facing a technical issue that could lead to delays for departing passengers.A spokesperson for Collins Aerospace said the company had become aware of a ""cyber-related disruption"" affecting their MUSE software at certain airports, and added that they are ""actively working to resolve the issue and restore full functionality to our customers as quickly as possible.""""The impact is limited to electronic customer check-in and baggage drop and can be mitigated with manual check-in operations,"" they added.Passengers were advised by the affected airports to check with their airlines before heading to the airport.Berlin Airport published a notice on its homepage warning travellers of longer waiting times at check-in, citing a technical issue at a system provider operating across Europe.

‘NATO Weapons Crushed’: Russian Bombing Bleeds Ukraine Amid Truce Talks Delay





Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Saturday said that Russia launched one of the most intense attacks in recent weeks, firing 40 missiles and approximately 580 drones overnight across Ukraine, killing at least three people and injuring dozens, reported news agency AFP.In a statement on social media, Zelensky said the massive overnight bombardment included both cruise and ballistic missiles, along with a wide range of drones.“All night, Ukraine was under a massive attack by Russia,” he said. “As of now, we know of dozens of people injured from the shelling, and, unfortunately, three people killed,” Zewlenskyy said, as quoted by the agency.Among the hardest-hit areas was Dnipro, where a missile carrying cluster munitions struck a residential building, according to the Ukrainian president. In the Dnipro region, local governor Sergiy Lysak confirmed one death and 26 people injured, including at least one in critical condition.In northern Ukraine, a 62-year-old man was killed in a drone attack in Chernigiv, local official Vyacheslav Chaus said. In Khmelnytskyi region, around 20 residential buildings were damaged, and one body was recovered during firefighting operations, regional administrator Sergiy Tyurin said.Nationwide air raid alerts were issued, including in the Kyiv region, as Ukrainian air defences responded to incoming missiles and drones.Meanwhile, Russia's defence ministry claimed its forces repelled multiple Ukrainian drone attacks in the southern Volgograd, Rostov, and Saratov regions. One civilian was reportedly wounded in Saratov. Russian forces said they intercepted and destroyed 149 Ukrainian drones overnight.Fighting continues to intensify in eastern Ukraine, where Russian troops are pushing to seize more territory in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.Efforts to broker a ceasefire have stalled, with growing frustration in Kyiv. Ukraine accuses Moscow of using continued shelling to derail peace talks. Talks had appeared to gain momentum last month after separate meetings between Russian President Vladimir Putin and US and Ukrainian leaders, including Donald Trump and Zelensky, but have since stalled.Separately, regional tensions have been rising. On Friday, Estonia accused Russia of violating its airspace with three military aircraft. Moscow denied the allegation, but it has raised alarm across NATO. Last week, Poland said around 20 Russian drones entered its airspace, a claim also denied by the Kremlin.In response, the UK, Germany, and France have announced plans to reinforce NATO’s eastern flank with additional aircraft for joint air patrols.","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia launched one of the most intense attacks in recent weeks.

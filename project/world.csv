Russia will 'not back down' to solve conflict's 'root causes'



'We haven't fully stopped supply': Trump







US President Donald Trump on Thursday said that he hadn't made any progress regarding a potential ceasefire in the Russia-Ukraine conflict following his telephone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday.When questioned about his discussion with Putin, Trump confirmed to journalists, ""No, I didn't make any progress with him today at all.""Trump elaborated on the conversation, stating, ""We had a call. It was a pretty long call. We talked about a lot of things, including Iran, and we also talked about, as you know, the war with Ukraine. And I'm not happy about that, I'm not happy.""""We had a call. It was a pretty long call. We talked about a lot of things, including Iran. We also talked about the war with Ukraine. I am not happy about that... No, I didn't make any progress with him (Russian President Putin) today..."" he said in brief comments at an air base outside Washington, before departing for a campaign-style event in Iowa.According to Putin's aide Yury Ushakov's summary, the leaders engaged in a ""frank and substantive"" discussion. Whilst Trump suggested an immediate ceasefire in Russia's Ukrainian campaign, Putin declined.Ushakov noted that Putin affirmed Russia's commitment to its objectives in the conflict, whilst remaining open to resolving the situation through diplomatic channels.""Our president said that Russia will pursue its goals, specifically addressing the root causes that led to the current situation, and will not back down from these objectives,"" Ushakov said.During an extensive, 60-minute conversation centred on the Ukrainian conflict and Middle Eastern developments, Trump reiterated his position on seeking an early conclusion to the military operations in Ukraine. This marked the sixth communication between Putin and Trump this year.""Trump once again emphasized the need to end military hostilities as soon as possible. Vladimir Putin noted that Russia continues to seek a politically negotiated solution to the conflict,"" Ushakov added.The Kremlin indicated that Putin updated Trump regarding the progress of agreements between Russia and Ukraine from the previous month, concerning prisoner of war exchanges and deceased military personnel. Putin expressed Russia's openness to re-engage in discussions with Kyiv.Ushakov stated that their president reaffirmed Russia's determination to accomplish its established objectives, particularly addressing the underlying causes of the present confrontation, maintaining an unwavering position on these aims.This communication occurred while Russia intensified its unmanned aerial vehicle and missile attacks across Ukraine in recent weeks and the US has paused shipments of certain critical weapons to Ukraine due to low stockpiles.Trump addressed reporters while departing for Iowa, stating ""we haven't"" fully stopped the weapons supply, while criticising Joe Biden for allegedly depleting American defence resources through excessive weapons transfers.""We're giving weapons, but we've given so many weapons. But we are giving weapons. And we're working with them and trying to help them, but we haven't. You know, Biden emptied out our whole country giving them weapons, and we have to make sure that we have enough for ourselves,"" he remarked.This exchange of diplomatic statements emerges amidst reports that the US has temporarily halted deliveries of specific crucial weapons to Ukraine, as sources informed Reuters. This pause occurs at a critical moment when Ukraine confronts a Russian summer offensive and faces growing attacks on civilian areas.","US President Donald Trump spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday.

Russia has become the first nation to officially acknowledge the Taliban's leadership in Afghanistan since their 2021 takeover, following Moscow's decision to remove the group from its banned organisations list on Thursday.The Russian foreign ministry confirmed receiving credentials from Afghanistan's new Ambassador Gul Hassan Hassan.The foreign ministry stated that recognising the Afghan government would enhance ""productive bilateral cooperation, AP reported.The Afghan foreign ministry called it a historic step, with Taliban foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi stating it sets ""a good example for other countries.""The Taliban assumed control of Afghanistan in August 2021 after US and NATO forces withdrew. They have since sought global recognition whilst implementing their strict interpretation of Islamic law.Prior to Russia's recognition, no nation had formally acknowledged the Taliban administration, though the group maintained high-level discussions and diplomatic relations with several countries, including China and the United Arab Emirates.The Taliban government has remained largely isolated internationally, primarily due to its restrictions on women.Despite initial promises of more moderate governance compared to their 1996-2001 rule, the Taliban began imposing limitations on women and girls shortly after taking power in 2021.Women face restrictions from most employment and public spaces, including parks, baths and gyms, whilst girls cannot pursue education beyond sixth grade.Russian officials have recently highlighted the importance of Taliban engagement for Afghanistan's stability, and removed their ban on the group in April.Russian ambassador to Afghanistan, Dmitry Zhirnov, announced on state Channel One television that President Vladimir Putin authorised the official recognition based on foreign minister Sergey Lavrov's recommendation.Zhirnov indicated that this decision demonstrates Russia's ""sincere striving for the development of full-fledged relations with Afghanistan.""",Russia has become the first nation to officially acknowledge the Taliban's leadership in Afghanistan since their 2021 takeover.

Generational Damage

Easy Targets, Innocent Recruits

Burden Of War

Liberating Women





In some places, they’re called the Children of Agent Orange. Not in Vietnam, Laos or Cambodia, but in the US. It wasn’t only American troops who returned who fell sick. Their children had odd birth defects — missing or extra limbs. For decades, any link was denied. Then more was revealed. Neurological conditions, gastrointestinal issues, spina bifida. Ravages of war didn’t spare soldiers’ families.As epigenetics grows, scepticism over a link between Agent Orange and generational disability is reducing. There’s some recognition that what a young soldier had to do in the faraway fields of Laos 50 years ago could today be harming his grandchild. A 2016 ProPublica investigation reported, “The odds of having a child born with birth defects during or after the war were more than a third higher for veterans who say they handled, sprayed or were directly sprayed with Agent Orange than for veterans who say they weren’t exposed or weren’t sure. ” Has anything come of it? Not yet.The world’s most powerful country, inured to its own gun violence culture, ignores the impact on American children at home when Washington wages war in the eastern hemisphere.Such denial to what war visits on children is evident in every conflict. Palestinian children in food queues bombed, Ukrainian kids held by Russia on the pretext of “rescue”, guns pushed into the hands of 10-year-olds dehumanised as tools of battle are atrocities sheltered under the umbrella of Collateral Damage.Unicef estimates that 50,000 children in Gaza have been killed or injured since Oct 2023. Kyiv estimates 20,000 Ukrainian children were taken away by Russia. There is no accountability anywhere. There is no paucity of data either on child recruitment in Sudan’s Darfur — an estimated 8,000 to 10,000 children have been recruited by govt paramilitary group RSF since 2023.When children are a blind spot, it should be no surprise that the well-documented impact on women is just as ignored. Every day, 500 women and girls in war-torn countries die from complications of pregnancy and childbirth. Bombed hospitals mean no access to maternal care for pregnant women.It’s women who must fend for children and elders in bombed quarters with resources and supplies running low. Also tucked under Collateral Damage. Rape as a weapon of war was once seen as a ‘wrong’ but, fact is, it is normalised. As wars find ways to extend in time and expand by area, there’s nothing to stop soldiers from targeting women, even little girls.Regressive regimes like the Taliban, and most orthodox rulers, show their writ through subjugation of women. Far too many wars are underpinned by a western ambition to ‘liberate’ women — the status of women in a country is invariably a factor that drives ‘regime change’ activity.Take Afghanistan alone. British, Russian, American wars found cheerleaders who backed their battles for a “brighter future for women’s rights”. But as Al Jazeera noted, “If Western wars ‘liberate’ Eastern women, Muslim women would be the most ‘liberated’ in the world. They are not, and will not be, especially when liberty is associated with Western hegemony.” Today, the world has neatly abandoned Afghanistan’s women. They still bear the burden of war.","Unicef estimates that 50,000 children in Gaza have been killed or injured since Oct 2023. 500 women and girls in war-torn countries die from complications of pregnancy and childbirth.

Ukraine: A Deeply Cultural War

The Othering

Some Hope?





Art and culture are both among the first casualties of war. Conflict not only makes people more parochial, it also breeds myths and misconceptions. It damages the soul and impedes evolution of the human spirit and mind. Artists and their works are victims of this destructive process. But so too are ordinary people, cities, places and shared cultural history.Many believe that the ongoing war in Ukraine is not just about territory but also about culture. That Russia is trying to erase Ukraine’s identity. There’s some evidence to show that Moscow has been targeting Ukrainian cultural elements. More than 1,000 Ukrainian heritage sites have been damaged and destroyed during the war. But this destruction is also a self-inflicted wound for Russian society itself.Before the war began in 2014 — the fullscale war commenced in 2022 — there was much intermingling between Ukrainian and Russian cultures. Russian language was spoken by many Ukrainian families due to the legacy of the Soviet Union, and joint cultural collaborations and projects were routine.In fact, Zelensky, who was formerly an actor and comedian, used to regularly perform in Russia, in Russian.In his early years as a comedian, he would take part in the biggest comedy competition in the Russian-speaking world called the KVN championships. It was the most influential cultural product coming out of Russia, connecting all the former Soviet republics. But war has severed all those connections today. And Zelensky, like many of his countrymen, no longer speaks Russian.War weaponises differences while deliberately ignoring shared experiences and enriched intermingling. Moses Maimonides was a 12th century Jewish philosopher, considered one of the greatest Jewish intellectuals of all time. He even rose to be the court physician of Sultan Saladin. His seminal work, Mishneh Torah, a 14-volume text on Jewish law, would not have been possible without Arab-Muslim interpretations of Aristotle and Plato. For logic, he relied on Arab scholar Al-Farabi.Yet, today this shared history between Jews and Muslims is largely forgotten in the din of conflict. Narratives have gained ground that sees Jews and Arab-Muslims as separate people, without any shared constructive history.Even sectarian conflicts within a religion can lead to extreme othering. During the civil war in Iraq in the last decade, a common myth among Sunnis, incredibly, was that Shias have ‘tails’. This othering completely ignores the fact that Shias and Sunnis have lived together for centuries, contributing to each other’s cultural and material life. The same is true for North and South Korea, where years of conflict and separation are witnessing the common Korean language diverge.But thanks to the internet, during recent conflicts, people from warring countries like Israel and Iran have been connecting via online platforms to engage outside govt communications. This raises hope that online connectivity can mitigate cultural schisms wrought by conflict. But with govts acquiring tools to ‘guide’ online discourse, this window can also be shut, locking societies into reductive silos.","Many believe that the ongoing war in Ukraine is not just about territory but also about culture.

I understand that we could talk more. But it's so awkward to make him (Trump) wait, he could get offended,"" Putin said as he signed off mid-event.The two leaders had a long conversation, as described by Trump, over phone on Thursday and they discussed Ukraine and Iran among other issues.""We had a call.

Donald Trump’s signature tax-and-spending package, 'Big Beautiful Bill', was thrown into limbo as Republican leaders in Congress scrambled to rein in party rebels threatening to derail the centerpiece of the president’s domestic agenda.Trump is seeking final House approval for the bill after its razor-thin passage in the Senate, but divisions within his own party have left the legislation teetering. Fiscal hawks bristle at ballooning deficits; moderates fear historic cuts to Medicaid and other safety net programs could cost them re-election.Trump vented his frustration on Truth Social saying, ""Largest Tax Cuts in History and a Booming Economy vs. Biggest Tax Increase in History, and a Failed Economy. What are the Republicans waiting for??? What are you trying to prove??? MAGA IS NOT HAPPY, AND IT’S COSTING YOU VOTES!!!""House Speaker Mike Johnson, caught between these factions, kept procedural votes open for hours, including one that set a record as the longest in House history, while his team huddled behind closed doors with holdouts. ""We're going to get there tonight. We're working on it and very, very positive about our progress,"" Politico quoted Johnson saying.Meanwhile, Trump turned up the pressure saying, ""FOR REPUBLICANS, THIS SHOULD BE AN EASY YES VOTE. RIDICULOUS!!!""Republican leaders had hoped to quickly push Trump’s massive tax-and-spending bill through the House on Wednesday, aiming for a smooth approval well ahead of the president’s self-imposed July 4 deadline.But their plans hit turbulence as the 887-page legislation, already tweaked in the Senate to appease hardliners, faced resistance from within.One conservative balked at the prospect of adding to the $37 trillion national debt, while two moderates worried about nearly $1 trillion in healthcare cuts that could leave 17 million Americans without insurance and shutter rural hospitals.The sprawling $4.5 trillion package delivers on several of Trump’s campaign promises, increased military spending, mass deportation funding, and extended tax cuts from his first term. But it also adds $3.4 trillion to the deficit over a decade and slashes nearly $1 trillion from health care programs, raising alarms about millions losing insurance and rural hospitals shuttering.With House Democrats unified in opposition and eyeing the bill as a potent campaign weapon for 2026, the pressure is squarely on Trump and Republican leaders to unite their fractured caucus and deliver the legislative victory the president demands.","Trump is seeking final House approval for the bill after its razor-thin passage in the Senate.

Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska made a critical call on Tuesday, casting a vote for President Donald Trump’s massive tax-and-spending bill.For much of the all‑night session, Senate Minority Whip John Thune was uncertain whether he could secure Murkowski’s support. The Alaska senator spent hours in public and private discussions, pressing colleagues to soften provisions she said would burden her state’s most vulnerable residents.Murkowski at the end provided the 50th Republican “yea”, paving the way for Vice‑President JD Vance to break the tie and pass the measure 51‑50.Three Republicans—Susan Collins of Maine, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Rand Paul of Kentucky—joined all Democrats in opposing the bill.“I advocated for my state’s interests, and I will make no excuses for doing that,” Murkowski told reporters just after the vote. “Do I like this bill? No. But I tried to take care of Alaska’s interests.”Her support was unsure after the Senate parliamentarian struck down two attempts to boost Medicaid payments for Alaska and Hawaii, ruling they violated reconciliation rules. A further bid to increase Alaska’s Medicaid funding was also rejected early Tuesday, dealing another blow to Thune’s efforts.“I held my head up and made sure that the people of Trump’s ‘Big Beautiful Bill’ could cost thousands of lives, say University researchersAlaska are not forgotten in this,” Murkowski said. “I think there is more that needs to be done, and I’m not done.

US President Donald Trump launched a scathing attack on New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani during his speech at the America250 rally held at the Iowa State Fairgrounds on Thursday evening.Speaking to a large crowd gathered to kick off a yearlong celebration of the United States’ 250th anniversary, Trump branded Mamdani a “communist at the highest level”.He accused Mamdani of wanting to “destroy New York.” “I love New York, and we’re not going to let him do that,” he said. Trump went on to call Mamdani’s campaign part of a broader ideological threat, stating, “Generations of Americans before us did not shed their blood only so that we could surrender our country to Marxist lunatics on the eve of our 250th year.”Trump proclaimed, “As president of the United States, I’m proclaiming here and now that America is never going to be communist in any way, shape, form, and that includes New York City.”In a recent press conference, Trump again called Mamdani New York City’s Democratic mayoral candidate a “communist” and a “nut job” vowing to block federal funds if Mamdani doesn’t “do the right thing.”“He’s a communist. The last thing we need is a communist,” Trump said, adding, “I think I’m going to have a lot of fun watching him because he has to come right through this building to get his money.”Mamdani, a 33-year-old democratic socialist and state Assembly member, had earlier denied the claims on NBC’s Meet the Press, saying, “No, I am not [a communist]… Trump wants to distract from what I’m fighting for, working people he pretended to represent.”Also read | Trump targets Zohran Mamdani, vows to cut NYC funds if Democratic frontrunner becomes mayor","US President Donald Trump launched a scathing attack on New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani during his speech at the America250 rally held at the Iowa State Fairgrounds on Thursday evening.

WASHINGTON: Hakeem Jeffries talked. And talked. And talked, as the top Democrat in the House of Representatives on Thursday blasted President Donald Trump's sweeping tax cut and spending bill in the longest speech in the chamber's history. Jeffries' speech, at 8 hours and 46 minutes, marked Democrats' last chance to prosecute their case against the $3.4 trillion package.Lacking the votes to defeat the measure in a chamber that Republicans control by a slim 220-212 margin, Jeffries, 54, railed against legislation that he characterised as a giveaway to the wealthy that would strip less affluent Americans of health nd food safety net benefits.""It's not the type of leadership that this country needs right now. But that's what we're getting Chaos. Cruelty. And corruption,"" he said. Jeffries began speaking at 4.53am ET and wrapped up at 1.38pm ET. That broke a 2021 House record sent by then-House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy, who spent 8 hours and 32 minutes lambasting Democratic President Biden's clean-energy and domestic-spending package.The House of Representatives launched a final yes-or-no vote after the speech.His speech also recalled that of another Democratic lawmaker, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, who broke the record for the longest Senate speech in April with a 25-hour, five-minute attack on Trump's unilateral firings of federal workers. Booker's performance drew cheers from Democratic voters who have been frustrated by their party's powerlessness in Washington and have accused the party's leaders of being too meek.Jeffries used his status as Democratic leader to stretch his customary 60-second speaking time, known as a ""magic minute"", for several hours.That likely will not be enough to block passage of Trump's bill, which has already passed the Republican-controlled Senate. But Jeffries made clear he had his eye on a prize further down the road.Voters, Jeffries said, ""will get even"" in the Nov 2026 congressional elections ""because of these cuts being unleashed on the American people.""If Democrats win control of the House, Jeffries would be positioned to make history again by becoming the first Black House speaker in the Congress that convenes at the start of 2027.Early into his speech, Jeffries showcased sick children in Republicans' home districts who might eventually lose Medicaid coverage under the legislation. It was a maneuver that could increase coverage of his speech in local media across the country. Jeffries pulled no punches.He said the bill was ""ripping healthcare"" from Americans and called it ""shameful,"" ""disgusting"" and ""reckless.""

WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump's tax-cut package cleared its final hurdle in the US Congress on Thursday, as the Republican-controlled House of Representatives narrowly approved the massive bill and sent it to him to sign into law.The 218-214 vote amounts to a significant victory for the Republican president that will fund his immigration crackdown, make his 2017 tax cuts permanent and deliver new tax breaks that he promised during his 2024 campaign. It also cuts health and food safety net programmes and zeroes out dozens of green energy incentives. It would add $3.4 trillion to the nation's $36.2 trillion debt, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.Despite concerns over the 869-page bill's price tag and its hit to healthcare programmes, Republicans largely lined up in support, with only two of the House's 220 Republicans voting against it. The bill has already cleared the Republican-controlled Senate by the narrowest possible margin. Republicans said the legislation will lower taxes for Americans across the income spectrum and spur economic growth.Republican Representative Virginia Foxx of North Carolina described the bill as bringing ""Historic tax relief for working families.Massive investment to secure our nation's borders. Capturing generational savings. Slashing waste, fraud and abuse in government programs so that they may run more efficiently.""Every Democrat in Congress voted against it, blasting the bill as a giveaway to the wealthy that would leave millions uninsured. ""The focus of this bill, the justification for all of the cuts that will hurt everyday Americans, is to provide massive tax breaks for billionaires,"" House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said in an eight-hour, 46-minute speech that was the longest in the chamber's history.Jeffries began speaking at 4.53am ET and wrapped up at 1.38pm ET.

""FOR REPUBLICANS, THIS SHOULD BE AN EASY YES VOTE. RIDICULOUS!!!"" he wrote on social media. Republicans raced to meet that deadline, working through last weekend and holding all-night debates in the House and the Senate.

This week, the Capitol felt like a massive library packed with students pulling all-nighters before exams and for exhausted Republican lawmakers, the pressure was just as intense, if not more, since President Donald Trump was keeping a close eye on their every move.The final stage of Trump’s sweeping tax and spending bill began Monday morning, with a marathon session of proposed amendments to the Senate version of the legislation. The process, known as a “vote-a-rama,” lasted for more than 24 hours.The process is typically a chance for the minority party to put the majority on the spot with tough political votes.This time, however, it allowed senate majority leader John Thune to work behind the scenes and address concerns from hesitant lawmakers. Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina ultimately voted no, shortly after revealing he wouldn't run for reelection.In the early morning hours, senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska wrapped herself in a cozy blanket, while senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts sported a zip-up hoodie on the typically formal senate floor.In contrast to Tillis, senator Lisa Murkowski, who had previously voiced concerns over the bill’s cuts to Medicaid and clean energy, ultimately switched to a “yes” vote on Tuesday morning.Her support helped move the bill forward, sending it back to the House for further debate and a final vote on the revisions.H ouse speaker Mike Johnson called lawmakers back to Washington right away, despite summer storms grounding flights. Some members resorted to renting vans and driving. Representative Nancy Mace shared her road trip on social media, making stops at Waffle House and Wawa while wearing pajamas.Moderate Republicans and hardline fiscal conservatives openly criticized the bill, pledging to vote “no” unless it was revised to meet their demands. Meanwhile, Trump slammed the dissenters onTruth Social, repeating his insistence that the House deliver the bill to him by July 4.Trump got his wish completed with a narrow vote on Thursday, but not before Democratic house minority leader Hakeem Jeffries delivered a record-breaking, eight-hour-long speech on the house floor, condemning the bill as a “full-scale attack” on health care and social safety-net programs.","The final stage of Trump’s sweeping tax and spending bill began Monday morning, with a marathon session of proposed amendments to the Senate version of the legislation.

"Won’t attack US: Iran says no plans to escalate, but will continue Uranium enrichment; open for talks",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/wont-attack-us-iran-says-no-plans-to-escalate-but-will-continue-uranium-enrichment-open-for-talks/articleshow/122235818.cms,"Donald Trump (left), Ayotollah Khamenie (AP)





Iran has no plans to further retaliate in response to the US strikes on its nuclear program last month, a senior government official told NBC News on Thursday, adding that the country is open to talks with Washington.However, deputy foreign minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi said Iran has no intention of stopping its uranium enrichment, confirming that the country will continue developing its nuclear program despite the recent attack.“We have already responded to that, as long as there is no act of aggression being perpetrated by the United States against us, we will not respond again,” Takht-Ravanchi said when asked if more was to come.After the US bombing, Iran fired missiles at the American Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar. However, Qatari defenses stopped the attack, as Iran had given a warning ahead of time. This warning seemed to show that Iran was trying to ease tensions following a nearly two-week conflict with Israel that led to direct involvement from the US.President Donald Trump posting on Truth Social, responded in a similarly conciliatory after the Iranian strike,to thank Iran for the advance warning and saying that “they’ve gotten it all out of their ‘system.’”Takht-Ravanchi voiced dismay over the missile exchanges while Iran was in talks with Trump about its nuclear program. Iran had been limiting its uranium enrichment under the 2015 nuclear agreement with the US, called the joint comprehensive plan of action, but that deal essentially collapsed in 2018 when Trump pulled the US out.“How can we trust the Americans? We want them to explain as to why they misled us, why they took such an egregious action against our people,” the deputy minister added.But he went on to add that his country would be open to talks.“We are for diplomacy and we are for dialogue,” Takht-Ravanchi said, adding ""but the US government needs to convince us that they are not going to use military force while we are negotiating. That is an essential element for our leadership to be in a position to decide about the future round of talks.”Iran has kept quiet about the real effects of the strikes, raising concerns that the attacks may have pushed its nuclear program deeper into secrecy.“The damage is serious,” Takht-Ravanchi said about the American attack, without elaborating further.Iran insists it is not seeking to build a nuclear bomb. As a member of the 1970 nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT), it has the right to enrich uranium for use in nuclear energy.“Our policy has not changed on enrichment,” Takht-Ravanchi reiterated to NBC. “Iran has every right to do enrichment within its territory. The only thing that we have to observe is not to go for militarization.”He also said that Iran is “ready to engage with others to talk about the scope, the level, the capacity of our enrichment program.”","Deputy foreign minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi said Iran has no intention of stopping its uranium enrichment.

Former German chancellor Angela Merkel called US President Donald Trump an attention-seeker, while speaking at an event organised by Greek newspaper Kathimerini in Athens on Wednesday.Merkel was attending an event to promote the Greek edition of her memoir “Freedom” when she recalled an incident from March 2017. At a meeting with Donald Trump in the Oval Office, he refused to shake hands with her, an incident that took place off-camera, outside the main room.""I made the mistake of saying, 'Donald, we should shake hands,' and he didn't. He wanted to draw attention to himself. That’s what he wants: to distract and have everyone look at him,” Merkel said.""You can see this in what he is doing with the tariffs. Ultimately, he must deliver good results for the American people. He has to prove his abilities, at least to his own country,” she added.She went on to urge the European Union to stand up to Trump’s tariff threats and not be intimidated.“Europeans must stand united and not be intimidated when Trump imposes more tariffs on the bloc, but we should retaliate with tariffs of our own.”""I'm not saying we should break off relations with the US, but we must negotiate. Even the US cannot survive alone,” Merkel said, adding: “I see a problematic development.When Vice President Vance says, 'we are partners, and we will only support you if you agree with our concept of freedom,' which means no rules and no controls, that is indeed a threat to our democracy.""Merkel was at the helm of European affairs as the de-facto leader of the EU during Trump’s first Presidency, but the pair never had an easy rapport.

Each property could only be allocated once. If he didn’t get it, someone else did.

"Pakistan assumes Security Council presidency: UN credibility at risk, says Baloch leader Hyrbyair Marri",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-assumes-security-council-presidency-un-credibility-at-risk-says-baloch-leader-hyrbyair-marri/articleshow/122227266.cms,"



Baloch pro-independence leader Hyrbyair Marri has sharply criticised Pakistan’s assumption of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) presidency for the month of July, calling it ""a profound affront to global human rights"" and a dangerous move that threatens global stability.In a post on X, Marri accused the UN of legitimising a state he described as built on oppression and deception. “When the accused are handed the gavel, international credibility erodes,” Marri said, warning that privilege has replaced accountability in global diplomacy.Referring to a recent statement by Pakistan’s permanent representative to the UN on promoting peace and diplomacy, Marri called it ironic. “The very country preaching peace today has exported terrorism and jihad while practising religious persecution at home,” he stated.Marri cited Pakistan’s alleged historical record of human rights abuses, including its involvement in the killing of Afghans during decades of conflict, the 1971 genocide of Bengalis, and its role in the suppression of Palestinians during General Zia-ul-Haq’s tenure. “Then-Brigadier Zia allegedly murdered thousands of Palestinians in Jordan,” Marri said.He accused Pakistan of continuing its violent campaign against the Baloch people since annexing Balochistan in 1948, in what he described as a violation of Article 2 of the UN Charter.“Pakistan has forcefully killed and disappeared hundreds of thousands of Baloch,” he said.Marri recalled key betrayals in Baloch history, including the imprisonment of Prince Abdul Kareem, the younger brother of the Khan of Kalat, who was jailed for 17 years after seeking negotiations, and the hanging of the sons of Nawab Nauroz Khan despite Pakistan's sworn assurance of safe talks. “Pakistan swore on the Quran to honour the talks, then publicly desecrated it twice,” Marri said.He further warned that Pakistan remains an artificial and militarised state, dominated by a Punjabi elite that suppresses minority national identities through enforced disappearances, torture, religious conversions, and extrajudicial killings.Marri concluded by urging the international community to reconsider its engagement with Pakistan. “Your decision lends moral sanction to a regime steeped in terror and oppression. Accountability must never yield to privilege,” he said, calling on democratic nations to revoke Pakistan’s UNSC presidency and recognise it as a rogue state.","Baloch pro-independence leader Hyrbyair Marri has sharply criticised Pakistan’s assumption of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) presidency for the month of July.

NEW DELHI: A massive outcry has erupted in Pakistan's restive Balochistan province following the disappearance and subsequent killing of a young Baloch activist, Zeeshan Ahmed , by military personnel.Zeeshan had been campaigning for the safe return of his father, Zaheer, who was also forcibly disappeared by Pakistan's Frontier Corps in 2015. Zeeshan was 11 years old at that time, and his sister a 40-day-old newborn.Zeeshan went missing on June 29 and his body was recovered the next day.The incident is the latest in a series of ""forced disappearances"" that has long plagued Balochistan. According to a Human Rights Watch report, there are 8,463 documented cases of such disappearances between 2011 and 2024; the Pakistan Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances estimates at least 10,078 cases.Zeeshan was abducted on June 29, around 8pm, after a football match. He was walking towards home when ""two vehicles belonging to the state-backed death squad intercepted him"", the Baloch Yakjehti Committee said. ""Witnesses saw him beaten up, his hands bound and then thrown into one of the vehicles,"" the committee said.That same night, family and residents of Panjgur blocked the CPEC road and began a sit-in, demanding Zeeshan's immediate release. By morning, they were mourning as Zeeshan's ""bullet-riddled body was found dumped in Panjgur.

At least 64 people have died and 117 others have been injured across Pakistan in the past week due to flash floods and heavy rain, a government agency said on Wednesday.The worst-hit area was the northwestern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where 23 people, including 10 children, lost their lives. In Punjab province, another 21 people were killed—11 of them children—mainly due to homes collapsing in the rain, reported news agency AFP.Over the weekend, torrential rain triggered sudden floods in the Swat Valley. In one incident, 12 members of a family from Mardan were swept away while picnicking near the river. Locals said there were no immediate rescue efforts despite repeated calls for help. Videos from the scene showed people clinging to rocks and screaming as waters surged.“We kept dialling the emergency numbers, but no one came. By the time they did, it was too late,” Kabeer, a local vendor who helped retrieve bodies, told TOI earlier.Swat residents expressed frustration at repeated government failures in disaster response. “This valley has lived through terrorists, military operations, and devastating floods. Every time, we’re promised lessons will be learned, but nothing changes,” said Khan Sher from Mingora.Despite its push for climate justice globally, Pakistan's domestic preparedness remains weak. Locals in tourist towns like Bahrain and Kalam, where riverside hotels were hit hard, said the floods turned busy market areas into danger zones within minutes.“Each year we mourn our dead, patch up the roads, and brace for the next disaster,” said Liaquat Bacha, a farmer whose fields were destroyed.

Five people, including a senior local administrator, were killed when a roadside bomb struck a government vehicle in northwestern Pakistan on Wednesday, injuring 11 others, according to local police, cited by news agency AP.The attack occurred in Bajaur, a tribal district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, long seen as a haven for militant groups. Among the dead was Assistant Commissioner Faisal Sultan, a senior government officer. District police chief Waqas Rafique said the wounded had been rushed to hospital, with several in critical condition.Although no group has claimed responsibility, officials suspect the Pakistani Taliban, or Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), to be behind the attack. The group has been responsible for a string of recent assaults targeting security personnel and civil servants in the region. TTP is closely linked to the Afghan Taliban and has gained renewed momentum since the fall of Kabul in 2021.This bombing follows a deadly suicide attack last Saturday in North Waziristan, another restive district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where 16 soldiers were killed when a militant rammed an explosives-laden vehicle into a military convoy. That attack was claimed by the Hafiz Gul Bahadur group, a faction of the Pakistani Taliban.Pakistan has seen a surge in militant violence along its western border, with over 290 people mostly security personnel killed in attacks this year alone.","Five people, including a senior local administrator, were killed when a roadside bomb struck a government vehicle in northwestern Pakistan.

MINGORA, SWAT: Torrential rain triggered flash floods that tore through Pakistan’s northwestern Swat Valley over the weekend, killing at least 32 people and laying bare gaps in disaster preparedness in a region once ravaged by Taliban.Twelve members of one family were swept away while picnicking along the river in Swat, witnesses said.

At least 45 people have been killed across Pakistan as heavy rain and flash floods battered multiple regions since the start of the monsoon season, disaster management officials said on Sunday. The death toll includes a large number of children, underscoring the human cost of intensifying climate-related disasters in the country.The worst-hit was the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, bordering Afghanistan, where 21 people, including 10 children, lost their lives. The Swat Valley alone accounted for 14 deaths, where local media reported that a flash flood swept away families gathered near a riverbank.In Punjab, Pakistan’s most populous province located along the Indian border, 13 people have died since Wednesday. Officials said eight of them were children, killed when walls or roofs collapsed during intense rainfall. The remaining victims were caught in sudden floods.Another 11 fatalities have been reported in Sindh and Balochistan, further highlighting the widespread impact of the seasonal downpour.The Pakistan Meteorological Department has warned that heavy rainfall and the risk of flash floods will persist until at least Saturday, urging residents in vulnerable areas to take precautions.This latest tragedy follows a string of extreme weather events in Pakistan. Just last month, 32 people were killed in violent storms, and earlier in the year, the country faced hailstorms and unusual temperature shifts during spring.With a population of over 240 million, Pakistan ranks among the world’s most climate-vulnerable nations. Scientists and disaster experts have repeatedly warned that climate change is accelerating the frequency and severity of extreme weather, putting millions at risk in the region.Rescue and relief efforts are ongoing, and authorities have appealed for public vigilance as the monsoon deepens.","At least 45 people have been killed across Pakistan as heavy rain and flash floods battered multiple regions.

Another earthquake struck Pakistan on Sunday morning, with 4.5 magnitude, said the National Center for Seismology (NCS). This is the second quake that hit the nation in the same dayThe quake occurred at a shallow depth of 10 kilometers, which makes it prone to aftershocks and can cause stronger ground shaking.The NCS shared the details in a post on X, “EQ of M: 4.5, On: 29/06/2025 08:02:51 IST, Lat: 30.24 N, Long: 69.86 E, Depth: 10 Km, Location: Pakistan.”There were no immediate reports of injuries or major damage.

It occurred at a depth of 150 kilometers.Prior to these two events, another earthquake measuring 4.4 on the Richter scale hit the region on June 15. Like Sunday’s later tremor, it was also shallow, recorded at a depth of 10 kilometers.Shallow earthquakes tend to be more dangerous than deeper ones because their seismic waves have less distance to travel before reaching the surface. This leads to stronger ground shaking, which can cause greater structural damage and increase the risk of casualties.Pakistan is among the most seismically active nations in the world, as it is crisscrossed by several major fault lines. As a result, earthquakes occur frequently and are often severe.Geologically, Pakistan sits at the intersection of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates. The provinces of Balochistan, the federally administered tribal areas, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Gilgit-Baltistan lie along the southern edge of the Eurasian plate, while Sindh, Punjab, and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir are located on the northwestern edge of the Indian plate.The ongoing collision between these plates makes the region highly susceptible to powerful earthquakes.","The quake occurred at a shallow depth of 10 kilometers, which makes it prone to aftershocks and can cause stronger ground shaking.

At least 14 soldiers were killed and over 24 others injured in the attack, according to officials.A 'fidayeen' rammed an explosives-laden vehicle into a mine-resistant vehicle belonging to the bomb disposal unit, a source said. The explosion caused widespread damage and the casualties. Security sources said over 500 kg of explosives was used in the attack to breach an ambush protected vehicle.The Hafiz Gul Bahadur (HGB) group, linked to the Afghan Taliban, has claimed responsibility for the attack, attributing it to their ongoing operation 'Khandak'. HGB is a Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) faction operating primarily in North Waziristan and adjacent districts in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's former Federally Administered Tribal Areas region. Led by tribal leader Hafiz Gul Bahadur, the group also maintains ties with the Haqqani Network.In July last year, militants from this group had launched a pre-dawn attack on the Bannu Cantonment in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The fighters breached defences and detonated a vehicle-borne explosive, damaging cantonment infrastructure. Eight soldiers were killed and over 141 injured, including seven civilians.Saturday's VB-IED (vehicle borne-improvised explosive device) attack is the second strike on Pakistan military personnel in a week.

Human trafficking on the rise as online scam hubs go global,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/human-trafficking-on-the-rise-as-online-scam-hubs-go-global/articleshow/122171493.cms,"Representative image

Where are scam centers spreading?

Who are the victims?

Who are the people traffickers?





Human trafficking-fueled scam centers have significantly expanded their operations worldwide, according to a crime trend update released on Monday by the international police agency Interpol.Hubs where trafficking victims are forced to take part in online fraud first emerged in a few Southeast Asian nations, but investigators are now also uncovering similar fraud centers in other regions.According to the international police organization, victims now come from 66 countries across all continents, highlighting what Interpol describes as a "" global crisis "" involving hundreds of thousands of people.Scam centers are now increasingly found in other regions, including the Middle East, West Africa, fast emerging as a new regional hub, and Central America.Victims are often lured with fake job offers and then held captive in scam compounds. Many are blackmailed over alleged debts, beaten, sexually exploited, and in some cases tortured or raped.Inside these centers, they are forced to run online scams, mostly targeting people abroad to steal money.A 2024 Interpol-led operation exposed dozens of cases where victims were coerced into committing fraud, including a raid on an industrial-scale scam centre in the Philippines.That same year, police dismantled a centre in Namibia where 88 youths were forced to scam others.Emerging technologies are fuelling this trend further. The crime update notes a surge in the use of artificial intelligence, from generating fake job ads to creating deepfake profiles for ""sextortion"" and romance scams.Interpol says the pool of those preyed upon has widened significantly.While early human trafficking victims were mainly Chinese-speaking and came from China, Malaysia, Thailand or Singapore, people are now being trafficked to such hubs from South America, East Africa and Western Europe.""Tackling this rapidly globalizing threat requires a coordinated international response,"" said said Interpol's acting head of police services Cyril Gout.The report found that about 90 per cent of human trafficking facilitators came from Asia, while 11% were from South America or Africa.About 80 per cent of these facilitators were men, with 61 per cent aged between 20 and 39.Online scam centers were initially concentrated in Cambodia, with additional trafficking hubs later uncovered in Laos and Myanmar. Today, similar operations have been identified in at least four more Asian countries, and evidence shows the model is spreading to other regions such as West Africa, where cyber-enabled financial crime is already common.In its findings, Interpol warned that the spread of such criminal networks needs urgent, coordinated action to disrupt trafficking routes and support victims.Interpol said that these criminal hubs are increasingly intertwined with other major transnational crimes, demanding a globally coordinated response.Trafficking routes used for scam centers are being exploited for smuggling drugs, firearms, and endangered wildlife like tigers and pangolins, Interpol said.","Human trafficking-fueled scam centers have significantly expanded their operations worldwide.

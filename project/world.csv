Trump freezes US aid to South Africa over land reform law,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-freezes-us-aid-to-south-africa-over-land-reform-law/articleshow/118045005.cms,"South African President Cyril Ramaphosa (left) and US President Donald Trump (Picture credit: AP)

US President Donald Trump signed an executive order Friday halting US assistance to South Africa , citing concerns over a newly enacted land reform law that the White House says discriminates against the country’s white minority.“As long as South Africa continues to support bad actors on the world stage and allows violent attacks on innocent disfavored minority farmers, the United States will stop aid and assistance to the country,” the White House stated in a summary of the order.The executive order references South Africa’s Expropriation Act , signed into law last month by South African President Cyril Ramaphosa. As per the news agency AP, the law grants the government the authority to seize land in specific instances, such as when it is underutilised or when redistribution is deemed in the public interest, to correct historical injustices stemming from apartheid-era land dispossession.However, Trump’s administration claims the law “blatantly discriminates against ethnic minority Afrikaners” and could lead to land seizures without compensation, according to the news agency AFP.Trump’s close ally Elon Musk , who was born in South Africa, has been vocal about the Expropriation Act, calling it a threat to the country’s white minority. Musk has also clashed with the South African government over policies requiring major companies, such as his Starlink satellite internet service, to allocate 30% equity to historically disadvantaged groups, reported AFP.In addition to halting aid, Trump announced plans to establish a resettlement program for white South African farmers and their families, citing concerns over their safety and economic future. “The United States will promote the resettlement of Afrikaner refugees escaping government-sponsored race-based discrimination ,” the executive order states.The aid freeze also comes amid growing US-South Africa tensions on foreign policy. The executive order references South Africa’s role in bringing accusations of genocide against Israel before the International Court of Justice (ICJ), a move that has deepened diplomatic rifts between Washington and Pretoria, as per AP.Additionally, US secretary of state Marco Rubio has announced that he will skip upcoming G20 talks in South Africa, accusing the country’s government of pursuing an “anti-American” agenda.The South African government has dismissed Trump’s claims as misinformation, arguing that the new land law does not authorize arbitrary confiscation but rather aims to correct deeply rooted economic disparities. The law remains a highly debated issue in South Africa, where most farmland is still owned by white citizens despite the end of apartheid three decades ago.",US President Donald Trump signed an executive order Friday halting US assistance to South Africa.

"US missing plane found crashed on sea ice in Alaska, all 10 aboard dead",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-missing-plane-found-crashed-on-sea-ice-in-alaska-all-10-aboard-dead/articleshow/118044687.cms,"US missing plane found crashed on sea ice in Alaska, all 10 aboard dead (Picture credit: AP)

BREAKING: Disappeared Alaska plane wreckage found

The Bering Air commuter plane carrying 10 people, which went missing over Alaska while en route to Nome, was found crashed on sea ice off the western coast of Alaska, authorities confirmed Friday.All nine passengers and the pilot were killed, as per the news agency AP.The US coast guard discovered the Cessna Caravan on Friday during an aerial search near its last known location, about 12 miles offshore and 30 miles southeast of Nome.Two rescue swimmers were deployed to examine the wreckage, as per AP.Radar data from the US Civil Air Patrol indicated the aircraft experienced a rapid loss of altitude and speed around 3:18 pm (local time) Thursday, though officials have not determined the cause.Lt Cmdr Benjamin McIntyre-Coble of the US Coast Guard stated that while the radar data suggests a sudden descent, the exact reason remains unknown. “What that event is, I can't speculate to,” he told reporters.Notably, no distress signals were received from the aircraft before the crash, as per AP.The Cessna Caravan, a single-engine turboprop, was at full passenger capacity, according to Bering Air’s fleet specifications. The flight, which departed Unalakleet at 2:37 pm, was a regularly scheduled commuter service.At the time of the incident, the National Weather Service reported light snow and fog, with temperatures around 17°F (-8.3°C). Western Alaska frequently experiences sudden snow squalls and high winds, particularly in winter, which can pose serious challenges for small aircraft.Search efforts were conducted by local, state, and federal agencies, with aircraft from Bering Air assisting in a grid-pattern search over the coastline. The Coast Guard's MH-60 Jayhawk helicopter first spotted the wreckage on sea ice and deployed rescue swimmers to investigate.Authorities have not yet confirmed whether the plane’s emergency locator transmitter (ELT) was activated. The device, designed to send distress signals upon impact or water exposure, did not transmit any alerts to the Coast Guard.Nome, a historic Gold Rush town and the final stop of the Iditarod sledge dog race is now reeling from the tragedy. Prayer vigils were announced in honour of the victims, their families, and first responders involved in the search.Alaska's US Senators Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan, along with US Representative Nick Begich, expressed condolences. Begich posted on social media that he was ready to assist Governor Mike Dunleavy in supporting Nome and the affected families.With many remote communities lacking road access, air travel is essential for transportation across Alaska. However, harsh winter conditions and rugged terrain increase aviation risks.Bering Air, which serves 32 villages from hubs in Nome, Kotzebue, and Unalakleet, typically runs twice-daily flights to most destinations.The Alaska crash marks the third major US aviation mishap in eight days. On January 29, A commercial jetliner and an Army helicopter collided near Washington, DC, killing 67 people. Another crash happened on January 31, when a medical transport plane crashed in Philadelphia, killing six passengers and one person on the ground.","Bering Air commuter plane carrying 10 people went missing over Alaska while en route to Nome.

"'You’re fired': Donald Trump revokes Joe Biden’s security clearance, cites ‘poor memory’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/youre-fired-donald-trump-revokes-joe-bidens-security-clearance-cites-poor-memory/articleshow/118043701.cms,"File photo: US President Donald Trump (left) and former US President Joe Biden (Picture credit: AP)

US President Donald Trump announced Friday that he is revoking former President Joe Biden’s security clearance and ending his access to intelligence briefings, calling it a direct response to Biden’s decision to do the same to him in 2021.In a post on his social media platform, Truth Social, Trump stated, “There is no need for Joe Biden to continue receiving access to classified information. Therefore, we are immediately revoking Joe Biden’s security clearances, and stopping his daily Intelligence Briefings. He set this precedent in 2021, when he instructed the intelligence community (IC) to stop the 45th President of the United States (me!) from accessing details on national security, a courtesy provided to former Presidents. The Hur Report revealed that Biden suffers from “poor memory” and, even in his “prime,” could not be trusted with sensitive information. I will always protect our national security — Joe, you’re fired. Make America Great Again!”Trump added that Biden had set the precedent by instructing the intelligence community to cut off Trump’s access after leaving office.Biden revoked Trump’s intelligence briefings in 2021, citing concerns over his “erratic behaviour” following the January 6 Capitol attack.At the time, Biden questioned whether Trump could be trusted with sensitive information and was quoted by CBS News saying, “What value is giving him an intelligence briefing? What impact does he have at all, other than the fact he might slip and say something?”.Now, Trump is citing similar concerns over Biden’s cognitive abilities. In his post, Trump referenced special counsel Robert Hur’s report on Biden’s handling of classified documents, which described the 82-year-old’s memory as “poor” and “faulty”.Trump’s decision follows a series of similar moves targeting officials who have opposed him. He previously revoked security clearances of more than 50 former intelligence officials who signed a 2020 letter suggesting the Hunter Biden laptop story had hallmarks of Russian disinformation. According to AP, he also rescinded security details for former officials, including ex-secretary of state Mike Pompeo and Dr Anthony Fauci.By US law, the sitting president has full discretion over whether former presidents receive intelligence briefings. While such access has traditionally been extended as a courtesy, Biden’s 2021 decision marked a break from precedent, which Trump is now following.","US President Donald Trump announced Friday that he is revoking former President Joe Biden’s security clearance and ending his access to intelligence briefings.

A ruckus was reported Friday outside the department of education as Democrat members of Congress attempted to enter the department and were resisted by the security. The department is staring at an imminent shutdown as President Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order to dismantle the agency. Trump reacted to the ruckus and said those who are doing it do not love the country. ""I see Maxine Waters , a low-life,"" Trump said.The Democrats demanded to meet education secretary Denise Carter but was not allowed to. “We are here to ask her, will you comply with an illegal executive order to shut down the Department of Education?” Rep. Mark Takano (D-Calif.) said. “Although the president is determined to shut Congress out of the process, he will not. We will not allow it. We will not cede the responsibility for our future generations to one man, his ideology and his unelected lieutenants.”They were told by security that they should get an appointment for meeting Carter. “They have armed officers acting like we’re dangerous,” Florida 10th District representative Maxwell Frost said in a video he filmed standing outside the Lyndon Baines Johnson Department of Education building. “A year ago, I’d be able to walk into this building and not be locked out.”“This is what they’re doing. Elon is allowed in but not you, not your elected representatives, not parents, not students. Elon can go in, his goons can go in, but not the representatives of the people,” the Florida Democrat added.Frost had an alterction with a man who said he was a federal employee and did not make it clear why the lawmakers had not been allowed into the building. Frost asked the man whether he was doing so of his own volition or had been ordered to block the door, to which the man responded that he was doing his job. Ninety-six members of Congress, led by Rep. Mark Takano, D-Calif., wrote a letter to Carter requesting a meeting. The department acknowledged receipt of the letter but did not set up a meeting.“The protest was organized by members of Congress who were exercising their First Amendment rights, which they are at liberty to do. They did not have any scheduled appointments, and the protest has since ended,” a spokesperson of the education department said.",Members of Congress were stopped from entering the Department of Education.

US Transportation Secretary Duffy expresses willingness to allow Musk to restructure air traffic control,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-transportation-secretary-duffy-expresses-willingness-to-allow-musk-to-restructure-air-traffic-control/articleshow/118035289.cms,"Transportation Secretary Dean Duffy said that US aviation authorities are ready to allow DOGE chief Elon Musk to completely restructure the system.Duffy speaking on Fox's Hannity programme, expressed willingness to allow the efficiency-focused team to develop a fresh air traffic control system at ""the speed of business, not bureaucracy"", citing urgent modernisation needs.This announcement follows the most severe US airline disaster in nearly 25 years, where a Blackhawk helicopter's collision with an American Airlines aircraft resulted in 67 fatalities, including all passengers and crew members.Following his address at a state Department of Transport officials' conference on Wednesday, Duffy elaborated on his decision to involve the space entrepreneur. He informed the host that the Tesla and X executive believes a modernised aviation system could be implemented within just 12 months.""Sean, I was talking to Elon. I said, 'what can we do this in, Elon? Two and a half, three years, can we make this happen?' And he was like, 'No, no. Two and a half, three years. No. We could do this in one year'.""Duffy appears to welcome the involvement of Musk's DOGE team members. ""When you have these 22 year old young people who are smart and can engage and give us good advice, we'll move at the speed of business as opposed to the speed of bureaucracy and government,"" he said.Duffy suggested that Democrats' opposition stems from Musk's participation. ""We're using World War Two technology. And it should have been updated, you know, 10, 20, 30 years ago. And so, again, I think Democrats right now, they're upset about Elon Musk.""Meanwhile Rep.Tim Kennedy (D-N.Y.) expressed serious concerns about Musk's lack of expertise in air traffic control. He emphasised the poor timing, particularly following a recent tragic incident in Washington, DC, stating it would be unwise to grant authority to someone without relevant experience.Additionally, Rep Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), a Transportation Committee member, warned of increased aviation accidents and potential ground operation issues.However, Duffy defended Musk's potential involvement, citing his achievements in space technology, a view apparently shared by Donald Trump.","US Transportation Secretary Dean Duffy says he is ready to allow DOGE chief Elon Musk to completely restructure the system.

The US Senate confirmed Russell Vought on Thursday as the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB), which is involved in a dispute over freezing federal funding for aid programs.Vought was approved by a vote of 53-47 despite opposition from Democrats. Senate Minority leader Chuck Schumer called him ""one of the most fringe and hard-right individuals the Senate has seen in a very long time.""The Thursday night vote followed a marathon effort by Democrats to block the nomination, during which they held the Senate floor with speeches for an entire day and night.

Condoms for Taliban to drag shows in Ecuador: Craziest USAID spends revealed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/condoms-for-taliban-to-drag-shows-in-ecuador-craziest-usaid-spends-revealed/articleshow/118003488.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: AP)

hey liberals - watch this

1. $15 million for condoms for the Taliban

2. $446,000 to promote atheism in Nepal

3. $47,000 for a transgender opera in Colombia

4. $20,600 for drag shows in Ecuador

5. $350 million for a pier in Gaza

6. $1 million to boost French-speaking LGBTQ groups in Africa

7. $3 million for just “being LGBTQ” in the Caribbean

8. $55,000 for a climate change seminar in Argentina—only for female and LGBTQ journalists

9. $2 million for sex changes and LGBTQ activism in Guatemala

10. $425,000 to help Indonesian coffee companies become more “gender-friendly”

11) $32,000 for a transgender comic book in Peru

14) Millions to EcoHealth Alliance—tied to the Wuhan Lab

15) Hundreds of thousands of meals sent to al-Qaeda fighters in Syria

16) Hundreds of millions for Afghan Poppy cultivation

17) $14 million in cash vouchers for migrants at the Southern border

The US Agency for International Development (USAID) is facing heavy scrutiny after Trump administration crackdown.US President Trump, who has long criticised USAID, signed an executive order pausing foreign assistance for 90 days. “USAID is being run by radical lunatics,” he said, vowing to end what he calls “waste, fraud, and abuse.”Meanwhile, secretary of state Marco Rubio had called USAID a “global charity” that operates with little regard for US national interests. The agency’s Washington headquarters has been temporarily closed and several senior officials have been placed on leave as investigations continue.Recently, house foreign affairs committee chairman Brian Mast and the White House exposed a series of, what they referred to as “wasteful” expenditures under the Biden administration.From funding drag shows in Ecuador to providing cash vouchers for illegal migrants, USAID’s use of taxpayer dollars has raised major concerns about its accountability.Here are some of the spending decisions, that the committee termed as “outrageous”:Yes, you read that right. In the video, Representative Mast claimed that USAID allocated $15 million worth of condoms to the Taliban, an extremist group known for suppressing women's rights. He mocked this expenditure, stating, “I don’t think anybody’s going to die because we don’t give the Taliban any more condoms.”Through the state department, USAID funnelled nearly half a million dollars to promote atheism in Nepal.The US government spent tens of thousands of dollars to fund a transgender-themed opera in Colombia, a move that left many questioning its relevance to American interests.Another eyebrow-raising expenditure, USAID paid for drag performances in Ecuador as part of an LGBTQ cultural initiative. According to the foreign affairs committee, Fundación Diálogo Diverso, an LGBTQ organization in Ecuador, received nearly $75,000 over a period of three years, which includes a $25,000 grant from last year. The organization utilized those funds to host a two-day drag workshop and create a video documenting the event.This massive sum was spent to build a pier in Gaza, allegedly to facilitate humanitarian aid. However, critics argue that it could easily benefit terrorist groups like Hamas, according to The National Desk.Through the State Department, USAID funded LGBTQ activism in West and Central Africa with a $1 million grant, despite many African nations rejecting Western-imposed social policies.USAID reportedly spent $3 million to support LGBTQ individuals in the Caribbean with no clear explanation of how the funds were distributed or why the initiative was necessary.A USAID-funded climate seminar in Argentina had a strict requirement: participants had to be female or LGBTQ journalists, raising concerns about inclusivity and fairness.The White House disclosed that USAID provided $2 million to support sex reassignment surgeries and LGBTQ activism in Guatemala, a deeply conservative country.US Taxpayer money was used to promote gender inclusivity within Indonesian coffee businesses, sparking outrage over how such spending aligns with American interests.USAID spent $32,000 to create an LGBTQ-focused comic book in Peru. While it is likely meant to promote inclusivity, critics argue that funding a niche cultural project in South America is a waste of American taxpayer money.USAID has funnelled millions of dollars to EcoHealth Alliance, the organization linked to controversial coronavirus research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.According to The White House, USAID provided food aid that allegedly ended up in the hands of al-Qaeda-affiliated fighters in Syria. Critics argue this demonstrates the agency’s lack of control over where US funds actually go.USAID has reportedly spent hundreds of millions of dollars on irrigation canals, farming equipment, and fertilizer in Afghanistan—resources that directly benefited the Taliban’s heroin trade. The funding helped sustain one of the world’s largest opium networks, undermining US counter-narcotics efforts.While the US faces its own economic struggles, USAID allocated $14 million in cash vouchers to migrants at the southern border. Critics argue this policy incentivises illegal immigration and misuses taxpayer money that could be spent on domestic priorities.","The US Agency for International Development (USAID) is facing heavy scrutiny after Trump administration crackdown.

According to the full transcript, she gave a 140-word response.“Well, let’s start with October 7th. Because obviously, what we do now must be in the context of what has happened. And as I reflect on a year ago, and that 1,200 people were massacred, young people at a festival, at a music festival, 250 hostages were taken, including Americans, women were brutally raped,” Harris began. “And as I said then, I maintain Israel has a right to defend itself. We would. And how it does so matters. And as we fast forward into what we have seen in the ensuing weeks and months, far too many innocent Palestinians have been killed. And we know that, and I think most agree, this war has to end. And that has to be our number one imperative, and that has been our number one imperative.

This order was signed by President Trump on his first day in office and includes a directive for agencies to ""end the Federal funding of gender ideology.""The directives come after the White House's office of personnel management distributed instructions last week to department and agency heads, ordering them to remove references to gender ideology from all official materials, including emails. They were also ordered to take down any websites or other public-facing materials that reference gender identity, and ensure that bathrooms in federal buildings were designated for biological males and females.""In response to the Executive Orders, Nasa has disabled features in id.Nasa.gov and Teams that allows users to add pronouns in their display name in Microsoft Outlook and Teams,"" the email said, as per the NPR report. ""For users who have previously added pronouns to their display name, those pronouns will be automatically removed from the system this week.""The email also announced changes to email signatures. ""Nasa has adopted a uniform signature block for emails that are sent using any Nasa.gov email address. All users (civil servants, contractors, and grantees) must modify their signature block to follow the appropriate signature block… the signature block should not include additional embellishment.""This change is part of Nasa’s effort to comply with the White House's directives regarding content within government systems.According to 404 Media, an independent journalist-founded media website, Nasa employees were also instructed to remove specific terms from public-facing websites, including ""Indigenous people"" and references to women such as ""women in leadership.""","US space agency National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( Nasa ) employees have been directed to remove all pronouns from emails and other applications.

Asteroid hitting earth 2032 NASA: City killer asteroid rushing towards Earth Scientists warn of its impact,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/science/city-killer-asteroid-rushing-towards-earth-scientists-warn-of-its-impact/articleshow/117720000.cms,"What happens if the asteroid makes impact

Determining the threat

Further details

Astronomers have identified a newly discovered asteroid with a small yet alarming chance of colliding with Earth in the next decade. The celestial traveller, named 2024 YR4, is nearly 200-foot-wide and has a 1.2 per cent probability of striking Earth on 22 December 2032 raising concerns about its potential impact, especially if it were to crash in a densely populated area.The space rock, discovered last year, is roughly the same size as the Tunguska asteroid, which in 1908 exploded over Siberia, flattening an estimated 80 million trees across 830 square miles and unleashing a blast equivalent to 50 million tons of TNT.Though the event resulted in only three reported deaths due to its remote location, scientists say that today, a similar impact could have a catastrophic effect, particularly over a major city.After a little less than a decade, 2024 YR4 is expected to pass within 66,000 miles of Earth.However, as the data about its current trajectory remains uncertain, the risk of impact could change in case more data is gathered about it.Due to its potential threat, 2024 YR4 has been added to Nasa’s Sentry risk list, which monitors hazardous near-earth objects (NEOs).Experts say that if 2024 YR4 enters Earth's atmosphere intact, it could either explode mid-air in a fiery air burst or crash into the ground, creating a massive crater. However, the extent of destruction relies on the asteroid’s composition and density, the details which have not been gathered by now.Initial calculations suggest that in case it does collide with Earth, the impact zone, known as the risk corridor—could stretch from South America across the Atlantic Ocean to sub-Saharan Africa, as per the Daily Mail.However, this projection is subject to change as astronomers refine the asteroid’s orbit.The asteroid was first detected on 27 December 2024 by Atlas (Asteroid terrestrial-impact last alert system), a Nasa-funded project that scans the sky for potential threats. Automated warning systems quickly flagged 2024 YR4 as a noteworthy object, rating it a 3 on the Torino risk scale, a level that warrants continued monitoring due to its close approach and over 1 per cent chance of impact.Finding out details about the exact size and composition of 2024 YR4 is difficult as it is currently moving away from Earth, making radar observations impossible. Scientists estimate its diameter at 196 feet, but this depends on its surface reflectivity, which remains unknown.Astronomers hope to study 2024 YR4 more closely when it passes within 5 million miles of Earth in 2028, potentially allowing for radar measurements. Until then, researchers must rely on indirect methods, such as brightness analysis, to refine their estimates.While the risk remains low, the asteroid's classification as a potential impactor has set off a scientific race to understand its true threat level before 2032.","The space rock, discovered last year, is roughly the same size as the Tunguska asteroid, which in 1908 exploded over Siberia, flattening an estimated 80 million trees across 830 square miles and unleashing a blast equivalent to 50 million tons of TNT. 2024 YR4 has been added to Nasa’s Sentry risk list, which monitors hazardous near-earth objects (NEOs)","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117720440,imgsize-1314043,width-400,resizemode-4/117720440.jpg"

Canada’s countermeasures

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has expressed concern that US President Donald Trump ’s repeated remarks about making Canada the 51st US state may not be a joke but a “real thing” driven by the country’s vast critical mineral resources .Speaking at a closed-door business summit in Toronto, Trudeau suggested that Trump is eyeing Canada’s resources as a strategic asset. “Mr Trump has it in mind that the easiest way to do it is absorbing our country.And it is a real thing,” Trudeau was heard saying before a microphone cut off, according to the news agency AP.Trump has made multiple public references to annexing Canada in recent weeks. In the Oval Office, when asked what Canada could do to avoid tariffs, he stated, “What I’d like to see, is Canada become our 51st state.” He also referred to Trudeau as “governor Trudeau” in several posts on his social media platform Truth Social.His administration recently threatened 25% tariffs on all Canadian exports, except energy, which would be taxed at 10%. Trump agreed to a 30-day reprieve on the tariffs after Canada pledged to bolster border security.Canada is home to 31 critical minerals vital for electric vehicle batteries , semiconductors, and clean energy technology. Of those, Canada has prioritised lithium, graphite, nickel, copper, cobalt, and rare earth elements in its strategy to lead the global transition away from fossil fuels, according to the New York Times.François-Philippe Champagne, Canada’s industry minister, emphasised that the US economy is deeply dependent on Canadian supply chains. “This is about a confident Canada,” he said.An Ipsos poll conducted in January found that 80% of Canadians oppose becoming part of the US, with many dismissing Trump’s comments as political bluster, according to BBC. However, Trudeau’s remarks suggest a shift in how Canada views the situation.To fend off tariffs, Canada has introduced a $1.3 billion CAD ($900 million USD) border security plan, which includes drones, helicopters, additional border guards, and a joint US-Canada task force. Trudeau also announced the appointment of a “fentanyl czar” to coordinate efforts, despite Canada contributing to less than 1% of fentanyl smuggling into the US, reported AP.“This is a moment. This is a time in our country’s history that really matters”, Trudeau said.With the 30-day tariff reprieve ticking down, Trudeau emphasized that Canada must be prepared for potential economic retaliation. “We need to be ready to respond robustly,” he said. “We also have to be ready to support Canadians through the responses we’re giving and through a difficult time of tariffs”.As tensions with the US escalate, Canadian business leaders are calling for less reliance on American trade. Candace Laing, President of the Canadian chamber of commerce, said businesses must diversify markets to avoid economic instability.“It’s clear that we can’t just tinker around the edges with incremental steps right now,” she said. “We’ve got to be bold so that businesses and communities can pivot to be more resilient and less reliant on what happens in the US”, she added as per AP.","Justin Trudeau warns Canada must take Donald Trump’s annexation talk seriously. “Mr Trump has it in mind that the easiest way to do it is absorbing our country.

'Normalize Indian hate'



Who is Marko Elez?



What Elon Musk said about Marko Elez



JD Vance says 'bring him back'



Who is Katherine Long? Musk calls her cruel and disgusting



Vice president JD Vance weighed in on the resignation of Marko Elez , a 25-year-old staff of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, whose past social media posts spelt trouble for him and he quit the team. A Wall Street Journal first reported about the resignation and Elez's past posts advocating for racism and eugenics. This snowballed into a major controversy over the background of the youngsters hired by Elon Musk to scrutinize the federal departments -- one went viral for his online name 'Big balls' which was widely reported on television Thursday and Friday -- to Elon Musk's utter disbelief.Elez used @nullllptr as his account to put out problematic thoughts. The account was deleted in December but many posts were archived. “Just for the record, I was racist before it was cool,” the account posted in July. “You could not pay me to marry outside of my ethnicity,” the account wrote on X in September. “Normalize Indian hate,” the account wrote the same month. The Wall Street Journal report said after they inquired about the account and its past posts, White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said Elez resigned from his role.The 25-year-old gained prominence after he got access to sensitive taxpayer information and systems the treasury department uses to process all the payments. Elez has not spoken amid the controversy. The computer science major from Rutgers University, as a sophomore, co-founded a company, Unimetrics.io, that aimed to connect high-schoolers with mentors who could help burnish their college applications. Elez worked at SpaceX, including on Starlink satellites and then he worked for X also before joining DOGE.Elon Musk ran a poll asking his followers if DOGE should rehire the “staffer who made inappropriate statements via a now deleted pseudonym.” Within hours, it had amassed more than 200,000 votes, almost 80% in favor of bringing Elez back.JD Vance said he obviously disagrees with some of Elez's posts, but he doesn't think social media activity should ruin his life. ""We shouldn’t reward journalists who try to destroy people. Ever. So I say bring him back. If he’s a bad dude or a terrible member of the team, fire him for that,"" Vance said.As the DOGE drama unfolded, some conservative social media handles claimed that Katherine Long who wrote the Wall Street Journal article received USAID. ""She's a disgusting and cruel person,"" Elon Musk wrote.""She should be fired immediately,"" Elon Musk wrote replying to a post that linked her to USAID.","Marko Elez, a 25-year-old staff of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, resigned from his role.

Danette Colbert, a 48-year-old woman, was arrested in connection with the shocking death of a Kansas City Telemundo reporter at a New Orleans hotel where he stayed to cover the Super Bowl. The Lousiana woman has a history of drugging men and stealing their credit cards, police said adding that she was captured in the surveillance camera footage of the hotel seen leaving journalist Adan Manzano 's hotel room. From there, she went to stores where she used the journalist's credit card while Manzano was found dead in his room.The cause of the mysterious death is still unknown.Manzano recently lost his wife in a car crash and now his death leaves their toddler daughter without parents. Reports confirmed that his wife Ashleigh Boyd died in Kansas last April.The Jefferson Parish Coroner’s Office is now conducting toxicology testing to determine if Manzano was drugged, police said. His body showed no obvious signs of trauma.Colbert was previously accused of using a credit card that belonged to a man who said the card and his cellphone were swiped after he met a woman drinking on Bourbon Street in New Orleans in 2016, nola.com reported.Police said Manzano's cell phone was also found with 'career criminal' Colbert. Colbert is only charged with fraud and theft-related offenses, but police note that the investigation is still ongoing. It is not immediately clear if she has entered a plea or retained an attorney.Manzano was a sports reporter and anchor for Telemundo KC and Tico Sports from Kansas City. “Adan was an exceptional professional and a rising star whose dedication and talent reflected excellence in his work,” the news station said. “We will deeply miss Adan, his passion for sports and the contributions he made to the local community.”","Danette Colbert, a 48-year-old woman, was arrested in connection with the shocking death of a Kansas City Telemundo reporter at a New Orleans hotel.

NEW YORK: President Donald Trump 's administration is using federal prisons to detain some people arrested in its immigration crackdown, the federal Bureau of Prisons said Friday, returning to a strategy that drew allegations of mistreatment during his first term.In a statement to The Associated Press, the prison agency said it is assisting US immigration and customs enforcement ""by housing detainees and will continue to support our law enforcement partners to fulfill the administration's policy objectives.""The bureau of prisons declined to say how many immigration detainees it is taking in, or which prison facilities are being used.""For privacy, safety, and security reasons, we do not comment on the legal status of an individual, nor do we specify the legal status of individuals assigned to any particular facility, including numbers and locations,"" the agency said.Three people familiar with the matter told the AP that federal jails in Los Angeles and Miami and a federal prison in Atlanta are being used for immigration detention. The people were not authorized to speak publicly and did so on condition of anonymity.An influx of immigration detainees could put yet more strain on federal prisons, which AP reporting revealed have been plagued by severe understaffing, violence and other problems.The bureau of prisons is the justice department's biggest agency with more than 30,000 employees, 122 facilities, 155,000 inmates and an annual budget of about $8 billion. In December, the agency said it was closing one prison and idling six prison camps to address ""significant challenges, including a critical staffing shortage, crumbling infrastructure and limited budgetary resources.""A message seeking comment was left for ICE.Trump has vowed to deport millions of the estimated 11.7 million people in the US illegally. ICE currently has the budget to detain only about 41,000 people and the administration has not said how many detention beds it needs to achieve its goals.Many detainees are taken to ICE processing centers, privately operated detention facilities or local prisons and jails it contracts with.On Thursday, homeland security secretary Kristi Noem said, a second flight of detainees landed at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba. Immigrant rights' groups sent a letter Friday demanding access to people who have been sent to Guantanamo Bay, saying the base should not be used as a ""legal black hole.""White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Wednesday that more than 8,000 people have been arrested in immigration enforcement actions since Trump's January 20 inauguration. Of them, 461 were released for reasons that included medical conditions and lack of detention capacity, she said.ICE averaged 787 arrests a day from January 23 to January 31, compared to a daily average of 311 during a 12-month period ended September 30 during the Biden administration. ICE has stopped publishing daily arrests totals.In 2018, during Trump's first term, the bureau of prisons reached an agreement with ICE and customs and border protection to detain up to 1,600 immigrants at federal prison facilities in Arizona, California, Oregon, Washington and Texas.Six immigrants detained under that arrangement at a medium-security federal prison in Victorville, California, sued Trump, then-attorney general Jeff Sessions, and immigration and prison officials, alleging ""punitive and inhumane"" treatment.The men, who were seeking asylum in the US, accused the bureau of prisons of providing inedible meals and spoiled milk, infringing on their ability to practice their religious faith, allowing only a few hours a week of recreation in the hot sun, and failing to provide adequate medical care.Last October, the American civil liberties union sued the bureau of prisons and immigration authorities under the freedom of information act for records related to the use of federal prisons to detain immigrants during Trump's first term. A conference in that case is scheduled for February 28.An ongoing AP investigation has exposed serious issues in the bureau of prisons, including rampant misconduct, sexual abuse by staff, dozens of escapes, chronic violence, and employees ill-equipped to respond to emergencies because of staffing limitations.Last week, El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele offered to put US immigration detainees and other US prisoners in his country's massive CECOT prison, even American citizens and legal residents. In a post on X, Bukele said he was offering the US ""the opportunity to outsource part of its prison system"" in exchange for a ""relatively low"" fee.Trump says he was open to the idea, but acknowledged it could be legally problematic.""I'm just saying if we had a legal right to do it, I would do it in a heartbeat,"" Trump told reporters Tuesday in the Oval Office. ""I don't know if we do or not, we're looking at that right now.""","The federal Bureau of Prisons says it is assisting US immigration and customs enforcement ""by housing detainees"" The bureau of prisons declined to say how many immigration detainees it is taking in, or which prison facilities are being used.

Policemen at the checkpost offered stiff resistance in an encounter which lasted two hours, following which the terrorists fled,” the provincial police said in a statement.Pakistan has experienced an escalation in militancy in KP, adjacent to Afghanistan, following the collapse of a tenuous truce between TTP and the state in Nov 2022.Pakistani authorities have linked the surge in militant violence to cross-border incursions from Afghanistan, alleging that the Kabul administration is facilitating TTP fighters, a claim Afghan authorities refute. Most of these assaults have been directed at security and law-enforcement personnel, although civilians and govt officials have also been impacted.In KP’s Dera Ismail Khan district last week, four soldiers were killed by gunfire and an improvised explosive device (IED) unleashed by terrorists.In Balochistan, another restive province in Pakistan’s south, 18 soldiers were killed in an attack by terrorists earlier this month.Islamabad think-tank Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) has described 2024 as the most lethal year for security forces in a decade, with a minimum of 685 military and police fatalities resulting from 444 terror attacks.Alongside such attacks, militants have stepped up targeted killings and kidnappings of officials in KP and Balochistan.","Nearly a dozen militants stormed a police check post at Karak district in Pakistan’s restive northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province.

ISLAMABAD : The UN refugees and migration agencies on Wednesday expressed their concern over Pakistan 's decision to deport thousands of Afghan refugees awaiting relocation to the United States and elsewhere.The UN refugee agency, UNHCR , and the international organization for migration in a statement said they were seeking clarification from Pakistan, which said last week it would deport the refugees back to Afghanistan unless their cases were processed quickly by the countries that had agreed to take them in.About 20,000 Afghans were approved for resettlement in the US under a program that helps people at risk because of their work with the American government, media, aid agencies and rights groups. They were among tens of thousands of Afghans who fled to neighboring Pakistan after their country fell to the Taliban in 2021.However, they were left in limbo after President Donald Trump paused US refugee programs last month.""A UNHCR-issued non-return advisory has been in place since 2021, calling for a suspension of forced returns of Afghan nationals from any country regardless of their status,"" the joint UNHCR-IOM statement said.Pakistan's prime minister Shehbaz Sharif last week gave the green light to evict Afghans without papers from the cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi before March 31, in preparation for deportation if they were not relocated to their host countries.UNHCR and IOM said they are especially concerned for Afghan nationals who face a risk of harm upon return, such as ethnic and religious minorities, women and girls, journalists, human rights activists, and members of artistic professions like musicians and others.It said since January 1, 2025, an uptick in arrests of Afghan nationals in Islamabad and Rawalpindi has caused significant distress, with reports of Afghan nationals of various documentation statuses being rounded up.The Trump administration also announced the US refugee admissions program would be suspended from January 27 for at least three months. It has shocked Afghans who were hoping to travel to the United States soon.Afghans in Pakistan have been virtually living in hiding since 2023 when a crackdown began on foreigners who are in the country without proper documentation. An estimated 800,000 Afghans have either gone back voluntarily or been deported since despite criticism from UN agencies, rights groups and the Taliban.Besides thousands of Afghans who are living in Pakistan and awaiting travel to host countries, there are around 1.45 million Afghan nationals registered with UNHCR as refugees in Pakistan as well but their stay has been extended until June.In the statement, UNHCR and IOM urged ""Pakistan to implement any relocation measures with due consideration for human rights standards, including due process, and the legal status of proof of registration (POR) and afghan citizen card (ACC) holders, who have resided in Pakistan for an extended period of time"".""Pakistan has a proud tradition of hosting refugees, saving millions of lives. This generosity is greatly appreciated,"" UNHCR representative in Pakistan Philippa Candler said.""IOM is committed to work with the government of Pakistan and UNHCR to develop a mechanism to register, manage and screen Afghan nationals in Pakistan,"" said IOM chief of mission, Mio Sato.She said ""This will open the door to tailored solutions including international protection to those in need and pathways for Afghan nationals, with long-standing socioeconomic and family ties in the country.""","UN refugees and migration agencies express concern over Pakistan's decision to deport thousands of Afghan refugees.

Pakistani troops fought insurgents who set up roadblocks in the restive northwestern region of Balochistan, leaving 18 paramilitaries and 23 rebels dead, officials said on Saturday. Three other Pakistani soldiers were seriously wounded in some of the heaviest clashes in recent years.The onslaught was claimed by the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), a militant organization behind rising violence in the Balochistan province that borders Afghanistan and Iran.A vehicle carrying unarmed border troops ""came under gunfire from 70 to 80 armed assailants who had blocked the road,"" a police official told the AFP news agency. The official was speaking on the condition of anonymity.The Pakistani military said the casualties occurred after troops engaged the insurgents who erected barricades on a key highway in Kalat, near the border with Afghanistan.The security forces ""successfully removed the roadblock"" following the overnight clashes, the military said in a statement.The military confirmed 18 soldiers died in the operation and vowed that ""the perpetrators, facilitators and abettors of this heinous and cowardly act, will be brought to justice."" Security forces recovered the bodies of 12 insurgents, the military said.Troops also killed another 11 insurgents in an operation that was still underway, the military added.Pakistan's Balochistan province is currently witnessing a surge in deadly attacks, fueled by demands for independence and control over local resources.A Sunni Muslim ethnic group who live on both sides of the Iran-Pakistan border, and also in parts of southern Afghanistan, over 10,000 Baloch have disappeared since 2011, according to Amnesty International.Efforts for autonomy or independence have been met with violent suppression on both sides of the border. In Pakistan, such efforts are viewed as attempts to fragment the nation — while in Iran the situation is further complicated by the Baloch being a Sunni Muslim minority in a predominantly Shiite country.The largest Baloch militant group, the BLA, is backed by the Pakistani Taliban, also known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).The TTP are a separate group from the BLA, with the TTP being allied with the Afghan Taliban.Balochistan is rich in natural resources such as gold, diamonds, silver, and copper — yet the local population remains among the poorest in Pakistan.","Pakistani troops fight insurgents who set up roadblocks in restive northwestern region of Balochistan. 18 paramilitaries and 23 rebels dead, three other Pakistani soldiers seriously wounded in some of the heaviest clashes in recent years.

Bilal Shabbir, Kalat’s deputy commissioner, said the attacks took place in Pidrang, Khazeni and Mangochar Bazaar areas of the town, where militants started conducting snap checks of passenger vehicles passing through town.In the first incident, Shabbir said a van carrying 17 soldiers from Panjgur to Quetta came under attack near the mountainous area of Khazeni, where armed men battled the security forces. He said one soldier of the Frontier Corps (FC), a paramilitary force, was separately killed in clashes with the militants.“The bodies of the slain soldiers were shifted to Quetta,” Shabbir said. “We don’t know how many attackers were killed because they took the bodies of their fighters into the mountains in the dark.”He said three FC personnel were also injured in the attack, adding that militants set a private bank on fire in Mangochar Bazaar.Separatist groups like BLA have long been at the forefront of a low-level insurgency in Balochistan, Pakistan's largest province by area and rich in mineral resources. Separatists claim that Islamabad is abusing the province’s natural wealth while ignoring the local population.In recent months, the BLA has become a major security threat, carrying out large-scale attacks in Balochistan and other parts of Pakistan, targeting Chinese nationals and interests engaged in investment projects, security forces, and ethnic Punjabis they perceive as outsiders in Balochistan.",At least 18 soldiers killed and five injured in Balochistan attacks.

Eighteen paramilitary personnel were killed and three others seriously wounded in an ambush in southwest Pakistan's Balochistan province, local officials confirmed on Saturday.The attack took place near the town of Mangochar, where a vehicle ""carrying unarmed Frontier Corps personnel"" was intercepted by 70 to 80 heavily armed assailants who had blocked the road, a police official told AFP on condition of anonymity.The gunmen opened fire, killing 17 of the passengers on board. A paramilitary who arrived to assist was also killed in the attack.Three others were critically injured, while two managed to escape unscathed.No group has claimed responsibility for the attack so far, but Balochistan has long been plagued by sectarian, ethnic, and separatist violence.The province, which borders Afghanistan and Iran, has seen a surge in attacks in recent months.In January, six people were killed in a bombing claimed by the separatist Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), which has frequently targeted security forces and civilians, particularly those from other provinces.The BLA has also attacked foreign-funded energy projects, including those backed by China, accusing outsiders of exploiting the province’s vast natural resources while neglecting local communities.In November, the BLA took responsibility for a bombing at Quetta’s main railway station that killed 26 people, including 14 soldiers. Just months earlier, in August, the group launched a series of coordinated attacks that left at least 39 people dead, marking one of the deadliest escalations in recent years.Violence has also surged beyond Balochistan, with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province witnessing an increase in militant attacks.The Pakistani military reported that in 2024 alone, 383 soldiers and 925 militants were killed in various clashes.","18 paramilitary personnel killed in ambush in southwest Pakistan's Balochistan province.

In Aug 1975, Mujibur Rahman, his wife and three brothers were assassinated in the house, which was turned into the Bangabandhu Memorial Museum. Murals and busts of Mujibur have also been demolished or defaced across the country.""Respecting the rule of law is what differentiates the new Bangladesh we are working together to build from the old Bangladesh under the fascist regime. Let us not undermine Bangladeshis' sense of security and stability; any disregard for the law endangers the lives and property of citizens,"" Yunus said.For citizens who rose up and overthrew the Hasina regime in July-Aug last year to realise their dreams for the country, it is imperative to ""prove to ourselves and our friends around the world our commitment to our principles..."", the statement said.

""Conflating this with the Government of India’s position is not going to help add positivity to bilateral relations,"" also said the MEA.""While the Government of India will make efforts for a mutually beneficial relationship we expect that Bangladesh will reciprocate similarly without vitiating the atmosphere,"" it added.This comes a day after Bangladesh’s foreign ministry summoned India’s acting high commissioner in Dhaka and lodged a strong protest over statements made by former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina while in exile in India. Bangladesh formally requested India in writing to prevent Hasina from making further remarks, stating that her comments were ""false and fabricated"" and are ""considered as a hostile act"".The recent tensions started when Hasina responded emotionally to the recent vandalism of her father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s house in Dhaka. She condemned the attack, drawing comparisons to history and warning that ""history takes its revenge."" She also urged citizens to resist the current administration, criticizing the destruction of structures linked to Bangladesh’s independence and national identity.","The ministry of external affairs (MEA) summoned Bangladesh's Acting High Commissioner to India, Md.

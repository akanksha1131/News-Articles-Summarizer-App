'If a brown country invaded America…’: YouTuber says other nations would be called ‘terrorists’ for what US did to Venezuela,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/if-a-brown-country-invaded-america-youtuber-says-other-nations-would-be-called-terrorists-for-what-us-did-to-venezuela/articleshow/126342931.cms,"Maduro Op: UNSEEN Video Of Venezuelan Missile 'STRIKING' US Chopper; Trump Admits 'Pretty Bad' Hit





YouTuber Sneako stirred a row after making a provocative post about US foreign interventions, saying that if any other country attacked a foreign nation hastily, it would be called terrorism—but for America, it is considered colonialism.“If a brown country invaded America to bomb DC and kidnap the president for the sole purpose of stealing our oil, we would rightfully call them terrorists. When Americans do it it’s called colonialism,” Sneako said, referring to the US invasion of Venezuela and capture of President Nicolás Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores.Last week, the United States conducted a massive military strike in the Latin American country, launching what President Donald Trump described as a “large‑scale military operation” that included airstrikes in and around Caracas. Maduro and his wife were captured and flown to the United States to face federal charges.Trump announced the operation the opeartion on social media and dubbed it Operation Absolute Resolve. Maduro is set to appear in a Manhattan federal court on charges including narco‑terrorism and drug trafficking.The MAGA circles appreciated the Trump administration's move to invade Venezuela, but Democratic lawmakers cited that the GOP government took steps without congressional approval and called the strikes unconstitutional.Moreover, right-wing influencer Matt Welsh dismissed Sneako's remarks that the US does whatever it wants. Welsh said ""No Brown country"" is capable of attacking Washington. Welsh also agreed upon the views of vice president JD Vance, defence secretery Pete Hegseth that America can use brute force to bring upon justice in any part of the world. He said: ""We're Americans and we actually love our country and want it to succeed. ""One social media user pointed out to Sneako that ""Brown countries have already invaded America and are looting our treasury""","YouTuber Sneako stirred a row after making a provocative post about US foreign interventions.

FULL Q&A: Trump Names VENEZUELA RULERS, Then Faces Grilling On MAGA, Oil Reserves





US President Donald Trump late Sunday issued another stern warning to Venezuela, saying the US would launch another strike “if they don’t behave.” Invoking the Monroe Doctrine, he defended America’s recent Operation Absolute Resolve and the strikes on Venezuela that led to the capture of President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, who were taken into US custody.The strong US military action in Venezuela resulted in the capture of Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, on Saturday, just hours after a dramatic operation unfolded in the capital city of Caracas.Speaking about the strikes in Venezuela and invoking the Monroe Doctrine, Trump said, “It’s about peace on Earth. We’ve got to have peace. It’s our hemisphere. The Monroe Doctrine was very important when it was done, and other Presidents, a lot of them, lost sight of it. I didn’t…”He added, ""I knew the possible danger, it was a very dangerous operation. We had a few injured, but all are in good shape right now...One of the helicopters got hit pretty badly, but we got everything back, and nobody was killed...Don't ask me who's in charge because I'll give you an answer and it'll be very controversial...

"H-1B row: One in three immigrants cancel travel over fear of ICE monitoring, survey finds",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/h-1b-row-one-in-three-immigrants-cancel-travel-over-fear-of-ice-monitoring-survey-finds/articleshow/126342489.cms,"U.S. Rewrites H-1B Rules, Setback To Indian Workers; Check Who Is Eligible & Changes | WATCH





A nationwide survey shows that fear of immigration enforcement is affecting the daily lives of immigrants across the US, with travel emerging as a major concern.About 27 per cent of immigrants said they had avoided trips within the country or overseas to reduce the risk of encounters with immigration authorities.The survey was conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation in partnership with The New York Times in 2025 (August to October). It found that nearly three in ten immigrants altered or cancelled travel plans specifically to avoid drawing attention from immigration authorities. The fear is not limited to undocumented migrants. Many immigrants with legal status, including H-1B visa holders, and even some naturalised US citizens, said they stayed put.Among H-1B visa holders, about one-third reported choosing not to travel due to immigration concerns. The survey showed the impact of recent policy changes. In July, the US State Department ended remote and third-country renewals for H-1B and H-4 visas, requiring applicants to return to their home countries to complete the process. In September, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order imposing a $100,000 fee on new H-1B applications.The administration also expanded social media screening, reviewing applicants’ digital footprint during the vetting process.These measures strained US consulates and embassies, particularly in India. Interview schedules and visa appointments were postponed by nearly a year, and some as far out as 2027. Hundreds of skilled professionals were left stranded in their home countries after travelling for interviews, separated from jobs and families in US.The survey also shows that travel anxiety is not restricted to H-1B holders. Nearly two-thirds of undocumented immigrants reported avoiding travel, both within the US and abroad.The fear comes after reports that the Transportation Security Administration has shared domestic travel information, including passenger lists, with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), according to the American Bazaar. In the past, immigration authorities mostly did not have access to this data. Many immigrants said they are trying to stay under the radar because of closer checks at airports, borders, and other travel points.However, most immigrants said they would still choose to come to the United States if given the chance again, according to the survey.The findings are based on a nationally representative survey of 1,805 immigrant adults currently living in the US.","27 per cent of immigrants said they had avoided trips within the country or overseas to reduce the risk of encounters with immigration authorities.

Right-wing influencer weighs in on Indians earning highest pay in Germany: 'How can a group be so beneficial while...',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/right-wing-influencer-weighs-in-on-indians-earning-highest-pay-in-germany-how-can-a-group-be-so-beneficial-while-/articleshow/126342365.cms,"



Right-wing political analyst Richard Hanania, who has previously said that ""anti-Indian hate is the dumbest form of racism,"" is now praising Indian workers after a recent report showed that they earn the highest median pay in Germany.In a post on X, the influencer said: “Indians win again. How can a group be so beneficial while bringing no harms across so many countries? It’s absolutely awe inspiring.”Hanania has previously defended H‑1B visas and condemned anti‑India hate prevalent in the conservative circles of America. He has even backed Indian-Americans against MAGA bigwigs like former Trump advisor Steve Bannon and Republican leader Ron DeSantis, saying Indians are among the highest earning ethnic groups in US.The comments follow the release of figures showing Indian employees in Germany earned more than any other nationality in 2024.According to a report published by the employer‑linked Institute of the German Economy (IW), the median gross monthly wage for Indian workers reached €5,393. This was higher than the pay for Austrians at €5,322, US nationals at €5,307, and Irish nationals at €5,233.Overall foreign workers in Germany earned a median gross income of €3,204.German workers earned €4,177, which was about €1,200 less than the median pay for Indian employees.The study said Indian nationals earn high salaries mainly because many work in technical and academic jobs. The number of Indians in MINT fields, which cover maths, IT, science and engineering, has grown almost nine times since 2012 to over 32,800.About one-third of full‑time Indian workers aged 25 to 44 were employed in MINT occupations. The trend was supported by a hefty rise in Indian students in Germany. Many of them completed their studies, stayed on, and contributed to research and innovation. The report said that patent applications involving inventors of Indian origin increased twelvefold between 2000 and 2022.IW expert Axel Plünnecke described skilled immigration from India as “a particular success story,"" according to DW.Since 2012, the German government has actively recruited skilled workers from outside the European Union, with a focus on academic and technical professions.

Trump Ally Japan Erupts Against New US Military Base | 'Won't Let Okinawa Turn Into Battlefield'





US President Donald Trump invited Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi to visit the United States during a phone call on Friday, Japan’s foreign ministry said.The foreign ministry added that the two leaders agreed to coordinate arrangements for a spring visit, which would be Takaichi’s first trip to the US since she took office in October. Kyodo News reported that Japanese officials have proposed late March for the visit, with the schedule possibly aligning with Washington’s annual cherry blossom festival.According to Kyodo News, the call lasted about 25 minutes and focused mainly on developments in the Indo-Pacific region. Takaichi told reporters that she and Trump confirmed the strength of the Japan-US alliance and agreed to promote a free and open Indo-Pacific, as well as cooperation among like-minded countries, including the Japan-US-South Korea partnership.However, the White House has not yet confirmed the call or the invitation, according to the AP.“At the start of the new year, I consider it extremely significant that I was able to exchange words directly with President Trump and confirm the strong partnership of the Japan-US alliance,” Takaichi was quoted as saying by Kyodo News.In its statement, Japan’s foreign ministry said the two leaders affirmed they would “carve out a new chapter in the history of the Japan-U.S.alliance” in a year when the United States marks the 250th anniversary of its independence. They also agreed to further deepen wide-ranging cooperation and friendly relations, including in the economic and security spheres.Takaichi said she conveyed her congratulations to Trump on the milestone anniversary. Kyodo News noted that Japan has pledged to gift 250 cherry trees to the United States as part of the commemorations, building on the tradition that began with Tokyo’s 1912 gift of cherry trees to Washington.The call came against the backdrop of strained regional relations between Japan and China. Beijing staged two-day military exercises in waters off Taiwan this week, AP reported. The drills followed the Trump administration’s announcement of a proposed arms sales package to Taiwan valued at more than $11 billion, which, if approved by Congress, would represent the largest such assistance to the island. China criticised the move sharply.China claims sovereignty over Taiwan and has vowed to seize the self-governed island by force if necessary. The United States is required under domestic law to provide Taiwan with sufficient defence equipment to deter any attack from the mainland.Takaichi, Japan’s first female prime minister, angered Beijing late last year when she said Chinese military action against Taiwan could justify a Japanese military response, departing from the strategic ambiguity maintained by previous leaders.Trump met Takaichi in Tokyo in October shortly after she took office and later addressed US troops aboard an aircraft carrier alongside her. After her remarks on Taiwan drew criticism from Beijing, Trump called her and described them as “extremely good friends” and that she should call him anytime, according to the Japanese leader, Kyodo News reported.","US President Donald Trump invited Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi to visit the United States during a phone call on Friday.

Zohran Mamdani Takes Oath On Quran In Historic First As New York Muslim Mayor | WATCH

.





Less than 24 hours after taking the oath, New York City mayor Zohran Mamdani began his first full day in office with a routine familiar to millions of New Yorkers, a morning subway commute from his Queens apartment.Battling against the cold, the 34-year-old Democrat left the one-bedroom apartment in Queens on Friday. Unlike most commuters, Mamdani’s journey was documented by a photo and video crew with neighbors stopping to wish him luck as he headed to work.The subway ride came ahead of a busy first day that included signing orders, announcing appointments and facing questions from the press. Still, the mayor chose to begin with what aides described as a deliberately symbolic commute.Flanked by security guards and a small group of aides, Mamdani boarded a Manhattan-bound train, pausing to take selfies with surprised riders before settling into a corner seat to review briefing materials. The video of his subway ride went viral across social media.When two French tourists, puzzled by the attention, approached him, Mamdani introduced himself as “the new mayor of New York.” When met with disbelief, he held up the morning’s New York Daily News, which featured his photograph on the front page, according to the Associated Press.Videos of the subway ride began circulating online within minutes of Mamdani’s arrival at City Hall, drawing widespread attention and praise from supporters who viewed the moment as a reflection of his campaign message.While the ride served as a carefully timed public moment, it also aligned with Mamdani’s inaugural pledge to ensure his “government looks and lives like the people it represents.”Several past New York City mayors, including Eric Adams, Bill de Blasio and Michael Bloomberg, have similarly used public transit early in their terms to signal accessibility and to connect with the residents.Mamdani’s first commute was followed by a history-making swearing-in ceremony on Thursday. The Indian-origin leader became New York City’s first South Asian and Muslim mayor, as well as the second-youngest mayor in the city’s history, after taking his oath during a private ceremony at the historic Old City Hall subway station.In a first for the city, Mamdani was sworn in on a Quran from the New York Public Library’s Schomburg Center collection, marking the first time a New York City mayor has taken the oath of office on Islam’s holy text.",New York City mayor Zohran Mamdani began his first full day in office with a routine familiar to millions of New Yorkers.

'NO OIL, GOLD FOR US': Maduro’s Deputy Delcy Rodríguez TRASHES Trump’s Solution To Run Venezuela

Who is

Delcy Rodriguez

Delcy Rodriguez is Venezuela’s executive vice president and was directed by the Supreme Court to serve as interim president after Nicolas Maduro was captured during the US military operation.

She is a trained lawyer from Caracas and studied law at the Central University of Venezuela.

Rodriguez has been a senior figure in the chavismo political movement for more than two decades and is regarded as one of Maduro’s closest and most trusted political allies.

She has held several powerful roles in government, including serving as Venezuela’s foreign minister.

Before assuming the interim role, she was also in charge of key economic portfolios, overseeing finance and the country’s oil sector.

She is the sister of Jorge Rodriguez, the president of Venezuela’s National Assembly, and together they have been central figures in the government since the era of former president Hugo Chavez.





Venezuela’s entered a new and uncertain phase on Saturday after President Nicolas Maduro was captured during a US military operation. With no immediate political transition announced, the country’s Supreme Court stepped in, ordering Vice President Delcy Rodriguez to assume the role of interim president, in line with constitutional provisions dealing with a president’s absence.Rodriguez took charge hours after Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were detained. She chaired a meeting of the National Defence Council the same day, appearing alongside senior ministers and military officials.In the meeting, she demanded the immediate release of Maduro and Flores and strongly condemned the US operation. In a televised address, Rodriguez said the early-morning strike violated international law and Venezuela’s sovereignty. She alsocalled on Venezuelans to remain united and urged governments across Latin America to reject what she described as the use of force against a sovereign nation.Rodriguez also insisted that Maduro remains Venezuela’s legitimate president, despite his capture. “There is only one president in this country, and his name is Nicolas Maduro,” she said during the council meeting broadcast on state television.Trump told reporters following Mudaro's capture that Rodriguez was willing to cooperate with Washington. He said she had spoken at length with Rubio and had shown readiness to do “whatever” the US needed.""I think she was quite gracious,"" Trump added. ""We can't take a chance that somebody else takes over Venezuela that doesn't have the good of the Venezuelan people in mind.""",Rodriguez is Venezuela’s executive vice president and was directed by the Supreme Court to serve as interim president.

At least seven loud explosions were heard across Venezuela’s capital, Caracas (early Saturday), with air sirens and low-flying aircraft adding to the alarm. Several neighborhoods reported panic on the streets and power outages following the blasts.According to AFP, the blasts were heard around 2.00 am local time (0600 GMT). The first explosion was recorded shortly before 1.50 am.“One was so strong, my window was shaking after it,” CNN correspondent Osmary Hernández said.Witnesses reported hearing aircraft overhead following the explosions. Smoke was also visible in the southern part of the city near a major military base, according to Reuters. Videos of the explosions quickly surfaced on social media.President Donald Trump confirmed that US had ordered strikes on sites inside Venezuela, including military facilities. Trump also said that Venezuela's president Nicolás Maduro has been captures along with his wife and flown out of the country.The strikes follow months of American military buildup in the region, including the deployment of the USS Gerald R Ford aircraft carrier and several other warships in the Caribbean.The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has banned American commercial flights from operating in Venezuelan airspace, citing concerns over “ongoing military activity,” shortly before a series of explosions were reported in the capital, news agency AP reported.Several areas of Caracas were left without electricity and residents in multiple neighborhoods rushed out onto the streets.Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro, earlier declared a national emergency after a series of explosions rocked the capital Caracas. The government accused the United States of carrying out “military aggression” against civilian and military installations across multiple states. The government further for 'mobilization' of the population after US 'attack', news agency AFP reported.In a government statement, Venezuelan authorities said the US had attacked strategic sites in several parts of the country.The incident comes amid heightened regional tensions, as US President Donald Trump has recently deployed a naval task force to the Caribbean and raised the possibility of ground strikes against Venezuela. In recent days, the US military has also been targeting alleged drug-smuggling boats in the region.The US Embassy in Bogotá has issued travel advisory urging US citizens not to travel to Venezuela. In its warning issued, the embassy said Americans currently in Venezuela should shelter in place and leave the country as soon as it is safe to do so.The embassy reminded citizens that Venezuela is under a Level 4 “Do Not Travel” advisory, the highest warning level, citing severe risks including wrongful detention, torture in detention, terrorism, kidnapping, crime, civil unrest and poor health infrastructure.The US Department of State withdrew all diplomatic personnel from its embassy in Caracas in March 2019 and suspended operations. As a result, all consular services, including emergency assistance, remain unavailable and the US government has no ability to provide help to American citizens inside Venezuela.The advisory also urged US citizens to establish multiple ways of communicating with family and friends outside Venezuela and to closely monitor developments as the situation unfolds.Colombian President Gustavo Petro on Saturday posted an official statement from the Venezuelan government, in which Caracas accused the United States of carrying out a serious military attack on Venezuelan territory.“The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela rejects, repudiates, and denounces before the international community the extremely serious military aggression perpetrated by the current Government of the United States of America against Venezuelan territory and population,” the statement read.The statement claimed the alleged attack violated the United Nations Charter, citing Articles 1 and 2 on respect for sovereignty and the prohibition of the use of force, and warned that such actions “threaten international peace and stability, specifically in Latin America and the Caribbean, and put the lives of millions of people at grave risk.”According to the statement shared by Petro, the Venezuelan government said the objective of the alleged attack was “to seize Venezuela’s strategic resources, particularly its oil and minerals” and to undermine the country’s political independence. “They will not succeed,” the statement added.Earlier, Maduro had claimed that he was open to negotiating with the United States on issues including drug trafficking, oil and migration. Speaking in a pre-recorded interview aired on Venezuelan state television on Thursday, Maduro said he was ready for dialogue with Washington “wherever they want and whenever they want.”However, Maduro also accused the US of using its months-long pressure campaign as a way to force a change in government and gain access to Venezuela’s vast oil reserves.He strongly rejected allegations that his administration is linked to drug cartels, calling the US “war on drugs” a pretext for intervention. Asked directly about President Trump’s claim that American forces had struck a docking facility in Venezuela, Maduro declined to confirm or deny the report, saying it was “something we could talk about in a few days.”On Monday, Trump said the United States had carried out a strike on a “dock area” in Venezuela used by boats allegedly involved in drug trafficking, describing it as a “major explosion.” According to CNN, the blast was caused by a drone strike carried out by the CIA.""There was a major explosion in the dock area where they load the boats up with drugs. We hit all the boats, and now we hit the area... it's the implementation area,"" Trump said.The remarks came as the US military has intensified operations against suspected drug-smuggling vessels in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific.Since September, American forces have carried out more than 30 strikes on boats they say were involved in narcotics trafficking, resulting in over 110 deaths, according to US officials. The latest attack, reported earlier this week, killed five people aboard two boats, the US military said.Trump has repeatedly accused Maduro of flooding the US with drugs and migrants, claims the Venezuelan leader strongly denies. He has also doubled the reward for information leading to Maduro’s capture and threatened to designate his government as a Foreign Terrorist Organisation.","At least seven loud explosions heard across Venezuela’s capital, Caracas (early Saturday), with air sirens and low-flying aircraft adding to the alarm.

Where Bahrain fits in the Gulf landscape





For years, the UAE and Saudi Arabia have dominated conversations around long-term residency in the Gulf. But Bahrain has been moving steadily in the same direction, aligning itself with a wider regional push to attract capital, skills and long-term residents as Gulf economies look beyond oil dependence.Across the region, governments are reworking visa systems that were once built around short-term labour. The aim now is retention, of investors, professionals, entrepreneurs, families and retirees who can contribute over decades, not just contracts. Residency has become an economic tool, not just an immigration one.Bahrain’s Golden Residency Visa, introduced in 2022 and updated in 2025, fits squarely into this shift. Linked to Bahrain Vision 2030, the programme is designed to strengthen the kingdom’s competitiveness and widen its appeal beyond energy, positioning Bahrain as an affordable, stable and expat-friendly Gulf hub for investors, professionals and families looking to base themselves in the region long term.At its core, Bahrain’s Golden Residency is a 10-year renewable residency permit that grants long-term security and operational freedom.Unlike traditional Gulf visas, it is not tied to a single employer and does not impose rigid stay requirements.Key features include:This framework is designed to support long-term settlement rather than short-term labour rotation, aligning with Bahrain’s broader economic strategy.Bahrain’s Golden Residency is deliberately multi-track. Eligibility is assessed through investment, income, or contribution, rather than a single capital test.The property pathway remains the most clearly defined route.The lowered threshold places Bahrain among the more accessible long-term residency options in the GCC, particularly for investors priced out of higher-cost markets.Beyond capital, Bahrain’s model reflects the GCC-wide move toward recognising non-financial contribution.This route applies to:Approval under this route is contribution-based rather than investment-based, but carries the same 10-year renewable residency and work freedoms.Bahrain is one of the few Gulf states with clearly defined residency options for retirees.This clarity has made Bahrain particularly attractive to retirees seeking long-term Gulf residence without employment dependency.All applicants must meet standard Golden Residency conditions:Golden Residency holders may sponsor spouses, parents, and dependent family members. Importantly, there is no minimum stay requirement to preserve residency.Bahrain does not operate a citizenship-by-investment programme. Citizenship remains subject to strict naturalisation rules, requiring prolonged residence, language proficiency, cultural integration, and government approval.While long-term residency offers stability and permanence, investors seeking passport mobility typically look to alternative citizenship programmes elsewhere.The Bahraini passport itself provides visa-free access to 95 destinations, including all GCC states, but remains more limited globally than European or Caribbean passports.Also read: UAE Golden Visa or Saudi Premium Residency; which Gulf nation offers the best long-term future? Bahrain’s appeal as a long-term base rests on a combination of practical advantages. The Golden Residency offers work freedom, family sponsorship and long-term security within a country that remains affordable by Gulf standards. Living costs, particularly housing, are lower than in neighbouring markets, while tax policy favours individuals through zero personal income tax. A large expatriate population, strong international schooling options, high safety rankings and a diversified, business-friendly economy make Bahrain a realistic option for professionals, investors and families seeking stability in the region.Bahrain’s tax environment remains one of its strongest attractions for long-term residents. The kingdom imposes zero personal income tax, meaning individuals do not pay tax on salaries, wages, capital gains or inheritance, a structure that significantly improves net earnings for professionals and retirees alike.That said, Bahrain is not entirely tax-free. A standard 10 per cent value-added tax currently applies to most goods and services, alongside excise taxes on specific items, including a 100 per cent levy on tobacco and energy drinks and 50 per cent on carbonated beverages. For most residents, however, the absence of personal income-based taxation remains the defining advantage.Affordability is where Bahrain quietly outperforms many of its neighbours. According to Numbeo’s 2025 Cost of Living Index, Bahrain ranks as the second most affordable country in the GCC after Oman.Monthly living costs for a family of four are estimated at BHD 1,076.1 (approximately USD 2,855), while a single person’s monthly expenses average BHD 304.3 (around USD 808). Bahrain is 25.3% cheaper than the UAE, with rental costs nearly 65% lower, and remains marginally cheaper than Saudi Arabia for both families and individuals. This affordability, particularly in housing, is a key reason Bahrain appeals to long-term residents rather than short-term workers.Bahrain is a majority-expatriate country by population today. Official figures for 2024 officially place the total population overall at 1,588,670, of which 739,736 are Bahraini nationals, accounting for 46.6 per cent, while 848,934 residents, or 53.4 per cent, are non-Bahrainis. Large expatriate communities include Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, Filipinos, Egyptians and Europeans, shaping a distinctly diverse international vibrant social fabric.For families, Bahrain offers a strong education ecosystem. The country hosts over 70 private international schools, offering British, American, IB and Indian curricula. Costs vary widely, allowing families to choose between affordable and premium options within a relatively compact geography.Bahrain performs strongly across global development, safety and livability benchmarks. It ranks 38th worldwide on the UN Human Development Index 2025, with an HDI score of 0.899, placing it in the “very high” category and third in the Arab region. Safety indicators are similarly robust: Numbeo’s 2025 data ranks Bahrain as the 16th safest country globally, citing low crime levels and a strong perception of personal safety, including when walking at night. In expatriate sentiment surveys, Bahrain has also retained the top global ranking in InterNations’ Expat Insider report for the second consecutive year, reflecting high satisfaction with ease of settling in, social life and overall quality of living.Bahrain continues to actively market itself as a practical and cost-effective business base within the Gulf, particularly for companies that highly value regulatory clarity and regional access over scale alone. The country’s business framework offers several structural advantages:Taken together, these factors make the Golden Residency especially attractive for founders, consultants and small-to-medium enterprises seeking a Gulf presence without the high overheads associated with larger regional hubs.Also read: Saudi Arabia Premium Residency (Green Card); benefits, eligibility, fees, all you need to know Bahrain does not match the scale, capital depth or global profile of the UAE or Saudi Arabia, and it does not attempt to. Instead, it is deliberately moving in the same strategic direction, opening long-term residency beyond investment alone while lowering barriers to entry and focusing on affordability, work freedom and livability. With expatriates making up more than half its population, including large South Asian communities, Bahrain has long functioned as a migrant and expat society. Tax-free income, reasonable living costs, employment across finance, construction and technology, and a comparatively relaxed, family-friendly culture explain why its residency model works in practice rather than just on paper.","Bahrain offers long-term residency with lower investment thresholds and fewer financial barriers to entry.

Clear restrictions and religious guidelines

Repeal of previous rules and broader implications









Saudi Arabia has unveiled a detailed framework governing how public facilities across the Kingdom are named. The regulations, recently approved by the Saudi Cabinet and published in the Umm Al-Qura Gazette, aim to unify naming practices, strengthen administrative oversight, and ensure compliance with Islamic principles. They are set to come into force 120 days after publication and will apply to all publicly owned facilities nationwide.According to Saudi Gazette, the new rules define public facilities broadly, covering municipal buildings, educational institutions, cultural centres, sports venues, religious sites, healthcare establishments, transport infrastructure, and other government-owned assets. Each government entity will be responsible for naming facilities under its jurisdiction, following the unified framework and relevant laws.To implement the system, entities must issue their own executive bylaws. These internal regulations will outline organisational, technical, procedural, and operational requirements, while also setting governance mechanisms to oversee naming decisions.The regulations introduce strict prohibitions on certain naming practices. Public facilities cannot be named after Kings of Saudi Arabia, Crown Princes, or leaders of allied nations without explicit approval from the King.Names that contradict Islamic Sharia are also strictly forbidden. Additionally, the rules set limits on the use of the Names of God. Only seven names are permitted for public facilities: Al-Salam, Al-Adl, Al-Awwal, Al-Nur, Al-Haqq, Al-Shahid, and Al-Malik.When naming a facility after an individual, authorities must verify the person’s integrity. This includes reviewing their intellectual orientation, criminal history, and security record, in coordination with relevant bodies. The chosen name must reflect the individual’s status and public standing appropriately.The Ministry of Municipalities and Housing will issue official naming categories after consulting relevant authorities. All government entities are required to comply with these classifications. The final approval of any facility name rests with the head of the respective entity, who may delegate this authority if needed.The regulations also permit the use of numerical designations, either on their own or alongside names, offering flexibility in naming conventions. To ensure coordination and consistency, each entity must maintain a comprehensive database of all public facility names under its jurisdiction. These records must be updated regularly and shared annually with the General Authority for Survey and Geospatial Information.The new framework replaces earlier provisions regarding the naming of streets and squares and overrides any regulations that conflict with the updated rules. This initiative forms part of wider efforts to modernise administrative practices, standardise public naming, and reinforce alignment with religious principles, governance requirements, and national identity.By establishing these clear and detailed guidelines, Saudi Arabia aims to create a unified, transparent, and culturally consistent approach to naming public facilities, ensuring that every decision carefully reflects the Kingdom’s values and administrative standards","The regulations aim to unify naming practices, strengthen administrative oversight, and ensure compliance with Islamic principles.

Trump To Capture Khamenei After Maduro? Elon Musk's 'Brutal Reality Check' As Riots Kill 16 In Iran





President Donald Trump and Elon Musk seem to have begun their new year on a positive note, appearing to have mended their strained relationship. On Sunday (local time), Tesla CEO took to X and wrote, “Had a lovely dinner last night with @POTUS and @FLOTUS,” adding, “2026 is going to be amazing!”The photograph, taken at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida, fuelled speculation that the pair’s much-discussed bromance may be back on after months of public friction.Following the 2024 election campaign, Musk emerged as one of the Republican Party’s largest donors, contributing hundreds of millions of dollars. Trump later appointed him to advise a government efficiency drive and to help set up the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), aimed at cutting federal spending and streamlining operations.Musk, however, stepped back from the role in mid-2025 amid growing criticism. Relations soured further when he openly attacked Trump-backed spending proposals, warning about ballooning federal outlays. “I’m sorry, but I just can’t stand it anymore,” Musk wrote in a June 3 post criticising Trump’s so-called “big beautiful bill,” calling it a “massive, outrageous, pork-filled” measure and a “disgusting abomination. ”Trump responded by saying he was “very disappointed” by Musk’s remarks, adding, “Elon and I had a great relationship.I don’t know if we will anymore.”Musk fired back on X, claiming that without his support Trump would have lost the election, and at one point even floated the idea of launching a new political party.By late 2025, however, both appeared to soften their stance. In September, Trump and Musk were seen shaking hands at conservative activist Charlie Kirk’s memorial service at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.Musk also attended a White House dinner in November, hosted by Trump for Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman , signalling a tentative thaw in ties.","President Donald Trump and Elon Musk seem to have mended their strained relationship.

No Maduro, No Successor: Delcy Rodríguez Now Rules Venezuela; New Pres. That Toppled Trump’s Plan





US President Donald Trump has warned Venezuela’s current leader, Delcy Rodriguez, that she could face harsher consequences than former president Nicolas Maduro if she did not cooperate with the United States.Speaking in a telephone interview with The Atlantic on Sunday, Trump said Rodriguez would “pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro” if she failed to “do what’s right”.The comments came a day after Trump had publicly praised Rodriguez, following a dramatic US operation in which American forces seized Maduro and his wife from the Venezuelan capital, Caracas.Rodriguez had said Venezuela would defend its natural resources, a remark that appeared to have hardened Trump’s tone. ""We are ready to defend Venezuela; we are ready to defend our natural resources,"" after US President Donald Trump said Washington intends to ""run"" the Caribbean nation and tap its huge oil reserves.Trump earlier told reporters following Mudaro's capture that US would ""run the country until a safe, proper and judicious transition"" can be ensured, a remark later contradicted by secretary of state Marco Rubio.Trump further said Rodriguez was willing to cooperate with Washington.He said she had spoken at length with Rubio and had shown readiness to do “whatever” the US needed.""I think she was quite gracious,"" Trump added. ""We can't take a chance that somebody else takes over Venezuela that doesn't have the good of the Venezuelan people in mind,"" he said.The Venezuelan court soon appointed Rodriguez as the interim president in line with the US constitution. In her speech soon after Mudaro's capture, Rodriguez rejected the US action outright. She demanded the immediate release of Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, and called the military operation a violation of international law.“There is only one president in this country, and his name is Nicolas Maduro,” Rodriguez had said, standing alongside senior civilian leaders and top military commanders.","US President Donald Trump has warned Venezuela's current leader, Delcy Rodriguez, that she could face harsher consequences than former president Nicolas Maduro.

What is Temporary Protected Status (TPS)?





Venezuelans in the US under Temporary Protected Status can now apply for refugee status, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said on Sunday after TPS for the country ended.Speaking on Fox News Sunday, Noem defended the Trump administration’s decision to end the Biden-era TPS designation for Venezuelans, arguing that the measure ensures US immigration programs follow the law. “Venezuela today is more free than it was yesterday,” she said.She added: “Every individual that was under TPS has the opportunity to apply for refugee status. We need to make sure that our programs actually mean something, and that we’re following the law.”Noem’s comments come after the US military captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores. She said that US wants a Venezuelan leader who is going to partner with America against drug trafficking and terrorism.Roughly 600,000 Venezuelans legally residing in the US under TPS now face potential deportation to a country whose government remains unstable. Noem said that those affected can now seek refugee status. She said that the termination of TPS was first introduced in 2021 under the Biden administration and was a nationwide decision after the designation was deemed “contrary to the US national interest.”The move stirred a row, particularly in Florida, which is home to over half of Venezuelan TPS holders.Miami Mayor Eileen Higgins called the revocation “reckless, dangerous, and wrong,” urging the administration to reinstate protections.Some Venezuelans celebrated Maduro’s ouster in Miami, while others remained at home, fearing immigration raids. Adelys Ferro of the Venezuelan-American Caucus said, “We are victims of the Nicolás Maduro regime, but we are also victims of the Trump administration policies.”Temporary Protected Status (TPS) is a US immigration program that allows nationals from certain countries experiencing armed conflict, natural disasters, or other harsh conditions to live and work in in US temporarily. It was created in 1990 under the Immigration Act of 1990.TPS does not provide a path to permanent residency or citizenship. The designation is reviewed and can be extended or terminated by DHS.Under the Trump administration’s order, Venezuelans stripped of TPS can now use refugee status as a legal pathway to remain in US, but still face deportation risk.","Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Venezuelans under Temporary Protected Status can now apply for refugee status.

Why was India excluded from the list?





US President Donald Trump on Sunday shared data showing the rates at which immigrant households from various countries receive welfare and public assistance in the United States. However, the GOP leader did not mention India in the list despite mentioning most of its neighbours, including China, Pakistan and Bangladesh.The chart was titled “Immigrant Welfare Recipietnt Rates by Country of Origin,” and was posted on Trump’s Truth Social platform and covers about 120 countries and territories. It lists the percentage of households receiving some form of government assistance for immigrants born in each country.Here are the top 10 and bottom 10 countries, according to the data.According to the data provided by US president, India's neighbours, Bhutan received 81.4%, Bangladesh 54.8%, Pakistan 40.2%, and Nepal 34.8%.The chart does not explain why certain countries were omitted or the specific types of assistance covered.India is not included in the chart because Indian immigrants have one of the lowest rates of welfare use among all immigrant groups, likely well below the apparent 25 per cent threshold for inclusion.Indian-American households have very high median incomes, over $151,000 per year on average in 2023, and immigrant-headed households earn around $156,000. This is largely due to selective immigration policies, such as H-1B visas, high levels of education, and employment in professional fields like technology, medicine, and engineering. These factors mean Indian immigrants are largely self-sufficient and rarely rely on government programs such as Medicaid or food assistance. As a result, India ranks far below the countries on the chart and is excluded from a list focused on higher welfare usage.","US President Donald Trump on Sunday shared data showing the rates at which immigrant households from various countries receive welfare and public assistance in the United States.

Rubio Grilled, Dubbed 'Viceroy Of Venezuela' On LIVE TV After US Captures Maduro, Trump Declaration





US secretary of state Marco Rubio suggested Sunday that the US would not take a day-to-day role in governing Venezuela other than enforcing an existing “oil quarantine”, a turnaround after President Trump announced a day earlier that the US would be running the country following the capture of President Nicolas Maduro.The softening came even as Trump threatened that Venezuela’s vice-president Delcy Rodriguez, who took over the interim presidency, will pay a “very big price” if she doesn’t cooperate with the US. Rodriguez struck a defiant note, saying, “there is only one president in Venezuela, and his name is Nicolas Maduro”.Venezuela’s defence minister on Sunday rejected any notion that the US would “run” his country, projecting an official line of defiance as the Trump administration said it would seek to exert “leverage” over the country’s leadership. Venezuela’s vice president Delcy Rodriguez assumed the interim presidency on Sunday and struck a defiant note. “There is only one president in Venezuela, and his name is Nicolas Maduro. We will never again be a colony of any empire,” she said.The White House has said it believes that the interim leader will fall in line and largely comply with its demands. The nature of the private conversations between Venezuela’s govt and US officials is unclear.Publicly, Rodriguez and the defence minister, Vladimir Padrino Lopez, have said the govt that was in place under Maduro is still in charge. In a fiery speech broadcast Sunday on state television, Padrino Lopez channelled decades of Venezuelan nationalism and said that the country’s armed forces would “continue to employ all its available capabilities for military defence, the maintenance of internal order and the preservation of peace. ” “Our sovereignty has been violated and breached,” he said, backed by uniformed soldiers. Lopez also said that US forces had killed a “large part” of Maduro’s security detail in the raid that apprehended him, part of a death toll of soldiers and civilians that rose to 80 on Sunday.Maduro is in a Brooklyn jail with his wife, who were both indicted on federal drug trafficking and weapons charges. They are expected to make their initial appearances in federal court on Monday.In a series of television appearances on Sunday, the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said that the US military would maintain a “quarantine” around Venezuela to prevent the entry and exit of oil tankers under American sanctions. But though President Donald Trump has said the US intends to “run” Venezuela and reclaim American oil interests after ousting Maduro, Pentagon officials said that there were currently no US military personnel in the country.In an interview with CBS News’ “Face the Nation,” Rubio said that the large US naval force amassed in the Caribbean Sea off Venezuela will remain “until we see changes, not just to further the national interest of the US, which is No. 1, but also that lead to a better future for the people of Venezuela.”Rubio also said the US is ready to work with Venezuela’s remaining leaders if they make “the right decision”. He appeared to significantly soften President Trump’s extraordinary statements on Saturday that the US will “run” Venezuela and that he would not be afraid to put military “boots on the ground”.

How much oil does it produce?

'Will Sell To China, Russia': Trump Lays Out Plans For Venezuelan Oil After Maduro Capture

What is the state of the oil industry in Venezuela?

Are any Western oil companies involved there?

What would US control of

oil production mean?





Venezuela's oil industry would ""make a lot of money"" with the US behind it, President Donald Trump said Saturday in a news conference. ""We're going to have our very large US oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure, and start making money for the country,"" Trump said. He said the Venezuelan oil industry had been ""a total bust,"" for a long time, adding, ""They were pumping almost nothing by comparison to what they could have been pumping."" Trump seems to be counting heavily on US intervention in the oil industry to help transform Venezuela, a proposition that could prove to be expensive.Venezuela claims to have more than 300 billion barrels in the ground, the largest reserves of oil of any country. But it struggles to produce about 1 million barrels a day, or around 1% of global production. In addition, much of Venezuela's oil is extra heavy, making it polluting and expensive to process.The industry has seen some recovery in recent years, but output is well below the more than 2 million barrels a day that Venezuela was producing in the early 2010s. The national oil company, known as PDVSA, lacks the capital and expertise to increase production.The country's oil fields are run down and suffer from ""years of insufficient drilling, dilapidated infrastructure, frequent power cuts and equipment theft,"" according to a recent study by Energy Aspects, a research firm.Chevron is the main Western oil company still operating in the country and produces about a quarter of Venezuela's oil. Early in this century, when other companies were forced out, Chevron stayed, figuring that conditions might eventually improve. Roughly half of Chevron's production is exported to the US.In theory, if US-based oil companies were given greater access in Venezuela, they could help gradually revive the oil industry. ""But it isn't going to be a straightforward proposition,"" said Richard Bronze, head of geopolitics at Energy Aspects. Analysts say increasing Venezuelan production will not be cheap. Energy Aspects estimated that adding another half a million barrels a day of production would cost $10 billion and take about two years. Major increases might require ""tens of billions of dollars,"" the firm said. The overthrow of govt may offer opportunities for US firms, but they could also find themselves into a messy situation, analysts say.","Venezuela claims to have more than 300 billion barrels in the ground, the largest reserves of oil of any country.

The ego is unmatched.”Mamdani is a socialist Democrat leader who had condemned the operation in Venezuela and described it as “an act of war and a violation of federal and international law.” At a news conference, he said he had spoken directly with Trump to register his opposition to the capture and the US attempt to effect regime change in Venezuela.“I called the president and spoke with him directly to register my opposition to this act and to make clear that it was an opposition based on being opposed to a pursuit of regime change, to the violation of federal international law and a desire to see that be consistent each and every day.I registered my opposition, I made it clear and we left it at that,” Mamdani said.Trump announced Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, had been captured following a “large scale strike” after months of US actions targeting suspected drug shipments linked to Venezuela.Mamdani also talked about how the invasion could impact New Yorkers, particularly the city’s Venezuelan community. “This blatant pursuit of regime change doesn’t just affect those abroad, it directly impacts New Yorkers, including tens of thousands of Venezuelans who call this city home. My focus is their safety and the safety of every New Yorker, and my administration will continue to monitor the situation and issue relevant guidance,” he said.Republicans and GOP bigwigs compared the mayor’s left-leaning policy agenda to Maduro’s socialism and accused him of supporting his “Commie friend.”",New York City mayor Zohran Mamdani criticised for contacting President Donald Trump about the US military capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.

The United States will not take a day-to-day role in governing Venezuela, secretary of state Marco Rubio said on Sunday, clarifying President Donald Trump ’s earlier comments that US would “run” the country following the capture of Nicolás Maduro.Rubio said the US would continue to enforce an existing “oil quarantine” on sanctioned Venezuelan tankers and use that leverage to press for policy changes, reports the Associated Press.“They will continue enforcing the oil blockade, which was already in place, and use it to press for policy changes in Venezuela,” Rubio said.“And so that’s the sort of control the president is pointing to when he says that,” Rubio told CBS News.Rubio claimed Trump’s intent had been misunderstood: “The whole foreign policy apparatus thinks everything is Libya, everything is Iraq, everything is Afghanistan. This is not the Middle East. And our mission here is very different. This is the Western Hemisphere.”Trump had earlier said that the US would “run” Venezuela until a “safe, proper and judicious transition” could be ensured. He said that American oil companies would fix Venezuela’s “badly broken infrastructure” and start generating income for the country.The comments followed an intense US operation on Saturday that led to the capture of Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores. Maduro and Flores were removed from Caracas by US forces, flown aboard the USS Iwo Jima in the Caribbean, and later transported to New York’s Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn.The pair face charges in the Southern District of New York, including conspiracy to commit narco-terrorism, cocaine importation, possession of machine guns and destructive devices, and conspiracy to possess such weapons.Maduro has consistently denied being a cartel leader and accused the US of using its “war on drugs” as an excuse to seize Venezuela’s oil reserves, which amount to around 303 billion barrels of crude, nearly 20 per cent of the world’s total, according to the US Energy Information Administration.Despite Trump’s claims of running the country, the administration has still not decided on what form US management or any kind of regime change would take. “We’re going to be running it with a group, and we’re going to make sure it’s run properly,” he said.Venezuela’s Vice President Delcy Rodríguez has since been sworn in as interim president by the Venezuelan Supreme Court and said she would do “whatever the US asks.” However, Rodríguez also called Maduro the “only one president in Venezuela” on state television.The 'Operation Absolute Resolve' involved explosions around Caracas and targeted strikes on military bases. US aircraft flew over the city for more than two hours as special forces entered Maduro’s safe house to remove him.","Rubio said the US would continue to enforce an existing “oil quarantine” on sanctioned Venezuelan tankers. “They will continue enforcing the oil blockade, which was already in place, and use it to press for policy changes in Venezuela,” Rubio said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126339997,imgsize-814053,width-400,resizemode-4/126339997.jpg"

ISLAMABAD: The polio vaccination campaign in Pakistan's merged districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa fell short of its target, leaving over 935,000 children under five unvaccinated, officials said, citing security challenges and population displacement as key hurdles, The Express Tribune reported.According to The Express Tribune, citing authorities, thousands of families from North and South Waziristan, Bajaur, and other merged districts have migrated to different parts of the country, complicating monitoring and vaccination efforts.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Khyber Pakhtunkhwa reported 19 polio cases in 2025, including four each in North Waziristan, Lakki Marwat, and Tank; three in Bannu; two in Torghar; and one each in Dera Ismail Khan and Lower Kohistan, as reported by The Express Tribune.Officials noted that staffing and operational support for WHO and Unicef programmes in the merged districts were reduced last year, while WHO funding cuts also affected campaign coverage, leaving children in these areas at heightened risk.In Sindh, more than 12,000 children under five were reportedly missed during the final polio drive of 2025 in Hyderabad and surrounding areas, according to The Express Tribune.Refusals were recorded mainly in Cantonment areas and municipal towns such as Hussainabad, Preetabad, Qasimabad, and Tando Jam, with absent households and parental refusals cited as primary reasons.Despite these gaps, the nationwide anti-polio campaign successfully vaccinated more than 44.6 million children across Pakistan, according to The Express Tribune.Punjab led with 22.9 million children vaccinated, followed by Sindh with 10.6 million, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with 7.15 million, and Balochistan with 2.58 million.Officials said contributions from other regions also added to the national tally.Authorities warned that without sustained vaccination efforts, particularly in displaced and high-risk populations, children in the merged districts remain vulnerable to polio, The Express Tribune reported.","Polio vaccination campaign in Pakistan's merged districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa fell short of its target.

Open Letter From Pakistan Backs India As Baloch Leader Signals Diplomatic Break With Islamabad





Baloch leader Mir Yar Baloch has raised a “serious threat” warning over deepening China–Pakistan ties, claiming that China could deploy its military forces in Pakistan’s Balochistan region in the coming months.In an open letter to external affairs minister S Jaishankar, posted on X on New Year’s Day, Mir Yar Baloch said Baloch representatives view the growing strategic partnership between Islamabad and Beijing as “dangerous.”He said Balochistan has “faced decades of repression under Pakistan’s control,” including what he described as “state-sponsored violence” and “human rights abuses.”""The people of Balochistan have endured Pakistan's state occupation, state-sponsored terrorism, and egregious human rights atrocities for the past seventy-nine years. The time has now arrived to eradicate this festering affliction at its roots, ensuring lasting peace and sovereignty for our nation, "" he wrote.In his letter to EAM Jaishankar, Mir Yar Baloch said that China and Pakistan are rapidly moving toward the final stages of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a major Belt and Road Initiative project led by Chinese President Xi Jinping that passes through Balochistan.“The Republic of Balochistan views the escalating strategic alliance between Pakistan and China as profoundly dangerous.We warn that China, in collaboration with Pakistan, has advanced the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) to its final phases,” he said.He warned that unless Baloch resistance and defence forces are strengthened, the region could soon see direct Chinese military involvement.“Should the capabilities of Balochistan's defense and freedom forces not be further bolstered and if they continue to be overlooked as per longstanding patterns, it is conceivable that China could deploy its military forces in Balochistan within a few months,” the letter stated.Mir Yar Baloch also said that any Chinese troop deployment without the approval of the local people could have serious consequences for the region.“The presence of Chinese boots on Balochistani soil without the will of the 60 million Baloch people would pose an unimaginable threat and challenge to the futures of both Bharat and Balochistan,” he wrote.China and Pakistan have repeatedly rejected claims that CPEC has a military angle, saying the project is only economic. India, however, has always opposed CPEC, pointing out that it passes through Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir and affects India’s sovereignty and security.Earlier this year in the Rajya Sabha, minister of state for external affairs Kirti Vardhan Singh repeated India’s stance. In a written reply, he said: “Government's position on CPEC is clear and consistent. Government has consistently protested to parties concerned over the inclusion of the so-called 'China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)', which passes through parts of the Indian Union Territories of Ladakh and Jammu & Kashmir under illegal occupation of Pakistan, as a flagship project of 'OBOR/BRI' and asked them to cease these activities. Any proposed participation of third countries or expansion of the so-called CPEC projects to third countries is unacceptable.”Mir Yar Baloch also praised India’s recent counterterror military actions, highlighting Operation Sindoor, which targeted key terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir after the Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 people.“We commend the bold and resolute actions undertaken by the Modi Government in the previous year through Operation Sindoor, particularly targeting terrorism hubs facilitated by Pakistan and directed against the Pakistani military in response to Pahalgam terror attack. These measures demonstrate exemplary courage and a steadfast commitment to regional security and justice,” he wrote.There has been no official response so far from the Union government, or from Chinese or Pakistani authorities, to Mir Yar Baloch’s claims.",Baloch leader Mir Yar Baloch has raised a “serious threat” warning over deepening China–Pakistan ties.

Why the annual exchange matters



Historical context



Limits of the agreement







NEW DELHI: India and Pakistan on Thursday exchanged, through diplomatic channels, the list of nuclear installations and facilities covered under the Agreement on the Prohibition of Attack against Nuclear Installations and Facilities, the ministry of external affairs said.The exchange took place simultaneously in New Delhi and Islamabad, in keeping with the provisions of the bilateral agreement that governs the protection of nuclear infrastructure in both countries.According to the MEA, the agreement requires India and Pakistan to inform each other of the nuclear installations and facilities covered under the pact on 1 January of every calendar year. Thursday’s exchange marked the 35th consecutive exchange of such lists, with the first taking place on 1 January 1992.The annual exchange has continued uninterrupted for over three decades, even during periods of heightened political and military tension between the two neighbours.The Agreement on the Prohibition of Attack against Nuclear Installations and Facilities was signed on 31 December 1988 and entered into force on 27 January 1991, following the exchange of instruments of ratification by both sides.Under the agreement, both India and Pakistan commit themselves to refrain from undertaking, encouraging or participating in any action aimed at causing destruction of, or damage to, nuclear installations or facilities in the other country.The scope of the agreement is broad. Nuclear installations and facilities covered under the pact include nuclear power plants, research reactors, fuel fabrication units, uranium enrichment facilities, isotope separation plants, reprocessing units and sites storing significant quantities of radioactive material, whether fresh or irradiated.The agreement also specifies that both countries must exchange information on the locations of these facilities, typically in the form of latitude and longitude coordinates, once every year.The annual exchange of lists is designed to reduce the risk of accidental, miscalculated or deliberate attacks on sensitive nuclear infrastructure during periods of conflict or crisis.By formally identifying protected sites, the agreement seeks to prevent scenarios in which conventional military operations could inadvertently escalate into a nuclear crisis. An attack on a nuclear installation, even with conventional weapons, could have catastrophic humanitarian, environmental and strategic consequences.Security analysts view the exchange as a confidence-building measure that helps maintain a minimum level of predictability between two nuclear-armed neighbours with a long history of conflict.Notably, the exchange has continued even during times of strained relations, including after major crises such as the Kargil conflict, the 2001–02 military standoff, the 2016 Uri attack and the 2019 Pulwama attack and Balakot air strikes.When the agreement was negotiated in the late 1980s, both India and Pakistan were moving steadily towards overt nuclear capability, though neither had yet conducted nuclear tests. Concerns over pre-emptive strikes on nuclear facilities, particularly in the context of regional instability, were central to the discussions.The agreement was one of the earliest formal nuclear confidence-building measures between the two countries and predated their 1998 nuclear tests, after which both openly declared themselves nuclear weapon states.Since entering into force in 1991, the agreement has remained intact despite the absence of progress on broader nuclear arms control or risk-reduction mechanisms in South Asia.While the pact prohibits attacks on nuclear installations and facilities, it does not restrict the development, deployment or use of nuclear weapons themselves. Nor does it include verification mechanisms beyond the annual exchange of lists.The agreement also does not cover missile bases, command and control centres or other strategic military assets linked to nuclear weapons.Even so, diplomats and experts argue that the continued observance of the agreement reflects a shared recognition of the dangers posed by attacks on nuclear infrastructure.More than three decades after it came into force, the agreement remains one of the few enduring pillars of nuclear risk reduction between India and Pakistan.In an environment marked by limited dialogue and recurring tensions, the uninterrupted annual exchange of nuclear installation lists serves as a reminder that both sides continue to acknowledge the need to prevent catastrophic escalation.For now, the routine exchange remains a rare example of sustained institutional cooperation between the two countries in the nuclear domain.","India and Pakistan exchange list of nuclear installations and facilities covered under the Agreement on the Prohibition of Attack against Nuclear Installations and Facilities.

ISLAMABAD: Traders across Pakistan have threatened a nationwide shutdown on January 16 if the government does not withdraw its decision to make the installation of Point of Sale (POS) machines mandatory, warning that the move would further burden small businesses and open new avenues for harassment by tax officials, as reported by Dawn.According to Dawn, the warning came during a protest rally held in Islamabad, where traders attempted to march from Aabpara Chowk towards the Red Zone to demonstrate against the Federal Board of Revenue's (FBR) directive.However, heavy police deployment stopped the procession near the Serena Hotel, forcing demonstrators to hold a sit-in at the spot.The protest was organised by the All Pakistan Anjuman-i-Tajran in collaboration with the Traders Action Committee and drew participation from shopkeepers and market representatives from Islamabad and Rawalpindi.Leaders of various trader bodies addressed the gathering, accusing the government of targeting small businesses instead of addressing large-scale corruption.Addressing the crowd, Ajmal Baloch, president of the Traders Action Committee in Islamabad, described the compulsory installation of POS machines as a ""black law"" designed to intimidate traders rather than reform the tax system.He claimed that under the guise of documentation, traders would be exposed to greater harassment and bribery demands by tax officials.Citing an International Monetary Fund assessment, Baloch alleged that corruption in Pakistan amounts to nearly PKR 53 trillion annually, with the FBR accounting for a major share.He accused the department of selectively targeting small shopkeepers while ignoring large-scale corruption.He also alleged that many FBR officials own assets beyond their known sources of income and that their families enjoy foreign education and luxurious lifestyles.The protest leaders also highlighted alleged irregularities in customs operations, claiming that consignments of legally imported goods had been seized and partially returned, while the rest allegedly disappeared, as highlighted by Dawn.Warning of tougher action ahead, the traders announced that if the government attempted to forcibly install POS machines or seal shops, they would block a major arterial road in Islamabad and stage a sit-in at Zero Point on January 16.They further threatened a countrywide shutdown strike if their demands were ignored.The protesters appealed to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to intervene and protect traders from what they described as arbitrary and heavy-handed actions by tax authorities, as reported by Dawn.","Traders across Pakistan have threatened a nationwide shutdown on January 16 if the government does not withdraw its decision to make the installation of Point of Sale (POS) machines mandatory.

However, Ghiskori said that the UAE president did not attend the wedding.Pakistan’s security and foreign policy under Munir remains critical.

Pakistan's former spy chief Faiz Hameed challenged his conviction by a military court which had sentenced him to 14 years in jail, media reports said on Monday.Hameed, the former chief of the powerful Inter-Services Intelligence, was convicted on December 11 by a Field General Court Martial (FGCM) on four counts - engaging in political activities, violating the Official Secrets Act, misusing authority and government resources, and causing wrongful loss to individuals.Hameed's lawyer Mian Ali Ashfaq confirmed that the appeal was filed two days ago, The Express Tribune newspaper reported.A separate application has also been submitted to the Court of Appeal's registrar at General Headquarters Pakistan Army, seeking a copy of the written decision, it said.""The appeal has already been filed,"" Ashfaq said, without disclosing the specific grounds raised in the challenge.Hameed was allowed to appeal against the sentence within 40 days, as given under Section 133-B of the Pakistan Army Act.The appeal will be heard by a Court of Appeals headed by a major general or a senior officer nominated by the army chief, who may uphold, modify or set aside the sentence.Hameed is being held at Special Prison Rawalpindi and has not been shifted to Adiala Jail, the report said.His conviction stems from a 2017 complaint filed by a property developer, who alleged that Hameed, then serving as a major general in the ISI, along with two other officers, raided his residence and business premises, confiscated valuables, and forced him to pay Rs 40 million while also funding a private television channel.The matter resurfaced in 2023 when the Supreme Court directed the property developer to approach the defence ministry, which subsequently instituted a Court of Inquiry in April 2024 to probe the allegations, leading to Hameed's arrest on August 12 that year.The FGCM proceedings commenced on August 12, 2024, and continued for around 15 months before the verdict was announced.Hameed retired from military service in November 2022, became the first former ISI director general to be tried by a military court and convicted.

Pakistan FM Ishaq Dar Admits India Hit Nur Khan Air Base In Operation Sindoor Strikes





Pakistan has once again found itself on the defensive after a senior government official publicly acknowledged the impact of India’s precision strikes on a key military installation during the escalation in May, following Operation Sindoor The admission came from Pakistan’s foreign minister and deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, who, during a year-end press briefing on Saturday, confirmed that India had targeted the Nur Khan Air Base in Rawalpindi’s Chaklala area. Dar acknowledged that the strike caused damage to the military installation and injured personnel stationed there.Addressing reporters, Dar said India had launched multiple drone incursions into Pakistani territory within a short span, underlining the scale of the operation. “They (India) send drones towards Pakistan. In 36 hours, at least 80 drones were sent... We were able to intercept 79 drones out of 80, and only one drone damaged a military installation and personnel were also injured in the attack,” he claimed, according to news agency ANI.Also Read: 'Was advised to take shelter in bunker': Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari's big Op Sindoor admission - watch The foreign minister went on to describe the sequence of events following the strikes, saying that Pakistan’s civil and military leadership, led by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, held an emergency meeting on the night of May 9 to respond to the evolving situation.He added that India “made the mistake” of attacking the Nur Khan Air Base in the early hours of May 10, a remark that further acknowledged the strike and its impact.Dar’s comments amount to a rare public admission by a top Pakistani official of India’s military action on Pakistani air bases in May. The strikes came after Operation Sindoor, launched by the Indian Armed Forces to target nine terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir, in retaliation for the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam that killed 26 civilians.The Pakistan Air Force’s Nur Khan Air Base in Chaklala suffered significant damage during the Indian precision strikes. India had launched Operation Sindoor in the early hours of May 7 as a direct response to the Pahalgam attack.The escalation that followed saw increased cross-border shelling by Pakistan and retaliatory action by Indian forces. The situation later took an unexpected turn when Pakistan’s Director General of Military Operations contacted his Indian counterpart to propose a ceasefire, which India accepted. The outreach from the Pakistani side was later confirmed by Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri, who said both sides agreed to halt all military operations on land, at sea and in the air.Satellite imagery released by Maxar Technologies on May 13 showed significant damage to multiple Pakistani air bases, including Nur Khan Air Base. The images revealed damage at four installations: Nur Khan Air Base in Rawalpindi, PAF Base Mushaf in Sargodha, Bholari Air Base and PAF Base Shahbaz in Jacobabad. A comparison of satellite images taken on April 25 and May 10 showed clear damage to air base facilities, corroborating the strikes.This is not the first time a senior Pakistani leader has acknowledged the attack on Nur Khan Air Base. In May, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif admitted that Indian ballistic missiles had hit the base and other locations, breaking from Pakistan’s usual practice of denying Indian military action.Addressing a ceremony at the Pakistan Monument on May 16, Sharif said, “At around 2:30 am on May 10, General Syed Asim Munir called me on a secure line and informed me that India's ballistic missiles had hit Nur Khan Airbase and other areas.

‘Advised Me To Hide In Bunker’: Pak President Zardari On Op Sindoor, Responds To PM Modi's Warning

Operation Sindoor

(With ANI inputs)





NEW DELHI: Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari admitted that he was urged to take shelter in a bunker for his safety during the four-day confrontation with India in May, a remark that underscored India’s prowess to strike deep into mainland Pakistan.According to Zardari, the advice came from his military secretary, though he claimed he refused to take shelter.“I had actually told him (secretary) four days earlier that a war was going to happen. But he came to me and said, ‘Sir, let’s go to the bunkers.’ I replied, ‘If martyrdom is to come, it will come here. Leaders don’t die in bunkers; they die on the battlefield. They don’t die sitting in bunkers,’” Zardari said on Saturday at a rally marking the death anniversary of his wife and former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, who was assassinated in 2007.He added that every worker of his Pakistan Peoples Party was ready to sacrifice his life for the nation.Zardari also responded to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “roti khao, varna meri goli toh hai hi” (eat your food peacefully, or else my bullet is waiting for you) warning to Pakistan, saying that it would be Pakistan that would fire the bullets.He further remarked that India may have an economy 10 times larger than Pakistan’s, but questioned where it would find the “courage” to fight a war.Indian armed forces launched Operation Sindoor on the intervening night of May 6–7 in retaliation for the Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 civilians. The strikes targeted nine terror facilities in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.Pakistan responded to the operation, triggering further retaliation by Indian forces, which subsequently struck around a dozen Pakistani air force bases.On May 10, Pakistan’s Director General of Military Operations contacted his Indian counterpart seeking a ceasefire, which was accepted.India has consistently maintained that Operation Sindoor has only been “halted” and would be resumed in the future if required.","Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari admitted that he was urged to take shelter in a bunker for his safety during the four-day confrontation with India in May.

Trump Puts Asim Munir On Gaza Test: Can Pak Army Chief Appease U.S & Avoid Backlash At Home?

Former Imran Khan aide Shahzad Akbar attacked in UK





Pakistan on Friday summoned Britain’s deputy high commissioner Matt Cannell after a video circulated online showing a woman at a rally in the UK referring to a possible attack on Pakistan Army chief General Asim Munir The ministry of foreign affairs called in Cannell to lodge a formal protest and demanded an investigation after the woman, speaking at a rally in Bradford in northern England, mentioned the possibility of the army chief being killed in a car bombing. Pakistani officials said the remarks went beyond political expression and raised serious security concerns.The rally was held in support of Pakistan’s jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan and was attended by his supporters living in the UK. Khan was removed from office through a no-confidence vote in April 2022 and has been in prison for nearly two years.The Bradford protest came days after a special court of Pakistan’s Federal Investigation Agency sentenced Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, to 17 years in prison each in the Toshakhana-II corruption case.According to Dawn, the court also imposed a fine of Pakistani Rs 16.4 million on each of them, with additional jail time possible in case of non-payment. The case relates to the alleged illegal retention and sale of state gifts received while Khan was in office.The video from the Bradford rally was initially shared on X by the UK chapter of Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party before being deleted.Explaining the decision, PTI UK said in a post on X: “We have removed a video from the recent Bradford protest featuring a citizen’s metaphorical remarks regarding General Asim Munir. Although we do not believe the individual incited violence, the post was deleted in an abundance of caution to prevent potential misunderstanding and legal safeguarding of the individual and her rights.”Pakistan’s deputy interior minister Talal Chaudhry said the remarks crossed a red line. Speaking to Geo Television, he said: “While Imran Khan’s party has been inciting supporters against the military, the car bomb threat at the Bradford rally crossed all limits. It does not fall into the category of freedom of speech.”He urged the UK government to investigate the incident and take legal action if laws were violated.Responding to Pakistan’s concerns, the UK High Commission in Islamabad said in a brief statement: “Where a foreign Government believes a crime has been committed, they should provide all relevant material to their UK police liaison. Any material that appears to break UK law will be reviewed by the police and may lead to a criminal investigation.”The diplomatic move comes amid escalating tensions between Khan’s supporters and Pakistan’s powerful military. Earlier this month, army spokesperson Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry described Khan as “mentally ill” during a press conference, after posts on Khan’s official X account referred to General Munir as “mentally unstable,” according to the Associated Press.Separately, tensions escalated further after PTI said Shahzad Akbar, a former adviser to Imran Khan was attacked in the United Kingdom on Thursday.In a post on X, Akbar said he was assaulted outside his home in Cambridge by an unidentified man.“Yesterday at approximately 8:08 a.m., I was attacked at my home by an unknown assailant dressed in what appeared to be construction or waste-collection attire,” Akbar wrote. “The individual asked, ‘Are you Shahzad Akbar?’ and immediately began assaulting me. The incident occurred in the presence of my family.”Akbar said he sustained facial injuries, including bruising and a fractured nose, and was taken to a local hospital before being discharged.“The police have taken cognizance of the matter and have assured me and my family that they are actively investigating this targeted attack and will work to apprehend both the perpetrator and those behind it,” he said.He added that he could not share further details at this stage, including CCTV footage, on the advice of authorities.“I have full faith in the rule of law and in British law enforcement to carry out their duties,” Akbar said, urging the UK government to ensure the safety of dissidents.In a follow-up statement, Akbar said the attack would not silence him.“I want to make one thing absolutely clear: If my views, political comments, or even my ‘face’ is not liked by anyone, such cowardly acts will only strengthen my resolve rather than silence me,” he wrote. “Violence will not intimidate me or deter me from speaking out.”The Pakistan government has previously submitted extradition documents to British authorities seeking Akbar’s return.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan’s nuclear proliferation programme triggered deep concern at the highest levels of the United States and Russia, with both countries expressing that Islamabad’s nuclear activities made them “nervous”, according to newly declassified documents released by the US National Security Archive.The documents, made public this week following a Freedom of Information lawsuit, include verbatim transcripts of meetings and phone calls between former US president George W Bush and Russian president Vladimir Putin between 2001 and 2008. They reveal repeated discussions on Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal, links to Iran’s nuclear programme, and the role of the AQ Khan proliferation network.In a key Oval Office meeting in 2005, Putin raised concerns over evidence suggesting Pakistani-origin uranium had been found in Iranian centrifuges, questioning Western tolerance of Islamabad despite its proliferation record.“But it's not clear what the labs (Iran) have, where they are. Cooperation with Pakistan still exists,” Putin said during the meeting.Bush responded by referring to his discussions with then Pakistani president Pervez Musharraf, saying, “I talked to Musharraf about that. I told him we're worried about transfers to Iran and North Korea. They put AQ Khan in jail, and some of his buddies under house arrest. We want to know what they said.I keep reminding Musharraf of that. Either he's getting nothing, or he's not being forthcoming.”Putin reiterated his concerns, stating, “As far as I understand, they found uranium of Pakistani origin in the centrifuges.”Bush acknowledged the issue, saying, “Yes, the stuff the Iranians forgot to tell the IAEA about. That's a violation.”“It was of Pakistani origin. That makes me nervous,” Putin said, to which Bush replied, “It makes us nervous, too.”Also read: 'I want Pak': Rajnath recalls Vajpayee's unmatched wit; all about iconic moment The documents also highlight Putin’s blunt assessment of Pakistan during an earlier meeting with Bush in Slovenia in 2001. “I am concerned about Pakistan. It is just a junta with nuclear weapons. It is no democracy, yet the West makes no criticism of it. Should talk about it,” Putin said.According to the transcripts, both leaders expressed anxiety about Pakistan’s internal political instability, its military-led governance under Musharraf, and the risk that sensitive nuclear technology could fall into the wrong hands. The discussions repeatedly returned to the AQ Khan network, which was later confirmed to have supplied nuclear technology to Iran, North Korea, and Libya.The declassified records underscore longstanding international concerns about Pakistan’s nuclear command and control systems and the broader implications of its proliferation activities.The revelations come amid renewed scrutiny of Pakistan’s nuclear conduct. Last month, India criticised Islamabad following remarks by US President Donald Trump alleging that Pakistan had been secretly testing nuclear weapons.Reacting to Trump’s comments, Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said such actions were consistent with Pakistan’s history. “Clandestine and illegal nuclear activities are in keeping with Pakistan's history, which is centred around decades of smuggling, export control violations, secret partnerships, AQ Khan network and further proliferation,” he said.“India has always drawn the attention of the international community to these aspects of Pakistan's record,” Jaiswal added."," transcripts of meetings and phone calls between former US president George W Bush and Russian president Vladimir Putin released by US National Security Archive.

Pak PM Sharif's Party Leader Threatens India, Warns Missiles Will Respond If Bangladesh Is Targeted





In a sharp attack on Pakistan’s security establishment, Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman accused the military leadership of employing a “double standard” regarding cross-border military operations. Speaking at a recent gathering in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the influential Deobandi cleric questioned the logical consistency of Pakistan’s defence policy, specifically contrasting Islamabad’s recent strikes in Afghanistan with its diplomatic outrage over Indian activities within Pakistani borders.He asked Pakistan’s military brass why India’s actions inside Pakistan should be condemned when Islamabad justifies strikes in Afghanistan by calling them attacks on its enemies. Rehman argued that if Pakistan claimed a sovereign right to launch pre-emptive or retaliatory strikes against perceived enemies on Afghan soil, it weakened its moral and legal standing when protesting similar actions by India. “We sent militants to Afghanistan for 20 years. .. from giving them Kalashnikovs to Cruise missiles... we empowered them in every way. When you bombed Kabul, it was as if someone had bombed your Islamabad.This is the limit, isn’t it? If you had bombed the remote areas, you might have been able to tolerate it. So, you took some action there as well...”“...If you say, and I have questions, that we have attacked the enemy’s headquarters and you call this a legitimate statement, India says to you that it has attacked Bahawalpur, it has attacked Muridke, it has attacked the headquarters of those who are operating against us in Kashmir. Why are you objecting to this? And if you object to this, and if you have the same claims against Afghanistan, how will you justify it..?”Rehman’s criticism comes at a time when Pakistan’s Field Marshal Asim Munir continues his anti-India rhetoric and claims that Pakistan received “divine help” during the military confrontation with India in May which was felt during the days of intense fighting that followed Indian strikes on terror targets.Rehman’s comments touch upon a sensitive nerve in geopolitics, specifically referring to locations like Bahawalpur and Muridke — areas long identified as hubs for terrorist groups like JeM and LeT — which were decimated during Operation Sindoor. By asking, “Why different rules for India?” Rehman highlighted the strategic hypocrisy: justification of “counterterrorism strikes” in the west, while demanding absolute territorial sanctity in the east.",Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman accused the military leadership of employing a “double standard” regarding cross-border military operations.

Hindu Businessman Khokon Das, Hacked And Set Ablaze By Mob in Bangladesh, Dies 3 Days After Attack





Bangladesh’s elite security force, the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), on Sunday arrested three people in connection with the brutal murder of Hindu businessman Khokon Das in Shariatpur.The Chief Adviser’s Press Wing said the arrests were made following an overnight operation carried out by RAB teams in Kishoreganj. The accused, identified as Sohag, Rabbi and Palash, were detained around 1 am from the Bajitpur area. RAB said the operation was led by ASP Shahjahan of RAB-14’s CPC-2 unit, according to news agency ANI.According to police, Khokon Das, 50, was a pharmacy owner and a bKash mobile banking agent in Keherbhanga Bazaar. On the night of December 31, he was returning home after closing his shop when he was attacked near the Tilai area, close to his residence.Shariatpur Superintendent of Police Rawnak Jahan said Das was assaulted by three to four attackers armed with sharp weapons. He sustained multiple injuries and the assailants also robbed him of the cash he was carrying.Jahan further said that before his death, Das had mentioned the names of the accused.Later, after realising that he had recognised some of them, the attackers poured petrol on his body and face and set him on fire in an attempt to kill him.Hearing his screams, local residents rushed to the spot, forcing the attackers to flee. Das was rescued in a critical condition and taken to Shariatpur Sadar Hospital. As his condition worsened, he was referred to Dhaka Medical College Hospital and later to the National Burn Institute, where he died during treatment.Police said the arrested men are known in the area for criminal activities and alleged drug abuse. Further investigation is under way.Khokon Das’s nephew-in-law, Pranto Das, said the family is seeking a thorough investigation and justice. He further stressed that no one involved in the killing should be spared and that all those responsible must be held accountable.The killing has sparked concern amid reports of recent violent incidents involving members of the Hindu community in Bangladesh. Rights groups and community leaders have called for strict action against perpetrators and stronger measures to ensure the safety of minorities.Last month, Dipu Chandra Das, a local garment factory worker was beaten to death by a mob and his body was set on fire in Bangladesh’s Mymensingh district.","Bangladesh’s elite security force, the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), on Sunday arrested three people in connection with the brutal murder of Hindu businessman Khokon Das.

Inqilab Moncho To March Nationwide Seeking Justice For Sharif Osman Hadi





DHAKA: In a sensational somersault, and days after further straining already tense India-Bangladesh ties by claiming that youth leader Sharif Osman Hadi ’s alleged killers had crossed into India, Dhaka on Saturday said it cannot confirm the whereabouts of the suspects.“We cannot say with 100% certainty where the suspects are, but they (authorities) remain in touch with India,” foreign affairs adviser Md Touhid Hossain said putting in question Dhaka Metropolitan Police additional commissioner (crime and operations) S N Md Nazrul Islam’s Dec 28 statement asserting “the two primary suspects of the murder — Faisal Karim Masud and Alamgir Sheikh — crossed into the Indian state of Meghalaya with the help of local associates”.“At least the home ministry has not yet confirmed to me that the individuals involved are staying at any specific location. We have received some indications from interrogation that they may have crossed the border. If we can identify a very specific location, then we can inform India that the suspects are in a particular place so that they can be arrested and handed over to us,” Hossain told reporters in Munshiganj. He said, “This is how communication with India is being maintained.Let’s see how much progress we can make in this regard.”Matters went against Dhaka on Wednesday after a video surfaced online in which, Masud denied the charge pinned on him by the Muhammad Yunus-led interim govt while also refuting its assertion that he slipped into India after committing the alleged crime and is holed up in the country.“Because of this false implication, I was forced to leave the country (Bangladesh) and come to Dubai. I came here with great difficulty, even though I held a valid five-year multiple-entry Dubai visa,” he had said.Nazrul Islam’s comments had not only put further pressure on New-Delhi-Dhaka relations — which worsened after large-scale anti-India protests and mob violence in Bangladesh following Islamic radical leader Osman’s death on Dec 18, six days after being shot in the head in Dhaka — but also sought to give new life to conspiracy theories that India had a role in the killing.The conspiracies had died down after Osman’s brother Omar, in a sensational twist, accused a section within Yunus-led govt of orchestrating the killing to derail the Feb 12 national election and cautioned of a Sheikh Hasina-like fate if Osman’s attackers are not tried quickly.Hossain also said there is no scope for rushing the trial in Osman’s murder case. “Trial is a matter where there is no room for haste,” he said, amid Osman’s party Inqilab Moncho’s 30-day ultimatum — which began a day after his death — to try his killers. “Decision has already been made to issue a chargesheet. The charge sheet is the initial step of the judicial process, which falls under the responsibility of the police, and the police will do it,” he said.",Dhaka on Saturday said it cannot confirm the whereabouts of the suspects.

Heavy rainfall in Beijing has resulted in at least 30 fatalities, Chinese officials confirmed on Tuesday, as severe storms caused floods and landslides across northern China.By midnight, Miyun, a mountainous area in northeastern Beijing, received over 21 inches of rainfall, with 28 deaths recorded there, according to state broadcaster CCTV, quoted by NYT . The city-wide average rainfall exceeded 6 inches.Yanqing district in northwestern Beijing reported two additional deaths. The rainfall began on Saturday, though the timing of the fatalities remained unspecified. ""Continuous heavy rainfall caused major disasters,"" CCTV reported on Tuesday as rain continued to fall.The broadcaster revealed that over 80,000 Beijing residents have been evacuated. Numerous roads sustained damage, whilst 136 villages within Beijing's administrative region, predominantly rural areas, experienced power outages.Beijing, on Monday night, issued its highest flood alert, advising residents to remain indoors unless essential. Authorities ordered the closure of schools and construction sites.Prior to the casualty announcement on Monday evening, state media reported that Xi Jinping , China's leader, instructed officials to prioritise flood prevention and rescue operations. According to Xinhua news agency, he noted that China was ""currently in the critical period of flood prevention from July to August.""He acknowledged significant casualties and property damage across northern and eastern China in recent days.Other northern Chinese regions reported rain-related deaths, including Shanxi province, where a bus disappeared on Sunday. In Jinan, Shandong province, at least two people perished last week after receiving half a year's typical rainfall within five hours.Beijing experienced its heaviest rainfall in 140 years during 2023. However, neighbouring Hebei province bore the brunt of the damage after officials opened floodgates to ""build a 'moat' for the capital."" This decision sparked outrage among Hebei residents who claimed insufficient warning.In 2012, devastating floods in Beijing and Hebei claimed 145 lives.","Heavy rainfall in Beijing has resulted in at least 30 fatalities, Chinese officials confirmed on Tuesday.

US vice president JD Vance praised Donald Trump for securing a major trade agreement with the European Union, saying European media outlets are applauding the deal.“The entire European press is singing the president’s praises right now, amazed at the deal he negotiated on behalf of Americans,” Vance said wrote on Sunday (local time) on social media platform X.However, he also drew a satire at American media houses, saying, “Tomorrow the American media will undoubtedly run headlines like ‘Donald Trump Only Got 99.9 Percent of What He Asked For’.”The remarks came after President Trump announced that the United States and the European Union had “reached a deal” on trade, calling it “a good deal for everybody.”Under the agreement, the US will impose a 15% tariff on products imported from the EU, a move aimed at averting a deeper trade rift. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen also described the outcome as “a good deal”, according to AFP.Speaking to reporters in Scotland, where the talks were held at Trump’s Turnberry golf resort, the president revealed that the EU has committed to $600 billion in new investments in the US, along with $750 billion in energy purchases.“It was a very interesting negotiation. I think it's going to be great for both parties,” he said.Meanwhile, vice president Vance would be heading to his home state of Ohio on Monday to continue promoting the GOP’s major tax-and-border legislation.He’s scheduled to visit a steel plant in Canton, about 60 miles south of Cleveland, where he’ll highlight the bill’s “benefits for hardworking American families and businesses,” according to his office. While few details have been shared ahead of the visit, NBC News reports that his remarks will centre on how the bill supports local industry.This will be Vance’s second trip this month to pitch the legislation, which combines several conservative priorities and has been branded by Republicans as the “One Big, Beautiful Bill.” As its lead spokesperson on the road, Vance has taken a front seat in selling the plan to the public.Earlier in West Pittston, Pennsylvania, he told workers at an industrial machine shop that the bill lets people keep more of what they earn, pointing to new tax deductions on overtime as a key example.","US vice president JD Vance praised Donald Trump for securing a major trade agreement with the European Union.

A stabbing attack at a Walmart store in Traverse City, Michigan, left 11 people injured on Sunday.

One man stands out, pointing a gun directly at the suspect, keeping him frozen in place until police arrived. That man is Perry.While authorities haven’t officially named him, Perry’s family and locals have identified him in Facebook posts, calling him a true hero. One post read, “This is Derrick Perry!

"Operation Grayskull: US justice department shuts child abuse sites; had 120,000 users and millions of files",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/operation-grayskull-us-justice-department-shuts-child-abuse-sites-had-120000-users-and-millions-of-files/articleshow/122944047.cms,"On Cam: Israeli Navy STORMS Gaza Aid Ship; Activists Claim 'Hijack' Off Ashdod Coast





US federal authorities have taken down a massive dark web network trading child sexual abuse material, in what the justice department described as “one of the most successful” operations of its kind.The move has resulted in the conviction of at least 18 individuals across the United States.The man at the centre of the investigation, William Spearman, known online as “Boss,” was arrested in November 2022 during a high-risk raid on his home in Madison, Alabama.The search warrant for his arrest was deemed so critical it received direct approval from the FBI director himself. Agents breached his home using tactical explosives, and despite Spearman fighting back, with three handguns within arm’s reach, he was subdued and arrested.His capture marked a pivotal moment in Operation Grayskull, a years-long investigation that uncovered four of the most heavily trafficked child exploitation websites on the dark web. The FBI said these platforms were responsible for hosting and distributing hundreds of thousands of sexually exploitative images of children, with a million files, having over 120,000 members and recording upwards of 100,000 visits in a single day.“This is one of the most successful of all time,” said Matthew Galeotti, head of the justice department’s criminal division.“We dismantled four websites that have not regenerated.”Spearman pleaded guilty a year after his arrest and has since been sentenced to life imprisonment. Prosecutors described him as “one of the most significant” distributors of child sex abuse material globally.A sentencing memo noted that his refusal to surrender peacefully stemmed from the troves of incriminating evidence on his devices. “The devices at his desk contained massive quantities of evidence proving that he was the lead administrator of Website A,” the memo cited by CBS News said.“Unsurprisingly, the defendant's devices also contained an enormous collection of images and videos depicting the rape and abuse of children.”The investigation began in 2020 after authorities observed an alarming increase in traffic to a suspected dark web child abuse site. That discovery quickly led to a broader international operation, exposing a deeply embedded and technologically advanced network of abusers.“These are people who have a more of a technical understanding,” Galeotti said. “The defendants in this case, as sadistic as they may be, are somewhat sophisticated,” noting the use of encryption and other evasive tools.Among those convicted was Selwyn Rosenstein, who in 2022 was sentenced to 28 years in prison. His platform, prosecutors said, “was not simply a website; it was a large, active community of pedophiles and (abuse material) enthusiasts. And it existed in part because of the Defendant's criminal acts.”Rosenstein stored so many illicit images that he needed to keep some on servers tied to his business operations.Another key figure, Matthew Garrell from Raleigh, North Carolina, was jailed for 20 years. Prosecutors revealed that Garrell had built an “extremely complex and technologically sophisticated conspiracy,” complete with a predator’s “handbook” containing detailed child grooming instructions.Members of these dark web communities were often required to contribute abusive content, pay membership fees, or assist with site moderation to gain access. “They were part of an online community of hundreds of thousands of people, with leadership roles, rules and a common dedicated purpose,” said Chris Delzotto, acting FBI deputy assistant director.“Few people would have envisioned how (child abuse materials) would permeate the internet, the way it has today,” he added.The FBI has confirmed that the same leadership team operated several of the shuttered sites. Abbigail Beccaccio, an FBI unit chief, said, “The leadership team that operated one of the sites also operated several of the others.”The scope of Operation Grayskull extended nationwide, with convicted individuals hailing from Virginia, Maryland, Indiana, Texas, Washington, Arkansas, Michigan, and Oklahoma. The Department of Justice is hailing the takedown as a major victory in its ongoing fight against online child exploitation.“Even for prosecutors, it is difficult to understand how pervasive this is,” Galeotti said. “Because it happens on the dark web, people aren’t aware of it. It’s extremely troubling.”","US federal authorities have taken down a massive dark web network trading child sexual abuse material.

'Murderers, Rapists Welcomed': Trump Ally Ted Cruz Torches Dems, Biden Over 'Criminal Aliens'





Former President Joe Biden has secured a deal with Little, Brown & Co. to pen a memoir about his White House tenure. Industry executives revealed that the untitled book, acquired through an auction by the Hachette imprint, garnered a £10 million advance, as initially reported by The Wall Street Journal.President Biden hinted that his memoir will cover his four years as President, according to NY Post.Diagnosed with aggressive prostate cancer in May, the 82-year-old Biden has discussed the project at various public gatherings, expressing urgency to complete it amidst his health challenges. At a San Diego event, he stated that he was ""working like hell with a publisher"" to research and expedite a memoir focusing on his presidential period.While former presidents traditionally publish accounts of their time in office, Biden's memoir offers an opportunity to address concerns about his physical and mental capabilities, alongside presenting his presidential narrative.At an event earlier this month, Biden said that he was “working my tail off” to write a memoir. He was represented by Creative Artists Agency, which sold the worldwide rights for the book to Hachette.The agency also represented Biden for his 2017 memoir “Promise Me, Dad: A Year of Hope, Hardship and Purpose,” which chronicled his final year with his eldest son, Beau, who died from brain cancer in 2015.Having achieved his long-held presidential ambition, Biden became the oldest incumbent upon his January 2020 inauguration. He later withdrew from the 2024 electoral race amid growing concerns about his capacity to serve.Subsequently, discussions have centred on whether his close associates and party overlooked his apparent decline.Also read: Hillary Clinton flagged concerns on Biden's 'viability' before re-election bid; ex-NSA Jake Sullivan also approached Ron Klain Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson's ""Original Sin"", a significant non-fiction release this year, examines how Biden's protective inner circle disregarded his fragility, potentially compromising Democratic electoral prospects. The book achieved considerable success, with nearly 100,000 print copies sold according to Circana BookScan. Conservative publishers have responded with publications focusing on controversies surrounding his son Hunter.Presidential memoirs typically command eight-figure advances, valued for prestige as much as sales potential. Biden's memoir, however, is considerably valued lower than his peers. Barack and Michelle Obama notably secured approximately £60 million from Penguin Random House in 2017.Both Obama books achieved remarkable success: ""A Promised Land"" exceeded 2.8 million hardcover sales, while ""Becoming"" surpassed 5 million print copies, per Circana BookScan. Bill Clinton's 2004 ""My Life"" and George W. Bush's ""Decision Points"" also achieved significant commercial success with substantial advances.However, the political non-fiction market has evolved, becoming increasingly divided. Recent publications analysing the 2024 election have struggled to attract broad readership.Biden's 2017 publication ""Promise Me, Dad"", chronicling his son Beau's death from brain cancer, balanced political content with personal loss and achieved bestseller status. Other Biden family members, including his sister Valerie Biden Owens and son Hunter, have published memoirs. Jill Biden authored a 2019 memoir about their family life and several children's books.","Former President Joe Biden has secured a deal with Little, Brown & Co. to pen a memoir about his White House tenure.

US President in Scotland: Did Trump cheat at a golf game? Caddie's video goes viral,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-president-in-scotland-did-trump-cheat-at-a-golf-game-caddies-video-goes-viral/articleshow/122945495.cms,"Big Trump 'Security Breach': Protesters Enter Golf Course Vicinity In Scotland; Cops Did This Next

Poll Should golf etiquette rules be strictly enforced among all players? Yes, every player should follow the rules. No, some flexibility is acceptable.





A video from President Donald Trump’s recent golf trip to Scotland has stirred a social media storm, with fresh accusations of cheating on the course.The footage, filmed during Trump’s visit to his Turnberry resort on 26–27 July 2025, shows a caddie discreetly dropping a ball in the rough. While Trump himself is not seen hitting the shot in question, the clip has gone viral, fuelling debate online about whether the US president once again bent the rules of the game.President Trump, 79, was in Scotland over the weekend, having just announced a major tariffs agreement with the European Union, one of America’s most significant trading partners.But alongside his official duties, he also made time to play 18 holes each day at Trump Turnberry, the golf course he owns and hopes will host a future British Open.The viral video has sparked long-standing claims that Trump routinely cheats at golf, accusations that have been echoed by those who have played with him in the past.So, did the US President actually cheat? Here is what his fellow players have to say.Jack O’Donnell, who worked as vice president at Trump Plaza Casino in Atlantic City, recalled what his late colleague, Mark Eddis, once said about golfing with Trump.“So, does he improve his lie?” O'Donnell asked Eddis, according to sportswriter Rick Reilly.“Every shot but the tee shot,"" Eddis reportedly replied with a laugh as reported by The Spun.Improving one’s lie, moving the ball to a better position, is considered a breach of golf etiquette, even among casual players. While it may happen informally, it’s certainly frowned upon when someone lays claim to multiple club championships, as Trump does.Another former playing partner, Bryan Marsal, a longtime member of Winged Foot Golf Club, shared his own experience with the president.“I played with him once,” Marsal said, as cited by The Spun.“It was a Saturday morning game. We go to the first tee and he couldn’t have been nicer. But then he said, ‘You see those two guys? They cheat. See me? I cheat. And I expect you to cheat because we’re going to beat those two guys today.’… So, yes, it’s true, he’s going to cheat you. But I think Donald, in his heart of hearts, believes that you’re gonna cheat him, too. So if it’s the same, if everybody’s cheating, he doesn’t see it as really cheating. ”Online, the reaction to the video has been predictably split.“And you are surprised? he did that all his life,” wrote one user on social media platform X.“It’s not cheating when you own the course,” one user joked.Some users could also be seen defending the US President, “Why did you stop the video? It doesn’t show him cheating, because it doesn’t show him hitting the ball.”“Every single golfer has done this, multiple times,” argued another.Some have demanded the full uncut version of the video, insisting that the brief clip doesn’t provide conclusive evidence. Others, meanwhile, said that the move is a common one on the golf course and not worth the fuss.","A video from President Donald Trump's recent golf trip to Scotland has stirred a social media storm, with fresh accusations of cheating.

Indian-origin, Democratic Mayoral frontrunner Zohran Mamdani on Monday reacted to the Midtown Manhattan office shooting from Uganda saying he was ""heartbroken"" by the deadly incident.Sharing a post on X Mamdani said, ""I’m heartbroken to learn of the horrific shooting in midtown and I am holding the victims, their families, and the NYPD officer in critical condition in my thoughts. """"Grateful for all of our first responders on the ground,"" he added.Mamdani is currently in Uganda, celebrating his wedding at a heavily guarded private estate in the upscale Buziga Hill area near Kampala.A mass shooting at a Midtown Manhattan office tower on Monday evening left five people dead, including a New York City police officer, and the suspect, with a sixth victim critically injured.The suspected gunman, identified as Shane Tamura from Las Vegas died at the scene from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, according to authorities.Mayor Eric Adams called the attack a ""senseless act of violence"" and said officials are still working to understand the motive. ""We lost four souls to another act of senseless violence,"" Adams said at a late-night briefing, excluding the gunman from the death toll.NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch confirmed Tamura had a ""documented mental health history,"" but no clear motive has been established yet. ""We are working to understand why he targeted this particular location,"" she added.The shooting unfolded at 345 Park Avenue, a prominent high-rise that houses major institutions including Blackstone, the National Football League, and the Irish Consulate.Surveillance footage showed Tamura pulling up in a double-parked black BMW, stepping out with an M-4-style rifle, and walking into the building.According to Tisch, Tamura immediately opened fire at the entrance, shooting a uniformed officer before turning the weapon on others inside.A woman who tried to flee was gunned down, followed by a security guard behind a desk and another man in the lobby.Tamura was armed with a .223-caliber Palmetto State Armory AR-15-style assault rifle. Police later found a revolver, ammunition, and extra magazines in his vehicle.The shooting took place in a busy part of Midtown Manhattan, just north of Grand Central Terminal and close to St. Patrick’s Cathedral.Local television footage showed people evacuating the office building with their hands raised.

US President Donald Trump on Monday claimed credit for brokering peace between Cambodia and Thailand by leveraging trade deals.In an interview, Trump said that his administration began a series of discussions with both countries and “settled” the conflict “within less than a day.”""You know, they've had many conflicts and wars over the years. When I spoke to them, they said, 500 years. They said, that's a lot. But now it was raging, and raging hard. People were being killed at the border a lot. And I said to Thailand—we're doing a trading deal, and I'm not going to do a deal if you're going to be killing each other. And I spoke to Cambodia—said essentially the same thing. I dealt with the two prime ministers,"" Trump said.""But somebody had to implement what I did. And we started a series of discussions—back and forth, back and forth. And within less than a day, we have it settled. And I guess now, based on what you're saying, they've just said we're going to have peace. That's great. Millions of people are going to be saved.

The truce was officially declared in Kuala Lumpur after peace talks mediated by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, the current chair of the ASEAN bloc.Trump had earlier warned both countries that the US would not proceed with trade negotiations if the conflict dragged on.“We happen to be, by coincidence, currently dealing on trade with both countries, but do not want to make any deal… if they are fighting — and I have told them so!” he posted over the weekend.Trump also likened the situation to the past conflict between India and Pakistan, which he claimed to have resolved successfully.“This very much reminds me of the conflict between Pakistan and India, which was brought to a successful halt,” he wrote.Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet publicly thanked Trump for his “decisive support,” calling the peace deal “a foundation for future de-escalation.” The decades-long territorial dispute between the two countries flared up again last week, with both sides trading blame for triggering the latest violence. The disputed region—home to ancient temples and dense forest—has long been a flashpoint.While the ceasefire has brought temporary relief, military commanders from both sides are scheduled to meet on Tuesday to discuss next steps, followed by a cross-border committee meeting on August 4 in Cambodia.",US President Donald Trump claimed credit for brokering peace between Cambodia and Thailand.

Three Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militants were killed in an encounter with Pakistani security forces in Karachi, officials confirmed on Monday.Among those killed was Zafran, who was identified as the mastermind of a November 2024 attack on two Chinese engineers in Pakistan's largest city. He carried a bounty of Rs 20 million.The operation was conducted late Sunday night in the Manghopir area by the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) and intelligence agencies, CTD official Raja Umer Khattab told. The TTP men opened fire when they saw security personnel approaching, triggering a firefight which lasted over an hour.Authorities recovered a suicide jacket, three grenades, a Kalashnikov rifle, two pistols, and a large quantity of ammunition from the site.On November 5 last year, a private security guard opened fire on two Chinese nationals at a textile mill in Karachi, injuring both before fleeing.Pakistan has witnessed a sharp increase in militant attacks—particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan—since the TTP ended its ceasefire with the federal government in late 2022.Founded in 2007, the TTP is an umbrella organisation of various extremist groups seeking to impose a strict version of Islamic law across Pakistan. It has claimed responsibility for numerous high-profile attacks, including the 2008 Marriott Hotel bombing in Islamabad, the 2009 assault on army headquarters, and multiple strikes on security installations.","Three Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militants were killed in an encounter with Pakistani security forces in Karachi.

Pakistan tribal council threatens highway block over girl’s murder,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-tribal-council-threatens-highway-block-over-girls-murder/articleshow/122939897.cms,"



ISLAMABAD: A tribal jirga (council of elders) in Pakistan’s Tank district has threatened to block a stretch of Indus Highway on July 29 after the killing of a nine-year-old girl sparked public outrage. Convened in Tank’s Gul Imam on Saturday, the jirga issued an 11-point charter of demands, warning of a full blockade if authorities fail to respond.Indus Highway (N-55) is a critical national artery that runs along the river, connecting Karachi in Pakistan’s south with Peshawar in the north and cutting through multiple provinces. The planned blockade at Pezu will impact trade routes, passenger transport, and military convoys.The protests gained momentum after a viral video showed residents confronting armed security personnel -- an extraordinary act in this militarised stretch of southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The footage amplified long-standing anger over arbitrary detentions, raids without warrants, and what locals call collective punishment disguised as counterterrorism.“Our decision to block the highway remains. If our demands are accepted, we’ll reconsider.If not, Pezu will be shut down on July 29,” jirga leader Abdul Qayum Kundi said.Police have registered a case in the girl’s death, but authorities have yet to disclose any findings. Locals allege misconduct or negligence by security forces—claims that remain unverified but widely believed within the community.In a bid to defuse tensions, local officials delivered three sheep and (Pak) Rs 2.5 million (around $9,000) to the girl’s family -- an act rooted in tribal custom, meant to symbolise remorse and reconciliation. But jirga members view it as a token gesture. “This is hush money in ceremonial form,” said one elder.The jirga’s demands include the release of detainees not proven to have militant ties, an end to forced house searches, and a halt to arrests of suspects’ relatives. They also call for the return of confiscated weapons and an end to detentions based on vague accusations of mukhbiri (spying).The jirga’s demands echo those of the banned Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement (PTM), which for years challenged Pakistan’s security policies in its tribal belt.","A tribal jirga in Pakistan’s Tank district has threatened to block a stretch of Indus Highway.

‘Reject Pakistani Rule’: BNM Accuses Pakistan of Genocide in Balochistan, Launches Armed Resistance

Poll Do you think that protests and appeals by families of the abducted individuals can lead to change? Yes, they can raise awareness. No, they are largely ineffective.





The crisis of enforced disappearances in Pakistan's Balochistan region and beyond has deepened this week, as a disturbing string of abductions emerges from Karachi, Noshki, and Kech, according to The Balochistan Post (TBP).Among the most alarming cases is that of Muslim Dad Baloch, a fourth-semester philosophy student at the University of Karachi.On Monday evening, he was reportedly abducted near the university's Maskan Gate. Eyewitnesses say he was taken by unidentified men in a vehicle while returning to his hostel with friends.Originally from Mashkay in Awaran district, Muslim Dad was a familiar face within the Baloch student community in Karachi. His sudden disappearance has sparked fear among his peers and left his family devastated.In Noshki, another troubling case unfolded earlier today when Hafeezullah, the son of Peer Mohammad and a resident of Qaziabad, was allegedly picked up from his home by Pakistani security forces. His family has raised alarm over his unknown whereabouts and is demanding his immediate release.TBP also reported two recent disappearances in Kech district.On July 23, 16-year-old shopkeeper Qambar Baloch was allegedly taken by men believed to belong to Military Intelligence and the ISI while he was in Jusak, Turbat. And on June 27, Imran Khan, a 26-year-old student of Balochi language and culture at the University of Turbat, was reportedly abducted by Frontier Corps and Military Intelligence personnel in Turbat city—in broad daylight.“These are not isolated cases. This is a pattern,” said a representative from Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP), a group that has long campaigned for the safe recovery of abducted individuals. Despite repeated appeals and protests, most cases remain unresolved, with no accountability or formal investigations.","Muslim Dad Baloch, a fourth-semester philosophy student at the University of Karachi, was reportedly abducted on Monday.

ISLAMABAD: As jailed former PM Imran Khan completes two years in prison, his sons – Sulaiman and Qasim – have stepped into the political spotlight, launching an aggressive lobbying campaign in the United States to press for their father’s release just days before Khan’s call for a nationwide protest on Aug 5, which has put the state on edge.Khan, arrested on Aug 5, 2023, remains behind bars despite some convictions being overturned. He is currently serving time in three major cases that his party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), claims are part of a broader effort to keep him out of politics.He was convicted in the Toshakhana case, involving the illegal sale of state gifts received during his premiership. He was sentenced in the cipher case, accused of leaking classified diplomatic correspondence for political gain. And in the Al-Qadir Trust case, Khan and his wife were held liable for controversial land deals linked to a charitable trust.PTI has consistently maintained that the charges are politically motivated, aimed at “eliminating the most popular leader” in the country.Now, with most of PTI’s senior leadership jailed, exiled, or forced to resign, Khan’s sons have taken the international route. Based in the UK, the brothers have held meetings in Washington DC with US lawmakers, policy groups and human rights organisations, and are reportedly preparing to testify before congressional panels.Their message: Imran Khan is being held in solitary confinement in inhumane conditions, denied light, medical access, and family contact.The campaign has triggered speculation about whether the two sons might return to Pakistan, possibly to appear at the planned protest. While PTI has not confirmed this, party insiders say their presence could act as a powerful morale boost for the party’s dispersed support base.Meanwhile, the state has moved swiftly to neutralise any protest momentum. On July 22, an anti-terror court in Lahore sentenced eight senior PTI leaders, including Dr Yasmin Rashid, to 10 years in prison for their alleged role in the May 9 riots, when military installations were targeted after Khan’s initial arrest. Observers see the convictions as a tactical strike to undercut mobilisation ahead of the Aug 5 protest. The verdicts have raised concerns among legal experts about the selective use of terrorism laws against political opponents.From prison, Khan has issued a call for unity among PTI ranks, urging supporters to “shun differences” and prepare for what he called a decisive moment for Pakistan’s democracy. But the party remains fractured and leaderless, with ongoing rifts between loyalists and factions seen as open to negotiations with the establishment.At the heart of the political storm is the army chief, Field Marshal Asim Munir, who was controversially elevated to five-star rank in May. PTI blames him, along with PML-N and PPP leaders, for orchestrating what it calls a civil-military clampdown to sideline Khan and crush dissent.In a recent prison note, Khan mocked Munir as the “King of the Jungle”, accusing him of ruling the country through “fear, not law”.","Sulaiman and Qasim Khan have launched an aggressive lobbying campaign in the United States to press for their father’s release.

These falsified materials were used to meet UK immigration criteria.One such forged application, including a bogus employment letter from a non-existent hospital riddled with grammatical errors, was successfully used to secure a UK work visa, it said.UK-based immigration lawyer Harjap Bhangal blamed the nation's ""broken system"" which was ""easy to manipulate"".“If you claim asylum before that visa runs out, you can still work.

"'Painful, disgusting': Balochistan CM on viral video of honour killing; vows prosecution of 14 arrested",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/painful-disgusting-balochistan-cm-on-viral-video-of-honour-killing-vows-prosecution-of-14-arrested/articleshow/122838789.cms,"Balochistan 'honour killing'





Balochistan chief minister Sarfraz Bugti has confirmed the arrest of a tribal chief who allegedly ordered the so-called honour killing of a couple accused of having an affair.Condemning the incident, Bugti on Monday said, ""No one has a right, no matter what, to kill someone in such a painful and disgusting way, and then video shoot it. It is a crime. It is a murder. ”""We will make sure that they all will be prosecuted,"" he added, as quoted by Reuters.The incident came to light after a disturbing video went viral on social media last month. The footage showed a group of men taking a man and woman from vehicles into a desert area in Balochistan, where they were shot at close range.A man is seen shooting the woman in the back, followed by images of the bloodied man lying near her body. The video then shows more gunfire aimed at both victims. ]According to provincial police chief Moazzam Jah Ansari, the woman’s brother carried out the shooting on behalf of her family and tribe. He added that Sher Baz Satakzai, the tribal chief, ordered the execution. Police have arrested 14 people in connection with the case, though it remains unclear if the brother is among them, according to Reuters.Chief minister Bugti said the man and woman both had children from previous marriages and were accused of having an affair out of wedlock. Earlier reports had suggested the couple may have been killed for marrying without family approval, according to Reuters.On Monday, a local court ordered police to exhume the victims’ bodies for autopsies as part of the investigation.Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari also condemned the killings, calling the accused “beasts” who deserve no leniency.The human rights commission of Pakistan criticised the rising trend of honour killings in the country, reporting at least 405 such cases in 2024 alone. Most victims, it noted, are women, and these murders are often carried out by relatives in the name of protecting family honour.","Balochistan chief minister Sarfraz Bugti has confirmed the arrest of a tribal chief who allegedly ordered the so-called honour killing of a couple.

TOI correspondent from Washington:

Asim Munir for President? Pakistan Defence Minister Denies Amid Buzz Of Asif Ali Zardari Quitting





A political and diplomatic dogfight is underway over a prospective visit to Pakistan by US President Donald Trump en route to the Quad summit in India in September amid a gradual recalibration of ties in the region.Pakistani business leaders and influencers are working overtime to convince the White House of a Trump visit after pulling off a coup by arranging a luncheon meeting last month for the country's army chief Asim Munir with the US President.Munir charmed Trump by endorsing him for a Nobel Peace Prize, playing up to his craving for one, and the Pakistanis are now promising the US President more honors and trade access if he visits, despite having thrown itself at China's feet for survival.Although the White House has not confirmed Trump's Quad attendance given New Delhi is yet to nail the dates -- which also depends on the leaders of Japan and Australia -- Pakistan's excitable media broadcast that the US President would visit Pakistan on September 18, before retracting the report because Trump will be on a state visit to the UK from September 17-19.There are indications though that Trump may stopover in Pakistan whenever he heads out to the Quad summit.This could be as late as November given the MAGA supremo's obsession with trade deals over strategic alignments. He has just delivered a tariff shock to Japan and also riled up Australia, while India has proved to be a tough negotiator, frustrating his trade boffins attempts to strong-arm New Delhi into a quick deal.In fact, Trump's fetish for tariffs and his fixation on trade deals puts a question mark over the strategic salience of the Quad even as long-time allies and partners adjust to his mercurial approach.According to some diplomats, India itself may have to reassess its approach to Trump-era Washington after a rosy-eyed view of long-term strategic ties with the US. They acknowledge that Trump’s response during his second term to the Pakistani outreach – driven more by opportunism than any strategic vision – clearly caught India off guard. New Delhi resents the re-hyphenation that would be implicit in such a two-fer, but has no way of thwarting it.If Trump does visit Pakistan, it will be the first US Presidential trip to the country in nearly two decades after George W Bush layover in 2006. Bush stopped by in Islamabad for a few hours under a tight security blanket on his way back from a three-day visit to New Delhi, talking up counter-terrorism cooperation with Pakistan while rejecting its pleas for a nuclear deal similar to the one he forged with India.Presidents Obama and Biden both disdained even a stopover while Trump himself trashed Pakistan during his first term, accusing it of ""nothing but lies & deceit"" and providing ""safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan.""Pakistan is now promising to turn itself into a safe haven for US businesses promoted by Trump associates -- including transforming Islamabad into the ""crypto capital of South Asia"" and a ""global leader in the digital finance revolution,’ -- to land a Presidential visit.During his first term, Trump is famously said to have complained about landing in Iraq and Afghanistan with the lights on Air Force One turned off (as a security measure), despite the US having spent billions on the countries. If the Pakistan stopover comes through, he may well insist on landing in full sight – to soak up the fanfare and flattery.","Pakistani business leaders and influencers are working overtime to convince the White House of a Trump visit. Pakistanis are now promising the US President more honors and trade access if he visits.

Over the past two days, Baloch insurgent groups have claimed responsibility for a string of deadly attacks on Pakistani military forces in Balochistan, reportedly killing at least 27 soldiers, according to The Balochistan Post.The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) said its Fateh Squad targeted a military transport bus in Kalat’s Nimargh Cross area, killing 27 troops and injuring several others.The bus was reportedly ferrying personnel from Karachi to Quetta. BLA spokesperson Jeeyand Baloch stated that civilians, including qawwali performers on board, were not intended targets, though Dawn reported three civilian deaths, including two qawwals.In another incident, the BLA claimed to have killed two soldiers and injured seven with a remote-controlled IED in Quetta’s Hazarganji area.The Balochistan Liberation Front (BLF) also announced two separate operations. On Tuesday, it said an IED blast in Kalat’s Khazina area killed four soldiers.

"China push: In Nepal, EVs now account for 76% of all vehicles sold",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/china-push-in-nepal-evs-now-account-for-76-of-all-vehicles-sold/articleshow/122960428.cms,"



KATHMANDU: The narrow streets of Kathmandu - sized for pedestrians and rickshaws - are choked with engines. Buses, motorbikes, small trucks and taxis fill the sprawling valley with horns and exhaust. For its more than 3 million residents, just getting around is a dangerous, eye-stinging ordeal.But recently, a new kind of motor has started to ease the crush. Sleek electric vehicles glide by with a quiet hum. Gleaming showrooms do a brisk business in the latest models, and charging stations on highways have turned into rest stops with cafes for drivers. Over the past year, EVs accounted for 76% of all passenger vehicles and half of the light commercial vehicles sold in Nepal. Five years ago, that number was essentially zero. The EV market share in Nepal is now behind only those of a few countries, including Norway, Singapore and Ethiopia. The average for all countries was 20% in 2024.The swift turnover is the result of govt policies aimed at leveraging Nepal's wealth of hydropower, easing dependence on imported fossil fuels and clearing the smog. It has been fed by an intense push from Nepal's biggest neighbour, China, world's dominant manufacturer of battery-powered vehicles.""For us, using EVs is a comparative advantage,"" said Mahesh Bhattarai, DG of Nepal's department of customs. ""In the global market, Chinese EVs are expanding. The same is happening in Nepal."" The effort stands in contrast to policies in the US and Europe, which have blocked Chinese EVs to protect their domestic auto industries. And it carries hope for other developing countries that seek to become wealthier without enduring the crucible of pollution from which many rich nations have already emerged.""We're interested in making sure this rapid growth in these emerging markets doesn't follow the same trajectory as developed markets,"" said the head of sustainable transportation for UN Environment Programme. But as Nepal has learned, there are obstacles. The country has spent heavily on subsidies, and getting rid of the support too quickly could derail the shift to battery power. Even if gas-powered passenger cars are phased out, cleaning the air will require public transportation to go electric as well.Asian Development Bank has been a key financier of Nepal's dams, transmission lines and charging networks. The head of ADB's resident mission in Nepa is cautious about the risk of backsliding. ""Given the economic sense this EV conversion represents, I think I would see it as unlikely that we would have major policy change.""Businesses and advocates are, however, concerned Nepal may already be backing off its commitment to the transition. It has had three PMs in past five years, and priorities have shifted with each of them. Nepal's central bank doubled down-payment requirements for EVs. Govt has been inching up its tariffs on EVs. And auto dealers worry faulty cars from some smaller Chinese brands could discredit the category. Rajan Babu Shrestha holds the licence to distribute cars in Nepal from Tata Motors. He has seen sales skyrocket on his EVs, but he could go back to selling gas-powered vehicles if tariffs rose or subsidies for charging stations went away. ""Stability is always a question mark.""","Electric vehicles account for 76% of all passenger vehicles and half of light commercial vehicles sold in Nepal.

Harry's olive branch







Prince Harry has agreed to share his official diary with the royal family to avoid clashes in public appearances and ease ongoing tensions.The move comes after his recent trip to Angola made headlines for revisiting princess Diana’s iconic anti-landmine walk, on the same day Queen Camilla's 78th birthday portrait was released. Harry’s photos reportedly overshadowed the coverage of the Queen’s milestone, which did not go down well with the palace.According to The Mail, Harry is now open to “deconflicting” his schedule with other senior royals, including Prince William’s team at Kensington palace.Their PR teams have reportedly kept in touch since private talks began earlier this year. In fact, aides from both camps were seen meeting at a London members club earlier this month.Harry is also quietly pushing for a more personal reconnection with his father. According to royal expert Hilary Fordwich, King Charles remains “cautious and wary” of Harry’s recent efforts. She said ,“Harry misses the UK and many aspects of royal life, but his return risks more disclosures, and that worries the family,” she added.Royal biographer Tom Bower told The Mirror that Harry is “seriously worried” about being permanently shut out.“He’s afraid that once Charles is gone, William will banish him from the UK entirely,” Bower said.This fear reportedly led to a discreet meeting at the Royal Over-Seas League in London last week. Harry’s aides flew in to meet King Charles’ top communications official, Tobyn Andreae. Witnesses said the two teams chatted on the garden terrace before moving indoors.

Then he said 'I've got a bomb, I've got a bomb' - at this point people were confused. I thought he was joking, I mean it's a weird joke.""According to the witness, the man grew aggressive toward the flight crew. He pushed the airline staff and was being aggressive towards them. He was a big guy, about six foot and they were these petite women,"" the passenger added, as cited by The Mirror.Flight attendants were seen in video footage clambering over seats to inspect the man’s bag, while three passengers managed to subdue him.The pilot quickly declared an emergency and initiated a rapid descent. ""The pilot announced he was making an emergency landing and took the plane down so quickly,"" the witness said. Initially, passengers feared the plane would divert to another airport, but it safely landed at Glasgow.Upon arrival, the aircraft was directed to a remote part of Glasgow Airport, where police officers boarded and arrested the man.","EasyJet flight from London Luton to Glasgow was forced to make an emergency landing on Sunday after a passenger allegedly issued bomb threats mid air.

A British woman has come under fire after having an issue over Marks & Spencer employees at London Heathrow Airport speaking in Hindi. Lucy White, who describes herself as a public policy specialist, shared her incident in a post on X, which quickly went viral and drew widespread criticism. Many accused her of racism and intolerance in a multicultural environment.White wrote that she had just arrived at Terminal 3 of the airport and visited the M&S store, where she overheard three staff members speaking in a language other than English. When she asked them what language they were speaking, the employees told her it was Hindi, the most widely spoken language in India.“I have a voice recording & their names to report to M&S. We must confront them every time,” she added.Her post drew backlash with users online calling her racist and many questioning why she found it offensive and what rules the employees had broken.This incident is not the first time White has faced criticism for similar remarks. A few weeks ago, she posted another tweet targeting Indian and Asian employees at Heathrow, claiming they spoke “not a word of English.” She added that when she asked them to speak English, they called her a “racist.”One user, on her latest post, commented, “Confront people who talk in a different language? No thanks. We should however confront vile bigots like yourself that make this country a much sadder, less friendlier place.”Another user said, “How embarrassing. Heaven forbid someone speaks more than one language if they work in a major international airport.”","Lucy White shared her incident in a post on X, which quickly went viral and drew widespread criticism.

Food crime: Cardiff men jailed for selling fake halal meat to restaurants; nearly 3 tonnes seized in raid,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/food-crime-cardiff-men-jailed-for-selling-fake-halal-meat-to-restaurants-nearly-3-tonnes-seized-in-raid/articleshow/122899671.cms,"



Two men from Cardiff have been sentenced after running a fraudulent meat supply operation that misled restaurants and takeaways into believing they were being sold halal chicken.Hamil Miah, 46, who ran Universal Food Wholesale Limited, was jailed for four years and eight months after being found guilty of fraud and trading while bankrupt. Noaf Rahman, also 46 and from Cardiff, pleaded guilty before the trial and was given a two-year suspended sentence for his role in the offences.The fraud was uncovered after a 2019 investigation led authorities to a warehouse in Cardiff, where 2,840 kg of frozen meat was seized. Officials from Cardiff and Vale Shared Regulatory Services discovered serious breaches of food hygiene, with meat transported in filthy vans, expiry dates tampered with, and no clear traceability of products.The court heard that, over five years, the pair supplied chicken to eateries across south and west Wales under the pretence that it was halal. In reality, much of it was not, and even where halal meat was purchased, it became contaminated in the warehouse, which was also used to process non-halal meat.Prosecutor Alex Greenwood told Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court that customers “were in fact consuming non-halal products as a result of the criminality of these two defendants.”The businesses buying the meat were unaware of the fraud, believing they were dealing with legitimate suppliers behind the “corporate veil,” BBC reported.Judge Vanessa Francis condemned the operation saying Miah and Rahman had a ""cavalier attitude"" and were equally responsible.She described the misconduct as a “disaster waiting to happen” and highlighted the widespread impact of their actions, noting, that the “harm in my view is extensive” and there were ""flagrant breaches over a significant period of time"".""This was a disaster waiting to happen and it is a matter of relief that it never did with the unsafe meat sent out of your premises,"" BBC cited the judge.The names of affected restaurants were not disclosed in court due to the sensitive nature of the case.","Hamil Miah, 46, and Noaf Rahman, also 46, ran Universal Food Wholesale Limited.

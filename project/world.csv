John Bolton vs Donald Trump: How the two indictments compare,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/john-bolton-vs-donald-trump-how-the-two-indictments-compare-a-closer-look/articleshow/124619679.cms,"John Bolton and Donald Trump (Images/Agencies)

Similarities in the cases

Differences in the charges





Former national security adviser John Bolton has been indicted over the handling of classified information, drawing comparisons to US President Donald Trump , who faced similar allegations in the past.Bolton, who served in the Trump administration for over a year before being fired in 2019, is accused of illegally sending classified information to two family members who did not have security clearances and of keeping copies of those messages at his Maryland home.The indictment follows an FBI search of Bolton’s Maryland residence and Washington office in August.Trump, meanwhile, was previously accused of unlawfully retaining classified documents after leaving the White House in January 2021 and obstructing government efforts to retrieve them from his Florida club and residence, Mar-a-Lago. That case was dismissed after Trump won the 2024 election.Both men were accused of handling classified data insecurely. Trump allegedly stored boxes of sensitive information in unsecured locations at Mar-a-Lago, including a bathroom and a ballroom stage, according to New York Times.Bolton is accused of transmitting classified material through personal email accounts and an encrypted messaging app that were not approved for sensitive information.One of Bolton’s email accounts was reportedly hacked by Iran in 2021.Both faced multiple counts of unauthorized retention of national defense information, with Trump charged with 38 counts and Bolton with eight.In both cases, prosecutors cited public statements made by Trump and Bolton criticizing others for mishandling classified information.Trump had previously criticized Hillary Clinton ’s handling of classified information in 2016, while Bolton had criticized Trump officials in 2025 for discussing sensitive military plans on an unsecured messaging app. These statements were cited to show that both understood the rules regarding classified information.The cases also diverged in key ways. Trump faced additional obstruction charges, including allegations that he conspired to conceal documents and misled investigators.Bolton, in contrast, was charged with unauthorized transmission offenses for sharing information with relatives, but was not charged with obstruction.Another notable difference is the timing. Both men previously avoided certain legal consequences due to elections. Trump’s case was dismissed after his 2024 election victory, while an earlier investigation into Bolton’s handling of classified information in 2020 was dropped after the former President Joe Biden 's administration took office in 2021.The news emerged as Trump spoke to reporters in the Oval Office. The president said he was unaware of the indictment and criticised Bolton, calling him a “bad person” and “a bad guy”.“I think he’s a bad person,” Trump said. “He’s a bad guy.” He added, “That’s the way it goes, right?” he said. Bolton is expected to surrender to federal authorities in Greenbelt, Maryland, as early as Friday, CNN reported.",Bolton is accused of illegally sending classified information to two family members who did not have security clearances.

In a major stride toward digital government transformation, the UAE’s Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MoHRE) has introduced an artificial intelligence-based system named 'Eye'. Announced at GITEX Global 2025, the system aims to revolutionise the way work permits are issued by reducing bureaucracy, improving efficiency, and eliminating human error through automated document verification.The ‘Eye’ system, developed and deployed by MoHRE, is designed to automate the entire work permit application process by integrating an advanced AI Agent. This agent is capable of verifying critical documents such as:By cross-checking and validating the authenticity and accuracy of each document, the system reduces the dependency on human staff to process applications. Manual intervention will only be required in exceptional cases, as the system is built to handle most scenarios autonomously.According to MoHRE, this marks a ""significant advancement in accelerating work permit issuance"" and aligns with the UAE’s broader efforts to digitise government operations and improve service delivery.Rashid Hassan Al Saadi, Acting Assistant Undersecretary for Labour Market Services at MoHRE, described the initiative as a milestone in digital innovation. He emphasised that:The introduction of ‘Eye’ supports the UAE government’s long-standing push to streamline administrative procedures.In June 2024, the UAE expanded an initiative to reduce the processing time for residency visas and work permits from 30 days to just 5 days.Additionally, the rollout of ‘Eye’ is part of a larger policy framework inspired by the Zero Government Bureaucracy programme, launched by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai. In this initiative, the government committed to eliminating 2,000 unnecessary procedures within a year. As of June this year, service delivery time had already been reduced by over 70% in its first phase.MoHRE currently issues 13 types of work permits, depending on the nature of the job and the sector of employment. These permits are legally required for any individual who wishes to work in the UAE. According to UAE Labour Law:To apply for a work permit, applicants must submit:The 'Eye' system aims to digitise and accelerate verification of all these documents, thereby speeding up approvals and reducing errors that might delay application processing.Beyond the launch of ‘Eye’, MoHRE showcased several other technology-driven initiatives at GITEX Global 2025, reflecting its ongoing commitment to digital transformation. These include:These initiatives are aligned with the UAE Government’s broader vision of leading globally in AI adoption and ensuring an efficient, agile, and business-friendly regulatory environment.","The UAE’s Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MoHRE) has introduced an artificial intelligence-based system named 'Eye' The system aims to revolutionise the way work permits are issued by reducing bureaucracy, improving efficiency, and eliminating human error through automated document verification.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124615039,imgsize-911785,width-400,resizemode-4/uae-work-permit-ai.jpg"

Caribbean strikes the trigger?

Who is Admiral Alvin Holsey









Admiral Alvin Holsey, who leads the US Southern Command overseeing operations across Central and South America, announced on Thursday that he is retiring from service.In his role, Holsey has overseen ongoing operations targeting suspected drug-carrying vessels in the Caribbean.""It's been an honour to serve our nation, the American people and support and defend the Constitution for over 37 years. Effective 12 December 2025 I will retire from the US Navy,"" he said in a statement on the Southern Command's X account without an explanation for his early departure.Holsey had been leading the Doral, Florida-headquartered Southern Command since November 2024.""The SOUTHCOM team had made lasting contributions to the defense of our nation and will continue to do so. I am confident that you will forge ahead, focusing on your mission that strengthens our nation and ensures it longevity as a becaon of freedom around the globe,"" he added.Secretary of defense Pete Hegseth thanked the retiring naval aviator on social media: “On behalf of the Department of War, we extend our deepest gratitude to Admiral Alvin Holsey for his more than 37 years of distinguished service to our nation as he plans to retire at year's end.The Department thanks Admiral Holsey for his decades of service to our country, and we wish him and his family continued success and fulfillment in the years ahead. ”So far, US forces have carried out at least five strikes— and a possible sixth —against alleged drug-smuggling vessels in the Caribbean, leaving 27 people dead in the first five attacks, a campaign that some experts have described as “illegal.”According to CNN, tensions had been ""simmering"" between Hegseth and Holsey for weeks before the admiral announced he was leaving.""Hegseth did not believe Holsey was moving quickly or aggressively enough to combat drug traffickers in the Caribbean. SOUTHCOM was also concerned about the operations not being lawful,"" sources said.The tensions ""came to a head"" during a meeting between Hegseth, Holsey and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Dan Caine on October 6 at the Pentagon. Holsey offered his resignation, but his departure was not announced until over a week later.A native of Fort Valley, Georgia, Admiral Alvin Holsey joined the Navy in 1988 through the NROTC (Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps) programme at Morehouse College. Over his 37-year career, he commanded helicopter squadrons, led Carrier Strike Group One, served as Military Deputy Commander, and ultimately became Commander of the US Southern Command.","Admiral Alvin Holsey, who leads the US Southern Command, announced on Thursday that he is retiring from service.

'Kyiv Plotting...': Putin Aide's BIG Warning If American Tomahawks Arrive In Russian Backyard

Eight regions hit by blackouts

.

Zelenskyy’s Washington mission





Ukraine suffered widespread blackouts after Russia launched one of its heaviest attacks on the country’s power grid, firing hundreds of drones and dozens of missiles overnight, officials said Thursday.The strikes crippled energy facilities across several regions, leaving millions without electricity as winter approaches.Days ago, a Russian strike on an energy facility in the town of Slavutych in Kyiv Oblast caused a several-hour blackout at the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant on October 1, according to the Energy Ministry.This comes after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy prepared to meet US President Donald Trump in Washington on Friday, where he is expected to request more American-made air defense systems and long-range missiles to counter Russian attacks.Trump, who spoke by phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday, said they plan to meet in Budapest, Hungary, to “try to bring the war to an end,” though no date has been set.In a post on Truth Social, Trump said he would discuss his conversation with Putin “and much more” during his meeting with Zelenskyy, adding that “great progress was made” during the call.Ukraine’s national energy operator, Ukrenergo, said eight regions experienced power outages after the barrage.DTEK, the country’s largest private energy firm, reported major disruptions in Kyiv and said it had to halt natural gas extraction in the Poltava region due to damage. State-owned Naftogaz said gas infrastructure was hit for the sixth time this month.Zelenskyy said Russia launched over 300 drones and 37 missiles, accusing Moscow of using cluster munitions and repeatedly targeting the same sites to hinder emergency repairs. ""This fall, the Russians are using every single day to strike our energy infrastructure,"" he said on Telegram.The power grid has remained one of Russia’s key targets throughout the war. Ukrainian officials say Moscow is ""weaponizing winter"" by attacking energy facilities ahead of the cold season, a claim Russia denies, saying it only strikes military targets.Ukraine has responded by targeting Russian oil refineries crucial to its war effort. The Ukrainian military said it struck the Saratov oil refinery in southern Russia on Thursday, the second such attack in two months, as reported by news agency AP.Zelenskyy in a post on X wrote: ""Nothing has changed for Russia – it is still terrorizing life in Ukraine. A swarm of drones struck Kryvyi Rih, hitting civilian infrastructure. There were dozens more attack drones in our skies. Missiles were also spotted. In fact, not a single night in recent weeks has passed without Russian strikes on Ukraine. Most of the targets are infrastructure – a systematic campaign of terror against our energy sector. ""Zelenskyy is expected to seek cruise missiles, air defense systems and joint drone production agreements from the United States. Kyiv is also pushing for tougher sanctions on Moscow.The visit comes amid signs that Trump may increase pressure on Putin to make progress in peace negotiations. US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth warned Wednesday that if Russia refuses to engage in talks, Washington ""will take the steps necessary to impose costs on Russia for its continued aggression.""Trump on Wednesday said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had assured him that India would stop purchasing Russian oil, a move that could further squeeze Moscow’s war finances.Although Washington has hesitated to send long-range missiles such as Tomahawks over fears of escalation, the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War said such a move would “mirror Russia’s own use of long-range cruise missiles” and not widen the conflict.Meanwhile, Ukraine’s Economy Ministry announced a new partnership with US aerospace company Bell Textron Inc. to boost domestic aviation technology. The Texas-based firm plans to open an office and testing center in Ukraine while training local engineers in the United States.During its visit to the US, a Ukrainian delegation also held talks with major American defense manufacturers, including Lockheed Martin and Raytheon, as Kyiv looks to strengthen its own arms industry amid uncertain future aid from Western allies.","Ukraine suffered widespread blackouts after Russia launched one of its heaviest attacks on the country’s power grid, firing hundreds of drones and dozens of missiles overnight.

US President Donald Trump would “love” to see Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy meet to discuss ending the war in Ukraine, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.“He thinks it’s possible and would love to see it happen,” Leavitt told reporters on Thursday.Her comments came shortly after Trump and Putin—who last met in Alaska on August 15— held a phone call ahead of Trump’s scheduled meeting with Zelenskyy at the White House on Friday.Following the call, Trump said he and Putin will meet again - in Budapest, Hungary - though he did not specify a date. He added that high-level advisors from both sides will hold preparatory talks next week, suggesting the summit could take place soon. The US leader noted that his delegation will be led by secretary of state Marco Rubio.During Friday’s meeting, Zelenskyy is expected to push for the supply of Tomahawk missiles and other long-range US weapons capable of striking targets inside Russia.The war in Ukraine began in February 2022.

""Even after affording great deference to the president's evaluation of the circumstances, we see insufficient evidence of a rebellion or danger of rebellion in Illinois,"" the court stated.""The spirited, sustained, and occasionally violent actions of demonstrators in protest of the federal government's immigration policies and actions, without more, does not give rise to a danger of rebellion against the government's authority.""""The administration remains barred from deploying the National Guard of the United States within Illinois,"" the court added.Illinois and the city of Chicago initiated the lawsuit to prevent the deployment, a strategy also employed by authorities in Oregon to block the sending of National Guard troops to Portland.

US shutdown: Deadlock to enter third week as Senate rejects stopgap funding bill for 10th time —Who to be blamed?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-shutdown-deadlock-to-enter-third-week-as-senate-rejects-stopgap-funding-bill-for-10th-time-who-to-be-blamed/articleshow/124613451.cms,"'WE'RE HOSTAGES': Karoline EXPLODES At Schumer; Lashes Dems For Paralysing Trump Govt Amid Shutdown

How much will it cost government?





Who to be blamed?









The Senate voted down the House-passed spending patch for the tenth time on Thursday, as the government shutdown continued with no end in sight. Because the chamber does not plan to be in legislative session again until Monday, it nearly ensures the funding lapse will reach the three-week mark at midnight Tuesday.Senate Majority Leader John Thune continued to force votes on the GOP-led stopgap, while Democratic senators showed no signs of breaking rank and voting in support, Politico reported.The same Democrats who had been voting against the legislation in recent days continued to cast “no” votes on Thursday to advance the measure that would fund the govt through November 21.Independent Senator Angus King of Maine, who caucuses with Democrats, voted again in support of the Republican-led stopgap, along with Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania and Senator Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada.However, one new variable emerged this week that could help end the stalemate: Thune is hoping to initiate floor debate on individual spending bills that would fund federal agencies for a full year, starting with the Pentagon and possibly also the departments of Health and Human Services, Labor and Education.As the time of Shutdown extended, the cost on governmten would also increase.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned that the ongoing government shutdown could be taking a heavy toll on the US economy.Speaking at a news conference, Bessent said the partial shutdown, now entering its third week, is “starting to cut into muscle here.”He initially suggested the shutdown could cost the economy as much as $15 billion per day, though the Treasury later clarified he meant $15 billion per week. The shutdown began on October 1 after Congress and the White House failed to pass a funding bill for fiscal year 2026, according to Fox Business.Bessent urged moderate Senate Democrats to “be heroes” by breaking with party leadership and supporting the Senate Republicans’ continuing resolution to reopen the government for Americans.Neither Republicans nor Democrats are ready to flinch in their deeply entrenched positions, and talks between both sides, though largely informal exercises, have begun to fade.A new AP-NORC poll shows Americans view it as a serious problem—and assign blame across the political spectrum.About 60% of respondents say President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans bear “a great deal” or “quite a bit” of responsibility, while 54% say the same about congressional Democrats. Overall, at least three-quarters of Americans hold each party accountable to some extent, signaling widespread frustration, AP news reported.The standoff has escalated over Democrats’ push to extend pandemic-era tax credits and Republicans’ refusal to negotiate without a funding bill.While both sides aim to cast blame on the other, the poll suggests the party in power faces slightly more public frustration, with half of Americans pointing to Trump as most responsible. Voters like Sophia Cole, a Republican from St. Louis, see blame on both sides but emphasize the president’s role in brokering a deal.The poll finds that 54% of adults call the shutdown a “major issue,” with just 11% saying it is “not a problem at all.” Democrats are most likely, at 69%, to see it as a major problem, but 59% of independents and 37% of Republicans feel the same way.","The Senate voted down the House-passed spending patch for the tenth time on Thursday.

Ave Maria University is set to unveil a new sculpture honouring the late conservative activist and Trump ally Charlie Kirk The piece will depict Jesus Christ embracing Kirk. It is expected to become part of the university's permanent art collection early next year.The sculpture was inspired by Kirk’s death on September 10, when he was shot during a campus event at Utah Valley University by a 22-year-old Tommy Robinson.The piece was created by Canadian artist Timothy Schmalz, who expects the sculpture to be completed within the next three to four months, reports Wink News.""I was so, so moved by this horrific event that I had to share with everyone the sculpture that I was working on in my studio,"" Schmalz said. ""Being a parent, and having a conversation with your children about this world that we live in, it just made me.

VIDEO: Hamas Fighters Release Seven Israeli Hostages From Gaza Amid Loud Cheer From Palestinians





Hamas published a video on Monday showing eight blindfolded and kneeling men being executed in the streets, branding them ""collaborators and outlaws.""The footage surfaced amid armed clashes between Hamas security units and Palestinian clans, on the fifth day of a US-brokered truce between Israel and the militant group.Hamas proceeded to take control of Gaza on Tuesday, even as US President Donald Trump vowed to disarm the group under a recently brokered ceasefire.The Israeli military confirmed that the remains of four more hostages held in Gaza were handed to the Red Cross, following the release of four others and the safe return of 20 surviving captives.In northern Gaza, as Israeli forces withdrew from Gaza City, Hamas’s black-masked police resumed street patrols. Hamas’s Brigades helped control crowds when freed prisoners arrived in Gaza on Monday. A new Hamas security unit, called the Deterrence Force, has been targeting armed clans and gangs, some of which are said to have Israeli support.Hamas has dominated Gaza since 2007 after defeating rival faction Fatah. Israel insists Hamas must not play any role in a future Gaza government, hand back the remains of 24 deceased hostages, and eventually disarm.Trump has warned that those who refuse to surrender their weapons will be forcibly disarmed. The US-brokered 20-point peace plan, endorsed by world powers at a Trump-led summit in Egypt, demands a demilitarised Gaza and no leadership role for Hamas.Meanwhile, Israeli families continued pressing for the return of the remains of 24 hostages still held by Hamas.The Israeli army confirmed four more bodies were transferred to the Red Cross and on their way to custody. The military identified two victims as Guy Iluz, an Israeli national, and Bipin Joshi, an agriculture student from Nepal.

New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani has reiterated his call for the city to “honour” the International Criminal Court (ICC) warrant against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over alleged war crimes in Gaza.The Indian-origin politician has previously stated that, if elected mayor, he would “arrest” Netanyahu should the Israeli leader visit the city.""I’ve said that this is a city that believes international law, and this is a city that wants to uplift and uphold those beliefs,"" Mamdani told Fox News’ ""The Story"" show on Wednesday.Anchor Martha MacCallum noted that the US is not a signatory to the ICC, which Mamdani acknowledged. He stressed, however, that “The ICC… has issued a warrant for the arrest of Benjamin Netanyahu, as it has for Vladimir Putin (over alleged war crimes in Ukraine). I believe that we should uphold arrest warrants by the International Criminal Court and that we would… do so only in abiding with all of the laws in front of us. ”The Democratic candidate clarified that he would not create new legislation to arrest Netanyahu. “I can tell you that I’m going to exhaust every legal option in front of me, not to make new laws to do so,” he added, responding to a question about whether the NYPD would allow him to arrest the Israeli leader.During his recent US visit, Netanyahu avoided flying over countries that are ICC signatories and could have arrested him in their airspace.Mamdani, 33, who would become New York’s first Muslim mayor if elected and is a vocal critic of Donald Trump, also declined to credit the US president for last week’s ceasefire and hostage-prisoner swap between Israel and Hamas. “To any extent, credit or not, I think it's too early to say. But if it proves to be lasting and durable, then that’s where you give credit,” he said.He also avoided commenting directly on whether Hamas would “lay down their arms” in Gaza, emphasizing that his focus is on justice, safety, and adherence to international law. “Anything has to abide by international law, and that applies to Hamas, the Israeli military, anyone you could ask me about,” Mamdani remarked.The mayoral election in New York is scheduled for November 4. Mamdani faces Republican Curtis Silwa and former New York state governor Andrew Cuomo, who is running as an independent.","New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani has reiterated his call for the city to ""honour"" the International Criminal Court (ICC) warrant against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

Why Bolton became a

Trump critic

Others facing Trump's wrath





Former US National Security Adviser (NSA) John Bolton, who served during Donald Trump’s first term and has since become a vocal critic, has been indicted on charges of ""mishandling classified information.""Bolton, 76, who served as the 26th NSA from April 2018 to September 2019, is the latest perceived “foe” of the Trump administration to face criminal charges in recent weeks.He also served as the US envoy to the United Nations - a post he held from August 2005 to December 2006 under George W Bush.The veteran diplomat was charged by a federal grand jury in Maryland with 18 counts of transmitting and retaining classified information, AFP reported.The 26-page indictment alleges that Bolton emailed “top secret documents” to ""two unauthorised individuals,"" believed to be his wife and daughter, using a non-government email or messaging app. The materials, described as “diary-life” entries about his work as NSA, total over 1,000 pages.According to the Justice Department, the documents “revealed intelligence about future attacks, foreign adversaries, and foreign-policy relations.”Attorney general Pam Bondi said in a statement, “Anyone who abuses a position of power and jeopardises our national security will be held accountable. No one is above the law.”Bolton rejected the charges in a statement to the media, saying, “I become the latest target in weaponising the Justice Department... with charges that were declined before or distort the facts.”Trump told reporters that his former aide is a “bad guy” and added, “that’s the way it goes.”Each of the 18 counts against the ex-NSA carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.In his statement, Bolton, who had been under FBI investigation and whose residence was raided in September, reflected on his time in Trump’s first administration, saying he “devoted my life to America’s foreign policy and national security and would never compromise those goals.”However, he added that he ""resigned"" when it become “impossible” for him to continue.Bolton also linked the indictment to his book, ""The Room Where It Happened,"" which was highly critical of Trump. “The retribution against me began then, continued when he tried unsuccessfully to block the publication of my book before the 2020 election, and became one of his rallying cries in his re-election campaign,” he remarked.The indictment follows the filing of criminal charges by the Justice Department against two other prominent Trump critics -New York attorney general Letitia James and former FBI director James Comey.James, who successfully prosecuted Trump for financial fraud, was indicted by a grand jury in Virginia on October 9 on charges of bank fraud and making false statements related to a property she purchased in 2020 in Norfolk, Virginia.Comey pleaded not guilty on October 8 to charges of making false statements to Congress and obstructing a congressional proceeding.Both have rejected the charges and alleged ""political retribution.""","Former US National Security Adviser (NSA) John Bolton has been indicted on charges of ""mishandling classified information"" The 76-year-old served as the 26th NSA from April 2018 to September 2019.

The US military reportedly carried out a new strike on an alleged drug-carrying vessel in the Caribbean on Thursday.However, unlike its five previous attacks that killed at least 27 suspected narco-terrorists, some crew members survived this latest operation, according to US officials cited by Reuters.More details are awaited as the Pentagon is yet to confirm the strike.The fifth such strike was conducted on October 14, killing six. The operations have been going on since last month against what the Trump administration has described as its ""war against narco-terrorism.""In some cases, the US president himself has posted videos of the strikes to his Truth Social platform and alleged the boats were carrying drugs.The operations have raised alarms among some legal experts and Democratic lawmakers, who question whether these adhere to the laws of war.

‘Modi loves Trump... he is a great leader’, says US president





WASHINGTON/NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump on Wednesday claimed he was assured by PM Narendra Modi on Wednesday that New Delhi was tapering its purchase of Russian oil to help stop the Russia-Ukraine war, but the external affairs ministry in Delhi denied knowledge of any such conversation.In Washington, in his customary freewheeling banter with pool reporters in the White House, Trump indicated that India’s pledge was conveyed through the new US ambassador to India, Sergio Gor, who was present in the Oval Office to brief the president about his meeting with Modi and India’s ministry of external affairs (MEA) earlier this week in New Delhi.“He’s assured me, there will be no oil purchase from Russia. I don’t know. Maybe that’s a breaking story. Can I say that? Would you say there will be no oil?” Trump said, waving towards Gor, and adding, “He’s not buying his oil from Russia.”New Delhi responded with a carefully worded statement that “it has been our consistent priority to safeguard the interests of the Indian consumer in a volatile energy scenario” and that it is broad-basing its energy sourcing. While there was no explicit denial by India of Trump’s claim, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal did say that he wasn’t aware of any conversation between Modi and Trump on Wednesday.India also didn’t confirm if there was any discussion on this issue when the leaders last spoke, on October 9.India also didn’t confirm if there was any discussion on this issue when the leaders last spoke, on October 9. The MEA statement didn’t directly refer to Trump’s remarks and the ministry said it was responding to media queries on comments on India’s energy sourcing. India’s response also underscored the fact that as far as the US is concerned, India has for years sought to expand its energy procurement. “This has steadily progressed in the last decade. The current government has shown interest in deepening energy cooperation with India. Discussions are ongoing,” said the official.Trump also conceded that India’s oil purchases may not stop immediately. “It started... It’s a little bit of a process, but the process is going to be over with soon,” he said, adding that he would also try and get China to stop buying Russian oil in an effort to stop the war. Once this oil revenue spigot for Moscow is turned off and war is over, Trump indicated India could go back to purchasing Russian oil.His hypothesis that Moscow would end the war if it does not get oil revenues from India and China is among the reasons holding up a trade deal between Washington and New Delhi. Both sides are said to be close to an agreement, with India indicating it is open to stepping up US energy purchases even as it draws down on buying Russian oil, although officials privately fumethe Trump’s performative public diplomacy tends to queer the pitch.Trump called Modi a “great man” and India “an incredible country”, and claimed that “he (Modi) loves Trump”. “Now, I don’t know if the word love… I don’t want you to take that any different... I don’t want to destroy his political career, but you have to understand… I’ve watched India for years... every single year you’d have a new leader. I mean, some would be in there for a few months, and this was year after year after year. And my friend has been there now for a long time, and he is, and he’s assured me, there will be no oil purchase from Russia,” the US president said.",US President Donald Trump claimed he was assured by PM Narendra Modi on Wednesday that New Delhi was tapering its purchase of Russian oil.

What is the new parole fee?





The $1,000 parole fee applies to all aliens granted parole under INA Section 212(d)(5)(A), including initial parole, re-parole, parole in place, or parole from DHS custody, unless they qualify for one of ten statutory exemptions.sThis new fee was mandated by the One Big Beautiful Bill. The fee is “in addition” to any other existing USCIS filing or biometric fee; it does not replace them. The parole will not be granted until the fee is paid as instructed and within the time. The fee is not to be paid when the applicant submits Form I-131. The USCIS will notify the applicants if the parole being granted requires payment. The fee will be collected by the three DHS components responsible for parole decisions: U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).

Who are exempt from the new parole fee





Those who are already in the US and not being newly paroled in. Those who are granted parole to serve as witnesses, informants or cooperate with investigations. USCIS or CBP can waive the fee for very limited urgent medical or life-saving reasons (like immediate medical evacuation or protection from imminent danger).





The US Citizenship and Immigration Services has notified the new immigration parole fee of $1,000 required from now on for certain types of migrants. Parole is a temporary permission to enter and stay in the US without visa or other formal admission status and it is allowed only for certain conditions which can be humanitarian or of public interest.""USCIS will collect the immigration parole fee if you are physically present in the United States and we are granting you parole or a new period of parole (also known as re-parole). Beginning on Oct. 16, 2025, if we determine that we can approve your request for parole or re-parole and that it requires payment of the immigration parole fee, we will notify you that you must pay this fee before we can approve your request. The notice will have payment instructions and a deadline. We will not grant parole unless you pay the immigration parole fee as instructed and within the specified time period,"" USCIS said.","US Citizenship and Immigration Services has notified the new immigration parole fee of $1,000 required from now on for certain types of migrants.

Senator Mitch McConnell had an unexpected “hall pass” on Thursday—literally.

A spokesman for McConnell told The Independent that the senator is “all good.”McConnell, the longest-serving party leader in the upper chamber’s history, has been under intense scrutiny regarding his health following several public incidents where he appeared to freeze while speaking to reporters.Earlier this year, he reportedly suffered two falls and experienced a similar incident in December inside the Capitol, resulting in minor injuries. McConnell, who has walked with a limp after recovering from polio at a young age, returned to the Senate shortly after with a bandage on his cheek.In 2023, McConnell froze while speaking on at least two occasions and was absent from the Senate for weeks after tripping at a Washington dinner, sustaining a concussion and a minor rib fracture.

Bangladesh, Canada or US: Where will Shahriar go?









Mahin Shahriar, a Bangladeshi man seeking asylum in Canada, has been arrested by the ICE in Buffalo after he was found in the US illegally, though he said he crossed the border by mistake. Canadian authorities said they won't take him back, the Canadian Press reported. The situation which led the man to US soil was strange as Shahriar said he was asked by a friend to reach the location. He said as he was suffering from depression and wanted some time out of his home, he was offered help by his friend who sent him to a particular location. But the location was near the border, on US soil.Shahriar said he has been in Canada since 2019 and worked as an Uber driver to support his family in Canada, which includes his mother, also a refugee, and his sister who is attending school in Canada full-time. Shahriar said he wanted to spend some time alone and a friend offered a place.The place was close to the Canada-US border, Shahriar found out as he was following the instructions of his friend over a phone call. ""Then I found myself in the US. It was not my intention,"" he said.When Shahriar understood that he was in the US, he approached the border patrol officers to explain his situation but he was taken into custody.ICE reportedly told Shahriar's lawyer Washim Ahmed that they won't compel Canada to accept Shahriar.They can't deport Shahriar to Bangladesh as they don't have his travel documents. Also, Shahriar is at risk of torture and detention if he returns to Bangladesh, they said.Ahmed said he is working to schedule an urgent Federal Court hearing to press the CBSA (Canada Border Services Agency) to accept Shahriar’s transfer to Canada on humanitarian and compassionate grounds.“Regardless of what status he may have had prior to leaving Canada, he was a resident of Canada,” Ahmed said. “He was the resident of Canada and he had his first blood family member in Canada, his sister and his mother. Both of them are maintaining valid legal status.”Shahriar signed US immigration documents on September 24, saying he is not seeking protection in the US due to his family being approved for asylum in Canada and his own pending asylum application.","Mahin Shahriar, a Bangladeshi man seeking asylum in Canada, has been arrested by the ICE in Buffalo.

Renewed focus









US President Donald Trump said he had a “very productive” phone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin , describing it as a step towards ending the war in Ukraine.The two leaders agreed to hold a meeting of senior advisers next week, led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, with Trump and Putin set to meet later in Budapest, Hungary. Trump said he will also meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office tomorrow.In a post on Truth Social, Trump said Putin had congratulated him and the United States on the “Great Accomplishment of Peace in the Middle East,” calling it something “dreamed of for centuries.” Trump added, “I actually believe that the Success in the Middle East will help in our negotiation in attaining an end to the War with Russia/Ukraine.”Trump also said that Putin thanked First Lady Melania Trump for her “involvement with children” and expressed appreciation for her efforts.Earlier today, Trump said he was holding a phone call with Putin. Trump announced the call on Truth Social, stating he would provide an update afterwards.The conversation comes just before Trump’s scheduled meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday, where missile support is expected to top the agenda.Zelenskyy has argued that equipping Kyiv with Tomahawks—capable of striking deep into Russian territory—could push Putin towards serious negotiations.On Sunday, during a visit to Israel, Trump said he intended to raise the missile issue with Putin, adding, “Do they want to have Tomahawks going in that direction? I don’t think so.”Tomahawk missiles are long-range, precision-guided cruise missiles used by the US military. Developed in the 1970s, they have been a key weapon in numerous conflicts, first used in combat during the 1991 Gulf War. These missiles are launched from ships or land-based platforms and can travel over 1,000 miles at speeds of up to 550 mph, making them highly effective for striking distant targets.With advanced guidance systems, they can navigate around obstacles and avoid enemy defences.Typically, Tomahawks carry warheads equivalent to around 400 pounds of TNT. Their ability to fly at low altitudes and high speeds makes them difficult to detect by radar. These capabilities make them a valuable asset in modern warfare.Following the fragile ceasefire in Gaza, Trump has shifted focus to ending the war in Ukraine, central to his 2024 re-election bid. Despite past frustrations with Putin, Trump expressed renewed confidence: “Interestingly we made progress today, because of what’s happened in the Middle East.”Trump is also weighing further economic pressure on Russia. Zelenskyy is expected to urge additional sanctions. While Trump has resisted sweeping measures, he claimed India had agreed to stop buying Russian oil—a key revenue source for Moscow.Meanwhile, the White House is quietly reviewing Senate legislation imposing heavy tariffs on Russian exports. Though Trump hasn’t publicly backed it, officials say it aligns with his foreign policy—provided it offers “complete flexibility.”","US President Donald Trump said he had a “very productive” phone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Pakistani PM Shehbaz Sharif said on Thursday that Islamabad was ready to hold talks with Afghanistan to resolve their conflict, as a temporary ceasefire that halted days of fierce fighting between the former allies largely held. The neighbouring nations engaged in ground fighting and Pakistan launched airstrikes across the contested frontier, killing dozens and wounding hundreds before agreeing to a 48-hour truce from 6.30pm on Wednesday.Sharif told his cabinet in Islamabad that Pakistan had “retaliated” as it ran out of patience with Afghanistan following a series of militant attacks. “If they want to talk on our valid conditions and want to resolve through dialogue we are ready for that,” Sharif said. “This message has been given to them yesterday. Now the ball is in their court. If this ceasefire is done just to buy time, we will not accept it.”There was no response to his remarks from Kabul.A statement from the Afghaninterior ministry said interior minister Khalifa Sirajuddin Haqqani met Iranian officials and told them that Afghanistan seeks good relations with all countries. “Just as we respect the sovereignty and dignity of others, we expect the same goodwill and respect toward us,” the statement quoted Haqqani as saying.At least 18 civilians were killed and more than 360 wounded in Afghanistan as a result of the fighting since Oct 10, the UN assistance mission in Afghanistan said.",Pakistani PM Shehbaz Sharif says Islamabad is ready to hold talks with Afghanistan to resolve their conflict.

'Had detailed discussions with Taliban foreign minister'







NEW DELHI: The ministry of external affairs (MEA) on Thursday sharply criticised Pakistan over its recent hostilities with Afghanistan, while emphasising India’s commitment to Afghanistan’s sovereignty.Speaking on the tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, ""Three things are clear. One, Pakistan hosts terrorist organisations and sponsors terrorist activities. Two, it is an old practice of Pakistan to blame its neighbours for its own internal failures. Three, Pakistan is infuriated with Afghanistan exercising sovereignty over its own territories. India remains fully committed to the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Afghanistan. ""In recent weeks, Pakistan has carried out targeted strikes in Kabul and other Taliban-controlled areas following a series of violent attacks by the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) on Pakistani territory.The Taliban government had then launched the offensive in ""retaliation for air strikes carried out by the Pakistani army on Kabul.""The Taliban had carried out operations along parts of the border with Pakistan, prompting Islamabad to promise a strong response.A 48-hour ceasefire between Afghanistan and Pakistan took hold late on Wednesday.The Pakistan Taliban operates independently of Afghanistan’s Taliban, but the two groups share ideological alignment. Pakistan has accused Kabul of giving shelter to TTP leaders and other groups, including the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and the ISIL affiliate in Khorasan Province (ISKP).TTP attacks have increased sharply since the Taliban returned to power in Afghanistan in August 2021, reflecting a growing trend in violence.During Afghan foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi's recent visit to India, external affairs minister S Jaishankar had announced that India will upgrade its technical mission in Afghanistan to a full embassy.When asked about the development and India’s stand on recognising Afghanistan’s Taliban government, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, “We had detailed discussions with foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi covering humanitarian aid, development cooperation, and upgrading our embassy.

Can Pakistan sustain new approach?







The recent deadly clashes between Pakistan and the Taliban along their shared border signal a major shift in Islamabad's approach towards a group that it had hoped would become an ally in its larger fight against India.Far from becoming a partner, the Taliban has now emerged as the single-biggest threat to Pakistan's security.With Pakistan launching strikes inside Taliban-held Afghan territory and the Taliban responding with attacks on Pakistani outposts and armored tanks, analysts suggest that Pakistan is attempting to establish a 'new normal' in its dealings with the Taliban.This evolving posture strikingly echoes India's decisive stance against Pakistan following Operation Sindoor earlier this year.In the past few weeks, Pakistan has carried out targeted strikes in Kabul and other Taliban-controlled areas after a series of violent attacks by the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan ( TTP ) on Pakistani territory.The Pakistan Taliban is independent of Afghanistan's Taliban, but the two groups are ideologically aligned.Islamabad blames Kabul for giving sanctuary to TTP leaders, as well as other groups such as the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and ISIL (ISIS) affiliate in Khorasan Province, or ISKP.TTP attacks have increased sharply since the Taliban returned to power in Afghanistan in August 2021, and numbers highlight the increasing trend.Data show that the TTP engaged in at least 600 attacks against, or clashes with, security forces in the past year alone. Its activity in 2025 so far already exceeds that seen in all of 2024.The Centre for Research and Security Studies, an Islamabad-based think tank, put the number of deaths of Pakistan's security personnel at more than 2,400 in the first three quarters of this year, which is on track to become the deadliest year in a decade.The recent strikes by Pakistan mark a departure from its often ambivalent or covert stance toward Taliban activities.By crossing into Afghan soil to target militants, Pakistan appears intent on sending a clear warning: any future terrorist operations originating from Afghanistan targeting Pakistan will provoke direct retaliatory action.This approach seeks to establish a new baseline in Pakistan-Taliban relations — a 'new normal' where Pakistan asserts its sovereignty and security interests proactively and visibly.But analysts are perplexed over Pakistan's ultimate goal with this new hardline approach.Are the strikes meant to push the Afghan Taliban into action against the TTP? or is there a bigger plan?After the weekend clashes, Pakistan - for the first time - also questioned the legitimacy of the Taliban government, even though Islamabad was the movement's chief patron for a quarter of a century.Pakistan demanded ""concrete and verifiable actions against these terrorist elements by the Taliban regime"".Significantly, it declared: ""We also hope that one day, the Afghan people would be emancipated, and they would be governed by a true representative government.""This was the first major hint that Pakistan might be open to the idea of throwing its support behind anti-Taliban groups if the current regime continues to ignore Pakistan's security concerns.This escalating dynamic between Pakistan and the Taliban bears remarkable similarities to the India-Pakistan situation earlier in 2025.In April, in response to a spate of terrorist attacks orchestrated by Pakistan-based groups, India launched Operation Sindoor. This was a surgical counter-terrorism campaign targeting terror camps across the Line of Control and deeper inside Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir.After the operation, Prime Minister Narendra Modi made it clear that cross-border terrorism would no longer be tolerated, signaling a shift from reactive to proactive and offensive counterterrorism measures.""Terrorism must be crushed at its roots,"" PM Modi emphasised in key speeches following the operation. He highlighted that India would no longer remain complacent or defensive but take the fight to terrorist safe havens across the border.This was a stark departure from previous policies that relied primarily on defensive postures and diplomatic protests.PM Modi's approach sought to create a deterrence framework, warning Pakistan that continued use of terror proxies would only invite more severe repercussions. The impact was significant, forcing Islamabad to recalibrate its own counterterrorism and diplomacy strategies, even if publicly denying Indian claims.The Centre stressed that India would not hesitate to undertake ""pre-emptive"" action if future terrorist activities were launched from Pakistani soil. The message to Islamabad was unequivocal: Pakistan must dismantle terror infrastructure or face decisive consequences.This tough stance surprised many, including Pakistan, which protested vehemently against what it termed India’s ""cross-border aggression"". Yet PM Modi's approach has widely been seen as a game-changer in South Asian security dynamics, raising the bar for how states respond to terrorism.Analysts now speculate that Pakistan may be adopting a similar playbook in its handling of the Taliban.For years, Pakistan's official policy towards the Taliban was one of implicit support or cautious engagement, given their ideological affinities and shared interests to some extent.However, the recent strikes suggest Pakistan is recalibrating toward a more hardline posture that prioritises national security over ideological sympathies.One key motivation behind this could be Pakistan's desire to secure its western border more effectively after years of instability and violent spillovers.With the Taliban in power, Islamabad may see the need to assert dominance and clearly demarcate boundaries that opponents must not cross, even if it means direct military action inside Afghanistan.This mirrors India's move to push back decisively against terrorism and assert territorial and security integrity.If Pakistan truly adopts a stance akin to India's Operation Sindoor doctrine, the implications for regional security could be profound.It indicates a shift from proxy or indirect conflicts toward more direct and overt military engagements aimed at deterrence. This may result in a recalibrated security architecture where Pakistan no longer tolerates Taliban aggression emanating from Afghan territory, just as India refuses to tolerate terrorism from Pakistan.However, this approach also risks escalating tensions further. The border clashes have already resulted in casualties on both sides and threaten to spiral into a wider conflict if not managed carefully.Whether Pakistan can sustain this new posture against the Taliban depends on several factors.Domestically, it will require strong military and political consensus to justify cross-border actions that risk escalating conflict. There are also challenges in controlling non-state actors within its own borders who may have sympathies with the Taliban or other militant groups.Externally, Pakistan's relationship with the Taliban is complex, given their historic ties, shared ethnic Pashtun links, and mutual geopolitical interests, including countering Indian influence.Moving toward a policy of strikes and retribution involves recalibrating these relationships and could alienate influential factions within Pakistan’s security establishment.The ongoing clashes and Pakistan’s direct strikes raise critical questions about the trajectory of Pakistan-Taliban relations and broader Afghanistan stability. Will this 'new normal' lead to a more disciplined, deterrence-based approach to cross-border militancy? Or will it trigger cyclical escalation?","Recent deadly clashes between Pakistan and the Taliban along their shared border signal a major shift in Islamabad's approach towards a group that it had hoped would become an ally. Far from becoming a partner, the Taliban has now emerged as the single-biggest threat to Pakistan's security. Pakistan appears intent on sending a clear warning: any future terrorist operations from Afghanistan targeting Pakistan will provoke direct retaliatory action.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124601085,imgsize-988950,width-400,resizemode-4/a-pakistani-tank-captured-by-taliban-fighters-during-the-recent-border-clashes-photo-credit-ap.jpg"

Fierce Border Clash Between Pakistan, Afghanistan Intensifies With Tanks, Shelling, High Casualties





Pakistan and Afghanistan agreed to a 48-hour temporary ceasefire beginning Wednesday evening, following a week of intense cross-border hostilities that left dozens dead on both sides and significantly strained already fragile bilateral ties, reported Pakistan daily Dawn.The Pakistan foreign office (FO) confirmed the development, stating that the truce was arranged “with the mutual consent of both parties” at the request of the Afghan Taliban regime.“During this period, both sides will make sincere efforts to find a positive solution to this complex but solvable issue through constructive dialogue,” the FO said, as quoted by the daily.Also read: Fierce Pakistan-Afghanistan border clash rages on; fresh visuals show intense shelling - Top developments The announcement came hours after Pakistan carried out precision strikes targeting key Taliban positions in Kandahar and Kabul, in response to attacks from Afghan territory that reportedly killed 23 Pakistani soldiers and injured 29 others, according to the military’s media wing, inter-services public relations (ISPR).Afghan Taliban government spokesperson echoed Islambad's stanmce on ceasefire but contrdicted on what might have led to it, stating: ""At request of Pakistani side, a ceasefire between the two countries will take place this evening.""

The ISPR stated that the Taliban launched coordinated attacks at four points, which were “effectively repulsed” by Pakistani forces. Around 15–20 attackers were killed, it added.The Afghan side has described the attacks as “retaliatory”, accusing Islamabad of conducting airstrikes in its territory. Tensions have worsened amid repeated Pakistani accusations that terrorist groups use Afghan soil to launch attacks inside Pakistan. Kabul denies these claims, stating that its territory is not being used for such purposes.On Monday, Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif told Geo News: “It’s a stalemate right now. You can say there are no active hostilities, but the environment is hostile… There are no ties, direct or indirect, as of today.” He also warned that hostilities could resume “at any time.”","Pakistan and Afghanistan agreed to a 48-hour temporary ceasefire beginning Wednesday evening.

Pakistan has secured a $1.2 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund . IMF on Tuesday said that it has reached a staff-level agreement with the South Asian country under its ongoing loan program, paving the way for Islamabad to access $1.2 billion pending approval from the Fund's Executive Board.According to the official statement issued by the IMF, Pakistan will receive $1 billion through the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and another $200 million under the Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF), taking the total disbursements under both programs to about $3.3 billion.""The IMF team has reached a staff-level agreement with the Pakistani authorities on the second review of the 37-month Extended Arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and the first review of the 28-month arrangement under the Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF).

Pakistan-Afghanistan Clashes: Heavy Fighting Along Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Border, Taliban Posts Damaged

Poll Should countries take stronger action to secure their borders against militant attacks? Yes, strict security is necessary No, dialogue and diplomacy are better





Pakistani troops engaged in heavy fighting with Afghan Taliban fighters on Tuesday night along the Kurram district border in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The clashes came after the Taliban and militants linked to the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan , called Fitna al-Khawarij by authorities, reportedly opened fire without warning.PTV News said several Taliban posts were heavily damaged, including at least one tank, and fighters fled their positions. Later reports added that additional posts and tank positions, including Shamsadar post, were destroyed, and a senior Fitna al-Khawarij commander was killed.Earlier, Pakistan’s foreign secretary Amna Baloch briefed resident ambassadors in Islamabad, stressing “Pakistan’s legitimate security concerns and its unwavering resolve to protect its territorial integrity and national security.”Over the weekend, Taliban forces allegedly attacked Pakistani border posts, killing 23 troops. Islamabad responded, claiming more than 200 Taliban and allied militants were killed. Kabul called the strike “retaliatory,” accusing Pakistan of air raids inside Afghan territory last week, which Pakistan has denied.","Pakistan-Afghanistan Clashes: Heavy Fighting Along Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Border, Taliban Posts Damaged.

Retaliatory Strike by Afghan Forces Kills 15 Pakistani Soldiers; Qatar Calls for Dialogue





NEW DELHI: Former Indian diplomat KP Fabian on Sunday described Pakistan’s foreign policy as a “failure” following its recent confrontation with Afghanistan, where Islamabad has been accused of carrying out strikes on Afghan territory.Speaking to news agency ANI, Fabian said Pakistan had acted as an aggressor and “played its hand badly,” resulting in deteriorating relations with Kabul.“This has happened when, maybe coincidentally, the Afghanistan Emirate foreign minister is in Delhi,” Fabian said, as per ANI.“The bad relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan cannot entirely be explained on the basis of the Durand Line. I think Pakistan played its hand badly, probably was overbearing. The proud Afghans resisted, and now the relationship is very bad,” he said.Fabian noted that Pakistan had carried out strikes on Kabul, prompting Afghanistan’s retaliation.“On the whole, Pakistani policy has been, more or less, a failure... It is abundantly clear that Afghanistan is keen on developing relations with India, which is the case with India too, and Pakistan is naturally upset,” he added.The Afghan ministry of defence has recently said that the armed forces of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan conducted “successful retaliatory operations” against Pakistani military positions along the Durand Line late Saturday night.In a statement cited by ANI, the ministry said the strikes were “in response to repeated violations of Afghanistan’s sovereignty by the Pakistani military and airstrikes on its territory.”According to news agency Associated Press (AP), Afghanistan claimed on Sunday that its forces had killed 58 Pakistani soldiers and captured 25 military posts in overnight operations along the border.Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said Afghan forces were in control of the “official borders and de facto lines,” though Pakistan has not confirmed any casualties.Both the Torkham and Chaman border crossings remained closed on Sunday following the escalation. Pakistan, for its part, accused Afghan authorities of harbouring militants of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a charge Kabul has denied.Tensions between the two countries have worsened in recent months, with frequent border skirmishes and airstrikes deepening distrust. Saudi Arabia has called for “restraint and dialogue” to prevent further escalation in the region.","Former Indian diplomat KP Fabian on Sunday described Pakistan’s foreign policy as a “failure” following its recent confrontation with Afghanistan.

PESHAWAR: Seven policemen were killed and 13 others injured in a terrorist attack at a police training centre in Pakistan 's restive Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, the army said on Saturday.The attack took place late Friday night when seven to eight terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) launched a coordinated assault using heavy weapons on the Dera Ismail Khan Police Training Centre in the DI Khan district, near the South Waziristan border.On the intervening night of October 10-11, terrorists attempted to breach the perimeter of the police training school by ramming an explosives-laden truck into its main gate, triggering a massive explosion, the army said in a statement.While one policeman was killed in the attack, six others died in the retaliatory exchange of fire between the security personnel and the terrorists.After the intense five-hour engagement, six terrorists were also eliminated, the army said.During the exchange of fire, the militants continued throwing hand grenades.A mosque inside the institute complex was targeted by the terrorists.

The Big Picture



What’s Happening



Why It Matters



The Background



What’s Next







It’s the kind of video you’d expect to stumble upon on a jihadist message board in 2004: three hooded hostages kneeling, their captors standing grim-faced behind them, Kalashnikovs poised like punctuation marks. The lighting is harsh, the script familiar — a finger jabs at the air, a threat is uttered, and you brace for the worst.Except this time, the script flips. The hood comes off, and instead of a terrified prisoner, there’s an American influencer with a movie-star grin and a cheery “Welcome to Afghanistan!” The scene cuts to pull-ups on tank barrels, selfies with Kalashnikovs, and tourists laughing in the shadow of a regime that once banned music and stoned women.This is not satire. It’s marketing — part of a growing trend in which a new breed of social-media provocateurs, dubbed “Talibros,” are repackaging Taliban-controlled Afghanistan as the ultimate offbeat travel destination. Their content straddles the line between shock humour and soft propaganda, turning a war-scarred theocracy into a backdrop for clout-chasing, contrarianism, and a very modern kind of ideological theatre.The Talibros are not journalists, historians, or analysts. They’re content creators — mostly men, mostly Western — who package Taliban-ruled Afghanistan as the ultimate contrarian experience. Their message is simple and seductive: everything you’ve heard is wrong.They insist that women aren’t oppressed because they’re visible in marketplaces. That Taliban fighters aren’t dangerous because they crack jokes on camera. That a country that banned female education past the age of twelve and removed women’s books from universities is simply “misunderstood.”The aesthetic is part Vice gonzo reporting, part frat-house vlog, and part soft-focus propaganda. And it works — because it flatters an audience exhausted by “mainstream narratives” and eager to believe that they, not the gullible masses, are finally seeing the “real story.”Aryubi’s video was just the start. Addison Pierre Maalouf, better known as Arab to his two million YouTube subscribers, shot to fame touring Afghanistan’s “women’s markets.” He mugs for the camera, pretending astonishment that women speak in public, while an overlay of a Western news headline flashes on screen: Taliban Bans Women from Speaking. The implication: media hysteria. The reality: women remain subject to draconian restrictions, their public presence tightly policed and their educational prospects gutted.Meanwhile, Kurt Caz, a South African travel vlogger, shifted from filming dangerous neighbourhoods in Venezuela and Kenya to walking the streets of Frankfurt with far-right activists, complaining about “illegal migrants” and dubbing the city “Crackfurt.” The pivot is revealing: the Talibros no longer just document “risk” abroad — they now weaponise it at home, warning young Western men that their cities will collapse too.It would be comforting to dismiss this as fringe stupidity — testosterone tourism with a side of irony. But the Talibros are playing a bigger game. They’ve mastered the algorithmic dark arts of the attention economy: weaponise distrust, monetise outrage, and flatten complexity into punchy, meme-able contrarianism.They know that traditional media is suffering a credibility crisis. Only a quarter of under-50s say they trust the news to report “fully and fairly.” Into that vacuum step the self-anointed truth-tellers, promising real insight while building parasocial empires on YouTube and Patreon. Once viewers stop trusting journalists, they don’t turn sceptical — they turn loyal. Loyal to them.The irony is that the Talibros aren’t selling reality at all. They’re selling a feeling — the dopamine hit of believing you’re in on a secret, that you’re smarter than the “sheeple.” And the deeper that feeling runs, the harder it is to shake.Travel content has always flirted with danger — explorers trekking through war zones, vloggers sneaking into North Korea, influencers chasing adrenaline in “forbidden” places. But the Talibros have twisted that instinct into something more ideological.They’re heirs to a lineage of online provocateurs — Andrew Tate, Sneako, and the wider “red pill” sphere — who discovered that contrarianism isn’t just viral, it’s profitable. And they’ve applied that playbook to geopolitics: destabilise consensus, cherry-pick anecdotes, mock expertise, and present yourself as the only reliable narrator.Political economist William Davies captured this shift in Nervous States: when objective truth collapses, intuition becomes king. Facts don’t matter; vibes do. And nobody manipulates vibes better than a charismatic man with a GoPro, a grievance, and a Taliban escort.The Talibros are unlikely to fade — if anything, they’re a preview of the future. As platforms reward outrage over nuance and audiences grow hungrier for “unfiltered” content, the algorithm will keep boosting their blend of irony and ideology. Mainstream influencers like the Nelk Boys and Jake Paul, once prank-peddlers, are already edging into similar territory.The danger isn’t that audiences will start idolising the Taliban. It’s subtler — and more corrosive. It’s that they’ll stop believing anyone but the provocateurs. That truth will become just another aesthetic choice. That everything — beheadings, misogyny, religious extremism — will be reduced to content.And once that happens, the Talibros won’t just be influencers with a gimmick. They’ll be architects of a new kind of ignorance — one that laughs as it rewrites history, monetises trauma, and sells a war-torn nation as the latest backdrop for a YouTube thumbnail.","A new breed of social-media provocateurs, dubbed ‘Talibros,’ are repackaging Taliban-controlled Afghanistan as the ultimate offbeat travel destination.

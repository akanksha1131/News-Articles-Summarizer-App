Who’s on Trump’s ‘Christmas naughty list’? President says it’s 'long'; internet starts guessing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/whos-on-trumps-christmas-naughty-list-president-says-its-long-internet-starts-guessing/articleshow/125824349.cms,"Trump's Speech At National Christmas Tree Lighting Has MAGA Camp Saying The Same Thing





US President Donald Trump dodged a question about his “naughty list,” saying it's a long list and warning that naming names could “start aproblem out there in the world.”When the reporter asked, ""Who is on your naughty list, Trump jokingly replied that he had a “long list” before bragging about the United States being “the hottest country in the world. ” He added, “Ooooo… It’s a LONG list! I'd better not tell you, or it’ll cause a problem out there in the world. We've got a pretty big naughty list, but our country is doing well, we'e the hottest country anywhere in the world right, and a year ago we were a dead country,” Trump said.Several users on internet guessing the name for the list but the most common name came was ""Adam Schiff.""Earlier, the White House has launched a new web page called ‘Offender Hall of Shame’, to expose what they call ‘false and misleading stories’.Story links, news outlet names and information about the journalists who wrote the articles are all detailed on the web portal.Each story is categorised by ‘misrepresentation’, ‘omission of context’, ‘bias’, ‘malpractice’, ‘mischaracterisation’, ‘lie’, ‘false claim’ and even ‘left-wing lunacy’.On Sunday, Trump became the first president in US history to host the Kennedy Center Honors, amid turmoil within the performing arts centre after he removed the president and much of the governing body and installed himself as chairman.Since returning to office in January, Trump had made the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, which is named after a Democratic predecessor, a touchstone in a broader attack against what he had lambasted as “woke” anti-American culture. Trump said in August that he had agreed to host the show.At a State Department dinner for the honorees on Saturday, he said he was doing so “at the request of a certain television network.” He predicted that the broadcast, scheduled to air Dec. 23 on CBS and Paramount+, would have its best ratings ever.“It’s going to be something that I believe, and I’m going to make a prediction: This will be the highest-rated show that they’ve ever done and they’ve gotten some pretty good ratings, but there’s nothing like what’s going to happen” on Sunday night, Trump said.He assumed the role that in the past had been held by journalists such as Walter Cronkite and Stephen Colbert, as well as comedians. Before him, presidents watched the show alongside the honorees. Trump skipped the honours altogether during his first term. Since 1978, the honours have recognised stars for their influence on American culture and the arts.This year’s class included Sylvester Stallone for his Rocky and Rambo films, Kiss for its flashy, cartoonish makeup and onstage pyrotechnics, Gloria Gaynor for her feminist anthem I Will Survive, country music superstar George Strait and Tony Award-winning actor Michael Crawford.Stallone said being honoured at the ceremony was like being in the “eye of a hurricane.” The action star stated ""This is an amazing event."" “But you’re caught up in the middle of it. It’s hard to take it in until the next day. ..: but I’m incredibly humbled by it,"" he added.Crawford said it was “humbling, especially at the end of a career.”Gaynor said it “feels like a dream” to be honoured. “To be recognized in this way is the pinnacle,” she said on the red carpet.","US President Donald Trump dodged a question about his “naughty list,” saying it’s a long list and warning that naming names could “start aproblem out there in the world” On Sunday, Trump became the first president in US history to host the Kennedy Center Honors, amid turmoil within the performing arts centre.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125824463,imgsize-44420,width-400,resizemode-4/us-president-donald-trump.jpg"

US President Donald Trump on Saturday mocked late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel and called him ""horrible"" while presenting the 2025 Kennedy Center Honours honourees with their medals at the Oval Office.“We have never had a president hosting the awards before. This is the first,” Trump said while addressing reporters, as per Deadline. “I’m sure they’ll give me great reviews, right? You know, they’ll say he was horrible. He was terrible. It was a horrible situation. No, we’ll do fine.”He then compared himself with previous hosts, saying, “I watched some of the people that host. Jimmy Kimmel was horrible, and some of these people. If I can’t beat out Jimmy Kimmel in terms of talent, then I don’t think I should be president.”Trump, who appointed himself chairman of the Kennedy Center in February, said in August that he was “about 98 percent involved” in selecting the honourees. This year’s recipients are Sylvester Stallone , George Strait , KISS, Gloria Gaynor and Michael Crawford.The remarks came amid an ongoing feud between Trump and Kimmel, which escalated when Jimmy Kimmel Live! was suspended for six days in September over comments the host made following Charlie Kirk’s death.During a visit to the United Kingdom, Trump said Kimmel was “fired for lack of talent.”Last month, on Truth Social, he called the host a “man with NO TALENT and VERY POOR TELEVISION RATINGS” and wrote, “Get the bum off the air!!!”Kimmel later addressed the post, saying that his wife told him about Trump’s social media message when he woke up. “I’m the bum. I’m the bum. And he posted this, I think this is interesting, at 12:49 a.m., 11 minutes after the show ended on the East Coast, which is nice,” he teased.","US President Donald Trump mocked late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel and called him ""horrible"" He was presenting the 2025 Kennedy Center Honours honourees with their medals at the Oval Office.

Hamas Celebrates As Israel-Backed Militia Leader Yasser Abu Shabab Is Killed In Gaza Clash

Won't quit politics if I get a pardon: Netanyahu





JERUSALEM: Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu said the second phase of a US plan to end the war in Gaza was close, but cautioned several key issues still needed to be resolved, including whether a multinational security force would be deployed in the Gaza strip.Netanyahu, speaking to reporters alongside German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, said that he would hold talks with US President Donald Trump at the end of the month on how to ensure the plan's second phase was achieved.The prime minister's office in Nov said that Trump had invited Netanyahu to the White House ""in the near future"".A Hamas member said Sunday the group is ready to discuss ""freezing or storing"" its arsenal of weapons as part of its ceasefire with Israel, offering a possible formula to resolve one of the thorniest issues in the agreement. Bassem Naim, a member of Hamas' decision-making political bureau, said, ""We are open to have a comprehensive approach in order to avoid further escalations or clashes.""A ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is entering its second month, although both sides have accused each other of violating the truce agreement. Netanyahu said that it was important to ensure Hamas not only upholds the ceasefire but also follows through on ""their commitment"" to the plan to disarm and for Gaza to be demilitarised.According to the plan, Israel is to pull back further in the second phase as a transitional authority is established and a multinational security force is deployed, Hamas is disarmed, and reconstruction begins.A multinational coordination centre has been established in Israel, but there are no deadlines in the plan and officials involved say that efforts to advance it have stalled. ""What will be the timeline? What are the forces that are coming in? Will we have international forces? If not, what are the alternatives? These are all topics that are being discussed,"" Netanyahu said.Merz said that Germany was willing to help rebuild Gaza but would wait for Netanyahu's meeting with Trump, and for clarity on what Washington was prepared to do, before Berlin decides what it would contribute but that phase two ""must come now"".Netanyahu said on Sunday that he would not retire from politics if he receives a pardon from the president in years-long graft trial.","Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu says the second phase of a US plan to end the war in Gaza was close.

Filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola's watch sold for $11 million.

By Jacob Bernstein





Last March, the filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola said he was nearly broke after spending millions of dollars of his own money to finance the film ""Megalopolis."" In Oct, he said in an interview with the New York Times that to ""keep the ship afloat"" he was selling several of his watches through Phillips, a leading auction house.On Saturday, during a frenzied bidding war on Park Avenue, an F.P.Journe timepiece from his collection sold for nearly $11 million. It was the sixth-most-expensive watch to ever be sold at auction. And it is the only watch on that list that was not manufactured by Patek Philippe or Rolex. Coppola designed the watch in 2014 as a collaboration with F.P. Journe, a Swiss watch company whose horological marvels are so expensive that they make Rolex look like Swatch.Called the FFC, the watch sold on Saturday has an openwork design, which means its inner workings are on display. (The style is referred to as a skeleton dial.) In the center of the face is a gloved hand with fingers that disappear and reappear in various configurations depending on the hour.F.P. Journe was founded in 1999 by Francois-Paul Journe. Today, it has a dozen stores around the world in cities such as New York, London, Dubai, Tokyo and Paris.It produces and sells around 900 watches a year. And watch geeks are notoriously nasty about the merits of the company's timepieces. Just a handful of the FFC watches, which retail for around $1 million, were ever made.In 2021, a prototype sold for close to $5 million at Only Watch, a biennial charity auction held in Geneva and sponsored by Prince Albert II of Monaco. Going into this week's sale, Paul Boutros, the deputy chairman and head of Phillips Watches for North America, professed to have little idea what Coppola's watch might fetch.After bidding topped out at $9 million (the final price of $10.755 million includes auction fees), there was a mix of shock and resignation among high-end watch industry dealers. ""It's an extraordinary price, but the Journe market is on fire,"" said Andrew Shear, a dealer who regularly sells watches that fetch six figures.Jacek Kozubek, who runs the site Tropical Watch, said many high-end watches appeal to men who want to look like superheroes. Journe timepieces, in his estimation, are more akin to watches for real-life Marvel villains.Eric Wind, a rival of Kozubek's on the secondary market, currently has two Journes available on his site. ""The worst of the worst is trying to buy them,"" he said. ""I never would have predicted these would be the ultimate catnip for watch enthusiasts,"" he added, ""but they're definitely the hottest watches today."". The person who bought Coppola's watch was anonymous, meaning the motivation for the purchase is unknown. NYT","Francis Ford Coppola's F.P.Journe watch sells for nearly $11 million.

Rewire impulses?

Can a law rewire those impulses?

'It's not our choice'

'The horse has already bolted'





MELBOURNE: Darcey Pritchard, 15, deleted Snapchat off her phone about a year ago when she felt sucked in by its algorithm.Her friend Luca Hagop, also 15, recently spent more than 34 hours on Instagram in one week, sharing pet videos and other reels ""so random, they're funny because they're so unfunny.""Amelie Tomlinson, 14, keeps up with her friends on Snapchat, and until recently, had almost no one's phone number.Her friend Jasmine Bentley, 15, is not allowed on any social media but dreams of being a content creator.The two sets of friends, living in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne, Australia, offer a small window into the wildly different relationships today's teens have with social media. But they are united on one front: They do not think a new Australian law that bars children under 16 from having social media accounts, which takes effect Wednesday, will change their lives much.Australia passed the law a year ago, setting itself up to be a test case for what many parents say feels like this generation's Sisyphean task -- shielding children from the risks associated with social media until they are capable of navigating it responsibly.But these teenagers, born around the same time that Instagram and Snapchat were first released, are digital natives. Most know how to use VPNs, which may help them evade the ban.Many fudged their ages when they first signed up, to get around the minimum age of 13 for many social media services. Others have used their parents' information to get accounts, or have older siblings whose identities they can co-opt.More than anything, social media is just too deeply embedded into their lives.""It's how we communicate,"" Amelie said.Darcey said some of her friends had been talking about migrating to new apps. ""You're not going to stop these people,"" she said.In recent years, parents around the world have grappled with increasing alarm about social media's detriments to mental health, potential to enable online bullying and effects on developing brains.Australia was one of the first countries to pass a nationwide law to address those concerns. Last December, it set 16 as the minimum age for social media accounts, meaning hundreds of thousands of younger children would lose theirs. Other nations, like Malaysia, have followed suit with similar plans.Australia is putting the onus on the social media companies to keep younger children off their platforms and will not penalize parents or children who violate the law. Officials, including Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, have tried to tamp down expectations that the law will be an overnight fix.They say they are supporting parents who feel powerless against the lure of social media and peer pressure among teens. Anika Wells, the minister for communications, described an almost idyllic new reality with children awash in time for sports, baking or learning a new language.But it will be far from that simple. The lives and friendships of many 13- to 15-year-olds are enmeshed with social media -- even if the children are not on it themselves.For instance, when Darcey and her friends were playing an online guessing game, many of the clues were memes everyone else had seen on Instagram. When Amelie and a friend got to school 15 minutes before the first bell, they made four TikTok videos. When Jasmine puts on makeup, she will record herself, even though she is not on social media. And when Luca's mother died a few years ago, he found it helpful to type out his feelings on an anonymous server on Discord.Currently, 10 social media services are covered by the ban: Facebook, Instagram, Kick, Reddit, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, Twitch, X and YouTube. The companies have said that they do not believe a blanket ban is the best way to keep children safe, but that they will nevertheless deactivate accounts of children under 16.""They're ripping away something that has grown on us and become more part of our lives every day,"" Jasmine said.Two popular apps in Australia in the weeks leading up to the law were ""Yope,"" a photo sharing app targeting Generation Z, and ""lemon8,"" a TikTok alternative owned by the same parent company, ByteDance, portending a potential game of Whac-a-Mole with regulators.Luca jokes that Darcey lives under a ""1984"" regime when it comes to social media and phones, a nod to the all-controlling government in George Orwell's novel.Her parents have set daily time limits on apps for her and her two younger siblings -- for Darcey, five minutes on YouTube, 30 minutes for WhatsApp, 10 minutes on Spotify -- and ""downtime"" overnight.It is a careful equilibrium reached after many family discussions and a few charged, tearful fights. But it also means that after school on a recent afternoon, she spent hours talking to her father about her German homework, helping cook dinner and watching ""The Simpsons"" with her brothers, while her phone sat untouched in the designated spot on the kitchen counter. And when she found herself mindlessly scrolling on Snapchat, she herself decided to get off the app.Caroline and Joel Pritchard, Darcey's parents, said it seemed like a lonely uphill battle to restrict their children's phone usage.""It almost will feel like a bit of weight off our shoulders for the government to step in and go, hey, it's just banned,"" Joel Pritchard said. ""We can now turn around and say, 'Hey, it's not our choice.'""Darcey, who has been talking and thinking about social media's effects on her peers through her involvement in a youth-driven initiative called Project Rockit, said that limiting teenagers' use was only delaying the problem, and letting companies off the hook from making their platforms free of potentially harmful content.""It shouldn't be the user's fault,"" she said. ""The social media companies really need to take a bit more responsibility.""Luca, her friend since primary school, has always had free rein over his internet and phone use. He found a creative game building community on Discord -- which will not be affected by the law -- and enjoys science videos on YouTube.Instagram, he said, is just an easy pastime, which takes less effort than, say, setting up a board game. Even though at times he has felt ""trapped"" by its algorithm, he thinks he can outsmart it by shutting down the app when he sees videos he does not like.""Today I liked a few dog reels in a row, and then I got only dog videos for a few hours,"" he said on a recent afternoon, when he had stayed home sick from school.His father, Adrian Hagop, said he had always trusted that Luca and his older brother were mature and responsible enough to make their own decisions, and believed they should learn to deal with problems they may encounter online, rather than coddle them from unknown perils.His approach is to let them have those experiences and come to him to talk about it afterward if need be. Even after the ban, if Luca wants to be on social media, Hagop said he would help him get an account.""Both my kids are fairly skeptical, so I kind of trust them,"" he said. ""I think it depends on the kid.""When Amelie was trying to persuade her parents to allow her on TikTok, she pleaded her case in a five-page, single-spaced letter about not wanting to feel left out.Her mother, Catherine Best, said she felt that parents had lost control years ago. When Amelie had just started primary school, Best deleted YouTube off her daughter's school-required iPad because she was watching toy unboxing videos nonstop. The school insisted on reinstalling it because teachers used educational videos on YouTube in class.""That was really the gateway,"" said Best, who said the law was too little, too late. ""I feel like the horse has already bolted.""Amelie said that, like many of her friends, she had two TikTok accounts, both set to private: one for just close friends and the other for a wider group. The account with her friends has her age set to 19, so she was not worried about losing access.But she was exchanging phone numbers with friends for the first time in anticipation of losing her Snapchat account. This month, the app prompted her to verify her age -- set to 16 -- with a selfie, and it approved her as being old enough to continue using her account, she said.Amelie said she recognized how much she reached for her phone. Her screen time ""goes nuts"" on school holidays.""It's just an instinct to pick up my phone,"" she said, ""which I don't like.""Jasmine, a friend of Amelie's since the beginning of high school, said she felt like her generation's social media usage was misunderstood by grown-ups. Even though she is not on social media, her group of friends often film TikTok videos when they hang out.""There's a lot of creative freedom,"" she said. ""We're doing other things than just watching videos and scrolling, there's a lot more to it.""Her father, Craig Bentley, said even if Jasmine was inevitably exposed to social media, he felt better knowing she would always be with a friend, rather than scrolling on her own.Bentley, a high school teacher, said he had witnessed young minds shift as smartphones grew more pervasive, attention spans growing shorter and self-regulation dwindling.As for the law, he said, any effect would be for the better. At a minimum, he said, it will send the message that Australia will not stand for these apps taking control of a generation.""I hope there's a revolution against it and we all just decide it's not OK,"" he said.","Australian law bans children under 16 from having social media accounts. Many 13- to 15-year-olds are enmeshed with social media, even if the children are not on it themselves.

FBI weighs Candace Owens’ explosive claim that France paid for a hit squad to kill her





Candace Owens’ latest accusation has set off a storm bigger than any of her past controversies, pulling in foreign governments, media figures, and now the FBI. The conservative commentator recently claimed that French President Emmanuel Macron authorized an assassination plot targeting her, allegedly involving a team from France’s National Gendarmerie Intervention Group, which she insists includes “one Israeli. ”The accusation was widely mocked online, but it landed on the desk of FBI Director Kash Patel, who was confronted with the claims during a tense interview on The Megyn Kelly Show. While Patel did not validate the theory, his response opened the door to a new level of scrutiny over Owens’ explosive allegations.Last month, Owens posted her original accusation on X, writing that a “high-ranking employee of the French Government” warned her of an assassination order. She claimed, “the Macrons have executed upon and paid for my assassination,” adding that the plot was already “formalized.”She further alleged the hit squad includes “one Israeli” and linked it to the murder of Turning Point USA’s Charlie Kirk, insisting, “The head of state of France apparently wants us both dead.”On Kelly’s show, Patel was asked point-blank whether he believed a foreign government targeted Owens.Patel didn’t support her claim, but he didn’t dismiss it either: “Any American that receives a death threat from overseas or anywhere in America is going to be fully investigated. So we’re not going to turn our eye away from that investigation or any others.”When pressed again, he clarified, “So fa-, we are just looking at everything that comes in… If someone feels that their life is being threatened, we are of course looking at it.”What Patel didn’t provide was evidence. He admitted the FBI has “zero” credible reason to believe foreign governments were behind Kirk’s assassination and offered nothing to support Owens’ theory. Owens, who has repeatedly suggested conspiracies involving France, Israel, and even Kirk’s associates, now finds herself challenged by those she accused, who invited her to a public event to present proof. She accepted, until she didn’t.Whether Owens’ claim is a genuine tip or her most sensational conspiracy yet, Patel’s refusal to outright dismiss it ensures the story won’t fade anytime soon.Also Read: “Provide a description…”: Candace Owens challenges Tim Pool’s shooting claim, demands proof after alleged attack","Conservative commentator Candace Owens claimed French President Emmanuel Macron authorized an assassination plot against her.

Planning your year around UAE holidays





Local authorities may add extra holidays

Public holidays are not carried forward if they fall on weekends or overlap with another holiday

Islamic holidays depend on moon sightings, so slight adjustments are possible





Residents of the UAE have much to look forward to in 2026, with several public holidays promising opportunities for long weekends and family time. From Eid celebrations to the National Day, a mix of fixed Gregorian dates and Islamic lunar holidays will shape the holiday calendar. Here is a detailed guide to all predicted public holidays, how they are determined, and tips to plan your time off.UAE public holidays are a combination of fixed Gregorian dates and Islamic lunar calendar dates. Gregorian holidays, such as New Year’s Day and National Day, occur on the same date each year. Islamic holidays, including Eid Al Fitr, Eid Al Adha, Islamic New Year, and Prophet Muhammad’s Birthday (PBUH), shift each year based on moon sightings.The UAE Public Holiday Law, established in April 2024 and implemented from January 2025, allows certain holidays to be shifted to the start or end of the week to create long weekends, except for Eid holidays. Cabinet Resolution No. 27 of 2024 also permits local governments to declare additional holidays for special occasions.Holidays that fall on weekends or coincide with another public holiday are not carried forward, but 2026 predictions indicate no overlap between Islamic holidays and Gregorian holidays.Residents in the UAE can expect at least 12 public holidays in 2026. While final dates depend on moon sightings and government announcements, current predictions give a clear picture of the likely schedule:Transferable holidays: Islamic holidays such as Eid Al Fitr and Eid Al Adha are not transferable. Other holidays, including the Islamic New Year, Prophet’s Birthday, and National Day, may be moved to create long weekends based on Cabinet resolutions.2026 promises several opportunities for extended breaks:Residents are advised to plan ahead, as Islamic holidays depend on moon sightings, which may adjust official dates.Public and private schools in the UAE align their breaks with national holidays, though exact dates differ by curriculum and school authority:This schedule helps families coordinate holidays and make the most of predicted long weekends.Understanding the mix of fixed and lunar based holidays allows residents to strategically plan annual leave. For example, taking just a few days off around Eid or National Day can maximize time away from work. While the UAE government confirms official dates closer to each holiday, these predictions serve as a reliable guide for 2026.Residents should note:With this guide, UAE residents can look forward to a year of well timed breaks, long weekends, and ample family and leisure time.","UAE residents in 2026 can enjoy 12 public holidays, including Eid, National Day, and school breaks.

Who is Oscar Solorzano? Twice deported illegal immigrant charged in Charlotte light rail stabbing case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/oscar-solorzano-twice-deported-charged-in-charlotte-light-rail-stabbing-case/articleshow/125812245.cms,"



An illegal immigrant, who is identified as Oscar Gerardo Solorzano-Garcia, was taken into custody in connection with a stabbing on a light rail in Charlotte, North Carolina.While investigating the case, the police discovered that the 33-year-old suspect was actually deported twice back to his country.Solorzano-Garcia was issued a final deportation order in 2018 and was removed from the United States on March 9 of that year, DHS said. He was arrested crossing the border illegally again in 2021 and removed a second time. DHS said he apparently re-entered the US a third time at an unknown date and location.DHS Secretary Kristi Noem condemned the alleged stabbing, saying the incident “should have never happened.“This heinous stabbing by this twice removed illegal alien should have NEVER happened. ICE lodged an arrest detainer to ensure Oscar Gerardo Solorzano-Garcia is not released back into North Carolina neighborhoods. Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee the county will honor the detainer since they have a history of not cooperating with ICE,” said Secretary Noem in a press statement released by DHS.“Under President Trump, ICE is being unleashed to ensure public safety for all Americans. Make no mistake: We will not rest until every depraved criminal illegal alien is removed from our communities,"" she added.What are the charges against him?Oscar Gerardo Solorzano-Garcia has been charged with first-degree murder after allegedly attacking a male passenger with a large knife, according to DHS.

‘Whole thing just disgusts...’: CEO Brian Thompson’s colleague slams fans of his killer Luigi Mangione,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/whole-thing-just-disgusts-ceo-brian-thompsons-colleague-slams-fans-of-his-killer-luigi-mangione/articleshow/125809962.cms,"Luigi Mangione Gets 200+ Letters A Day; Some Too Explicit To Read Out Loud





A former colleague of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson , who was killed by Luigi Mangione , is not happy with the fans who give attention to the shooter.It has been one year since the executive was shot dead in Manhattan, but the case of Mangione is still ongoing.“It was the Luigi show,” said Terrie Martin, an independent Medicare broker from Texas who met Thompson at a conference months before his death, reports the New York Post.She described how Brian was an innocent family guy: “The whole thing just disgusts me — the way it was handled, the way it was portrayed, the way everybody jumped to celebrate when they weren’t even thinking this guy was a father, a husband, a boss or anything. That was just appalling.”50-year-old Thompson was fatally shot outside the Hilton Hotel in New York on December 4, 2024. The assassination was caught on camera.26-year-old Mangione managed to flee New York but was arrested after a five-day manhunt at a McDonald’s in Pennsylvania. Federal prosecutors ruled that Mangione was hostile towards the healthcare industry.Thompson's accomplice said he bore no resemblance to the “caricature” painted by Mangione’s supporters.“He really and truly wanted to know how to make it better, nuts and bolts from people who are working on the ground in the trenches. What’s beneficial, what’s lacking, how can we make it better? He was really, really set on that very sincerely. He was actually trying to make a difference. That’s what made me so sad.”She recalled Thompson’s humility: “The one thing that I noticed from the very beginning was that everyone called him BT. They didn’t call him Brian or Mr. Thompson… I’ve never seen a dynamic like that before in corporate America.”Martin also remembered an awkward moment when she realised she had been speaking to the CEO. “He just laughed. He was so gracious about it. If you had met him anywhere like in line at a grocery store or a sporting event, you would never have guessed he was a CEO. Never. He was just such a really nice, humble, everyday kinda guy.”Earlier this week, a Manhattan judge reviewed key evidence in Mangione’s murder case, including a 911 call from the Altoona McDonald’s where he was arrested days after the killing. Prosecutors played surveillance footage of a masked gunman shooting Thompson. Mangione's defence seeks to suppress evidence from his arrest, including a handgun, a magazine, and a notebook.Meanwhile, supporters gathered outside the court in costume, holding “Free Luigi” signs.","Former colleague of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson is not happy with the fans who give attention to Luigi Mangione.

A powerful magnitude-7.0 earthquake struck in a remote area near the border between Alaska and the Canadian territory of Yukon on Saturday.There was no tsunami warning, and officials said there were no immediate reports of damage or injury, AP news agency reported.The U.S. Geological Survey said it struck about 230 miles (370 kilometres) northwest of Juneau, Alaska, and 155 miles (250 kilometres) west of Whitehorse, Yukon.In Whitehorse, Royal Canadian Mounted Police Sgt. Calista MacLeod said the detachment received two 911 calls about the quake. “It definitely was felt,” MacLeod said. “There are a lot of people on social media, people felt it.”Alison Bird, a seismologist with Natural Resources Canada, said the part of Yukon most affected by the temblor is mountainous and has few people. “Mostly people have reported things falling off shelves and walls,” Bird said. “It doesn’t seem like we’ve seen anything in terms of structural damage.”The Canadian community nearest to the epicentre is Haines Junction, about 80 miles (130 kilometres) away, Bird said. The Yukon Bureau of Statistics listed its population at 1,018 for 2022. The quake was also about 56 miles (91 kilometres) from Yakutat, Alaska, which the USGS said has 662 residents.It struck at a depth of about 6 miles (10 kilometres) and was followed by multiple smaller aftershocks.","There was no tsunami warning, and officials said there were no immediate reports of damage or injury.

Biggest ever US travel ban in the works?

The United States is planning to expand the number of countries that were covered by its travel ban - and the new list may include over 30 countries.US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, on Thursday, during an interview on Fox News’ The Ingraham Angle, when asked whether President Donald Trump’s administration would increase the number to 32, she said “I won’t be specific on the number, but it’s over 30, and the president is continuing to evaluate countries. ""In June, Trump signed a proclamation banning citizens of 12 countries from entering the United States and restricting those from seven others, saying it was needed to protect against “foreign terrorists” and other security threats, Reuters reported.The bans applied to both immigrants and non-immigrants, such as tourists, students and business travellers.Noem did not specify which countries would be added to the list. “If they don’t have a stable government there, if they don’t have a country that can sustain itself and tell us who those individuals are and help us vet them, why should we allow people from that country to come here to the United States?” she said.Reuters previously reported that the Trump administration was considering banning citizens of 36 additional countries from entering the United States, according to an internal State Department cable.An expansion of the list would mark a further escalation of migration measures the administration had taken since the shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, DC, last week.Investigators said the shooting was carried out by an Afghan national who entered the US in 2021 through a resettlement programme under which Trump administration officials have argued there was insufficient vetting. Days after the shooting, Trump vowed to “permanently pause” migration from all “Third World Countries,” although he did not identify any by name or define “third-world countries.”Prior to that, officials from the Department of Homeland Security said Trump had ordered a widespread review of asylum cases approved under the administration of his predecessor, Democratic President Joe Biden, and Green Cards issued to citizens of 19 countries. Since returning to office in January, Trump has aggressively prioritised immigration enforcement, sending federal agents to major US cities and turning away asylum seekers at the US-Mexico border. His administration has frequently highlighted the deportation push, but until now it has put less emphasis on efforts to reshape legal immigration.","US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the president is 'continuing to evaluate countries' In June, President Donald Trump signed a proclamation banning citizens of 12 countries from entering the United States.

"Caribbean boat strikes: Survivors were 'waving in clear distress' after first missile hit them, say sources",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/caribbean-boat-strikes-survivors-were-waving-in-clear-distress-after-first-missile-hit-them-say-sources/articleshow/125809877.cms,"Protests In DC Against Venezuela Boat Strikes; Dozens Rally Outside White House

Survivors were in 'clear distress'

Survivors were trying to 'stay in the fight'

Trump says Pete 'didn't know what people were talking about'





Two people who survived the September 2nd US strike on an alleged drug boat in the Caribbean were seen waving before they were killed in a second follow-up strike, sources familiar with a video shown to lawmakers revealed.One source said the gestures could be interpreted as the survivors either calling for help or surrendering to avoid another strike.The operation was the first of more than 20 US attacks on suspected drug-carrying vessels under the Trump administration. The GOP leader has defended the campaign as a necessary way to curb narcotics trafficking. However, the premise remains legally questionable. The Pentagon has reported that more than 80 people have died in these strikes, including 11 in the initial September 2 attack.Members of Congress were shown video of the strikes, including the follow-up attack that killed the two survivors, during a closed-door briefing with the operation's commander, Adm. Mitch Bradley, and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine, according to CBS News.Democratic Representative Jim Himes of Connecticut described the scene as one of the most difficult things hes ever seen in his life. He said the survivors appeared “in clear distress without any means of locomotion.”Republican Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas defended the strikes. He said the survivors were “trying to flip a boat loaded with drugs bound for the United States back over so they could stay in the fight” and clarified that the strikes were “entirely lawful and needful.”US President Donald Trump hinted he would support releasing the video to the public, but denied knowledge of any order given to target survivors. “I don't know that that happened. And Pete said he did not want that — he didn't even know what people were talking about. We'll look into it. But no, I wouldn't have wanted that. Not a second strike,” he said.Trump has also said that Venezuela’s airspace should now be considered “closed” amid rising tensions.Defensed department officials have defended the operations as legal and necessary. Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell told The Washington Post that “ongoing operations to dismantle narcoterrorism and to protect the Homeland from deadly drugs have been a resounding success.”Defense secretary Pete Hegseth said the strikes were “lethal, kinetic strikes” aimed at stopping drug trafficking and destroying vessels affiliated with “Designated Terrorist Organisations.”Legal experts and lawmakers have expressed concern that targeting survivors could constitute a war crime.","Survivors seen waving before they were killed in a second follow-up strike.

US President Donald Trump on Saturday evening hosted the 2025 Kennedy Center honorees in the Oval Office for a medal-presentation ceremony.“This is a great evening, it’s a great honour,” Trump said. “And I’m delighted to welcome to the Oval Office – the world-famous, most famous office in the world, most powerful office in the world – our truly exceptional 2025 Kennedy Center honorees. ”Trump said the honorees “inspired, uplifted and unified millions and millions of Americans”, calling them “the most accomplished and renowned class of Kennedy Center honorees ever assembled”.Kennedy Center president Richard Grenell stood behind Trump as the President presented the medals. Grenell, who was appointed by Trump in February this year to head the centre, is also a special envoy to Latin America for the administration.This year's recipients are actor Sylvester Stallone , singers Gloria Gaynor and George Strait, the rock band Kiss and actor-singer Michael Crawford , Guardian reported.The medallions to the honorees were “re-designed” by Tiffany and Co, Trump said. “They have done a fantastic job, they’re wonderful people – I know them very well because they’re right next to Trump Tower, I’ve lived with them many years,” he said.Trump never visited the John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in his first term, and did not take part in its annual awards programme.But he has taken a keen interest in his second. Since taking office, he has ousted the Kennedy Center’s board of trustees and replaced them with supporters. He has promised to “fully renovate” the Kennedy Center’s infrastructure, and make it a “crown jewel” of arts and culture in the US.It was unclear how this year’s honorees were chosen, but Trump said in August when presenting the list that he had been “about 98% involved”.The Kennedy Center Honors programme and its series of tribute performances for each recipient is set to be taped on Sunday, and will be broadcast later in December.The President said in August that he would host the show, and Trump on Saturday set expectations high: “I believe – and I’m going to make a prediction: this will be the highest-rated show that they’ve ever done,” Trump said about Sunday’s event during the medal ceremony. “And they’ve gotten some pretty good ratings. But there’s nothing like what’s going to happen tomorrow night.”Presidents traditionally attend the programme, but none has ever presented the show, a fact Trump appeared aware of as well. “We never had a president hosting the awards before, this is a first. I’m sure they’ll give me great reviews, right?” Trump quipped. “No, we’ll do fine. I’ve watched some of the people that host. Jimmy Kimmel was horrible.”“If I can’t beat out Jimmy Kimmel in terms of talent, then I don’t think I should be President,” Trump added.","US President Donald Trump hosted the 2025 Kennedy Center honorees in the Oval Office for a medal-presentation ceremony.

‘Send Usha back to India’: JD Vance blasted for 'theft' claim on mass migration; netizens point to his wife’s Indian heritage,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/send-usha-back-to-india-jd-vance-blasted-for-theft-claim-on-mass-migration-netizens-point-to-his-wifes-indian-heritage/articleshow/125824105.cms,"Usha Vance Breaks the Internet: Awkward Body Language & Bare Finger Raise Eyebrows





US Vice President JD Vance has once again wandered into the political buzzsaw, declaring that “mass migration is theft of the American Dream,” a line that instantly lit up the internet, drew accusations of hypocrisy, and launched a thousand memes before breakfast.Vance set off a political fire alarm this week after declaring that mass migration is “theft of the American Dream,” a line that critics immediately labeled hypocritical — given that his wife, Usha, is the American-born daughter of Indian immigrants.Vance made the claim in a post on X, warning that immigrants were robbing U.S. workers of opportunity and alleging that any studies that say otherwise are funded by “people getting rich off the old system.”One user promptly fired back: ""That means you have to send Usha, her Indian family, and your biracial kids back to India. Let us know when buy the plane tickets. You must lead by example.""Another user said, ""I am getting sick of this. What is Usha's family doing in andhra? They need to speak up against this racist b*****d and why Usha is allowing the mockery of her ethnicity and religion. Now I am more interested in what made her marry this b*****d.A user said, ""Wait, isn’t your wife Indian from immigrant family?""It’s far from the first time Vance has gone viral for immigration talk. On a recent New York Post podcast, he said it was “totally reasonable” to prefer neighbors who share one’s race, language, or skin color, adding that a future Trump administration would try to “remove as many [undocumented migrants] as we possibly can.”And the uproar dredged up another mini-scandal: Vance’s remarks about hoping his Hindu wife will someday adopt his Christian faith. He later insisted Usha “has no plans to convert,” but the comments sparked a fresh round of side-eye online.Meanwhile, the broader immigration crackdown is accelerating. The Trump administration has ordered a sweeping freeze on immigration applications from 19 “high-risk” countries — stalling green cards, asylum claims, and citizenship requests for millions. USCIS says the move is about security after the fatal shooting of a National Guard member by an Afghan asylum seeker in Washington, DC; immigrant families call it collective punishment dressed up as policy.","US Vice President JD Vance's wife, Usha, is the American-born daughter of Indian immigrants.

As criticism mounted over President Donald Trump ’s “garbage” remark about Somali immigrants, White House border czar Tom Homan stepped in to defend him.On Sunday, Homan said that Minnesota was home to a large illegal Somali community despite local officials’ comments that the vast majority of Somalis in the US were American citizens, Reuters reported.He denied that US Immigration and Customs Enforcement had stepped up its deportation campaign in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area in response to Trump’s comments last week about Somali immigrants, whom the President called “garbage” that should be removed from the country.Homan also said ICE agents were not targeting people based on their appearance. “I’m not aware of what President Trump was thinking when he said that,” Homan told CNN’s “State of the Union” programme. “But I agree with President Trump. From day one, he has said we are concentrated on public safety threats and national security threats.”“We also know there’s a large illegal Somali community there, that there’s a large illegal alien community there,” he said, without providing evidence. “We’re going to arrest every illegal alien that we find there.”US Representative Ilhan Omar, the Minnesota Somali community’s most high-profile member and a target of Trump’s ire, on Sunday reiterated her criticism of the President’s comments on the CBS “Face the Nation” programme.“It’s completely disgusting,” Omar told the programme, echoing comments she made to Reuters earlier this week. “These are Americans that he is calling garbage, and we feel like there is an unhealthy obsession that he has on the Somali community and an unhealthy and creepy obsession that he has with me. ”About 80,000 Somalis live in Minnesota, mostly in the Twin Cities metro region. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey has said the vast majority are US citizens.Most Somalis born outside the United States came as refugees from Somalia’s brutal, decades-long civil war, which triggered an exodus of more than 1 million people starting in 1991. The United States began issuing visas to Somali refugees in 1992.Trump’s immigration crackdown has largely been met with open support or side-stepping of the issue by Republicans who control the Senate and House of Representatives.US Senator John Curtis, a Utah Republican, said on Sunday that ICE operations were leading to unnecessary fear in US communities. “I think that to the extent that ICE is not transparent, it brings this fear into a community, and we’ve got to get rid of that fear,” he told CNN.Asked to comment on Trump’s disparaging remarks about Somalis, Curtis called for a more deliberate effort to make immigrants feel welcome and to make life better in the United States: “If more of us would do that, it would matter less what an individual said.”","White House border czar Tom Homan says Minnesota is home to a large illegal Somali community.

A 25-year-old Indian man who was in the US on a student visa has been charged with defrauding elderly people in Rhode Island. Samyag Uday Doshi, who claimed to be a student of Massachusetts University, was arrested in November when he went to make a pick-up of cash from an elderly person who was misled to believe that he had to pay the amount to federal officers to avoid investigations. Doshi told the police that he was just a student and came to pick up money for the first time. But police scanned his phone and found a photo of him opening a box with gold bar in it.Investigators said Doshi then admitted that he had done at least four to five money pick ups before and was to be paid $500 for the one he was going to do when he was arrested. Police believe Doshi is not the mastermind, only a middleman as he told them that he was reporting to a man he believed was in India.The elderly victim received a voicemail on his cellular phone regarding a phony purchase and was instructed to call a telephone number provided to him to address the issue. When he called the number, scammers pretended to be a federal official and told the elderly man that he was under investigation for a myriad of charges, including money laundering. The scammers said they would help him if he paid them.Over the next three weeks, scammers directed him to make multiple cash withdrawals of tens of thousands of dollars and to then mail the funds to the state to provide them to designated courier members.The victim also tried to purchase gold bars, which alerted the owner of the store that deals with gold. He called the police and reported that an elderly man was trying to buy more than $200,000 in gold bars and was probably being scammed.The police intervened and took care of the transactions on behalf of the victim. When the victim was asked to send a check to Chicago, the investigator worked with a bank to make a fake check.

What next?





As the Donald Trump administration stopped all immigration requests from 19 countries of concern, people who were just one step away from getting their citizenship received the shock of their lives. They just received a four-sentence email informing them that their naturalization ceremony got canceled. Some were not even informed; they found out when they went to the ceremonies. Immigration officials asked which countries they were from, and then those from either of the 19 countries were told that they would not be able to take part in the naturalization process.A naturalization ceremony is the final step in the process of becoming a US citizen. It is a formal event organized by the US Citizenship and Immigration Services where a to-be citizen takes the oath of allegiance. They return their Green Card , renounce their prior allegiance to the other countries and receive a certificate of naturalization which is their official proof of US citizenship.At a ceremony in Boston's“People are devastated and they’re frightened,” Breslow told GBH News. “People were plucked out of line. They didn’t cancel the whole ceremony.”This is the situation all across the country as Trump announced an immediate immigration ban on 19 countries, including Afghanistan, Iran, Sudan, Haiti, and Somalia. These people will now be re-vetted but lawyers are also not certain about what these people should now do.Some people are carrying all documents with them in case they are stopped by immigration authorities as they go about their daily lives.Lawyers said their clients, some of whom have been living in the US since 2000, had already been vetted multiple times as they passed through a series of legal hoops before even applying for citizenship, including establishing lawful permanent residency and obtaining work authorization.","Naturalization ceremony is the final step in the process of becoming a US citizen.

At the time, Poague was a sophomore at Georgia Southwestern State University.Prosecutors said Poague killed the boy inside her boyfriend's dorm room while he was out picking up a pizza. She then texted Williams, claiming the child was not breathing. Williams rushed back to find his son unresponsive and drove him to the hospital, but doctors were unable to save him.A week after the toddler’s death, Poague was charged with murder, aggravated battery, and child cruelty. She has pleaded not guilty to all counts.“She wanted to have a child or children with Julian Williams,” prosecutor Lewis Lamb told jurors, according to CourtTV footage. “But not that child.” Poague was jealous of the attention Williams gave to his son and did not want to assume a stepmother role.

He hates me and I hate him,” she allegedly wrote.Court testimony revealed that Poague claimed the child had been eating chips before becoming unresponsive, but medical examinations did not agree with this. Doctors found evidence of blunt-force trauma to the head and torso. The emergency room physician said the injuries were inconsistent with Poague’s accounts and indicated “a direct blow.”Further claims from prosecutors included Poague searching online for terms such as “How do you get a brain bleed?” and “How can a depressed skull fracture go unnoticed?” following the toddler’s death, reports the New York Post.Poague won the Miss Donalsonville title in 2023 and competed in the National Peanut Festival pageant. She has since been stripped of her titles. She was released on $75,000 bond after her arrest, a decision that outraged Williams.“This feels like a slap in the face to me and my family,” he said. “All we want is justice for my son. Letting her out and being free is not right. She took an innocent 1-year-old’s life.”If convicted on all counts, Poague faces life without parole or the death penalty.","Romeo Angeles, 18 months, was found unresponsive in his dorm room by his mother's boyfriend.

Donald Trump Jr serves no formal role in the Donald Trump administration but his strong take on the Russia-Ukraine issue at the Doha Forum sent a chilling warning of what is going to happen inevitably -- his father President Donald Trump would abandon Ukraine if they don't make peace with Russia.Slamming Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy for prolonging the war to remain in power, Trump's eldest son said there is no way Zelenskyy would win the next election and the war is being dragged on while the corrupt elites have all moved to Monaco leaving the 'peasants' in the country to fight the war.“Because of the war, and because he’s one of the great marketers of all times, Zelenskyy became a borderline deity, especially to the left, where he could do no wrong, he was beyond reproach,” Trump Jr said.""I think he may,"" Trump Jr said when he was asked if Donald Trump would walk away from Ukraine.“What’s good about my father, and what’s unique about my father, is you don’t know what he’s going to do,” he added. “The fact that he’s not predictable … forces everyone to actually deal in an intellectually honest capacity.”""This summer I was in Monaco with my beautiful girlfriend, we were driving around the city, and on a typical day 50% of the supercars — Bugatti, Ferrari, that's all — were on Ukrainian plates.Do we really think that all this was honestly earned in Ukraine?"" Trump Jr said, explaining how the rich Ukrainians have left the country.There is no incentive to stop the war as the money trains have not stopped, Trump's son said.Americans have no appetite for writing blank checks for Ukraine or EU, Donald Trump Jr said, adding that the Russia-Ukraine conflict is not even a top 10 issue for Republicans, notwithstanding what the Republican Party says.",Donald Trump Jr slammed Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy for prolonging the war to remain in power.

How much influence does Qatar hold over US?

What comes next for Carlson and MAGA





Right-wing commentator Tucker Carlson, who has been distancing himself from core MAGA values recently, has announced he will purchase property in Qatar,This move was not very appreciated among his conservative supporters.Speaking on stage at the annual Doha Forum, Carlson shut down accusations that he is “a tool of Qatar”. He said, “I have been criticised as being a tool of Qatar... I have never taken anything from your country and do not plan to. I am, however, tomorrow buying a place in Qatar.”He said he likes the place because of its beauty and not because he runs some propaganda: “I like the city, I think it is beautiful, but also to make the statement that I am an American and a free man and I’ll be wherever I want to be.”The announcement came during an interview with Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, where much of the discussion centred around Israel, Qatar’s regional diplomacy and ongoing Middle East tensions involving Gaza as well.The news has split parts of the MAGA movement. Far-right and anti-Islam activist Laura Loomer has been one of the harshest critics of Carlson, accusing him of being “bought off by Muslims” and calling him “Tucker Qatarlson”.Loomer claimed that interviews Tucker holds with Qatar are “a paid propaganda piece,"" she said in October. She challenged Carlson to publicly release documents showing the purchase details.Qatar has spent years building influence in Washington through lobbying, investments and diplomatic partnerships. The Gulf state has become adept at cultivating high-profile Western voices to advance its interests. Some foreign-policy analysts say Carlson’s property purchase will further fuel questions about the reach of foreign governments inside American political discourse.Carlson and his team insist there is nothing improper about the trip or the interview, and that he has not received any compensation from Qatar.The row sheds light on an increasingly visible rift within right-wing politics. Carlson remains influential, but his recent positions — including interviewing Nick Fuentes and criticising Israel — have unsettled some in the MAGA base. The Qatar announcement has deepened those tensions.Recently, in a conversation with British media personality Piers Morgan, Tucker talked about how he relates more to a Pakistani cab driver than to some privileged white liberals. He and Morgan agreed that Muslim hate and Islamophobia are forced into the system. This was a very big U-turn for someone who used to follow every single principle of the GOP government.",Right-wing commentator Tucker Carlson has announced he will purchase property in Qatar.

A second Indian national has died after sustaining severe burn injuries in a house fire in Albany, United States, taking the death toll in the incident to two, authorities and the Indian mission confirmed.The deceased has been identified as Anvesh Sarapelli, who succumbed to his injuries on Saturday, a day after 24-year-old Sahaja Reddy Udumala, an Indian student, died while undergoing treatment for critical burns suffered in the same blaze on December 4.The Consulate General of India in New York expressed deep sorrow over the death of both. The mission said that it is in touch with their families and will providing all possible assistance.Udumala and Sarapelli were among four people found inside a house near Quail Street when police and firefighters responded to the fire.All victims were treated at the scene by the Albany Fire Department and emergency medical personnel before being rushed to Albany Medical Centre Hospital. Both were later shifted to the Westchester Medical Burn Centre for specialised treatment.Albany Police said that when teams reached the scene, the residence was fully engulfed in flames and several people were trapped inside.Despite rescue efforts, both Udumala and Sarapelli later “tragically” succumbed to their injuries.Sahaja Reddy Udumala, a native of Jodimetla near Uppal, Telangana, had completed her master’s degree in cyber security from the University at Albany and was working in the city.She was asleep after returning from a night shift when the fire broke out around 11.40 am (local time). Family members said the building housed several Indian students and that the fire started near her room before spreading rapidly. She suffered burns over nearly 90 per cent of her body and later died due to complete organ failure.The fire was reported to the Albany Fire Department around 11.50 am from 241 Western Avenue and soon spread to the adjoining building at 239 Western Avenue. Fire chief Joseph Gregory described the scene as a “wall of fire” and said firefighters battled strong winds and difficult weather conditions to rescue the victims.“It was a difficult operation for our firefighters. Weather conditions are tough. Wind doesn't help us at all. The members did an outstanding job getting the victims out, getting them to the hospital, and putting the fire out,” Gregory told reporters.13 residents, including several University at Albany students were displaced and a dog was also rescued from the blaze.A GoFundMe campaign has been launched by Udumala’s cousin, Rathna Gopu, to help meet funeral, memorial, and repatriation expenses.Efforts are also being coordinated by family members and the Telugu Association of North America to send her body to Hyderabad. “Arrangements are being made to bring her home,” a cousin said.The New York State Fire Investigations Unit has joined the probe. The cause of the fire is still under investigation.","A second Indian national has died after sustaining severe burn injuries in a house fire in Albany, United States.

Pak President Zardari Approves Asim Munir As The First Chief Of Defence Forces Amid Power Tensions





Pakistan’s defence ministry on Friday officially notified the appointment of Field Marshal Asim Munir as the country’s first Chief of Defence Forces (CDF).The ""president, on the advice of the prime minister, is pleased to appoint Field Marshal Asim Munir (NI) M as the chief of army staff, concurrently the chief of defence forces for a tenure of five years,” the notification read, news agency PTI reported citing Dawn.This comes a day after President Asif Ali Zardari approved his appointment on the advice of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.According to the notification issued under Article 243 of Pakistan’s Constitution and the amended Pakistan Army Act, Munir will serve concurrently as Chief of Army Staff and Chief of Defence Forces for a tenure of five years. The notification marks the most significant restructuring of Pakistan’s military command since the 1970s.The appointment follows the passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment last month, which created the new CDF post to establish a unified command structure and enable faster decision-making in critical situations.The amendment also abolished the office of the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC), which had coordinated the tri-services since 1976. The CJCSC post formally ended on November 27 following the retirement of General Sahir Shamshad Mirza.With the restructuring, operational, administrative and strategic authority of the armed forces has been consolidated into a single office headed by the CDF. The revised Article 243 provides that the president, acting on the prime minister’s advice, will appoint the army chief, who will concurrently serve as the CDF.Munir was first appointed Army Chief in November 2022 for three years. His tenure was extended to five years in 2024 after amendments to the Pakistan Army Act.He was promoted to the rank of Field Marshal days after the four-day conflict with India in May, becoming only the second officer in Pakistan’s history to hold the rank after Field Marshal Ayub Khan.Alongside Munir’s notification, the defence ministry also confirmed a two-year extension for Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Babar Sidhu. His extended tenure as Chief of the Air Staff will begin in March 2026 and continue till March 2028.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif congratulated Munir on his “historic” appointment, saying his leadership had been pivotal in guiding Pakistan’s armed forces. He also praised the air chief for his command during recent operations. defence minister Khawaja Asif and other senior leaders also extended their congratulations, according to Dawn.Information minister Attaullah Tarar said Pakistan’s defence had strengthened with the establishment of a unified command. Dismissing speculation over the delay in the notification, he said rumours circulating on social and electronic media had proven baseless.Earlier uncertainty had followed the abolition of the CJCSC post and the end of Munir’s original three-year term in late November, leading to political speculation over upcoming four-star appointments. Government officials maintained that the delay was procedural and linked to the prime minister’s travel schedule.Explaining the significance of the new post, army spokesman Lt General Ahmad Sharif Chaudhry said the CDF headquarters would improve coordination across modern, multi-domain warfare involving land, sea, air, cyber, space and intelligence operations. He added that many countries already operate under similar unified command structures.Under the amended military laws, the five-year tenure of the first COAS-plus-CDF is deemed to begin from the date of notification, effectively resetting Munir’s term. The law also allows future reappointments or extensions of up to five years, creating the legal framework for continuity in leadership.The next major step under the new structure will be the appointment of the Commander of the National Strategic Command (NSC), a four-star position responsible for strategic assets. The NSC commander will be appointed by the prime minister on the recommendation of the CDF.Meanwhile, law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said the defence ministry is finalising a new organogram for the CDF to clearly define command flows between the CDF, the service chiefs and the newly created strategic command.Politically, the 27th Constitutional Amendment has drawn mixed reactions. While the ruling coalition hailed it as a step towards efficiency and national security, opposition leaders warned that it concentrates excessive power in the military and could weaken democratic and provincial autonomy.",Pak President Zardari Approves Asim Munir As The First Chief Of Defence Forces.

Pak President Zardari Approves Asim Munir As The First Chief Of Defence Forces Amid Power Tensions

Why Imran Khan still remains a threat to Asim Munir





PTI without Imran: Still a major force





PTI was barred from contesting the 2024 general elections.

Dozens of PTI leaders were detained.

PTI-backed independents still won more seats than any other group.

Popularity that has not faded





A 2023 Gallup Pakistan survey showed 61% of Pakistanis had a “good opinion” of him -- the highest rating among all national leaders as reported by Dawn.

Arab News quoted analysts saying Khan remains ""too politically relevant to sideline.""

Televised appearances that trigger unrest





Nationwide protests

Arson and clashes

Attacks on military installations, including the Corps Commander’s residence in Lahore

Nationwide mobile shutdowns and troop deployment

Why Pak army cannot 'eliminate' Imran Khan





Key factors keeping Khan politically alive:





Victimhood narrative: Solitary confinement and restricted access cast him as a political prisoner, a powerful image in Pakistan’s grievance-driven politics.

Mobilisation without presence: PTI’s digital machinery enables mass mobilisation even without Khan physically present.

Diaspora and social media influence: Global PTI networks amplify every statement, intensifying scrutiny on Pakistan’s military.

High-risk optics: Every court appearance or televised moment risks sparking unrest.

The state vs sentiment





The jail sentence - not the silence





Constitutional shift and expanding military power





Munir's foreign outreach and US engagement





Imran's strength: Mobilisation without access





Why the military needs more than power









Is Imran Khan still a threat to Asim Munir ? The question looms over Pakistan ’s power structure. Former Prime Minister and cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan, now over two years into imprisonment, remains a potent challenge to army chief Asim Munir — whose rapid ascent and consolidation of authority have made him Pakistan’s de facto ruler.With Munir now elevated as the Pakistan's first chief of defence forces, commanding the army, navy and air force, his institutional power is at its strongest — yet the confrontation with Khan, even from behind bars, continues to shadow that authority. The two have been locked in a prolonged, deeply personal confrontation.Despite being confined, Khan has transformed from a jailed political leader into a symbolic and political counterweight to Munir’s expanding military-political dominance.Far from fading, the rivalry between the two men has only sharpened. Munir commands the state; Khan commands sentiment. And as the events of the last two years show, sentiment can be far harder to control.Imran Khan's incarceration has fuelled a narrative of persecution and martyrdom among supporters. Long spells of isolation, restrictions on visits, and recurring allegations of mistreatment have strengthened this perception, with some analysts warning that these measures risk backfiring.Imtiaz Gul, executive director of the Center for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), told Al Jazeera: ""The primary objective of blocking access and keeping Khan in solitary confinement is apparently meant to break him into (agreeing to) a compromise and neutralise the groundswell of anti-government sentiment.”Increasingly, barring visits to Khan is viewed not merely as a security decision, but as a political strategy that may harm the governing PML-N and reinforce Khan’s narrative of institutional overreach.Even without its leader on the ballot, PTI remains one of Pakistan's strongest political forces.PTI claims widespread rigging, accusing the government and military of manipulating the results, allegations echoed by several independent observers. The establishment denies all wrongdoing, but the perception of electoral injustice has only strengthened PTI’s street momentum.For perspective, Imran Khan’s PTI had won 151 seats in the 2018 elections, defeating Nawaz Sharif’s PML-N (81 seats) and PPP (54). That victory was hailed by PTI as ""the end of an era,"" breaking the decades-long political monopoly of the PML-N, PPP and the military establishment.Despite his imprisonment, Khan remains Pakistan’s most popular political figure.This enduring popularity, even at a time of complete political inability, poses a direct challenge to Munir's authority.Even brief, controlled public appearances continue to spark major political reactions.During the May 2023 unrest, Imran Khan's court appearance -- after his dramatic arrest by paramilitary forces -- showed him flashing a victory sign. The televised images spread instantly and triggered:These scenes were unprecedented not only for their scale but because the anger erupted in Punjab, the heart of Pakistan's military recruitment and administrative base.More recently, when false rumours about Khan’s death spread, PTI supporters mobilised across Islamabad, Rawalpindi, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, again forcing an immediate government response.A leader who provokes unrest without speaking remains difficult to contain.An analysis in The Diplomat warns that the army ""cannot afford to eliminate"" a leader with deep political roots in Punjab.Such an act, the report cautions, could ""unleash one that the state may not survive.""Khan is ethnically Pashtun but politically anchored in Punjab, with support stretching across Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and the diaspora. His arrest in 2023 showed that anger against the military establishment now emerges in Punjab.Eliminating him would not neutralise his influence; it would likely create a ""martyr"" of unprecedented scale.Munir commands the state apparatus. Khan commands sentiment.And in Pakistan, sentiment has repeatedly proved more enduring than power.No prime minister has survived a confrontation with the military, but no army chief has faced a jailed leader with such widespread support and political resilience.Since August 2023, Khan has faced a series of corruption and security-related cases. In January 2025, he received a 14-year sentence in a land-graft case, a verdict his supporters claim was engineered to keep him out of politics.Khan’s public statements from jail fuel the perception of political persecution. He has directly accused Munir of ""moral bankruptcy,"" and called him ""mentally unstable man"" claiming Pakistan's constitution and rule of law have collapsed under him: ""I have been kept in complete solitary confinement, locked inside a cell with no contact with a single human being for four weeks… even the basic necessities guaranteed under the jail manual have been taken away from us. ""His family members have echoed concerns about his treatment. His sister, after visiting him, said he told her they were subjecting him to ""mental torture"" and held Asim Munir responsible.The recent 27th amendment -- widely called a ""constitutional coup"" -- has entrenched military dominance further. Munir's elevation as chief of defence forces gives him command over all three services.Mahmood Khan Achakzai, head of Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-e-Pakistan, warned: ""There is no constitution in Pakistan now. No judiciary. No social contract. They have made one man into a king above all.""Months ago, Munir's increasing visibility included multiple meetings with Donald Trump. Munir even nominated Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, crediting him with easing India–Pakistan high military tensions, a move driven by a desire for US recognition. Trump later referred to him as his ""favourite field marshal.""It is often assumed that political power requires physical presence. Imran's continuing influence disproves that assumption.His followers still speak of him not as a convicted convict, but as a leader wronged. The slogans, the sense of injustice, the personal stories -- all add up to mobilisation potential. And that potential doesn’t require Khan’s freedom; it only requires people’s belief.Statements from his family amplify this -- for instance, the anguish voiced by his son over not knowing whether his father is safe in jail. Such public airing of fear and trauma becomes a magnet for sympathy and solidarity.""Not knowing whether your father is safe, injured or even alive is a form of psychological torture,"" he had said in written remarks.However, Imran Khan's sister was eventually allowed to meet the former prime minister. After the visit, she said, ""Imran Khan’s health is perfectly fine. However, he told me they are subjecting him to mental torture, and that Asim Munir is responsible for all of this.""For the military leadership under Asim Munir, the calculus is not just about brute strength, it is about legitimacy. Pakistan’s power dynamics have long relied on a veneer of neutrality: the idea that the army guards the system while politics handles politics. Overplaying that role risks shattering the illusion.From Ayub Khan and Yahya Khan to Zia-ul-Haq and Pervez Musharraf , every era of military rule reinforced the pattern: the army positioned itself not merely as a defender of borders, but as the ultimate arbiter of Pakistan's politics and identity.Each takeover was justified through narratives of chaos, corruption, or national security, allowing the establishment to retain dominance even during civilian periods. Today, under Asim Munir, this pattern continues in a more sophisticated form: instead of overt coups, power is exercised through constitutional engineering, judicial pressure, and political sidelining, most visibly in the dismantling of Imran Khan’s political career. The military’s quest is not only to command the state but to remain indispensable to its very definition.As long as Imran Khan remains a contested figure, not just legally, but symbolically, the army's claim to neutrality becomes harder to maintain.International pressure, media scrutiny, and internal dissent all rise with every heavy-handed move.Hence, the challenge for Munir may be deeper than suppressing one man, it is about managing optics, institutional trust and political fallout.",Is Imran Khan still a threat to Asim Munir? The question looms over Pakistan ’s power structure. Khan has transformed from a jailed political leader into a symbolic and political counterweight to Munir’s expanding military-political dominance.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125789753,imgsize-1800195,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-62.jpg"

Pak President Zardari Approves Asim Munir As The First Chief Of Defence Forces Amid Power Tensions





President Asif Ali Zardari on Thursday formally appointed Army Chief Field Marshal Asim Munir as Pakistan’s first Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) for a period of five years.The move follows the recent passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment on November 12, which created the post of CDF to unify command across the armed forces and streamline decision-making during critical situations.The newly created CDF replaces the abolished office of the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC), which formally ended on November 27 following the retirement of General Sahir Shamshad Mirza.President Zardari approved the recommendation submitted by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif for Munir’s appointment. A press release from the President’s office extended best wishes to Munir in his new role.The same release also announced a two-year extension in the service of Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmad Babar Sidhu, Chief of Air Staff, effective from the completion of his current tenure in March 2026.Law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said the reforms “bring constitutional oversight to defence appointments while maintaining military honour and tradition” and confirmed there were no legal or political obstacles to Munir’s appointment. He also stated that the Defence Ministry was preparing a new organogram for the CDF to reflect the changes.Field Marshal Munir, who was initially appointed as COAS in November 2022 for three years, had his tenure extended to five years in 2024.With this appointment, he assumes a historic dual role, serving simultaneously as Chief of Army Staff and the first Chief of Defence Forces, marking a significant shift in Pakistan’s military hierarchy and institutional structure.The 27th Constitutional Amendment elevates the army chief to the role of CDF with constitutional authority over all three branches of the military: army, navy and air force.It also introduces judicial reforms, including the creation of a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) to handle constitutional matters, allowing the Supreme Court to focus on civil and criminal cases.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif welcomed the amendment as a demonstration of national unity, highlighting the role of law enforcement in recent counterterrorism efforts.While the ruling coalition including PPP, PML-N, and MQM-P, supported the amendment, opposition parties criticized it as unconstitutional, warning it could concentrate excessive power in the military.PTI chairman Gohar Ali Khan described it as the “Baku Amendments,” accusing the government of undermining democracy. PPP Senator Raza Rabbani warned the changes could damage provincial autonomy and roll back powers devolved under the 18th Amendment, according to Dawn.Following Munir’s appointment, the next key step will be appointing the commander of the National Strategic Command (NSC), a four-star position previously under the CJCSC. The NSC commander will be appointed by the prime minister on the recommendation of the CDF.","President Asif Ali Zardari formally appointed Army Chief Field Marshal Asim Munir as Pakistan’s first Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) for a period of five years.

Parallel governance, ‘parchi’ systems and water mafias





Several informal systems operated during this period:

The ‘Parchi’ System: Residents, businesses and even small schools were required to obtain a stamped permission slip or parchi from PAC offices to build, renovate, operate stalls or open new ventures. What looked like a routine approval process effectively served as taxation, a tool of surveillance and a means to regulate economic activity.

Water and Tanker Control: Amid persistent water shortages across Karachi, PAC factions captured key pipeline points and operated illegal hydrants. Water was sold through tankers at inflated rates, turning a basic utility into one of the most profitable sources of revenue for the gangs. Control over water distribution also gave PAC leverage over entire neighbourhoods.

Welfare Patronage and ‘Robin Hood’ Politics: A share of illicit earnings was used to sponsor madrassas, support religious events, organise football tournaments, fund community funerals and assist poor families. This welfare strategy deepened PAC’s influence and aligned it with PPP’s political base, reinforcing the perception of gang leaders as protectors rather than mere criminals.

PPP, the Bhuttos and the contested 'protector' narrative





A factual account of the events surrounding Benazir’s return and death underscores this point:

Karsaz bombing (18 October 2007): Benazir was in an open truck surrounded by PPP volunteers, not in a car. Her protection was largely handled by party workers and an informal crowd, not gang networks.

Assassination in Rawalpindi December, 27, 2007: At the time she was targeted, she was travelling in a white Toyota Land Cruiser driven by Javed Rehman, a trained PPP driver, not Rehman Dakait. No credible evidence links the gangster to her security detail.

Post-war Lyari: Quiet streets, unresolved questions









NEW DELHI: Karachi’s Lyari has long been associated with a dual identity. To its residents, it is the “mother of Karachi” – one of the city’s oldest settlements powered by dockworkers, truck drivers, boxers and footballers. To the rest of Pakistan, especially through the 1990s and 2000s, it came to signify something very different: a “mini Brazil” of football-obsessed alleys, heavily armed gangs, and extortion rackets, long branded as Karachi’s “wild west.”It is this layered, contradictory Lyari that Aditya Dhar’s recent 'Dhurandhar' turns into cinema. The film revolves around characters that seem to be inspired by gangster Rehman Dakait, police officer Chaudhry Aslam and a shadowy military-intelligence player resembling Ilyas Kashmiri (fictionalised as Major Iqbal). Alongside Pakistani security figures, the narrative hints at a foreign intelligence angle featuring an unnamed “Indian spy chief” — a character with echoes of a former top security official who, in real life, has been involved in covert roles in regional conflicts in Pakistan. These references remain ambiguous on screen, but they mirror real allegations that have circulated for years through local press conferences, dossiers and counterclaims on both sides of the border.Reacting to the controversy around Dhurandhar and the a case file in Delhi high court, Major Mohit Sharma’s brother, Madhur Sharma, said the petition was filed due to ongoing speculation that the film was inspired by the Ashok Chakra awardee’s life without any transparency from the makers. Madhur clarified that the family is not opposed to a film based on Major Sharma, but objected to the possibility of using his story without consent. “We would be proud if a film is made on him. Even in 2021, a film was announced and we supported the producers. He has left a legacy, and it should live on,” he said. The family maintains that they are only seeking clarity and dignity for the officer: “There is no benefit the parents are looking for… If the film is based on him, just say, ‘Sorry ma’am, we didn’t inform you.’ If not, say the hype is untrue.”The Delhi high court heard the plea filed by Major Sharma’s parents seeking a review before the film’s release. While the court did not stay the December 5 release of Dhurandhar, it acknowledged the legitimacy of the family’s concerns regarding similarities to a real-life officer without consent. The court referred the matter to the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) for examination, noting the need for regulatory scrutiny before the film proceeds.Following the controversy, director Aditya Dhar issued a clarification on X addressed to the family. He wrote: “Hi, sir - our film Dhurandhar is not based on the life of braveheart Major Mohit Sharma AC(P) SM. This is an official clarification. I assure you, if we do make a biopic on Mohit sir in the future, we will do it with full consent and in complete consultation with the family, and in a way that truly honors his sacrifice for the nation and the legacy it has left for all of us. Jai Hind.”This blurred mix of fact, rumour and state narrative reflects Lyari’s history itself. For more than six decades, the neighbourhood has moved on two parallel tracks. One is a working-class community that powered Karachi’s docks, produced champion boxers and footballers, and remained a loyal base of the Pakistan People's Party ( PPP ). The other is a network of gangs and protection rackets that emerged from the hashish trade of the 1960s and later expanded into narcotics trafficking, extortion, land capture and control of water tankers.Successive governments, including PPP administrations, did not simply fight these groups; at various points they bargained with them, funded them or turned a blind eye. Leaders like Rehman Dakait, and later Uzair Baloch, acted not only as crime bosses but as political intermediaries who ran parallel governance under the banner of the Peoples’ Aman Committee (PAC), often brandishing PPP flags at their offices. As Taliban networks poured into Karachi in the 2000s and regional intelligence rivalries spilled into the city, Lyari’s gangs were no longer seen merely as enforcers protecting a vote bank — they were gradually treated as potential pieces in a wider security chessboard.With Dhurandhar reigniting attention, this story revisits how Lyari transformed from a labour colony to PPP stronghold to a battleground shaped by gang wars, state patronage, counter-terror operations and allegations of espionage. What emerges is not simply the tale of feared men, but the story of a neighbourhood where poverty, politics and competing security agendas turned everyday life into a prolonged and violent conflict.a long, violent war.Lyari is among the oldest continuously inhabited parts of Karachi and holds a foundational place in the city’s history. Long before Karachi became Pakistan’s financial hub, Lyari evolved as a working-class settlement dominated by Baloch communities who migrated from coastal and interior regions in search of livelihoods. During the 18th and 19th centuries, as the port emerged as the centre of colonial trade, Baloch labourers became indispensable to loading cargo, building roads and supporting maritime activities. This early dependence on manual workers gradually transformed Lyari into a labour colony closely interlinked with Karachi’s industrial and infrastructural growth.Despite its importance in sustaining the city’s economy, the locality remained neglected in terms of urban development. Narrow lanes, dense housing clusters, unreliable utilities and limited state services came to define its daily reality. Yet, Lyari’s social fabric remained strong: sports, community centres and local cultural traditions created a sense of belonging that distinguished it from other Karachi neighbourhoods.In politics, Lyari’s identity further crystallised with the rise of the Pakistan People's Party. Since the 1970s, the PPP’s populist messaging—centred on economic justice and empowerment of marginalised groups—found deep resonance in Lyari. During decades of shifting political power in Karachi, the locality consistently returned PPP candidates to provincial and national assemblies. This loyalty turned Lyari into the party’s most dependable urban stronghold, a constituency where electoral victories were seldom in doubt.Over time, however, this relationship between Lyari and the PPP took a complex turn. As Karachi’s security landscape deteriorated in the 1980s and 1990s, the party increasingly relied on local strongmen, community leaders and later armed groups to maintain influence and protect its vote bank. Patronage networks developed, blurring the lines between politics, street authority and organised crime. What began as a working-class community with a vibrant political identity would eventually become the focal point of Karachi’s most violent gang conflict—one in which loyalty, power and criminality became deeply entangled.The roots of the Lyari gang war go back to the 1960s, when the area emerged as a key node in the local hashish trade. According to both journalistic and academic accounts, early figures like Dad Muhammad (“Dadal”) and his brother Sheru moved into the hashish business in the mid-1960s, challenging the dominance of an older drug boss known as “Kala Nag”.Kala Nag was eventually killed in what was officially described as a police encounter, and the hashish economy fragmented into rival factions. Violence at this stage largely revolved around knives and small arms, with public killings used to send messages and enforce territorial control.In the 1990s, a more educated generation of criminals appeared. One of the most prominent was Iqbal, known locally as “Babu Dacoit”, who reportedly held a Master’s degree in physics. Operating across a wider network, he ran drugs and other rackets while remaining largely beyond the reach of the police. His later arrest, when he was already paralysed, symbolised a shift from small-scale street crime to more organised, networked operations.A major shift in Lyari’s politics and crime landscape came with the ascent of Sardar Abdul Rehman Baloch, widely known as Rehman Dakait. Born into a family already linked to smuggling networks, Rehman entered the criminal world at a young age. By the mid-1990s, he had developed a reputation for extreme violence, with local accounts even alleging that he murdered his own mother during a domestic dispute—an unverified but persistent story that reinforced his notoriety.By the early 2000s, Rehman had consolidated control over large parts of Lyari’s illicit economy, including drug trafficking, extortion and gambling rackets. Yet, he also cultivated an image as a benefactor. Oral histories, media reporting and academic studies describe how he funded small clinics, madrassas, football tournaments, neighbourhood parks and schools, using criminal proceeds to build patronage. This dual identity—provider and predator—helped him secure legitimacy among segments of the local population who felt abandoned by the state.Rehman’s rise coincided with Lyari’s continued loyalty to the PPP. As political competition intensified in Karachi, PPP leaders increasingly saw strategic value in a local armed actor who could protect the party’s dominance and mobilise votes. Political alignment, according to multiple accounts, allowed Rehman to operate with greater impunity and helped formalise gang influence under a new name: the Peoples’ Aman Committee (PAC).Formed around 2008, the PAC presented itself as a community “peace” organisation but functioned as an institutionalised version of Rehman’s operations. It opened offices, appointed local commanders, mediated disputes, collected protection money and distributed welfare. In a context of chronic state neglect, many residents began to rely on the PAC as a parallel administration, making it one of the most powerful non-state authorities Karachi had ever seen.The roots of Lyari’s modern gang war lie in an older conflict shaped by ransom kidnappings, shifting alliances and internal betrayals. In the 1980s and 1990s, parts of Lyari’s criminal economy were dominated by a figure known as Haji Lalu, with another notorious operator, Dadal, working as one of his trusted aides. Disputes over ransom money extorted from wealthy businessmen gradually fractured this relationship. The split laid the foundation for two rival blocs: one centred on Lalu and his son, Arshad Pappu, and the other aligned with Dadal’s family, including his son, Rehman Dakait.The rivalry intensified through the 1990s. Dadal’s murder—widely believed to have been carried out by a competing gang—created a vacuum that Rehman moved to fill, initially with Lalu’s support. But a later dispute over a substantial ransom sum allegedly taken behind Rehman’s back marked the end of that partnership. The fallout turned the former allies into adversaries, cementing a bitter feud between Rehman’s camp and that of Haji Lalu and Arshad Pappu.A separate event subsequently brought an important new actor onto the scene: Uzair Jan Baloch, the son of a transport businessman, Faiz Muhammad, known locally as Mama Faizu. According to both police records and local accounts, Faizu was kidnapped and killed in 2003 by men linked to Arshad Pappu. Uzair initially attempted to seek justice through legal channels but reportedly faced threats and obstruction. Sharing a common enemy in Pappu, he turned instead toward his cousin, Rehman Dakait, joining his organisation.Over the following years, the Rehman–Uzair alliance fought a sustained war against the Pappu–Lalu network. What began as a dispute over illicit profits evolved into a violent cycle of killings, reprisals and territorial battles. By the mid-2000s, the feud had escalated into one of the deadliest urban conflicts in Karachi, with casualties running into the hundreds and paving the way for a new era of militarised gang politics.With the rise of Rehman Dakait and, later, Uzair Baloch, the Peoples’ Aman Committee (PAC) grew beyond a criminal network and evolved into a parallel governance structure in Lyari. Between roughly 2008 and 2013, researchers describe Lyari as effectively under PAC’s informal administration, with neighbourhood “commanders’’ exercising authority over small jurisdictions. These commanders managed disputes, issued permissions and collected funds in a manner that closely resembled state functions.These overlapping spheres blurred boundaries between state actors and non-state power. PAC offices routinely displayed both their own banners and PPP flags, while police operations in Lyari were often delayed, curtailed or influenced by political pressure. For a period, the PAC did not simply challenge state authority—it partially replaced it.Within Lyari, Rehman Dakait was widely viewed as being closely aligned with senior leaders of the Pakistan People's Party (PPP). Journalistic reporting and local accounts repeatedly describe him as someone who maintained proximity to the Bhutto leadership and attended major PPP political events.A popular narrative in Lyari claims that Rehman “saved” former prime minister Benazir Bhutto during the 18 October 2007 Karsaz attack in Karachi, when two explosions targeted her homecoming procession. In these accounts, Rehman is portrayed as part of an informal security circle that helped her escape following the blast. The story has fuelled his “protector” image and contributed to his Robin Hood-style mystique.However, despite the narrative’s frequency in oral history, there is no independent, verifiable evidence confirming that Rehman personally rescued Benazir or served as her driver or official security guard at any point. What is more clearly documented is the broader political relationship: Lyari’s gangs and the PPP operated in a framework of mutual benefit for years, with the party relying on armed control of the constituency and the gangs receiving political space to operate.After the PPP returned to power in 2008, Rehman publicly rebranded himself as Sardar Abdul Rehman Baloch, presenting the Peoples’ Aman Committee as a community organisation rather than a gang body. His growing political visibility, and reported sympathies with certain Baloch nationalist circles, are believed by some analysts and residents to have contributed to his killing in a controversial police “encounter” in 2009.As media scrutiny of Lyari intensified and gang violence spread to other parts of Karachi, state pressure began to mount. At the centre of this response was SSP Chaudhry Aslam Khan, an officer in the Crime Investigation Department (CID) known for aggressive policing tactics. Aslam cultivated a reputation as an “encounter specialist,” targeting both militant groups and organised crime. His public stance against Lyari gangs put him in direct confrontation with Rehman Dakait, who by the mid-2000s had become one of the most influential figures in Karachi’s underworld.Law enforcement records and press reports from the period describe a tense cat-and-mouse dynamic between the two men. Rehman repeatedly evaded capture; in at least two documented incidents, he escaped custody after allegedly bribing police officers. According to local media accounts and later investigations, Rehman paid select CID and jail officials to secure temporary releases or avoid charges, a practice facilitated by weak internal oversight and political protection. These incidents contributed to Aslam’s personal resolve. Journalists covering Karachi’s crime beat recall that Aslam increasingly framed the pursuit of Rehman as a matter of professional and personal credibility for the police force.On 9 August 2009, police announced that Rehman had been killed in a shootout near Steel Town, on Karachi’s outskirts. Officials claimed that Rehman and three accomplices opened fire on police and were killed in retaliatory fire. However, from the outset, rights groups and local residents questioned the official account. Activists, lawyers and researchers later described the killing as a likely extrajudicial execution, consistent with a broader pattern of “encounters” used in Karachi to bypass a slow judicial system and fragile witness protections.With Rehman removed, the gang landscape did not stabilise. Instead, the Peoples’ Aman Committee (PAC), which he had informally led, underwent a leadership transition. Within weeks, Uzair Jan Baloch was positioned as Rehman’s successor, assuming both the criminal networks and the political connections tied to PPP support. Unlike Rehman, whose authority rested heavily on personality and charisma, Uzair’s tenure was marked by greater bureaucratisation—defined commanders, more formalised extortion systems and deeper conflict with the state. This period would set the stage for some of the bloodiest episodes of the Lyari gang war.After Rehman Dakait’s killing in 2009, leadership of the Lyari network did not pass smoothly to a single successor. Uzair Jan Baloch projected himself as the political head of the organisation: educated, relatively well-spoken, and comfortable appearing alongside PPP leaders. His image contrasted sharply with the operational commander Noor Muhammad, better known as “Baba Ladla”, who had a reputation for ruthlessness built over years as an enforcer in neighbourhood turf battles.Initially, the two worked side by side under the Peoples’ Aman Committee (PAC) banner. But disagreements over extortion routes, neighbourhood control and access to political patrons gradually turned into open rivalry. Within Lyari, some commanders gravitated toward Uzair’s political authority and alleged links to provincial leadership; others aligned with Baba Ladla’s street power. This divide transformed PAC from a single entity into competing armed factions.The conflict reached its most infamous moment in March 2013, with the killing of rival gangster Arshad Pappu. According to court filings and media reporting, Pappu and his brother Yasir Arafat were abducted from Karachi’s Defence neighbourhood and taken to Lyari. Both were tortured, killed and later mutilated. Their remains were reportedly burned and dumped—widely interpreted as Uzair’s retaliation for the killing of his father, Faiz Muhammad. Some later accounts, including police dossiers and local testimonies, alleged that gang members kicked or played football with severed heads, turning the murders into a grim public spectacle that circulated in local narratives.By this stage, the greatest toll fell on ordinary residents. Prolonged firefights between splinter factions left neighbourhoods barricaded for days. Homes and small businesses were commandeered as torture rooms or lookout posts. Young men were coerced into gang recruitment, teachers and shopkeepers were forced to pay “taxes,” and ambulance workers trying to retrieve bodies were threatened by both sides. In response, the state increasingly turned to large-scale fires, sieges and heavy weaponry, culminating in the militarised crackdowns that would soon follow.In April–May 2012, the Sindh government initiated one of Karachi’s largest security actions against gang networks, later known as Operation Lyari. The police deployed thousands of personnel, armoured carriers and specialised units with the stated goal of clearing the area and arresting key commanders linked to the Peoples’ Aman Committee (PAC). For the first time, a formal state crackdown directly targeted the network that had operated for years through political patronage and parallel governance.The operation, however, quickly encountered intense resistance. Armed groups used heavy weaponry, including rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs), to attack the advancing police. Several armoured personnel carriers were damaged or destroyed, and police units struggled to push through Lyari’s dense alleyways, where snipers and lookout positions gave gang members a tactical advantage. After several days of fighting, rising casualties, and growing criticism from political circles, the operation stalled. It ended without major arrests and was widely perceived as a failure that exposed both the state’s limitations and PAC’s entrenched power.For residents, the consequences were immediate and severe. Lyari was effectively sealed off for about a week, with restricted movement in and out of the neighbourhood. Power and water supplies were disrupted, markets were shut, and families already living under economic strain faced shortages of food and basic essentials. Humanitarian groups and ambulance services reported being blocked or delayed from providing aid, amid police suspicions that relief efforts could serve as a cover to transport weapons or militants.The failed siege deepened mistrust between civilians, gangs and the state. Many residents had already endured years of coercive “taxes” and violence under PAC rule; the security operation then subjected them to collective punishment, indiscriminate fire and deprivation. Instead of restoring confidence, the crackdown reinforced the perception that both the state and the gangs were willing to sacrifice ordinary people to protect their own interests.Even as Lyari’s gang networks fought prolonged turf wars, Karachi was simultaneously becoming a logistical base for militant organisations, particularly factions of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). As security operations intensified in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the tribal belt, militants sought anonymity in large urban centres. Pashtun-majority neighbourhoods such as Sohrab Goth, Manghopir and SITE became key sanctuaries and transit corridors where fighters, explosives and finances could be moved with relative ease.The turning point came on 8 June 2014, when ten militants launched an armed assault on Karachi’s Jinnah International Airport, using automatic weapons, grenades and a rocket launcher. The attack triggered an overnight battle that left at least 36 people dead, including all ten assailants. The incident severely embarrassed federal authorities and exposed vulnerabilities in Karachi’s security infrastructure. The scale of the attack underscored that the city’s violence was no longer just about gangs—it was also linked to national insurgency networks.In the aftermath, the state expanded its response. The federal and provincial governments granted Pakistan Rangers (Sindh) extensive policing and detention powers to target both militants and criminal networks. These operations aligned with ongoing national counterinsurgency campaigns, including Operation Zarb-e-Azb and later Operation Radd-ul-Fasaad, which aimed to dismantle militant networks and disrupt their finances and recruitment pipelines.In Karachi, this translated into a sustained, multi-year crackdown led by the Rangers. Tactical raids, mass arrests, prolonged detentions under special legal provisions and high-profile encounters became common features of urban policing. In Lyari, the result was a shrinking space for gangs to openly control territory. The Peoples’ Aman Committee and splinter factions still operated, but their public influence diminished as armed checkpoints, displays of heavy weaponry and enforced taxation became more difficult to sustain. Although pockets of violence persisted, the crackdown marked the beginning of the end of large, overt gang administrations in the city.One of the most high-profile casualties in the post-2014 security phase was SSP Chaudhry Aslam Khan, the police officer who had led major operations against both Lyari gangs and militant networks. On 9 January 2014, a suicide bomber drove an explosives-laden vehicle into Aslam’s convoy in Karachi, killing him and at least three others. The Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) claimed responsibility, calling the attack revenge for police operations against its fighters and financiers. Aslam’s death was widely perceived as a serious setback to the city’s counter-terror and anti-gang efforts, though operations continued under other police officers and with greater reliance on Pakistan Rangers (Sindh).For Lyari’s armed groups, the most decisive blow came three years later. Acting on intelligence reports, Pakistan Rangers (Sindh) launched a pre-dawn raid on 2 February 2017 in Phool Patti Lane, Lyari, targeting Noor Muhammad, better known as “Baba Ladla.” According to Rangers’ statements, a gun battle lasting over 30 minutes ensued, during which gang members used automatic weapons and grenades. By the end of the raid, Rangers announced that Baba Ladla and two close associates had been killed.Listed for years among Pakistan’s “most wanted” criminals, Baba Ladla faced cases ranging from murder and extortion to armed attacks on police and suspected collaborations with extremist groups. His death effectively dismantled a key pillar of the Uzair-era structure, removing the most prominent operational commander who had challenged both rivals inside Lyari and the security forces sent to eliminate them.By the mid-2010s, as state pressure intensified and gang structures were fractured by successive operations, Uzair Jan Baloch left Pakistan. In December 2015, Interpol arrested him at Dubai International Airport, reportedly while he was travelling from Muscat. He was subsequently handed over to Pakistani authorities and brought back to Karachi.From 2016 onward, Uzair was charged in dozens of criminal cases, ranging from murder and attempted murder to extortion, kidnapping and terrorism. Many of these cases have since resulted in acquittals due to lack of evidence, hostile witnesses or procedural weaknesses—a pattern that has long characterised Karachi’s organised crime trials, where intimidation makes witness testimony difficult.In April 2017, a new dimension emerged when the Pakistan Army took custody of Uzair to try him under military law. He was accused of espionage and leaking sensitive information to a foreign intelligence agency, reportedly linked to Iran. In April 2020, a military court sentenced him to 12 years in prison on espionage charges, marking a significant shift in how the state officially characterized him—not merely as a gang leader, but as a potential national security threat.Pakistani officials and segments of local media have occasionally linked Uzair’s alleged intelligence connections to the controversial case of Kulbhushan Jadhav, the Indian national sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court in 2017. One strand of narrative suggests that Uzair’s alleged contacts in Iran overlapped with networks also linked to Jadhav. However, India has rejected Pakistan’s claims in the Jadhav case as coerced and unsubstantiated, and publicly verifiable evidence connecting Uzair directly to operational support for Jadhav remains limited.What is clearer is that, from the perspective of the Pakistani state, Uzair Baloch’s profile evolved from that of a gang leader embedded in local politics to an alleged cross-border security risk—reshaping the narrative around Lyari’s gangs and their significance.As violence worsened and Lyari began drawing national and even international scrutiny, the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) gradually shifted its stance on the Peoples’ Aman Committee (PAC). Between 2012 and 2013, amid pressure from rival parties, security agencies and media coverage, the PPP formally disowned the PAC, despite years of visible proximity.Senior party leaders later framed PAC figures as rogue actors or products of state neglect, arguing that they were not part of a deliberate political strategy. Critics, however—including journalists, residents and some researchers—contend that the PPP benefitted for years from PAC’s armed control of Lyari, only distancing itself once the political and reputational costs became unsustainable.This distancing reflected a broader shift: as the state redefined Lyari’s gangs from political intermediaries to security liabilities, political actors recalibrated their alliances. What had once been an informal partnership built on patronage and vote control became a liability in the age of counterterrorism and international scrutiny.Security indicators suggest that overt gang violence in Lyari has dropped sharply since the mid-2010s. Rangers-led operations, the removal or incarceration of key gang leaders such as Rehman, Uzair and Baba Ladla, and broader counter-terror campaigns have reduced the frequency of armed clashes and targeted killings in the area.The legacy of the Lyari gang war remains unfinished. For many families, the years of kidnappings, torture, blockades and forced recruitment left deep social and economic scars. Questions continue to surround extrajudicial killings, disappearances and the conduct of both the gangs and state agencies tasked with fighting them. Although large armed networks have been dismantled, traces of informal control and low-level criminality persist in new forms.At the same time, Lyari’s cultural and political identity is evolving again. The football grounds, community schools and cultural centres that once defined the neighbourhood are re-emerging, even as residents remain wary of new power brokers. In popular culture, recent portrayals such as Dhurandhar and other planned projects reflect an enduring public fascination with Lyari—its blurred boundaries between criminal groups, political actors and state security agencies, and the unanswered questions they leave behind.Seen in retrospect, the gang war was not merely the story of violent figures in a marginalised settlement. It grew out of structural inequality, weak state institutions and a political party’s reliance on armed intermediaries to protect its vote bank. As militancy and regional intelligence rivalries later intersected with local crime networks, a neighbourhood built from labour and sport became entangled in national security narratives.Lyari today is quieter, but its past continues to shape how residents understand politics, policing and protection. The names of Rehman Dakait, Uzair Baloch, Baba Ladla and Arshad Pappu remain part of local memory—sometimes condemned as criminals, sometimes recalled as flawed protectors, always as evidence of how quickly a working-class community can become a battleground when crime, politics and security policy converge.","Karachi’s Lyari has long been associated with a dual identity. To its residents, it is the ‘mother of Karachi’ – powered by dockworkers, truck drivers, boxers and footballers. To the rest of Pakistan, especially through the 1990s and 2000s, it came to signify something very different: a “mini Brazil” of football- obsessed alleys, heavily armed gangs, and extortion rackets. It is this layered, contradictory Lyari that Aditya Dhar's recent 'Dhurandhar' turns into cinema.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125768364,imgsize-87724,width-400,resizemode-4/lyari-gang-war.jpg"

'Munir Is A Mentally Unstable Man': Ex-Pakistan PM Imran Khan Blames Army Chief of Fueling Terrorism





Pakistan’s jailed former prime minister Imran Khan on Wednesday launched a sharp attack on the country’s army chief and de-facto ruler Asim Munir , calling him a ""mentally unstable man."" He also claimed that field marshal Munir’s policies were ""disastrous"" for Pakistan and accused him of intentionally ""igniting tensions"" with Afghanistan.The 73-year-old former cricketer-turned-politician shared these remarks on social media a day after his sister, Dr Uzma Khan, met him in Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail. The meeting took place after more than a month, following “special permission” from Shehbaz Sharif ’s government, amid widespread rumours on social media about Imran’s health and safety after he was placed in solitary confinement.In a post on X written in Urdu, Khan said, “Asim Munir’s policies are disastrous for Pakistan. Because of his policies, terrorism has spiralled out of control that grieves me deeply.”He further alleged, “Asim Munir has no concern for Pakistan’s national interests. He is doing all this merely to please Western powers. He deliberately ignited tensions with Afghanistan so that he could be seen internationally as a so-called 'mujahid'.”The PTI founder said he had always opposed “drone attacks and military operations against own people in the country which he said would only fuel more terrorism.”He claimed, “Munir first threatened Afghans, then expelled refugees from Pakistan and carried out drone strikes whose consequences we now face in the form of rising terrorism.”Calling Munir a “mentally unstable man,” Khan alleged that the army chief’s “moral bankruptcy has led to the complete collapse of the Constitution and rule of law in Pakistan.”He also accused Munir of being behind the cases against him and his wife, saying they had been “imprisoned in fabricated cases and subjected to the worst form of psychological torture.”Khan described his prison conditions, saying, “I have been kept in complete solitary confinement, locked inside a cell with no contact with a single human being for four weeks. I was kept entirely cut off from the outside world, and even the basic necessities guaranteed under the jail manual have been taken away from us.”He added that despite court orders, his meetings with political colleagues were stopped, and now even his access to lawyers and family had been cut off. “Pick up any human rights charter, psychological torture is considered 'torture' and is deemed even more severe than physical torture. My sister Noreen Niazi was dragged on the road simply for demanding her legitimate right to meet me,” he said.Khan praised Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Sohail Afridi for showing courage during what he called an “environment of repression.” He wrote, “I ask him to continue to play on the front foot. There is no law or Constitution in this country. The law is enforced only against PTI as everyone else is exempt. Those threatening governor’s rule in KP should impose it today rather than tomorrow and then watch what happens to them. ”Speculation about Khan’s health had grown after an undeclared ban was imposed on meeting him. Uzma, after seeing her brother, said his health was “perfectly fine” but he was being subjected to “mental torture in solitary confinement.”“Praise be to Allah! His health is perfectly fine. However, he was very angry and said that they are subjecting him to mental torture,” she said.","Imran Khan says Asim Munir's policies are ""disastrous"" for Pakistan. He accuses Munir of intentionally ""igniting tensions"" with Afghanistan.

Pakistan will hold bidding on December 23 to sell its state-owned carrier, Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), state media reported on Wednesday.The loss-making airline is being privatised as part of a $7 billion International Monetary Fund (IMF) program , which requires the federal government to reform or divest struggling state enterprises. A previous attempt to offload PIA last year was scrapped after the government failed to receive a sufficiently attractive offer.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met with corporate entities and company representatives involved in the process, according to a press release shared by state broadcaster PTV News. “PIA’s bidding will take place on December 23, which will be broadcast live on all media. We are ensuring transparency and merit in the privatisation process,” the statement quoted him as saying.Sharif said the process was proceeding “smoothly” and argued that privatisation would help restore the airline’s “lost prestige,” align it with modern aviation requirements and facilitate the restoration of PIA’s global flight operations — a step he said was crucial for overseas Pakistanis.If completed, the transaction would mark Pakistan’s first major privatisation in nearly two decades.Founded in October 1946, PIA is based at Karachi’s Jinnah International Airport, the country’s second-busiest airport and its largest city’s main aviation hub.","Pakistan will hold bidding on December 23 to sell its state-owned carrier, Pakistan International Airlines.

NEW DELHI: Imran Khan’s sister on Tuesday said the former Pakistan prime minister is “completely fine” and in good health, after she was finally allowed to meet him inside Adiala Jail following weeks of restricted access that had fuelled protests and rumours about his condition.Authorities at Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail permitted Imran’s sister Uzma Khanum to meet him on Tuesday, breaking a prolonged period during which family members and PTI leaders were repeatedly denied access. According to Pakistan news outlet Dawn, Uzma entered the prison as several PTI supporters gathered outside demanding transparency on Imran’s health.Following the meeting, PTI USA shared her remarks, quoting her as saying, “Imran Khan’s health is perfectly fine. However, he said that they are subjecting him to mental torture, and that Asim Munir is responsible for all of this.”AccordingUzma said that Imran Khan was kept in his room throughout the day, allowed only limited time outside, and had no communication with anyone. The meeting lasted around 30 minutes, she told the publication.Read more: Can Imran Khan meet visitors in jail?

There has been absolutely no contact with Pakistan’s former Prime Minister Imran Khan , which has intensified speculation about his possible death. Demanding access to the PTI founder, party members have decided to stage a protest despite the restrictions imposed by the Pakistan government.Following the PTI workers' announcement of protests outside the Islamabad High Court and Adiala Jail, Section 144 was enforced in both cities. However, the order has not deterred Imran Khan’s supporters. They declared their protest plans even as restrictions have been in place since November 18 for two months.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi on Sunday declared that the party would stage a major protest outside the Islamabad High Court on Monday, followed by another demonstration outside Adiala Jail on Tuesday. Speaking at a press conference at the CM House, Afridi claimed that Imran Khan, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder, has been held in “complete isolation” since November 4, with no one granted access to him.He said that Khan’s sisters, senior party leaders, lawyers, and even doctors have all been barred from meeting him, effectively placing him in total solitary confinement—a situation he described as “extremely alarming.”PTI leaders have been demanding access to the party founder, Imran Khan. After KP CM Afridi ordered the party members to immediately move to Islamabad, the party has also asked the supporters to gather outside the Adiala Jail later.Talking to reporters, Afridi said that on Tuesday, all parliamentarians would first gather at the IHC to stage a strong protest before the court’s chief justice, noting that despite judicial orders, he himself was not allowed to meet Khan.“This is blatant contempt of court. We will hold a protest at the IHC,” Afridi asserted.He said the parliamentarians would then move to Adiala Jail to attempt to meet Khan and to express solidarity with his sisters.Following the announcement of protests, the Rawalpindi deputy commissioner's office issued the notice on Monday that Section 144 shall be imposed in the city from December 1 to December 3. According to the notice, the order has been enforced on the basis of “imminent threats” identified by the district intelligence committee (DIC), particularly in and around sensitive installations, major roads and other critical infrastructure. The committee’s assessment underpinned the local government’s decision to restrict public gatherings during this period.The Rawalpindi notification prohibits all kinds of gatherings of more than five people. As per the statement, ""All kinds of Assemblies, Gatherings, Sits-in, Rallies, Processions, Demonstrations, Jalsas, Dharnas, Protests and such like other activities, i.e gathering of 05 or more persons.""""Carrying of weapons, spikes, laden batons, gaulails, ball bearings, petrol bombs, improvised explosives or any other instrument that could potentially be used for violence,"" is also listed as one of the restrictions in the notice.Along with these, pillion riding and the use of loudspeakers or display of ""arms and hatred speeches"" are also prohibited.The Islamabad district magistrate’s office issued the order after what it described as “certain segments of society … planning to organise unlawful assemblies … within the jurisdiction of Islamabad Capital Territory,” according to a report in Dawn. The announcement in Rawalpindi came through a notification from the deputy commissioner’s office, which cited security concerns due to potential large gatherings.In Islamabad, the order did not define what would constitute an “unlawful assembly” but noted that authorities deemed it “necessary to control such types of illegal activities which present a threat to public peace, tranquillity and maintenance of law & order.”Pakistan’s former Prime Minister has remained completely out of sight for more than six weeks, with neither his party members nor his family able to establish any direct contact during this period. His prolonged absence from public view has intensified anxiety across the country, fuelling widespread speculation and deepening fears about his safety.The lack of verified updates or appearances has further heightened concerns, with many questioning whether the politician-turned-cricketer may have become the target of a possible assassination attempt or is otherwise being kept in undisclosed conditions.Khan’s sons fear authorities may be hiding “something irreversible” about his condition. His son, Kasim Khan, told Reuters that the family has had no direct or verifiable contact with the jailed former Prime Minister, despite a court order allowing weekly meetings.“Not knowing whether your father is safe, harmed, or even alive is psychological torture,” he said, noting that there has been no independently confirmed communication for months.“We have no reliable information about his condition,” he added. “Our deepest fear is that something irreversible is being kept from us.”Khan’s sister, Aleema Khan, filed a contempt of court petition in the IHC on November 28 against the Adiala Jail superintendent and other officials, alleging they prevented her from meeting her brother.Submitting the petition in the presence of Chief Minister Afridi, she cited the IHC’s March 24 order, which had restored a twice-weekly visitation schedule for the 73-year-old former prime minister.Pakistan government officials have rejected rumours that Imran Khan has died in custody or been quietly moved out of Adiala Jail, insisting he remains inside the Rawalpindi facility and is in stable condition.“There is no truth to claims of his transfer from Adiala Jail. He is in good health and receiving full medical care,” Geo News quoted Rawalpindi prison officials as saying.Imran Khan is currently being held in Adiala Jail, where a court first handed him a three-year prison term in August 2023 in the Al-Qadir Trust case. Since then, successive corruption convictions have pushed his total sentence to 14 years, the longest jail term imposed on him so far.","Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leaders have been demanding access to the party founder, Imran Khan. KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi claimed that Imran Khan has been held in “complete isolation” since November 4. Khan’s sisters, senior party leaders, lawyers, and even doctors have all been barred from meeting him.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125710838,imgsize-1508415,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

In a first, the Baloch Liberation Front (BLF) used a woman fidayeen operative to storm a heavily-guarded complex belonging to the Frontier Corps and housing a Chinese copper and gold mining project center located in Chagai, Balochistan. Six Pak personnel were reportedly killed in Sunday evening’s attack but there was no official word from the Pak authorities.The BLF also released the photo of the bomber, Zareena Rafiq aka Trang Mahoo, who detonated herself at the barrier to allow the rebel fighters to breach the main compound. The attack is significant because it is the first time the BLF has used a suicide bomber, a tactic exclusive to Majeed Brigade of the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) which has carried out a series of attacks including the Jaffar Express hijack in the region.The fact that the complex was linked to the Saindak and Reko Diq projects, managed by Chinese companies and a Canadian firm, indicates the change in rebels’ strategy to strike high-value assets with geopolitical significance, sources said. In a statement released on Telegram, the BLF spokesperson Gwahram Baloch said that the Fidayeen operation was carried out by its ‘selfsacrifice’ unit, Saddo Operational Battalion (SOB), named after Martyred Commander Waja Sado aka Sadath Marri.Meanwhile the BLA released a statement on the wave of coordinated attacks carried out at multiple locations between Nov 28-29, claiming 27 Pak army personnel were killed in 29 attacks. The BLA also said it had taken control of motorways and seized weapons.BLA fighters struck the Pakistani army’s Coast Guard camp in the Pasni area of Gwadar with multiple grenade launchers. They targeted military intelligence personnel in the Jiwani area of Gwadar with a remote-controlled IED attack while they were returning after extorting money from vehicles, the BLA said. Another attack was on the residence of a Pakistani army major in Mastung city.Six blasts were reported at defence installations in Quetta as well.

Pakistan Rages At UN After Criticism Of Munir’s Immunity Amendment Amid Fears Of Deeper Militarism

Also Read |





Author and National Security Advisory Board (NSAB) member Tilak Devasher claimed that Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is “intentionally” staying out of the country to avoid being present when the notification would be issued for the appointment of the first-ever Chief of Defence Forces (CDF).Created through the 27th amendment to Pakistan’s constitution, the post is set to be assumed by Field Marshal Asim Munir, potentially making him the most powerful army chief in the country’s history.Speaking to ANI, Devasher highlighted that Sharif left for Bahrain and then London, leading to speculation that he's ""deliberately"" staying away to avoid issuing the notification.“Very smartly, the Pakistan PM went to Bahrain and then to London. He clearly does not want to issue the notification giving Asim Munir five years as army chief and as Chief of Defence Forces. He seems to believe that by staying away and avoiding signing the notification, he can escape the consequences,” said Devasher, author of four books on Pakistan.The comment comes after Sharif’s government failed to issue the required notification appointing Munir as the first-ever CDF by the November 29 deadline—the day his original three-year term as army chief ended.With the creation of the CDF post, the office of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee has formally been abolished.Devasher added that Pakistan is currently navigating a “very messy” situation.“If it turns out that he (Asim Munir) is no longer the army chief, then Pakistan finds itself without an army chief, and even the nuclear command authority—meant to fall under the new Strategic Forces Command—is effectively leaderless. It’s an extremely strange situation,” he remarked.Legal experts remain divided over whether the notification is necessary. Under the amended Constitution, the Chief of Army Staff’s term is meant to run concurrently with the CDF, lasting five years.Some analysts, however, argue that the issue may already be addressed by the Pakistan Army Act’s 2024 amendment, which extended the tenure of service chiefs to five years, according to Dawn. The amendment includes a “deeming” clause stating it “shall always be deemed to have been part of the Pakistan Army Act,” implying that Munir’s current term could automatically extend from three to five years without any additional notification.Devasher, however, called this interpretation “controversial,” questioning the view that a notification may not be required.“Some people argue that the Army Act was amended in 2004, setting the army chief’s tenure at five years. Since he has already served three, he supposedly has another two years remaining. From this perspective, no new notification would be required. This is controversial, and it’s unclear how the judiciary or the government will view it. But the fact remains that it makes his position very tenuous,” Devasher said.He also pointed to what he described as political manoeuvring within the military. “There are reports that other generals are now jostling for the position of army chief or for the two newly created four-star posts,” he stated.Devasher added that Prime Minister Sharif’s absence is only deepening the uncertainty. “But this situation cannot continue,” he warned. “A nuclear-armed country cannot function without a Chief of the Army Staff or someone in charge of the nuclear command authority.”","Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is ""intentionally"" staying out of the country to avoid being present when the notification would be issued for the appointment of the first-ever Chief of Defence Forces.

Fresh violence broke out in Pakistan after a suicide bomber detonated himself at the main gate of the Frontier Corps (FC) headquarters in Nokkundi, Balochistan, sparking an intense exchange of fire and a major security response, Dawn reported.The attack, claimed to be the work of militants described by officials as Fitna-al-Khawarij — the state’s term for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) — triggered a swift retaliatory operation in which three attackers were killed.According to FC Balochistan South, the assault began when a suicide bomber blew himself up at the entrance, allowing several armed militants to force their way into the compound. Security personnel from the quick response force immediately engaged the attackers, with heavy gunfire reported from the area. Officials said at least six gunmen were believed to have entered the headquarters, prompting a full-scale clearance operation that continued through the day.In a statement, the FC spokesperson said troops were determined to neutralise the remaining threat, adding that the “last of the terrorists will also be” dealt with.Local reports described sustained firing inside the headquarters as forces worked room-to-room to secure the facility.The incident comes just days after a similar assault on an FC compound in the northwestern city of Peshawar, where gunmen and two suicide bombers stormed a paramilitary headquarters, killing three people. Police had said the first bomber detonated at the main entrance while the second entered the compound, forcing law enforcement to cordon off the busy FC Chowk area amid multiple explosions.These attacks form part of a broader escalation in militant violence this year. Earlier attacks in Quetta — including a deadly car bomb outside a paramilitary base and a suicide blast at a political rally — have added to growing instability in Balochistan. The province has endured a long-running insurgency, with hundreds of security personnel killed in 2024 alone, alongside attacks claimed by separatist groups such as the Baloch Liberation Army.","Suicide bomber detonates himself at the main gate of the Frontier Corps (FC) headquarters in Nokkundi, Balochistan.

Pakistan Army General Warns Of Hybrid-To-Full War As Pakistan Reshapes Military Power Under Munir





At least seven explosions were reported in Pakistan’s Balochistan province over the past 24 hours, with suspected insurgents targeting sites in Quetta and Dera Murad Jamali. No casualties were reported, although two security guards with a construction company were injured in the attacks.The incidents triggered fear and panic in the provincial capital.On Saturday, insurgents hurled hand grenades at a police checkpoint in Quetta, followed by the detonation of an IED near an Anti-Terrorism Department vehicle. Three additional explosions took place later in the evening, as cited by PTI.Senior Superintendent of Police Asif Khan said the blast near Lohr Karez, on the outskirts of Quetta, damaged the main line connecting the city with other parts of the country.SSP Khan said the attackers had planted IEDs on a railway track and detonated them as a train was scheduled to arrive at Quetta station. The blast damaged the track and forced the suspension of rail services.Khan added that armed men also attacked a construction company site on Quetta’s Sariab Road with hand grenades, damaging machinery and injuring two security guards. In another incident, motorcycle-borne insurgents hurled two hand grenades at the Manzoor Shaheed police station, one of which exploded while the other was defused by a bomb disposal squad.In Dera Murad Jamali, a patrolling police vehicle was targeted with hand grenades.Attackers also threw hand grenades in the Kech Beg area near a police patrol post in Quetta.No group immediately claimed responsibility for Saturday’s attacks, but insurgent activity resumed on Sunday morning.Earlier this year, at least ten people were killed and several others injured when a powerful car bomb exploded outside the paramilitary headquarters in Quetta.On September 3, a suicide bombing at a political rally in the city killed 11 people and wounded more than 40, targeting a stadium parking area where hundreds of Balochistan National Party supporters had gathered.Pakistani forces continue to battle a longstanding insurgency in Balochistan, which has claimed 782 lives in 2024. In March, the Baloch Liberation Army hijacked a train and killed off-duty troops. Since January, more than 430 people, most of them security personnel, have been killed in various attacks, including six soldiers in Bannu.","At least seven explosions reported in Pakistan's Balochistan province over the past 24 hours.

Brazening it out, Pakistan on Sunday dismissed UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk’s concerns over the country’s recent 27th constitutional amendment, urging him to avoid remarks that reflect “political bias and misinformation. ”“Like all parliamentary democracies, all legislation as well as any amendment to the constitution remain the exclusive domain of the elected representatives of the people of Pakistan. While Pakistan gives due importance to the work of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, it is regrettable that Pakistan's views and ground realities were not reflected in the statement issued,” the Foreign Office (FO) said in a statement.The FO added that Pakistan remains “fully committed to protecting, promoting and upholding human rights, human dignity, basic freedoms and the rule of law as enshrined in the constitution”.“It is regrettable that Pakistan's views and ground realities were not reflected in the remarks. We urge the High Commissioner to respect the sovereign decisions of Pakistan's parliament and avoid commentary that reflects political bias and misinformation,"" it stated.In a statement on Friday, Türk criticised Islamabad for adopting the amendment without “broad consultation” with legal experts and civil society, warning that the “hastily adopted” changes could undermine judicial independence and raise questions about military accountability.The 27th amendment has stirred intense political debate within the neighbouring nation. On November 12, a joint parliamentary committee of the Senate and National Assembly approved the bill , prompting the opposition to warn that the government was sounding “the death knell for the Supreme Court”.The amendment alters Article 243 by abolishing the post of Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC) and replacing it with a new Chief of Defence Forces (CDF). It also proposes establishing a Federal Constitutional Court and reducing certain powers of the Supreme Court.The first CDF will be Asim Munir, the Pakistan Army chief who was “promoted” to the five-star Field Marshal rank following the conflict with India in May.According to Dawn, the Pakistan government is yet to notify the appointment of the CDF, even as the office of the CJCSC formally ended on Thursday.",Pakistan dismisses UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk's concerns over the country’s recent 27th constitutional amendment.

IMD Issues Red Alert as Cyclone Ditwah Approaches TN; Sri Lanka Deaths Exceed 80





Sri Lankan authorities on Sunday issued fresh landslide warnings as persistent rains battered regions already devastated by Cyclone Ditwah, intensifying what officials describe as the island’s worst natural disaster in decades. At least 618 people are reported dead, with many still missing as rescue teams struggle to reach isolated communities.A chain of tropical storms and monsoonal downpours has cut a destructive path across Southeast and South Asia over the past two weeks. The storms have triggered landslides, flooded wide stretches of land, and severed access to remote settlements from Sumatra’s rainforests to Sri Lanka’s hill country. Across Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam, at least 1,812 people have died in the unfolding regional crisis, AFP reported.In Sri Lanka alone, more than two million people nearly 10 per cent of the population have been affected. The Disaster Management Centre (DMC) warned that continuing monsoon storms were making hillsides increasingly unstable, particularly in the central mountains and north-western midlands.Helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft were deployed to supply communities cut off by landslides, while the Sri Lanka Air Force confirmed it had received a planeload of relief supplies from Myanmar.Authorities have reported 618 deaths and 209 people unaccounted for, with the central tea-growing region suffering the highest number of casualties. The count of people in state-run shelters has fallen to 100,000 from a peak of 225,000 as waters recede. According to the DMC, nearly 75,000 homes were damaged, including almost 5,000 completely destroyed.The Sri Lankan government on Friday announced a major compensation plan enabling survivors to purchase land in safer zones and rebuild homes. Additional assistance will cover school supplies, household essentials and rent for families not accommodated by the state. AFP reported that a compensation of one million rupees will be offered for each person killed or permanently disabled.According to the UN news, Cyclone Ditwah made landfall on November 28 before looping back over the Bay of Bengal, unleashing some of the worst flooding Sri Lanka has experienced since the early 2000s.

Afghanistan FM Muttaqi Defends India Ties, Slams Pakistan Over Deoband Row And Shifting Accusations





Four civilians and a soldier were killed in overnight shelling and gunfire along the Pakistan–Afghanistan border, Afghan officials said on Saturday, marking the latest outbreak of violence between the two countries despite a ceasefire agreement reached after deadly clashes in October.Five other civilians were wounded on the Afghan side, government spokesman Hamdullah Fitrat said in a video statement. A hospital in the Pakistani town of Chaman reported three people with minor injuries following the exchange.Both sides accused each other of firing first near the busy Chaman–Spin Boldak crossing in southern Afghanistan. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said on X that Pakistan “started attacking Afghanistan in Kandahar, Spin Boldak district, and the forces of the Islamic Emirate were forced to respond.” Pakistan prime minister’s spokesman Mosharraf Zaidi alleged that “the Afghan Taliban regime resorted to unprovoked firing” along the border.Local Afghan officials said “light and heavy artillery” was used, with mortar shells striking civilian homes. Residents told AFP that firing began around 10:30 pm and escalated rapidly. One resident described mortars hitting houses after tank fire, while another said his brother was killed when trying to reach a different room during the shelling.People on the Pakistan side said families took shelter indoors as mortar rounds landed near homes.Tensions have surged since the Taliban returned to power in 2021, with Islamabad accusing Kabul of harbouring militant groups, including the Pakistani Taliban (TTP), responsible for attacks inside Pakistan. Kabul denies the allegations. More than 70 people were killed in October clashes before Qatar and Turkey brokered a ceasefire. Talks in Doha and Istanbul since then have failed to produce a lasting settlement, and the border remains closed.Pakistan recently announced it would partially reopen the frontier at Chaman for United Nations aid deliveries. Pakistan’s spokesman Zaidi told AFP the latest clash would “have no impact on that decision,” adding that humanitarian access would continue separately.","Four civilians and a soldier were killed in overnight shelling and gunfire along the Pakistan–Afghanistan border.

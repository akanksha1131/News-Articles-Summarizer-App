Madagascar expelled from African Union







Madagascar's Colonel Michael Randrianirina is set to be sworn in as the country's transitional president on Friday.Randrianirina and the transitional government have pledged to hold elections in 18 to 24 months, telling local media that consultations were under way to appoint a prime minister and form a new government.It all comes after Randrianirina announced on Tuesday that the armed forces were taking power of the country, following the impeachment of former president Andry Rajoelina, who fled the country.Protests against Rajoelina and his government, led by youth groups calling themselves ""Gen Z Madagascar,"" had rocked the country for weeks prior to the military takeover.""It wasn't a coup, it was a case of taking responsibility because the country was on the brink of collapse,"" Randrianirina said.He confirmed that the military had taken power and dissolved all institutions except the lower house of parliament, or National Assembly.Randrianirina was a commander in the elite CAPSAT military unit that played a key role in the 2009 coup that brought Rajoelina to power in the first place.The international community has expressed concern over the swift change in power in the poor island nation.The African Union said on Wednesday it was suspending Madagascar ""with immediate effect"" from the bloc.Meanwhile, the UN said it was ""deeply concerned by the unconstitutional change of power.""France, former colonial ruler in Madagascar, urged in a statement that it was ""now essential that democracy, fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law be scrupulously upheld.""A spokesman for the German foreign ministry said all actors needed to ""act with caution in this currently somewhat confusing situation.""","Madagascar's Colonel Michael Randrianirina is set to be sworn in as the country's transitional president on Friday.

'Deliberate': At least one US strike on 'drug-carrying' boats targeted Colombians,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/deliberate-at-least-one-us-strike-on-drug-carrying-boats-targeted-colombians-report/articleshow/124593114.cms,"US strikes drug-smuggling boat off Venezuela coast (SOurce: X@PeteHegseth)





At least one of the recent US military strikes on suspected drug-smuggling boats targeted Colombian nationals aboard a vessel that had departed from Colombia, according to two individuals briefed by the Pentagon.Since September, the US has carried out at least five strikes on suspected drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean, including the most recent on October 14. The third strike, on September 19, targeted the Colombians, as per the sources.“It was deliberate. Though the boat was suspected of carrying people affiliated with Colombian terrorist organisations, the Pentagon was unable to determine the identities of each individual before the strike,” they told CNN The disclosure comes even as US President Donald Trump publicly confirmed that he authorised the CIA to operate in Venezuela to curb illegal flows of migrants and drugs from Colombia's fellow South American nation. Of the targeted vessels, four had departed from Venezuela.“We have a lot of drugs coming in from Venezuela, and a lot of the Venezuelan drugs come in through the sea, so you get to see that, but we’re going to stop them by land also,” Trump said during an Oval Office event on Wednesday.Colombian President Gustavo Petro, whose US visa was recently revoked, had previously suggested that those aboard the September 19 vessel were Colombians.“If the boat was sunk in the Dominican Republic, then it is possible that they were Colombians. This means that officials from the US and the Dominican Republic would be guilty of the murder of Colombian citizens,” Petro posted on X.After the fourth strike, on October 2, he again hinted, citing “indications,” that those victims were also Colombians. “The aggression is against all of Latin America and the Caribbean,” he added.White House spokesperson Anna Kelly told CNN that every strike targeted “designated narco-terrorists bringing deadly poison to our shores.”“On the campaign trail, President Trump promised to take on the cartels – and he has taken unprecedented action to stop the scourge of narcoterrorism that has resulted in the needless deaths of innocent Americans,” Kelly noted, adding that the president “will continue to use every element of American power to stop drugs from flooding into our country and to bring those responsible to justice.”","Since September, the US has carried out at least five strikes on suspected drug- smuggling boats in the Caribbean.

US Attacks 5th Narco Vessel Off Venezuela’s Coast; Maduro Fumes, Takes Big Pledge

US-Venezuela tensions





US President Donald Trump on Wednesday (local time) confirmed that he has authorised the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to conduct a ""covert operation"" in Venezuela, amid escalating tensions between the two countries.Trump made the rare admission during a Q&A session at the Oval Office after being asked about a New York Times report on the matter.“I authorised it for two reasons,” he said. “First, Venezuela emptied its prisons and mental institutions into the United States. They came through the border because of our open-border policy. Thousands of prisoners and mentally ill people entered the country—we’re sending them back. Many countries have done it, but not like Venezuela. They were down and dirty.”The second reason, he added, was the ""flow of drugs"" into the US from the South American nation.Trump did not answer whether the CIA has permission to ""eliminate"" Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, but suggested that the measures are designed to intensify ""pressure: on Caracas. ""I think Venezuela is feeling heat. ... We're not going to let our country be ruined because other people want to drop, as you say, their worst ...we're not going to take them,"" he remarked.In response, Maduro decried what he described as ""coups d'etat orchestrated by the CIA.""""No to war in the Caribbean...No to regime change...No to coups d'etat orchestrated by the CIA,"" he told a committee set up after Washington deployed warships in the Caribbean for an ""anti-drug operation.""Since early September, US forces have destroyed five suspected drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean—four of which originated from Venezuela—killing 27 people.Earlier this month, the administration classified drug cartels as “unlawful combatants” and announced that the United States is now in an “armed conflict” with them, calling the move a necessary escalation to stop the flow of narcotics.The decision triggered bipartisan backlash in Congress, with lawmakers accusing Trump of committing an “act of war” without seeking legislative approval.Officials familiar with the issue noted that the administration has yet to present evidence confirming that the targeted vessels were carrying narcotics.Defending the operation, Trump argued that traditional anti-smuggling efforts had failed.“We’ve been doing it for 30 years, and it’s been totally ineffective,” he remarked. “They have faster boats—they’re world-class speedboats—but they’re not faster than missiles.”","US President Donald Trump confirmed that he has authorised the CIA to conduct a ""covert operation"" in Venezuela.

‘Proud dad of US Marine’ deported by ICE agents moments after visiting pregnant daughter at California military base,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/proud-dad-of-us-marine-deported-by-ice-agents-moments-after-visiting-pregnant-daughter-at-california-military-base/articleshow/124590347.cms,"(Phoro: X)





A US Marine’s father was deported and his mother detained after both were arrested by federal immigration officials while visiting family at Camp Pendleton in California.Under the MAGA government, immigration enforcement is even affecting military families.Steve Rios, a Marine from Oceanside, said his parents, Esteban Rios and Luisa Rodriguez, went to Camp Pendleton on September 28 to have breakfast with his pregnant sister, Ashley Rios, and her husband, who is also a Marine.The couple was stopped at the gate by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents.“They were taken into custody and later released with ankle monitors,” Steve Rios said. “At a later check-in with federal immigration officials, they were detained again.”The arrested parents came to the United States from Mexico 30 years ago, reports NBC 7 San Diego.Esteban Rios was wearing a red shirt and a white hat reading “Proud dad of a U.S. Marine” when he was taken into custody, his son said. “He said, ‘Yeah, this is my lucky shirt, so we’ll be fine,’” Steve recalled. By October 10, Esteban had been deported, while his mother’s whereabouts remained unknown.Neither parent had a criminal record, and both had pending green card applications, which Steve Rios said he had sponsored.“It was scary because my whole life, it’s been in the back of my head,” he said. “They’ve worked tirelessly cleaning houses and cars all these years. It was just making them proud.”Ashley Rios, expecting her first child, said it was difficult not having her parents nearby. “I'd always want my mom in that delivery room and everything, so it’s just hard not to think about your parents there,” she said.An ICE spokesperson told NBC, “All aliens in violation of U.S. immigration law may be subject to arrest, detention and, if found removable by final order, removal from the United States, regardless of nationality.” The department added that it enforces laws against those who break them.The case is part of a broader push by the MAGA administration to enforce immigration laws more strictly, which has occasionally affected the families of military personnel and veterans. In recent months, other military families have also reported ICE detaining relatives despite pending legal status or ongoing parental duties, reports New York Post.Steve Rios remained uncertain about what will happen next. “They might get sent back. They might not. The only person that knows is up there,” he said.",A US Marine’s father was deported and his mother detained after both were arrested by federal immigration officials.

US President Donald Trump on Wednesday said that Israeli forces could return to Gaza on his command if Hamas compromises the ceasefire deal.Trump said that he could deploy the IDF “as soon as he says the word” if Hamas fails to follow through on the ceasefire agreement, reports CNN.“What’s going on with Hamas – that’ll be straightened out quickly,” Trump said in a brief telephone call. He was referring to accusations by Israel that Hamas has not fully complied with the agreement to hand over hostages, both living and deceased.The 20-point peace plan outlined by Trump stated, “Within 72 hours of Israel publicly accepting this agreement, all hostages, alive and deceased, will be returned.” As of Wednesday morning, all 20 living Israeli hostages had been released, while only four bodies had been returned. The Israeli military reported that one of the bodies did not belong to an Israeli hostage.“Getting those 20 hostages out was paramount,” Trump said.Violent clashes have continued in Gaza, including incidents of public executions, as Hamas confronts rival groups. Trump warned that Hamas must disarm, or “we will disarm them.” His peace plan also proposes that Hamas should have no role in governing Gaza, which would be demilitarised and monitored independently.Trump said, “I’m doing research on it,” when asked whether Hamas may be executing innocent Palestinians. “We’ll find out about it. It could be gangs plus.”When asked about the consequences if Hamas refuses to disarm, Trump said, “I think about it. Israel will return to those streets as soon as I say the word. If Israel could go in and knock the crap out of them, they’d do that.” He added that he had previously restrained the Israeli military. “I had to hold them back. I had it out with Bibi.”Trump hoped for long-term peace, noting strong international support. “Fifty-nine countries are part of this,” he said, referring to the summit in Egypt where countries signed or supported the principles of the “Trump Peace Agreement.”The MAGA leader also touched on other global issues, saying he continues to work on ending the Russian war against Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is expected to visit the White House on Friday.“I’m working hard on the Russian thing,” Trump said. “One’s been going on for three years, the other three thousand.”","US President Donald Trump said that Israeli forces could return to Gaza on his command if Hamas compromises the ceasefire deal.

Is Justin Trudeau dating Katy Perry to cope with ‘mid-life crisis’?

Former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is reportedly dating pop star Katy Perry , raising questions about whether the romance signals a mid-life crisis for the ex-leader.The Daily Mail recently shared intimate photographs of the couple on a yacht near Santa Barbara, with Trudeau wearing only a pair of jeans, Perry in a black swimsuit, and both engaging in PDA.“Dating Katy may just be Justin’s answer to going to Burning Man,” a Canadian society source told Page Six. “It’s a bit of a midlife crisis.”Trudeau resigned from office in January after a decade leading the country, following the end of his 18-year marriage to Sophie Grégoire-Trudeau in August 2023.Trudeau's relationship with Perry may be a way for him to enjoy life outside politics according to some critics. “He is sowing his oats all over again,” the society source said. “He’s free from the ties of office and his marriage.”The couple was first seen dining in Montreal in July, and Trudeau later attended Perry’s concert with his daughter, Ella-Grace.Perry also seemed to hint at her new romance during a London concert when a fan proposed on stage. She said, “No wonder I fall for Englishmen all the time — but not anymore. You know, you really should have asked me about 48 hours ago.”Furthermore, an insider told PEOPLE that “when Katy first hung out with Justin, she wasn’t looking to date, but they stayed in touch.They have many shared interests and a lot to talk about, but Katy was navigating too many things to even think about dating then.”According to the source, the ex-Canadian PM “even flew to California to see her during a tour break. They have an easy connection. She finds him attractive. He’s been very respectful,"" the PEOPLE's source added.Neither Perry nor Trudeau has publicly confirmed their relationship.","Former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is reportedly dating pop star Katy Perry.

Poll Which action do you believe would be most beneficial for lasting peace between Pakistan and Afghanistan? Increased military presence Diplomatic discussions





Clashes between neighbours Pakistan and Afghanistan continue, with fresh reports emerging early Wednesday from a remote northwestern region in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. State-run media in Pakistan accused Afghan troops of opening “unprovoked firing” that was repulsed.Pakistani forces responded, reportedly damaging Afghan tanks and military posts, according to Pakistan TV and two security officials who spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media.“Afghan Taliban and Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan opened unprovoked fire in Kurram. Pakistani Army responded with full force and intensity,” reported state broadcaster PTV News, quoting security sources on X.According to Dawn, Taliban regime posts suffered heavy damage and a tank caught fire after being hit, with Taliban fighters fleeing from their positions. A later report added: “Another post and tank position of the Afghan Taliban destroyed in Kurram sector.”Tahir Ahrar, a deputy police spokesperson in Afghanistan’s Khost province, confirmed the clashes but provided no further details.This marks the second time this week that both sides have exchanged fire along their long shared border.Pakistan’s state-run media reported that Afghan forces and Pakistani Taliban jointly opened fire at a Pakistani post “without provocation,” prompting what the media described as a “strong response” from Pakistani troops in Kurram, a district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.Security officials also said Pakistan’s military destroyed a sprawling training facility of the Pakistani Taliban.There was no immediate comment from Pakistan’s military, which has been on high alert since Saturday when both sides traded fire across multiple border regions, resulting in dozens of casualties on each side.Although the clashes paused on Sunday after appeals from Saudi Arabia and Qatar, all border crossings between Pakistan and Afghanistan remain closed.Over the weekend, Kabul said it targeted several Pakistani military posts, killing 58 Pakistani soldiers in retaliation for what it called repeated violations of Afghan territory and airspace. Pakistan’s military reported lower figures, saying it lost 23 soldiers and killed more than 200 “Taliban and affiliated terrorists” in retaliatory fire along the frontier.Tensions have remained high since last week, when the Taliban government accused Pakistan of carrying out airstrikes in Kabul and in an eastern market. Pakistan has not acknowledged those allegations.Pakistan has previously launched strikes inside Afghanistan, saying it targets hideouts of Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a group separate from but allied with the Afghan Taliban.Pakistan accuses Kabul of harbouring the group, which has carried out numerous deadly attacks inside Pakistan. Kabul denies the charge, saying it does not allow its territory to be used against other countries.","State-run media in Pakistan accused Afghan troops of opening “unprovoked firing” that was repulsed.

VIDEO: Hamas Fighters Release Seven Israeli Hostages From Gaza Amid Loud Cheer From Palestinians





Hamas published a video on Monday showing eight blindfolded and kneeling men being executed in the streets, branding them ""collaborators and outlaws.""The footage surfaced amid armed clashes between Hamas security units and Palestinian clans, on the fifth day of a US-brokered truce between Israel and the militant group.Hamas proceeded to take control of Gaza on Tuesday, even as US President Donald Trump vowed to disarm the group under a recently brokered ceasefire.The Israeli military confirmed that the remains of four more hostages held in Gaza were handed to the Red Cross, following the release of four others and the safe return of 20 surviving captives.In northern Gaza, as Israeli forces withdrew from Gaza City, Hamas’s black-masked police resumed street patrols. Hamas’s Brigades helped control crowds when freed prisoners arrived in Gaza on Monday. A new Hamas security unit, called the Deterrence Force, has been targeting armed clans and gangs, some of which are said to have Israeli support.Hamas has dominated Gaza since 2007 after defeating rival faction Fatah. Israel insists Hamas must not play any role in a future Gaza government, hand back the remains of 24 deceased hostages, and eventually disarm.Trump has warned that those who refuse to surrender their weapons will be forcibly disarmed. The US-brokered 20-point peace plan, endorsed by world powers at a Trump-led summit in Egypt, demands a demilitarised Gaza and no leadership role for Hamas.Meanwhile, Israeli families continued pressing for the return of the remains of 24 hostages still held by Hamas.The Israeli army confirmed four more bodies were transferred to the Red Cross and on their way to custody. The military identified two victims as Guy Iluz, an Israeli national, and Bipin Joshi, an agriculture student from Nepal. Two others were later named as Yossi Sharabi and Daniel Peretz.Trump celebrated the ceasefire during a visit to Jerusalem with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and later joined regional leaders in Egypt to sign a declaration aimed at cementing the truce.","Hamas published a video showing eight blindfolded and kneeling men being executed in the streets, branding them ""collaborators and outlaws"" The footage surfaced amid armed clashes between Hamas security units and Palestinian clans, on the fifth day of a US-brokered truce between Israel and the militant group.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124561949,imgsize-395662,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

'BRICS Was Attack On US Dollar': Donald Trump Blasts India, China, Russia Amid Tariffs. Here's Why

Poll Do you think BRICS’ growing influence could impact global trade dynamics? Yes No





US President Donald Trump on Wednesday detailed his tariff strategy against Brics , claiming the bloc was “against the dollar” and saying countries were “dropping out.”“I told anybody who wants to be in Brics, that's fine, but we're going to put tariffs on your nation,” Trump said. “Everybody dropped out. They're all dropping out of Brics. Brics was an attack on the dollar and I said, you want to play that game, I'm going to put tariffs on all of your products coming into the US. They said, like I said, we're dropping out of Brics...They don't even talk about it anymore.”Just days earlier, India had urged Brics nations to uphold the multilateral trading system and adhere to international law - a move seen as a pushback against the protectionist measures promoted by Trump’s MAGA-driven America. The appeal risks fresh friction with a US President increasingly vocal in his hostility towards the non-Western economic grouping.Trump has repeatedly attacked Brics in the past, portraying it as a challenge to US economic dominance. The grouping, originally formed by Brazil, Russia, India, and China, has now expanded to ten full members: Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, UAE, and Indonesia.Ten others are partner states -- including Belarus, Bolivia, and Malaysia -- while another ten, such as Pakistan and Sri Lanka, have applied for membership.The rapid expansion of Brics has rattled Washington. Trump has cast it as a direct threat to the dollar’s global reserve status, insisting the bloc was “set up to hurt us” and to “degenerate our dollar.”Even as New Delhi clarified that it does not support de-dollarisation, Trump issued a fresh warning -- threatening a 100 percent tariff on Brics nations if they pursued that path.","'BRICS Was Attack On US Dollar': Donald Trump Blasts India, China, Russia Amid Tariffs.

LOS ANGELES: A University of Southern California graduate student who police say is a serial sexual predator has been charged with drugging and raping multiple women as investigators look for additional victims, Los Angeles authorities said.Sizhe Weng, a 30-year-old Chinese national also known as Steven Weng, was arrested August 28, though the district attorney and police just released statements about the case on Wednesday.Weng has pleaded not guilty to eight felony counts including forcible rape and sodomy by controlled substance or anesthesia, according to the LA County District Attorney's Office.Weng was held without bail and could not be reached for comment. A lawyer for him could not be found, and the LA Public Defender's Office didn't respond to an email asking if one of its attorneys is representing Weng.USC said in a statement Wednesday that it is cooperating fully with police and has taken steps to bar Weng from campus.""Providing a safe environment for learning, teaching, and research is our top priority,"" the statement said.Detectives began investigating in January after receiving information from authorities about a potential suspect who plied women with drugs before raping them in Los Angeles, police said in a statement.""Evidence was recovered at Weng's residence that corroborated his involvement in drug facilitated sexual assaults of multiple victims dating back to 2021 and continuing into 2025,"" the police statement said. Investigators said Weng put unspecified incapacitating drugs in his victims' food or drinks.Weng first enrolled as a doctoral student at USC in 2021, prosecutors said.District attorney Nathan Hochman urged any other potential victims to contact the police department's Robbery-Homicide Division.""We want every victim to know that their voices matter and we will fight to ensure you are heard,"" Hochman said in a statement.If convicted as charged, Weng faces 25 years to life plus 56 years in state prison, the DA's office said.","Sizhe Weng, a 30-year-old Chinese national also known as Steven Weng was arrested August 28.

Iran Blasts ‘Hypocrite’ Trump; Says He Can’t Be ‘President Of War & Peace’ At Same Time





NEW DELHI: In a striking echo of his predecessor, US President Donald Trump on Wednesday made an embarrassing gaffe as he confused India with Iran. Twice.While repeating his rant about negotiating a ceasefire between New Delhi and Islamabad, he referred to India as Iran, calling it a nuclear nation.Trump claimed he threatened both nations with 200% tariffs if the conflict blew up into a full-fledged war.""If you look at Pakistan and Iran -- I told them I was in the midst of negotiating a trade deal with Iran and Pakistan, and because of tariffs, they wanted to negotiate much differently. I heard they were shooting at each other, and then I said during one of my conversations, ""Are you guys going to go to war?” I said, 'Here’s a deal — you go to war, and I gotta put a 200% tariff and stop you from doing any business in the United States'. I said this to both of them, and within 24 hours, the war ended. That would have been a nuclear war .""Trump continues to blow a ""ceasefire"" trumpet despite India rejecting his claims and PM Modi firmly stating in Parliament that no global leader asked India to stop the attack.Sharing new details about India's Operation Sindoor in Lok Sabha, PM Modi said that US Vice President JD Vance had called him on May 9, to inform him about a 'huge' impending strike by Pakistan.""On the night of 9th May, the Vice President of America tried to talk to me. He tried for an hour, but I was in a meeting with my army, so I could not pick up his call. Later, I called him back.

A US federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Donald Trump administration from laying off federal employees amid the ongoing government shutdown.Judge Susan Illston described the planned cuts as ""illegal"" and ""exceeding authority."" During a Wednesday hearing in San Francisco, she pressed the assistant US attorney to justify the more than 4,100 layoff notices sent across eight government agencies, despite furloughed workers lacking access to their work emails and HR support.“It is very much ready, fire, aim on most of these programmes, and it has a human cost that cannot be tolerated. The evidence would ultimately show the cuts were illegal and in excess of authority,” Illston remarked, according to The Associated Press.The restraining order was issued in response to a petition from the American Federation of Government Employees and other federal labour unions, who sought to block both new and previously issued layoff notices.The shutdown, which began on October 1, entered its third week amid a stalemate between the Republicans and Democrats. Democratic lawmakers are demanding that any funding deal include healthcare provisions, while House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican, warned the shutdown could become the “longest in history” and said he “will not negotiate” until Democrats pause their demands.Lawmakers are seeking an extension of healthcare subsidies first introduced in 2021 and renewed a year later, as well as a reversal of Medicaid cuts included in Trump’s recent tax and spending legislation.","Judge Susan Illston described the planned cuts as ""illegal"" and ""exceeding authority"" She pressed the assistant US attorney to justify the more than 4,100 layoff notices sent across eight government agencies.

A federal judge on Wednesday temporarily blocked the Trump administration from firing federal workers amid the ongoing government shutdown.The decision came as the shutdown entered its third week.US district judge Susan Illston in San Francisco said the planned job cuts were being carried out without proper consideration. “It’s very much ready, fire, aim on most of these programs, and it has a human cost,” she said. ""It’s a human cost that cannot be tolerated.""Trump defended the actions, saying, “Programs favoured by Democrats are being targeted and they’re never going to come back, in many cases.”Judge Illston granted a temporary restraining order after labour unions argued that the administration’s layoff notices were illegal and designed to pressure Congress. The American Federation of Government Employees and other unions sought to block both new layoffs and those already issued, claiming the firings were an abuse of power aimed at punishing workers.The Trump administration had begun issuing notices last week to reduce the size of the federal workforce, affecting more than 4,100 employees across eight agencies. The moves targeted programmes in health, education, and special services while continuing payments to the military and pursuing immigration enforcement.Democratic lawmakers have insisted that any deal to reopen the government must address health care demands, including extending subsidies introduced in 2021 and reversing Medicaid cuts in Trump’s recent tax and spending bill. Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said the shutdown could become the longest in US history, adding he “won’t negotiate” until Democrats pause their demands.The administration argued in court that the temporary funding lapse does not eliminate Congress’ authorisation of agency programmes and that the court lacks jurisdiction over federal employment decisions.","US district judge Susan Illston in San Francisco said the planned job cuts were being carried out without proper consideration. “It’s very much ready, fire, aim on most of these programs, and it has a human cost,” she said.

How did the accused react?



What role does Trump play here?







A cluster of leaked Telegram messages has revealed a disturbing side of Young Republicans.The chats exposed racist, antisemitic, and violent exchanges among several state-level leaders who frequently invoked Nazi references, racial slurs, and threats to political rivals.The chats were obtained by POLITICO and span more than seven months and involve leaders from Young Republican groups across New York, Kansas, Arizona, and Vermont.Over 2,900 pages of messages were reviewed, containing more than 28,000 posts filled with slurs such as “fa---t,” “re----d,” and “n--ga,” which appeared more than 250 times in total.In the group, named “RESTOREYR WAR ROOM,” members frequently used racial slurs, glorified violence, and joked about Nazi gas chambers.Peter Giunta, then chair of the New York State Young Republicans, was among the most vocal ones, sending messages such as “I love Hitler” and “everyone that votes no is going to the gas chamber.”Another member, Kansas Young Republicans’ vice chair William Hendrix, repeatedly used racial slurs like “n--ga” and “n--guh,” while Bobby Walker, the New York State Young Republicans’ vice chair at the time, referred to rape as “epic.”The chat often made fun of minorities. In one exchange, Giunta dismissed Black athletes by saying, “I’d go to the zoo if I wanted to watch monkey play ball.” He also called Black people “the watermelon people.” In another instance, Hendrix joked about “watermelon and kool aid.”The chat also included a message from Alex Dwyer, Kansas Young Republicans chair, claiming that “Missouri doesn’t like f--s,” and making light of Nazi imagery.The group frequently invoked white supremacist symbols. Dwyer once replied “1488” when asked to guess a hotel room number — a code widely used by neo-Nazis that refers to “14 words” and “Heil Hitler.”After POLITICO began making inquiries, several members faced repercussions. Hendrix was removed from his role in Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach’s office, while another member had a job offer rescinded.Giunta later apologised, saying, “I am so sorry to those offended by the insensitive and inexcusable language found within the more than 28,000 messages of a private group chat that I created during my campaign to lead the Young Republicans.” He also claimed the chats might have been “deceptively doctored.”Walker, now the chair of the New York State Young Republicans, also issued an apology, saying, “There is no excuse for the language and tone in messages attributed to me. The language is wrong and hurtful, and I sincerely apologise.”The chat’s members often discussed Trump’s influence as the MAGA chief. “Trumps too busy burning the Epstein files,” Dwyer wrote, referencing the late pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.Surprisingly, some members appeared aware of the potential fallout. “If we ever had a leak of this chat we would be cooked fr fr,” Walker wrote in one message.Their fears have now come true. The revelations have triggered outrage across the GOP, with calls for resignations and disciplinary action.","Leaked Telegram messages reveal racist, antisemitic, and violent exchanges among several state-level leaders.

What’s really going on in the Katy Perry-Trudeau love story? Source reveals duo ‘are definitely into each other’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/whats-really-going-on-in-the-katy-perry-trudeau-love-story-source-reveals-duo-are-definitely-into-each-other/articleshow/124583312.cms,"A 'supersized attraction'







Pop star Katy Perry and former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau ’s rumoured romance seems to be hitting all the right notes, with sources saying the duo is “definitely into each other.”A Canadian insider told PEOPLE that the pair are “quite taken with each other” and share a mutual respect along with an intellectual bond. “In addition to the attraction, they are both smart and love to talk about serious issues,” the source said.The romance is said to have started in July 2025, when Perry, 40, and Trudeau, 53, were first spotted together in Montreal for a stroll, drinks, and dinner. This came a month after Perry’s split from actor Orlando Bloom and two years after Trudeau ended his 18-year marriage to Sophie Grégoire. Two nights after their initial outing, Trudeau attended Perry’s Montreal concert.A source close to the singer said that when Perry first went out with Trudeau, she was not looking to date, but the pair stayed in touch. “They have many shared interests and a lot to talk about, but Katy was navigating too many things to even think about dating then,” the insider revealed. Trudeau reportedly pursued the connection actively, even flying to California to see Perry during a tour break. “They have an easy connection.She finds him attractive. He’s been very respectful,” the source said.The pair's recent yacht photos, released by the Daily Mail, have gone viral. The images, taken aboard Perry’s 24-metre yacht off Santa Barbara, show the duo engaging in visible PDA. The images, even though blurry, reveal hugging, kissing, and intimate gestures, including Trudeau placing a hand on Perry's bottom.According to a source close to Trudeau, the couple have been taking things slowly due to their busy schedules. Perry is on her Lifetimes World Tour, which continues through December, while Trudeau has family obligations in Canada. “They have stayed in touch since the middle of summer but haven’t been able to spend that much time together, due mainly to her schedule,” the source said.“Justin thinks she is terrific. It has had time to develop on a friend and intellectual level as well as supersized attraction. The romance has merit,” the insider added.Perry appeared to acknowledge the dating rumours during a London tour stop when a fan held up a sign saying, “I heard you're single.” She replied, “You heard I was single? That's interesting.” Neither Perry nor Trudeau has publicly commented on the status of their relationship.Perry shares a five-year-old daughter, Daisy Dove, with Bloom, and was previously married to comedian Russell Brand. Trudeau shares three children—Xavier, 18, Ella-Grace, 16, and Hadrien, 11—with ex-wife Grégoire.","Katy Perry and former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau are rumoured to be dating.

"Tellis tale isn't a tell-all; FBI affidavit charges him with unlawful retention of classified info, not espionage",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/tellis-tale-isnt-a-tell-all-fbi-affidavit-charges-him-with-unlawful-retention-of-classified-info-not-espionage/articleshow/124583333.cms,"Ashley Tellis

TOI correspondent from Washington:





The American think-tank community is in shock this week after the US justice department accused Ashley Tellis, a respected Indian-American scholar, of unlawful retention of national defense information and undocumented meetings with Chinese officials.Tellis, 64, a naturalized US citizen and senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, was charged via a criminal complaint filed Monday following an FBI search that allegedly uncovered over a thousand pages of documents marked TOP SECRET and SECRET stored in his home.The charging document - an affidavit filed by FBI special agent Jeffrey Scott - details how Tellis, who holds a top secret clearance with sensitive compartmented information (SCI) access, allegedly removed highly sensitive materials from secure government facilities.SCI access is a formal authorization for individuals to handle specific US classified information. Individuals with SCI access are often required to sign a lifelong nondisclosure agreement and are restricted to working within specific sensitive compartmented information facilities (SCIFs).According to the affidavit, the FBI investigation began after video surveillance captured Tellis engaging in “concerning activity” at two separate secure facilities in September and October 2025.In one instance, the affidavit details repeated attempts by Tellis to print hundreds of pages of documents, including several classified SECRET/ NOFORN (not releasable to foreign nationals) pages concerning US air force tactics, techniques, and procedures and military aircraft capabilities. He also allegedly re-saved a file titled ""Econ reform"" that contained highly classified information before printing specific page ranges.The affidavit states that on October 11, 2025, a federal court authorized a search warrant for Tellis’s residence in Vienna, Virginia, the same day he was scheduled to depart for planned international travel to Rome, Italy.The affidavit also documents several meetings Tellis had with Chinese government officials between September 2022 and September 2025, raising questions about potential information compromise.In one instance, on September 15, 2022, surveillance allegedly observed Tellis entering the restaurant with a manila envelope and departing without it, while the PRC officials entered with a gift bag. In another instance, on September 2, 2025, the PRC officials reportedly handed Tellis a red gift bag near the end of the dinner.The conversations at these dinners, according to the affidavit, touched on sensitive topics like Iranian-Chinese relations, emerging technologies (AI), and US-Pakistan relations, all areas of expertise for Tellis.The charges against Tellis stunned members of the strategic affairs community, many of whom have had constructive engagements with a well-regarded scholar even when they have disagreed with him. Some analysts even went so far as to argue that meeting Chinese officials, as the justice department affidavit alleged, was par for course in the strategic thinkers community.“My good friend Ashley Tellis may have been careless with classified documents (though less than the current US president) but meeting with Chinese officials is part of his f**cking job,” Bruno Tertrais, a scholar with the French thinktank FRS, wrote on X.In the thinktank circuit, the broad consensus was Tellis may have erred in handling classified information, but calling him a Chinese spy – which the affidavit implies but does not say directly – would be a stretch. If anything, he had long been advising Washington and New Delhi that they need to work together to deal with a rising China.Mishandling classified or top secret documents is an old and familiar story in Washington DC. Among those accused of it more recently: Joe Biden, and before him, Donald Trump.After he demitted office in 2020, then former President Trump was charged in a federal criminal case with willful retention of national defense information and other charges related to storing classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago residence.Biden’s own personal attorneys discovered classified documents from his time as Vice President at the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement and his private residence in Wilmington, Delaware. Former vice-president Mike Pence was also accused of taking away classified documents.While they were unscathed because of the privilege of high office, others like former national security advisor Sandy Berger and CIA chief general David Petraeus, had to face consequences.After he was accused of intentionally concealing and removing a classified report detailing the Clinton administration's internal assessments of the unsuccessful 2000 millennium attack plots, Berger pled guilty in 2005 to one count of unauthorized removal and retention of classified material. He was fined $50,000 and sentenced to two years of probation with 100 hours of community service. His security clearance was revoked for three years and he was later disbarred from practicing law.In another case, former US general David Petraeus was charged with providing eight binders of classified material, which he called his ""black books,"" to Paula Broadwell, who was writing his biography, All In: The Education of General David Petraeus, and with whom he was allegedly in a relationship. The fallout from the affair and subsequent FBI investigation led to his resignation as CIA Director in November 2012. He was later sentenced to two years of probation and ordered to pay a $100,000 fine.In yet another case, former assistant secretary of state Robin Raphel was also accused of being in possession of classified documents that should not have been removed from the state department. The counterintelligence investigation was reportedly triggered after US investigators intercepted a conversation where a Pakistani official claimed their government was receiving US secrets from a prominent former state department diplomat. Raphel refused a plea deal for mishandling classified documents and the case was later dropped.While none of these cases resulted in proven charges of espionage, social media lynchmobs, including hypernationalists in India and in the US, had a field day jumping to conclusions about Tellis, ostensibly based on his writings.Two recent pieces by Tellis in Foreign Affairs magazine offended India partisans: A May 2023 piece headlined “America’s Bad Bet on India” that explained why New Delhi would not side with Washington against Beijing, a common-enough discussion in think-tank circles.In a more recent piece, provocatively headlined “India’s Great Power Delusions,” Tellis argued that India overestimates its influence on the world stage while lacking the economic heft, military capacity, and alliances to back its great-power ambitions. He warned that India’s attachment to strategic autonomy and multipolarity risks making the country irrelevant in an era of intensifying bipolarity, when the competition between China and the United States will shape geopolitics.Neither piece appeared to suggest even remotely that he was shilling, much less spying, for China.After alluding to possible exchanges of manila envelops and red gift bag, the FBI concluded its affidavit saying it ""establishes probable cause in support of a criminal complaint charging Ashley Tellis with the unlawful retention of national defense information.""","Ashley Tellis, 64, is a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

Pakistan and Afghanistan agreed to a 48-hour temporary ceasefire beginning Wednesday evening, following a week of intense cross-border hostilities that left dozens dead on both sides and significantly strained already fragile bilateral ties, reported Pakistan daily Dawn.The Pakistan foreign office (FO) confirmed the development, stating that the truce was arranged “with the mutual consent of both parties” at the request of the Afghan Taliban regime.“During this period, both sides will make sincere efforts to find a positive solution to this complex but solvable issue through constructive dialogue,” the FO said, as quoted by the daily.Also read: Fierce Pakistan-Afghanistan border clash rages on; fresh visuals show intense shelling - Top developments The announcement came hours after Pakistan carried out precision strikes targeting key Taliban positions in Kandahar and Kabul, in response to attacks from Afghan territory that reportedly killed 23 Pakistani soldiers and injured 29 others, according to the military’s media wing, inter-services public relations (ISPR).Afghan Taliban government spokesperson echoed Islambad's stanmce on ceasefire but contrdicted on what might have led to it, stating: ""At request of Pakistani side, a ceasefire between the two countries will take place this evening.""

The ISPR stated that the Taliban launched coordinated attacks at four points, which were “effectively repulsed” by Pakistani forces. Around 15–20 attackers were killed, it added.The Afghan side has described the attacks as “retaliatory”, accusing Islamabad of conducting airstrikes in its territory. Tensions have worsened amid repeated Pakistani accusations that terrorist groups use Afghan soil to launch attacks inside Pakistan. Kabul denies these claims, stating that its territory is not being used for such purposes.On Monday, Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif told Geo News: “It’s a stalemate right now. You can say there are no active hostilities, but the environment is hostile… There are no ties, direct or indirect, as of today.” He also warned that hostilities could resume “at any time.”","Pakistan and Afghanistan agreed to a 48-hour temporary ceasefire beginning Wednesday evening.

Pakistan has secured a $1.2 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund .

NEW DELHI: Former Indian diplomat KP Fabian on Sunday described Pakistan’s foreign policy as a “failure” following its recent confrontation with Afghanistan, where Islamabad has been accused of carrying out strikes on Afghan territory.Speaking to news agency ANI, Fabian said Pakistan had acted as an aggressor and “played its hand badly,” resulting in deteriorating relations with Kabul.“This has happened when, maybe coincidentally, the Afghanistan Emirate foreign minister is in Delhi,” Fabian said, as per ANI.“The bad relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan cannot entirely be explained on the basis of the Durand Line. I think Pakistan played its hand badly, probably was overbearing. The proud Afghans resisted, and now the relationship is very bad,” he said.Fabian noted that Pakistan had carried out strikes on Kabul, prompting Afghanistan’s retaliation.“On the whole, Pakistani policy has been, more or less, a failure... It is abundantly clear that Afghanistan is keen on developing relations with India, which is the case with India too, and Pakistan is naturally upset,” he added.The Afghan ministry of defence has recently said that the armed forces of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan conducted “successful retaliatory operations” against Pakistani military positions along the Durand Line late Saturday night.In a statement cited by ANI, the ministry said the strikes were “in response to repeated violations of Afghanistan’s sovereignty by the Pakistani military and airstrikes on its territory.”According to news agency Associated Press (AP), Afghanistan claimed on Sunday that its forces had killed 58 Pakistani soldiers and captured 25 military posts in overnight operations along the border.Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said Afghan forces were in control of the “official borders and de facto lines,” though Pakistan has not confirmed any casualties.Both the Torkham and Chaman border crossings remained closed on Sunday following the escalation. Pakistan, for its part, accused Afghan authorities of harbouring militants of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a charge Kabul has denied.Tensions between the two countries have worsened in recent months, with frequent border skirmishes and airstrikes deepening distrust. Saudi Arabia has called for “restraint and dialogue” to prevent further escalation in the region.","Former Indian diplomat KP Fabian on Sunday described Pakistan’s foreign policy as a “failure” following its recent confrontation with Afghanistan.

PESHAWAR: Seven policemen were killed and 13 others injured in a terrorist attack at a police training centre in Pakistan 's restive Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, the army said on Saturday.The attack took place late Friday night when seven to eight terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) launched a coordinated assault using heavy weapons on the Dera Ismail Khan Police Training Centre in the DI Khan district, near the South Waziristan border.On the intervening night of October 10-11, terrorists attempted to breach the perimeter of the police training school by ramming an explosives-laden truck into its main gate, triggering a massive explosion, the army said in a statement.While one policeman was killed in the attack, six others died in the retaliatory exchange of fire between the security personnel and the terrorists.After the intense five-hour engagement, six terrorists were also eliminated, the army said.During the exchange of fire, the militants continued throwing hand grenades.A mosque inside the institute complex was targeted by the terrorists. The Imam of the mosque was killed in the attack.Around 200 trainees, instructors, and staff members were present at the training school during the attack, police said.Thirteen people, including police personnel, were also injured in the attack, they said.According to officials, all trainee recruits and staff members were safely evacuated to secure locations.Earlier in the day, the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) in a statement said the office of the National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) near the training centre was also burnt down by terrorists.Inspector General of Police Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Zulfiqar Hameed, confirmed that the area has been completely cleared.Pakistan continues to reel under terrorism with overall violence surging by 46 per cent in the third quarter of 2025, a media report said last week.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was the worst-hit region, suffering nearly 71 per cent (638) of the total violence-linked fatalities, and over 67 per cent (221) of the incidents of violence, followed by Balochistan, with over 25 per cent of fatalities (230) and incidents (85).Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terrorist attacks, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, predominantly targeting the police, law enforcement agencies' personnel, and security forces.",Seven policemen were killed and 13 others injured in a terrorist attack at a police training centre in Pakistan's restive Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

Pakistan Panics After Taliban Issues Warning, Accuses India of Using Afghanistan Soil for Terror





Pakistan has lodged formal objections with Afghanistan’s Ambassador in Islamabad over several ‘elements of the India‑Afghanistan joint statement’, particularly the reference to Jammu and Kashmir as 'part of India'.It also rejected remarks by Afghan foreign minister Mawlawi Amir Khan Muttaqi that “terrorism is an internal problem of Pakistan,” the Pakistani ministry of foreign affairs (MOFA) said.The foreign office said: “It was conveyed that the reference to Jammu and Kashmir as part of India is in clear violation of the relevant UN Security Council resolutions and the legal status of Jammu and Kashmir. The Joint Statement is highly insensitive to the sacrifices and sentiments of the people of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir in their just struggle for the right to self‑determination.”In addition, Islamabad strongly rebutted Muttaqi’s claim, saying: “Pakistan has repeatedly shared details regarding the presence of Fitna‑e‑Khawarij and Fitna‑e‑Hindustan terrorist elements operating from Afghan soil against Pakistan with support from elements within Afghanistan.”The Pakistani statement added that deflecting responsibility by branding terrorism in Pakistan as an ""internal matter"" does not relieve Afghanistan’s interim government of its duty to ensure regional peace and security.It also urged that “unauthorised Afghan nationals residing in Pakistan” return to their country.These protests follow a joint statement issued on October 10 during Muttaqi’s visit to India, where both nations reiterated condemnation of terrorism emanating from regional countries, affirmed respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, and affirmed that the Afghan government would not permit any group or individual to use Afghan territory against India.In that statement, external affairs minister S Jaishankar expressed gratitude for Afghanistan’s condemnation of the April 22 terrorist attack in Pahalgam, Jammu & Kashmir, while Afghanistan reaffirmed its support in counterterrorism.""Both sides emphasised respect for each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The external affairs minister appreciated the Afghan side's understanding of India's security concerns. The Afghan foreign minister reiterated the commitment that the Afghan government will not allow any group or individual to use the territory of Afghanistan against India,"" the statement issued by the ministry of external affairs (MEA) read.Muttaqi is on a week-long visit to India (October 9–16), the first such high-level visit since the Taliban takeover in 2021. Earlier, he said the “future of India‑Afghanistan relations seems very bright.”",Pakistan has lodged formal objections with Afghanistan’s Ambassador in Islamabad over several ‘elements of the India‑Afghanistan joint statement’ It also rejected remarks by Afghan foreign minister Mawlawi Amir Khan Muttaqi that “terrorism is an internal problem of Pakistan’,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124491584,imgsize-1282370,width-400,resizemode-4/shehbaz-sharif-left-amir-muttaqi-and-s-jaishankar-file-agencies.jpg"

Strategic recalibration: Delhi steps in

Strategic hedging, not endorsement







NEW DELHI: In a diplomatic manoeuvre that could reshape regional equations, India announced on Friday that it will upgrade its technical mission in Kabul to a full-fledged embassy. The decision was announced during Taliban foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi’s high-profile visit to New Delhi. On the same day, the Afghan foreign minister, from Indian soil, condemned Pakistan for bombing civilian areas in Paktika, Afghanistan — the first of its kind that came against the backdrop of escalating tensions between Kabul and Islamabad.During the meetings, external affairs minister S Jaishankar underlined that India’s engagement “contributes to Afghanistan’s national development, as well as regional stability and resilience,” while announcing a fresh round of development projects across Afghan provinces. The upgrade of India’s technical mission to a full-fledged embassy signals a significant deepening of diplomatic ties without extending formal recognition to the Taliban regime.Later the same day, Muttaqi held a press briefing in New Delhi, sharply condemning Pakistan for bombing civilian areas in Paktika, calling it a “provocative act” and a violation of Afghanistan’s sovereignty. “Such issues cannot be resolved by strength.Countries with disputes should resolve them internally. Peace and prosperity are good for all,” he said, stressing the widening rift between Kabul and Islamabad.India had shut its Kabul embassy in August 2021 after the Taliban’s return to power, maintaining only a skeletal presence through a technical team since June 2022 to oversee humanitarian aid. The embassy upgrade marks the deepest level of engagement between India and the Taliban since the fall of the Ashraf Ghani government. This move stops short of formal recognition but signals a decisive shift in India’s Afghanistan strategy.The timing of the announcement was significant. It came just hours after Afghanistan’s defence ministry accused Pakistan of bombing civilian areas in Paktika near the Durand Line. “Pakistan violated Afghanistan’s airspace, bombing a civilian market in the Marghi area of Paktika near the Durand Line and also violating Kabul’s sovereign territory,” the ministry said in a post on social media. Calling it “an unprecedented, violent, and provocative act”, Kabul warned that defending its territory is its right.From Indian soil, Muttaqi chose to respond sharply. “I think it’s a wrong step by the Pakistan government. Such issues cannot be resolved by strength. Countries with disputes should resolve them internally. Peace and prosperity are good for all,” he told reporters in Delhi. “Some attacks happened in border areas, and we condemn them. We have opened doors for dialogue and diplomacy.”The unusually strong language stressed the widening rift between the Taliban and Pakistan, their uneasy patron for decades. Relations have deteriorated over Islamabad’s military operations against Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) fighters allegedly sheltering in Afghanistan. In March 2024, Pakistani airstrikes in Khost and Paktika killed several civilians, triggering warnings from Kabul of “consequences”. This fracture, analysts say, has created a new strategic opening for India.India has historically had a fraught relationship with the Taliban. During the 1990s, New Delhi backed the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance while Islamabad openly supported the Taliban regime. After 2001, India became one of Afghanistan’s largest regional donors, pledging over USD 3 billion for development projects. But the Taliban’s return to power in 2021 disrupted India’s presence and leverage in the country. New Delhi maintained limited contact, focusing on humanitarian assistance and regional coordination with Iran and Central Asian partners.Now, with Pakistan–Taliban ties fraying, India is recalibrating. By reopening its embassy, hosting Muttaqi, and accepting Taliban-appointed diplomats (though not at the ambassadorial level), India is signalling a willingness to engage without granting formal recognition. Strategic analysts describe this as “hedging” — positioning itself to gain influence should Pakistan’s grip weaken further, while safeguarding its own security concerns.Professor Rajan Kumar of the School of International Studies at Jawaharlal Nehru University says this evolving situation presents India with a rare diplomatic opening.“The ongoing conflict with Afghanistan and Pakistan certainly offers an opportunity for India can be a stabilising factor even in the ongoing conflict with Pakistan. India’s presence matters a lot to Afghanistan because it will provide some kind of legitimacy to the Taliban government, even though India is unlikely to recognise the regime as such,” he says.The engagement carried clear economic undertones as well. Muttaqi invited Indian companies to invest in Afghanistan’s mining sector and called for the opening of the Attari–Wagah border for direct India–Afghanistan trade. “Pakistan and India should open the Wagah border to facilitate trade between Afghanistan and India. It will benefit the people of all three countries,” he said.Currently, India trades with Afghanistan primarily via Iran’s Chabahar port due to Pakistan’s denial of overland access. But the route faces uncertainty after the United States revoked India’s sanctions waiver for Chabahar in September 2024, complicating transit. While Chabahar remains a strategic hedge, its operational limitations make direct India–Afghanistan connectivity via Pakistan attractive in theory — though politically fraught.India also announced a new slate of development projects: a Thalassemia Centre and 30-bed hospital in Bagrami district, oncology and trauma centres in Kabul, maternity clinics across Paktika, Khost and Paktia, and donations of ambulances, medical equipment and vaccines. These announcements draw on India’s legacy of over 500 development projects across all 34 Afghan provinces, including the Parliament building and the Salma Dam.Security remains at the core of India’s engagement. Without naming Pakistan, both sides “unequivocally condemned all acts of terrorism emanating from regional countries” in their joint statement. Jaishankar said, “We have a common commitment towards growth and prosperity. However, these are endangered by the shared threat of cross-border terrorism that both our nations face. We must coordinate efforts to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.” Muttaqi, meanwhile, pledged that Afghanistan “won’t allow any group to use the country against others”, identifying Daesh (ISIS) as the main regional threat.For India, the key is ensuring Afghan soil is not used for anti-India activities — a core concern since the IC-814 hijacking in 1999. Prof. Kumar explains this strategic bottom line:“What can happen, and what India is probably thinking, is that the land of Afghanistan may not be used for terrorist activities against India. That would be a huge achievement from the Indian perspective,” he says.India has so far avoided pressing the Taliban hard on human rights. Muttaqi remained vague when asked about women’s rights, saying, “All countries have their own customs and traditions and these should be respected.” While India has consistently raised rights issues at multilateral forums, officials have avoided making them a precondition for engagement.Perhaps the most consequential element of India’s strategy is its decision to reopen its embassy in Kabul without formally recognising the Taliban regime — a nuanced diplomatic line that gives New Delhi both flexibility and leverage. By restoring a physical diplomatic presence, India can deepen engagement on the ground and signal its relevance in Afghanistan’s evolving power dynamics, without extending official legitimacy to a government that remains internationally unrecognised and controversial for its human rights record.This approach reflects a clear distinction between establishing an embassy and granting diplomatic recognition. India has previously maintained similar diplomatic arrangements, such as with Palestine, where the presence of an embassy does not automatically translate into full diplomatic recognition of a government. In the Afghan context, this allows India to engage pragmatically while aligning its policy with the broader stance of the United Nations, the European Union and Western countries, most of which have opted for functional engagement without recognition.By doing so, New Delhi positions itself strategically. It can build channels of communication, potentially shape outcomes on critical security and connectivity issues, and apply pressure on regional actors like Pakistan and China, both of which are wary of India expanding its influence in Afghanistan. At the same time, India avoids prematurely endorsing a regime whose policies on women’s rights and governance remain at odds with international norms.India’s outreach is also informed by broader regional considerations. Russia and China have already established working relationships with the Taliban. Western governments are engaged in dialogue on counterterrorism and aid. New Delhi, analysts say, does not want to be the outlier.As Prof. Kumar notes, “Since Russia is talking, China is already there, and American and Western governments are also talking, India should not be left out. We may have ideological differences with the Taliban regime, but since other countries are talking to the Taliban in different forms, we should also try to moderate our policy and engage on several issues.”This balancing act is not without challenges. The Taliban regime remains ideologically rigid, especially on women’s rights and governance. Connectivity through Chabahar faces geopolitical headwinds. And there is no guarantee that the Taliban will limit anti-India groups indefinitely. Yet, by opening formal diplomatic channels, India aims to secure a seat at the table rather than watch from the sidelines as others shape Afghanistan’s future.Muttaqi’s visit to Delhi, marked by strong rhetoric against Pakistan, overtures for trade, and assurances on terrorism, reflects Kabul’s attempt to diversify its diplomatic bets. For India, the outreach is less about endorsing the Taliban regime and more about strategic positioning: insulating itself against security risks, reasserting influence in a region long dominated by Pakistan, and adapting to a shifting geopolitical landscape.New Delhi’s approach remains cautious but deliberate. It is engaging the Taliban to pursue its security and strategic objectives, without abandoning its normative concerns or rushing into recognition. In the complex triangle of India–Afghanistan–Pakistan, this marks the beginning of a new phase — one where India is no longer merely reacting to developments in Kabul, but actively shaping them.","India announced on Friday that it will upgrade its technical mission in Kabul to a full-fledged embassy.

Government response and TLP’s history





Massive protests by the hardline Islamist groupescalated into violent clashes across multiple cities on Friday and Saturday, leaving at least 11 people dead and dozens injured. Demonstrators marched towards Islamabad in what they called a “Gaza March” to express solidarity with Palestinians and planned to stage a protest outside the United States embassy.TLP launched its protests in Lahore on Thursday, announcing plans to march to the US embassy in Islamabad to oppose the US-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Hamas following two years of conflict in Gaza. While the demonstrations were initially organised to challenge the ceasefire, the party said the focus had shifted to expressing solidarity with Palestinians.“We have no demands other than showing solidarity with the people of Gaza,” senior TLP member Allama Muhammad Irfan told AFP as the protesters set off for Islamabad.The rally, led by TLP chief Saad Rizvi, began after Friday prayers from the party’s base on Multan Road in Lahore. Thousands joined, chanting religious slogans and carrying sticks and rods. Police set up barricades and used tear gas at key junctions — including Yateem Khana Chowk, Chauburji, Azadi Chowk, and Shahdara — but protesters broke through, clashing with security forces and pelting stones.Videos on social media showed demonstrators seizing government vehicles and damaging public property.Violence soon spread to Islamabad and Rawalpindi, where authorities placed shipping containers to block roads and fired tear gas to disperse crowds. In return, protesters hurled stones at police. Public life in the twin cities was severely disrupted, with schools shut, the Metro bus service suspended, and mobile internet blocked for a second consecutive day.According to Arab News, TLP claimed that 11 of its supporters had been killed and 50 injured since Thursday, though officials have not commented on the claim. Lahore police confirmed multiple injuries among officers and said more than 100 TLP activists had been arrested for attacking law enforcement and damaging property.Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi warned that no group would be allowed to march on Islamabad “under any circumstances,” while State Minister for Interior Talal Chaudhry accused the TLP of “political blackmail” and misusing religious sentiments. “Peaceful protest is a democratic right,” Chaudhry said, “but there is no room for violence or mob pressure.”Founded in 2015, the TLP has a history of staging disruptive protests on religious and political issues. Since its rise in 2017, the group has repeatedly brought parts of Pakistan to a standstill through mass marches and sit-ins that have paralyzed the capital and major highways for days.",Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) launched protests in Lahore on Thursday.

At Least 24 Killed As Pakistan Air Force Bombs Tirah Village In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa





The Pakistani Taliban, also known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), claimed responsibility for a series of deadly attacks on Friday across northwestern districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, killing 20 security personnel and three civilians.As per news agency AFP, the coordinated assaults included a suicide bombing at a police training school in Dera Ismail Khan district, along with clashes in other districts bordering Afghanistan.Eleven paramilitary troops were killed in the Khyber district, while seven policemen died when a suicide bomber drove an explosives-laden vehicle into the gate of the Dera Ismail Khan police training school, followed by an armed assault.“Seven police personnel were martyred and 13 were injured in the attack, while six terrorists were also killed,” Muhammad Hussain, a senior local police official, was quoted as saying by AFP.In Bajaur district, five people—including three civilians—were killed during clashes between militants and paramilitary forces, AFP reported.Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif strongly condemned the attacks, saying, “Such cowardly acts by terrorists cannot shake our resolve against terrorism.We are determined to completely eliminate terrorism from the country.”Islamabad has accused Afghanistan of allowing militants to operate from its territory, a claim denied by Kabul. Pakistani defence minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif warned, “Everyone will have to bear the consequences, including those providing the hideouts. Enough is enough”, adding that any response could cause collateral damage.Friday’s attacks reflect a surge in militancy in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa since the US-led troop withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021.As per news agency AP , the assault on the police training school in Ratta Kulachi on Friday involved heavy weapons and lasted nearly six hours.Around 200 recruits and trainers were inside during the attack, and officers returned fire, preventing mass casualties. Six militants were killed in the operation, along with the seizure of suicide vests, explosives, and weapons.Security forces have faced rising threats this year, with over 500 people, including 311 troops and 73 police officers, killed in militant attacks from January to mid-September, according to AFP.The TTP, though allied with the Afghan Taliban, operates independently and remains a major threat along Pakistan’s northwestern border.","The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for a series of deadly attacks across northwestern districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

Riots Erupt As Pro-Palestine Protests Explode Globally, Cops Battle ‘Israel Haters’ In Major Cities





LAHORE: Violent clashes erupted Friday between police and Islamists in Pakistan 's eastern city of Lahore after security forces tried to stop thousands of demonstrators from leaving for the capital, Islamabad, where they planned to stage a pro-Palestinian rally outside the US Embassy, officials said.The clashes in the capital of Punjab province began Thursday but intensified Friday after police baton-charged the demonstrators and fired tear gas to disperse them at multiple locations. Protesters hurled stones at officers in response.In a statement, the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan party, or TLP, claimed that two of its supporters had been killed and 50 others injured since Thursday. There was no immediate comment from the Punjab provincial government, which is headed by Punjab chief minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif, the niece of the prime minister.The protest comes after Hamas and Israel agreed to a ceasefire plan brokered by US President Donald Trump.Speaking to thousands of worshippers in Lahore at Friday prayers, TLP chief Saad Rizvi announced the march, saying, ""We will now march from Lahore to the US Embassy"" in Islamabad.He said: ""I will walk at the head of the long march. Arrest is not a problem, bullets are not a problem, shells are not a problem - martyrdom is our destiny.""Police officers were swinging batons and firing tear gas to disperse demonstrators near the main TLP office, according to witnesses, who said residents also faced severe difficulties because of the tear gas.The violence has disrupted daily life in parts of Lahore, as residents struggled to reach home because of road closures and continued clashes.On Friday, authorities shut schools, colleges and universities in Lahore, a city of more than 14 million people.The government of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has suspended mobile internet service in Islamabad and nearby Rawalpindi as part of measures aimed at preventing demonstrators from reaching the national capital.Authorities have also placed shipping containers along the main motorway, the main highways and roads leading to Islamabad to block protesters.Lahore is about 350 kilometers (210 miles) from Islamabad.The U.S. Embassy in Islamabad issued a security alert ahead of the march, warning of possible disruptions and urging American citizens to exercise caution.""Large crowds and traffic congestion are expected, along with a precautionary security presence, an increased number of checkpoints, and associated disruptions to local mobile and internet networks in the region,"" the embassy said, adding that the duration of the protests is unknown.It advised U.S. citizens to avoid large gatherings, remain aware of their surroundings and keep a low profile.Deputy Interior Minister Talal Chaudhry said Thursday that the TLP had not submitted a request for permission to hold the rally. The group denied the claim, saying it had applied for permission for a peaceful march to express solidarity with Palestinians.The TLP, known for staging disruptive and sometimes violent protests, has drawn criticism online. But many users have accused the government of overreacting by blocking roads even before the demonstrators began their march.""Why are these demonstrators coming to Islamabad for the rally when the peace process has already started in Palestine?"" asked Mohammad Ashfaq, 35, as he turned back from a road block in Islamabad.He said he tried using longer routes to reach the city, but police had also blocked those roads with shipping containers.

Pakistan Panics After Taliban Issues Warning, Accuses India of Using Afghanistan Soil for Terror





ISLAMABAD/KABUL: Afghanistan's Taliban government accused Pakistan on Friday of carrying out airstrikes on its territory and warned of ""consequences"" as Islamabad said it was taking action against militants.

India Spreading False Narratives About Hindu Attacks in Bangladesh: Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus





DHAKA: Bangladesh chief adviser Muhammad Yunus has said India will probably continue hosting former PM Sheikh Hasina if given a ""free choice"", while claiming that ""some external forces"" want her to come back, days after New Delhi asserted that matters related to the Awami League leader are ""legal"" in nature and require ""consultations"" between both nations.The Nobel laureate also stressed that the interim govt - formed after Hasina's ouster last year following massive protests - is ""very alert"" about communal harmony, as he dismissed as ""fake news"" reports of attacks against the minority Hindu community in his country. Yunus said that his message to them, when he meets the community's leaders, ""is don't go back and say, 'I'm a Hindu, so protect me'... always say, 'I'm a citizen of this country. I'm entitled to all the protection the state is supposed to give me"".Talking on the issues related to Hasina and his conversations with PM Narendra Modi in an interview with Mehdi Hassan of online media outlet Zeteo, Yunus said, ""Two things: first, I said you want to keep her, I can't tell you what to do with her but make sure she doesn't talk about us. She doesn't talk about the Bangladeshi people.""Dhaka had sought Hasina's extradition in Dec last year and there has been no development yet.""Probably they (India) will keep her. If some legal obligation is there that they cannot avoid, then the situation will be different,"" he said. They have been supporting her all along, Yunus said. The chief adviser added that those who are behind her hope that she will come back in Bangladesh, ""with full glory of returning as a victorious leader"", claiming that ""some external forces are supporting her to come back"".When Mehdi noted that ""last Nov, around 30,000 Hindus in Bangladesh gathered to protest against your govt, claiming there have been thousands of attacks on their community. (US President) Donald Trump called the violence in Bangladesh 'barbaric',"" Yunus said, ""One of the specialities about India right now is fake news, a barrage of fake news."" ""This is fake news. You can't go by this fake news,"" he said.Asked if he was saying the reports were exaggerated, or if there's no anti-Hindu violence, Yunus said there is ""some conflict sometimes, some family problem, land problem and something"". ""You happen to be my neighbour. You are a Hindu neighbour. I am a Muslim neighbour. We have a problem with our land demarcation, just like two neighbours. So you said this is Hindu-Muslim. That's not it,"" he said.","Bangladesh chief adviser Muhammad Yunus says India will probably continue hosting former PM Sheikh Hasina if given a ""free choice"" Yunus claims that ""some external forces"" want her to come back, days after New Delhi asserted that matters related to the Awami League leader are ""legal""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124511935,imgsize-380223,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-7.jpg"

The TTP’s deadly resurgence



What next for Pakistan and the Taliban?



(With inputs from agencies)





Afghanistan and Pakistan have once again found themselves on the brink of open conflict after days of deadly cross-border fighting that exposed the fragility of their long and volatile frontier. Afghan officials said their forces killed 58 Pakistani soldiers in overnight “retaliatory operations,” while Islamabad gave a far lower death toll of 23, describing the attacks as “unprovoked” adding that it killed 200 Taliban fighters.The exchanges, centred along the 2,600-kilometre Durand Line (which Afghanistan has never recognised), follow accusations by Kabul that Pakistan bombed Afghan territory including: Strikes on Kabul and a market in the country’s east. Pakistan has neither confirmed nor denied involvement, but Afghan Defence Ministry spokesman Enayatullah Khwarazmi said, “Our armed forces are fully prepared to defend the nation’s borders and will deliver a strong response. ”The border tension has disrupted the Torkham crossing, a vital trade route, and triggered alarm in the Gulf. Saudi Arabia and Qatar have urged restraint, calling for dialogue to “maintain the security and stability of the region.”Afghan foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, currently in India, denied Islamabad’s accusations that the Taliban harbour members of Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan ( TTP ), a banned militant group behind recent deadly attacks inside Pakistan.“There is no presence of TTP in Afghanistan now,” he told reporters. “They are Pakistani people from displaced areas and are allowed to live in the country as refugees. The border is more than 2,400 km long—it could neither be controlled by ‘Changez’ nor ‘Angrez’. Strength alone cannot control it. This fight is inside Pakistan.”Muttaqi accused Islamabad of failing to “take its people into confidence” and of “endangering its own people to please a few.” But he warned that Kabul would act if provoked further: “We want a peaceful resolution of the situation, but if the peace efforts don’t succeed, we have other options.”For decades, Pakistan was considered a patron of the Taliban, providing shelter and support since the group’s emergence in the 1990s.Pakistan has supported the Taliban since their inception, initially backing the anti-Soviet mujahideen who later formed the group. In the 1990s, Islamabad was one of only three nations to recognise the Taliban regime and was the last to cut ties in 2001. After the US invasion, Pakistan helped the Taliban regroup, offering safe havens and medical aid, which allowed the movement to endure despite heavy battlefield losses.Islamabad hoped that the Taliban’s return to power in 2021 would secure its western flank and curb cross-border militancy. Instead, it has seen a resurgence of attacks.However, with the war over, the Taliban no longer relies on Pakistan for sanctuaries or wartime support. Now, it focuses on gaining legitimacy at home, where distrust of Pakistan runs deep. “By lashing out at Pakistan, the Taliban hopes to buy some goodwill from the Afghan public,” Michael Kugelman, the director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center, told Time.comAnalysts say Pakistan’s influence over the Taliban has eroded sharply. “Taliban leaders no longer need refuge across the border or Pakistani assistance,” wrote Foreign Policy, noting that the leverage Islamabad once enjoyed “is at risk of being lost.” The Taliban’s reluctance to act against the TTP reflects not just ideological affinity but also domestic priorities: distancing themselves from Pakistani control helps their pursuit of legitimacy at home.“Pakistan finds itself in a predicament largely of its own making—the Taliban leadership that it supported throughout much of the 20-year insurgency in Afghanistan is now sheltering militant groups targeting Islamabad,” Joshua White, a professor in international affairs at Johns Hopkins University, told Time.com in July last year.The TTP, listed by the United Nations as an al-Qaeda-linked terrorist organisation since 2011, aims to overthrow Pakistan’s government and impose its own strict interpretation of Islamic law. With an estimated 30,000 to 35,000 members, the group has waged a bloody campaign for nearly two decades, killing hundreds of soldiers, police, and civilians.Pakistan’s military campaigns including: Operations Zarb-e-Azb and Radd-ul-Fasaad. once splintered the group, pushing its leaders into Afghanistan. But the Taliban’s victory in Kabul re-energised the TTP, which has since reunited its factions and ramped up attacks. According to the Pak Institute for Peace Studies (PIPS), violence in Pakistan in 2024 returned to levels last seen in 2015.A UN report in July 2025 claimed the TTP enjoys “logistical and operational support” from Taliban authorities, a claim Kabul denies. Islamabad, under pressure from growing domestic insecurity, has launched cross-border airstrikes on suspected TTP hideouts and expelled over a million Afghan refugees since last year.“The inability of the Taliban administration to take concrete action against the TTP has significantly strained relations,” Islamabad-based analyst Tahir Khan told Deutsche Welle. “Unless the issue of the TTP is effectively addressed, meaningful improvement in bilateral ties will remain elusive.”The violence along the Durand Line has once again shown how Pakistan’s decades-long strategy of nurturing militant proxies for influence in Afghanistan has backfired. The very groups it once supported are now undermining its internal security.Pakistan’s interior minister Mohsin Naqvi has accused Afghan forces of firing on civilians, warning that “no provocation will be tolerated.” Islamabad’s retaliatory strikes have reportedly destroyed multiple Afghan border posts and militant camps, though the Taliban claim to have seized several Pakistani outposts in return.Both sides remain locked in a dangerous cycle of provocation and denial. Kabul insists the TTP problem is “a fight inside Pakistan,” while Islamabad continues to demand action. Yet neither seems willing to take the political or military risks required for a lasting peace.Until that reckoning comes, the Durand Line will remain what it has always been: not a border of control, but a fault line of crisis.","Afghanistan and Pakistan have once again found themselves on the brink of open conflict after days of deadly cross-border fighting.

Boris Johnson former aide Dominic Cummings claims China ‘stole’ UK state secrets — and Whitehall buried it,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/boris-johnson-former-aide-dominic-cummings-claims-china-stole-uk-state-secrets-and-whitehall-buried-it/articleshow/124582916.cms,"Driving the news



Why it matters



The big picture



What was stolen:

Duration of breach:

Official cover-up:

Economic vs security priorities:

Political fallout:

Bottom line:





Boris Johnson’s former chief adviser Dominic Cummings has made explosive claims that China compromised Britain’s most secure data systems for years, stealing vast amounts of top-secret information — and that senior officials covered it up.Cummings, one of the most influential figures in Johnson’s Downing Street, alleged that a breach of the UK government’s highest-level classified data network — known as the “Strap” system — allowed Beijing to harvest “extremely secret and extremely dangerous” information over a prolonged period.He said he and Johnson were first informed of the breach in 2020, and that they were warned disclosing details could be a criminal offence. The stolen material, he claimed, included intelligence agency data, documents from the National Security Secretariat, and other highly sensitive state secrets.“It was so bizarre that people in the room thought they must have misheard,” Cummings told The Times, describing the meeting where the breach was disclosed. “Vast amounts of data classified as extremely secret were compromised.”If accurate, the breach represents one of the most significant national security failures in modern British history — potentially exposing intelligence operations, diplomatic strategies, and critical infrastructure vulnerabilities to a foreign power.Cummings alleges that the Cabinet Office prioritised protecting relations with Beijing over confronting the breach publicly, arguing that “the British state has prioritised Chinese money over its own security for decades.” He claimed that even current ministers, including Prime Minister Keir Starmer, may be unaware of the full extent of the compromise.The revelation comes amid deep political fallout from the collapse of a high-profile Chinese espionage prosecution. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) dropped charges against two men accused of spying for Beijing after the government declined to officially state that China was a “threat” to national security at the time of the alleged offences.The “Strap” system — the UK’s highest classification level — was reportedly compromised. This includes intelligence data, Cabinet Office secrets, and sensitive state material.According to Cummings, the network transferring the UK’s most sensitive data was infiltrated “for years.”Cummings claims senior officials warned those informed not to discuss the breach with the media, with some evidence deliberately “buried.”He accuses successive governments of downplaying threats from China to protect trade and investment ties.The allegations coincide with Starmer’s decision to publish witness statements linked to the collapsed spy trial — documents that could shed light on the government’s stance on Chinese espionage.Cummings’ claims, if substantiated, point to a systemic failure of Britain’s national security apparatus and raise profound questions about how successive governments have balanced security risks against economic interests with China. They also put renewed pressure on Prime Minister Starmer to fully disclose the scale of Beijing’s infiltration and the British state’s response.","Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson’s former chief adviser, makes explosive claims that China compromised Britain’S most secure data systems for years.

Gaudoin says Thatcher had an affair “very early” in her time as an MP, though no names are given. With Humphrey Atkins: Rumours of a later affair with Atkins, who served as chief whip and Northern Ireland secretary, circulated in Westminster. Aitken said his “good looks might have appealed to her, but his political brain was hopeless.”

The Bell connection:

Denis’s friendship with Rice-Davies:

Reactions:

Legacy and perception:

Bottom line:





A new book has thrown one of Britain’s most mythologised political marriages into the spotlight, alleging that Margaret Thatcher — the first female prime minister and conservative icon — had two extramarital affairs during her career.In The Incidental Feminist, journalist Tina Gaudoin claims that Thatcher was involved in two affairs: one early in her career as a Conservative MP and another later with Sir Humphrey Atkins, a senior party colleague and chief whip under Edward Heath. Gaudoin says multiple sources, including former Tory minister Jonathan Aitken, confirmed “knowledgeable rumours” of the relationships.The book also details an “extracurricular friendship” between Thatcher and Lord Tim Bell, her long-time PR adviser, as well as a close friendship her husband Denis later developed with Mandy Rice-Davies — a key figure in the 1963 Profumo scandal.For decades, Thatcher’s marriage to Denis was presented as one of rock-solid partnership and mutual devotion — a stabilising force behind her meteoric political rise. She famously described him as “the golden thread running through my life.”If Gaudoin’s claims are true, they would complicate one of the most carefully curated political images of the 20th century and shed new light on the private life of a leader whose public persona was defined by discipline and conviction.PR chief Lord Tim Bell reportedly had a flirtatious relationship with Thatcher, with anecdotes of knee-touching at dinners. Gaudoin notes there is no evidence this went beyond physical familiarity.After Thatcher left Downing Street, Denis struck up an affectionate friendship with Rice-Davies, exchanging letters and even holidaying together.Charles Moore, Thatcher’s authorised biographer, dismissed the allegations as “vanishingly unlikely” and said he had seen no evidence. Nevertheless, the claims reignite long-standing rumours about the Iron Lady’s private life.Gaudoin argues that Thatcher, despite rejecting the feminist label, helped “normalise female power.” Even her detractors, she says, often disliked her simply because of who she was, not what she achieved.Whether these alleged affairs were real or merely Westminster gossip, they challenge the myth of Margaret Thatcher as the steely, sexless “Iron Lady” and suggest a more complex, human figure — one whose charisma, power, and personal life were far more intertwined than the public ever knew.","Journalist Tina Gaudoin claims Thatcher was involved in two affairs.

Only Hindu temple in East of England faces closure threat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/only-hindu-temple-in-east-of-england-faces-closure-threat/articleshow/124561089.cms,".





LONDON: The only Hindu temple in East of England, which serves 13,500 Hindus, is at risk of closure because the local authority has put the building it is in up for sale.The Bharat Hindu Samaj Temple was established in the New England Complex in Peterborough in 1984 and serves Hindus in Cambridgeshire, Norfolk and parts of Lincolnshire.Peterborough City Council owns the building and wants to sell it to pay off debts.The temple put in its bid by the deadline of Monday night to buy the entire complex of seven units.Kishor Ladwa, president of the temple, said it had a bid of £1.3 million for the complex agreed in April with the council offering a £504,000 discount for the social value of its services. Then, in Sept, the council said it had other buyers and could not offer them the complex for that amount and asked them to increase their bid. The council has not disclosed who the other bidders are but indicated they are community organisations.“We don’t want to be someone’s tenant. The council never sent us a legally binding contract to buy the site. We would have signed it immediately,” Ladwa said. “We have been negotiating to buy the temple for 14 years but the council keeps shifting its goalposts.”The temple is an important social hub for the elderly, offering luncheons twice a week, and dementia and diabetic workshops.It also offers Bollywood dance, yoga, Zumba, Hindi and Gujarati classes. “Some of the elderly are lonely and this is the only social place to meet their own friends,” Ladwa said.There was a huge week-long procession when the idols were consecrated there, so how can they be moved if they have to go to another site, he asks.Ekta Patel, tempe vice-president, said: “We are saving the council millions of pounds in public services through the activities we are providing for the elderly. We don’t want to be in a situation where someone can evict us.”Petitions have sprung up garnering thousands of signatures calling for the sale to be stopped.Councillor Mohammed Jamil, cabinet member for finance and corporate governance at the council, said: “We understand that this must be a worrying time for the Hindu community. However, we have to put all community assets we have identified to sell on the open market to ensure we achieve the best possible value for taxpayers. If the Bharat Hindu Samaj is not the preferred bidder, responsibility for its tenancy would transfer to the new owner, and they would continue to have rights and protections under the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1954, but would need to seek their own legal advice. ”","The Bharat Hindu Samaj Temple was established in the New England Complex in Peterborough in 1984.

Malaysia's jailed ex-PM Najib to argue appeal for house arrest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/malaysias-jailed-ex-pm-najib-to-argue-appeal-for-house-arrest/articleshow/115857686.cms,"Najib Razak (AP file photo)

KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia's jailed ex-leader Najib Razak will begin his defence this week against graft charges tied to more than $500 million in alleged bribes, and argue to serve the rest of his sentence under house arrest.The former prime minister, already serving a six-year jail term for corruption related to the plunder of sovereign wealth fund 1MDB, faces several other cases linked to the financial scandal that led to his defeat in 2018 elections.At the High Court on Monday, the 71-year-old will start his defence against four counts of abuse of power linked to 2.27 billion ringgit ($510 million) in alleged bribes and 21 counts of money laundering.The case involves Tanore Finance Corp, which US authorities have said was used to siphon money from 1MDB.Najib issued an apology in October that the 1MDB scandal happened during his tenure, but maintained he had no knowledge of illegal transfers from the now-defunct state fund.If convicted, Najib faces hefty fines and sentences of up to 20 years for each count of abuse of power.Najib's lead lawyer, Muhammad Shafee Abdullah, has said they were ""more determined"" than ever to fight the case.- Bid for house arrest -Separately, the Court of Appeal will on Thursday hear Najib's challenge against a lower court's refusal to hear his request for house arrest.His application for a judicial review centres on the purported existence of an order by the former king, granting him permission to serve the rest of his sentence at home.Najib asked the court to compel the government to confirm the royal decree's existence and to implement its order.But the court ruled in July that affidavits supporting Najib's claim were inadmissible as evidence, because they were hearsay.The supposed document has not been made public and there has been no comment from the former king, whose term in the largely ceremonial role ended in January.If the appeals court rules in Najib's favour, the case will go back to the lower court.There has also been speculation he could benefit from a proposed law allowing house arrest as an alternative punishment for select offences next year.Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim's government has denied the bill was tailored to get Najib out of jail.Andrew Khoo, a lawyer in Kuala Lumpur, said Najib faces an uphill battle in his bid for house arrest, as he was sentenced for a serious offence.""It would send the wrong message to the public at large that even those convicted of serious offences can serve their jail sentence from home,"" he told AFP.- Superyacht and art -Allegations that billions of dollars were pilfered from investment vehicle 1MDB and used to buy everything from a superyacht to artwork played a major role in prompting voters to oust Najib and the long-ruling United Malays National Organisation party in the 2018 elections.The 1MDB scandal sparked investigations in the United States, Switzerland and Singapore, whose financial systems were believed to have been used to launder the money.The US Justice Department has said more than $4.5 billion was stolen from 1MDB between 2009 and 2015 by high-level officials at the fund and their associates.Najib began serving a 12-year jail term in August 2022 for offences linked to the misuse of public money from former 1MDB unit SRC International. The sentence was later halved by Malaysia's pardons board.Since then, Najib has won some legal victories.On November 27, a Malaysian court allowed corruption charges in one of the five cases linked to 1MDB to be dropped against him.Those charges were related to payments of more than $1 billion allegedly made to Abu Dhabi's International Petroleum Investment Company.Another charge of audit tampering ended with an acquittal in 2023.",Malaysia's jailed ex-leader Najib Razak will begin his defence against graft charges this week. Najib is already serving a six-year jail term for corruption related to the plunder of sovereign wealth fund 1MDB. The 71-year-old faces four counts of abuse of power linked to 2.27 billion ringgit ($510 million) in alleged bribes.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115857717,imgsize-1238149,width-400,resizemode-4/115857717.jpg"

Biden's Thanksgiving holiday is part of a longer farewell as Trump's return to White House nears,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/bidens-thanksgiving-holiday-is-part-of-a-longer-farewell-as-trumps-return-to-white-house-nears/articleshow/115857220.cms,"President Joe Biden talks to the media during a visit to Nantucket fire department on Thanksgiving day in Nantucket Mass., Thursday, Nov. 28, 2024. (AP)

NANTUCKET: Joe Biden is wrapping up his final Thanksgiving holiday as president on Nantucket, a family tradition that this year seems to be part of a broader farewell to his time in the White House.The Democrat's four years as president will be bookended by Republican Donald Trump, whose Cabinet nominations, tariff threats and glitzy evenings at Mar-a-Lago, his Florida club, have captured the public's attention since the November election. Biden dropped out of the presidential contest in July and was replaced on the ticket by Vice President Kamala Harris, who lost to Trump.During his five days on the Massachusetts island, with its picturesque wood shingle homes and sea-shelled beaches, the 82-year-old Biden was still dealing with questions of his legacy. He returned to Washington late Saturday and will leave for Angola the next day for his only visit to Africa as president.On Friday, as Biden and his family walked along the quaint brick sidewalks and cobblestone streets that have made Nantucket a wealthy and desirable summer vacation spot, passersby shouted ""We love you, Joe."" The Biden contingent included the president's daughter, Ashley, and son, Hunter, as well as Hunter's 4-year-old son, Beau.Over the past year, Biden has called Trump's falsehoods about the government's hurricane relief ""un-American"" and repeatedly warned that the incoming president could undermine U.S. democracy and foreign alliances.But when asked by reporters on Thanksgiving Day what he was thankful for, Biden said: ""I'm thankful for a peaceful transition of the presidency.""Biden also said he was thankful for his family, the new cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon and the potential for more progress in the Middle East. The president, who has largely avoided reporters' questions lately, engaged on a number of matters related to Trump and policy.He suggested that ""razor-thin"" margins of power for Republicans in the next Congress will mean that Trump will have to accept ""some real compromise"" as he pushes his agenda.""I think there may be a little bit of internal reckoning,"" Biden said.Biden also said he hoped Trump would ""rethink"" his tariff threats against Mexico and Canada, leading American trading partners.""We're surrounded by the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, and two allies: Mexico and Canada,"" Biden said. ""And the last thing we need to do is begin to screw up those relationships. I think we've got them in a good place.""Days earlier, Trump had pledged on on his social media site, Truth Social, to impose 25% tariffs on both countries until they stopped illegal immigration and blocked the flow of drugs across their border with the United States. The threat caused Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum to engage Trump in a phone call and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to fly to Florida on Friday to meet with him.After that phone call, Trump claimed in a post to be ""effectively closing our Southern Border,"" a statement that Sheinbaum disputed even as she expressed confidence the tariffs would be averted. Mexico has already taken steps to address the issues raised by Trump - a point also raised by Biden.Trudeau left Florida on Saturday without a commitment by Trump to avoid tariffs. Trump called the meeting ""productive.""Trump has also threatened an additional 10% tariff on China unless it stops exporting materials used to make the drug fentanyl.Biden told reporters that Chinese President Xi Jinping understood the value of avoiding any missteps in relations with the United States.""The one thing I'm confident about Xi is he doesn't want to make a mistake,"" Biden said. ""And I'm not saying that he is our best buddy, but he -- he understands what's at stake.""On Thanksgiving Day, Biden went to a fire station to deliver pumpkin pies with his wife, Jill, and grandson Beau. The first lady told firefighters and police officers that the family has been going to Nantucket for Thanksgiving since 1975, an outing the family has come to call ""nana-tucket"" in a nod to her central role in establishing the tradition.The firefighters gave the Bidens a pair of baseball caps.The president put his on and asked his grandson, ""What do you think?""""It looks good,"" said the grandson, who demurred when the president asked him if he would like to be a firefighter.On Friday, the Biden family lunched at the Brotherhood of Thieves restaurant and stopped at Nantucket Bookworks, an art gallery and several other shops. Their afternoon ended with the ceremonial Christmas tree lighting and carolers as crowds took pictures and videos of a grinning Biden.This year's holiday might carry particular emotional resonance as a respite from some family tumult.In December, Hunter Biden is scheduled to be sentenced on three felonies for purchasing a gun in 2018 when, prosecutors said, he lied on a federal form by claiming he was not illegally using or addicted to drugs. He also faces sentencing in California in December on federal tax charges he pleaded guilty to in September.The president has previously said he would not pardon his son or commute his eventual sentence.","Biden returned to Washington late Saturday and will leave for Angola the next day for his only visit to Africa as president.

Japan to prosecute dead girl after suicide attempt kills another woman,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/japan-to-prosecute-dead-girl-after-suicide-attempt-kills-another-woman/articleshow/115828179.cms,"Representative image: ANI

Japan is prosecuting a teenager who fell from the rooftop of a shopping centre and landed on a pedestrian below, resulting in the death of both, Japan Today reported.The incident occurred on August 31 this year, when a 17-year-old girl from Japan's Chiba Prefecture went to an open space on the 12th floor of the NEWoMan shopping complex above Yokohama Station. She climbed over a 2.5-meter glass barrier surrounding the public area and jumped from the building in the afternoon.The 17-year-old student landed on 32-year-old Chikako Chiba, who was walking with friends. Both were taken to the hospital, where the teenager died first, followed by Chiba about three hours later.Investigators believe the teenager’s fall was a suicide, though the reason is unclear. The teenager has been charged posthumously with ""gross negligence resulting in death"". Yokohama police said that the student was aware of the potential danger to pedestrians below.The decision to prosecute the teenager has sparked debate, with critics questioning the value of prosecuting someone who is deceased. A comment on Japan Today described the action as ""peak government ridiculousness.""Japan has the highest suicide rate among teenagers in the G7 countries and records more suicides by minors on September 1 than on any other day in the calendar year. In 2023, 513 minors died by suicide on this date, similar to 514 the year before, according to government data.Overall, 21,800 people in Japan died by suicide last year. To address the issue, the Japanese government appointed a minister for loneliness in 2021, linking the rise in suicides to the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.","A 17-year-old girl from Japan's Chiba Prefecture jumped from the 12th floor of a shopping centre and landed on a pedestrian below.

Are Harry and Meghan heading for a divorce?

As Meghan Markle has professionally separated from her husband Prince Harry intensifying rumors about their divorce, the Duchess of Sussex has asked the US authorities to give her some more time to get her lifestyle brand off the ground. Meghan will now fully focus on her career but her jam brand American Riviera Orchard could not procure a trademark because of some issues with the filing. Meghan was given three months to address the errors in the application in August. According to reports, she has now asked for another three months to correct the error in the filing and if this deadline is missed, she will have to start the application again. The application which Meghan filled early this year was not signed and she didn't send enough money, reports said.There is another firm that has the trademark Royal Riviera which challenged Meghan's trademark plea.However, it is not clear why Meghan would need three more months to set things right when her lawyers have been already working on it.Harry and Meghan are in the middle of a professional separation which means they will not work together. According to their aides, this is a decision they have jointly arrived as their joint brand 'Harry-Meghan' or the 'Sussexes' has been losing popularity.

Governor Kathy Hochul has implemented a state of emergency across multiple Western New York counties in response to significant lake effect snow conditions.The emergency declaration encompasses six counties in Western New York:AlleganyCattaraugusChautauquaErieGenesseeWyomingLake effect snow is expected throughout the weekend across portions of WNY and as of 3 pm ET on Friday, November 29.

If you're traveling: Use caution and don't crowd the plow,"" she added.Responding to a query over the impact of snow in New York, Governor Hochul said, ""Well, this is something that we're very accustomed to — these lake effect snows. I'm a Western New Yorker myself, so it's all about taking steps to be ready for the worst.

Mom accused US defence secretary pick of mistreating women,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/mom-accused-us-defence-secretary-pick-of-mistreating-women/articleshow/115855670.cms,"WASHINGTON: The mother of Pete Hegseth , Trump's pick for secretary of defense, wrote him an email in 2018 saying he had routinely mistreated women for years and displayed a lack of character. ""On behalf of all the women (and I know it's many) you have abused in some way, I say ... get some help and take an honest look at yourself,"" Penelope Hegseth wrote, stating that she still loved him.""I have no respect for any man that belittles, lies, cheats, sleeps around and uses women for his own power and ego. You are that man (and have been for years) and as your mother, it pains me and embarrasses me to say that, but it is the sad, sad truth.""Penelope Hegseth, in a phone interview with The New York Times on Friday, said that she had sent her son an immediate follow-up email at the time apologising for what she had written. She said she had fired off the original email ""in anger, with emotion"" at a time when he and his wife were going through a very difficult divorce.In the interview, she defended her son and disavowed the sentiments she had expressed in the initial email about his character and treatment of women. ""It is not true. It has never been true,"" she said. She added: ""I know my son. He is a good father, husband."" She said that publishing the contents of the first email was ""disgusting.""Questions about Pete Hegseth's treatment of women have emerged in the weeks since Trump chose him, a veteran of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, to lead the Pentagon. The issue could be a subject of scrutiny during Senate confirmation hearings .Reports of his infidelity have focused attention on his character and leadership, particularly for a civilian overseeing the military, where active-duty service members can be subject to prosecution for adultery under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.Another issue is how the senators will view a rape complaint against Hegseth filed to police in Oct 2017 after an incident at a political conference in Monterey, California. No charges were ever brought and the complainant has not come forward publicly. Hegseth has said he was falsely accused by a woman with whom he had a consensual sexual encounter. He secretly paid her a settlement a few years later - only because, according to his lawyer, he wanted to protect his job as weekend anchor at Fox & Friends.Penelope Hegseth emailed her son on April 30, 2018, during a turbulent period in his life. He was in the middle of a contentious divorce from his second wife, Samantha, the mother of three of his children. Samantha Hegseth filed for divorce after her husband impregnated a co-worker, part of a pattern of adultery that dated back to his first marriage.Pete Hegseth's mother wrote in the email that she was upset about his treatment of Samantha, writing: ""For you to try to label her as 'unstable' for your own advantage is despicable and abusive. Is there any sense of decency left in you?""""She did not ask for or deserve any of what has come to her by your hand,"" she said.""Neither did Meredith,"" Penelope Hegseth added, referring to his first wife.Hegseth forwarded a copy of her email to Samantha the same night she sent it to her son. The NYT obtained a copy of the email from another person with ties to the Hegseth family.

The two companies have denied the suit's claims.In response to the Canadian lawsuit, a spokesperson for OpenAI said, ""We have not yet had the opportunity to review the allegations,"" but added ""our models are trained on publicly available data, grounded in fair use and related international copyright principles that are fair for creators and support innovation.""The Canadian outlets, which include the Globe and Mail , are seeking what could add up to billions of dollars in damages.

Kamala Harris faces criticism over post-election fundraising blitz,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kamala-harris-faces-criticism-over-post-election-fundraising-blitz/articleshow/115852562.cms,"File photo: US Vice-President Kamala Harris (Picture credit: AP)

Weeks after her election defeat, Vice President Kamala Harris continues to solicit donations through frequent fundraising emails. Critics claim the aggressive approach is alienating supporters while raising questions about her campaign’s financial management.Emails from Harris’ team, dubbed the "" Harris Fight Fund ,"" have urged donors to contribute immediately, warning of the urgent need to counteract President-elect Donald Trump’s nominations and policies.According to the New York Post, one email received chastised recipients, stating, “Our records show that you haven’t pitched in yet. We know the election didn’t turn out as we’d hoped, but we’re not backing down.”Harris' campaign, which raised $1.5 billion over 15 weeks, ended with an alleged $20 million in debt, according to insiders cited by Politico. However, Harris’ team disputes these claims.Critics, including Democratic strategist Jon Reinish, argue that the non-stop appeals are “galling” and potentially damaging to the party. “Getting fundraising requests after a candidate has lost, especially when they’re millions in debt, is insulting,” The New York Post quoted Reinish.The Harris campaign’s spending choices have also come under scrutiny. Notable expenditures included $1 million to Oprah Winfrey’s Harpo Productions, $900,000 for advertising on the Las Vegas Sphere, and millions on private jets and luxury hotels.Over half a billion dollars was channelled to four media consulting firms.James Carville, a longtime Democratic insider, called for an audit of Harris’ campaign finances. “When you have an airplane crash, you don’t just move on. You investigate what went wrong,” The New York Post quotes him. Carville also added that detailed scrutiny is required beyond Federal Election Commission disclosures.Some Democrats fear Harris’ fundraising tactics could alienate small-dollar donors, a key pillar of the party's funding. “This kind of tone erodes trust,” Politico qouted Democratic digital strategist Mike Nellis.James Zogby, a DNC member, has also voiced concerns, describing the fundraising tone as “begging” and calling for greater financial transparency within the Democratic Party.The emails cite ongoing recount efforts and legal challenges as reasons for continued fundraising. However, the fine print reveals that most funds raised flow to the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and state-level affiliates rather than the recount account. This practice, while legal, has sparked further debate.The controversy comes ahead of the February 1 election for the next DNC chair, who will oversee the party’s financial direction post-Biden. Candidates like Minnesota DFL Chair Ken Martin and former Maryland Governor Martin O’Malley are expected to address the issue.Zogby, running for DNC vice chair, advocates for a financial oversight committee to monitor party spending. “Where does the money go, and why don’t we know where it goes?” he told Politico.Despite criticism, Harris remains active in the Democratic fundraising landscape and is reportedly considering another presidential run in 2028. For now, her campaign emails continue to ask donors to “build a foundation of resources” to hold the Trump administration accountable.","US Vice-President Kamala Harris continues to solicit donations through frequent fundraising emails.

President-elect Donald Trump ’s selection of Lori Chavez-DeRemer as Labour Secretary is drawing sharp criticism, not only for her political positions but also for her campaign spending habits.The Oregon congresswoman, who lost her re-election bid this November, reportedly spent tens of thousands of dollars on luxury hotel stays and limousine services during her campaign, raising eyebrows among her critics.According to Federal Election Commission records reviewed by The New York Post, Chavez-DeRemer’s campaign shelled out over $56,000 on hotel stays between February 2023 and October 2024.The expenses included $6,290 at the five-star Phoenician Resort in Scottsdale, Arizona, which boasts a three-level pool with a view of Camelback Mountain. Other high-profile stays included the Potawatomi Casino Hotel in Milwaukee, a Hilton in Wisconsin, and even a Miami Ritz-Carlton.In addition to hotel expenses, the campaign spent at least $4,345 on limousine and chauffeur services, with one Utah company, Snow Country Limousine, receiving $731.50. Around the same time, her campaign also spent $1,512 at the luxurious St. Regis Deer Valley resort, known for its ski-in, ski-out facilities.These revelations come as Chavez-DeRemer faces backlash from conservative Republicans, who label her a “Republican in name only” due to her support for pro-union policies.As per The New York Post, one GOP insider quipped, “All this wasteful spending, boy is she ready for the Department of Labor ,”.Chavez-DeRemer is one of the few Republicans to back the PRO Act , a union-supported bill aimed at overturning right-to-work laws in over two dozen states. The legislation, which ultimately failed, would have made it easier for workers to unionise. Her nomination is reportedly backed by Teamsters Union President Sean O’Brien, who praised her as a bridge between business and labour communities.While Trump touted her nomination as a move to empower the American workforce, her union-friendly stance has sparked divisions within the Republican Party.Critics point to her support for other controversial policies, including legislation providing pathways to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and reforms that benefit public sector workers.","Lori Chavez-DeRemer's campaign shelled out over $56,000 on hotel stays between February 2023 and October 2024.

The 'Mar-a-Lago Face' phenomenon

A heated debate has emerged over the so-called "" Mar-a-Lago face "" trend, a term used to describe the alleged cosmetic enhancements among those in Donald Trump's inner circle.The controversy escalated when Laura Loomer, a Trump supporter and far-right activist, accused DailyMail of using a photoshopped image of her in their reporting on the trend.Taking to X (formerly Twitter), Loomer slammed DailyMail for what she claimed were manipulated images aimed at discrediting her. ""This is honestly so outrageous. @MailOnline now using obviously photoshopped pictures of Trump supporters they don’t like to get clicks,"" she wrote. Loomer alleged her face had been altered in a published image and described it as part of a broader attempt to undermine Trump allies.She added, ""The child has been photoshopped with a mustache and my face has been photoshopped by Daily Mail. Is this what Daily Mail passes as 'journalism' now? Manipulating images of people they don’t like?"" Loomer also shared a recent photo to show what she claimed was her actual appearance and called for the publication to ""delete their post and practice real journalism.""The term ""Mar-a-Lago face"" has been making waves in political circles, describing an aesthetic characterised by Botox, fillers, bronzed skin, and a smooth, artificial complexion.Critics suggest this look has become common among Trump associates, including Lara Trump, Kimberly Guilfoyle, Matt Gaetz, and Kristi Noem.Michigan-based plastic surgeon Dr Anthony Youn previously told DailyMail that some of Trump's allies appeared to have undergone ""mildly to moderately overdone"" cosmetic work.Others, including San Francisco plastic surgeon Dr Corey Maas, criticised the visible effects of Botox in figures such as Gaetz, claiming it left him with ""odd and expressionless"" features. He also added that overuse of Botox in men could lead to a drooping effect, making them appear “evil.”The transformation isn’t limited to men. Lara Trump, wife of Eric Trump, has reportedly undergone significant changes, including Botox and cheek fillers, alongside skin treatments to achieve a bronzed glow.According to The Hollywood Reporter, her evolving look aligns with what has been observed in Kimberly Guilfoyle, Donald Trump Jr’s fiancée, who experts believe has overused Botox and fillers, resulting in facial asymmetry.Kristi Noem, the South Dakota governor who was nominated for Homeland Security Secretary, also caught public attention.Reports from The New York Times highlighted that Noem’s straightened teeth and polished appearance seemed part of a calculated effort to fit the aesthetic preferences of Trump’s orbit. Republican strategist Ron Bonjean commented that Noem appeared to be catering to “an audience of one,” referring to the former president.Interestingly, Trump himself reportedly disapproves of plastic surgery.As per The Atlantic, the President-elect was “disgusted” upon learning about the extent of Laura Loomer’s alleged cosmetic enhancements.However, according to The Hollywood Reporter, the broader trend of cosmetic tweaking has permeated DC across party lines, with politicians like Nancy Pelosi, Kamala Harris, and Joe Biden also rumoured to rely on aesthetic treatments.",Far-right activist Laura Loomer accused DailyMail of using photoshopped image of her in their reporting on the 'Mar-a-Lago face' trend.

‘Wave goodbye to America’: Trump threatens 100% tariffs on Brics nations over plans to replace US Dollar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/wave-goodbye-to-america-trump-threatens-100-tariffs-on-brics-nations-over-plans-to-replace-us-dollar/articleshow/115850920.cms,"File photo: US President-elect Donald Trump (Picture credit: AP)

US President-elect Donald Trump has issued a stern warning to Brics member countries and their allies, threatening to impose 100 per cent tariffs if they proceed with plans to introduce or support a currency to replace the US dollar in international trade.Trump's statement, made on his social media platform, Truth Social, on Saturday, targeted the bloc's ongoing efforts to challenge the dominance of the dollar.Trump demanded a formal assurance from the Brics nations, which include Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, alongside newer members such as Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, and the UAE.He stated, “We require a commitment from these Countries that they will neither create a new Brics currency, nor back any other currency to replace the mighty US Dollar, or they will face 100 per cent Tariffs.”He further warned that any such move would result in the countries losing access to the US economy, saying, “They should expect to say goodbye to selling into the wonderful US Economy.”Trump dismissed the possibility of the Brics nations successfully challenging the dollar's dominance, adding, “There is no chance that the Brics will replace the US Dollar in International Trade, and any Country that tries should wave goodbye to America.”At the recent Brics summit held in Kazan, Russia, discussions centred on boosting non-dollar transactions and strengthening local currencies. Russian President Vladimir Putin accused the US of ""weaponising"" the dollar, calling it a ""big mistake.""He stated, ""It's not us who refuse to use the dollar. But if they don't let us work, what can we do? We are forced to search for alternatives."" Despite this, Putin clarified that the bloc is not currently considering a unified Brics currency or creating an alternative to the ‘Swift’ payment system.The Brics bloc has been exploring ways to reduce dependency on the US dollar, discussing the creation of a shared currency to facilitate trade among member nations. This initiative has been viewed as a direct challenge to the dollar’s supremacy in global trade and finance.Proponents argue that such a currency would protect their economies from the volatility of US sanctions and monetary policies.However, reports indicate that the Brics group’s financial platforms, such as the New Development Bank and the Contingent Reserve Arrangement, currently focus on supporting sustainable development and financial stability rather than launching a unified currency.Trump’s protectionist stance has extended to other countries as well, with previous threats of 25 per cent tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, and 10 per cent tariffs on Chinese imports, aimed at addressing trade imbalances and illegal immigration.Research by the Atlantic Council indicates that the US dollar's role as the primary global reserve currency remains ""secure in the near and medium term,"" accounting for roughly 58 per cent of the world's foreign exchange reserves.Major commodities like oil also continue to be traded primarily in dollars, reinforcing its dominance despite growing calls for de-dollarisation from the Brics bloc and other developing nations.",US President-elect Donald Trump has issued a stern warning to Brics member countries and their allies.

The warrants led the NAB to dispatch a team to arrest her. Bibi currently resides in Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where Khan's political party, PTI, holds power.Both Khan and Bibi face accusations of misusing 50 billion Pakistani Rupees (190 million pounds).

ISLAMABAD: A well-known Pakistani journalist, Matiullah Jan, investigating civilian deaths in a recent assault launched by security forces against supporters of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan, has been booked in terrorism and narcotics cases in Islamabad on Thursday.Jan was picked up by unknown individuals along with another journalist, Saqib Bashir, late Wednesday night. His family said he was abducted from the parking of a hospital in Islamabad at around 11pm by “unmarked abductors in an unmarked vehicle”. Bashir, who was later released, said they were collecting data from the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) on the casualties after the march when they were taken.The incident took place amid rising tensions in the capital following Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party’s claims that more than 200 of its workers had been killed by security forces during a late Tuesday night operation to disperse Imran’s supporters in the capital. The protesters had gathered to demand the release from jail of Imran Khan and other politicians and workers of his party.On Thursday afternoon, Islamabad police booked Jan with charges related to terrorism, drug-peddling and attacking police. “It is no less than a joke.

(Reuters)

ISLAMABAD: At least eight supporters of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) were killed and dozens of others injured in Islamabad following what the party said was a sweeping crackdown overnight by security forces to disperse protesters demanding the release of jailed former prime minister and PTI chief Imran Khan Following the crackdown, Imran’s party ended its agitation but Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur addressed a press conference in his province on Wednesday saying the protest would go on. “Until Imran Khan’s call, this sit-in will go on,” he said without elaborating where it would be held. PTI has been in govt in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.Thousands of demonstrators, led by Imran’s wife Bushra Bibi, and Gandapur, had gathered in the capital on Tuesday vowing to stage a sit-in until their demands were met, including the release of political prisoners. Khan and many other PTI leaders and workers have been in jail for over a year on charges that they claim are politically motivated.Security forces launched a massive crackdown before midnight Tuesday after failing to stop protesters from marching to D-Chowk, a public square in Islamabad’s high-security red zone. In the evening authorities forced surrounding stores, cafes and markets to shut and then plunged the protest venue into darkness by switching off streetlights. Eyewitnesses said indiscriminate firing and teargas shelling, which started after 11pm and continued for about two hours, forced the PTI supporters, mostly Pashtuns from the northwest, to retreat.PTI claimed eight of its supporters had died in the late-night clashes and “hundreds” more were feared to have been killed. The govt stated three paramilitary troops and one policeman had died since the PTI launched its protest on Sunday. Islamabad’s police chief told media more than 900 people had been arrested in Tuesday’s raid, in which there were dozens of Afghan nationals.Sources at Islamabad’s two public hospitals said five civilians had died of gunshot wounds and dozens had been injured. According to PTI workers, they had picked up three bodies from the protest site.Information minister Attaullah Tarar said the protesters had fled in disarray, leaving behind vehicles, and even their shoes and clothes.PTI said in a post on social media that a “massacre has unfolded in Pakistan at the hands of security forces”. It accused the armed security forces of launching a violent assault on peaceful PTI protesters, firing live rounds with the intent to kill as many people as possible. It went on to compare last night’s clashes to the violence in the then East Pakistan in 1971. “The rulers have learned nothing from history and are prepared to destroy the country to cling to their illegitimate power,” the post stated. “With hundreds dead and countless injured, the interior minister’s threat to kill, and then the declaration of ‘victory’ over slaughtered innocents is enough evidence of the regime’s inhumanity,” it added.On Wednesday morning, the heavily fortified red zone was empty of protesters but dozens of smashed vehicles, including the charred remains of a truck from which Imran’s wife had been leading the protest, portrayed a grim picture.",At least eight supporters of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) were killed and dozens of others injured in Islamabad.

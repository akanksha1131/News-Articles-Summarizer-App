Wildfires rage across southern Europe | BBC News





Wildfires intensified across southern Europe on Wednesday, killing at least three people and forcing thousands to evacuate homes in Greece, Spain, Turkey and Albania.In Greece, firefighters worked through the night to protect the port city of Patras, the country’s third-largest city. Flames swept through pine forests and olive groves, burning houses, agricultural sites and dozens of vehicles. The fire service said the risk of more fires remained “very high” in several regions. At least 15 firefighters were injured or treated for burns, smoke inhalation and exhaustion.Residents joined the firefighting effort, using buckets of water and tree branches to beat down flames. Aircraft dropped water over the affected areas. Weeks of heatwaves have stretched firefighting resources across Greece and its neighbours. On the Greek island of Chios, exhausted firefighters were seen sleeping on the roadside after overnight shifts.In Albania, an 80-year-old man died in a fire south of Tirana. Villages in central Albania were evacuated, and explosions were reported in the Korca district due to buried World War II-era shells. Dozens of homes were destroyed.In Spain, a firefighting volunteer died in the Castile and Leon region, where thousands have been displaced. Some evacuees spent the night outdoors. Fires disrupted high-speed rail services between Madrid and Galicia.In Turkey, a forestry worker was killed and four others were injured when a fire truck crashed while responding to a blaze. Turkey has been battling wildfires since late June, with 18 deaths reported so far.France which is recovering from massive recent fires in the southern regions, faced another day of extreme heat, with temperatures reaching 42°C. Authorities restricted public events in high-risk areas.Officials across the region cited lightning storms, farming activities, faulty power lines and arson as possible causes.The European Union has sent ground teams and aircraft to help, including in Montenegro, where large fires continue to burn near the capital, Podgorica.","At least three people have died in wildfires in Greece, Spain, Turkey and Albania.

"'Crime in Washington highest': Trump says DC’s homicide rate worse than Mexico City, Islamabad; claims city safe under federal rule",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/crime-in-washington-highest-trump-says-dcs-homicide-rate-worse-than-mexico-city-islamabad-claims-city-safe-under-federal-rule/articleshow/123292594.cms,"Donald Trump (AP file photo)

.





US president Donald Trump on Wednesday said that Washington’s crime rate was among the highest in the world. He claimed DC’s homicide rate was worse than in cities like Mexico City, Bogota, Islamabad and Addis Ababa, and almost ten times higher than Fallujah in Iraq.Posting on Truth Social, the US president wrote, “If DC were a state, it would have the highest homicide rate of any state in America. The violent crime rate in DC has worsened, and the murder rate has essentially doubled in just over a decade. He also alleged manipulation of crime data. ""But these are only the ‘official’ statistics released by corrupt city officials. The real numbers are many times worse. In fact, a precinct commander was just suspended for allegedly manipulating the violent crime statistics, and the DC police union likewise says the real numbers are much higher,” Trump wrote.He further alleged that the Democrat government of DC had “largely stopped investigating, arresting and prosecuting most crime,” adding that no one was arrested for shoplifting.Trump said DC residents were living in fear and had largely given up on calling the police, instead avoiding the streets after dark.He added, “DC has been under siege from thugs and killers, but now DC is back under federal control where it belongs. The White House is in charge. The military and our great police will liberate this city, scrape away the filth, and make it safe, clean, habitable and beautiful once more!”Speaking at a press conference on Monday, Trump announced that the Metropolitan Police Department would now be under federal authority, with the National Guard deployed to restore order. He said the aim was to make the capital “safe, clean, habitable and beautiful” again.","US president Donald Trump on Wednesday said that Washington’s crime rate was among the highest in the world.

A school bus with over 40 children and one adult aboard overturned in Austin, Texas, on Wednesday, the first day of the new school year, injuring 12, as per officials, reported ABC News.The bus was transporting students from Leander Independent School District in northwest Austin, located in Travis County.Out of the 12 people taken to a local hospital from the scene, one person suffered life-threatening injuries and two others were critically injured, Austin-Travis County authorities reported at a Wednesday evening press conference.The rest, who suffered non-life-threatening injuries, were brought to a reunification center for evaluation and to be reunited with their families.The rollover happened after school but before any students were dropped off, as per Bruce Gearing, the superintendent of the Leander Independent School District, reported NBC News.The driver was an experienced veteran and noted that the bus mainly serves students from a local elementary school, Gearing said. He added that it remains unclear how many students were wearing seatbelts at the time of the rollover.“This part of our Leander ISD family has been through so much already this summer with the floods and this tragedy this afternoon is really breaking our hearts,” said Gearing, reported NBC News.“We want each of those students and their families to know that our prayers are with them, our thoughts are with them, and we will do everything that we can in our power to support them,” he added.It is still unclear why the 2024 model bus equipped with seatbelts veered off the right side of the road before overturning, as per an official from the Texas Department of Public Safety.The official pointed out a slight curve in the roadway and said a preliminary investigation is underway.","A school bus with over 40 children and one adult overturned in Austin, Texas, on Wednesday, the first day of the new school year.

‘Reprehensible act’: Indian temple in US vandalised; consulate seeks probe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/reprehensible-act-indian-temple-in-us-vandalised-consulate-seeks-probe/articleshow/123275155.cms,"



A Hindu temple in the United States has been vandalised, prompting condemnation from the Indian Consulate in Chicago. In a post on X, the consulate described the desecration of the main signboard of the BAPS Swaminarayan Temple in Greenwood, Indiana, as “reprehensible” and confirmed it had raised the matter with law enforcement for prompt action. The Consul General met devotees, local leaders and the Mayor of Greenwood, urging unity, solidarity and vigilance against “miscreants”.The incident comes less than 6 months after a similar act of vandalism at the BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir in Chino Hills, California. At the time, ministry of external affairs condemned the act “in the strongest terms” and urged local authorities to act swiftly and ensure security at places of worship. BAPS Public Affairs said the Hindu community would “stand steadfast against hate” and “never let hate take root”.The Coalition of Hindus of North America also linked such incidents to rising hostility towards Hindus, noting the timing ahead of a planned “Khalistan referendum” in Los Angeles. Previous attacks on BAPS temples were reported in Sacramento and New York last year, fuelling concerns over repeated targeting of Hindu places of worship across the US.","Vandalism at BAPS Swaminarayan Temple in Indiana described as'reprehensible' Indian Consul General met devotees, local leaders and the Mayor of Greenwood, urging unity, solidarity and vigilance against'miscreants' Incident comes less than 6 months after a similar act of vandalism at the BAPS Shri Swaminrayan Mandir in California.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123275239,imgsize-985007,width-400,resizemode-4/123275239.jpg"

'Treated like a criminal': New Zealand woman and 6-year-old son detained by ICE at US border; narrates 'terrifying' ordeal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/treated-like-a-criminal-new-zealand-woman-and-6-year-old-son-detained-by-ice-at-us-border-narrates-terrifying-ordeal/articleshow/123274510.cms,"Image: GoFundMe@/VictoriaBesancon





A New Zealand woman held at a US immigration center with her six-year-old son after being detained while crossing the Canada-US border is being “treated like a criminal,” said her friend and advocate, reported the Guardian.Sarah Shaw, 33, a New Zealander who has lived in Washington state for just over three years, dropped her two older children at Vancouver Airport on July 24 for them to take a direct flight to New Zealand to visit their grandparents.When she tried to re-enter US, the immigration and customs enforcement (ICE) detained her and her youngest son in what her friend Victoria Besancon described as a “terrifying” ordeal.“Sarah thought she was being kidnapped,” Besancon said, as quoted by the Guardian. “They didn’t really explain anything to her at first; they just kind of quietly took her and her son and immediately put them in like an unmarked white van.”Her phone was then confiscated, and she was transported to the Dilley immigration processing center in South Texas.Shaw is currently applying for a green card under a provision for domestic violence survivors. According to the GoFundMe page organised by Besancon, Shaw had work authorisation but had not yet received travel permission under what's known as a “combo card,” although her son had such permission.“It wasn’t until she tried to come back across the border that she realised only half of the combination card, because it’s only one physical card, had been fully approved,” Bescanson said.Meanwhile, all three of Shaw’s children have their I-360 visas approved, and Bescanson claimed that Sarah’s youngest son was therefore being held “illegally.”Minda Thorward, Shaw’s attorney, said that under the previous administrations, customs and border protection (CBP) would likely have quickly paroled her back into the country, but that approach has changed under Trump, reported NBC King 5 News.Shaw, who works for the Washington state department of children, youth, and families (DCYF), was preparing to start graduate school soon, as per the GoFundMe page.The fund, which raised over $33,000 by Monday morning, aims to cover legal fees and basic needs after Shaw depleted her savings on legal representation, reported Newsweek.“She gives therapy and counselling to some of our most at-risk youth … and to be treated like a criminal herself has just been absolutely devastating,” Bescanson said as quoted by the Guardian.Several legal US residents have been detained by ICE in the past months. While some detainees reportedly have criminal histories that might justify visa revocation, others argue that errors in paperwork led to their detention and believe they should be released.New Zealand’s foreign affairs ministry has confirmed that they are in contact with Shaw but provided no further details due to privacy concerns, reported The Guardian.","Sarah Shaw, 33, a New Zealander who has lived in Washington state for just over three years, dropped her two older children at Vancouver Airport on July 24 for them to take a direct flight to New Zealand.

A 37-year-old man hurled a Subway sandwich at a federal agent in the nation's capital.

Rubio's wish for Pakistan





United States secretary of state Marco Rubio on Thursday congratulated Pakistan on its Independence Day, ""appreciating Islamabad's engagement on counterterrorism and trade"".Rubio also reiterated US President Donald Trump's ambition to ""explore new areas of economic cooperation in critical minerals and hydrocarbons"" between the US and Pakistan.""On behalf of the United States, I extend our warm congratulations to the people of Pakistan as they celebrate their Independence Day on August 14,"" Rubio said in a statement.He further said: ""The United States deeply appreciates Pakistan’s engagement on counterterrorism and trade. We look forward to exploring new areas of economic cooperation, including critical minerals and hydrocarbons, and fostering dynamic business partnerships which will promote a prosperous future for Americans and Pakistanis.""Rubio’s remarks come amid what observers describe as a noticeable warming in Washington–Islamabad ties under Trump, a shift drawing close attention in New Delhi.Over the past year, the US and Pakistan have expanded their engagement beyond ""counterterrorism"" and trade to include cryptocurrency ventures, crude oil shipments, and cooperation on rare earth minerals.The renewed camaraderie between both nations follows heightened tensions between India and Pakistan after New Delhi’s retaliation for a Pakistan-backed terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pahalgam.Indian forces, acting against cross-border terrorism, destroyed multiple terror infrastructure in Pakistan, including the hotbeds like Bahalwalpur and Muridke.As the tension escalated, the Indian forces stepped up the retaliation -- bombing the Rahim Yar Khan Pakistani Air Force (PAF) base in Pakistan's southern Punjab region and Nur Khan air base in Rawalpindi, which prompted the US to intervene.Notably, the US has also used Nur Khan air base during the the Afghanitan war.Later, Trump, without credible evidence, repeatedly credited himself with easing potential conflict between the two nuclear-armed neighbours, while publicly praising Pakistan’s military leadership and advancing trade deals, including Islamabad’s first-ever imports of US crude oil.Experts suggest the renewed focus is “less about oil than access to minerals and rare earths,” which are crucial to the US economy and defence industries. The timing, alongside deeper military cooperation and high-level diplomatic praise, signals that strategic, economic, and geopolitical factors are all in play.","U.S. secretary of state Marco Rubio congratulated Pakistan on its Independence Day.

This redistricting dispute has prompted some Democratic-led states to threaten retaliation, with Governor Newsom suggesting the removal of five Republican-held seats in California.The redistricting conflict in Texas and possibly in other states carries national significance, as it could influence control of the US House of Representatives. The Texas GOP’s proposed map could give Republicans an additional three to five seats in next year’s midterm elections, potentially helping them maintain their narrow majority in the chamber.A spokesperson for California Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas confirmed that draft maps are expected to be released Friday, as reported by ABC News.Newsom said he will take part in the press conference this week with “powerful” Democrats, though he did not name them. On Monday, he sent a letter to Trump urging him to tell Texas Governor Greg Abbott and other Republican governors to stop trying to create new congressional maps.In Texas, Democrats have boycotted legislative sessions to block the GOP maps, preventing the state House from reaching a quorum. Texas House Speaker Dustin Burrows said the chamber will meet again Friday and warned that if there is still no quorum, Abbott will end the current session and immediately call a second special session.",California Governor Gavin Newsom on Tuesday in a X post announced that the state will move ahead with drawing new congressional maps. The changes could help Democrats regain control of the US House of Representatives and end President Donald Trump's time in office. The announcement comes as Texas Republicans work to redraw congressional maps to benefit their party.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123289683,imgsize-1083897,width-400,resizemode-4/123289683.jpg"

BIG! Putin To Meet Zelensky? Trump Vows 3-Way Meeting Without Asking After Warning On ‘Russia Bluff’





A divided US federal appeals court ruled on Wednesday that the Trump administration can proceed with billions of dollars in cuts to foreign assistance programs.In a 2-1 decision, the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit overturned a lower court ruling that would have required the restoration of aid funds approved by Congress.After returning to office in January, President Trump froze billions in foreign aid spending and began winding down the US Agency for International Development (USAID), the main federal agency responsible for distributing humanitarian assistance with health and emergency programs in about 120 countries.Earlier this year, District Judge Amir Ali, appointed by former President Joe Biden , issued a temporary restraining order prohibiting the Trump administration from suspending the foreign aid funds approved by Congress for fiscal year 2024.The appeals court reversed that decision, ruling that the grant recipients who sued did not have the legal right to bring the case. ""The district court erred in granting that relief because the grantees lack a cause of action to press their claims,” wrote Judge Karen Henderson, appointed by former President George HW Bush.Henderson and Judge Gregory Katsas joined the majority opinion, while Judge Florence Pan, a Biden appointee, dissented.Trump after assuming presidency for the second term has embarked on a broad effort to shrink or dismantle large parts of the federal government during his second term.","The US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit overturned a lower court ruling that would have required the restoration of aid funds approved by Congress.

What is the Shope papillomavirus in rabbits?

How the virus spreads among rabbits



Impact of the virus on rabbit health

Can it infect dogs, cats, or humans?







Where are infected rabbits most commonly found?

What to do if you see an infected rabbit





A bizarre, naturally occurring virus is giving wild rabbits a truly unsettling makeover — transforming their faces with horn-like or tentacle-shaped growths that have earned them the nickname “zombie bunnies. ” Known as Shope papillomavirus (SPV) or cottontail rabbit papillomavirus (CRPV), this infection primarily affects wild cottontail rabbits in the United States. While the strange protrusions are usually harmless to humans and other animals, they can cause severe problems for rabbits, from impaired vision to difficulty eating, sometimes making them easy targets for predators. The virus has fascinated scientists for decades, and sightings continue in parts of the Midwest every year.Shope papillomavirus is a DNA virus that specifically targets rabbits, especially wild cottontail species. First identified in the 1930s by Dr. Richard Shope, it has been the subject of scientific study for nearly a century. The virus causes wart-like tumors, called papillomas, to form on the head, face, and ears. These growths can resemble horns, spikes, or fleshy tentacles, creating the eerie “zombie bunny” look.While most growths are benign, they can sometimes become cancerous. Domestic rabbits, while less likely to contract SPV, can still be infected if exposed to wild carriers or infected biting insects.SPV is spread mainly through direct rabbit-to-rabbit contact or by blood-feeding insects such as mosquitoes, fleas, and ticks. These insects tend to target the head and ear areas where fur is thinner, making it easier for the virus to enter through small wounds. Once inside, the virus causes rapid skin cell growth, leading to the formation of tumours. The risk of spread is highest in warmer months when insect populations surge. In areas where rabbits congregate in high numbers, such as breeding grounds or food-rich fields, transmission can be swift and affect a significant portion of the population.Although the Shope papillomavirus rarely kills rabbits directly, its effects can be life-threatening in indirect ways. Large growths around the eyes can obstruct vision, making it harder to spot predators. Tumors near the mouth or nose can interfere with eating or breathing, potentially leading to starvation or respiratory distress. Infected rabbits often become slower and weaker, increasing their vulnerability to predators. While some rabbits develop an immune response that causes the growths to shrink or disappear over time, others may suffer from persistent or worsening tumors.The Shope papillomavirus is strictly species-specific — it only infects rabbits. This means there is no danger to humans, dogs, cats, or other common pets. However, domestic rabbits can be at risk if they are bitten by infected insects or come into direct contact with infected wild rabbits. Pet owners are advised to keep rabbits indoors during peak insect activity and to use protective enclosures outdoors. While SPV cannot “jump” to other animals, it can still have serious implications for pet rabbits if precautions are not taken.The virus is most often seen in wild rabbit populations in parts of the United States, especially in the Midwest, including South Dakota and Colorado. These regions frequently report sightings of rabbits with horn-like growths during late spring and summer. Because some infected rabbits show no visible symptoms, tracking the true spread of the virus can be difficult. Wildlife experts note that SPV has likely existed for centuries in North America, only becoming widely known after photographs of “horned rabbits” began circulating in popular media.If you encounter a wild rabbit with horn-like growths, it is best to observe from a distance. Handling or attempting to treat the animal can cause unnecessary stress and increase the risk of spreading the virus to other rabbits. Wildlife authorities recommend leaving infected wild rabbits undisturbed, as many can survive with the condition or recover naturally. For pet rabbits showing suspicious growths, a veterinarian should be consulted promptly. In severe cases, surgical removal of tumors may be necessary. Preventive care includes insect control, regular health checks, and keeping domestic rabbits separated from wild populations.","Shope papillomavirus is a DNA virus that specifically targets rabbits, especially wild cottontail species.

Kennedy Center Honors recipients 2025: From George Strait to Michael Crawford,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kennedy-center-honors-recipients-2025-from-george-strait-to-michael-crawford-who-will-be-awarded-by-trump/articleshow/123286261.cms,"George Strait (left) and Michael Crawford (right) (AP images)





US President Donald Trump on Wednesday has named the first batch of Kennedy Center Honors recipients under his leadership as the center’s chairman. The list includes country music star George Strait, “Rocky” actor Sylvester Stallone, singer Gloria Gaynor , rock band Kiss and actor-singer Michael Crawford . Trump said he will personally host the awards program.He also announced plans to fully renovate the John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, calling it a future “crown jewel” of American arts and culture.“We're going to bring it to a higher level than it ever hit,” Trump said. The upgraded venue will feature in next year’s celebrations marking America’s 250th anniversary. Trump added that he didn’t want to host the program but was invited to do so and agreed.Trump, who avoided the event during his first term after some artists boycotted in protest, has since taken control of the institution. Earlier this year, he replaced the Kennedy Center’s board of trustees with his own appointees.In a Truth Social post on Tuesday, Trump jokingly referred to change the name for the center to “Trump/Kennedy Center” and promised to restore it to “top-level” luxury and glamour.The post read, "" Great Nominees for the Trump/Kennedy Center, whoops, I mean, Kennedy Centre awards.They will be announced Wednesday. Tremendous work is being done, and money being spent, on bringing it back to the absolute top level of luxury, glamour, and entertainment.""""It had fallen on hard times, physically, but will soon be making a major comeback!!! President DJT.""In a statement on social media, the Kennedy Center said it was “honored” to host Trump, who was visiting for the third time since January. “Thanks to his advocacy, our beautiful building will undergo renovations to restore its prestige and grandeur,” the venue said.During a visit to the building in March, Trump had criticized the venue’s condition, calling it in “tremendous disrepair.”Trump said he was “about 98% involved” in selecting this year’s honorees, rejecting some candidates he considered “too woke” or too liberal. He described the artists, including several of his favorites, as “great people.”Traditionally, a bipartisan advisory committee has made the selections, but it is unclear how the process was handled this year.The Kennedy Center Honors, established in 1978, have recognized a wide range of artists, often with presidents from both parties in attendance. Past honorees have included both political allies and opponents of sitting presidents.During his first term in 2017, Trump and First Lady Melania Trump skipped the event after several recipients, including Norman Lear, said they would not attend in protest of Trump’s proposed arts funding cuts. Since returning to office, Trump has taken a more direct role in the center’s governance, including influencing programming decisions and pledging to end performances featuring drag artists.These moves have drawn criticism from parts of the arts community. In March, the producers of Hamilton withdrew plans to stage the musical at the center in 2026, citing Trump’s leadership changes.In July, House Republicans added an amendment to a spending bill, later signed by Trump, to rename the Kennedy Center’s Opera House in honor of Melania Trump. The change has not yet been implemented. Maria Shriver , a Democrat and niece of the late President Kennedy, called this move as “insane.”","US President Donald Trump has named the first batch of Kennedy Center Honors recipients under his leadership as the center’s chairman.

NEW DELHI: Actor-turned-BJP leader Mithun Chakraborty on Tuesday hit back at Pakistan People’s Party chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari over his remarks on the Indus Waters Treaty , warning that India could respond with “a series of BrahMos missiles” in case of any provocation.Speaking to reporters, Chakraborty accused the Pakistani establishment of warmongering while emphasising that his comments were not directed at the people of Pakistan, whom he described as peace-loving. “If such words and rhetoric continue to be made, and we lose our cool, we will dispatch one BrahMos after another to strike them,” he said.Chakraborty also made an unusual remark, claiming that India would build a dam where “140 crore Indians will relieve themselves” before releasing the water to unleash a “tsunami” on Pakistan, adding that the comment was aimed solely at Bhutto-Zardari.“We will build a dam where 140 crore of our people will relieve themselves. And once the dam is opened, it will lead to a tsunami without a single shot being fired. I apologise for saying this. These words are only meant for him (Bhutto), not for the people of Pakistan,” he said.His statement came in response to Bhutto’s speech at the shrine of Sindhi saint Shah Abdul Latif Bhitai on Monday, where the Pakistani leader warned New Delhi against any attempt to disrupt the Indus River’s flow. ““If war is waged, then… we will send a message to the Modi government that we do not retreat, we do not bow down, and if you dare think about launching an attack on the Indus River, then the people of every province of Pakistan will be ready to confront you. ”Tensions over the treaty have risen since April 22, when India placed the 1960 agreement “in abeyance” following the Pahalgam terror attack.",Actor-turned-BJP leader Mithun Chakraborty hit back at Pakistan People’s Party chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari over his remarks on the Indus Waters Treaty.

‘Seed Of Pakistan Will Be Destroyed’: Foreign Affairs Expert Warns Islamabad After Nuke Threat





PESHAWAR/ISLAMABAD: Four people were injured when an improvised explosive device derailed six coaches of the Peshawar-bound Jafar Express in the Mastung district of Pakistan's restive Balochistan province on Sunday.There were, however, no casualties, officials said.This is the latest in a series of attacks targeting the Jafar Express.The improvised explosive device (IED) explosion hit the track near Spezand Railway Station, about 25 km from Quetta, shortly after the train with 350 passengers had departed the city at 9 am (local time), a railways official said.""A bomb attached to the railway track exploded loudly, derailing six bogies of the train heading from Quetta to Peshawar. Fortunately, there was no loss of life,"" Muhammad Kashif, public relations officer of the Pakistan Railways' Quetta division, told the media.All injured passengers sustained minor wounds, the official said.Rescue teams, including railway staff, were dispatched to the site, and a relief train was sent to transport stranded passengers to Quetta.Security forces and police cordoned off the area, while a bomb disposal squad was deployed to clear the track.Meanwhile, in a separate statement, Kashif said the services of the Jaffar Express and Bolan Mail were suspended till August 14.The Bolan Mail will resume its operations on August 16 (Saturday), when it will depart from Karachi ""in its proper turn"" and will arrive in Quetta the next day, he added.The Jafar Express, which runs between Quetta and Peshawar, has been repeatedly targeted in recent months.On August 7, the train narrowly escaped a disaster near Balochistan's Sibi railway station, where a bomb planted near the track exploded just after the passenger train had passed.In another incident, on August 4, gunmen fired five bullets at its pilot engine near Kolpur. The separatist Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for the latter attack.In June, a remotely controlled explosive device fitted to rail tracks exploded, causing four bogies of the Jaffar Express to derail in Jacobabad.On March 11, the Jaffar Express was hijacked while traveling from Quetta to Peshawar in the Bolan area, resulting in the deaths of 21 passengers and four security personnel. The security forces in a targeted operation killed 33 terrorists involved in attacking the train.It is believed that ethnic Baloch terrorist groups carry out such attacks.A July 28 derailment of the same train in Sindh province's Sukkur was initially attributed to an explosion but the Ministry of Railways later said it was due to a technical fault.","A bomb attached to the railway track exploded loudly, derailing six bogies of the train heading from Quetta to Peshawar.

Pakistan: Tablighi Jamaat's grip on Khyber Pakhtunkhwa fuels concerns of radicalisation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-tablighi-jamaats-grip-on-khyber-pakhtunkhwa-fuels-concerns-of-radicalisation/articleshow/123203430.cms,"Pakistan: Tablighi Jamaat's grip on Khyber Pakhtunkhwa fuels concerns of radicalisation





KHYBER PAKHTUNKHWA: The rise of the Tablighi Jamaat in Pakistan's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province is sparking fears of cultural erosion and the steady grooming of recruits for radical movements. As reported by Himal Southasian, many Pashtuns say the orthodox Deobandi missionary group is dismantling traditional practices while quietly laying the ideological groundwork for extremism.In Bajaur district, a young resident told Himal Southasian that ""men and women used to dress fashionably, enjoy music, watch television, visit shrines, and play sports without being judged."" Today, he said, the Tablighi Jamaat's puritanical preaching has transformed local life. Activities once central to Pashtun culture are now branded as sinful. ""It has changed the cultural landscape drastically,"" he warned, noting that while the group does not directly preach violence, it produces ""raw human resources that can be easily turned into jihadists. ""Founded in colonial India in 1926, the Tablighi Jamaat is now a global organisation with millions of followers. In Pakistan, its headquarters in Raiwind, Punjab, commands vast influence.According to Himal Southasian, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has become one of the movement's most fertile grounds, with the group leveraging its ""quietist"" image to avoid official scrutiny while embedding Deobandi orthodoxy deep into Pashtun society.The group's impact is most visible in cultural change. Himal Southasian documents how shrines, folk music, mixed-gender dances, and colourful traditional clothing are being replaced by conservative dress codes and rigid segregation. A North Waziristan academic described the Jamaat as ""the root of evil... laying the ideological groundwork for the future Taliban"" and importing an ""Arab culture"" that dismisses Pashtun identity.While the Tablighi Jamaat insists it is apolitical and non-violent, Himal Southasian reports that it shares the sectarian orientation of groups such as the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. Its close alignment with the Pakistan state's Islamisation project dates back to the 1980s, when military ruler Zia ul-Haq and the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) used Deobandi networks - including Tablighi circles - to recruit Pashtun fighters for the Afghan jihad against the Soviet Union. Former ISI chief Javed Nasir was himself a Tablighi Jamaat member.Critics in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa told Himal Southasian that the group's influence has depoliticised Pashtun communities, discouraging discussion of exploitation or military abuses. This ideological shift, they argue, suits the Pakistani establishment, which has long used Islam as a tool for domestic control and foreign policy. A Peshawar lecturer warned that ""Tablighis are making our people orthodox, helping Islamist sectarian groups"" and turning them away from Pashtun nationalism and resistance to militancy.The group's gatherings draw hundreds of thousands annually to Raiwind and regional centres. A businessperson from Khyber district told Himal Southasian that almost every household in the tribal areas now has a member. The Jamaat's appeal as a ""peaceful"" alternative to militant brutality has made it a mass movement - but one that critics say nurtures a mindset receptive to Taliban influence.Perhaps most troubling, Himal Southasian notes, is the way the Tablighi Jamaat erodes ethnic identity in favour of pan-Islamic loyalty. This mirrors the Taliban's removal of Afghanistan's national flag in favour of the white shahada banner. ""Extremism and war have taken away every good thing from us,"" a South Waziristan student lamented.For Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's embattled Pashtuns, the rise of the Tablighi Jamaat represents more than religious revival - it signals Pakistan's ongoing project to reshape a proud, distinct culture into a pliant tool for its Islamist and geopolitical ambitions. As Himal Southasian's reporting makes clear, the consequences are already visible, and they reach far beyond the mosque walls.","Tablighi Jamaat's influence in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province fuels concerns of radicalisation.

The body of a man missing for 28 years has been discovered in a melting glacier in Pakistan’s remote Kohistan region.

""The body was intact. The clothes were not even torn.""An ID card was found with the body bearing the name Naseeruddin, allowing police to identify him as a man who went missing in June 1997 after falling into a glacier crevasse in the area.Once police confirmed the body was that of Naseeruddin, locals came forward with additional information, Khan said.Naseeruddin, who was married with two children, was travelling on horseback with his brother on the day he disappeared. The two had reportedly left home due to a family dispute, as per the police, reports the BBC.His brother, who was with Naseeruddin during the 1997 incident, said they had chosen an unconventional mountain route to avoid possible threats, reports the Express Tribune.He recalled hearing gunfire on their return journey, and in an attempt to escape the attackers, Naseeruddin took refuge in an icy cave, never to be seen again.An extensive search was carried out at that time, but Naseeruddin could not be traced, and a symbolic funeral was held at the location.With the body finally recovered after 28 years, his brother is returning to Lady Valley to determine whether to lay the remains to rest there or bring them back to the family’s ancestral home.Reduced snowfall in the region has left glaciers more exposed to direct sunlight, accelerating the ice-melting process, highlighting how higher temperatures are speeding up glacial melt, reports the BBC.","The body of a man missing for 28 years has been discovered in a melting glacier in Pakistan’s remote Kohistan region.

India Slams Pakistan Army Chief Asim Munir’s ‘Half The World’ Nuclear Threat With Sharp Rebuttal





The Pakistan Army on Wednesday firmly dismissed as ""baseless"" speculation that its Chief of Army Staff General Asim Munir is seeking to become the country’s next president, amid persistent rumours circulating on social media.""Talks about Field Marshal Asim Munir becoming the president are completely baseless,"" said Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry in an interview with The Economist, a clip of which was shared by the state-run PTV on social media.Chaudhry asserted that ""the army chief has no interest in the presidency and no such proposal is under consideration.""The clarification comes after weeks of unverified reports suggesting Munir might replace the incumbent President, Asif Ali Zardari . Both Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and interior minister Mohsin Naqvi had previously dismissed the rumours as a “malicious campaign” aimed at spreading ""political instability.""In May, Munir was elevated to the rarely conferred rank of Field Marshal following a brief four-day conflict with India. The move, which made him only the second five-star officer in Pakistan’s history after Ayub Khan, was widely viewed as a signal of the army chief further consolidating his authority.In a country where the army chief's position is the most powerful, and no civilian prime minister has completed a full term, the elevation was seen by many as a clear assertion of the military's primacy over the political leadership.","Pakistan Army dismisses speculation that its Chief of Army Staff General Asim Munir is seeking to become the country’s next president.

A United Nations-backed investigator has revealed disturbing evidence of “systemic torture” inside Myanmar’s detention centres, describing electric shocks, strangulations, gang rape and the burning of sexual body parts among the abuses that were documented over the past year.Nicholas Koumjian, head of the international independent team investigating atrocities in the country, spoke as the group released its latest annual report on Tuesday, covering the 12 months to 30 June.The country has been in turmoil since February 2021, ever since the army overthrew Aung San Suu Kyi’s elected government, sparking a civil war. As peaceful protests were crushed with lethal force, those opposing military rule took up arms.Since then, conflict has engulfed large parts of Myanmar.The investigative team, as quoted by AP, said that it had made progress in identifying security personnel involved in detention operations, as well as “perpetrators who have summarily executed captured combatants or civilians accused of being informers.”These perpetrators included members of the security forces, affiliated militias and opposition armed groups.The report details the ""documented torture in Myanmar’s detention facilities which includes beatings, electric shocks, strangulations, gang rape, burning of sexual body parts and other forms of sexual violence,"" according to a summary of the findings.“Our report highlights a continued increase in the frequency and brutality of atrocities committed in Myanmar,” Koumjian said. “We are working towards the day when the perpetrators will have to answer for their actions in a court of law.”“We have uncovered significant evidence, including eyewitness testimony, showing systematic torture in Myanmar detention facilities,” he further added.The team also launched new investigations into atrocities committed in Rakhine state, where the military and the Arakan Army, an opposition force, are battling for control.Rakhine has long been the scene of grave abuses. More than 700,000 people from the Rohingya minority fled to neighbouring Bangladesh in 2017 to escape persecution. About 70,000 more crossed the border last year after the Arakan Army effectively seized control of the territory.The Independent Investigative Mechanism on Myanmar has been operating since 2018 under a mandate from the UN-backed Human Rights Council to document human rights abuses and violations in the country.It has already shared evidence with authorities pursuing cases involving the Rohingya at the International Criminal Court and the UN’s International Court of Justice.","U.N.-backed team releases annual report covering the 12 months to 30 June.

Three Thai soldiers were injured in a landmine explosion on Saturday while patrolling near the Cambodian border, just days after the two countries agreed to extend a fragile ceasefire following their deadliest clashes in decades.The blast took place in Sisaket province at around 10 AM local time (0300 GMT), the Royal Thai Military said in a statement. One soldier sustained a severe leg injury, another suffered wounds to his back and arm, while the third experienced serious ear damage from the blast’s pressure.Tensions have been high since last month’s five-day conflict over disputed ancient temples along the 800-kilometre (500-mile) border, which left at least 43 people dead and forced more than 300,000 residents from their homes. The fighting, which involved jets, artillery, rockets and infantry, ended on 29 July after mediation by US President Donald Trump.On Thursday, Thai and Cambodian defence officials met in Kuala Lumpur and agreed to extend the truce. However, Saturday’s incident has cast doubt over the ceasefire’s stability.Thailand’s foreign ministry accused Cambodia of laying new landmines in violation of the agreement and said it would file an official protest.

Sri Lanka: Ex-minister from Rajapaksa family arrested for alleged corruption; first from once-powerful dynasty,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/sri-lanka-ex-minister-from-rajapaksa-family-arrested-for-alleged-corruption-first-from-once-powerful-dynasty/articleshow/123143702.cms,"Shasheendra Rajapaksa





Sri Lankan authorities on Wednesday arrested former minister Shasheendra Rajapaksa, a nephew of ex-presidents Gotabaya and Mahinda Rajapaksa, over corruption charges related to misusing state land and claiming undue compensation.The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) said Shasheendra coerced officials into granting him compensation for property damage, even though the asset in question was located on state-owned land. He is also accused of misusing government land, fraudulently claiming losses, and committing corruption during the aftermath of the 2022 mass protests which forced Gotabaya to resign.This marks the first arrest of a Rajapaksa family member since the leftist government of President Anura Kumara Dissanayake took office in September 2024, pledging a crackdown on entrenched corruption.Shasheendra, son of former parliamentary speaker Chamal, the eldest Rajapaksa brother, was produced before a Colombo magistrate and remanded till August 19.The once-dominant Rajapaksa family faces mounting legal troubles. Shasheendra’s cousins Namal and Yoshitha (Mahinda’s sons) are battling money laundering charges. Basil Rajapaksa, another brother of Chamal, Mahinda and Gotabaya, and an ex-minister, is under investigation for financial misconduct.Sri Lanka is still recovering from its worst economic crisis in decades, which saw it default on $46 billion in external debt in 2022, triggering nationwide protests and a political upheaval.","Shasheendra Rajapaksa is a nephew of ex-presidents Gotabaya and Mahinda.

Afghanistan earthquake: Two tremors strike region within hours; no damage reported so far,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/afghanistan-earthquake-two-tremors-strike-region-within-hours-no-damage-reported-so-far/articleshow/123139919.cms,"Representative Image (ANI image)





An earthquake of 4.4 magnitude struck Afghanistan on Wednesday, according to the National Center for Seismology (NCS). The quake occurred at 2:24 pm IST, at a depth of 155 kilometers. The epicenter was located at latitude 36.51°N and longitude 70.70°E within the Afghan territory.This was the second quake recorded today, as seismic activity continues to affect the region. Earlier, a magnitude 4.2 earthquake struck at 12:19 pm IST. It occurred at a depth of 47 kilometers, with the epicenter located at latitude 36.54°N and longitude 71.52°E.This is the latest in a series of earthquakes to hit the region in recent days. On August 2, a stronger earthquake measuring 5.5 on the Richter scale struck Afghanistan at a depth of 87 kilometers. Prior to that, on July 29, a 4.8-magnitude earthquake was recorded at a shallow depth of just 10 kilometers.Shallow earthquakes are more dangerous than deep earthquakes. This is so because the seismic waves from shallow earthquakes have a shorter distance to travel to the surface, resulting in stronger ground shaking causing more damage to structures and greater casualties.According to the Red Cross, Afghanistan lies on several fault lines between the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates, particularly in the Hindu Kush mountain region, making it one of the most earthquake-prone areas in the world.The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA), Afghanistan warn that frequent quakes continue to pose a serious threat to communities in the country, which are already vulnerable due to decades of conflict and underdevelopment.The organization also noted that the country is highly vulnerable to natural disasters, including seasonal flooding, landslides and earthquakes.","An earthquake of 4.4 magnitude struck Afghanistan on Wednesday.

Bangladesh Interim Chief Yunus To Stay After Resignation Threat Amid Protests Over Rohingya Corridor

July Declaration unveiled:

Tight security and public celebration:





Bangladesh’s interim chief adviser and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus on Tuesday announced that the country’s next general elections will be held in February 2026, ahead of the holy month of Ramadan. He made the declaration during his address to the nation via state television, BTV and radio to mark the first anniversary of the mass uprising that ousted former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina ""On behalf of the interim government, I will write to the Chief Election Commissioner, requesting that the Election Commission organise a national election in February 2026, before the next Ramadan,"" Yunus said.The announcement marks a shift from his earlier indication that polls would be held in April. The revised timeline comes after consultations with major political parties, including the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) headed by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia which had called for earlier elections.""We will all begin mental preparation and institutional arrangements from tomorrow to complete all arrangements so that this year's election is memorable in the country's history in terms of joy and celebration, peace and order, voter turnout, and cordiality,"" he added.Yunus urged political parties to ensure that youth and women are not excluded from their manifestos or future governance plans. ""Remember, the youth who have changed Bangladesh have the power to change the world as well,"" he said.Earlier today, the interim government had also formally released the ""July Declaration"", a 26-point document outlining proposed reforms in governance, constitutional and political issues.Top leaders from political groups such as the BNP, Jamaat-e-Islami, and the newly formed National Citizen Party (NCP) were present during the official unveiling at the Bangladesh Parliament Complex, commemorating the uprising anniversary.The declaration sharply criticized the 1972 Constitution after its independence war against Pakistan in 1971, calling for reforms aligned with the will of the people.""Whereas, the post-independence Awami League government failed to materialise the people's aspirations because of the weaknesses in the procedures of drafting and in the structure of the constitution, along with its inappropriate application,"" the July Declaration said.It also condemned Sheikh Hasina’s administration, accusing it of turning Bangladesh into a fascist, mafia and failed state through alleged authoritarian rule and human rights violations.""Whereas, during the rule of Sheikh Hasina, under her very leadership, an extreme force that was anti-people, autocratic and against human rights turned Bangladesh into a fascist, mafia and failed state and thereby tarnished Bangladesh's international image,"" it added.The document calls for the 2024 uprising to be given official recognition and proposes that the July Declaration be included in a reformed constitution.Tens of thousands gathered at Manik Mia Avenue in Dhaka to mark the anniversary of Hasina’s ouster. The government declared the day a national holiday. Security was heightened across the capital, with police checkpoints and patrols in sensitive areas.Sheikh Hasina, who had been in power for 15 years, fled to India in August last year following mass protests. Her party, the Awami League, has since been banned by the interim administration, and its registration has been revoked by the Election Commission, effectively barring it from contesting in future polls unless the ban is lifted.Meanwhile, Human Rights Watch (HRW) raised concerns over the interim government's progress on human rights.""The hope of the thousands who braved lethal violence a year ago when they opposed Sheikh Hasina's abusive rule to build a rights-respecting democracy remains unfulfilled,"" said Meenakshi Ganguly, deputy Asia director at HRW.She warned that the interim leadership is struggling to balance security reform with pressures from hardliners and rival political factions.As the nation reflects on the events of the past year, Bangladesh remains on high alert. The month of August also marks the anniversary of the 1975 assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the country’s founding figure and Hasina’s father.","Bangladesh's interim chief adviser and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus announced that the country’s next general elections will be held in February 2026.

A newly formed political party led by students who played a key role in the anti-government protests that led to the ouster of former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina held a rally in the country's capital Dhaka on Sunday, pledging to build a new Bangladesh amid ongoing political uncertainty surrounding the next national election, reported news agency AP.The National Citizen Party, formed by the organisers of last year’s protests, gathered near the Shaheed Minar monument with around 1,000 supporters. Party leader Nahid Islam announced a 24-point agenda and called for the creation of a new constitution to replace the one adopted in 1972.“Exactly one year ago, at this Shaheed Minar (memorial), we vowed to free this country from the hands of dictatorship. By responding to that call, we together defeated the fascist rule and regained control of our country,” Islam said.“Let us all unite and transform this historic 24-point agenda into reality to build a new Bangladesh, a Bangladesh that fulfills the dreams of all citizens, as we move toward the formation of our second republic,” he added, as quoted by the agency.The party did not provide specific details on the proposed constitution but said its goal was to reflect the aspirations of a new generation of Bangladeshis.Separately, the student wing of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) also held a large rally in Dhaka.BNP acting chairman Tarique Rahman, who has been in exile in London since 2008, addressed the crowd virtually and urged supporters to mobilise young voters ahead of the upcoming polls, according to AP.Rahman said, “We must reclaim our democratic rights and engage the youth in shaping Bangladesh’s future.”The rallies took place two days before the interim government, led by Nobel peace prize laureate Muhammad Yunus is set to mark the first anniversary of Sheikh Hasina’s departure from power.Hasina fled to India on August 5, 2024, following weeks of mass protests and political unrest that resulted in hundreds of deaths and thousands of injuries. Yunus assumed office on August 8.The demonstrations come amid criticism of the interim government’s handling of law and order, with opposition parties accusing it of failing to contain mob violence and uphold human rights.With Hasina’s Awami League banned and the political future still unclear, the rallies highlighted the growing activity among both new and established political forces ahead of the next election.","National Citizen Party, formed by the organisers of last year’s protests, gathered near the Shaheed Minar monument with around 1,000 supporters.

"China push: In Nepal, EVs now account for 76% of all vehicles sold",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/china-push-in-nepal-evs-now-account-for-76-of-all-vehicles-sold/articleshow/122960428.cms,"



KATHMANDU: The narrow streets of Kathmandu - sized for pedestrians and rickshaws - are choked with engines. Buses, motorbikes, small trucks and taxis fill the sprawling valley with horns and exhaust. For its more than 3 million residents, just getting around is a dangerous, eye-stinging ordeal.But recently, a new kind of motor has started to ease the crush. Sleek electric vehicles glide by with a quiet hum. Gleaming showrooms do a brisk business in the latest models, and charging stations on highways have turned into rest stops with cafes for drivers. Over the past year, EVs accounted for 76% of all passenger vehicles and half of the light commercial vehicles sold in Nepal. Five years ago, that number was essentially zero. The EV market share in Nepal is now behind only those of a few countries, including Norway, Singapore and Ethiopia. The average for all countries was 20% in 2024.The swift turnover is the result of govt policies aimed at leveraging Nepal's wealth of hydropower, easing dependence on imported fossil fuels and clearing the smog. It has been fed by an intense push from Nepal's biggest neighbour, China, world's dominant manufacturer of battery-powered vehicles.""For us, using EVs is a comparative advantage,"" said Mahesh Bhattarai, DG of Nepal's department of customs. ""In the global market, Chinese EVs are expanding. The same is happening in Nepal."" The effort stands in contrast to policies in the US and Europe, which have blocked Chinese EVs to protect their domestic auto industries. And it carries hope for other developing countries that seek to become wealthier without enduring the crucible of pollution from which many rich nations have already emerged.""We're interested in making sure this rapid growth in these emerging markets doesn't follow the same trajectory as developed markets,"" said the head of sustainable transportation for UN Environment Programme. But as Nepal has learned, there are obstacles. The country has spent heavily on subsidies, and getting rid of the support too quickly could derail the shift to battery power. Even if gas-powered passenger cars are phased out, cleaning the air will require public transportation to go electric as well.Asian Development Bank has been a key financier of Nepal's dams, transmission lines and charging networks. The head of ADB's resident mission in Nepa is cautious about the risk of backsliding. ""Given the economic sense this EV conversion represents, I think I would see it as unlikely that we would have major policy change.""Businesses and advocates are, however, concerned Nepal may already be backing off its commitment to the transition. It has had three PMs in past five years, and priorities have shifted with each of them. Nepal's central bank doubled down-payment requirements for EVs. Govt has been inching up its tariffs on EVs. And auto dealers worry faulty cars from some smaller Chinese brands could discredit the category. Rajan Babu Shrestha holds the licence to distribute cars in Nepal from Tata Motors. He has seen sales skyrocket on his EVs, but he could go back to selling gas-powered vehicles if tariffs rose or subsidies for charging stations went away. ""Stability is always a question mark.""","Electric vehicles account for 76% of all passenger vehicles and half of light commercial vehicles sold in Nepal.

UK court of appeal refuses to increase sentence of boy who killed Bhim Kohli,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-court-of-appeal-refuses-to-increase-sentence-of-boy-who-killed-bhim-kohli/articleshow/123288743.cms,"



LONDON: Court of Appeal judges here have refused to increase the seven-year sentence given to a 15-year-old boy for killing much-loved 80-year-old British Indian grandfather Bhim Kohli, saying the sentence he was handed down was correct.On Wednesday, Lady Justice Macur, Justice Cutts and Justice Murray dismissed the application by the solicitor-general for permission to appeal against the boy’s sentence on the basis it was unduly lenient.The judges also dismissed an application for permission to appeal the sentence by the boy’s lawyer, Balraj Bhatia KC, who claimed it was “manifestly excessive”.Lucy Rigby KC had referred the case to the Court of Appeal in July. The boy was acquitted of murder but convicted of manslaughter in April and sentenced in June.Kohli, an active and fit man who was held in high regard by the local community, was killed on Sept 1, 2024 while walking his dog in a Leicestershire park. The boy, then aged 14, put on a balaclava, knocked him to the ground, then hit him round the head with his slider shoe as he was on his knees trying to get up as a girl he was with, then aged 12, laughed and filmed the attack on her mobile.The boy attacked Kohli a second time near the park exit, punching and kicking him, breaking three ribs. He died later in hospital.The sentencing was enhanced due to aggravating factors which included the boy calling Kohli a “Paki”. Kohli was born in Punjab, India.Bhatia argued that calling Kohli a “Paki” was at the lower end of the scale of racism and the addition to the sentence was excessive. The court heard the boy’s sentence was half what an adult would get.Lady Justice Macur said: “We understand that not only his family but the public too were shocked at the lenient sentence of 7 years. However , the sentencing of children and young people for serious offences is complex. Many are not fully developed and may not understand the pain they cause to victims. The court must bear in mind the principle is to prevent offending and the welfare of the child. We do not find the sentence unduly lenient. ”She rejected the argument that adding six months to the sentence for racial aggravating factors was excessive and praised Kohli’s “sunny disposition” and “enjoyment of life” to his family who were in court.","Court of Appeal judges refuse to increase the seven-year sentence given to a 15-year-old boy for killing much-loved British Indian grandfather Bhim Kohli.

Four men in Northampton, England, raced away from an Indian restaurant without paying their 200-pound (about Rs 21,000) bill, which led to a spectacular chase by the staff. According to a Daily Mail article, the event took place in the Saffron restaurant at around 10.11 pm on August 4.Men can be seen entering the restaurant in the widely circulated CCTV footage posted on Instagram. Later in the video, they can be seen rushing out of the restaurant's door after leaving their table. When they reveal their intent, a staff member may be seen pursuing them. According to the complaint by the eatery, those men ordered and consumed 197.30 pounds of food, which included lamb chops, several curries, and other dishes.The company later posted the bill on Facebook. The bill breakdown included four plain poppadoms for £5.60, one chutney tray for £2.20, two chargrilled lamb chops for £24.00, three chicken chat dishes for £30.00, two chicken tikka mains for £28.00, two chicken tikka masalas for £32.00, two boiled rice portions for £11.00, two garlic naans for £12.00, three chapatis for £12.00, one serving of chips for £4.50, and nine 330 ml glass bottles of Coke for £36.00.Police in Northamptonshire acknowledged that they are looking into the event as a possible theft.""This kind of behavior isn't just theft; it affects hardworking small businesses and our local community,"" they wrote in a Facebook post.Online, the post generated a range of responses. ""Eat at home if you can't afford it! One user asked, ""Why are people these days so lazy to cook?""“This is why you swipe a card before they’re seated. They don’t look like they can afford a McDonald’s, never mind a £200 restaurant bill,"" added the other user.","Four men in Northampton, England, raced away from an Indian restaurant without paying their 200-pound (about Rs 21,000) bill, which led to a spectacular chase by the staff.

List of UK cities in drought



UK government's 7 tips on how to save water at home



Install a rain butt to collect rainwater to use in the garden Fix a leaking toilet -- leaky loos can water 200-400 litres a day. Use water from the kitchen to water your plants. Avoid water in your lawn-- brown grass will grow back healthy. Turn off the taps when brushing teeth or shaving. Take shorter showers. Delete old emails and pictures as data centers require vast amounts of water to cool their systems.





The UK government has asked its people to delete old emails to play their part in not wasting water as the current drought situation has been defined as a ""nationally significant incident"". Old emails, photos stored in data clouds require vast data centers and they consume large amounts of water to keep cool.The advice was issued as Britain endures its fourth heatwave of the summer. Five areas of England are currently officially in drought, with six more in 'prolonged dry weather'.""The current situation is nationally significant, and we are calling on everyone to play their part and help reduce the pressure on our water environment,"" Helen Wakeham, the Environment Agency's director of water, said.""We are grateful to the public for following the restrictions, where in place, to conserve water in these dry conditions.""Simple, everyday choices – such as turning off a tap or deleting old emails – also really helps the collective effort to reduce demand and help preserve the health of our rivers and wildlife.""Drought has been declared in Yorkshire, Cumbria and Lancashire, Greater Manchester, Merseyside and Cheshire, East Midlands, and the West Midlands. Areas categorised as having had ""prolonged dry weather"" (the phase before drought) are: Northeast, Lincolnshire and Northamptonshire, East Anglia, Thames, Wessex, Solent and South Downs.Hosepipe bans are still in place for all Yorkshire Water customers along with some customers of Thames Water, South East Water and Southern Water.","The UK government has asked its people to delete old emails to play their part in not wasting water.

Zara Tindall spent the weekend competing at the NAF Five Star International Hartpury Horse Trials in Gloucestershire. Beside the warm-up ring, her 11-year-old daughter Mia watched closely, smiled for photos, and reached up to stroke one of Zara’s horses. The small moments told their own story. Mia looks at home around the stables.Zara rode two familiar partners at Hartpury. She brought Showtime, known in the yard as “Cracker,” and Class Affair, nicknamed “Socks.” Between rounds, Mia stayed close, chatting with her mum and keeping an eye on the action. It was a simple family scene at a busy event.The outing fits a long family pattern. Zara is an Olympian who has spent most of her life around eventing. Her mother, Princess Anne, was the first royal to compete at the Olympics. Her late grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, was a lifelong horsewoman. Seeing Mia comfortable in that world feels natural, and it hints at a next chapter for the Tindalls’ eldest child.Crowd shots from Hartpury showed Mia following each phase and cheering from the ropes. She watched showjumping from close enough to see take-off strides and leaned forward during cross-country updates.Nothing about it felt forced. It looked like a child enjoying her mum’s sport.The event itself is a regular stop for Zara. It draws strong fields across levels and gives riders a good mid-season test. This year she balanced competition with being present for her daughter, and the cameras picked up that easy rhythm. A rider’s focus can be intense on show days. Zara still made space for quick smiles with Mia before heading back to the horsebox.There was also a small stable-side detail that fans loved. Mia reached up to pat Showtime and grinned as the horse flicked an ear toward her. Little gestures like that say more than any speech about where a child’s interests might lead. No one is mapping out her future, but comfort around horses often starts with moments like this.Zara has said before that all three of her children have been on a pony. That early exposure shows. Mia moved around the yard with confidence, giving the horses space when needed and stepping back when grooms asked. It is the kind of quiet horsemanship children pick up by being around good yards.Mother and daughter also offered a simple picture of support. When Zara finished a round, Mia was there. When the next phase approached, Mia made way so the team could work. For families who live the show circuit, that balance is familiar. It is how many young riders begin, watching first, riding later.The photos from Hartpury will add to Mia’s growing gallery of equestrian days out. For now, it is enough to see interest and joy. If she chooses to ride more in public, she will have a mother who understands the sport at the highest level and a family who know how to blend normal life with busy weekends on the road.Hartpury offered a gentle reminder of what this family values. Horses, routine, and time together. One weekend, two good horses, and a child who could not stop watching. That was the story from the rails, and it was easy to read.","Zara Tindall spent the weekend competing at the NAF Five Star International Hartpury Horse Trials in Gloucestershire.

Residents of the Oxfordshire town of Charlbury were met with an unusual sight this week when a van bearing an altered image of US vice president JD Vance drove through its streets.The picture showed Vance bald in a style widely used in internet memes and was displayed prominently on the vehicle.The stunt was organised by the British political campaign group ‘Everyone Hates Elon’ and took place near where Vance was reportedly holidaying with his family, reports news agency Reuters.The meme has been circulating online for months, gaining extra attention after Vance’s remarks during a White House meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.While the image is generally treated as humorous online, it has been linked to a recent controversy involving a Norwegian tourist.In June, 21-year-old Mads Mikkelsen claimed he was denied entry to the United States at Newark Liberty International Airport after immigration officers discovered the bald Vance meme on his phone. He said he was detained, questioned about drug trafficking and extremism, and pressured to unlock his phone under threat of fines or imprisonment.US customs and border protection later issued a statement denying that the meme played any role in Mikkelsen’s refusal of entry.They said the real reason was his admitted past drug use, dismissing suggestions of political motives.Mikkelsen alleged the experience was humiliating, involving strip-searches, fingerprinting, and errors in his travel records, including his Norwegian passport being incorrectly marked as Spanish.Vance has acknowledged the memes himself, telling The Blaze that he finds them funny.","A van bearing an altered image of US vice president JD Vance drove through Charlbury, Oxfordshire.

Princess Anne is celebrating her 75th birthday with a fresh look and her signature sparkle. A new portrait released ahead of the milestone shows the Princess Royal standing alongside her husband, Vice Admiral Sir Tim Laurence. The photograph was taken before the French state banquet at Windsor Castle in July.The first thing people will notice is her hair. Anne has worn a similar bouffant style for about five decades. In this portrait she switches to a smooth chignon. It is elegant, neat, and suits the formal setting. The change is rare for her, which is why the photo drew quick attention.Tiara is the second talking point in this portrait. Anne chose the Festoon Tiara, a long-time favorite in her rotation. She received it as a gift in 1973 after christening a ship for the Worldwide Shipping Group. The design sits low and balanced, which works well with the new hair. Together they create a cleaner frame around her face.The portrait also doubles as a quiet nod to partnership. Sir Tim stands with her, as he often does at major state events. The two married in 1992 and keep a low profile. Their presence together in the birthday image sets a warm tone as family plans take shape for the coming weeks.There is context behind the timing. The palace shared the photo one week before her August 15 birthday to start the celebrations. It was shot by royal photographer Chris Jackson. He captured it at Windsor before the banquet held for the French state visit from July 8 to 10. The result is formal but relaxed, a look that fits Anne’s usual style.Fashion notes aside, the image also lands after a busy and challenging year. Anne remains one of the most active working royals by engagement count. Last year she briefly stepped back after a horse-related incident near her home. She returned to duties and later said the experience was a reminder that each day is a bonus. The new portrait, bright and composed, underlines that message without a single word.Reactions so far focus on two themes. Many like seeing a small style reset that still feels like Anne. Others appreciate the continuity of the Festoon Tiara, a piece linked to her early twenties and worn across decades. It is a simple mix of new and old. That balance is what people expect from her.As the birthday week begins, more pictures and appearances are likely. For now, one frame does the job. New hair. A classic tiara. Her husband at her side. It is a quiet portrait that still says a lot about how Anne works, dresses, and shows up for the role she has held for most of her life.","Princess Anne is celebrating her 75th birthday with a fresh look and her signature sparkle.

Is India part of the new countries list?



History of 'deport now, appeal later' policy







The UK government is expanding its deportation policy for criminals as part of its ongoing migration crackdown. The government aims to extradite foreign offenders more swiftly by including additional countries in the existing scheme.On Saturday, the government announced its intention to deport criminals immediately after sentencing under the ""deport now, appeal later"" policy, Independent reported.Earlier only 8 countries were in the list, where offenders were deported. Now this list expanded to 23 countries. And yes, India is also one of them.The current government planned to expand the partnership. Previously, offenders were returned to Finland, Nigeria, Estonia, Albania, Belize, Mauritius, Tanzania, and Kosovo for remote hearings. The additional countries include Angola, Australia, Botswana, Brunei, Bulgaria, Canada, Guyana, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Latvia, Lebanon, Malaysia, Uganda, and Zambia, with further countries expected to be added.he Home Office stated that this measure is ""the government's latest tool in its comprehensive approach to scaling up our ability to remove foreign criminals,"" highlighting that there have been 5,200 removals of foreign offenders since July 2024, marking a 14% increase compared to the previous year.Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated, ""Those who commit crimes in our country cannot be allowed to manipulate the system, which is why we are restoring control and sending a clear message that our laws must be respected and will be enforced."" Foreign Secretary David Lammy added, ""We are leading diplomatic efforts to increase the number of countries where foreign criminals can be swiftly returned, and if they want to appeal, they can do so safely from their home country. Under this scheme, we're investing in international partnerships that uphold our security and make our streets safer.""Both ministers had opposed the hostile environment policy while in opposition. In 2015, Sir Keir Starmer questioned the policy's viability, noting that in-person appeals had been the norm for two centuries and were a ""highly effective way of resolving differences.""He also expressed concerns about the impact on children if parents were deported and subsequently returned following a successful appeal. In today’s announcement, the prime minister's administration emphasized its goal to prevent individuals from ""gaming the system"" and to clamp down on those remaining in the UK for extended periods while their appeals are processed.This approach was first introduced in 2014 when Baroness Theresa May served as home secretary, forming part of the Conservative government's hostile environment policy to reduce migration. Under Section 94B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, the policy led to the return of hundreds of individuals to countries such as Kenya and Jamaica.In 2017, the Supreme Court effectively halted the policy after it was challenged on human rights grounds, citing that appeals from abroad did not comply with human rights standards.In 2023, then home secretary Suella Braverman reinstated the policy after establishing more facilities abroad for lodging appeals.","The UK government is expanding its deportation policy for criminals as part of its ongoing migration crackdown.

"Killed in a road rage incident, man's family uses AI to bring him to courtroom",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/killed-in-a-road-rage-incident-mans-family-uses-ai-to-bring-him-to-courtroom/articleshow/121047117.cms,"A screenshot from a video created by AI to mimic the likeness of Christopher Pelkey. The video was played during his killer’s sentencing in court, in a recreation of Pelkey’s own voice. In it, ‘Pelkey’ expressed forgiveness to the shooter





The letters came streaming in: from battalion brothers who had served alongside Christopher Pelkey in Iraq and Afghanistan, fellow missionaries and even a prom date. A niece and nephew addressed the court.Still, the voice that mattered the most to Pelkey's older sister, Stacey Wales, would most likely never be heard when it was time for an Arizona judge to sentence the man who killed her brother during a 2021 road rage episode - the victim's.Wales, 47, had a thought. What if her brother could speak for himself. And what would he tell Gabriel Horcasitas, 54, convicted of manslaughter? The answer came on May 1, when a likeness of her brother appeared on an 80-inch screen, the same one that had previously displayed autopsy photos of Pelkey and footage of his being fatally shot at an intersection in Arizona.It was created with AI.""It is a shame we encountered each other that day in those circumstances,"" the AI avatar said. ""In another life, we probably could have been friends. I believe in forgiveness and in God, who forgives. I always have and I still do."" While AI's use has spread through society, its use during the sentencing of Horcacitas, who got the maximum 10 and a half years in prison, appeared to be uncharted. Critics said the introduction of AI in legal proceedings could open the door to manipulation and deception.One thing was certain: The nearly four-minute video made a favourable impression on the judge. ""I loved that AI,"" judge Todd Lang said.""Thank you for that. And as angry as you are, and justifiably angry as the family is, I heard the forgiveness. And I know Horcasitas appreciated it, but so did I."" The video opened with a disclaimer. ""Hello, just to be clear, for everyone seeing this, I am a version of Chris Pelkey recreated through AI that uses my picture and voice profile... I was able to be digitally regenerated to share with you today.""Wales had been preparing her victim's impact statement for two years, but it was missing a critical element. ""I kept hearing what Chris would say."" She enlisted the help of her husband and their business partner, who had used AI to help corporate clients with presentations. They took Pelkey's voice from a video they had found of him speaking after completing treatment for PTSD at a facility for veterans. For his face and torso, they used a poster of Pelkey from a funeral service, digitally trimming his thick beard, removing his glasses and editing out a logo from his cap. Wales said she had written the script read by the AI likeness of her brother. ""I know AI can be used nefariously... But this was just another tool used to tell Chris's story."" A spokeswoman for county attorney said the office was not aware of AI being used. A defence lawyer said it would've been difficult to block the video from being shown. ""... However, this may be a situation where they just took it too far.""","Video created by AI to mimic likeness of Christopher Pelkey.

House GOP Chairman demands unredacted files in Kilmar Abrego Garcia’s case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/house-gop-chairman-demands-unredacted-files-in-kilmar-abrego-garcias-case/articleshow/121046196.cms,"House GOP chairman demands unredacted files in Kilmar Abrego Garcia’s case (Picture credit: AP, X/@RepMarkGreen)





House homeland security Chairman Mark Green is pressing Tennessee authorities to hand over unredacted video and reports tied to a 2022 traffic stop involving Kilmar Abrego Garcia, reported the New York Post Garcia is a Salvadoran national wrongly deported to El Salvador in March under the Trump administration.Green’s request follows growing questions over the federal handling of Abrego Garcia’s case, which has become a flashpoint in debates over immigration and due process.Edited police bodycam footage, cited by Fox News, shows Abrego Garcia being pulled over by the Tennessee Highway Patrol while transporting eight other individuals in a van.A trooper is heard suggesting that Abrego Garcia was “hauling these people for money,” sparking suspicions of human trafficking. However, the 29-year-old was let go with a citation for driving with an expired license.A source cited by Fox said that redacted portions of the footage included troopers discussing whether to call immigration authorities. Though a call was made, federal agents reportedly did not respond at the scene.Abrego Garcia told officers he was driving to Temple Hills, Maryland, for construction work. It later emerged the vehicle’s owner, Jose Ramon Hernandez-Reyes, had been convicted in 2020 for migrant smuggling and allegedly employed Garcia multiple times to transport undocumented migrants. Hernandez-Reyes, currently in federal custody, told ABC News that he ran a smuggling “taxi service” and had hired Abrego Garcia frequently since 2015.Despite no charges from the stop, the Trump administration used the incident to portray Abrego Garcia as an MS-13 member However, his attorneys, including Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, deny any gang affiliation and highlight the lack of charges or criminal record. “There is no evidence of a crime in this footage,” Sandoval-Moshenberg was quoted as saying by CNN, insisting that Garcia’s deportation violated his right to due process.In 2019, a US immigration judge had ruled Garcia should not be deported to El Salvador, citing gang threats to his life. Nonetheless, he was mistakenly expelled in March and initially held in the CECOT megaprison.The Supreme Court has since upheld a lower court’s order for his return. Yet, Trump has refused to bring him back, citing alleged gang links.Green's letter also demands the names of FBI officials who declined to detain Garcia, saying the case reflects “reckless, open-borders policies” under the Biden-Harris administration.","House GOP chairman demands unredacted files in Kilmar Abrego Garcia’s case.

Eric Adams eyed Turkey trip to raise re-election funds: Documents,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/eric-adams-eyed-turkey-trip-to-raise-re-election-funds-documents/articleshow/121045653.cms,"New York mayor Eric Adams (Image: AP)





Mayor Eric Adams expressed interest in raising campaign donations from Turkish businessmen during a 2022 dinner, newly unsealed court documents in his dismissed corruption case have revealed.According to filings cited by the New York Post, Adams “welcomed the offer of foreign contributions” and directed a promoter to coordinate with one of his staffers to secure the funds for his 2025 re-election bid The revelations are part of a trove of 1,785 pages of court documents made public after a legal push by multiple media outlets. The documents detail the FBI’s wide-ranging investigation into Adams and offer insight into the evidence federal prosecutors were gathering before the case was abruptly dismissed in April.As per New York Post, the newly unsealed records show Adams attended the January 2022 dinner with two staffers, where the idea of a visit to Turkey to meet potential donors was discussed.The filing notes Adams encouraged further coordination to arrange the contributions, though the documents do not confirm whether the trip ever took place or any donations were received.The same set of filings also contains allegations that Adams misled federal investigators about the location of his personal cellphone, which was seized during a raid on Gracie Mansion in September 2024.The FBI recovered multiple devices from his residence, including two iPads, a second iPhone, and an Iridium satellite phone on his nightstand.In a sworn affidavit, an FBI agent accused the mayor of “evidence of consciousness of guilt,” alleging he intentionally hid his phone and made false statements because he feared the device could reveal evidence of other crimes. Adams reportedly told his lawyer he had forgotten the phone’s passcode and provided an incorrect one.The original five-count indictment against Adams, unsealed last September, accused him of accepting over $100,000 in undisclosed gifts and luxury travel in exchange for political favours. Prosecutors also alleged he pressured the FDNY to approve permits for the Turkish consulate building in Manhattan despite safety concerns.Adams was accused of using straw donor schemes to tap into millions in matching campaign funds, reported CBS News.Though Adams has denied all wrongdoing, the case led to significant fallout. Four deputy mayors and several federal prosecutors resigned following the controversial dismissal request, which Judge Dale Ho criticised as a political bargain, citing alleged concessions over immigration policy.Ho ultimately ruled the case would not return to court, describing the DOJ’s motion to dismiss as “smacking of a bargain” and saying it wasn’t fair to let the matter hang over the mayor during an election year.Despite the scandal, Adams met with US President Trump at the White House Friday to discuss what he called “key priorities” for New York City, even as questions around his conduct continue to linger.",New York Mayor Eric Adams was accused of accepting gifts and travel in exchange for political favours.

The Trump administration is considering cutting the steep 145% tariff on Chinese imports by more than half, possibly as early as next week, as US and Chinese officials gear up for high-level trade talks in Switzerland,reported, citing sources close to the negotiations.US officials are reportedly weighing a reduction of the levy to somewhere between 50% and 54%, a move aimed at easing tensions as trade negotiations unfold. The proposed cut, according to, would be accompanied by a separate plan to lower tariffs on imports from neighbouring South Asian countries to 25%.“They are going to be bringing it down to 50% while the negotiations are ongoing,” a source was quoted as saying byUS President Trump hinted at the potential tariff shift during a meeting with UK officials in the Oval Office, stating, “It’s at 145 so we know it’s coming down,” while expressing optimism over US-China ties. “I think we’re going to have a very good relationship,” he added. Retail industry leaders , including Walmart’s Doug McMillon, Target’s Brian Cornell, and Home Depot’s Ted Decker, reportedly urged Trump to consider easing the tariff burden during an April 21 meeting at the White House.Though the executives described the session as “productive” and “constructive,” no specific outcomes were disclosed.Retailers have since started preparing for a range of tariff outcomes. Jay Foreman, CEO of toy company Basic Fun, was quoted bythat many are now asking vendors to quote prices based on tariffs between 10% and 54% to ensure flexibility.He added that a 54% levy would still push prices up significantly, such as a Tonka truck jumping from $29.99 to $49.99 but that’s “workable.” A 145% tariff, however, would push the price to nearly $80, which he warned would “bring sales to a virtual standstill.”Nick Mowbray, CEO of toy brand Zuru, said “the speculation is 54%,” but noted that it has “definitely not been told explicitly to retail yet.”Meanwhile, White House dismissed the tariff rollback talk as speculation, reported the news agency. “When decisions on tariffs are made, they will come directly from the President. Anything else is just pure speculation,” said a White House spokesperson.Still, retail executives say treasury secretary Scott Bessent’s recent remarks at the Milken Institute Global Conference, that the current rate “isn’t sustainable”, gave them confidence that a shift is imminent.Lawrence Rosen, chairman of Cra-Z-Art, confirmed tothat retailers are hearing similar figures, “We are hearing China at 50% to 54% and other Asian countries at 25%.”Foreman revealed that Basic Fun has seven containers en route to the US under the 145% rate and plans to store them to avoid the costly levy. The rest remain in warehouses, awaiting green light.Noel Hacegaba, COO at the Port of Long Beach, said hopes are high the Switzerland talks will help “de-escalate growing trade tensions,” but stressed that shippers need “a strong signal” before adjusting supply routes.Retail expert Gerald Storch, former CEO of Toys R Us, toldthat since the White House meeting, retailers seem “less panicked” and have slightly “relaxed” their urgency for domestic sourcing.While the situation remains fluid, the toy industry, with 80% of US toy sales coming from China and broader retail sector are closely watching for any official word from Trump in the coming days.","The Trump administration is considering cutting the steep 145% tariff on Chinese imports by more than half, possibly as early as next week.

Kash Patel cancels FBI morning meetings as he's mostly late: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kash-patel-cancels-fbi-morning-meetings-as-hes-mostly-late-report/articleshow/121041513.cms,"Kash Patel has been accused of changing decades-old schedule of FBI directors.

Badmouthing campaign against Patel



Kash Patel says he wants more budget, withdraws demand







FBI directors, for decades, have been holding a morning meeting daily at 8.30 am. But Kash Patel takes the meeting two days a week as 'sometimes he failed to arrive on time', an NBC News report said, citing officials who worked on Kash Patel's schedule. FBI spokesperson Ben Williamson denied that there was a change in the schedule because Patel was late. He said Patel still attends five morning meetings each week, including three that are smaller than the usual director's brief.FBI directors used to hold a teleconference with the leaders of the field officers on Wednesdays. Patel has discontinued that over leaking attempts but he's in close touch with the leaders.Kash Patel is facing a volley of attacks over his office timing, his trips, his frequent presence at sporting events -- of late. A former FBI official recently commented on MSNBC's Morning Joe that Patel is spotted more at nightclubs than in the office. The statement had to be retracted by MSNBC which said it did not verify the statement.Williamson said he meets Kash Patel every day in the office and hence the allegations that Patel is not in the office and working remotely from his home in Las Vegas were bogus.A friend of Patel told NBC that the only thing that Patel is doing late into the night is going to the gym.Countering allegations that Patel is not serious about the job, one FBI official told NBC that these are not even remotely true. “I myself am with him in many of these meetings. He asks tons of questions and pushes staff to get to the point and present solutions,” said the official. “To a bad-faith individual who loves to bloviate and gossip to NBC News, that might come off as lack of interest. It’s not. It’s being efficient with time and wanting to fix problems. ”Kash Patel asked for more money from the government for his agency -- $1 billion more than what the White House said.This raised speculations whether staunch Trump-supporter Patel was showing independence but a day later, he told senators that he agreed with the White House budget and will make it work.","Kash Patel is facing a volley of attacks over his office timing, his trips, his frequent presence at sporting events -- of late.

Air traffic controllers for Newark airport briefly lose radar access again,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/air-traffic-controllers-for-newark-airport-briefly-lose-radar-access-again/articleshow/121047277.cms,"A control tower is seen at Newark Liberty International Airport in Newark, NJ (AP photo)





The air traffic controllers directing planes into the Newark, New Jersey, airport briefly lost their radar Friday morning for the second time in two weeks, renewing concerns about the nation's aging air traffic control system that President Donald Trump wants to overhaul.The Federal Aviation Administration said the radar at the facility in Philadelphia that directs planes in and out of Newark airport went black for 90 seconds at 3:55 a.m. Friday. That's similar to what happened on April 28.That first radar outage led to hundreds of flights being canceled or delayed at the Newark airport in the past two weeks after the FAA slowed down traffic at the airport to ensure safety. Five controllers also went on trauma leave after that outage, worsening the existing shortage.It's not clear if any additional controllers will go on leave now.The number of cancellations and delays spiked after the FAA limited traffic at Newark and has remained high since then. The FAA said Newark is one of the most delay-prone airports in the nation right now. In addition to all the technical and staffing challenges, an ongoing runway construction project is adding to the disruptions.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a briefing Friday that the ""glitch this morning at Newark"" was caused by the same issues as last week.The latest Newark problems reinforce the need for the multibillion-dollar plan Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced Thursday to replace the nation's aging air traffic control system, Leavitt said. The plan is designed to prevent such problems from happening and give controllers modern technology. More than 4,600 new high-speed connections would be installed and 618 radars would be replaced across the country.Officials developed the plan to upgrade the system after a deadly midair collision in January between a passenger jet and an Army helicopter killed 67 people in the skies over Washington, D.C. Several other crashes this year also put pressure on officials to act.But the shortcomings of the air traffic control system have been known for decades. The National Transportation Safety Board has not determined that a problem with the air traffic control system caused the crash near Reagan National Airport.There has been an average of 34 arrival cancellations per day since mid April at Newark, and the FAA said the number of delays increases throughout the day from an average of five in the mornings to 16 by the evening. They tend to last 85 to 137 minutes on average.The FAA said the airport clearly cannot handle its current traffic, so it will propose cutting arrivals and departures to 28 each per hour until the runway construction is complete, and 34 per hour after the main runway project is completed, although some work will continue on the weekends.The FAA scheduled a formal meeting with all the airlines that fly out of Newark on Wednesday and Thursday of next week to talk about cutting their schedules while the staffing and technology issues persist.These radar outages in such a crowded airspace are alarming because seconds matter, but Allied Pilots Association spokesman Capt. Dennis Tajer said ""it's not an impending disaster that some are suggesting.""""The system is wired to run really well when everything's functioning. But the most important part is that it's prepared to function when things go wrong,"" Tajer said. ""Even when it sounds frightening, know that the air traffic controllers and the pilots have training and we go to that.""When pilots lose contact with controllers their first action is to continue on their last-directed path, but if the outage continues, pilots will start broadcasting their position to every other plane in the area - much like pilots do at small airports that don't have a control tower.U.S. Rep. Josh Gottheimer blamed the problems that have plagued Newark on the lack of proper air traffic controller staffing and modern technology.""Our region is a key economic artery for our country. Yet this region ... one of the busiest air spaces in the world, as I mentioned, is running off a tower that's full of copper wire dating back to the 1980s with outdated and inefficient technology,"" Gottheimer said. He said the tower was built back in ""the Brady Bunch era"" in 1973.The FAA said it currently has 24 air traffic controllers assigned to handle the Newark traffic, but it wants to have 38. And now several of those are on leave. Plus, 16 of the controllers currently working in Philadelphia are only assigned there temporarily through July 2026 as part of the facility's move from New York that it made last summer. So the FAA is working to quickly certify as many of the 26 trainees currently working in Philadelphia as possible.The FAA said earlier this week that it is installing new fiber optic data lines to carry the radar signal between its facilities in Philadelphia and New York. Officials said some of the lines connecting those two facilities are outdated copper wire that will be replaced. But it's not clear how quickly those repairs can be completed.U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York said it's important that the FAA get the problems affecting the Newark airport fixed quickly.""Enough is enough. The connection between New York air space and the Philadelphia air traffic control center must be fixed now. The backup system that is not working must be fixed. Now,"" Schumer said. ""This is an air travel safety emergency that requires immediate and decisive action, not a promise of a big, beautiful unfunded overhaul that will take years to begin to implement.""",The radar at the facility in Philadelphia that directs planes in and out of Newark airport went black for 90 seconds at 3:55 a.m. Friday.

Mayor Eric Adams met US President Donald Trump at the White House on Friday in a meeting that Adams framed as a policy discussion but one that left behind more political questions than answers.Adams’ office said the visit aimed to push for federal support on infrastructure and social services. The mayor highlighted projects such as a wind farm off Long Island and plans for semiconductor manufacturing , saying in a video shared online, “We must have a dialogue with the White House.”However, Trump downplayed the meeting, telling reporters, “Almost nothing. He came in to say hello. He was very nice… I think he actually came in to thank me.”As reported by The New York Times, the timing of the visit was sensitive. It came the same day nearly 2,000 pages of documents were unsealed related to Adams’ abandoned federal corruption case The files revealed that FBI agents and prosecutors were still seizing phones and pursuing search warrants in early February, just days before senior justice department officials intervened to shut the case down.Federal prosecutors had been investigating Adams since 2021 over campaign donations and free travel allegedly provided in exchange for political favours. Though Adams was charged last year, the case was dropped in February by Trump’s justice department, citing concerns it hindered Adams’ ability to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement.The move triggered resignations from at least eight federal prosecutors, including acting US attorney in Manhattan Danielle Sassoon.US district judge Dale E Ho later dismissed the charges but criticised what appeared to be a quid pro quo, “dismissal of the indictment in exchange for immigration policy concessions.”Since the case ended, Adams has not only avoided criticising Trump but has aligned himself with the administration.As per ABC New York, he previously agreed to re-open Rikers Island to ICE agents and met with immigration chief Tom Homan. In February, he defended his approach, “I can't get into a yelling match just because it feels good. I have to produce for this city.”Still, critics say the mayor’s closeness to Trump is troubling. “Adams already gave up his independence as mayor to save himself from criminal prosecution,” said state senator Zellnor Myrie, who is running against him. Comptroller Brad Lander called the mayor’s posture “the most humiliating capitulation imaginable.”","NY Mayor Eric Adams met US President Donald Trump at the White House on Friday.

White House says Donald Trump is eyeing habeas corpus suspension. What would it mean for migrants?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/white-house-says-donald-trump-is-eyeing-habeas-corpus-suspension-what-would-it-mean-for-migrants/articleshow/121045974.cms,"

What is habeas corpus?

The Hill.





President Donald Trump is considering suspending habeas corpus as part of a sweeping crackdown on immigration, according to White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller. Speaking to reporters outside the White House on Friday, Miller said the administration is “actively looking at” the option and suggested that it may be justified under the Constitution.“Well, the Constitution is clear, and that, of course, is the supreme law of the land, that the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus can be suspended in a time of invasion,” Miller said. “So I would say that's an option we're actively looking at. Look, a lot of it depends on whether the courts do the right thing or not.”Miller’s remarks are the clearest indication yet that Trump may invoke the clause in Article I of the Constitution which permits the suspension of habeas corpus “unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.”Miller argued that current immigration challenges amount to an “invasion” and said the courts have repeatedly overstepped their authority in immigration matters. “Congress passed a body of law known as the Immigration Nationality Act, which stripped Article 3 courts. .. of jurisdiction over immigration cases,” he said. “The courts are at war – these radical rogue judges – with the legislative branch as well, too.So all of that will inform the choice that the President ultimately makes.”Habeas corpus is a cornerstone of legal protections in the United States, requiring authorities to justify the detention of individuals before a judge. Migrants frequently use it to challenge deportations and prolonged detentions. The Constitution allows for its suspension only in extraordinary circumstances, such as rebellion or invasion.Legal experts have warned that any unilateral move by Trump to suspend habeas corpus would be unconstitutional. Georgetown law professor Steve Vladeck wrote, “The near-universal consensus is that only Congress can suspend habeas corpus – and that unilateral suspensions by the President are per se unconstitutional.” He added that “suggesting the administration would suspend habeas corpus if it disagrees with how courts rule in these cases” is not a viable constitutional argument, as reported byThe writ has only been suspended four times in US history: during the Civil War, Reconstruction in South Carolina, a 1905 insurrection in the Philippines, and following the attack on Pearl Harbor. In each case, the government cited a clear and immediate national security emergency.The Trump administration has already tested the limits of executive power by invoking the 1789 Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged gang members from Venezuela. But federal judges, including a Trump appointee, ruled those actions unlawful, stating the administration had not proven the US was under invasion.",White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller said the administration is “actively looking at’ the option. Miller argued that current immigration challenges amount to an “invasion” and said the courts have repeatedly overstepped their authority in immigration matters.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121045970,imgsize-1217905,width-400,resizemode-4/121045970.jpg"

NEW DELHI: For the Indian security establishment , the precision strikes on the nine terror camps were meant to be a stark message to LeT, JeM and Hizbul Mujahideen terrorists: ""We know you were behind the cowardly attacks, we know where you are and we can get you despite the protection you have from Pakistan army and ISI"".The missiles and niche loitering munitions used by the Army and IAF, besides claiming a toll of over 100, may have also eroded the terrorists' confidence in the security umbrella of Pakistan army and it tried to repair the damage by turning out in fatigues for the funeral of those killed, the source said.""As a possible corollary, they could leverage the frustration and insecurity of terrorists to incite them to launch attacks in India,"" the source said.As per the estimate of the security establishment here, the risk of terrorists trying to set off fresh attacks has risen also because of India's success in neutralising the efforts to breach its air defence and target its military facilities over the past 48 hours. ""They may fall back on the default option of using terror proxies to compensate for the failure of their forces,"" a senior govt functionary involved in decision-making said.""Tragic aberrations like the April 22 mass killing in Pahalgam notwithstanding, India has been very successful in thwarting terror attacks over the past 10 years.

NEW DELHI: Amid its widening hostilities with India, Pakistan army came under a sensational attack in South Waziristan, resulting in the death of 20 security personnel. Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) claimed responsibility for the attack.Two more Pakistani soldiers were killed in a clash with Baloch insurgents The attack by TTP took place on Thursday night on Pakistan military's Dawngate outpost in Shakai sub-division of South Waziristan, sources said. TTP claimed it was a multi-phase operation, initially killing six soldiers using laser-aided rifles after which a military convoy sent to support the besieged outpost was ambushed.According to the group, 20 security personnel were killed and five wounded.TTP accused Pakistan army of leaking coordinates of Jaish-e-Mohammed's Bahawalpur Markaz, which was targeted in an Indian air strike that killed 14, including 10 family members of JeM chief Masood Azhar. TTP spokesman Md Khorasani expressed grief over the incident, criticising Pakistan army as a ""traitorous and pro-Western"" group that provided the information leading to the attack.Khorasani described Pakistan army as a ""professional killer group"" that served foreign interests at the expense of its own people.He accused Pakistan army of ""handing over mujahideen to infidels"", a reference to Osama bin Laden's killing in Abbotabad.On Friday evening, Baloch Freedom fighters launched coordinated attacks across various regions of Balochistan, targeting Pakistani forces and infrastructure. The attacks occurred in multiple locations, including Turbat, where a grenade attack targeted Pakistani forces in D Baloch area, and Quetta, where two grenade attacks hit Pakistani army posts in Hazarganji and Faizabad areas.The fresh attacks came two days after Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) targeted Pakistani military vehicle in Bolan. An IED blast killed at least eight soldiers, including a special operations commander. Six were critically injured. A week prior, 10 Pakistan army personnel were killed in an IED attack by BLA in Quetta.Pakistan is under mounting pressure as TTP and BLA have intensified their attacks. With tensions escalating on the Indian border, Pakistan finds itself increasingly cornered on three fronts. While TTP has launched ' Operation Khandak ' against Pakistani forces, BLA is using a mix of snipers, remote controlled explosions and ambushes to corner army personnel.","Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) claimed responsibility for the attack.

DHAKA: Hours after a bench of the Bangladesh high court ordered the release of Hindu monk Chinmoy Krishna Das on bail on Wednesday - five months after his arrest on charges of defaming the country's national flag - the interim govt filed a petition seeking a stay on the reprieve granted to the monk. The plea is scheduled to be heard on Sunday.Earlier in the day, the HC had issued its verdict following the final hearing on Chinmoy's bail application in a sedition case filed on Oct 31, 2024. The two-judge bench, comprising justice Md Atowar Rahman and justice Md Ali Reza, upheld its earlier ruling and asked the authorities why Chinmoy should not be granted bail, according to a court official. On Oct 31, a case was filed at the Kotwali police station in Chittagong, accusing Chinmoy and 18 others of disrespecting the Bangladesh national flag. The sedition case was lodged by Firoz Khan, former BNP general secretary of Chittagong's Mohora ward.Chinmoy was arrested at Dhaka's Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport on Nov 25. The following day, the local court in Chittagong sent him to jail after rejecting his bail plea.

Who is Chinmoy Krishna Das?

A Bangladesh court on Wednesday granted bail to former Iskcon leader Chinmoy Krishna Das in a sedition case , reported Bangladesh's The Daily Star.Das was arrested following a controversy that erupted when a sedition case was filed against him and 18 others in Chittagong on October 30 last year.The charges were linked to the hoisting of a saffron flag above Bangladesh's official flag during the October 25 rally at Laldighi Maidan in Chattogram.Das was presented before a Chittagong court on Tuesday, where his bail plea was denied, and he was sent into custody. The arrest has triggered widespread outrage, with many demanding his immediate release.Das serves as the spokesperson for the Bangladesh Sammilita Sanatani Jagran Jote , a group that champions the rights and security of minorities. He has been a vocal advocate for the Hindu (Sanatani) community in Bangladesh, calling for key reforms such as a minority protection law, a tribunal for fast-tracking cases of minority persecution, and the establishment of a dedicated ministry of minority affairs.He gained widespread attention for organising large public rallies, including one in Chittagong on October 25 and another in Rangpur on November 22, which sparked significant socio-political discussions across the country.Das hails from Satkania Upazila in Chittagong. From 2016 to 2022, he was the Chittagong divisional secretary of Iskcon. He gained popularity at an early age for his religious speeches and earned the nickname of ‘Shishu Bokta’, or ‘child orator’, reports Bangladeshi media.",Chinmoy Krishna Das is a former Iskcon leader.

LONDON: India’s high commissioner to the UK Vikram Doraiswami has said that India’s conflict with Pakistan could end right now if Pakistan takes the opportunity of an “off-ramp”.“If Pakistan stops attacking our military facilities, the matter ends there. But it is for them to decide,” he told Sky’s Yalda Hakim on Thursday.“We have made it abundantly clear we are not looking for an escalation. But if Pakistan responds, we will respond along exactly the same lines. We did not attack their military. As they have now started trying to attack our military bases, we have hit back at their air defence systems.”He said the original escalation was the Pakistan-sponsored terrorist attack at Pahalgam.“Our response was focused solely on terrorist infrastructure. The object of this exercise was clearly to avoid military escalation.”Hakim referred to a Reuters report claiming Pakistan aircraft had shot down Indian fighter jets. “There is no evidence of that. We haven’t confirmed any such thing,” he said.“You had the Pakistan defence minister on your show who said the evidence for that was on social media. If it satisfies Pakistan’s ego to say they have done something, they could have used that as an off-ramp . But they chose not to and have continued to escalate. What is Pakistan retaliating about? They are retaliating against attacks on terrorism infrastructure so what does that tell you of their relationship with terror groups?”Asked if India was concerned at the loss of a Rafale jet, he said “We don’t know if this has happened.As a famous British admiral once said, the purpose of military hardware is that it has been used. If Pakistan escalates, we have the capacity to really punish them harder.”When asked if India funded the Baloch Liberation Army, he pulled out a photo of US-designated terrorist Hafiz Abdul Rauf, brother of JeM chief Masood Azhar, at a funeral for terrorists killed in Operation Sindoor, with the Pakistani military present and coffins draped in Pakistan’s national flag.“If you are going to give terrorists state funerals, what does that make of your system? The simple solution is for the international community to tell Pakistan it has an opportunity for an off-ramp. The world should have compelled Pakistan 30 years ago to take down this infrastructure. They have not done so.”","Vikram Doraiswami says if Pakistan stops attacking our military facilities, the matter ends there. “We have made it abundantly clear we are not looking for an escalation.

US president Donald Trump on Thursday confirmed a trade framework with the United Kingdom that reduces tariffs on autos and metals while keeping the baseline 10% tariff as it is. The announcement followed a phone call with UK prime minister Keir Starmer Under the plan, US tariffs on British cars will drop from 27.5% to 10% for a quota of 100,000 vehicles. Tariffs on steel and aluminium will be removed. In return, the UK will increase purchases of US agricultural goods, simplify customs for American products, and cut import taxes on around 2,500 items, including olive oil, wine, and sports equipment.The Republican president indicated that other countries negotiating trade deals with the US could face steeper import taxes.Referring to the UK’s 10% tariff rate, Trump said, “That’s a low number,” and argued that nations with which the US runs trade deficits—and which he claimed had treated the US unfairly—would be subject to higher tariffs.US stocks meanwhile surged Thursday as investor optimism grew following the announcement of the trade deal between the United States and the United Kingdom that could ease recession fears by lowering select tariffs and restrictions.Earlier, during simultaneous press conferences in London and Washington, Keir Starmer appeared via video link from the White House alongside Donald Trump, calling the US-UK trade agreement “a truly fantastic and historic day.”","US president Donald Trump confirmed a trade framework with the United Kingdom that reduces tariffs on autos and metals.

Poll Should the Bank of England adopt a more proactive approach to monetary policy? Yes, absolutely No, they should be cautious





LONDON: The Bank of England is widely expected to look past near-term inflationary pressures in the British economy and opt to cut interest rates on Thursday as a result of the potential shock to growth emanating from the tariff policies of the Trump administration.Most economists believe it's a near-certainty that the nine-member monetary policy committee will sanction a quarter-point reduction in the bank's main interest rate, to 4.25%. The decision is to be announced at 12:02 p.m., two minutes later than usual as a result of the two-minute silence for Victory in Europe Day. There's some speculation that some members may opt for an even bigger half-point cut.Economists are going to be particularly interested in the bank's accompanying economic forecasts as they will be the first since US President Donald Trump made his tariff announcement in early April.Though most tariffs were paused for 90 days following the ensuing market turmoil, including the 10% baseline tariff applied to UK goods entering the United States, the backdrop for the global economy remains highly uncertain.""With US trade policy presenting a new demand shock, there have been early signs that the MPC is willing to adopt a more proactive approach to loosening policy,"" said Edward Allenby, UK economist at Oxford Economics.The forecasts, particularly those regarding growth and inflation, will provide a steer as to whether a more proactive approach is likely. Since it started cutting interest rates in August 2024 from the 16-year high of 5.25%, the MPC has been consistent in lowering borrowing costs every three months.The imposition of US tariffs on British goods, and the potential for a wider global trade war, has the potential to weigh on growth as well as oil prices, which would consequently depress price pressures by lowering demand.Though UK inflation stands at 2.6% and could well hit double the bank's target rate of 2% in coming months as a result of a raft of price increases in April, such as domestic energy and water bills, economists think rate-setters will opt for a cut, given the anticipated slowdown.Unlike the Bank of England, and the European Central Bank, which last month cut interest rates too, the US Federal Reserve kept rates unchanged Wednesday as its policymakers wait to see how Trump's tariffs affect the US economy before making any moves.Inflation rates around the world are way down from levels seen a couple of years ago, partly because central banks dramatically increased borrowing costs from the near zero rates during the coronavirus pandemic. Prices then began to shoot up, first as a result of supply chain issues and later because of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which pushed energy costs higher.As inflation rates have declined from multidecade highs, central banks, including the Fed, have started cutting interest rates, though few, if any, economists think that rates will fall back to the super-low levels that persisted in the years after the global financial crisis of 2008-2009 and during the pandemic.","Bank of England is widely expected to cut interest rates on Thursday.

TOI CORRESPONDENT FROM LONDON: Despite the rhetoric that tensions between India and Pakistan might spill over onto Britain’s streets, things were calm on Wednesday and members of the Indian and Pakistani diaspora were all still getting on with each other.“Our fight is not against any community, religion, or nationality — it is against terrorism and the nations that sponsor it,” said a spokesman for British Indians Voice. He said the diaspora supported India’s military strike. “India has shown restraint for decades. This was not a reckless strike — it was a measured and necessary response to repeated acts of terror emanating from Pakistani soil. We stand with our homeland. It is time for the world to unite against terror. Because silence is no longer an option.”British Indian Santosh Patil said: “Terrorism has no place in a civilised society and anywhere where terrorist sympathising groups are based should meet the same fate. British Indians feel it is the right thing that happened as India attacked a terrorist group. We are still getting on with British Pakistani friends and neighbours.This is not an attack on Pakistan but on terrorism.”Ganapati Bhat, Kannadigaruuk president, said: “The whole community have a sense of justice being done because it was the worst of kind of terrorist attack on 22nd April and India has been at the receiving end of terrorism since Independence. Retaliation was not there previously, except for a couple of instances, and this time they have done it very well and eliminated this terrorist infrastructure so we feel satisfied. There is a bit of worry that things could impact trust issues among communities but I think people view Pakistan and terrorists as separate things. These things have been happening for over a decade, so I don’t see it spilling over into UK’s streets.”Amjid Ali Akram Jarral Rajput, a British Kashmiri with roots in J&K, said: “It’s dreadful what has happened.” He has family on both sides of border. “This is just another way to escalate what is happening and bring the world’s attention to Kashmir. This is due to what Britain did and the mess it left Kashmir in.”British Pakistani Murtuza Ali Shah, bureau chief for Geo News in the UK, said: “British Pakistanis are worried about their families in the region.” He said he did not see tensions playing out on UK streets. “We have all lived here a long time and fought racism together. Many of us are friends,” Shah said.","British Indian Santosh Patil said: “Terrorism has no place in a civilised society and anywhere where terrorist sympathising groups are based should meet the same fate.” British Pakistani Murtuza Ali Shah, bureau chief for Geo News in the UK, said he did not see tensions playing out on UK streets.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120974637,imgsize-953489,width-400,resizemode-4/120974637.jpg"

Working for GRU:

Like a 'spy novel':





Six Bulgarians, members of a sophisticated spy network dubbed ""The Minions"", were before court Wednesday for sentencing, facing up to 14 years in prison for spying for Russia The four men and two women either pled guilty or had been convicted of charges of conspiracy to spy at Russia's behest with their sentences due to be handed down on Monday, after four days of hearings at London's Old Bailey court.Between 2020 to 2023, the six-person cell targeted journalists and a Kazakh former politician, and plotted to kidnap and honeytrap targets, tracking them across several European nations.It was "" industrial-scale espionage on behalf of Russia"", Metropolitan police counter-terrorism Chief Commander Dominic Murphy said in March.Ringleader Orlin Roussev, 47, along with his second-in-command Bizer Dzhambazov, 43, and Ivan Stoyanov, 32, pled guilty to spying.Barrister for the prosecution, Alison Morgan, on Wednesday laid out their roles in different operations, stressing they knew they were spying for Moscow.London-based Katrin Ivanova, 33, Vanya Gaberova, 30, and Tihomir Ivanchev, 39, were convicted in March after a trial lasting more than three months at the Old Bailey court.Two of the group were in court on Wednesday, with the rest appearing by video link from their detention centres.They had dubbed themselves ""The Minions"" after the cartoon yellow characters in the film ""Despicable Me"" who work for the dastardly Gru. The six also worked for the GRU, the acronym for the Russian military intelligence service.The group launched operations in the UK as well as Austria, Spain, Germany and Montenegro.But UK police were able to retrace six operations thanks to more than 100,000 messages found on Roussev's Telegram account, which led police to his seaside home in the eastern town of Great Yarmouth.Roussev received his instructions from Jan Marsalek, an Austrian fugitive who reportedly fled to Russia in 2020 after becoming wanted for fraud in Germany.Marsalek, the former chief operating officer of payments firm Wirecard, was acting as a proxy for Russian intelligence services.One operation targeted investigative journalist Christo Grozev, from the Bellingcat website, who uncovered Russian links to the 2018 Novichok chemical weapon attack in the English town of Salisbury and the downing of a Malaysia Airlines aeroplane four years earlier.The group had planned ""disruptive activity"" at the Kazakh embassy in 2022, discussing a plan to spray the building with fake pig's blood.Roussev received more than 200,000 euros ($227,000) to fund his activities.After the gang was busted in February 2023, police found huge amounts of spyware equipment in his home, including cameras and microphones hidden in ties, a stone, even a cuddly toy and a fizzy drinks bottle.In messages to Marsalek, Roussev claimed ""he will find the resources"" to ""keep the Russians happy"" such as by kidnapping someone, Morgan said.""The defendants were deployed to gather information about prominent individuals whose activities were of obvious interest to the Russian state,"" she added.Murphy said in March that police had found ""really sophisticated devices -- the sort of thing you would really expect to see in a spy novel"".Journalist and UK-based dissident Roman Dobrokhotov, and former Kazakh politician Bergey Ryskaliev, granted refugee status in Britain, were also among their targets.The group also kept the US military base Patch Barracks in Stuttgart, Germany, under surveillance, believing Ukrainian soldiers were being trained there in using the Patriot air defence system.Ties between Britain and Russia have been strained since Moscow's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine.British security minister Dan Jarvis warned the convictions should ""send a clear warning to those who wish to do the UK harm"".","Six Bulgarians, members of a sophisticated spy network dubbed ""The Minions"", facing up to 14 years in prison for spying for Russia.

What sparked California's deadly wildfires? Investigators explore multiple causes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-sparked-californias-deadly-wildfires-investigators-explore-multiple-causes/articleshow/117134976.cms,"What can be the two primary causes



2017 Thomas Fire, amongst California's largest



What's causing Los Angeles' ferocious wildfires outside of the fire season? | ABC NEWS

Fires can originate from numerous sources



Fresh warning due to predicted windy conditions



Authorities are investigating multiple possible causes behind the massive wildfires that have claimed at least 11 lives and ravaged thousands of homes and commercial properties in the Los Angeles region.In the affluent, hillside neighborhood of Pacific Palisades , where Hollywood icons like Jamie Lee Curtis and Billy Crystal saw their homes destroyed by the fire, officials have traced the blaze's origin to an area behind a residence on Piedra Morada Drive, perched above a heavily wooded arroyo.The National Fire Protection Association notes that whilst lightning typically causes most fires in the United States, investigators quickly eliminated this possibility.No lightning activity was recorded near the Palisades area or around the Eaton Fire zone in eastern Los Angeles County, where hundreds of properties were also destroyed.The next two primary causes are deliberately set fires and those caused by utility lines. However, neither fire has been officially confirmed as arson, nor have utility lines been verified as the source.According to John Lentini, proprietor of Scientific Fire Analysis in Florida and investigator of significant California fires including the 1991 Oakland Hills Fire, the extensive nature of the blaze does not alter the investigative methodology.""This was once a small fire,"" Lentini said, Associated Press reported.""People will focus on where the fire started, determine the origin and look around the origin and determine the cause,"" Lentini added.Terrie Prosper, communications director at the California Public Utilities Commission, explained via email that utilities must report any ""electric incidents potentially associated with a wildfire."" CPUC staff subsequently investigate for possible legal violations.Investigators determined that the 2017 Thomas Fire, amongst California's largest, began when Southern California Edison power lines made contact during strong winds. This incident resulted in two fatalities and burnt over 440 square miles (1,140 square kilometres).Southern California Edison submitted a report to the CPUC regarding the Eaton Fire near Pasadena on Friday.Edison stated they received no indications of their equipment's involvement in starting the fire, but filed the report with state regulators as a precautionary measure after receiving evidence preservation notices from insurance lawyers.""Preliminary analysis by SCE of electrical circuit information for the energized transmission lines going through the area for 12 hours prior to the reported start time of the fire shows no interruptions or electrical or operational anomalies until more than one hour after the reported start time of the fire,"" the utility reported.Beyond lightning, arson and utility lines, debris burning and fireworks frequently cause fires. However, fires can originate from numerous sources, including accidents.In 2021, a gender reveal celebration sparked a significant fire that consumed nearly 36 square miles (about 90 square kilometres) of land, destroyed five homes and 15 other structures, and claimed firefighter Charlie Morton's life.As of Friday, both the Eaton and Palisades fires continued burning with minimal containment. Despite calmer winds, no rainfall was forecast as the flames spread through extensive dry areas.""It's going to go out when it runs out of fuel, or when the weather stops,"" Lentini said. ""They're not going to put that thing out until it's ready to go out.""Emergency services anticipated a respite on Friday from the strong winds that have driven substantial fires across Los Angeles, resulting in 10 fatalities, destroying residential areas and causing anxiety throughout America's second-largest city.Since Tuesday, the fires have destroyed over 10,000 buildings and residences across a heavily populated 25-mile (40-kilometre) area north of central Los Angeles. The primary causes of the major fires remain undetermined.Los Angeles Fire Chief Anthony Marrone indicated that whilst the current red flag warning concludes at 6 pm Pacific on Friday, authorities anticipate issuing a fresh warning on Monday due to predicted windy conditions.Los Angeles Lakers head coach JJ Redick shared his emotional response on Friday following team practice, discussing the fire's impact ahead of Saturday's scheduled match against San Antonio. ""I'm not sure I've wept or wailed like that in several years,"" Redick said.The rented residence in Pacific Palisades was destroyed on Tuesday whilst the team was in Dallas. His wife Chelsea and their two children were safely away from the affected area.""California is deeply grateful for President @ClaudiaShein’s support as we work to suppress the Los Angeles wildfires. Our partnership and shared commitment to helping communities in need is greatly valued,"" he wrote in a post on X.Governor Gavin Newsom initiated an investigation into the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power following reports of water pressure loss during firefighting efforts.""We need answers to how that happened,"" Newsom stated, describing ongoing reports of water shortages as ""deeply troubling.""","Authorities are investigating multiple possible causes behind the massive wildfires that have claimed at least 11 lives and ravaged thousands of homes and commercial properties in the Los Angeles region.

I acknowledged the heroism of Americans who are working tirelessly to save lives and contain the spread of these wildfires.""The call comes amid heightened concerns in Kyiv that President-elect Donald Trump, set to take office on January 20, may reduce US support for Ukraine.

""I also thanked him for the unwavering support of Ukraine’s independence and for the vital role the United States has played in uniting the international community,"" Zelenskyy tweeted.Biden has been a steadfast ally of Ukraine, providing billions of dollars in military aid and budget support to help Ukraine defend itself against Russian aggression. Recently, the US announced nearly $6 billion in new military and financial assistance.In addition to discussing the ongoing military support, the two leaders also focused on new sanctions aimed at Russia’s energy sector. Zelenskyy emphasized the significance of the sanctions, stating, ""We discussed the details of the new US sanctions package targeting Russia’s energy sector, which helps Putin bankroll the war. It is significant that these sanctions now strike at Russia’s shadow tanker fleet and key companies such as Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegaz, which funnel funds directly to Putin.""The Biden administration's efforts to provide Ukraine with military aid have been critical in maintaining Ukraine's defense against Russia's invasion, which continues to fail in achieving its strategic objectives.

We will undoubtedly stand firm and achieve a lasting peace for our people and our country.""The conversation also included discussions on strengthening Ukraine's air defenses to protect civilians from ongoing Russian missile and drone attacks.

Kamala Harris ‘competent to run again and could have beaten Trump’: Biden on presidential election,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kamala-harris-competent-to-run-again-and-could-have-beaten-trump-biden/articleshow/117135516.cms,"Harris lost to Trump in the November 5th presidential election. Harris has not announced her future plans yet.

US outgoing President Joe Biden endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris 's potential candidacy for the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination , asserting she was ""competent"" despite her significant defeat to President-elect Donald Trump.On Friday night, speaking just 10 days before his White House departure, Biden stated, ""I think she's competent to run again in four years. That will be a decision for her to make.""In 2020, Biden achieved a significant milestone by selecting Harris, making her the first Vice President of the United States who is of Indian American and African American heritage, as well as the first woman to hold this position.Following a poorly received presidential debate against Donald Trump in Atlanta during Summer 2024, Biden stepped down from the presidential race and gave his support to Harris, who subsequently secured the Democratic Party's nomination for president.However, in the November 5 election, Harris was unsuccessful in her bid against Trump for the presidency. She has yet to disclose what she intends to do next.The departing president initially avoided addressing questions about his own re-election bid during an evening press conference, where he had been discussing employment statistics, New York Post reported.Biden insisted, ""I think I would have beaten Trump, could have beaten Trump, and I think that Kamala could have beaten Trump, would have beaten Trump,"" whilst looking downwards, offering no explanation for Harris's loss in all seven battleground states.Addressing his withdrawal, Biden explained his priority was party unity, particularly following a poor June debate performance that sparked concerns about his cognitive abilities amongst fellow Democrats.""It was the greatest honour in my life to be president United States, but I didn't want to be one who caused a party that wasn't unified to lose an election,"" Biden elaborated, expressing confidence in Harris's capabilities.Harris, who secured the lowest Electoral College votes for any Democratic candidate since Michael Dukakis in 1988, had planned an international tour highlighting diplomatic achievements. However, she cancelled due to ongoing California wildfires.The planned itinerary included Singapore for Asian policy discussions, Bahrain for Middle Eastern affairs, and Germany to address NATO's response to Russia's Ukraine invasion.Biden concluded by announcing his intention to maintain public visibility post-presidency, unlike George W.

ISLAMABAD: Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Malala Yousafzai will attend an international summit on girls' education hosted by her native Pakistan, where she was nearly killed by militants as a schoolgirl.Yousafzai was evacuated from the country in 2012 after being shot by the Pakistan Taliban , who were enraged by her activism, and she has returned to the country only a handful of times since.A spokesperson for the Malala Fund charity confirmed Yousafzai will appear in person at the summit, which will focus on education in Islamic nations.""I am excited to join Muslim leaders from around the world for a critical conference on girls' education,"" she said on Friday in a post on social media platform X.""On Sunday, I will speak about protecting rights for all girls to go to school, and why leaders must hold the Taliban accountable for their crimes against Afghan women & girls.""Pakistan's education minister Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui told AFP the Taliban government in Afghanistan has been invited to attend, although Islamabad has not received a response.""Nevertheless, representatives from various organisations dedicated to girls' education in Afghanistan will be participating in the event,"" he said.Afghanistan is the only country in the world where girls and women are banned from going to school and university.Since returning to power in 2021, the Taliban government there has imposed an austere version of Islamic law that the United Nations has called "" gender apartheid "".Girls are only allowed to attend primary school, while women are largely restricted to working in segregated environments in health or education.The Taliban administration claims that Islamic law ""guarantees"" the rights of Afghan men and women.- Focus on Muslim world -The two-day summit backed by the Saudi Arabia-based Muslim World League will be held in the Pakistani capital on Saturday and Sunday and opened by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.It brings together ministers, ambassadors and religious scholars from 44 countries, as well as representatives from the UN and World Bank.Tens of millions of girls are out of school in Muslim-majority countries, including Bangladesh and Nigeria.Pakistan is facing a severe education crisis with more than 26 million children out of school, mostly as a result of poverty, according to official government figures -- one of the highest rates in the world.The summit will confirm ""the shared commitment of (the) Muslim community to empower girls through education"", according to a government statement.Yousafzai became a household name after she was attacked by Pakistan Taliban militants on a school bus in the remote Swat valley.Militancy was widespread in the region at the time as the war between the Afghan Taliban and NATO forces raged across the border in Afghanistan.The Pakistan and Afghan Taliban are separate groups but share close links and similar ideologies, including a strong disbelief in educating girls.Yousafzai was evacuated to the United Kingdom and went on to become a global advocate for girls' education and, at the age of 17, the youngest Nobel Peace Prize winner.",Malala Yousafzai will attend an international summit on girls' education in Pakistan.

Venezuela's Maduro takes new oath amid protests and international rebuke,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/venezuelas-maduro-takes-new-oath-amid-protests-and-international-rebuke/articleshow/117135079.cms,"Opponents of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro hold a banner that reads in Spanish: ""Venezuela, you're not alone"" at Plaza de Mayo in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Thursday, Jan. 9, 2025. (AP)

CARACAS: Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro was sworn in for a new term on Friday, extending his increasingly repressive rule in the face of renewed protests and rebukes from the United States and others who believe he stole last year's vote.Venezuela 's legislative palace, where he was sworn in and delivered a fiery speech, was heavily guarded by security forces who have become Maduro's main hold on power since last summer's disputed election. Crowds of people, many sporting pro-Maduro T-shirts, gathered in adjacent streets and a nearby plaza.Maduro, likening himself to a biblical David fighting Goliath, accused his opponents and their supporters in the U.S. of trying to turn his inauguration into a ""world war."" He said his enemies' failure to block his inauguration to a third six-year term was ""a great victory"" for Venezuela's peace and national sovereignty.""I have not been made president by the government of the United States, nor by the pro-imperialist governments of Latin America,"" he said, after being draped with a sash in the red, yellow and blue of Venezuela's flag. ""I come from the people, I am of the people, and my power emanates from history and from the people. And to the people, I owe my whole life, body and soul.""The backslapping among government insiders in downtown Caracas on Friday contrasted sharply with the hundreds of Venezuelans who took to the streets Thursday to protest Maduro's power grab.The protest took place in relative calm but after it ended, aides to the popular former lawmaker Maria Corina Machado - the driving force behind what's left of Venezuela's beleaguered opposition - said she was briefly detained by security forces. Machado, whom the government has barred from running for office, emerged from months of hiding Thursday to join rally against Maduro.On Friday, she posted a video online in which she described the confusing incident. She said national guardsmen fired shots on her convoy, then dragged her off a motorcycle from behind and said they were taking her to prison. She said her motorcycle driver was shot in the leg.But on the way to the military prison, the guards changed their minds and instead forced her to record a proof-of-life video denying her detention, she said.Maduro's supporters accused the opposition faction of spreading fake news to generate an international crisis. It pointed to the 20-second video it released on Thursday - in which Machado says she simply dropped her purse as she was being chased - as evidence that she was not detained.""Today Maduro didn't put the sash on his chest. He put a shackle on his ankle, which will tighten every day,"" Machado said on Friday.Maduro didn't mention Machado in his inaugural speech.State TV said 10 heads of state attended. But far more governments around the world have rejected his victory claims, pointing to credible evidence validated by election observers that his previously unknown opponent, Edmundo Gonzalez , won by a more than two-to-one margin.To underscore Maduro's growing isolation, the U.S., Canada, the U.K. and European Union announced a coordinated round of new sanctions Friday on more than 20 officials, accusing them of gutting Venezuela's democracy. They include the loyalist Supreme Court justices, electoral authorities, the head of Venezuela's state oil company and cabinet ministers.The Biden administration, citing Venezuela's ""severe humanitarian emergency,"" also extended for 18 months a special permission allowing 600,000 Venezuelan migrants to stay in the US. It also upped to $25 million a reward for the arrest of Maduro and Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello to face drug trafficking charges in the US, and placed a new bounty of $15 million on Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino .In a video recorded from the Dominican Republic and released on social media, Gonzalez thanked Venezuela's ""democratic friends"" for their support, citing the latest sanctions.""He's crowned himself a dictator,"" Gonzalez said of Maduro. ""The people don't support him, nor does any government that can call itself democratic.""Gonzalez said he will return to Venezuela once it is safe.Maduro's 2018 reelection was widely rejected as a sham after authorities banned key opponents from running. And Venezuela's opposition faction accuse him of outright ballot fraud last year.Their proof: tally sheets collected from 85% of electronic voting machines showing that Gonzalez won by a landslide. Experts from the United Nations and the Atlanta-based Carter Center, whom Maduro invited to observe the election, said the voting records posted online by the opposition look legitimate.Nevertheless, electoral authorities loyal to the ruling party declared Maduro the winner hours after polls closed on July 28 but, unlike in previous presidential contests, they did not provide detailed vote counts.Global condemnation over the lack of transparency prompted Maduro to ask the country's high court - which like every other institution in Venezuela is packed with loyalists - to audit the results. As expected, the court reaffirmed Maduro's victory.The dispute over the results sparked nationwide protests. The government responded with full force, arresting more than 2,000 demonstrators and encouraging Venezuelans to report anyone they suspect to be a ruling-party adversary. More than 20 people were killed during the unrest. Dozens of foreigners - including as many as 10 Americans - were also rounded up.Outside Friday's inauguration ceremony, Maduro's supporters were overjoyed. One of them was Maricarmen Ruiz , 18, who couldn't hold back her tears.""I don't have words to express my emotion, I'm happy,"" she said, expressing relief that Gonzalez wasn't ""imposed"" instead as president.Among those seen attending Maduro's inauguration were Nicaragua's Daniel Ortega and Cuba's Miguel Diaz-Canel. But several Maduro allies stayed home, including Colombian President Gustavo Petro, who cited the recent arrest of another longtime Venezuelan opposition member and a human rights defender as his reason for missing the event.Gonzalez, who left for exile in Spain in September, had pledged to defy an arrest order and return to Venezuela by Friday to take the oath of office himself. Doing so seemed impossible after Maduro ordered a 72-hour closure of Venezuela's air space and its border with Colombia. Machado, in her message Friday, said in light of Maduro's ""coup"" it was not advisable for him to return just now.On Tuesday, Gonzalez said his son-in-law had been kidnapped in Caracas by masked gunmen while taking his young children to school. Gonzalez's daughter, Mariana Gonzalez de Tudares, in a statement accused the government of ordering her husband's disappearance.""At what point did being related to Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia become a crime?"" she said.","Venezuela's legislative palace, where he was sworn in and delivered a fiery speech, was heavily guarded by security forces.

SC seems poised to uphold law to ban TikTok in US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/sc-seems-poised-to-uphold-law-to-ban-tiktok-in-us/articleshow/117135009.cms,"Callie Goodwin, of Columbia, SC, holds a sign in support of TikTok outside the Supreme Court, Friday, Jan. 10, 2025, in Washington. (AP)

WASHINGTON: The Supreme Court seemed inclined on Friday to uphold a law that could effectively ban TikTok, the wildly popular app used by half of the country.Even as several justices expressed concerns that the law was in tension with the First Amendment, a majority appeared satisfied that it was aimed not at TikTok's speech rights but rather at its ownership, which the government says is controlled by China. The law requires the app's parent company, ByteDance , to sell TikTok by Jan. 19. If it does not, the law requires the app to be shut down.The government offered two rationales for the law: combating covert disinformation from China and barring it from harvesting private information about Americans. The court was divided over the first justification. But several justices seemed troubled by the possibility that China could use data culled from the app for espionage or blackmail.""Congress and the president were concerned,"" Justice Brett Kavanaugh said, ""that China was accessing information about millions of Americans, tens of millions of Americans, including teenagers, people in their 20s.""That data, he added, could be used ""over time to develop spies, to turn people, to blackmail people, people who a generation from now will be working in the FBI or the CIA or in the State Department.""Noel J. Francisco, a lawyer for TikTok, said he did not dispute those risks. But he said the government could address them by means short of effectively ordering the app to, as he put it, ""go dark.""The court has put the case on an exceptionally fast track, and it is likely to rule by the end of next week. Its decision will be among the most consequential of the digital age, as TikTok has become a cultural phenomenon.The law, enacted in April with broad bipartisan support, said urgent measures were needed because ByteDance was effectively controlled by the Chinese government.TikTok has urged the court to strike down the law, saying that it violates both its First Amendment rights and those of its 170 million American users. It has repeatedly argued that a sale is impossible.The deadline set by the law falls one day before the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump. Last month, he asked the justices to temporarily block the law so that he could address the matter once in office.","Supreme Court seemed inclined on Friday to uphold a law that could effectively ban TikTok.

BREAKING: President-Elect Trump And Melania Visit Capitol Rotunda Where Jimmy Carter Lies In State

A funeral steeped in fashion, tension, and political drama

Melania Trump has made her return to Washington DC, but it wasn’t just her presence at the funeral of former president Jimmy Carter that caught attention—her outfit became the talk of the town.The 54-year-old former First Lady , joined by her husband, President-elect Donald Trump , was seen attending the National Cathedral service Thursday morning. As the couple sat in the front row, all eyes weren’t just on the ceremonial proceedings, but on Melania’s striking outfit.The ex-beauty queen chose a long-sleeve Valentino black coat dress with an oversized white collar, paired with a dramatic print of a 19th-century neoclassical sculpture of lovers sharing an intimate kiss. While the dress itself was a statement, it quickly became the center of heated discussions on social media.Some took to X (formerly Twitter) to share their harsh opinions. “WTF is Melania wearing? Did the nun store have a sale?” one person posted, comparing her to a “nun.” Another mocked the ensemble, calling it a “pilgrim outfit,” referencing the dress’s exaggerated collar. The critiques only escalated, with one user adding, “Looks like our next four years of ‘What the f--- is Melania wearing?’ starts today.”But the fashion criticisms didn’t end with the former First Lady’s attire. Her reappearance also saw her catch the eye of former Vice President Mike Pence’s wife, Karen Pence, who appeared to avoid any interaction with either Donald or Melania. Mike Pence, however, shook hands with both, despite his recent vocal criticism of Trump in his memoir, So Help Me God.Not just Melania, but the entire event became a spectacle of political tension. As President-elect Trump and Barack Obama were seen chatting amicably, viewers couldn’t help but wonder what was being discussed behind the scenes. But it was Melania’s fashion choice and the stark dynamics between former political allies that kept the audience intrigued.In a moment of unusual tension, Kamala Harris—seated just in front of the Trumps—arrived and deliberately avoided making eye contact with Donald Trump. “Kamala arrived, Trump kept staring at her, she wouldn’t look at him,” one social media user noted.For Trump, the funeral was a chance to pay his respects to Carter, but his usual political posturing continued. Just days before the service, he had taken a swipe at the late president's controversial decision to relinquish control of the Panama Canal to Panama. “Jimmy Carter gave it to them for $1, and they were supposed to treat us well,” Trump had said in a news conference. ""It was the most expensive structure ever built in the history of our country.""While the day was meant to honor a former president, it became a moment filled with political undercurrents and fashion-focused commentary. Melania Trump, typically known for her sharp style, once again found herself at the center of a cultural conversation—this time not for a diplomatic or fashion-forward choice, but for a polarizing outfit that turned heads for all the wrong reasons.",Melania Trump's outfit at Jimmy Carter's funeral became the talk of the town.

'Extraordinary protection': What Judge Merchan said while 'sentencing' Trump in hush money case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/extraordinary-protection-what-judge-merchan-said-while-sentencing-trump-in-hush-money-case/articleshow/117126043.cms,"Donald Trump (Agencies)

Here's what Judge Merchan said while 'sentencing' Trump: -



US President-elect Donald Trump was sentenced to an ' unconditional discharge ' on Friday in connection with his hush-money conviction, just days before his inauguration.Judge Juan Merchan, presiding over the case, pointed out the unique nature of the proceedings and the 'extraordinary legal protections' tied to the office of the presidency.“Never before has this court been presented with such a unique and remarkable set of circumstances,” Judge Merchan quoted by CNN. “This has been a truly extraordinary case.”While delivering the sentence, Judge Merchan clarified that the protections afforded to the presidency do not diminish the seriousness of Trump’s actions.“The considerable, indeed extraordinary legal protections afforded the office of the chief executive is a factor that overrides all others,” he said. “However, they do not reduce the seriousness of the crime or justify its commission in any way.”Merchan was unequivocal in mentioning that it is the office, not the individual, that is extraordinary. “It is the legal protections afforded to the office of the president of the United States that are extraordinary, not the occupant of the office,” he said.Merchan also reflected on equality, saying, “Once the courtroom doors closed, the trial was no different from any other in the courthouse,” he said.Trump, appearing virtually from his Florida club, is now the first individual convicted of a felony to assume the presidency.The case stemmed from accusations that he falsified business records to conceal a $130,000 payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels , who alleges an affair with Trump in 2006—a claim he denies, dismissing the prosecution as politically motivated.","Donald Trump was sentenced to an'unconditional discharge'on Friday in connection with his hush-money conviction.

Elon Musk: Hitler was a communist? Elon Musk sparks outrage in bizarre chat with AfD leader,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hitler-was-a-communist-elon-musk-sparks-outrage-in-bizarre-chat-with-afd-leader/articleshow/117126418.cms,"During a livestreamed chat on X with Alternative for Germany ( AfD ) co-leader Alice Weidel , billionaire Elon Musk appeared to make a shocking claim.Musk said Adolf Hitler , the fascist dictator of Germany from 1933 to 1945, was a communist, Daily Beast reports.Musk had been promoting the conversation with Weidel for days, and their meeting had already raised eyebrows due to his known leanings towards right-wing views and public support for the AfD.The discussion quickly turned strange, with Weidel claiming that “the biggest success after that terrible era in our history was to label Adolf Hitler as right[-wing] and conservative, he was exactly the opposite.” She went on to argue that Hitler “was a communist, a socialist guy, and we are the opposite.”Musk, appearing to agree, responded with brief affirmations like “yes, exactly.” This claim sharply contrasts with Hitler’s well-documented anti-communist stance, outlined in his autobiography Mein Kampf. In the book, Hitler criticised socialism and Marxism, calling them a Jewish conspiracy aimed at weakening Germany. He banned socialism, executed socialists, and, ironically, invaded the Soviet Union— a communist state—in 1941.The conversation also touched on free speech and media control, with Weidel claiming that “without [controlling] the media, Hitler would have never been successful.” This statement was made amid concerns from German intelligence agencies , who have been monitoring the chat to ensure it does not breach Digital Service Act rules ahead of next month’s snap election.Weidel, who is currently hoping to replace Olaf Scholz as German chancellor, has been gaining attention as the AfD remains in second place in the polls, with around 20% support. Musk, meanwhile, has shown support for right-wing figures such as Tommy Robinson in the UK and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. In a recent opinion piece for a German newspaper, Musk defended his ties to the AfD, arguing that their stance is often misrepresented, using Weidel’s same-sex partner from Sri Lanka as an example.German intelligence agencies, however, have long classified the AfD as a potential extremist group, viewing their positions as dangerous.","Elon Musk appeared to say Adolf Hitler was a communist during a livestreamed chat with Alternative for Germany ( AfD) co-leader Alice Weidel.

What Broke The U.S. Immigration System?

How Trump Plans to Deport 4% of the U.S. Population | WSJ

United States President Joe Biden on Friday extended the temporary legal status of about one million immigrants from El Salvadore, Venezuela and Ukraine, days ahead of Donald Trump's inauguration as the 47th American President.The Biden administration, in final acts on immigration policy, ratified an extension for over 200,000 Salvadorans and about 600,000 Venezuelans for another 18 months.The decision by the Biden government is in contrast with the immigration policy promised by Trump, who has vowed to crack down on non-natives. Biden administration's latest move in support of the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) sharply expanded cover to about 1 million people, reported news agency AP.The decision grants relief to roughly 232,000 Salvadorans; 1,900 Sudanese; 104,000 Ukrainians; and 600,000 Venezuelans, reported CNN citing Department of Homeland Security.Last year, Biden announced a new immigration policy which allowed spouses of American citizens to obtain legal status if they were illegal immigrants.The policy is applicable to those who have been residing in the country for not less than 10 years and are married to a US citizen before June 17, 2024. The White House expected the move to benefit at least 500,000 people in addition to some 50,000 stepchildren of US citizens.US President-elect Donald Trump is poised to intensify his crackdown on illegal immigration and restrict legal immigration when he returns to the White House on January 20, 2025.Trump reaffirmed his approach to immigration during a campaign rally in Duluth, Georgia, saying, ""Immediately upon taking the oath of office, I will launch the largest deportation program in American history.""Trump has announced plans to enact large-scale deportations if he returns to office. This initiative, aimed at individuals residing in the US illegally, seeks to return millions to their countries of origin. The president-elect intends to utilize executive orders to increase immigration enforcement immediately upon assuming office.","US President Joe Biden extended the temporary legal status of about one million immigrants from El Salvadore, Venezuela and Ukraine.

WAHINGTON: The United States and Britain on Friday announced sanctions against Russia's energy sector, including oil giant Gazprom Neft , just days before outgoing President Joe Biden leaves office.The US Treasury Department said it was designating more than 180 ships as well as Russian oil majors Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas, fulfilling ""the G7 commitment to reduce Russian revenues from energy.""At the same time, the UK government announced sanctions against the two companies, saying their profits were ""lining (Russian President Vladimir) Putin's war chest and facilitating the war"" in Ukraine.""Taking on Russian oil companies will drain Russia's war chest -- and every ruble we take from Putin's hands helps save Ukrainian lives,"" UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said in a statement.""Putin is in tough shape right now, and I think it's really important that he not have any breathing room to continue to do the god-awful things he continues to do,"" Biden told reporters Friday at the White House.Gazprom Neft slammed the sanctions as ""baseless"" and ""illegitimate,"" Russian state news agencies reported.""Gazprom Neft considers the decision to include its assets on the sanctions list as baseless, illegitimate and contrary to the principles of free competition,"" Russian state news agencies quoted a company representative as saying.Oil prices rose on the news, with a barrel of Brent North Sea crude oil for delivery in March up 3.6 percent at $79.68 at around 4:45 pm in Washington (2145 GMT).Asked about gasoline prices, Biden conceded costs could rise ""as much as three, four cents a gallon,"" but stressed that sanctions would have a ""more profound impact"" on Russia.- 'Sweeping action' -Even before the sanctions were officially announced, rumors of fresh designations sparked condemnation from Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, who told reporters that the Biden administration was trying to leave incoming US President Donald Trump ""as heavy a legacy as possible.""In total, the United States announced sanctions against almost 400 people and entities.These include 183 oil-carrying vessels, along with Russian oil traders and oilfield providers, the two Russian oil majors, and more than two dozen of their subsidiaries, according to the Treasury Department.Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic announced plans to speak with Putin about the sanctions, which also affect Petroleum Industry of Serbia (NIS), majority-owned by Russia's Gazprom Neft and its parent company, Gazprom.NIS is the only supplier of gas to Serbia and the majority owner of both gas pipelines that transport gas from Russia to households and industries in the country.""Today, the United States imposed the most significant sanctions yet on Russia's energy sector, by far the largest source of revenue for Putin's war,"" Daleep Singh, the Biden administration's deputy national security advisor for international economics, said in a statement.Senior administration officials told reporters the measures were designed to give the United States additional leverage to help broker a ""just peace"" between Ukraine and Russia.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky praised the United States for introducing the sanctions.""These measures deliver a significant blow to the financial foundation of Russia's war machine by disrupting its entire supply chain,"" he wrote in a post on the social media platform X.- Strong economy influenced timing -Friday's announcement comes just 10 days before Biden is due to step down, and puts President-elect Trump in something of an awkward position given his stated desire to end the Ukraine war on day one of his presidency.Asked about the timing, National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told reporters that oil markets were now in a ""fundamentally"" better place than they had been in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and that the US economy was also faring better.""We believe the moment was ripe right now to adjust our strategy,"" he said.The US State Department announced it was also taking action against Russia's energy sector, ""sanctioning nearly 80 entities and individuals, including those engaged in the active production and export of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Russia.""Among those it designated were people involved in Russia's metals and mining sector, ""and senior officials of State Atomic Energy Corporation Rosatom.""The move sparked condemnation from Rosatom, which called it ""unreasonable and unlawful"" in nature.""The sanctions are perceived as an element of unfair competition on the part of unfriendly states,"" Rosatom said in a statement published by several Russian news agencies.","U.S., UK announce sanctions against Russia's energy sector, including oil giant Gazprom Neft.

Seth Meyers: Seth Meyers rips Trump’s LA wildfire claims: ‘Water Restoration Declaration? Super f***ing made up’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/seth-meyers-rips-trumps-la-wildfire-claims-water-restoration-declaration-super-fing-made-up/articleshow/117131511.cms,"The Late Night host Seth Meyers hit back at Donald Trump ’s criticism of California Governor Gavin Newsom during the ongoing wildfires in Los Angeles, accusing Trump of spreading false claims.In his monologue on Thursday, Meyers addressed Trump’s claim from the previous day, in which the former president alleged that Newsom had refused to sign a so-called “water restoration declaration.” Trump falsely suggested this document would have allowed millions of gallons of water from excess rain and snow melt to be used to fight the fires.“Did you hear that? Newsom refused to sign the Water Restoration Declaration , a very real document that definitely exists, right?” Meyers joked sarcastically. The Late Night host then played an MSNBC clip exposing how the “Water Restoration Declaration” is completely made up.Meyers continued, “Of course it doesn’t exist. You can tell just from the phrase ‘Water Restoration Declaration,’ which sounds super f---ing made up.”He further debunked Trump’s claim that a lack of water access was the reason the wildfires are still burning. “Of course Trump is lying,” Meyers said. Quoting from a CNN fact check and a Washington Post article, he explained, “There’s no relationship between federal and state water management and the intensity of these fires or the ability to fight them. Some hydrants are running dry not because of a water shortage, but because high demand lowers water pressure, making it harder to move the water around.”Later, Meyers shifted focus to the community response to the fires, calling it “breathtaking and awe-inspiring.” He highlighted the importance of leaders showing compassion and solidarity during times of crisis, saying, “The kindness and compassion and resourcefulness and solidarity on display have been nothing short of breathtaking. It’s clear that people desperately want to help one another, which is why we deserve leaders and institutions who will do the same.”Meyers also stressed the urgent need to address climate change , stating, “Climate change is real. It is an imminent and existential threat to the lives and safety of Americans, and we must treat it like the crisis it is.”Furthermore, he criticised politicians for spreading lies about emergency responses. “Unfortunately, there are politicians who would rather spread lies about the emergency response . And I’m not going to name names, but Donald Trump. His name is Donald Trump.

Private Firefighters Controversy: 'Does anyone have access to private firefighters?' Millionaire sparks outrage amid LA wildfires,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/does-anyone-have-access-to-private-firefighters-millionaire-sparks-outrage-amid-la-wildfires/articleshow/117130549.cms,"Firefighters battle unprecedented challenges

As wildfires ravage Los Angeles, a wealthy real estate executive is facing backlash for attempting to secure private firefighters to protect his Pacific Palisades mansion , New York Post reports.Keith Wasserman, co-founder of Gelt Venture Partners , posted on social media platform X on Tuesday, sparking outrage with his request: “Does anyone have access to private firefighters to protect our home in Pacific Palisades? Need to act fast here. All neighbours' houses burning. Will pay any amount. Thank you.”The post, viewed over 900,000 times before being deleted, was widely criticised as tone-deaf, with many accusing Wasserman of prioritising his wealth over the collective crisis.“Incredible nerve,” wrote one user, Sam Vance. “His family is evacuated, and he’s trying to hire private firefighters to risk their lives to save a home he most certainly has insured. Incredibly tone deaf.” Another critic slammed his sense of entitlement, asking, “So you’re suggesting that potentially life-saving resources should be diverted to save your house because you’re rich while tens of thousands of people try to evacuate?”Despite the criticism, Wasserman initially responded dismissively, calling his detractors “trolls!” and joking, “Mama, I’m going viral!” He later deleted his X account entirely.The Los Angeles wildfires have already claimed at least ten lives, forced 30,000 residents to evacuate, and destroyed over 10,000 structures. Fire officials reported that water supplies in Pacific Palisades had been stretched to the limit, with hydrants running dry amid escalating demands.Janisse Quiñones, chief engineer of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, described the strain on the system: “We had a tremendous demand on our system in the Palisades. We pushed the system to the extreme.”Experts predict these wildfires could become the costliest in US history. According to JPMorgan analyst Jimmy Bhullar, economic losses could reach $50 billion, with insured losses estimated at over $20 billion. The final figure may rise further if the fires remain uncontrolled.This isn’t the first time private firefighting services for the wealthy have drawn attention. Since 2019, some Californians have turned to “on-call” private firefighting companies, a controversial trend in a state grappling with increasing fire intensity.","Keith Wasserman, co-founder of Gelt Venture Partners, posted on social media platform X: “Does anyone have access to private firefighters to protect our home in Pacific Palisades?

On ending third-party fact-checking



Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg opened up for the first time after shutting down the third-party fact-checking program and said that it felt like ""something out of like 1984"", the book, a slippery slope. Appearing on the Joe Rogan podcast , Zuckerberg blamed the Joe Biden administration for pressuring them to ""censor true information"" on his platforms.""These people from the Biden administration would call up our team and scream at them and curse and it's like these documents are all kind of there,"" Zuckerberg said. Joe Rogan sighed and asked whether he had any records of those calls. Zuckerberg said there are emails which are all published. The Meta CEO then said it reached a point where they refused to take down things from their platform which were true. ""They wanted us to take down this meme on Leonardo DiCaprio looking at a TV..."" Zuckerberg said adding that Meta refused to take down memes, and satire during the Covid. It was around that time that Biden gave a statement saying that 'these guys (Meta) are killing people' and after that, all sorts of agencies started coming after Meta, Zuckerberg said.Zuckerberg said he had been thinking about ending third-party fact-checking for quite some time. The 2020 election and the Covid changed a lot about how people trust the traditional media, Zuckerberg said acknowledging that people now get information from his platforms and other social media platforms. On the timing of his announcement which came just ahead of Donald Trump's inauguration, he said there was no good time for it but now he has a much greater hold on policies.Zuckerberg said third-party fact-checking veered from what the original intent was. ""Early on, we made it really limited; we said, ‘All right, we're just going to have a system where third-party fact-checkers handle the worst of the worst stuff.’ Things that are very clear hoaxes—like ""the Earth is flat""—not parsing speech about whether something is slightly true or slightly false; that was the original intent.""""We put the system in place, but it just veered from there; we kept trying to get it back to what we originally intended, which wasn’t about judging people’s opinions; it was meant to fact-check the most extreme claims.""Zuckerberg said people felt that fact-checkers are too biased. Going through the entire experience was like 1984, the book, a slippery slope, the Meta CEO said adding that this program was destroying so much trust, especially in the United States.","Zuckerberg said he had been thinking about ending third-party fact-checking for quite some time.

This is a worst-case scenario and is NOT happening yet.” However, sources inside the Fire department told Daily Mail that the budget cuts were already taking a toll, with vital resources stretched thin.Speaking anonymously to Daily Mail, one firefighter said: “We’re already shy 200 paramedics, and we’re on the verge of losing more because we can’t keep this up. Fire engines break down, and we can’t even get parts for them. If we shut down 16 stations, that’s about 750 personnel, and they expect us to take the same call volume.”These budget cuts come on top of $17.6 million slashes in the latest budget, which had already limited the department’s ability to prepare for emergencies. Fire chief Kristin Crowley had warned Bass last month that the $17.6 million reduction had ""severely limited the department's capacity to prepare for, train for and respond to large-scale emergencies, including wildfires."" The cuts have impacted core operations like training, fire prevention, and community education.The damage has been devastating as the wildfires continue to burn across Los Angeles. At least 4,000 homes and buildings have been destroyed, ten lives have been lost, and the Palisades Fire alone has scorched more than 54 square miles. With winds intensifying and drought conditions worsening, firefighters are struggling to contain the flames. The Palisades Fire is currently just 8 percent contained, while others, like the Eaton Fire, are completely uncontained.The timing of Bass’s recent trip to Ghana for a presidential inauguration has also come under criticism. With warnings issued about ""critical"" weather conditions days before, many have questioned her decision to leave the city during such a dire situation. When asked about her leadership at a press conference on Thursday, Bass defended her actions, saying: “I just said what I believe is the most important thing for us to do right now. That’s going to continue to be my focus.”"," memo from LAFD leadership to division chiefs and captains revealed plans to shut down as many as 16 fire stations.

ISLAMABAD: State-run Pakistan International Airlines resumed direct flights to Europe on Friday following a decision by the European Union's aviation safety agency to lift a four-year ban over safety standards, officials said.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif welcomed the resumption, saying it would help improve the airline's image.The flight from Islamabad to Paris was fully booked with more than 300 passengers, the airline said.Defense Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif inaugurated the twice-a-week flights and vowed that PIA will expand its operations to other European countries soon.Asif said in a speech that the European Union Aviation Safety Agency had imposed the ban on PIA's operations to Europe because of an ""irresponsible statement"" by a former aviation minister.The curb on PIA was imposed in 2020 after 97 people died when a PIA plane crashed in Karachi in southern Pakistan. Then-Aviation Minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan said an investigation into the crash found that nearly a third of Pakistani pilots had cheated on their pilot's exams. A government probe later concluded that the crash was caused by pilot error.The ban caused a loss of nearly $150 million a year in revenue for PIA, officials say.Also Friday, the first international flight from Gwadar, a new airport in southwestern Pakistan, departed for Muscat, government officials said.

Armed outlaws in Pakistan's Punjab province kidnapped three Hindus and issued an ultimatum, demanding the release of their accomplices from police custody.The incident took place in the Bhong area of Rahim Yar Khan district, around 400 kilometers southwest of Lahore, on Wednesday.The victims, identified as Shaman, Shameer, and Sajan, were near the Chowk Sawetra Basic Health Unit (BHU) in Bhong when five armed dacoits abducted them at gunpoint and took them to the Katcha riverine area, a region notorious for criminal activity.In a video released later by the outlaws’ ringleader Ashiq Korai, the gang threatened Ahmedpur Lama police station officer Rana Ramzan, warning that if Korai’s 10 family members were not freed, the kidnapped youths would be killed.The gang also threatened to attack the police. The video showed the abducted Hindus in chains, pleading for their release.The incident shows the ongoing lawlessness in the Katcha area, a riverine belt spanning parts of southern Punjab and Sindh provinces. Despite multiple operations, authorities have struggled to curb the power of these criminal gangs, who frequently engage in kidnappings for ransom and target minority Hindu communities to pressure authorities into compliance.Last year, the region witnessed a deadly attack on police, with 12 officers killed and seven injured when dacoits ambushed two police vehicles in the same district.","Armed outlaws in Pakistan's Punjab province kidnapped three Hindus and issued an ultimatum, demanding the release of their accomplices from police custody.

BALOCHISTAN: Two young men have reportedly been forcibly disappeared by Pakistani security forces in Balochistan's Dera Bugti district, according to a report by the Balochistan Post.The victims, identified as Ashref, the son of Bhora Khan Bugti, and Pato Khan, the son of Siraj Bugti, were allegedly detained by Frontier Corps (FC) personnel. As of now, their whereabouts remain unknown, the Balochistan Post reported.Enforced disappearances have been a persistent issue in Balochistan, with human rights groups accusing Pakistan's security forces and intelligence agencies of being complicit in the practice. Activists argue that such abductions, often without due process or legal justification, target civilians and exacerbate fear in the region.The case of Ashref and Pato Khan is part of a broader pattern of disappearances in the area. According to the Balochistan Post, in December alone, eight individuals were reported missing in Dera Bugti, underscoring the continued prevalence of this issue in the province.Families of the disappeared often face considerable difficulties in seeking justice or information about their loved ones. Despite growing international criticism, the practice remains widespread, fuelling tensions in the volatile region.Recently, Pakistan's security forces have reportedly abducted four individuals in the Kech district of Balochistan, with their families still unaware of their whereabouts, according to the Balochistan Post.The victims have been identified as Ramzan Baloch, Shagarullah, Sher Jan Ishaq, and Farooq Ishaq. Ramzan Baloch, an employee of the National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA), was taken into custody on Monday at 7 pm (local time) in the town of Mand. The fate of the abducted individuals remains unclear, and their families are left in distress, unable to obtain any information on their detention or location.The ongoing enforced disappearances in Balochistan highlight a grave human rights crisis, with victims' families facing uncertainty and fear, while the international community calls for accountability and an end to such abuses.","Two young men have reportedly been forcibly disappeared by Pakistani security forces in Balochistan's Dera Bugti district.

ISLAMABAD, Pakistan's finance minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Tuesday announced that the federal government has decided to cut the number of affiliated agencies by half, abolishing 1,50,000 jobs, as part of a sweeping cost-cutting and efficiency drive.""We are reducing the federal government's size step by step. So far, 80 departments have been consolidated into 40,"" Aurangzeb said at a press conference where he highlighted the government's goal to complete these reforms by June 2025.He added that 60% of vacant positions have been abolished, which comes to 150,000 government jobs.He said that right-sizing was part of the restructuring initiative launched in mid-2024 by a committee formed under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to rationalise expenditures and improve performance.According to the minister, the committee was to look into 43 ministries and their subordinate agencies. He said that the federal government's annual expenditure on these departments was Rs900 billion.He said that the six ministries that the government had initially selected for right-sizing included Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan, States and Frontier Regions (SAFRON), IT and Telecom, Industries and Reproduction, National Health Services and Capital Development Authority (CAD).He said that the Ministry of Kashmir Affairs, Gilgit-Baltistan and SAFRON are being merged and CAD is being abolished.According to the minister, in the second phase, out of the 60 subordinate institutions of the Ministry of Science and Technology, Commerce Division, Housing and Works, and National Food Security Research, 25 institutions will be abolished, 20 will be reduced in size and nine will be merged.""We took four ministries in the second phase and after that, we have now taken five more ministries,"" he said, adding that those selected for the third phase were ministries of federal education and professional training, information and broadcasting, power division, finance division, and national heritage and culture.He said that work had been done over the past several years to reduce the size of the federal government, but ""the problem was that if you wanted to do everything possible at once, it couldn't be done, so we decided to do it gradually, in stages.""The minister said the federal government also plans to transfer hospitals to provincial administrations. ""This is not just about cutting costs; it's about improving efficiency,"" he said.Aurangzeb also said that the plan was to shift Pakistan's economic framework towards export-driven growth, supported by digitalisation and technology initiatives and the prime minister is expected to inaugurate a new technology-related program in Karachi soon.He said that the government's focus on macroeconomic stability helped the key indicators to improve and Pakistan was standing at a promising economic juncture due to various government efforts.The size of the Pakistani government came into the crosshairs after the sharp increase in expenditures and questions were being raised over it.The current government has been taking steps and reducing the size and expenses. It abolished the traditional pension system for government employees last year and reduced the pension benefits for the current employees.","Pakistan's finance minister Muhammad Aurangzeb announced that the federal government has decided to cut the number of affiliated agencies by half. 60% of vacant positions have been abolished, which comes to 150,000 government jobs.

What is the case?

'Imran Khan broke all records'

A Pakistani court has postponed the verdict announcement in GBP 190 million Al-Qadir Trust corruption case against former Prime Minister Imran Khan. The verdict is now scheduled for January 13, according to Islamabad accountability court staff.The delay was attributed to Judge Nasir Javed Rana's leave, the court staff said. Both the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) prosecutor and the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder's lawyers have been informed about the postponement. This marks the second delay in the case. The verdict, initially reserved on December 18, was first scheduled for December 23The case alleges that Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, received land and billions of rupees from Bahria Town. In exchange, they allegedly legalized £190 million returned to Pakistan by the UK during Khan's tenure in office.In December 2023, the NAB filed a corruption reference against the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder, Bushra Bibi, and several others. The investigation focused on the alleged acquisition of hundreds of acres of land for the Al-Qadir University Trust, which reportedly caused a GBP 190 million loss to the national treasury.The charges state that Imran Khan and other accused individuals misappropriated PKR 50 billion (equivalent to GBP 190 million at the time), transferred by the UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) to the Pakistani government, ARY News reported.As part of the investigation, NAB filed a corruption reference against Imran Khan, Bushra Bibi, and six others in connection with the Al-Qadir University project, which was initially registered on December 26, 2019.Pakistan defence minister Khawaja Asif recently reiterated the corruption allegations against Khan in this case. “There has been a lot of corruption in the last 75 years, but Imran Khan broke all records,” Asif said, further alleging that Khan and his associates were heavily involved in corrupt activities.","The verdict is now scheduled for January 13, according to Islamabad accountability court staff.

Does Pakistan minister's comment on Ghazni signal foreign policy shift?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/does-pakistan-ministers-comment-on-ghazni-signal-foreign-policy-shift/articleshow/116973163.cms,"NEW DELHI: Pakistan's old antic to taunt India by naming its missiles after Afghan invaders has taken an unexpected turn in the wake of a new conflict with Afghanistan.The controversy ignited when Pakistan defence minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif described Mahmud of Ghazni - a figure celebrated in Pakistan's historical narrative - as ""merely a plunderer"". His remark, delivered during a televised interview, stunned many in a country where school textbooks have long celebrated Mahmud for his raid on the Somnath temple in India in 1026. This dispute put the spotlight on naming of missiles after figures who invaded India to rile the country.Pakistan has named its missiles after Ghazni who raided and destroyed the legendary Shiv Mandir at Somnath, after Ahmad Shah Abdali who won the third battle of Panipat after defeating the Marathas and massacring thousands of them, and after Muhammad Ghori who defeated Prithviraj Chauhan.The choices of invaders from Afghanistan were deliberately meant to not only rile India but also leave no doubt that Pakistan's ballistic missile programme was India-centric, a narrative that resonated domestically, while deflecting international scrutiny.Asif is a hardliner himself. This time, however, he seemed to target a different audience. His comment came amid escalating tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Pakistan recently conducted airstrikes in Afghanistan, claiming it targeted Pakistani Taliban operatives allegedly harboured by the Afghan Taliban. Analysts suggest Asif's critique of Mahmud was less about historical revisionism and more an attempt to antagonize the Afghan Taliban.The Afghan govt promptly denounced Asif's statements as reckless. Within Pakistan, the remarks sparked a polarizing debate. Some welcomed the re-evaluation of Mahmud's legacy, while others, including members of Asif's own political party, rebuked him. Senator Mushahid Hussain Syed, a former information minister, urged Asif to consult Romila Thapar's work on Somnath. Thapar, a respected Indian historian, posits that Mahmud's attack was motivated by economic and political factors rather than religious zeal, challenging the colonial-era framing of it as a Hindu-Muslim conflict.As the controversy lingers, it raises a provocative question: If Mahmud of Ghazni is no longer regarded as a hero, should the Ghaznavi missile be renamed? This debate transcends mere symbolism, hinting at broader shifts in Pakistan's foreign policy, historical narratives, and regional positioning, amid growing international and domestic pressures.","Defence minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif described Mahmud of Ghazni as ""merely a plunderer"" His comment came amid escalating tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan.

DHAKA: Referring to reports of India extending the visa of deposed PM Sheikh Hasina , the Bangladesh interim govt on Thursday clarified that visa-related matters become irrelevant once a passport has been cancelled. She had escaped to India in Aug last year after mass protests against her led to the fall of the Awami League govt.

He added that India is yet to respond to request for Hasina's extradition.","She had escaped to India in Aug last year after mass protests against her led to the fall of the Awami League govt. It appears she is in India on a residence permit, which is different from a visa. Earlier, the Bangladesh govt had revoked the passports of 97 people, including Hasina.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117101612,imgsize-706093,width-400,resizemode-4/117101612.jpg"

Sheikh Hasina's extradition unrelated to reported extension of her Indian visa: Bangladesh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/sheikh-hasinas-extradition-unrelated-to-reported-extension-of-her-indian-visa-bangladesh/articleshow/117092382.cms,"DHAKA: Bangladesh's interim government led by Muhammad Yunus on Thursday said deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina's reported extension of visa was unrelated to Dhaka's request for her extradition to stand trial. ""We have requested India to return Sheikh Hasina as a Bangladeshi citizen. Her status in India has no relevance to this request. It is not a matter of our consideration,"" a foreign office spokesman told journalists in a weekly media briefing.Hasina, 77, has been living in India since August 5 last year when she fled Bangladesh following a massive student-led protest that toppled her Awami League's (AL) 16-year regime.Bangladesh's International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) has issued arrest warrants for Hasina and several former Cabinet ministers, advisers, and military and civil officials for ""crimes against humanity and genocide"".The interim government on Tuesday said it has revoked the passports of Hasina and 96 others over their alleged involvement in enforced disappearances and the July killings.On Thursday, spokesman Rafiqul Alam added that Dhaka did not ""have additional information, so we will not speculate"" as he was asked for comments about the media reports that New Delhi recently extended Hasina's visa while Bangladesh revoked her diplomatic passport.But he said when a Bangladeshi citizen's passport is scrapped, the country concerned is informed through Bangladesh's missions and in such cases, a visa is no longer required.Bangladesh last month officially sought Hasina's repatriation to stand trial on charges of mass killings during the Anti-Discrimination Student's Movement dubbed as July-August uprising that toppled her Awami League government on August 5. Hasina secretly left for India the same day.Bangladesh's International Crimes Tribunal, originally formed to try the hardened collaborators of atrocities of Pakistani troops during its 1971 Liberation War, so far has issued two arrest warrants ordering authorities to arrest her and ensure her court appearance by February 12 as she was also accused of enforced disappearances during the past 16-year rule.New Delhi acknowledged the receipt of the extradition request but made no response to the letter.Asked how long India could delay responding to Bangladesh's note verbal and the diplomatic process involved, the spokesman said, ""There is no black-and-white answer to this.""""We will wait for India's response,"" he said.","Sheikh Hasina, 77, has been living in India since August 5 last year.

DHAKA: Ailing former Bangladesh PM and BNP chief Khaleda Zia on Wednesday met her son Tarique Rahman in London after more than seven years, a reunion made possible by a changed political scenario in Dhaka.Khaleda (79), who is in London for advanced treatment, had last visited the city in 2017. Since then, she had not met her son, who has been in exile in the UK since 2008, and she was not allowed to leave Bangladesh under the Sheikh Hasina-led Awami League govt. Tarique, the acting BNP chairperson, along with his wife Zubaida Rahman greeted his mother at the Heathrow airport.The ex-PM is confined to a wheelchair with rheumatoid arthritis. She also suffers from diabetes and cirrhosis of the liver. The Hasina govt had consistently refused requests for Khaleda to travel abroad for treatment after her conviction in a graft case in 2018. Khaleda left Dhaka on Tuesday aboard an air ambulance sent by the Emir of Qatar.","Khaleda Zia met her son Tarique Rahman in London after more than seven years.

Bangladesh's former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia left for London on Tuesday night for medical treatment .Zia, a political rival of ousted PM Sheikh Hasina , went abroad on a special air ambulance sent by Qatar's emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani.The 79-year-old's personal physician AZM Zahid Hossain told news agency AP that Qatar's emir arranged a special aircraft with medical facilities for the former prime minister.Enamul Haque Chowdhury, a close aide of Zia, told reporters that the air ambulance flew Zia to London, where her eldest son Tarqique Rahman has been in exile since 2007. Rahman is also the acting chairman of Zia's Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and is expected to lead the party toward the election.Zia's planned visit to London comes when Dhaka is embroiled in uncertainty, with Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus-led interim government in charge of the country since Hasina's ouster on August 5 last year.The BNP has been negotiating with the Yunus-led government for a quick election.The party initially demanded polls in three months, but later said it wanted to allow the interim government more time. However, the party is now pressing for an election sometime this year.Zia was sentenced to 17 years in jail under Hasina's rule in two corruption cases stemming from 2001-2006 when she was prime minister.In November, easing the way for Zia's political comeback, the Bangladesh high court acquitted the former prime minister severing a 7-year sentence in a corruption case.Zia was lodged in the Old Dhaka Central Jail on February 8, 2018, after a special court sentenced her to five years in prison in the Zia Orphanage Trust corruption case.On October 30, 2018, the high court raised her punishment to 10 years. However, later, she was convicted in the Zia Charitable Trust corruption case.Amid the Covid outbreak, the government temporarily released Zia from jail after 776 days through an executive order, suspending her sentence on March 25, 2020, with conditions that she would stay in her Gulshan house and not leave the country.After Sheikh Hasina was ousted from Bangladesh in the wake of a mass uprising against her government, Zia was completely freed by an order of Bangladesh President Mohammed Shahabuddin.Zia served as the prime minister of Bangladesh from March 1991 to March 1996, and again from June 2001 to October 2006.","Khaleda Zia left for London on Tuesday night for medical treatment.

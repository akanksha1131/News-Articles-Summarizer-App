Art project or UFO? Scientists torn over 'mysterious sphere' found in Colombia,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/science/art-project-or-ufo-scientists-torn-over-mysterious-sphere-found-in-colombia/articleshow/121395610.cms,"Mysterious sphere found in Colombia (Photo: X)

A strange metallic sphere has been discovered in Colombia, leaving scientists and sky-watchers divided over its origin.Some observers believe the object could be an alien spacecraft, others say it’s more likely a clever art installation.The sphere was seen flying over the town of Buga, Colombia, in March before landing, reports Fox news. The discovery was shared by Truthpolex on X.Jose Luis Velazquez , one of the researchers now studying the object, said it has “no welds or joints,” something he believes points to an extraterrestrial origin. For him, the sphere's construction is beyond known human manufacturing methods.But not everyone is convinced.Julia Mossbridge , founder and board chair of The Institute for Love and Time (TILT) and a physicist at the University of San Diego, told Fox News Digital, “It looks to me like a really cool art project,” and urged caution before jumping to conclusions.“We are entering a time when we don’t have the control that we thought we had,” she said. “It’s because we’re learning that we don’t understand what’s in our skies, what’s in our waters. And there’s something going on that’s essentially bigger than us.”Mossbridge believes that humanity’s past confidence in its technological superiority may be blinding people to the possibility of new discoveries, whether natural, artistic or even alien. “If an artist is doing this, why is that? Well, I think it’s partly the same reason,” she added.While she expressed scepticism about this particular object being from outer space, Mossbridge did not dismiss the larger phenomenon. “Frankly, we’ve been looking at UAPs ( unidentified anomalous phenomena ) for decades, and the federal government has admitted that there are things that we don’t understand, but we are investigating them.”She also highlighted the work of several groups, including the Scientific Coalition for UAP Studies , the UAP Disclosure Fund and the Galileo Project, who are independently researching strange sightings.“They are all trying to get rigorous information themselves, not necessarily waiting on the federal government,” she explained. “Because, for instance, the sphere in Colombia is in a different country. So, what are the rules about how we deal with something that’s interesting that’s found there?”Her advice? “Before you decide something’s anomalous or a UFO, bring the object to a group like the Galileo Project.” She said such teams are able to determine if the material is “clearly non-human-made.”While Mossbridge remains unconvinced about the Colombian sphere, she added it does not “discount all the other objects that are of extraterrestrial origin.”","Mysterious metallic sphere found in Buga, Colombia, in March.

Who is Cleo Carney?



What Belgian royal family say about Harvard row







Belgium's future queen Princess Elisabeth is not the only VIP foreign student caught in Donald Trump's legal battle with Harvard. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney's daughter Cleo Carney is a first-year student at Harvard. While speculations are rife about whether these VIP international students will have to take admission elsewhere if the Trump administration wins the legal battle, Canada has another issue to worry about. Canada is one of the highest contributors to Harvard's international students after China. And for undergraduate studies, the highest number of international students comes from Canada.Canada has not issued any statement after the Trump administrated barred the university from enrolling foreign students for non-compliance. The administration sought extensive records on nonimmigrant students involved in any crime, violence or illegal activities in the last five years. Harvard did not comply even after the ultimatum and went to the court to get a temporary stay on the order. If Trump wins the legal battle, the existing students will have to transfer to other universities.China, which sends the highest number of students to Harvard, said the ban will tarnish the US's image.“China has consistently opposed the politicization of educational collaboration,” a spokesperson for China’s Foreign Ministry said Friday, adding that the US move “will only tarnish its own image and reputation in the world.”The eldest daughter of Carney and economist Diana Fox Carnet, Cleao Carney, is studying social studies with a minor in energy and the environment. Cleo gained public attention in March 2025 when she introduced her father at the Liberal Party leadership event in Ottawa, where he was announced as Canada’s 24th Prime Minister. Ahead of the election, she advocated for her father as a first-time voter. ""My dad may not be the loudest candidate, but he will always be a principled one. He listens when he could perform. He believes in honesty, not spectacle. That’s what quiet leadership is: work without the ego. And that’s what my dad brings to the table. He’s not running for the spotlight. He’s running so this country can work for all of us,"" she wrote.23-year-old Princess Elisabeth has just finished her first year at Harvard, where she is doing a two-year master's degree in public policy. “The impact of [the Trump administration’s] decision will only become clearer in the coming days/weeks,” Belgian royal palace spokesperson Lore Vandoorne told Reuters. “We are currently investigating the situation.”The palace’s communications director, Xavier Baert, added, “We are analyzing this at the moment and will let things settle. A lot can still happen in the coming days and weeks.”",Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney's daughter Cleo Carney is a first-year student at Harvard.

OPT under fire: Trump's USCIS nominee seeks to end postgrad work,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/opt-under-fire-trumps-uscis-nominee-seeks-to-end-postgrad-work/articleshow/121401328.cms,"



Joseph Edlow, who is President Donald Trump's nominee for the post of the director at US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), in a recent nomination hearing said he wants to end post-graduation optional practical training (OPT) that is available to international students.A one-year OPT is available to international students, which is extended by another two years for students from the STEM field. International students undertaking an academic course hold an F-1 visa.During a recent hearing before a Senate Judiciary Committee, when asked about the changes he would make to the OPT programme if he headed USCIS, Edlow said, ""I think the way in which OPT has been handled over the past four years, with the help of certain decisions coming out of the DC Circuit Court, have been a real problem in terms of misapplication of the law.""TOI had tracked and reported the legal challenges that this programme had faced. The Washington Alliance of Technology Workers (WashTech) had first challenged the OPT programme in 2014. After a long-drawn battle, the US Court of Appeals (DC Circuit) in Oct 2022 upheld the validity of the OPT programme and the two-year extension for STEM-OPT. While WashTech sought a review from the US Supreme Court, this was declined.In other words, the programme continued to be valid.During the hearing, Edlow added that he is in favour of removing the ability for employment authorisations for F-1 students beyond the time they are in school.According to immigration attorneys' based on his statement it would appear the intent is only to have a one-year OPT (pre-completion OPT) concurrent with studies. This statement has sent alarm bells ringing among the international student community, including those who are aspiring to study in the US. International students are already under stress owing to abrupt revocations of their SEVIS status and/or F-I visas, even as district courts are ordering temporary restraining orders in their favour.A bill to eliminate OPT was also introduced in the House, but is expected to fall-flat as the numbers do not add up in the Senate for it to sail through.The Indian student community in the US is significant in terms of numbers. According to the Open Doors Report (academic year 2022-23), there were 2.7 lakh Indian students in the US, with 69,000 Indian students participating in OPT programmes.Responding to this development, Miriam Feldblum, president and CEO of the Presidents' Alliance (a coalition of over 570 campus leaders), stated, ""Aiming to end post-graduation OPT will undermine the US overall ability to recruit and retain top talent from around the world. Experiential learning is and has long been a crucial component of education in this country. This includes post-graduation OPT opportunities. """"Today, over 2.4 lakh international students participate in OPT, many in STEM fields. OPT enhances the educational experiences of international students while bolstering the workforce in communities across the US, supporting employers, and contributing to our economic competitiveness. We encourage the department of homeland security to prioritise policies that expand America's global and domestic talent pipeline to spur innovation, boost our economy, and secure our nation's future as a global education and research leader,"" she added.","Joseph Edlow, President Donald Trump's nominee for the post of the director at US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), said he wants to end post- graduation optional practical training (OPT) A one-year OPT is available to international students, which is extended by another two years for students from the STEM field.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121401338,imgsize-6848,width-400,resizemode-4/121401338.jpg"

Strauss' ""Blue Danube"" is heading into space this month to mark the 200th anniversary of the waltz king's birth. The classical piece will be beamed into the cosmos as it's performed by the Vienna Symphony Orchestra. The celestial send-off on May 31 - livestreamed with free public screenings in Vienna, Madrid and New York - also will celebrate the European Space Agency's founding 50 years ago. Although the music could be converted into radio signals in real time, according to officials, ESA will relay a pre-recorded version from the orchestra's rehearsal the day before to avoid any technical issues. The live performance will provide the accompaniment.The radio signals will hurtle away at the speed of light, or a mind-blowing 670 million mph (more than 1 billion kph). That will put the music past the moon in 1 ½ seconds, past Mars in 4 ½ minutes, past Jupiter in 37 minutes and past Neptune in four hours. Within 23 hours, the signals will be as far from Earth as Nasa's Voyager 1, the world's most distant spacecraft at more than 24 billion km in interstellar space.A second major power outage hit southeastern France early Sunday, this time in the city of Nice, after a suspected arson damaged an electrical facility.Police currently have not established a link between the blackout that affected parts of Nice as well as nearby cities of Cagnes-sur-Mer and Saint-Laurent-du-Var, and a power outage on Saturday that disrupted the city of Cannes during the closing day of its renown film festival.

On the fifth anniversary of George Floyd’s death, US Congresswoman Ilhan Omar said his murder should never be forgotten and neither should the urgent need to reform America’s criminal justice system.In a series of posts on social media, Omar, who represents Minnesota’s 5th congressional district, said, “It’s been five years since George Floyd’s murder. He should be alive today. No amount of grandstanding or rewriting history will change that fact.” She added, “On this day—and every day—we must commit ourselves to the pursuit of justice. That must include dismantling systemic racism and radically transforming our approach to criminal justice. ”George Floyd was a 46-year-old Black man and was killed in Minneapolis in 2020 when white police officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for more than nine minutes. The killing, captured on a bystander’s phone, sparked worldwide protests against racial injustice and police brutality. Chauvin was later convicted of murder and sentenced to 22 years in prison.Omar’s message came as people across the country marked five years since George Floyd’s death. In Houston , where Floyd grew up, his family gathered near his gravesite.In Minneapolis, where he was killed, locals held a church service, a candlelight vigil, and a gospel concert at George Floyd Square, the street corner now named after him.In another post, Omar reflected on the wider impact of Floyd’s death. “His murder ignited urgent conversations about the state of our nation, the state of policing, and the state of our justice system — as well as who is entitled to justice,” she wrote. “And unfortunately, as we have seen every time there is a movement for the liberation of Black people, for equality, for justice, we see a backslide — a backlash — where things not only stop progressing, but where people are emboldened to express their racism publicly. ”That backlash, she suggested, could be seen in recent efforts to undo police reforms and diversity programmes introduced in the wake of Floyd’s killing. In Minneapolis, reforms introduced after a federal investigation into police misconduct are under threat, as US President Donald Trump ’s administration has questioned their legitimacy, calling the data used “flawed” and the agreements “handcuffing” local police. However, Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey insisted the city would fully comply with the new consent decree.Nationally, Trump has rolled back Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) policies across federal agencies and the military. In Washington DC, the Black Lives Matter Plaza has been removed. In Houston, a famous mural of Floyd was recently demolished as part of a building teardown.Omar also condemned those calling for Chauvin to be pardoned. “We are seeing unjust calls for Chauvin to be pardoned,” she wrote. “Regardless of any federal pardon, he still faces the state murder conviction and will remain in jail. He will always be known to the people of this country and the world as a murderer.”Her posts come as surveys show a drop in public belief that Floyd’s death led to lasting change. According to a recent Pew Research Center poll, 72% of Americans say little or no improvement has been made in the lives of Black people. Support for the Black Lives Matter movement has also declined by 15% since its peak in 2020.Floyd’s family and supporters have continued to honour his memory and push for lasting reform. “We still have a lot of work before we see true justice and liberation,” Omar said. “But today I’m thinking of George Floyd’s family as they continue to grieve his loss. May he forever rest in power.”",US Congresswoman Ilhan Omar said his murder should never be forgotten and neither should the urgent need to reform America’s criminal justice system.

Former Obama speechwriter and “Pod Save America” host Jon Lovett has admitted that he held back concerns about Joe Biden ’s health during the 2024 campaign because he wanted Biden to win re-election.Speaking on Jon Stewart’s “The Weekly Show” podcast, Lovett said he was worried about the president’s physical and cognitive state but chose not to talk about it publicly. “I remember feeling I want to talk about this as a huge liability. To talk about this is something Joe Biden can overcome, but I’m not going to go so far as to say, ‘I think Joe Biden must drop out. He is too old to be president,’” Lovett said.He added, “A, because I didn’t know exactly what was going on behind the scenes, but B, if Joe Biden is the candidate, I want him to f—king win.”Lovett admitted he feared that any criticism from the left would be used by Biden’s political enemies. “It was about being honest about Joe Biden’s age as a liability while knowing that if he is the nominee, I want to be clear that I thought it was important to make sure we did everything we could to reelect him,” he said.He explained his reluctance further: “Having the words we’re saying taken out of context and all of a sudden be part of the case against Joe Biden from the right — that would use any person criticising Joe Biden from the left as a weapon against him.”The issue of Biden’s health has been drawing more attention, especially following the release of the book Original Sin by CNN’s Jake Tapper and Axios’s Alex Thompson. The book claims the White House deliberately tried to downplay concerns about Biden’s decline.Lovett himself features in Original Sin, in an anecdote describing a meeting with Biden on April 26, 2024, alongside co-hosts Jon Favreau and Dan Pfeiffer. According to the book, the trio were left “deeply disturbed” after the meeting, reportedly finding Biden “rambling” and “incoherent.”US President Donald Trump has also criticised Biden's physical and mental decline. Last week, Biden, who is 82 years old, was diagnosed with prostate cancer.

After a long-drawn battle, the US Court of Appeals (DC Circuit) in October 2022 upheld the validity of the OPT program and the two-year extension for STEM-OPT. While WashTech sought a review from the US Supreme Court, this was declined.In other words, the program continued to be valid.During the hearing, Edlow added that he is in favour of removing the ability for employment authorisations for F-1 students beyond the time they are in school.According to immigration attorneys’ based on his statement it would appear the intent is only to have a one-year OPT (pre completion OPT) concurrent with studies.This statement has sent alarm bells ringing among the international student community, including those who are aspiring to study in the US. International students are already under stress owing to abrupt revocations of their SEVIS status and/or F-I visas, even as district courts are ordering temporary restraining orders in their favour.A bill to eliminate OPT was also introduced in the House, but is expected to fall-flat as the numbers do not add up in the Senate for it to sail through.The Indian student community in the US is significant in terms of numbers. According to the Open Doors Report (academic year 2022-23), there were 2.70 lakh Indian students in the US, with 69,000 Indian students participating in OPT programs.Responding to this development, Miriam Feldblum, President and CEO of the Presidents’ Alliance (a coalition of over 570 campus leaders), stated, “Aiming to end post-graduation OPT will undermine the US overall ability to recruit and retain top talent from around the world. Experiential learning is and has long been a crucial component of education in this country. This includes post-graduation OPT opportunities. ”“Today, over 2.40 lakh international students participate in OPT, many in STEM fields. OPT enhances the educational experiences of international students while bolstering the workforce in communities across the US, supporting employers, and contributing to our economic competitiveness. We encourage the Department of Homeland Security to prioritize policies that expand America’s global and domestic talent pipeline to spur innovation, boost our economy, and secure our nation’s future as a global education and research leader,” she added.","Joseph Edlow, President Trump’s nominee for the post of the director at US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) in a recent nomination hearing has said he wants to end post-graduation optional practical training (OPT) A one year OPT is available to international students, which is extended by two years from students from the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) field.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121395222,imgsize-748427,width-400,resizemode-4/121395222.jpg"

Poll Do you believe that climate change is contributing to extreme weather events in Pakistan? Yes No





At least 14 people were killed and more than 100 injured after powerful windstorms swept across central and northern Pakistan following a days-long heatwave, officials confirmed on Sunday.The storms, described as “particularly destructive” by authorities, battered the provinces of Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa as well as Islamabad on Saturday afternoon and evening.Mazhar Hussain, spokesperson for the Punjab disaster management authority, was quoted by news agency AFP as saying, “This windstorm was particularly destructive. The wind speed was very high. There was so much dust in it that visibility was greatly reduced.”According to him, the extreme weather followed several days of intense heat, with temperatures exceeding 45°C. “There were three to four days in the recent heatwave where temperatures went up quite a lot,” he added, attributing the sudden storm to the intense build-up of heat.The majority of casualties were caused by collapsing roofs and walls, while at least two people died after being struck by solar panels dislodged by high-speed winds.In one tragic incident, lightning claimed the life of one man and injured three others.The storms uprooted trees, knocked over electric poles, and caused significant damage to vehicles and infrastructure. Social media was flooded with dramatic videos showing the aftermath, including a viral clip filmed inside a passenger plane struggling to land in Lahore before being diverted to Karachi amid severe turbulence.Islamabad and surrounding areas have also seen multiple unusual hailstorms over April and May, damaging vehicles and solar panels—marking a growing trend of erratic and extreme weather events in the country.Pakistan is widely recognised as one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change, with early summers and intense heatwaves becoming increasingly common.India is also battling extreme temperatures. According to news agency ANI, Rajasthan's Jaisalmer hit 48°C, forcing locals indoors. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) warned that severe heatwave conditions will continue in Rajasthan until May 27 and in Punjab, Haryana, and Jammu and Kashmir until May 26.Meanwhile, heavy monsoon rainfall has already arrived on India’s west coast, with IMD forecasting intense downpours over Kerala, Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Goa in the coming week.Back in Pakistan, the Meteorological Department has predicted more storms on Sunday, raising concerns about further damage and casualties.","Powerful windstorms swept across central and northern Pakistan following a days- long heatwave.

Abdul Latif Baloch, a well-known journalist in Pakistan's Balochistan province, was shot dead inside his home in Mashkay, in the wee hours of Saturday.The Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC), a local rights group, confirmed that he was shot by state-backed armed groups at around 3 am, in front of his wife and children, reported news agency ANI.Latif was respected for his fearless coverage of human rights abuses and military operations in Balochistan. His work focused on enforced disappearances, extrajudicial killings, and the struggle of ordinary Baloch citizens. His death underlines the extreme risk faced by reporters in Pakistan.This incident comes just months after his son, Saif Baloch, and seven other family members were reportedly abducted by security forces and later found dead. Activists describe these patterns of violence as part of Pakistan’s “kill and dump” policy, used to silence dissent and suppress the Baloch identity.Shalee Baloch of the Baloch Women Forum described the killing as part of “systemic violence” against the Baloch people. She urged international organisations and media to intervene, saying silence from the global community is enabling further bloodshed.Human rights groups and press freedom organisations have condemned the assassination and are calling for urgent international pressure on Pakistan with regard to Balochistan.

Jailed former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan has ruled out any negotiations with Pakistan's civilian government, declaring that only talks with the country’s military establishment are meaningful.In a post on X, Khan said, “Engaging in any talks with the puppet Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) government is pointless. This illegitimate Form-47 installed government has already wasted two months. Its only objective is to cling to false authority. It holds no real power.”Khan, who has been behind bars since August 2023 in multiple cases following the collapse of his government in April 2022, stressed that negotiations would only be held with those who actually “hold power”, the military establishment, and only in the national interest.“I do not fear hardship as my resolve remains strong,” he said, while alleging that political cases, abductions, and forced press conferences were being used to dismantle his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party. “All prove that the rule of law has been entirely dismantled. What we now have is the law of the jungle,” he added.Reiterating his stance from earlier this week, Khan stated that May 9, 2023, the day of violent protests after his arrest, was a “false flag operation” designed to crush PTI.“No CCTV footage has been presented to this day... The truth will be evident to all if the CCTV footage of that day is made public,” he added, as reported by news agency PTI.In a separate post, Khan also dismissed media reports suggesting that a deal was in the works with the military. “No one has approached me for any negotiations. News claiming otherwise is entirely false,” he said, adding that despite harsh jail conditions, including denial of access to his children and physician, he remains steadfast.He recently took a swipe at Army chief General Asim Munir’s promotion to Field Marshal, saying “it might have been more fitting to give him the title of ‘King’ instead, because right now, the country is ruled by the law of the jungle. And in the jungle, there is only one king,” as per PTI.Meanwhile, the Punjab government said Khan has refused to undergo polygraph and voice analysis tests in 12 terrorism cases linked to the May 9 riots for the third consecutive time.Pakistani Punjab’s information minister Azma Bokhari accused Khan of defying court orders, saying he made repeated excuses to avoid the tests. “He must understand this is Adiala Jail, not his Bani Gala residence,” she said.The trial in the GHQ attack case, which was last heard in February, has been adjourned again until May 29. Separately, the hearing in the Toshakhana-II case was postponed to May 26.Khan’s party has also urged the Islamabad High Court to speed up hearings in the Al-Qadir Trust case involving Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi. Protests continue outside the court, with party members demanding Khan’s release and denouncing what they call “unjust incarceration.”",Former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan has ruled out any negotiations with Pakistan's civilian government.

Sindhudesh as an independent nation: JSMM demands UN recognition,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/sindhudesh-as-an-independent-nation-jsmm-demands-un-recognition/articleshow/121359382.cms,".

The Sindhudesh Global Freedom Charter





The Jeay Sindh Muttahida Mahaz (JSMM), a Sindhi nationalist group led by exiled chairman Shafi Burfat, has issued a renewed plea to the United Nations and other international communities, urging recognition of Sindhudesh as an independent nation and calling attention to what it describes as sustained political repression and human rights violations in Pakistan ’s Sindh province.In a comprehensive political manifesto titled, JSMM has approached the United Nations, international human rights bodies, democratic governments, and global civil society organizations, arguing that the Sindhi people are subject to a form of internal colonialism under Pakistan’s military and political establishment.In a direct appeal to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Indian public, JSMM cited historical and cultural ties between Sindh and India, requesting moral and political solidarity. The group also called on international institutions to send human rights observers, document alleged violations, and engage with Sindh’s demand for peaceful self-determination.JSMM alleges that demographic engineering through state-sponsored resettlement has diluted Sindh’s ethnic composition, threatening the linguistic and cultural identity of the Sindhi people. Environmental degradation, particularly the diversion of the Indus river’s waters, has compounded local grievances, with widespread desertification of once-fertile lands cited as an ecological consequence of state policy.The statement firmly condemned Pakistan's security forces for committing serious human rights abuses in Sindh, including enforced disappearances, torture, and extrajudicial killings of political activists, journalists, and student leaders. It mentioned that anti-terrorism legislation is being misused to target secular and nationalist movements, whereas religious extremists receive support from the state.Positioning itself as a secular, democratic movement, JSMM has reiterated its vision for a sovereign Republic of Sindhudesh, grounded in principles of equality, minority protections, and social justice. The group invokes international law including the United Nations Charter and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) to support Sindh’s right to self-determination.Long before modern borders were drawn, Sindh flourished as the heart of the ancient Indus Valley Civilisation which was a sophisticated urban society that emerged over 5,000 years ago along the banks of the Indus river. With advanced city planning, intricate craftsmanship, and a vibrant mercantile culture, Sindh was once a beacon of early human progress. Mohenjo-daro, one of the civilisation’s most iconic sites, still stands as a testament to the region’s intellectual and architectural legacy. This deep-rooted historical identity is central to the Sindhi nationalist narrative, which views contemporary political struggles as a continuation of a civilisational arc interrupted by colonial conquests and post partition state formation.I n the colonial era, Sindh existed as a distinct administrative region under British India before being annexed, and eventually was re-established as a separate province in 1936. Advocates for Sindhi autonomy argue that this period fostered a unique political consciousness, one that emphasised cultural plurality and regional pride. The Partition of 1947, however, redrew not just boundaries but identities. Over subsequent decades, Sindhi activists have pointed to a pattern of political marginalisation and centralised control, arguing that their historical autonomy has been systematically pulled apart.Framing Sindh’s struggle as both civilizational and contemporary, the charter situated the region within the historical legacy of the Indus valley civilization, asserting that Sindh was forced into joining Pakistan in 1947 and has since faced cultural erasure and economic exploitation. The document claims that Sindh's resources including oil, gas, coal, fertile farmland, and deep-sea ports have been systematically extracted to benefit other regions, while the local population remains economically marginalized.While JSMM’s claims are politically charged and remain unacknowledged by the Pakistani state, the charter marks a significant step in internationalizing what has largely been a domestic conflict.","The Jeay Sindh Muttahida Mahaz (JSMM), a Sindhi nationalist group led by exiled chairman Shafi Burfat, has issued a renewed plea to the United Nations and other international communities.

A promotion after defeat: What's behind Asim Munir's Field Marshal gambit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/field-marshal-asim-munir-pakistan-army-chief-operation-sindoor-india-and-pakistan/articleshow/121319156.cms,"Asim Munir’s grip on power may look firm, but it’s anything but secure.

Promotion or protection?

Officially, the move is being framed as a recognition of ""strategic brilliance."" PM Sharif praised Munir’s ""decisive defeat of the enemy,"" asserting that under his leadership, the military ""staunchly defended Pakistan’s sovereignty."" Munir himself called the promotion ""an honour for the armed forces and the nation.""

But few outside Pakistan’s tightly controlled media landscape are buying it.

""Field Marshal rank is usually conferred after a military victory,"" Tilak Devasher, a seasoned Pakistan watcher, told the Economic Times. ""This may be the first time it has been awarded after a defeat-it seems intended to mask that defeat.""

The timing is hard to ignore. Pakistan’s public is still reeling from the fallout of the India strikes, and internal dissent within the army is reportedly rising.

A widely circulated letter from a group calling itself ""The Guardians of Honour"" accused Munir of corruption and military incompetence. The letter reflects what some analysts say is quiet but growing discontent within senior ranks.

A shield against scrutiny

All ceremony, no strategy

The big picture: The war at home

Munir’s rise comes at a fragile moment for Pakistan. The ceasefire with India has held for now. But underneath the diplomatic calm lies a volatile domestic landscape:

Security turmoil: Over 3,700 terror incidents have claimed nearly 3,900 lives in the past 17 months, according to ISPR figures-pointing to a deteriorating internal security climate, especially in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

With rising inflation, IMF-dependency, and India's suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty, Pakistan's economy teeters on the edge. The military’s growing political role is being scrutinized for exacerbating the instability. Observers note that Munir is not merely defending national borders-he is navigating a labyrinth of domestic vulnerabilities that could unravel his authority.

His use of the two-nation theory and religious rhetoric to frame the India conflict was seen by critics as an attempt to rally the nation behind him. But the strategy may have backfired. ""Instead of unifying the nation, the gambit drew attention to Pakistan’s widening fractures,"" write analysts Ashok Behuria and Uttam Sinha in a joint commentary in the TOI.

The ghost of Imran Khan

What’s next

Munir’s elevation to Field Marshal is not about military strategy-it’s about political survival. It’s about shoring up a fractured command structure, muffling dissent, and projecting strength in the face of growing weakness.

Though the promotion may temporarily strengthen Munir’s position, it doesn’t erase the challenges ahead:

Internal threats persist, from Baloch separatists to the resurgent Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan.

PTI's political comeback looms, with Khan’s moral leverage growing even from prison.

Civil-military tension could intensify, especially if the rank is seen as an attempt to silence dissent or circumvent institutional checks.

There’s also talk of Munir eventually transitioning into a political role-possibly even as president. Ayub Khan set the precedent. In Pakistan’s fragile democracy, few would be surprised if history rhymed again.





In a move steeped more in symbolism than substance, Pakistan’s powerful army chief General Asim Munir has been elevated to the rarefied rank of Field Marshal . The announcement, made on Tuesday by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s cabinet, marks the first such promotion in over six decades. Only one other man-military dictator Ayub Khan in 1959-has held the title.But unlike Ayub, who awarded himself the rank amid consolidating his political power, Munir’s elevation comes on the heels of a military debacle. A bruising exchange with India, following a deadly attack in Pahalgam, resulted in India striking at least nine Pakistani air bases. The damage, while officially downplayed in Pakistan, left Munir politically exposed.So why the promotion? And why now?In a country where generals often enjoy impunity, the Field Marshal title may serve more as legal and political armor than as a mark of distinction. Some analysts see the promotion as a pre-emptive move to insulate Munir from possible court martial or early retirement, the ET report said.Legal experts point out that the Pakistani constitution makes no mention of the rank.Nor does the Pakistan Army Act. Instead, the promotion was reportedly made under Rule 199A of the Army Regulations (1998), which states that a general may be promoted to Field Marshal ""without regard to seniority or any specific appointment.""In essence, the move raises Munir above the military’s existing command structure-and, potentially, above accountability.Though technically ceremonial, the rank carries potent political meaning. In Pakistan’s civil-military power dynamic, optics often matter more than operational command.""Munir is now very much in the driving seat as the pivot of the power structure,"" said Senator Mushahid Hussain Syed, former chair of the Senate defense committee. ""Given the weakness and divisions amongst the civilian politicians... all the mainstream political forces were convinced that the road to Islamabad lies through Rawalpindi.""That reality is reflected in the government’s simultaneous decision to extend the term of air chief marshal Zaheer Ahmed Babar Sidhu-his second extension. Sidhu was credited with executing Operation Bunyanun Marsoos, Pakistan’s retaliatory air campaign against India's Operation Sindoor Still, in a tightly managed information environment, the military’s version of events prevails. State media declared a historic victory. Social media was flooded with hashtags like #PakistanStandsUnited. Meanwhile, dissenting voices-journalists, analysts, even former officers-vanished from screens.Munir’s political calculus also includes a rising challenge from behind bars: Former Prime Minister Imran Khan. His PTI party has labeled Munir a ""warmonger and coward,"" accusing him of dragging Pakistan into war to consolidate power. Khan’s moral authority, paradoxically strengthened by his imprisonment, continues to mobilize his base.Sharif’s civilian government, already seen as beholden to the military, risks further erosion of legitimacy. As one viral meme put it: ""War fought by Airforce. Army Chief promoted. Army’s only contribution-taking videos of tanks and hiding in bunkers.""(With inputs from agencies)","Pakistan's powerful army chief Asim Munir has been elevated to the rank of Field Marshal.

Pakistan Supreme Court upholds death penalty in beheading case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-supreme-court-upholds-death-penalty-in-beheading-case/articleshow/121300483.cms,"



ISLAMABAD: In a landmark judgment, the Supreme Court of Pakistan on Tuesday upheld the death sentence of Zahir Jaffer , convicted of the gruesome 2021 murder of Noor Mukadam, the 27-year-old daughter of a former Pakistani diplomat.The decision, delivered by a three-member bench led by Justice Hashim Kakar, reaffirmed the judiciary’s stance on a case that has gripped the nation and exposed deep-seated issues of gender violence and privilege in Pakistan’s elite circles. The ruling, however, also raises questions about the consistency of justice in a country where systemic inequalities often shield the powerful.The case, one of the most high-profile in Pakistan’s recent history, stems from the horrific events of July 20, 2021, when Noor Mukadam was found tortured and beheaded at Jaffer’s residence in Islamabad’s upscale Sector F-7/4.Jaffer, a Pakistani-American and son of a wealthy industrialist, was arrested at the scene, covered in blood. Investigations revealed that Mukadam, a childhood acquaintance, was held hostage for two days, tortured with a knuckleduster, raped, and ultimately decapitated after allegedly rejecting Jaffer’s marriage proposal. The brutality of the crime, coupled with the elite status of both the victim and the perpetrator, sparked nationwide outrage and reignited debates over violence against women in Pakistan.The apex court’s verdict dismissed Jaffer’s appeal, which claimed “erroneous appreciation” of evidence and questioned the fairness of the trial due to media influence. The court upheld the death penalty for murder but converted Jaffer’s second death sentence for rape to life imprisonment, citing legal considerations.“This is not just my daughter’s case; it is a case for all the daughters of Pakistan,” said Shaukat Mukadam, Noor’s father. The ruling has been hailed by many as a victory for accountability, with social media posts on X reflecting public relief: “I hope Noor’s parents will sleep a little better tonight,” wrote one user, while another called it a “win for humanity.” Yet, the decision also exposes uncomfortable truths about Pakistan’s legal and social landscape.Critics argue that the case’s prominence owes much to the victim’s elite background, highlighting a stark disparity in how justice is pursued. “Mukadam’s status as a diplomat’s daughter shone a spotlight on her murder,” said women’s rights activist Tahira Abdullah, noting that countless similar cases involving less privileged women rarely garner such attention or swift judicial action. Pakistan ranks 153 out of 156 countries in the World Economic Forum’s 2021 gender gap index, and domestic violence remains a pervasive issue, with 28% of women aged 15-49 reporting physical violence, according to the ministry of human rights.","The Supreme Court of Pakistan upheld the death sentence of Zahir Jaffer.

ISLAMABAD: The Shehbaz Sharif govt in Pakistan promoted Tuesday army chief Syed Asim Munir from general to the five-star rank of Field Marshal in recognition of what it described as “exemplary leadership” while responding to India’s Operation Sindoor and bringing “great honour to our motherland”.For a country that has had four military rulers at different periods in its history, Field Marshal Munir is only the second Army chief to have been elevated to the apex rank, modelled on the British army’s structure. The first one, Field Marshal Ayub Khan, assumed the rank in 1959 while he was President, citing “requests” from Pakistani civil society.PM Shehbaz’s office announced that the cabinet unanimously decided to also continue the services of Air Chief Marshal Zahar Ahmed Babar Sidhu after his term ends.The statement also claimed that Pakistan downed five Indian jets and thwarted “further incursions”, leading to a US-mediated pause in military operations from May 10. Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the army’s media affairs wing, quoted Field Marshal Munir as dedicating the honour to “the nation, armed forces, and martyrs”.In a congratulatory statement on X, Shehbaz credited Field Marshal Munir with orchestrating a “high strategy” during the conflict with India, which escalated with the latter’s May 6-7 airstrikes targeting nine terrorist sites.Operation Sindoor was India’s response to 26 deaths in the April 22 terrorist attack on tourists in J&K’s Pahalgam.Without naming India, Shehbaz said that under Field Marshal Munir, the army “crushed the enemy’s nefarious designs”.With Pakistan’s history of military coups looming large, newly coronated Field Marshal Munir is widely seen as the kingmaker behind Shehbaz’s premiership. Critics of the move within Pakistan argue the promotion strengthens the military’s grip over civilian governance, especially amid domestic challenges like the Baloch insurgency and economic woes.The timing of the promotion, coinciding with Pakistan seeking US and EU’s support to counter “India’s terrorism narrative”, suggests a bid to project strength.While the PM's office and ISPR frame Field Marshal Munir’s elevation as a tribute to national resilience, its political undertones and opaque military claims raise concerns about democratic backsliding and regional instability.","Shehbaz Sharif govt in Pakistan promoted Tuesday army chief Syed Asim Munir from general to the five-star rank of Field Marshal. Field Marshal Munir is only the second Army chief to have been elevated to the apex rank, modelled on the British army's structure.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121300326,imgsize-12008,width-400,resizemode-4/121300326.jpg"

DHAKA: The Bangladesh interim govt has said necessary steps will be taken together with the people if under ""instigation of defeated forces or as part of a foreign conspiracy"", the govt's performance of responsibilities becomes impossible.This came amid a growing rift between Bangladesh chief adviser Muhammad Yunus and the military leadership over a controversial proposal to facilitate a ""humanitarian corridor"" to Myanmar and days after the govt refuted a key ally's claim that Yunus had mulled resignation. ""The interim govt will take necessary decisions together with the people of the country if the govt's autonomy, reform efforts, justice process, fair election plan, and normal operations are obstructed to the point of making its duties unmanageable,"" the council of advisers said in a statement after an unscheduled meeting on Saturday.It said that if ""under the instigation of defeated forces or as part of a foreign conspiracy, the performance of these responsibilities becomes impossible, the govt will present all reasons to the public and then take the necessary steps with the people"".During a series of meetings on Saturday and Sunday, Yunus also rejected demands by major national parties, including BNP, to hold the national election by Dec this year, reiterating that the poll will be held in 2026 but not after June.""Muhammad Yunus is a man of his word. He gave a cut-off time. He won't go beyond that,"" chief adviser's press secretary Shafiqul Alam told reporters referring to the election likely to be held between Dec 2025 and June next year.Leaders of BNP, Jamaat-e-Islami, National Citizen Party and other political parties, except Awami League, held separate meetings with Yunus. NCP members said local govt polls should be held ahead of the national election - a demand being seen as the party's bid to have a chance at making its position stronger at the grassroots-level before the Bangladesh poll.","Bangladesh interim govt says necessary steps will be taken together with the people if under ""instigation of defeated forces or as part of a foreign conspiracy"" This came amid a growing rift between Bangladesh chief adviser Muhammad Yunus and the military leadership.

DHAKA: Bangladesh security forces surrounded the national tax authority headquarters on Sunday as its employees extended a two-week-long strike over the interim government's reforms, reportedly leaving millions of dollars in taxes uncollected.Government orders to overhaul the powerful tax authority, the National Board of Revenue (NBR), have sparked fury from ordinary employees to top management.""Tax, customs, and VAT -- all three wings will observe a complete work abstention from Monday,"" Joint Tax Commissioner Monalisa Saha Sushmita told reporters at the main NBR building in Dhaka, where police and armed security gathered.Bangladesh has been in turmoil since a student-led revolt ousted former prime minister Sheikh Hasina in August 2024, ending her 15-year iron-fisted rule.The interim government -- led by Nobel Peace Prize microfinance pioneer Muhammad Yunus -- is trying to instil sweeping government reforms.The tax board protest reflects the divisions, rival loyalties and confusion between government branches and the caretaker administration.The government order issued on May 12 proposed splitting the powerful money-raising NRB into two.Crucially, it would also hand control of the new sections to government-chosen civil servants from outside the NRB.Sushmita claimed that the strike will mean, in effect, that ""imports and exports will also be halted"" and that tax revenues totalling between $122-163 million per day had not been collected since the strike began.It was not possible to verify those figures.Bangladesh is the world's second-largest garment manufacturer, while textile and garment production accounts for about 80 percent of the country's exports.The industry has been rebuilding after it was hit hard by last year's unrest.In separate protests on Sunday, hundreds of civil servants demonstrated in Dhaka against a government order giving it greater power to sack employees for disciplinary breaches.""If the government proceeds with the amended ordinance, the interim government will face severe criticism,"" said Mohammad Nazrul Islam from the Inter-Ministerial Employees Association.",Government orders to overhaul the powerful tax authority have sparked fury from ordinary employees to top management.

DHAKA: Bangladesh began the first trial on Sunday at a special court prosecuting former senior figures connected to the ousted government of Sheikh Hasina, the chief prosecutor said.The court in the capital Dhaka accepted a formal charge against eight police officials in connection to the killing of six protesters on August 5 last year, the day Hasina fled the country as the protesters stormed her palace.The eight men are charged with crimes against humanity. Four are in custody and four are being tried in absentia.""The formal trial has begun,"" Tajul Islam, chief prosecutor of Bangladesh's domestic International Crimes Tribunal (ICT), told reporters.""The prosecution believes that this prosecution will be able to prove the crimes done by the accused,"" he said.It is the first formal charge in any case related to the killings during last year's student-led uprising, which ended Hasina's iron-fisted rule of 15 years.Up to 1,400 people were killed between July and August 2024 when Hasina's government launched a brutal campaign to silence the protesters, according to the United Nations.The list of those facing trial includes Dhaka's former police commissioner, Habibur Rahman, who is among those being tried in absentia.Hasina also fled by helicopter to India, her old ally.She remains in self-imposed exile, defying Dhaka's extradition request to face charges of crimes against humanity.The launch of the trials of senior figures from Hasina's government is a key demand of several of the political parties now jostling for power as the South Asian nation awaits elections that the interim government has vowed will take place before June 2026.Islam said the eight men were accused of ""different responsibilities"", including the most senior for ""superior command responsibility, some for direct orders..

Rare earth elements crucial industrial inputs?



A call for responsible mining:



Will KIO enforce more responsible mining?





Lahtaw Kai draws an imaginary mountain into the air with her hands and uses her fingers to dot it with holes.""At the top of the mountains, they drill holes and then pour chemicals like ammonium nitrate into the ground to extract the rare earth minerals at the bottom,"" the Myanmar environment activist told DW.Lahtaw Kai — whose name we've changed for security reasons — was illustrating the so-called in-situ leaching technique, which has been applied for decades in mining rare earths in Myanmar's northern Kachin state.The process begins at the top of the mountains, where chemicals are injected into the earth through a network of pipes. As the solution tracks downslope, it gathers rare earth elements, which are then collected in large ponds.At hundreds of mining sites in the region, in-situ leaching is proving to be a huge risk to both the environment and local villagers.""The rare earth sludge dries out in wood-fired kilns, and areas close to the mining sites constantly smell bad,"" said Lahtaw Kai, adding that she and her research team cannot stay there for more than 30 minutes because it's hard to breathe.""But people are working there without gloves and masks.Companies don't provide protection. So, the workers get sick and then [the company] fires them and brings in new workers,"" she added.Seng Li, a human rights activist currently based in Chiang Mai, Thailand, has researched mining sites in Myanmar's north and says the mountains used to be green before mining started.""Now those mountains are very ugly, the river turned red. Some of the chemicals they use in the mining pools, they just dump into the waters,"" he told DW.DW met both Lahtaw Kai and Seng Li on the sidelines of a recent tour of Europe, where they were campaigning for support of their cause. They want to make Europeans aware of what happens at the beginning of global supply chains that finally lead to products such as electric vehicles, wind turbines, medical equipment, and even weapons.Julie Klinger, assistant professor at the University of Delaware in the United States, explains that the term rare-earth elements refers to 17 chemically similar elements in the so-called periodic table of elements.""The thing that distinguishes these elements is their fantastic, magnetic and conductive, and in some cases thermal properties,"" she told DW.Also called the ""spice of industry,"" rare earths can be used in relatively small quantities to enhance industrial processes.Dysprosium, for example, is used as a catalyst in petrochemical refining, said Klinger, and can be found in Myanmar's north. The element with a metallic silver luster is essential for battery production, increasing their heat efficiency and longevity, making it a key component for the green energy transition.Dysprosium is also used in producing permanent magnets capable of maintaining a constant magnetic field needed for modern power generators in electric vehicles or wind turbines.Nonprofit organization Global Witness reported in 2024 that Chinese producers of permanent magnets are sourcing rare earths from Myanmar.Among the customers of China-made rare-earths products specifically named by the report are global auto giants Volkswagen , Toyota, Nissan, Ford and Hyundai, as well as wind power firms like Siemens Gamesa and Vestas.Another report compiled by Adams Intelligence— a consultancy for strategic metals and minerals based in Toronto, Canada — found Germany to be China's biggest customer for sourcing permanent magnets in 2024.China has reduced domestic mining for rare-earth elements, increasing the exploitation of deposits in neighboring Myanmar.Chinese imports of so-called heavy rare earth elements from Myanmar skyrocketed from their previous highs of 19,500 tons in 2021 to 41,700 tons in 2023, the Global Witness report says.""That's like a page out of the US playbook from the 20th century,"" said Julie Klinger, referring to the US approach of strategically not mining its domestic uranium deposits to safeguard them for later.Lahtaw Kai says people in Myanmar don't want the Chinese to continue mining, and adds: ""If the international community wants to continue buying these minerals, they should be responsibly sourced.""Myanmar's lucrative trade in rare earths — worth $1.4 billion (€1.2 billion) in 2023, according to Global Witness — risks financing conflict and destruction in a highly volatile region.In 2018, Myanmar’s civilian-led government had banned exports and ordered Chinese miners to wind down operations, but since 2021, extraction has continued in the context of a ruthless dictatorship and widening civil conflict.In late 2024, the Kachin Independence Organization (KIO) and its allied military forces wrested control of most of the mineral-rich region in the north from forces allied with the central government. KIO has been fighting for the region's independence since the 1960s.This power shift has led to new negotiations between KIO and Chinese producers on taxing rare earth extraction.While the KIO enjoys broad popular support in Kachin and greater legitimacy than government-allied militias, the 2024 Global Witness report says that on ""both sides, this largely unregulated mining is environmentally devastating, and the threat it poses to ecosystems and to human health is becoming ever more urgent.""Lahtaw Kai and Seng Li demand more public oversight of safety at the operations.""So far, civil society groups and the people have been excluded from the process of policy-making on mining [...] international organizations and governments should directly engage with the KIO to strengthen their governance,"" said Seng Li.And although Seng Li doesn't think rare-earth mining can be stopped, he said conditions must be improved to ""benefit not only the armed actors and the Chinese investors."" The local populations and the state should ""share the benefits, through systematic and regulated processes.""","Rare earth elements are crucial industrial inputs for electric vehicles, wind turbines, medical equipment, and even weapons.

Poll Do you believe that Afghanistan is adequately prepared for natural disasters? Yes No





An earthquake of magnitude 4.2 struck Afghanistan in the early hours of Sunday, marking the fifth tremor to jolt the country in just over a week. According to the National Center for Seismology (NCS), the latest earthquake occurred at 6.33am IST at a depth of 135 kms.So far, there have been no confirmed reports of injuries or structural damage, though assessments are still underway.The region experienced four previous earthquakes between May 16 and May 20. On Monday, May 19, a 4.2 magnitude quake was recorded. A day earlier, on May 18, a slightly stronger 4.5 magnitude earthquake struck at a depth of 150 kms. Prior to that, quakes of magnitudes 4.2 and 4.0 were reported on May 17 and 16, respectively.The recent spike in seismic activity has raised concerns among experts and residents alike. Afghanistan, particularly the Hindu Kush region, is recognised as a seismically active zone due to its location along the collision boundary between the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates. A major fault line also runs through the western province of Herat, further amplifying the region’s vulnerability.The International Red Cross and the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) have frequently highlighted Afghanistan’s susceptibility to natural disasters, including earthquakes, landslides, and seasonal flooding.More information is awaited as monitoring agencies continue to assess the impact.","The latest earthquake occurred at 6.33am IST at a depth of 135 kms.

Alan Yentob, a pioneering figure in British broadcasting and the creative force behind decades of acclaimed BBC content, has died aged 78, his family confirmed on Saturday.Yentob joined the BBC in 1968 as a trainee and went on to become one of its most influential and recognisable figures. His long career spanned roles including controller of BBC One and Two, head of music and arts, director of television, and the organisation's first creative director, a position he held for more than a decade.His wife, Philippa Walker, paid tribute, calling Yentob “curious, funny, annoying, late and creative in every cell of his body,” and remembered him as “the kindest of men and a profoundly moral man.” She added, “Our life was exciting, he was exciting.”Yentob was widely celebrated for his contribution to arts programming. He edited and presented acclaimed series like Arena, Omnibus and Imagine, which profiled major cultural figures including David Bowie , Maya Angelou, Grayson Perry, and Charles Saatchi. His 1975 Omnibus documentary Cracked Actor, which followed a fragile but creatively explosive Bowie, remains one of his most iconic works.As per BBC, Yentob recalled it captured the singer at his “most fragile and exhausted.”BBC director-general Tim Davie described Yentob as “a creative force and a cultural visionary” whose “passion wasn’t performative – it was personal.” He added, “To work with Alan was to be inspired and encouraged to think bigger. He believed in the power of culture to enrich, challenge and connect us.”According to The Guardian, Davie also said Yentob had “a rare gift for identifying talent and lifting others up – a mentor and champion to so many across the worlds of television, film and theatre.”During his leadership at BBC Two from 1988, Yentob helped launch Absolutely Fabulous, Have I Got News for You and The Late Show. His work was influential in shaping the broadcaster’s arts and comedy output, and he also helped develop children's channels CBBC and CBeebies.Born in London in 1947 into an Iraqi Jewish family, Yentob grew up in Greater Manchester and studied law at the University of Leeds. When he joined the BBC World Service, he was the only non-Oxbridge graduate among his peers that year, reported The Guardian.Yentob's career wasn't without controversy. In 2015, he resigned as the BBC’s creative director amid scrutiny over his role as chairman of the charity Kids Company, which collapsed the same year. He denied any conflict of interest but admitted the coverage had become a “serious distraction” for the broadcaster, according to the BBC.Despite this, he continued producing content and was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 2024 for services to the arts and media.Tributes have poured in from colleagues and friends. Actress Dawn French posted a photo with Yentob and Jennifer Saunders, calling him “our advocate from the start” and “a tip top chap.” The Pet Shop Boys called him “a legend in British TV” on social media, noting he was behind some of the BBC’s “finest programmes.”BBC Radio 4 presenter Amol Rajan called him “a towering figure in the culture of post-war Britain” and described his shows as “always brilliant, often masterpieces, sometimes seminal.” Rajan added: “He oozed fortitude until the very last… one of the most generous, influential, singular, passionate, supportive, creative and loved men of his generation.”Yentob is survived by his wife, Philippa Walker, and their two children.","Alan Yentob, a pioneering figure in British broadcasting, has died aged 78.

UK renationalises first train operator under Labour reforms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-renationalises-first-train-operator-under-labour-reforms/articleshow/121392033.cms,"Representative Image (AI-generated)

Public good:





A private train operator servicing parts of southern England, including London, on Sunday became the first to be returned to public ownership under a government plan to renationalise Britain's much-maligned railways.All UK rail operators are due to be renationalised within the next two years in a key policy launched by Prime Minister Keir Starmer following his Labour party's return to government last July after 14 years in opposition.""South Western Railway is now under public ownership. And this is just the start,"" Starmer said on X, naming the service kickstarting his government's plan.He vowed the renationalisation ""will put passengers first"", with ""better services, with simpler ticketing, on more comfortable trains"".Train passengers in Britain suffer from frequent cancellations, in addition to high ticket prices and regular confusion over which services they can be used on.The privatisation of rail operations took place in the mid-1990s under the Conservative prime minister of the time, John Major, but the rail network remained public, run by Network Rail.Four of the 14 operators in England are already run by the state owing to poor performance in recent years, but this was originally meant to be a temporary fix before a return to the private sector.Labour triumphed over the Conservative party in elections last year, with its manifesto including promises to fix the country's ailing transport services.Legislation was approved in November to bring rail operators into public ownership when the private companies' contracts expire -- or sooner in the event of poor management -- and be managed by ""Great British Railways"".Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said in a statement that will end ""30 years of fragmentation"", but warned that ""change isn't going to happen overnight"".""We've always been clear that public ownership isn't a silver bullet, but we are really firing this starting gun in that race for a truly 21st-century railway, and that does mean refocusing away from private profit and towards the public good,"" she added.In an example of how passengers might not immediately notice much difference, South Western's first service under public ownership on Sunday was set to include a rail replacement bus because of engineering work.Government figures show that the equivalent of 4 per cent of train services in Britain were cancelled in the year to April 26.The rate was 3 per cent for South Western.Rail unions -- which have staged a stream of strikes in recent years over pay and conditions due to a cost-of-living crisis -- welcomed the state takeover.""We're delighted that Britain's railways are being brought back where they belong -- into the public sector,"" said Mick Whelan, general secretary of union Aslef.""Everyone in the rail industry knows that privatisation... didn't, and doesn't, work,"" he added.Two operators serving towns and cities in southeastern and eastern England are next to be brought back into public ownership by late 2025.All the current contracts are set to expire by 2027.UK media reported that the renationalisation of South Western means a third of journeys are now on publicly owned services.The government has said renationalisation will save up to £150 million ($200 million) per year because it will no longer have to pay compensation fees to rail operators.The main rail operators in Scotland and Wales, where transport policy is handled by the devolved administrations in Edinburgh and Cardiff, are also state-owned.","South Western Railway is the first UK train operator to be returned to public ownership.

EDINBURGH: The Scottish Government has reaffirmed its commitment to supporting religious freedom and human rights for the Tibetan people, especially concerning the reincarnation of the 14th Dalai Lama , as reported by the central tibetan administration (CTA).In a session of the Scottish Parliament held on May 22, MSP Ross Greer raised inquiries about the Scottish government's preparations to celebrate the upcoming 90th birthday of the 14th Dalai Lama alongside the Buddhist community in Scotland and highlighted concerns over potential Chinese interference in the reincarnation process, as noted by the CTA.In reply, the minister for equalities Kaukab Stewart, expressed the Scottish Government's gratitude for the contributions made by various faith and belief communities in Scotland, including Buddhists.She conveyed warm wishes to Dalai Lama and the Buddhist community, acknowledging their vital role in promoting peace, compassion, and cultural diversity in the country, as emphasised in the CTA report.MSP Ross Greer also reminded everyone of the Chinese government's abduction of the six-year-old Panchen Lama three decades ago and the subsequent replacement with another boy.Greer articulated concerns that are widely held among Tibetans regarding the possibility of similar interference regarding the reincarnation of the 14th Dalai Lama in the future.He inquired if the Scottish Government would commit to recognising only a future Dalai Lama chosen according to Tibetan Buddhist traditions and teachings, free from outside influence.Stewart asserted, ""The Scottish Government upholds the principles of religious freedom and human rights. It believes that the Tibetan Buddhist community should have the autonomy to select the next Dalai Lama without external interference,"" as stated by the CTA.Since the 1950s, Tibetans in China have experienced persecution following the Chinese government's annexation of Tibet. The uprising of 1959 resulted in the Dalai Lama's exile and escalated repression. Tibetan culture, language, and religion have been systematically suppressed.Numerous reports indicate that within China, monasteries are strictly regulated, and religious practices face limitations.

"British soldiers climb Mount Everest in 5 days, create history",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/british-soldiers-climb-mount-everest-in-5-days-create-history/articleshow/121362464.cms,"

What made this climb to Mount Everest so unique?

The role of xenon gas

The record-breaking journey



Reactions from the mountaineering world

Concerns over tourism and fairness

Why did they do it?



A new chapter or a dangerous trend?





Four former British special forces soldiers have climbed Mount Everest in just under five days, setting a new record for the fastest ascent without traditional acclimatisation in the Himalayas. The team, which included UK veterans minister Alastair Carns, used a combination of high-tech training methods and controversial xenon gas therapy to prepare their bodies for the extreme altitude. Typically, climbers spend up to two months gradually adjusting to low oxygen levels on the mountain. Their swift summit has sparked both praise for innovation and concern over safety and fairness in high-altitude mountaineering.Most climbers follow a slow and steady route to the Everest summit, moving between various camps to allow their bodies to adapt to the thin air. This team, however, skipped the usual six to eight weeks of on-mountain acclimatisation. Instead, they underwent a three-month pre-acclimatisation programme using special tents that simulated high-altitude conditions. These ""hypoxic tents"" reduce oxygen levels to mimic the atmosphere found at extreme elevations, training the body to cope with lower oxygen.What set this expedition apart was their use of xenon gas. Administered in a clinic in Germany two weeks before their climb, the gas is claimed to help the body produce more red blood cells, which are essential for carrying oxygen. Supporters say it may reduce the risk of altitude sickness. However, experts remain divided. The International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation has warned that there is no strong scientific evidence backing its effectiveness and has raised concerns about safety.The team began their ascent from Everest base camp on 16 May and reached the summit early on 21 May, taking four days and 18 hours in total. Accompanied by five Sherpa guides and a cameraman, they used supplemental oxygen during the climb, a standard practice on Everest. Their rapid push to the top was made possible by their intensive preparation and favourable weather conditions.While the speed of the ascent has been applauded by some for its efficiency and low environmental impact, others in the mountaineering community are sceptical. Critics argue that such short expeditions risk encouraging dangerous shortcuts and undermine the traditional methods that have kept climbers safe. Some have even called for regulations to be updated to address the growing use of unconventional acclimatisation techniques.Expedition organisers in Nepal worry that if more climbers adopt these fast-track methods, it could shorten the duration of future expeditions and reduce income for local businesses and guides. There is also concern about the ethical implications of using performance-enhancing methods in a sport where physical and mental endurance are key to success. Nepal’s tourism department has stated it was unaware of the team’s methods and will now review the situation.According to expedition organiser Lukas Furtenbach, a shorter climb reduces the climbers' exposure to the dangers of high altitude and has a smaller environmental impact. He believes such techniques could represent the future of high-altitude climbing. However, others argue that these shortcuts could compromise safety and the spirit of mountaineering.The British team's ascent is undeniably a milestone in the history of Everest expeditions. But as more climbers consider high-speed climbs using advanced technology, the debate continues over whether innovation is enhancing the sport or risking its integrity. For now, the climb has stirred global conversation about how far mountaineers should go in the pursuit of speed and success.",Four former British special forces soldiers have climbed Mount Everest in just under five days.

What is the Kneecap controversy? Pro-Palestine Band charged with terror offences,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/what-is-the-kneecap-controversy-pro-palestine-band-charged-with-terror-offences/articleshow/121360089.cms,"What is Kneecap?



How the Kneecap controversy started?



Terror charge and legal proceedings

Political activism and support for Palestine

Rise to global fame through film

Controversial performances and symbolism



Footage and investigations

Public apology and Band response

Cancelled shows and political reaction





Kneecap, an Irish Band, hailed as cultural disruptors by supporters and branded dangerous extremists by critics, has been thrust into the global spotlight after one of its members was charged with a terror offence in the United Kingdom. Liam Og O hAnnaidh, known on stage as Mo Chara, faces charges related to allegedly displaying a Hezbollah flag during a performance in London. This legal development follows a series of controversies involving the band’s outspoken support for the Palestinian cause, provocative performances, and incendiary lyrics that have drawn fierce political and media backlash. The trio’s actions have prompted investigations, concert cancellations, and calls for bans, all while igniting intense debates about the limits of artistic freedom, political expression, and national security.Formed in 2017, Kneecap is a politically charged rap trio from west Belfast, composed of Mo Chara (Liam Og O hAnnaidh), Moglai Bap (Naoise O Caireallain), and DJ Provai (JJ O Dochartaigh). Known for their fusion of Irish and English lyrics, the group embraces themes of resistance, identity, and satire, often courting controversy through provocative imagery and performances. All three members are fluent Irish speakers, and their music is seen as both a celebration and a defence of the Irish language.Their debut single, “CEARTA,” released during a campaign for Irish language rights in Northern Ireland, set the tone for their defiant public persona.The controversy escalated when London’s Metropolitan Police confirmed that Mo Chara had been charged with a terror offence under UK law. The charge stems from a performance on 21 November 2024, during which video footage appeared to show him displaying a Hezbollah flag and shouting slogans allegedly in support of proscribed terrorist groups. Both Hezbollah and Hamas are designated terrorist organisations in the UK, and it is illegal to publicly express support for them. Mo Chara is due to appear before Westminster Magistrates’ Court on 18 June. The UK’s Counter Terrorism Command was reportedly alerted to the video in April 2025, leading to the charge after consultation with the Crown Prosecution Service.On 21 May 2025, UK authorities officially charged Mo Chara (under the legal name Liam O’Hanna) with a terror offence. The charge relates to the alleged display of a Hezbollah flag during a concert at the O2 Forum in Kentish Town in November 2023. The Crown Prosecution Service authorised the charge following an investigation prompted by an online video. Mo Chara is scheduled to appear at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on 18 June.Kneecap’s strong pro-Palestinian stance has become a focal point of international attention. During their set at the Coachella festival in April 2025, the band displayed on-screen messages condemning Israel for genocide and accusing the United States of enabling war crimes. One message read: “F*** Israel. Free Palestine.” These statements triggered significant backlash from US commentators, including Sharon Osbourne, who called for their US work visas to be revoked and likened the group to a “Hamas fan club. ” The band’s manager later revealed they had received serious death threats as a result of their comments.Kneecap’s influence expanded rapidly following the release of their semi-fictionalised film in 2024, which starred Oscar-nominated actor Michael Fassbender. The film was both a critical and commercial success, earning six BAFTA nominations and winning for Outstanding Debut. It also secured four awards from the Irish Film and Television Academy, including Best Director for Rich Peppiatt. The film depicted the band’s origins, blending humour, music, and social commentary, and was praised by international outlets like The Independent, which called it “a sweary, crude, and brilliantly political Irish comedy. ”Throughout their career, Kneecap has attracted criticism for what some view as the glamorisation of drug use and militant Irish republicanism. They have worn balaclavas in the colours of the Irish flag during performances and sparked outrage by commissioning a mural in Belfast of a burning police Land Rover, seen by opponents as glorifying terrorism. Their lyrics and public appearances frequently contain anti-British sentiment, including a song titled “Get Your Brits Out” and chants calling for British withdrawal from Northern Ireland.Following Coachella, old videos resurfaced of Kneecap performances in London, allegedly showing Mo Chara displaying a Hezbollah flag and shouting slogans such as “Up Hamas, up Hezbollah.” Another clip included the statement: “The only good Tory is a dead Tory. Kill your local MP.” These incidents led to a criminal investigation by London’s Metropolitan Police, involving counter-terrorism officers. As both Hamas and Hezbollah are proscribed as terrorist organisations in the UK, expressions of support for them are criminal offences.Amid growing backlash, Kneecap issued an apology to the families of murdered British MPs Jo Cox and David Amess, stating they never intended to incite violence and expressed regret for any pain caused. The group reaffirmed their message of “love, inclusion, and hope” and rejected claims of promoting terrorism. They also alleged they were the target of a “coordinated smear campaign,” particularly from the United States, and announced plans to pursue legal action against what they described as malicious misinformation.As the controversy intensified, several of Kneecap’s scheduled concerts in the UK and Germany were cancelled. The British government urged Glastonbury organisers to reconsider the band’s participation in the upcoming festival. Politicians, including UK Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, called for Kneecap to be banned entirely from performing. In contrast, a group of artists including Pulp, Annie Mac, Massive Attack, Paul Weller, and Primal Scream signed an open letter in support of the band’s right to political expression.The Kneecap controversy has become a flashpoint in debates over free speech, artistic freedom, and the boundaries of political activism in music. While their supporters view the band as fearless truth-tellers and cultural revolutionaries, critics argue that their methods flirt with extremism and incite division. As legal proceedings continue, the world will be watching to see how the justice system, the music industry, and public discourse respond to a band that has consistently refused to play by the rules.","Liam Og O hAnnaidh, known on stage as Mo Chara, faces charges related to allegedly displaying a Hezbollah flag during a performance in London.

Justice secretary exploring mandatory chemical castration for some sex offenders





Lord high chancellor of Great Britain, Shabana Mahmood is considering introducing mandatory chemical castration for the most dangerous sex offenders in England and Wales, United Kingdom. According to government sources, the proposal is part of a broader effort to address prison overcrowding and reform the criminal justice system.Chemical castration involves the use of drugs to reduce sexual urges. These drugs include Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) that reduces intrusive sexual thoughts and anti-androgens that lowers testosterone levels.Currently, the programme is voluntary, but Mahmood is looking at whether it could be made compulsory for high-risk offenders. A pilot programme using these drugs began in 2022 in south-west England and is due to end next year. Officials are planning to expand the trial to 20 more regions before considering a national rollout.The proposal is part of recommendations made by former conservative justice secretary David Gauke. He suggested that the government should gather more evidence on the effectiveness of these drugs and study the application in countries like Germany, Denmark and Poland.Mahmood is expected to address the issue in Parliament this week. At the end of March 2025, sexual offences made up to 21 per cent of all adult prison sentences, as reported by the Guardian.Gauke recommended that short prison sentences of under 12 months should be used only in rare cases. Instead, courts should have more options, like longer suspended sentences, delayed sentencing for low-risk offenders, and greater use of fines or bans (such as travel or driving restrictions).To support victims, expand courts that deal with domestic abuse and increase the use of electronic tags for those who commit violence against women and girls. It also calls for better training for judges and legal professionals on these issues. Additionally, change the statutory purpose of sentencing so judges and magistrates must consider protecting victims as much as they consider punishment and rehabilitation when passing sentences.He warned that these reforms will only succeed with more funding including expanding the availability of electronic monitoring equipment like tags.The Conservative Party has strongly criticised Gauke's recommendations. Shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick said, “By scrapping short prison sentences Starmer is effectively decriminalising crimes like burglary, theft and assault. This is a gift to criminals who will be free to offend with impunity,” as reported by the Guardian.",Justice secretary exploring mandatory chemical castration for some sex offenders.

a 4.5% rise for members of the UK armed forces, with 3.75% for senior military staff.



Concerns around funding





Doctors and teachers in England have been granted a pay hike by 4 per cent, after the government accepted the salary recommendations made by pay review bodies.According to BCC, the reaction from the majority of education unions have been positive and welcoming, with a caveat that spending cuts given no extra funding to school budgets might hamper covering costs.But the health unions have reacted sharply to just 3.6% rise to other NHS staff including nurses and midwives. The British Medical Association (BMA) said an appraisal of 5.4% to resident doctors, was “woefully inadequate” and they would put it to vote next week, mulling possible strike.Resident doctors staged 11 separate strikes throughout 2023 and 2024, demanding a 35% pay increase to compensate for 15 years of below-inflation wage growth.They eventually received average pay increases totaling 22% over the past two years, which ended the strikes. However, the British Medical Association (BMA) maintains that this year’s pay offer still falls short of fully addressing the gap.Meanwhile, the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) criticized the smaller raise given to nurses compared to doctors, calling it “grotesque.” The RCN also condemned the current pay review process as flawed and biased, claiming it keeps nurses at the bottom of the pay scale.The union intends to consult its members to gauge satisfaction with the pay offer. If nurses reject it, the RCN may proceed with a formal ballot to consider industrial action.A series of announcements on Thursday confirmed:The recently out inflation numbers, which unexpectedly rose to a high of 3.5% have only complicated the matter. With unions representing junior civil servants, PCS contrasted their latest raise proposal of 3.25% with these figures.Health Secretary Wes Streeting called the pay increase for nurses ""above inflation,"" but the Royal College of Nursing argued that rising costs would completely offset the raise.Meanwhile, the Institute for Fiscal Studies noted that the 4% pay offer for teachers would likely amount to only a modest real-terms increase, as official forecasts project inflation at 3.2% for the current financial year.The pay increases follow the government's acceptance of recommendations from several pay review bodies, which advise on salaries for about 45% of the public sector workforce.These awards exceed the 2.8% initially allocated by the Treasury, with ministers stating that most of the additional costs will need to be covered through existing departmental budgets.The education department has allocated an extra £615 million to help fund the increases, though it noted that schools would be expected to contribute through ""improved productivity and smarter spending.""The National Education Union, representing teachers, warned the pay rise was ""not fully funded"" and cautioned it could result in ""cuts in service provision"" for many schools.NEU’s general secretary Daniel Kebde said to BBC, said his union will undertake discussion on the offer and strike was “highly unlikely” with “broader acceptance”.""The question is the issue of funding. Members care deeply about that, and of course will want us to campaign heavily on it,"" he added.The health department maintained that it could secure the additional funding for the pay increases without affecting ""frontline services.""It pointed to savings from lowering reliance on temporary staff, eliminating ""duplication and waste,"" and implementing its plan to dissolve NHS England as potential sources of funding.Labour brought an end to prolonged public sector strikes last summer by agreeing to recommended pay increases ranging from 4.75% to 6% for the previous year.Ministers defended the decision as necessary to prevent harm to the economy, though it drew criticism from Conservatives, who claimed the government had lost control over public sector pay.Shadow health secretary Edward Argar said: ""We warned Labour that the unions would simply come back for more when they gave into the strikes and agreed to above inflation pay demands with no strings attached.""The government needs to get a grip, say how they'll pay for above inflation pay rises without taking money from services for patients, and to stand up to the unions by negotiating a fair affordable deal for taxpayers"".","Doctors and teachers in England have been granted a pay hike by 4 per cent, after the government accepted the salary recommendations made by pay review bodies.

For the past three years, many young men in Russia have been doing everything they can to avoid getting sent to fight in the war against Ukraine. But some Russians are enthusiastically signing up for service in what President Vladimir Putin has called the battle for his nation's survival by joining a drone brigade offering short stints far from the fighting.Pro-war Russian bloggers have described the unit, Kaskad, as a ""sinecure for officials."" Based in an undisclosed location in a part of Ukraine occupied by Russia, it provides a career boost to politically minded recruits, according to Kremlin watchers and military analysts who call Kaskad a ""VIP unit.""Thousands of men have been called up to fight in Ukraine since 2022 and have been kept at the front as a terrible toll mounts by the day. But stints with Kaskad tend to be short-term. And given it's a drone unit away from the front lines, the chances of being put in danger's way are relatively small, analysts say.Officials assigned to the unit usually stay three to eight months, get plenty of photo ops with automatic rifles and return to their jobs with a hero's welcome, according to numerous social media posts in which recruits have documented their deployments, and accounts pieced together by analysts.""Enlistment with Kaskad allows elite figures to sidestep statutory military service requirements with guaranteed safety and potentially curry favor with Kremlin,"" Britain's defence ministry said last year.More than 270 pro-Kremlin regional lawmakers and 200 members of the youth wing of governing United Russia party have served in the Russian army in Ukraine, said Andrei Turchak, the party's chairman. At least six members of parliament, dozens of pro-Kremlin youth activists and even one cosmonaut have done so in Kaskad.In Nov, 12 senior members of United Russia's youth wing in St Petersburg joined Kaskad on the same day. Among them was Aleksandr Malikov, who promptly updated his profile picture on social media, which shows a clean-shaven man, wearing sunglasses and cradling an automatic rifle, standing in front of a building with shattered windows and smoldering rubble. Just a few months earlier, Malikov was documenting his life as a local council member.Malikov described his decision to enlist as a patriotic duty but declined to describe his role at Kaskad. ""Here, I keep on doing the same thing I've been doing for many years: supporting my country and taking an active role where I'm needed.""Dmitri V Sablin, a longstanding member of parliament, has been commanding Kaskad since 2022. In 2023, a camouflage-clad Sablin introduced a Kaskad team to reporters. Footage showed two soldiers launching a combat drone from a field and others monitoring drone flights on a computer from a bunker. Kaskad has at least 54 crews operating 10 types of reconnaissance and combat drones along the front line, Sablin said.Stints in Kaskad have been helpful for the careers of some of its veterans. Yevgeny Pervyshov, for instance, was a low-ranking member of parliament when he joined Kaskad in Nov 2022. After his stint with the brigade, he was spotted by Putin at a televised meeting and offered a job.

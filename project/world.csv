FBI Uncovers SHOCKING DNA Proof Against Charlie Kirk Assassin Tyler Robinson; Chilling Note Exposed

Who is Tyler Robinson?







FBI director Kash Patel on Monday revealed a key development in the investigation into the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk . Patel said the agency has recovered a “text thread” in which the alleged shooter, Tyler Robinson, wrote that he had the chance to kill Kirk and planned to act out of “hatred that cannot be negotiated with. ”In an appearance on Fox News’ “Fox & Friends,” FBI director Patel said investigators believe Tyler Robinson also wrote a physical note stating he had the “opportunity to take out Charlie Kirk” and would do so. Patel said the note was destroyed, but investigators have gathered forensic evidence proving it once existed and confirmed its contents through interviews.“I will say what was found in terms of information, a text message exchange where he, the suspect specifically stated that he had the opportunity to take out Charlie Kirk and he was gonna do that,” FBI director said.He added, “When he was asked why, he said some hatred cannot be negotiated with.”“I can report today that the DNA hits from the towel that was wrapped around the firearm and the DNA on the screwdriver are positively processed for the suspect in custody,” Patel told Fox & Friends.Investigators have not yet publicly disclosed a motive in the case. Law enforcement officials say they believe Robinson acted alone in the shooting of Kirk but are still examining whether anyone else may have been involved in planning the attack.Separately, the Washington Post reported Monday that Robinson had sent a message on the online platform Discord apparently confessing to the crime on Thursday night, just before his arrest.“It was me at UVU yesterday. im sorry for all of this,” read a message from Robinson’s account, according to the newspaper, which cited two people familiar with the chat and screenshots it had reviewed.Kirk, 31, a MAGA star, was shot dead last week during an outdoor event at Utah Valley University. He had been speaking and taking questions about the long-running culture of mass shootings and gun violence in America when the attack took place.US President Donald Trump , visibly affected by the death of his young ally, confirmed Kirk’s killing on Truth Social.He also posted a four-minute video calling the murder “an assassination” and remembering Kirk as “a patriot who devoted his life to open debate and the country he loved so much.”The suspect, arrested and identified by authorities for Kirk's assassination is a 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, a Utah resident.Robinson is a third-year student in the electrical apprenticeship programme at Dixie Technical College in St. George, Utah.State records show Robinson is a registered voter but unaffiliated with any political party. He did not vote in the two most recent general elections, despite being of voting age.","FBI director Kash Patel revealed a key development in the investigation into the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

Illinois television reporter Beni Rae Harmony has resigned after being suspended for delivering an emotional on-air tribute to conservative activist Charlie Kirk , who was assassinated last week while speaking at Utah Valley University.During her Friday broadcast on Springfield’s ABC affiliate WICS, Harmony paused to reflect on Kirk’s death. “Two days ago, I lost a mentor, my first boss, the first person who made me believe in myself,” she told viewers. Calling Kirk someone who encouraged her to chase her career, she urged audiences to lean on one another and stand up for their beliefs.She recalled one of Kirk’s sayings: “When conversations stop happening, when individuals become wordless, that’s when violence begins.” Harmony closed her remarks by thanking Kirk directly: “You changed my life.”The station suspended her following the broadcast, prompting Harmony to announce her resignation on social media. In a post on X, she wrote: “Effective immediately, I have resigned from @WICS\_ABC20 after being SUSPENDED for airing a non-partisan tribute to Charlie Kirk this past Friday. Many in the mainstream media have been fired or punished for mocking his assassination.I believe I am the first to be targeted for honouring him on air. ”She continued: “My resignation is guided by values that are essential to who I am, which I refuse to set aside in order to keep a job.

'Make Memphis safe again': Donald Trump signs presidential order to curb crime in city; hints at Chicago next,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/make-memphis-safe-again-donald-trump-signs-presidential-order-to-curb-crime-in-city-hints-at-chicago-next/articleshow/123911383.cms,"Donald Trump (AP image)

Donald Trump Calls Chicago War Plans ‘Fake News’, Vows To Clean Up The City | Watch





In a major move aimed at curbing crime in Tennessee, President Donald Trump on Monday signed an executive order establishing the Memphis Safe Task Force, which will send National Guard troops to the city alongside federal law enforcement agencies.Speaking from the Oval Office, Trump said the effort would replicate the administration’s ongoing military-led response to urban crime in Democratic-run cities.“We’re going to fix that just like we did Washington,” he said, pledging to end the “savagery” and to “make Memphis safe again.”The task force will include personnel from the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the US Marshals Service and the Department of Justice. The deployment, Trump said, is aimed at targeting career criminals and restoring public safety.While signing the executive order, President Trump said, ""This team will deploy the full powers of federal law enforcement agencies... to restore public safety and get dangerous career criminals off our streets. In 2024, Memphis had the highest violent crime rate, the highest property crime rate, and the third highest murder rate of any city in the nation.""Tennessee Governor Bill Lee welcomed the move. “I’m tired of crime holding the great city of Memphis back,” Lee said. Trump told the governor that the crackdown “will be your proudest moment” and predicted that violent crime would “plummet” within weeks.The signing was attended by Tennessee’s Republican senators, Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty. Trump has previously deployed federal forces to Washington DC, despite violent crime in the city being at a 30-year low.In a post on X, Rapid Response shared Memphis’s crime statistics. According to the post, in 2024 the city recorded the highest violent and property crime rates in the US, with its murder rate ranking third nationally. Violent crime was reported to be 344% above the national average, while the city’s murder rate was four times higher than Mexico City, 27 times higher than Havana, and 37 times higher than London.Speculation had pointed to Chicago as the next city where President Trump might deploy the National Guard and other federal authorities, as reported by the Guardian.""We’re going to be doing Chicago probably next”, the US President said. “We don’t want to lose Chicago,” he added noting that he has a “great, beautiful building” on the city’s skyline.Trump also suggested that St Louis, New Orleans and Baltimore could be potential future targets for similar federal interventions. “We want to save these places,” he said.The president stressed that the administration will proceed with crime-fighting measures even if local leaders do not fully cooperate. “We hope we have the governor’s help,” he said. “But if we don’t, we’re doing it without him.”","President Donald Trump signed an executive order establishing the Memphis Safe Task Force.

Setback for Trump?

U.S. Dollar CRASHES Hours After Trump's Unprecedented Move Against Fed Governor Cook | Details





A federal appeals court has ruled that Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook can remain in her post, allowing her to take part in this week’s closely watched interest rate meeting, despite President Donald Trump’s attempt to remove her from the board. The decision from the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit came on Monday, hours after Trump announced Cook’s dismissal in a letter posted on Truth Social, accusing her of mortgage fraud.“In light of your deceitful and potentially criminal conduct in a financial matter, [Americans] cannot and I do not have such confidence in your integrity,” Trump wrote. “I have determined that there is sufficient cause to remove you from your position.” Cook, the first Black woman to serve on the Fed’s board, has denied the allegations and pledged not to be “bullied to step down.” She has also filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, arguing that the accusations are unrelated to her role at the central bank and remain unproven.The allegations originated with Bill Pulte, head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, who claimed Cook had listed more than one home as her primary residence in 2021 to secure favourable mortgage terms.The Justice Department has since opened an investigation, with subpoenas issued in Georgia and Michigan, and reports suggesting a grand jury in Atlanta is examining the case. Cook has not been charged, and her legal filing describes the allegations as a pretext to force her out and open a seat for Trump to fill.Legal experts say the case raises fundamental questions about the independence of the Federal Reserve. Governors can only be removed “for cause,” a standard that historically covers proven misconduct or neglect. Trump’s move marks the first attempt by a president to fire a sitting Fed governor in the institution’s 112-year history, and observers expect the dispute could reach the Supreme Court.The legal fight comes as the Fed begins a two-day policy meeting, with markets anticipating a rate cut of at least 25 basis points. Investors are watching closely for signals of further easing as the US economy slows and trade talks with China continue.","Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook can remain in her post, despite President Donald Trump's attempt to remove her from the board.

‘STOP PROTECTING ISRAEL’: Qatar PM’s ‘Direct Attack’ On Trump | Watch FULL English Speech





US President Donald Trump urged Israel to be “very careful” in its actions concerning Qatar, highlighting the Gulf nation’s role as a key ally of the United States.Speaking to reporters at Morristown Airport, Trump was asked whether he had a message for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu following last week’s airstrikes on Hamas leaders in Qatar, which reportedly failed to eliminate their targets, Times of Israel reported.“My message is that they have to be very, very careful. They have to do something about Hamas, but Qatar has been a great ally to the United States. A lot of people don’t know that,” Trump said.The US President's remarks come days after he hosted Qatar’s Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani for dinner in New York.Trump described the Qatari leader as a “wonderful person” and said he had advised Qatar to improve its public image. “People talk of it so badly, and they shouldn’t be,” Trump added.Trump was joined at the dinner by Middle East Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, as the president marked the anniversary of the September 11 attacks in New York.“Great dinner with POTUS. Just ended,” Qatar’s deputy chief of mission, Hamah Al-Muftah, said in a post on X.The meeting followed an Israeli strike in Doha that killed six people, including a Qatari security officer, though Hamas leaders escaped unharmed.The attack, which took place in the Katara district, drew condemnation from Qatar as “state terrorism.”Earlier, US President has expressed concern over the strike, saying he was “not thrilled about the whole situation” and warning that it could undermine ongoing efforts to secure a fragile Gaza ceasefire.“I’m not thrilled about the whole situation. It’s not a good situation,” he told reporters at the White House. “But I will say this, we want the hostages back, but we are not thrilled about the way that went down,” he added.The US President sought to distance himself from the strike, emphasizing that it “does not advance Israel or America’s goals,” and assured Qatar that such an incident would not be repeated.",US President Donald Trump urged Israel to be ‘very careful’ in its actions concerning Qatar.

'Calls For My Killing...': Nigel Farage Exposes Chilling 'Death Threats' After Charlie Kirk Murder





The US vice president JD Vance announced that he will host 'The Charlie Kirk Show' from the White House on Monday to pay tribute to his slain friend.The show is scheduled to air at noon, less than a week after Kirk was assassinated during a college campus visit in Utah.Vance and Kirk had been close friends for many years, long before Vance entered politics. In a letter to Kirk shared after his death at Utah Valley University, Vance reflected on their time together.He noted that Kirk was one of the first people he contacted when he decided to run for the US Senate in 2021 and that Kirk helped connect him with others who could support his campaign, including Donald Trump Jr.Vance described Kirk as one of his most dedicated advocates over the years, who even helped guide the selection process that ultimately led to Vance becoming vice-president.The vice president said he first learned about Kirk being shot through group messages with friends and government officials while in a meeting in the West Wing.“God didn’t answer those prayers, and that’s OK. He had other plans. And now that Charlie is in heaven, I’ll ask him to talk to big man directly on behalf of his family, his friends, and the country he loved so dearly,” Vance wrote.Vance had also accompanied Kirk’s body during transport from Utah to his home state of Arizona.Images from the flight show Kirk’s wife, Erika, dressed in black and holding their two young children, walking hand-in-hand with second lady Usha Vance. The vice president and uniformed service members helped carry the flag-draped casket onto the plane.Earlier, on Wednesday, Vance paid tribute to Kirk on social media, calling him “a true friend” and a major influence in his rise in national politics. Kirk, the conservative activist who was shot at Utah Valley University, helped shape Vance’s path from a MAGA outsider to the vice presidency.“Charlie was fascinated by ideas and always willing to learn and change his mind,” Vance wrote. “Like me, he was skeptical of Donald Trump in 2016. Like me, he came to see President Trump as the only figure capable of moving American politics away from the globalism that had dominated for our entire lives. When others were right, he learned from them. When he was right — as he usually was — he was generous.”Vance said Kirk was crucial to his 2022 Senate campaign in Ohio, assisting with strategy, fundraising, and grassroots connections. “He introduced me to some of the people who would run my campaign and also to Donald Trump Jr., who took a call from me because Charlie asked,” he wrote.Kirk's children also remained deeply involved with Vance’s family and they often spent time together.“Our kids, especially our oldest, struggled with the attention and the constant presence of the protective detail. I felt this acute sense of guilt that I had conscripted my kids into this life without getting their permission. And Charlie was constantly calling and texting, checking on our family and offering guidance and prayers,” Vance said.","US vice president JD Vance will host 'The Charlie Kirk Show' from the White House on Monday.

Chequers meeting with PM Keir Starmer





US President Donald Trump will make an unprecedented second state visit to the United Kingdom from September 16 to 18, accompanied by First Lady Melania Trump.Trump was previously hosted by the late Queen Elizabeth II in June 2019. Traditionally, US presidents serving a second term are not offered a state visit; instead, they are usually invited for tea or lunch with the monarch, as was the case with Barack Obama and George W Bush.However, in February, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer presented Trump with an invitation from King Charles III during a White House meeting on a UK-US trade deal. Keir called the invitation ""truly historic"" and ""unprecedented,"" while Trump described it as a ""great, great honour.""On the second day of the visit, Trump and Melania will travel to Windsor Castle, where they will be greeted by the Prince and Princess of Wales before a formal welcome by the King and Queen. A royal salute will be fired in Windsor and at the Tower of London.Trump will lay a wreath at St George’s Chapel on the tomb of Queen Elizabeth II. Later, a flypast featuring UK and US F-35 fighter jets and the Red Arrows will take place. That evening, a traditional state banquet will be held at Windsor Castle, during which both the King and the US president will deliver speeches.On the third day, Trump will meet Starmer at Chequers. The agenda includes viewing the Winston Churchill archives, holding talks, and delivering a joint news conference.During his 2019 state visit, Trump traveled on Air Force One, and his motorcade — including the armoured limousine The Beast — was flown in by US Air Force transport aircraft. The 2019 visit involved more than 6,300 police officers and cost 3.4 million pounds for London’s Metropolitan Police.","US President Donald Trump will make an unprecedented second state visit to the UK.

US President Donald Trump on Sunday struck an ambiguous note on the future of TikTok, suggesting that China would ultimately decide the app’s fate just days ahead of a September 17 deadline for its parent company ByteDance to sell its US assets or face a ban.“We may let it die, or we may, I don’t know — it depends, up to China,” Trump told reporters in New Jersey before returning to Washington.Trump has already pushed back the TikTok deadline three times since January. While lawmakers warn that the app poses national security risks, he has also credited it with helping him connect with younger voters during last year’s election.Last month, US President said that he had US buyers lined up for the app and signaled he could extend the deadline again. On Sunday, however, he sounded less certain. “It doesn’t matter too much. I’d like to do it for the kids. They like it,” he said.The president also pointed to TikTok’s role in his campaign outreach. “I did very well on TikTok, and I got the youth vote and I got numbers that nobody’s ever even come close to in the Republican Party,” he said.“Some was attributed to TikTok, and a lot was attributed to Charlie,” he added, referring to conservative activist Charlie Kirk who was assassinated on September 10 while speaking at Utah Valley University.Sources suggest that the administration is likely to grant another extension rather than force a shutdown this week. Such a move would give more time for negotiations but could frustrate lawmakers in Congress who have pressed for a clear decision on the platform, as reported by news agency Reuters.Meanwhile, American and Chinese officials held talks in Madrid on Sunday, where TikTok was part of a broader trade agenda. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer met Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng and top negotiator Li Chenggang.TikTok had not featured in earlier rounds of trade discussions in Geneva, London and Stockholm. Since beginning his second term in January, Trump has chosen not to enforce the law requiring TikTok’s US assets to be sold or shut down. Instead, he has pushed back the deadline three times, first to April, then to June and most recently to September.With the deadline approaching, a final agreement is unlikely, leaving the platform’s future uncertain.",TikTok's parent company ByteDance has until September 17 to sell its US assets or face a ban.

Understanding solar eclipses – Types and what to expect

Total solar eclipse



The Moon completely covers the Sun.

Observers in a narrow zone experience brief daylight darkness.

Spectacular but rare. Partial solar eclipse



Only part of the Sun is covered by the Moon.

Creates a crescent or “bitten” appearance of the Sun.

This is the type occurring on September 21, 2025. Annular solar eclipse



The Moon is farther from Earth and doesn’t fully cover the Sun.

A ring of sunlight remains visible, forming the “ring of fire” effect.





In an extraordinary celestial turn, September 2025 is bookended by two eclipses, a lunar eclipse on the 7th and a solar eclipse just 15 days later. While the Moon recently turned a vivid red in a dramatic lunar display, the sky will offer another rare phenomenon: a partial solar eclipse on September 21, timed just before the equinox. However, this spectacle won’t be visible everywhere, and the UAE is among the regions that will miss it.The final solar eclipse of 2025 is scheduled for September 21. Unlike a total eclipse, this will be a partial solar eclipse, where the Moon covers only part of the Sun, creating a crescent-shaped sliver of sunlight. Even as a partial eclipse, it provides a rare chance to observe the Sun’s changing face.This event holds additional significance because it closely precedes the September equinox, which falls on September 22, 2025. The equinox is one of two moments in the year when the Sun is directly above the Earth’s equator, resulting in nearly equal day and night lengths across the globe. Because of this timing, the eclipse is also being called an ""equinox eclipse"", adding to its astronomical and symbolic intrigue.The event also carries cultural and astrological meaning. This year's Pitru Paksha — a fortnight in the Hindu calendar dedicated to ancestral remembrance and rituals — uniquely begins with a lunar eclipse and ends with this solar eclipse, a rare alignment astrologers consider especially potent.This celestial pairing not only marks an important astronomical event but also deepens the spiritual significance of Pitru Paksha for many observers.Also Read: Saudi National Day 2025 The September 21 partial solar eclipse will be visible only in specific parts of the Southern Hemisphere, offering clear views to skywatchers in select regions.Skywatchers in visible regions must use proper solar filters or eclipse glasses to view the partial eclipse safely.Unlike the lunar eclipse on September 7, which had wide visibility across many countries, this solar eclipse will not be visible in the UAE or most parts of the Northern Hemisphere.Countries that will not witness any part of the eclipse include:This means millions of skywatchers across Asia and the Americas will miss the event entirely — a sharp contrast to the global excitement generated by the earlier lunar eclipse.A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon moves between the Earth and the Sun, partially or fully blocking sunlight in specific areas on Earth. These alignments don’t happen frequently in the same place due to the precise positioning required.There are three main types of solar eclipses:Although this particular eclipse is not a total one, its timing, rarity, and symbolic links to the equinox and Pitru Paksha make it a notable event in the 2025 celestial calendar.This will be the last solar eclipse of 2025, concluding a year that featured two solar eclipses","The final solar eclipse of 2025 is scheduled for September 21.

US President Donald Trump launched a $15 billion defamation lawsuit against the New York Times, accusing the paper of being a “mouthpiece” for Democrats and of waging a decades-long ""campaign of lies"" against him.In a post on Truth Social, the US president wrote: “Today, I have the Great Honor of bringing a $15 Billion Dollar Defamation and Libel Lawsuit against The New York Times, one of the worst and most degenerate newspapers in the History of our Country, becoming a virtual ‘mouthpiece’ for the Radical Left Democrat Party.”Trump claimed the Times’ endorsement of Kamala Harris, which he said was placed prominently on the front page, amounted to “the single largest illegal Campaign contribution, EVER.” He accused the paper of spreading falsehoods about him, his family, his business, and the America First movement.He added: “The New York Times has been allowed to freely lie, smear, and defame me for far too long, and that stops, NOW! The suit is being brought in the Great State of Florida.”The president also referenced what he described as past “successful litigation” against media outlets including ABC, CBS and Disney.Trump’s lawsuit against the New York Times follows a string of high-profile legal battles with major US broadcasters. Earlier this year, ABC News agreed to pay $15 million towards the president’s planned library to settle a defamation claim. The case centred on anchor George Stephanopoulos’ on-air remarks in which he inaccurately said Trump had been found liable for rape in the E. Jean Carroll case. The network issued an editor’s note expressing regret and covered an additional $1 million in legal fees.Paramount Global, the parent company of CBS, also reached a settlement after Trump sued over what he alleged was a deceptively edited interview with then-rival Kamala Harris aired on 60 Minutes. The company agreed to pay $16 million, again directed to Trump’s library project rather than to him directly. Trump’s legal team described the outcome as “a win for the American people” and proof, they argued, of widespread misconduct in mainstream media.Both settlements were struck in federal courts and avoided potentially damaging depositions.",US President Donald Trump has launched a $15 billion defamation lawsuit against the New York Times.

The Ukrainian president argued that such delays only give Moscow more time to prepare, adding that the Russian leader is actively trying to manipulate his way out of global isolation.Speaking in an exclusive interview with Sky News at the Presidential Palace in Kyiv, Zelenskyy said Putin had gained far too much from last month’s Alaska summit with Donald Trump, a meeting from which Ukraine was excluded. “He should have received a setback in this war and stop. But instead, he received de-isolation. He got the photos with President Trump. He received public dialogue, and I think this opens the doors for Putin into some other summits and formats,” he said.Zelenskyy added that Putin is “doing everything he can to avoid sanctions” and agreed when asked whether the Kremlin leader was trying to trick the US president. “If you keep postponing applying sanctions any further, then the Russians will be better prepared,” he warned.For Zelenskyy, the Russian president “only understands force” and must face much stronger measures to be compelled to end the war.The Ukrainian leader’s remarks come as Trump has urged Nato countries to stop importing Russian oil and floated tariffs of up to 100 per cent on China. While acknowledging that such steps “are understandable,” Zelenskyy insisted that the US should not wait on Europe or other partners before acting. “I think the US is strong enough on its own. They can make this happen quicker and all that’s lacking now is a strong sanctions package from the US,” he said.Zelenskyy expressed frustration that the West has failed to impose enough costs on Moscow even as Russian strikes continue, including recent incursions into NATO airspace over Poland and Romania. He cautioned that giving Putin diplomatic space only emboldens him. “It is very important not to give Mr Putin this space, because otherwise he won’t feel compelled that he has to stop the war,” he said.Until recently, the Trump administration also targeted India over its purchase of Russian oil, imposing an additional 25% tariff on top of a baseline of 25% tariff. New Delhi has called the move unreasonable and unjustified.",Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said it may be ‘understandable’ for Washington to impose tariffs on India and other nations for buying Russian oil.

Was Bob Vylan’s visa revoked after viral comments Charlie Kirk's killing? Here’s what happened,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/was-bob-vylans-visa-revoked-after-viral-comments-charlie-kirks-killing-heres-what-happened/articleshow/123911405.cms,"What happened in June







British punk duo Bob Vylan are facing renewed controversy after frontman Bobby Vylan branded slain US commentator Charlie Kirk “an absolute piece of shit of a human being” during a performance in Amsterdam last week. The remarks, which surfaced in viral clips online, sparked outrage among right-wing groups and prompted the cancellation of a planned concert in the Dutch city of Tilburg.During the Paradiso show, Bobby told the crowd: “The pronouns was/were. Cause if you chat shit you will get banged. Rest in peace Charlie Kirk, you piece of shit.” The UK branch of Turning Point, founded by Kirk, accused him of mocking and glorifying the murder.Responding to the backlash, Bobby denied celebrating Kirk’s death: “At no point during yesterday’s show was Charlie Kirk’s death celebrated … I did call him a piece of shit. That much is true. But at no point was his death celebrated.” He claimed one reporter had distorted his comments, adding: “Calm down.”The Tilburg venue 013 defended its cancellation, saying that while punk activism often pushed boundaries, “these new statements go too far.”The duo had already courted controversy earlier in June at Glastonbury, where Bobby led chants of “death to the IDF”, triggering a criminal investigation by Avon and Somerset police.In the immediate aftermath of the Glastonbury performance, the US State Department revoked the band’s visas, forcing the cancellation of a 19-date American tour. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau posted that foreigners who “glorify violence and hatred are not welcome visitors to our country.” British Prime Minister Keir Starmer called the chants “appalling hate speech”, while festival organiser Emily Eavis said the group had “very much crossed a line”.Despite clarifying that the chant was directed at the Israeli military and “not antisemitic”, the fallout continued. Boardmasters festival in Cornwall later faced a licensing challenge for allowing Bob Vylan to perform, though no incidents were reported.","Bobby Vylan branded slain US commentator Charlie Kirk “an absolute piece of shit of a human being” during a performance in Amsterdam last week.

JD Vance hosts 'The Charlie Kirk Show': US VP lashes out at liberals; recalls Erika’s tribute,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/jd-vance-hosts-the-charlie-kirk-show-us-vp-lashes-out-at-liberals-recalls-erikas-tribute/articleshow/123911323.cms,"



US Vice-President JD Vance has said that national unity is impossible with people who celebrate the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk , warning that such behaviour fuels further political violence.Speaking as guest host of The Charlie Kirk Show on Monday, Vance said: “Call them out, and hell, call their employer. We don't believe in political violence, but we do believe in civility.”The vice-president took over presenting duties from his ceremonial office at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, with the programme livestreamed into the White House press briefing room. It was the first episode of the podcast since Kirk, 31, was fatally shot in the neck while moderating a debate at Utah Valley University last week.Vance, who flew Kirk’s body home to Arizona aboard Air Force Two, said he was “filling in for somebody who cannot be filled in for”. He recounted conversations with Kirk’s widow Erika, describing him as “a kind, loving husband”, and admitted her words had inspired him to “be a better husband and… a better father”.In his remarks, Vance directly challenged those making light of Kirk’s assassination. “There is no unity with the people who celebrate Charlie Kirk's assassination,” he said.“There is no unity with someone who lies about what Charlie Kirk said in order to excuse his murder… And there is no unity with the people who fund these articles, who pay the salaries of these terrorist sympathisers who argue that Charlie Kirk, a loving husband and father, deserved a shot to the neck because he spoke words with which they disagree. ”He added: “I’m desperate for our country to be united in condemnation of the actions and the ideas that killed my friend. I want it so badly that I will tell you a difficult truth. We can only have it with people who acknowledge that political violence is unacceptable.”Other Republicans have echoed calls for accountability. Florida congressman Randy Fine said he would “demand their firing, defunding, and licence revocation”, while South Carolina’s Nancy Mace urged federal funding to be cut from universities that refuse to act.Vance, who described Kirk as a close friend and mentor, credited him with helping President Donald Trump’s re-election and with shaping the administration. “If it weren't for Charlie Kirk, I would not be the vice president of the United States,” he said.","US Vice-President JD Vance spoke as guest host of The Charlie Kirk Show.

‘Qatar Great Ally, Be Very Careful’: Donald Trump Blasts Netanyahu After Israel’s Doha Strike

.

Trump's 'NASTY' Ultimatum To Hamas After Shock Ceasefire Offer; Inside Look At New Deal I Details

Trump on Qatar strikes:

Netanyahu thanks President Trump:





US President Donald Trump on Monday (local time) issued a stern warning to Hamas, saying “all bets are off” if reports are confirmed that the group has moved hostages above ground to use them as human shields against Israel’s ongoing ground offensive in Gaza City.In a post on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump called the alleged move a “human atrocity” and demanded the immediate release of all hostages.“I have just read a News Report that Hamas has moved the hostages above ground to use them as human shields against Israel’s ground offensive. I hope the Leaders of Hamas know what they’re getting into if they do such a thing. This is a human atrocity, the likes of which few people have ever seen before. Don’t let this happen or, ALL “BETS” ARE OFF. RELEASE ALL HOSTAGES NOW!” Trump wrote.The warning comes as Israeli forces intensified airstrikes and reportedly pushed tanks into Gaza City, according to Palestinian media. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have been urging residents to evacuate the densely populated northern city, where hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians are still sheltering.The IDF has launched its ground offensive to take over Gaza City, Times of Israel reported quoting an Axios story that cited unnamed Israeli officials.In recent days, the army had expanded airstrikes in and around the city but had not previously sent ground troops into the urban center, where hundreds of thousands of civilians remain.According to the IDF, around 300,000 Palestinians have left Gaza City in recent weeks. The city’s population had grown to nearly one million displaced people earlier this year. The army has been urging residents to evacuate, but with limited success, as many fear other parts of the Strip are just as unsafe.Speaking to reporters at the White House, Trump addressed regional concerns following last week’s Israeli strike in Doha that targeted Hamas leaders. The attack drew sharp criticism from Qatar and other US allies in the Gulf.Asked whether Israel had given assurances not to target Qatar again, Trump said, “He [Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu] won’t be hitting Qatar.” He described the Gulf state as “a very good ally, and a lot of people don’t know that,” while adding that Israel would continue pursuing Hamas elsewhere.The president said he was troubled by reports that Hamas planned to use hostages as human shields. “I thought that was very terrible and I put out a statement,” Trump said, referring to his Truth Social post.His remarks come just days after he hosted Qatar’s Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani for dinner in New York.The Doha strike, which killed six people including a Qatari security officer, but left Hamas leaders unharmed, drew condemnation from Qatar, which denounced it as “state terrorism.”Trump also rejected an Axios report claiming Netanyahu had tipped him off about the strike in advance, giving Washington time to call it off. He insisted he only learned of the operation when it was too late to intervene.Shortly after Trump’s warning, Netanyahu expressed gratitude for US support. “Thank you President Trump for your unflinching support for Israel’s battle against Hamas and the release of all our hostages,” the Israeli prime minister said, as reported by The Times of Israel.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio arrived in Israel on Sunday morning for a two-day visit focused on the ongoing war in Gaza.Before leaving Washington, Rubio wrote on social media that his priorities included securing the release of hostages, ensuring that humanitarian aid reaches civilians and addressing the continuing threat posed by Hamas.","US President Donald Trump issued a stern warning to Hamas, saying “all bets are off” if reports are confirmed that the group has moved hostages above ground to use them as human shields.

FBI Uncovers SHOCKING DNA Proof Against Charlie Kirk Assassin Tyler Robinson; Chilling Note Exposed

DNA match, new evidence in the Charlie Kirk assassination case







Tyler Robinson has not confessed to his crime of shooting Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University to the police but he reportedly admitted it at a group chat, The Washington Post reported. “Hey guys, I have bad news for you all. It was me at UVU yesterday. im sorry for all of this,” Tyler apparently posted on Discord, the report said. The message was sent from Robinson's account to a small group of online friend Thursday night, about two hours before he was taken into custody.Discord also provided a copy of the message to authorities and told the Post that it is providing the FBI and local authorities with information about Robinson’s online activities to help their investigation.Tyler Robinson is currently being held at the Utah County Jail on special watch to determine whether he is a risk to himself or others. He is set to appear virtually for his first court appearance on Tuesday. FBI director Kash Patel made some revelations about the investigation and said FBI found a screwdriver on the rooftop from where the bullet was apparently shot and a towel in which the gun was wrapped. The DNA samples on the towel matched with Robinson, the FBI director said.""I can report today that the DNA hits from the towel that was wrapped around the firearm and the DNA on the screwdriver are positively processed for the suspect in custody,"" Patel said.Patel also confirmed that Robinson's family members collectively told the law enforcement that Robinson was influenced by left-wing ideologies.There was a chilling note before the shooting was carried out in which Robinson told someone that he had an opportunity to take out Charlie Kirk and he was going to do it. Patel said he can't speak on ideologies but the fact is that Tyler did what he did because of his hatred for what Charlie stood for.The written note was destroyed, Patel said, adding that they found forensic evidence to show what that note was.","Tyler Robinson reportedly confessed to have killed Charlie Kirk in a Discord group chat two hours before his arrest.

More Than 150,000 Evacuated in Pakistan Punjab After India’s Flood Alert

Waters recede, but threat not over

Fields and cattle lost





Even as floodwaters began to recede in parts of south Punjab, the scale of destruction remains staggering, nearly 2.5 million people have been forced to flee their homes and at least 101 lives have been lost, the Dawn reported.The Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) has called the ongoing evacuation and relief drive one of the largest in recent memory. More than 1,500 boats were deployed to rescue stranded families, with 12,427 people evacuated from villages along the Chenab, Ravi and Sutlej rivers.Multan, Muzaffargarh and Rahim Yar Khan districts bore the brunt of the floods. Entire villages were submerged — including the union council of Lati Mari in Alipur tehsil, home to 40,000 people.“Nearly 15,000 people from our basti had to leave on their own as water rose,” said Syed Kausar Shah, a local resident. “Homes and crops were destroyed, and people escaped on a hired boat. Some now live in relief camps, others under the open sky.” He added that two villagers drowned while attempting to flee.Officials declared Jalalpur Pirwala and Alipur tehsils safe after a major flood wave passed through Head Panjnad.Multan Deputy Commissioner Waseem Hamid Sindhu confirmed that 100,000 people had been evacuated from Jalalpur Pirwala alone in three days.Breaches in Shujabad and Jalalpur Pirwala are now being filled, while helicopters and drones drop food and medicine into cut-off areas. Boats continue to ferry supplies into rural belts.At a press briefing in Bahawalpur, PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said Panjnad Headworks still faced a “high flood” but levels had dropped from 700,000 cusecs earlier this week to 575,000 cusecs on Saturday. By evening, the Flood Forecasting Division reported further decline to 492,695 cusecs.“There is no threat to Jalalpur Pirwala and Alipur cities,” Kathia assured, adding that water in Bahawalpur would also recede within 24 hours. He called the scale of evacuation “historic,” stressing that Multan could have faced forced evacuations if operations were delayed.According to official data, 4,447 mouzas across 28 districts have been inundated. Alongside the mass displacement of people, more than 2.19 million cattle were rescued and shifted to higher ground.For now, the rivers appear to be calming, the Sutlej at Ganda Singh Wala was recorded at 95,000 cusecs, categorised as medium flood.

The sons of jailed former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said their father “will not be broken” by his “unlawful” imprisonment, as his legal team lodged an appeal with the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture.The elder son, Sulaiman Khan, condemned Khan's treatment in a statement attached to the appeal:Our father is being kept in conditions that no human being should endure. These are violations of his rights, and they amount to torture.”The younger son, Kasim Khan, said:The UN has already recognised that our father’s imprisonment is arbitrary and unlawful. What he is enduring now shows how far the regime will go to break him. But he will not be broken.”Sulaiman and Kasim are the cricketer-turned-politician’s sons with British filmmaker Jemima Goldsmith, with whom he was married for nine years until 2004. They live in the UK with Goldsmith.The appeal, filed by the US-based law firm Perseus Strategies on behalf of Khan’s legal team, alleged a “systematic pattern of abuse, including prolonged solitary confinement, denial of medical care, contaminated food, and restricted access to legal counsel and family visits.”His lawyers argued that these conditions breach Pakistan’s obligations under the UN Convention against Torture (CAT) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). They urged the UN to press authorities to safeguard the former PM’s physical and mental well-being.Khan has been in prison since August 2023 after being charged in multiple cases.","The sons of jailed former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said their father “will not be broken” by his “unlawful” imprisonment.

The dossier stated that its army and ISI remain involved in sustaining and reviving LeT.Senior commanders Maulana Abu Zar and Yunus Shah Bukhari are overseeing the project, due by February 2026, mirroring past cases where LeT diverted humanitarian aid, including most of the 2005 earthquake relief, to militant infrastructure.This comes amidst Pakistan's continuous assertions on global platforms that it was combating terrorism.The Indian Air Force (IAF), earlier this year, showcased the extensive damage caused to LeT Muridke headquarters during Operation Sindoor, highlighting the precision and reach of the strikes.Muridke, home to LeT’s Markaz Taiba, was identified as a critical target. The strikes hit senior leadership residential areas and office buildings where commanders convened for planning and operations.The IAF showed videos captured directly from the weapons, pointing out the level of devastation within the complex.The airstrikes reportedly killed around a dozen high-value terrorists, including Yusuf Azhar, the IC-814 hijacker, Abu Jundal (also known as Mudassar), the Muridke chief of LeT, and the son of the planner of the 2016 Nagrota attack. The operation, conducted in retaliation for the Pahalgam killings, reinforced India’s ability to carry out precise, high-impact missions inside enemy territory.The ongoing reconstruction of LeT Markaz Taiba headquarters has raised serious concerns regarding regional security, given the facility’s central role in training and radicalizing terrorists. Established in 2000, the complex serves as both a residence for senior commanders and a training ground where recruits are instructed in intelligence gathering, arms handling, and other operational skills. Analysts warn that reviving the facility could strengthen LeT’s operational capabilities and enable the recruitment of new militants.Markaz Taiba functions as the “alma mater” of LeT, providing courses that combine physical and arms training with ideological indoctrination. The center attracts recruits from within Pakistan and abroad, using religious and radicalization programs to cultivate loyalty and operational skills among future militants. Its facilities, including a mosque and guest house financed by Osama bin Laden, underscore the longstanding support the organization has received from international terror networks.The scale of the operation at Markaz Taiba further amplifies the threat. The facility reportedly trains around 1,000 students annually, preparing them for operational roles within LeT. Past evidence has shown that graduates of this center have gone on to participate in high-profile attacks, including the 26/11 Mumbai attacks, highlighting the direct link between the facility and acts of cross-border terrorism targeting India.LeT’s historical connection with Pakistan’s intelligence apparatus adds another layer of concern. Senior commanders at the facility, including those who oversaw training for the 26/11 perpetrators, have operated under the guidance of the ISI.","Pakistan is financing the reconstruction of Lashkar-e-Taiba’s (LeT) Muridke headquarters, Markaz Taiba.

A Pakistani Taliban ambush in northwest Pakistan on Saturday resulted in the deaths of at least 12 soldiers, as confirmed by local government and security officials to AFP.During a military convoy's passage through South Waziristan district at 4:00 am, ""armed men opened fire from both sides with heavy weapons"", resulting in 12 security personnel deaths and four injuries, according to a local government official.The area's security officer verified the casualties and reported that the assailants captured the convoy's weaponry.The Tehreek-e-Taliban (TTP), also known as the Pakistani Taliban, took responsibility for the attack via social media.This incident ranks among the most severe attacks in recent months within Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where the TTP previously controlled significant territories until a 2014 military operation forced their retreat.Since the Afghan Taliban's return to power in Kabul in 2021, militant activities have intensified in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border regions. Although distinct organisations, the TTP maintains close ties with the Afghan Taliban.Pakistan contends that Afghanistan fails to remove militants who use Afghan soil to attack Pakistan, whilst Kabul authorities reject these claims.Local residents across various Khyber Pakhtunkhwa districts have recently reported TTP-branded graffiti appearing on buildings, expressing concerns about a potential return to the group's previous control during the height of the US ""War on Terror"".A high-ranking local government official recently informed AFP about increased TTP fighter presence and attack frequency.Since January 1, approximately 460 individuals, predominantly security forces personnel, have lost their lives in attacks by anti-state armed groups in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan provinces, according to AFP's records.Pakistan experienced its most lethal period in nearly ten years during the previous year, with over 1,600 fatalities, including almost half being soldiers and police officers, as reported by the Islamabad-based Center for Research and Security Studies.","Pakistani Taliban ambush in northwest Pakistan kills at least 12 soldiers.

Poll Is it ethical for governments to use technology from foreign countries for surveillance? Yes, if it protects citizens No, it compromises sovereignty





Pakistan — with the help of Chinese technology — is spying on millions of its citizens to curb dissent and free speech, an Amnesty International report said.According to the report, Pakistan is using a Chinese-built internet firewall that censors social media, enabling spy agencies to monitor at least 4 million mobile phones at a time through its Lawful Intercept Management System (LIMS). The firewall, known as WMS 2.0, inspects internet traffic and can block 2 million active sessions at once.The human rights watchdog said it reviewed licensing agreements, trade data, leaked technical files, and Chinese records linking the firewall supplier to state-owned firms in Beijing.Amnesty said the firewall uses equipment from US-based Niagara Networks, software from Thales DIS — a unit of France's Thales — and servers from a Chinese state IT firm. An earlier version relied on Canada’s Sandvine.""The two monitoring systems function in tandem: one lets intelligence agencies tap calls and texts, while the other slows or blocks websites and social media across the country,"" the report said.""Mass surveillance creates a chilling effect in society, whereby people are deterred from exercising their rights, both online and offline,"" it added.The report further said that Pakistan is currently blocking about 650,000 web links and restricting access to platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, and X.It also accused agencies of spying on at least 4 million mobile phones at a time through LIMS, while WMS 2.0 can block 2 million active sessions at once, Amnesty said.Amnesty noted that its findings draw on a 2024 Islamabad High Court case filed by Bushra Bibi, the wife of former Prime Minister Imran Khan, after her private calls were leaked online.In court, Pakistan's defense ministries and intelligence agencies denied running or even having the capacity for phone tapping. However, under questioning, the telecom regulator admitted it had already ordered phone companies to install LIMS for use by ""designated agencies.""Crackdowns have tightened in recent years, particularly after the military broke with then Prime Minister Imran Khan in 2022. Khan was later jailed, and thousands of his party activists were detained.","Amnesty International: Pakistan using Chinese-built internet firewall that censors social media.

Aleema Khan, sister of Pakistan 's jailed former prime minister Imran Khan , was attacked with an egg while addressing reporters outside Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail on Friday.A video of the episode has gone viral on social media, showing the egg hitting Aleema as she spoke to the media.Supporters of Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party quickly apprehended two women accused of throwing the eggs and handed them over to police, news agency PTI reported.Rawalpindi police said the arrested women were PTI party supporters who had travelled with members of the All-Government Employees Grand Alliance to protest against unmet demands.The statement added that the egg was thrown after Aleema did not respond to questions from the two women. Both were later taken into custody and moved to the Adiala checkpoint.PTI condemned the act as “shameful,” alleging the women were planted for political motives and accusing police of helping them escape in a car. “The women were sent to Aleema's media talk as part of an agenda,” the party said.Leaders across the political spectrum criticized the attack.Balochistan National Party-Mengal chief Akhtar Mengal condemned the act, calling it “the lowest form of politics.”He said, “Even in enmity, a woman deserves dignity. Targeting women is the lowest form of politics, and this cheap stunt must be condemned in the strongest words.”Federal minister for development Ahsan Iqbal said, “Politics must remain a contest of ideas, not of violence or hatred.

A relatively unknown militant group, Ittihad-ul-Mujahideen (IuM) Pakistan, has claimed responsibility for the suicide car bomb attack on the Federal Constabulary Corps in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Bannu division on Tuesday.The outfit claimed the attack, which involved a car rigged with IED, killed more than two dozen members of the Frontier Corps but Pakistan acknowledged only six fatalities. Predictably, it blamed India for the attack. Pakistan claimed to have neutralised five operatives in a 12-hour counter operation but the group asserted that its 'fidayeen' blew themselves up after carrying out the attack. One of the suicide bombers was identified by the group as Abdul Aziz alias Qassid Mohajir, a resident of Afghanistan's Paktika province.The Pakistan army camp suffered massive destruction in the suicide attack. Pakistan military's ISPR played down the incident, the latest in a series of attacks on Pakistani military personnel. ""During early hours of Sept 2, Indian proxy 'Fitna al Khwarij' targeted the Federal Constabulary Headquarters in Bannu district. The Indian-sponsored Kharjis attempted to breach the perimeter security, however, their nefarious designs were swiftly foiled by vigilant and resolute response.In their desperation, the Kahrjis rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into the perimeter wall. The suicide blast resulted in the partial collapse of the perimeter wall and damage to adjacent civilian infrastructure, inflicting injuries to three innocent civilians,"" ISPR said.IuM Pakistan, active since April, comprises fighters from outfits like Hafiz Gul Bahadur Group, Lashkar-e-Islam and Jamaat-Ul-Ahrar. In the last few months, it has claimed multiple attacks in areas like North Waziristan, Miranshah and Tirah Valley. Its strikes included sniper, rocket launcher and grenade attacks, and ambushes on convoys, besides drone strikes. Its formation had attracted criticism from groups like Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan which termed itself as the most structured and legitimate jihadi group in Pakistan.","Ittihad-ul-Mujahideen (IuM) Pakistan has claimed responsibility for the suicide car bomb attack on the Federal Constabulary Corps in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Bannu division on Tuesday.

‘Azerbaijan Cheers Pak’s 'Win Over India’; Turkey Backs Sharif; New ‘Anti-India Bloc’ Takes Shape?





Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev has accused India of blocking Azerbaijan's bid for full membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO).Aliyev said that the reported blockade from New Delhi came as a response to Azerbaijan’s support for Pakistan during the clashes between India and Pakistan in May.Emphasising brotherly ties between Azerbaijan and Pakistan, Aliyev ""noted that, in response to Azerbaijan’s support, India has attempted to retaliate against Azerbaijan in international organizations, but stressed that this holds no significance for Azerbaijan, as brotherly relations take precedence above all.""Earlier, local media reports claimed that New Delhi blocked Azerbaijan’s bid for full SCO membership.Meanwhile, Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Muhammad Ishaq Dar spoke by phone with his Armenian counterpart, Ararat Mirzoyan, earlier this week, during which the two agreed to explore the possibility of establishing diplomatic relations.Dar confirmed the conversation on his official X account. Pakistan had earlier suspended ties with Armenia following its occupation of Azerbaijani territories and consistently regarded Armenia as an aggressor, while also supporting UN Security Council resolutions affirming Azerbaijan’s territorial integrity.On the sidelines of the SCO meet, Aliyev also met with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. The leaders vowed continued growth of bilateral relations, emphasizing their ""brotherly ties"" and strategic partnership across sectors, including energy and transport.India’s trade and tourism ties with Turkey and Azerbaijan remain strained after both countries expressed support for Pakistan and criticised India’s recent strikes on terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.Their stance has triggered nationwide calls in India to boycott goods from Turkey and Azerbaijan and to avoid travel to these countries.",Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev has accused India of blocking Azerbaijan's bid for full membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.

"From Mandarin in menus to shop signs in Thamel, Chinese influence rising in Nepal",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/from-mandarin-in-menus-to-shop-signs-in-thamel-chinese-influence-rising-in-nepal/articleshow/123908602.cms,"Showroom of a Chinese EV company in Kathmandu.





KATHMANDU: On a stroll through Kathmandu’s Thamel district—the beating heart of Nepal’s tourist trade—the presence of China is hard to miss. Shop signs flash Mandarin translations, and even restaurant menus have dish details elaborated in the language. In narrow lanes once dominated almost entirely by Indian backpackers and European trekkers, Chinese tourists now form a noticeable second wave.At Tribhuvan International Airport, the shift has been made official. Alongside a long-standing immigration counter reserved for Indian citizens, a new one has been set up for Chinese travellers, with colourful words saying: 'Celebrating 70 years of Nepal-China friendship'. The gesture complements an existing visa-free regime for Chinese citizens, making their entry smoother than ever in the Himalayan nation.For Mausam Rana, a hotel manager in Thamel, the impact is visible in the guest ledger. “Indians still form the bulk of our clientele,” he said. “But Chinese numbers are rising. Till some time back, our hotel used to have around 15 or 20 Chinese tourists in a month—now it’s double that.With campaigns like 'Visit Nepal' this year and better flight connections, the peak season could bring even more.”Official data seems to confirm what the eye sees. In August, Nepal welcomed 88,680 foreign visitors, a 22 % rise from last year. Indians accounted for 40 %, Chinese 8.5 %, and Americans about 6 %. Himal Gautam, director at department of tourism, Nepal, told TOI, ""In August, a total of 7,533 Chinese tourists visited Nepal in comparison to 6,614 in the same month last year. SImilarly, in May, a total of 8,824 tourists from China visited our country against 8,381 in May last year.Indian tourists have always topped the chart in terms of foreign tourists visiting our country. But we are happy that more tourists are also coming from China and other countries as well.""The new relationship extends beyond tourism. Chinese automakers—BYD, Leap Motors, Omoda, XPENG, Dongfeng Forthing, Great Wall, to name a few, have flooded Kathmandu’s streets with sleek electric vehicles. Taxi driver Sushil Thapa, who has worked the roads for two decades, says Indian cars once ruled. “Now, whole fleets run on Chinese EVs. They’re stylish, affordable, and packed with features.”For Kathmandu-based analysts like Kanchan Jha, the trend is unmistakable. “It reflects a look-beyond-India mindset,” he said. “Our ties with India remain deep, but there is value in cultivating another giant across the mountains.”","In August, Nepal welcomed 88,680 foreign visitors, a 22 % rise from last year.

Nepal will observe a nationwide day of mourning on September 17 to honor the victims of last week’s violent anti-government protests, which forced KP Sharma Oli to resign and saw Sushila Karki sworn in as interim prime minister.The demonstrations, led by Gen Z activists against corruption and a social media ban, left at least 59 protesters, 10 prisoners, and three policemen dead.Public offices will remain closed, and the national flag will be flown at half-mast, home minister Om Prakash Aryal announced, as cited by PTI.Aryal further announced that the government will build a Gen Z Awareness Park to commemorate those who lost their lives.He also announced that each bereaved family will receive Nepali Rs 1 million in compensation, along with an additional Nepali Rs 500,000 to cover other expenses. In total, the government will provide Nepali Rs 1.5 million to the families of those killed during the protests.The funds are to be distributed through the respective District Administration Offices.After taking charge, Nepal’s new Prime Minister, Sushila Karki, declared those killed in the September 8–9 protests as “martyrs.”She urged citizens to unite with a “positive mindset” to help rebuild the economy, while emphasizing that the interim government would function strictly within its six-month mandate.Nepal's government has also decided to probe all incidents from the protests, with a Cabinet meeting on Monday approving the formation of a high-level judicial inquiry commission to lead the investigation.The unrest, which began as protests over a brief social media ban on September 7, quickly escalated into a broader uprising against corruption, nepotism, and entrenched political elites.Demonstrators set fire to government buildings, politicians’ homes, and even the parliament, while soldiers remain deployed across Kathmandu to maintain order.The situation appears to have eased, with citizens assuring on social media that Nepal is “completely safe for travellers” and returning to normal. Youth clarified the protests were “only against the government and not tourists.”","Nepal will observe a nationwide day of mourning on September 17 to honor the victims of last week’s violent anti-government protests.

KATHMANDU: As Nepal struggles to recover from the Sept 8–9 protests that left at least 72 people dead and the country grappling with a trail of destruction, police personnel involved in controlling the surging crowds that took to the streets, say they were caught in a Catch-22 situation.“Nobody bothered to know what we went through. We became villains in the eyes of the public just because we followed govt orders. If we hadn’t obeyed, we would have faced consequences. If we did, we had to risk our lives controlling the volatile crowds. Either way, we were doomed. Sadly, nobody saw our situation,” said a police officer deployed at Durbar Marg, which was slowly returning to normalcy on Sunday.Among the dead were three Nepal police officers too. An assistant head constable stationed near the charred remains of Singha Durbar, said the silence over the deaths of the police personnel was ""deeply painful"". “Everyone talks about the protesters. But we, too, are humans with families. Our colleagues, who were sole breadwinners for their families, were brutally thrashed and killed on the streets. The trauma their family members are enduring is unimaginable. ”Cops say the least the new govt can do is give jobs to dependents of those killed. “The most eligible family member should be allowed to replace them in the force,” a senior sub-inspector said. “And those responsible for killing the three personnel must be brought to justice, just as there is demand for action against those who killed protesters. Justice must be even and equal for all.”","Cops say the least the new govt can do is give jobs to dependents of those killed. ‘The most eligible family member should be allowed to replace them in the force,’ a senior sub-inspector said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123891000,imgsize-1429681,width-400,resizemode-4/police-launched-crackdown-on-dissenters-during-the-protest-file-agencies.jpg"

Experts Hail ‘Nepal’s Step Towards Democracy’, Praise Sushila Karki’s Six-Month Deadline For Power





As Nepal picks up its pieces following the violent protests that left many of the country's iconic buildings as well as hundreds of govt offices and homes badly damaged, an unusual economy is stirring amidst the rubble. Scrap dealers in Kathmandu are bracing for a windfall, as heaps of building material, metal and junk is cleared from vandalised govt complexes, burnt-down car showrooms, and ransacked supermarkets.""The junk largely comprises charred cars, damaged furniture and other metal scrap from torched public buildings,"" an official of the Kathmandu Metropolitan City administration said. ""It will eventually be auctioned to scrap dealers through tenders once cleanup is complete,"" he added.Among the areas that were ravaged in the Sept 8-9 'Gen Z' protests that led to downfall of the KP Sharma Oli government were the historic Singha Durbar, the Supreme Court, office of the attorney general, and the parliament building in Kathmandu. Besides, scores of govt offices in around 250 municipalities were damaged due to vandalism and arson, a spokesperson at the ministry of federal affairs and general administration was quoted as saying by The Kathmandu Post.Biratnagar’s four-storey municipal building was reduced to rubble, while two ward offices were burned. Birgunj saw three of its seven buildings rendered unusable, and 95 per cent of municipal properties destroyed, the newspaper reported.“What happened to the properties was very unfortunate. They should not have been damaged. But then somebody has to now take care of disposal of the mess. Scrap dealers will do that,” said Paban Tamling, a local scrap merchant. He added that business could triple or even quadruple.“Before the protest, the annual business of scrap dealing in Kathmandu was around 2 crore Nepalese rupees. But now, after the vandalism and arson, it would easily cross over 5 crore,” Tamling added.Deepak Jaiswal, who runs the recycling firm 'Thalo Kawadi', echoed the sentiment. “We are waiting for officials to finish assessing the damage and then float tenders. The number of bidders this time will surely increase, as many will try to jump into the business. It sounds odd after such tragic events, but it’s the harsh truth—someone’s loss is another’s business.”","Scrap dealers in Kathmandu are bracing for a windfall as heaps of building material, metal and junk is cleared from vandalised govt complexes, burnt-down car showrooms, and ransacked supermarkets.

DHAKA: Bangladesh Islamist party Jamaat-e-Islami's student wing swept the central students union election at the Jahangirnagar University (JU) on Saturday, less than week after its win at the Dhaka University. The Islami Chhatra Shibir (ICS) won 20 out of 25 positions in the JU Central Students' Union (JUCSU) election, even though it was virtually inactive for nearly 35 years on the JU campus. Of the positions ICS did not win, was the top post of vice president. Abdur Rashid Zitu, who contested from a newly formed group called Swatantra Shikkharthi Sammilon, will hold the post of VP.Former PM Khaleda Zia BNP backed Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal panel did not win any post. Student union polls are slated in two other major Bangladesh universities - at Rajshahi University on Sept 25 and Chattogram University on Oct 12. The outcomes of university polls could have far-reaching implications as campus politics has often influenced country's political landscape.","Islami Chhatra Shibir (ICS) won 20 out of 25 positions in the JU Central Students' Union (JUCSU) election.

Nepal police have re-arrested over 3,700 inmates who escaped during last week’s violent anti-government protests, officials said on Sunday.Deputy Inspector General Binod Ghimire, spokesperson for Nepal Police, reported that 3,723 prisoners have been returned to jail, while 10,320 remain at large, urging the public to remain alert.More than 13,500 inmates escaped from prisons across Nepal within 24 hours of the Gen Z protest movement, triggering the country’s worst internal security crisis in decades. The mass jailbreak has also raised concerns in India, where some fugitives are wanted or linked to criminal networks along the Bihar and Uttar Pradesh border.While a handful of escapees have reportedly promised to return once unrest subsides, most remain untraceable. The crisis has been further complicated by the burning of court records in arson attacks, hampering follow-up action by authorities.A joint campaign by the Nepali Army, Nepal Police, and Armed Police Force is underway to track down and arrest the escaped prisoners, DIG Binod Ghimire said, as cited by PTI.Among the escapees are some of Nepal’s most notorious convicts and politically sensitive detainees. They include former junior minister Sanjay ‘Takla’ Sah, convicted for the 2012 Janakpur bomb blast and the 2007 murder of industrialist Arun Kumar Singhania.Others are kidnapper Uday Shetti, known for cross-border operations in the Raxaul-Sitamarhi corridor, suspended deputy prime minister Top Bahadur Rayamajhi, on trial in the fake Bhutanese refugee scam, and former home secretary Tek Narayan Pandey. Singhania’s killing drew outrage in Bihar and Jharkhand, where his family remains active in business and media.","More than 13,500 inmates escaped from prisons across Nepal within 24 hours of the Gen Z protest movement.

Sushila Karki Sworn In as Nepal’s Interim Prime Minister

Poll Do you believe Sushila Karki's government will effectively restore stability in Nepal? Yes, definitely No, not at all





As she took charge of Nepal's interim prime minister on Sunday, Sushila Karki’s first act was to define the limits of her own power. Taking charge at Singha Durbar on Sunday, the former Chief Justice made clear that her government is only a bridge to elections.In the same breath, she located the moral core of her authority in the Gen Z protests of September 8, declaring those killed as ""martyrs"" and promising their families state compensation. By doing so, Karki framed her government not as a continuation of discredited politics, but as an answer to the demand for justice that brought her to power.Sushila Karki, former Chief Justice of Nepal, became the country’s first woman to hold the post of prime minister when she assumed office at Singha Durbar on Sunday, days after violent protests across the country.After taking charge, Karki addressed the media and said her government’s role is limited to ensuring stability, justice, and preparing for elections within six months.She inherits an office vacated by KP Sharma Oli after days of violent protests left 72 people dead. These protests, led largely by young Nepalis, were sparked by the government’s social media ban but quickly turned into a movement demanding accountability, economic reform, and an end to corruption.""I and my team are not here to taste the power. We won't stay for more than six months. We will hand over the responsibility to the new parliament. We won't succeed without your support,"" she said at a press conference.She recognised the September 8 youth-led protest and announced that those who died will be honoured as martyrs. She also declared that their families would receive compensation of NRs one million each.""27 hours of movement is first in Nepal. They are demanding economic equality and the eradication of corruption. All the deceased of September 8 are announced martyrs and will be given one million each. Expenses of the injured will be borne by the government, and they will also be compensated,"" she said.According to The Himalayan Times, 72 people have died in the protests so far — 59 demonstrators, 10 prison inmates, and three police officers.Karki said the government would help in sending the bodies of the deceased to their home districts. She also said that those who suffered damage to personal property will be supported by the state. Reconstruction and economic recovery will be a priority. ""We are in an economic crisis. We should discuss and work on the reconstruction,"" she added.Karki, who earlier served as Nepal’s first female Chief Justice, has taken over with the backing of the Gen Z-led protest movement.The September 8 demonstrations, led mainly by young activists, were triggered by anger over corruption, lack of accountability, and the government’s decision to ban social media.The 73-year-old was sworn in as interim Prime Minister on Friday. Protesters had endorsed her name, citing her independence and integrity, after Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli resigned following the unrest.","Sushila Karki, former Chief Justice of Nepal, became the country’s first woman to hold the post of prime minister when she assumed office on Sunday.

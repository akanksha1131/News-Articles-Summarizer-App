The United States, South Korea, and Japan on Monday began a joint air and naval exercise off South Korea’s Jeju Island, in what they called their most advanced trilateral military drill to date. The exercise, named Freedom Edge, will run through Friday and is aimed at boosting cooperation across air, sea and cyber domains in response to North Korea’s growing nuclear and missile threats, South Korea’s defence ministry said, reported news agency AP.According to the US Indo-Pacific command, Freedom Edge includes ballistic missile defence, air-defence drills, medical evacuations, and maritime operations training. It will also involve aerial assets from the US marine corps and Air Force. The command described it as “the most advanced demonstration of trilateral defense cooperation to date.”The drills have drawn a strong response from North Korea, which has historically condemned joint military exercises by its regional rivals. In a statement carried by state media, Kim Yo Jong, sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, said:“The reckless show of strength made by them in real action in the vicinity of the DPRK, which is the wrong place, will inevitably bring bad results to themselves,” as quoted by the agency.She also criticised the Iron Mace tabletop exercise held recently by the US and South Korea, which reportedly focuses on integrating US nuclear capabilities with South Korean conventional forces to deter North Korean threats. The two militaries have not officially confirmed details of that drill, which was reported to coincide with Freedom Edge.North Korea has previously responded to such exercises with missile launches or other military demonstrations. Talks between Pyongyang, Seoul and Washington aimed at curbing the North’s weapons programme remain stalled.Kim Jong Un has instead moved closer to Russia and China, both of which have increased defence and diplomatic engagement with North Korea in recent months. Since the start of the Ukraine war, Kim has sent large quantities of artillery shells and ballistic missiles to Russia, according to Western intelligence claims.He also visited China earlier this month and appeared alongside President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin at a large-scale military parade.","The exercise, named Freedom Edge, will run through Friday.

Charlie Kirk assassination: Shooter Tyler Robinson once bragged about long-range shooting skills; claimed 450-yard hit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/charlie-kirk-assassination-shooter-tyler-robinson-once-bragged-about-long-range-shooting-skills-claimed-450-yard-hit/articleshow/123877582.cms,"Charlie Kirk Assassin’s Motive: FBI Uncovers Tyler Robinson’s Hateful Motive Behind Killing Kirk

‘He said he made a 450-yard shot’



Work history under review







Tyler Robinson, the man accused of assassinating right-wing activist Charlie Kirk, once bragged about his long-range shooting skills, according to a former coworker.The 22-year-old Robinson has been arrested without bail for allegedly killing Kirk during a speech at Utah Valley University on Wednesday. The accused previously worked as a first-year electrician on a new apartment complex in St George in 2023. A fellow electrician, who requested anonymity, told The Post on Saturday that Robinson rarely spoke on the job, unless the subject turned to firearms.“Right after Black Friday, I had just got done working and I was showing my supervisor the new pistol I bought,” the coworker said. “We were out by the trucks, and then Tyler and another guy came over and we were all talking about what kinds of guns we were gonna get or had bought, and they started talking about their longest shots. Tyler said he made a 450-yard shot.”The coworker described Robinson as distant and expressionless, but visibly more animated during that exchange. “That was like the only time we got him to conversate with us. He got excited about it — at least, as excited as he can get. He never really showed much emotion. He was just kind of, I don’t know, blank? He was just really quiet,” he told The Post.He also remembered that Robinson used to run from discussing politics.“I remember one time we were talking about [politics] in one of the units, and instead of sitting in the room with us, Tyler went into the back laundry room and sat on a bucket and I think put an earbud in,” Robinson's former coworker noted.Robinson was employed by Washington County–based High Output Electric at the time, contracted through Wilde Electric for the apartment wiring project, the coworker said.Shane Bennett, the owner of High Output Electric, confirmed Robinson worked there until late 2023 but said he could not recall whether Robinson quit or was dismissed.Robinson faces expected charges in connection with the fatal shooting of Kirk, a 31-year-old married father of two and founder of Turning Point USA. Authorities say Kirk was struck by a single bullet fired from a rooftop about 200 yards away during his address on campus.","Tyler Robinson, 22, is accused of killing right-wing activist Charlie Kirk on Wednesday.

What is Valhalla?

Valhalla comes from Old Norse religion, followed by Vikings and other Germanic peoples before Christianity spread in Scandinavia.

spread in Scandinavia. It is called the “Hall of the Slain” and is ruled by the god Odin in Asgard.

According to Norse belief, only warriors who die bravely in battle are chosen by Odin to enter Valhalla.

Those in Valhalla are believed to feast and prepare for the final battle, Ragnarök.





FBI director Kash Patel came under fire on Friday after his tribute to Charlie Kirk at a press conference where the agency revealed the shooter’s identity.Patel said, “To my friend Charlie Kirk. Rest now brother. We have the watch and I’ll see you in Valhalla.”The comment sparked social media backlash. Patel was already facing criticism after the FBI initially arrested the wrong person in Kirk’s shooting, only to release him later when they realised the mistake. Critics said the Valhalla reference was inappropriate, given Kirk was a Christian and Patel was raised Hindu.Online, users questioned the choice of words. One wrote, “Indian guy saying he’ll see a Christian in Valhalla is some confused theology.” Another said, “We don’t believe in Valhalla. This is so not the time or place to be cute.”","FBI director Kash Patel came under fire on Friday after his tribute to Charlie Kirk.

Key visibility details include:

New Zealand: Some of the most prominent views will occur here, particularly in southern cities like Dunedin, where up to 72% of the Sun is expected to be obscured.

Eastern Australia: Areas on the eastern coastline will also get a sunrise view of the eclipse.

South Pacific Islands: Several island regions across the South Pacific will witness partial coverage during early daylight hours.

Antarctica: Observers in some Antarctic locations could experience extensive eclipse coverage, likely among the most dramatic views.

Understanding solar eclipses – Types and what to expect

Total solar eclipse



The Moon completely covers the Sun.

Observers in a narrow zone experience brief daylight darkness.

Spectacular but rare. Partial solar eclipse



Only part of the Sun is covered by the Moon.

Creates a crescent or “bitten” appearance of the Sun.

This is the type occurring on September 21, 2025. Annular solar eclipse



The Moon is farther from Earth and doesn’t fully cover the Sun.

A ring of sunlight remains visible, forming the “ring of fire” effect.





In an extraordinary celestial turn, September 2025 is bookended by two eclipses, a lunar eclipse on the 7th and a solar eclipse just 15 days later. While the Moon recently turned a vivid red in a dramatic lunar display, the sky will offer another rare phenomenon: a partial solar eclipse on September 21, timed just before the equinox. However, this spectacle won’t be visible everywhere, and the UAE is among the regions that will miss it.The final solar eclipse of 2025 is scheduled for September 21. Unlike a total eclipse, this will be a partial solar eclipse, where the Moon covers only part of the Sun, creating a crescent-shaped sliver of sunlight. Even as a partial eclipse, it provides a rare chance to observe the Sun’s changing face.This event holds additional significance because it closely precedes the September equinox, which falls on September 22, 2025. The equinox is one of two moments in the year when the Sun is directly above the Earth’s equator, resulting in nearly equal day and night lengths across the globe. Because of this timing, the eclipse is also being called an ""equinox eclipse"", adding to its astronomical and symbolic intrigue.The event also carries cultural and astrological meaning. This year's Pitru Paksha — a fortnight in the Hindu calendar dedicated to ancestral remembrance and rituals — uniquely begins with a lunar eclipse and ends with this solar eclipse, a rare alignment astrologers consider especially potent.This celestial pairing not only marks an important astronomical event but also deepens the spiritual significance of Pitru Paksha for many observers.Also Read: Saudi National Day 2025 The September 21 partial solar eclipse will be visible only in specific parts of the Southern Hemisphere, offering clear views to skywatchers in select regions.Skywatchers in visible regions must use proper solar filters or eclipse glasses to view the partial eclipse safely.Unlike the lunar eclipse on September 7, which had wide visibility across many countries, this solar eclipse will not be visible in the UAE or most parts of the Northern Hemisphere.Countries that will not witness any part of the eclipse include:This means millions of skywatchers across Asia and the Americas will miss the event entirely — a sharp contrast to the global excitement generated by the earlier lunar eclipse.A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon moves between the Earth and the Sun, partially or fully blocking sunlight in specific areas on Earth. These alignments don’t happen frequently in the same place due to the precise positioning required.There are three main types of solar eclipses:Although this particular eclipse is not a total one, its timing, rarity, and symbolic links to the equinox and Pitru Paksha make it a notable event in the 2025 celestial calendar.This will be the last solar eclipse of 2025, concluding a year that featured two solar eclipses","The final solar eclipse of 2025 is scheduled for September 21.

US President Donald Trump on Sunday struck an ambiguous note on the future of TikTok, suggesting that China would ultimately decide the app’s fate just days ahead of a September 17 deadline for its parent company ByteDance to sell its US assets or face a ban.“We may let it die, or we may, I don’t know — it depends, up to China,” Trump told reporters in New Jersey before returning to Washington.Trump has already pushed back the TikTok deadline three times since January. While lawmakers warn that the app poses national security risks, he has also credited it with helping him connect with younger voters during last year’s election.Last month, US President said that he had US buyers lined up for the app and signaled he could extend the deadline again. On Sunday, however, he sounded less certain. “It doesn’t matter too much. I’d like to do it for the kids. They like it,” he said.The president also pointed to TikTok’s role in his campaign outreach. “I did very well on TikTok, and I got the youth vote and I got numbers that nobody’s ever even come close to in the Republican Party,” he said.“Some was attributed to TikTok, and a lot was attributed to Charlie,” he added, referring to conservative activist Charlie Kirk who was assassinated on September 10 while speaking at Utah Valley University.Sources suggest that the administration is likely to grant another extension rather than force a shutdown this week. Such a move would give more time for negotiations but could frustrate lawmakers in Congress who have pressed for a clear decision on the platform, as reported by news agency Reuters.Meanwhile, American and Chinese officials held talks in Madrid on Sunday, where TikTok was part of a broader trade agenda. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer met Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng and top negotiator Li Chenggang.TikTok had not featured in earlier rounds of trade discussions in Geneva, London and Stockholm. Since beginning his second term in January, Trump has chosen not to enforce the law requiring TikTok’s US assets to be sold or shut down. Instead, he has pushed back the deadline three times, first to April, then to June and most recently to September.With the deadline approaching, a final agreement is unlikely, leaving the platform’s future uncertain.",TikTok's parent company ByteDance has until September 17 to sell its US assets or face a ban.

Arrest followed family intervention



Governor: Suspect not cooperating







Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old accused of assassinating conservative activist Charlie Kirk during a campus event last week, is being held under “special watch” as officials carry out a mental health evaluation, authorities said Sunday.Robinson, who was taken into custody after a 33-hour manhunt, will remain in the Utah County sheriff’s department’s special housing unit “so that authorities can keep a close eye on him” until the evaluation is complete, the department said in a statement. The process could take several days.Once cleared, Robinson will move into the jail’s standard classification process to determine his permanent housing. “He will continue to be monitored by mental, medical, and custody staff throughout the duration of his stay,” the department added.Officials noted that “special watch” status is commonly applied for several reasons, including the nature of the crime, violent or erratic behaviour, and suicidal threats made during or after arrest. Authorities confirmed they were specifically alerted to suicidal comments or concerns regarding Robinson.Robinson allegedly opened fire on Kirk, 31, during a Turning Point USA event on Wednesday at Utah Valley University, killing the married father of two young children in front of an audience.The suspect’s arrest came after his father recognised him in FBI surveillance footage released during the manhunt. According to a law enforcement source cited by Fox News Digital, Robinson returned to his father’s home and said he wanted to kill himself. His father later consulted a minister before turning him in to the authorities.Utah governor Brian Cox said Sunday that Robinson has so far refused to cooperate with investigators.“He has not confessed to authorities. He is not cooperating, but all the people around him are cooperating. And I think that’s very important,” Cox told ABC News.The governor added that Robinson’s family members and his romantic partner, a man transitioning from male to female, are assisting investigators. He also noted that those close to the 22-year-old described him as being “deeply indoctrinated with leftist ideology.”","Tyler Robinson, 22, is being held under “special watch” as officials carry out a mental health evaluation, authorities said Sunday.

Former Illinois Governor Jim Edgar, a two-term Republican credited with guiding the state toward greater financial stability in the 1990s, died Sunday at the age of 79.Edgar passed away from complications related to his treatment for pancreatic cancer, which he publicly disclosed earlier this year.“We are deeply grateful for the love, support and kindness so many have shown to Jim and our family over these last several months,” his family said in a statement.Born in small-town Oklahoma, Edgar began his political career as a state legislator and later served as Illinois secretary of state for a decade. He was elected governor in 1990, a moderate Republican who easily won reelection, including in heavily Democratic Cook County, home to Chicago.At the time Edgar took office, Illinois faced hundreds of millions in debt and was paying bills months late. Amid a recession, he pushed legislators to cut the state budget, including layoffs and reductions in popular programs. He also fulfilled a campaign promise by making a temporary income tax surcharge permanent, providing a stable source of funding for public schools, reported AP.Edgar remained active as a party statesman and adviser, though he grew uneasy with the Republican Party’s shift to the right.He was among high-profile Republicans who did not support Donald Trump’s presidency, joining a campaign supporting Kamala Harris’s 2020 presidential bid called “Republicans for Harris.”In 1997, Edgar surprised many by announcing he would not seek a third term, despite his popularity. Republicans tried to draft him for other offices, including the US senate and another gubernatorial bid, but he declined.After leaving office, Edgar continued teaching and served as president emeritus of the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library Foundation, among other roles.Illinois governer JB Pritzker announced that state flags would fly at half-staff in Edgar’s honor.“Now more than ever, we should channel that spirit and resolve to live as Governor Edgar did: with honesty, integrity, and an enduring respect for all,” Pritzker said, as quoted by AP. “He will live on in the incalculable number of lives he touched and in the stronger institutions he helped build.”Edgar’s relatives said details on funeral plans would be announced in the coming days.","Jim Edgar, a two-term Republican governor of Illinois, died Sunday at the age of 79. Edgar passed away from complications related to his treatment for pancreatic cancer, which he publicly disclosed earlier this year.

Unseen Video Of Charlie Kirk's Killing; How ‘Assassin’ Tyler Went From ‘Diehard Trump’ To ‘Hater’





Two men were arrested Friday after an incendiary device was discovered under a news media vehicle in Salt Lake City, Utah.The bomb, which “had been lit but failed to function as designed,” did not go off, according to court records cited by CBS affiliate KUTV.Police and fire department bomb squads responded when the suspicious device was found near an occupied building. The FBI later identified two suspects and executed a search warrant at a home in the Magna neighborhood, west of downtown.During the search, neighboring homes were evacuated. Investigators recovered explosives, “explosive-related components,” firearms, illegal narcotics and other paraphernalia. Court records also noted the discovery of at least two hoax weapons of mass destruction.A 58-year-old man and a 31-year-old man were taken into custody and could face charges tied to weapons possession and threats of terrorism, ABC affiliate KTVX reported Sunday, as quoted by AP.Authorities have not released information on a possible motive, and the relationship between the suspects is not yet known.The incident comes as Salt Lake City drew national media attention following last week’s assassination of Turning Point USA co-founder Charlie Kirk.","Two men were arrested Friday after an incendiary device was discovered under a news media vehicle in Salt Lake City, Utah.

President Donald Trump on Sunday urged foreign companies to expand investment in the United States and bring in expert personnel to train American workers in advanced manufacturing.In a post on Truth Social, Trump stressed the need for the country to relearn skills in industries such as semiconductors, shipbuilding, and high-tech machinery by learning directly from foreign firms making large-scale investments.""When Foreign Companies who are building extremely complex products, machines, and various other 'things,' come into the United States with massive Investments, I want them to bring their people of expertise for a period of time to teach and train our people how to make these very unique and complex products, as they phase out of our Country, and back into their land,"" Trump said.He argued that such knowledge transfer is critical to restoring American industrial strength and ensuring lasting benefits from foreign investment. ""If we didn't do this, all of that massive Investment will never come in the first place -- Chips, Semiconductors, Computers, Ships, Trains, and so many other products that we have to learn from others how to make, or, in many cases, relearn, because we used to be great at it, but not anymore,"" he added.""We welcome them, we welcome their employees, and we are willing to proudly say we will learn from them, and do even better than them at their own “game,” sometime into the not too distant future!"" said Trump.Trump's post comes a week after he warned foreign countries investing in America to abide by immigration laws after around 475 illegal workers were arrested after federal immigration authorities raided the Hyundai plant in Georgia.

Washington: Hours after the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, FBI Director Kash Patel declared online that ""the subject"" in the killing was in custody. The shooter was not. The two men who had been detained were quickly released. Utah officials acknowledged that the gunman remained at large.The false assurance was more than a slip. It spotlighted the high-stakes uncertainty surrounding Patel's leadership of the bureau when its credibility is under extraordinary pressure, as is his own.Patel now approaches congressional oversight hearings this week facing not just questions about that investigation but broader doubts about whether he can stabilise a federal law enforcement agency fragmented by political fights and internal upheaval.Democrats are poised to press Patel on a purge of senior executives that has prompted a lawsuit, his pursuit of President Donald Trump's grievances long after the Russia investigation ended, and a realignment of resources that has prioritised the fight against immigration and street crime.The hearings will offer Patel his most consequential stage yet, and perhaps the clearest test of whether he can convince the country that the FBI, under his watch, can avoid compounding its mistakes in a time of political violence. ""Because of the skepticism that some members of the Senate have had and still have, it's extremely important that he perform very well at these oversight hearings,"" Gregory Brower, the FBI's former top congressional affairs official, said.

NEW YORK: In the days following the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, numerous workers have been fired for their comments on his death, among them MSNBC political analyst Matthew Dowd.It's far from the first time workers have lost their jobs over things they say publicly - including in social media posts. In the US, laws can vary across states, but overall, there's very little legal protections for employees who are punished for speech made both in and out of private workplaces.""Most people think they have a right to free speech...but that doesn't necessarily apply in the workplace,"" said Vanessa Matsis-McCready, associate general counsel and vice president of HR Services for Engage PEO. ""Most employees in the private sector do not have any protections for that type of speech at work.""Add to that the prevalence of social media, which has made it increasingly common to track employees' conduct outside of work and to dox people, or publish information about them online with the intent of harming or harassing them.Protections for workers vary from one state to the next. For example, in New York, if an employee is participating in a weekend political protest, but not associating themselves with the organisation that employs them, their employer cannot fire them for that activity when they return to work.But if that same employee is at a company event on a weekend and talks about their political viewpoints in a way that makes others feel unsafe or the target of discrimination or harassment, then they could face consequences at work, Matsis-McCready said.Most of the US defaults to ""at-will"" employment law - which essentially means employers can choose to hire and fire as they see fit. ""The First Amendment does not apply in private workplaces to protect employees' speech,"" said Andrew Kragie, an attorney who specialises in employment and labour law. ""It does protect employers' right to make decisions about employees, based on employees' speech.""","In the days following the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, numerous workers have been fired for their comments on his death.

More Than 150,000 Evacuated in Pakistan Punjab After India’s Flood Alert

Waters recede, but threat not over

Fields and cattle lost





Even as floodwaters began to recede in parts of south Punjab, the scale of destruction remains staggering, nearly 2.5 million people have been forced to flee their homes and at least 101 lives have been lost, the Dawn reported.The Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) has called the ongoing evacuation and relief drive one of the largest in recent memory. More than 1,500 boats were deployed to rescue stranded families, with 12,427 people evacuated from villages along the Chenab, Ravi and Sutlej rivers.Multan, Muzaffargarh and Rahim Yar Khan districts bore the brunt of the floods. Entire villages were submerged — including the union council of Lati Mari in Alipur tehsil, home to 40,000 people.“Nearly 15,000 people from our basti had to leave on their own as water rose,” said Syed Kausar Shah, a local resident. “Homes and crops were destroyed, and people escaped on a hired boat. Some now live in relief camps, others under the open sky.” He added that two villagers drowned while attempting to flee.Officials declared Jalalpur Pirwala and Alipur tehsils safe after a major flood wave passed through Head Panjnad.Multan Deputy Commissioner Waseem Hamid Sindhu confirmed that 100,000 people had been evacuated from Jalalpur Pirwala alone in three days.Breaches in Shujabad and Jalalpur Pirwala are now being filled, while helicopters and drones drop food and medicine into cut-off areas. Boats continue to ferry supplies into rural belts.At a press briefing in Bahawalpur, PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said Panjnad Headworks still faced a “high flood” but levels had dropped from 700,000 cusecs earlier this week to 575,000 cusecs on Saturday. By evening, the Flood Forecasting Division reported further decline to 492,695 cusecs.“There is no threat to Jalalpur Pirwala and Alipur cities,” Kathia assured, adding that water in Bahawalpur would also recede within 24 hours. He called the scale of evacuation “historic,” stressing that Multan could have faced forced evacuations if operations were delayed.According to official data, 4,447 mouzas across 28 districts have been inundated. Alongside the mass displacement of people, more than 2.19 million cattle were rescued and shifted to higher ground.For now, the rivers appear to be calming, the Sutlej at Ganda Singh Wala was recorded at 95,000 cusecs, categorised as medium flood.

Protests Erupt in Pakistan, as Imran Khan Supporters Call for His Release

The sons of jailed former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said their father “will not be broken” by his “unlawful” imprisonment, as his legal team lodged an appeal with the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture.The elder son, Sulaiman Khan, condemned Khan's treatment in a statement attached to the appeal:Our father is being kept in conditions that no human being should endure. These are violations of his rights, and they amount to torture.”The younger son, Kasim Khan, said:The UN has already recognised that our father’s imprisonment is arbitrary and unlawful. What he is enduring now shows how far the regime will go to break him. But he will not be broken.”Sulaiman and Kasim are the cricketer-turned-politician’s sons with British filmmaker Jemima Goldsmith, with whom he was married for nine years until 2004. They live in the UK with Goldsmith.The appeal, filed by the US-based law firm Perseus Strategies on behalf of Khan’s legal team, alleged a “systematic pattern of abuse, including prolonged solitary confinement, denial of medical care, contaminated food, and restricted access to legal counsel and family visits.”His lawyers argued that these conditions breach Pakistan’s obligations under the UN Convention against Torture (CAT) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).

Poll Do you believe the reconstruction of LeT's Markaz Taiba is a threat to regional security? Yes, it poses a significant threat. No, it will not impact security.

How India destroyed LeT HQ



Why its reconstruction is a matter of concern?







Pakistan is financing the reconstruction of Lashkar-e-Taiba’s (LeT) Muridke headquarters, Markaz Taiba, which was destroyed in precision airstrikes during Operation Sindoor on May 7. According to ANI, citing an agency dossier, LeT has launched fundraising campaigns under the pretext of flood relief to support the redevelopment project.Moreover, Islamabad has already allocated PKR 4 crore, though the group estimates costs at over PKR 15 crore. The dossier stated that its army and ISI remain involved in sustaining and reviving LeT.Senior commanders Maulana Abu Zar and Yunus Shah Bukhari are overseeing the project, due by February 2026, mirroring past cases where LeT diverted humanitarian aid, including most of the 2005 earthquake relief, to militant infrastructure.This comes amidst Pakistan's continuous assertions on global platforms that it was combating terrorism.The Indian Air Force (IAF), earlier this year, showcased the extensive damage caused to LeT Muridke headquarters during Operation Sindoor, highlighting the precision and reach of the strikes.Muridke, home to LeT’s Markaz Taiba, was identified as a critical target. The strikes hit senior leadership residential areas and office buildings where commanders convened for planning and operations.The IAF showed videos captured directly from the weapons, pointing out the level of devastation within the complex.The airstrikes reportedly killed around a dozen high-value terrorists, including Yusuf Azhar, the IC-814 hijacker, Abu Jundal (also known as Mudassar), the Muridke chief of LeT, and the son of the planner of the 2016 Nagrota attack. The operation, conducted in retaliation for the Pahalgam killings, reinforced India’s ability to carry out precise, high-impact missions inside enemy territory.The ongoing reconstruction of LeT Markaz Taiba headquarters has raised serious concerns regarding regional security, given the facility’s central role in training and radicalizing terrorists. Established in 2000, the complex serves as both a residence for senior commanders and a training ground where recruits are instructed in intelligence gathering, arms handling, and other operational skills. Analysts warn that reviving the facility could strengthen LeT’s operational capabilities and enable the recruitment of new militants.Markaz Taiba functions as the “alma mater” of LeT, providing courses that combine physical and arms training with ideological indoctrination. The center attracts recruits from within Pakistan and abroad, using religious and radicalization programs to cultivate loyalty and operational skills among future militants. Its facilities, including a mosque and guest house financed by Osama bin Laden, underscore the longstanding support the organization has received from international terror networks.The scale of the operation at Markaz Taiba further amplifies the threat. The facility reportedly trains around 1,000 students annually, preparing them for operational roles within LeT. Past evidence has shown that graduates of this center have gone on to participate in high-profile attacks, including the 26/11 Mumbai attacks, highlighting the direct link between the facility and acts of cross-border terrorism targeting India.LeT’s historical connection with Pakistan’s intelligence apparatus adds another layer of concern. Senior commanders at the facility, including those who oversaw training for the 26/11 perpetrators, have operated under the guidance of the ISI.","Pakistan is financing the reconstruction of Lashkar-e-Taiba’s (LeT) Muridke headquarters, Markaz Taiba.

A Pakistani Taliban ambush in northwest Pakistan on Saturday resulted in the deaths of at least 12 soldiers, as confirmed by local government and security officials to AFP.During a military convoy's passage through South Waziristan district at 4:00 am, ""armed men opened fire from both sides with heavy weapons"", resulting in 12 security personnel deaths and four injuries, according to a local government official.The area's security officer verified the casualties and reported that the assailants captured the convoy's weaponry.The Tehreek-e-Taliban (TTP), also known as the Pakistani Taliban, took responsibility for the attack via social media.This incident ranks among the most severe attacks in recent months within Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where the TTP previously controlled significant territories until a 2014 military operation forced their retreat.Since the Afghan Taliban's return to power in Kabul in 2021, militant activities have intensified in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border regions. Although distinct organisations, the TTP maintains close ties with the Afghan Taliban.Pakistan contends that Afghanistan fails to remove militants who use Afghan soil to attack Pakistan, whilst Kabul authorities reject these claims.Local residents across various Khyber Pakhtunkhwa districts have recently reported TTP-branded graffiti appearing on buildings, expressing concerns about a potential return to the group's previous control during the height of the US ""War on Terror"".A high-ranking local government official recently informed AFP about increased TTP fighter presence and attack frequency.Since January 1, approximately 460 individuals, predominantly security forces personnel, have lost their lives in attacks by anti-state armed groups in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan provinces, according to AFP's records.Pakistan experienced its most lethal period in nearly ten years during the previous year, with over 1,600 fatalities, including almost half being soldiers and police officers, as reported by the Islamabad-based Center for Research and Security Studies.","Pakistani Taliban ambush in northwest Pakistan kills at least 12 soldiers.

Poll Is it ethical for governments to use technology from foreign countries for surveillance? Yes, if it protects citizens No, it compromises sovereignty





Pakistan — with the help of Chinese technology — is spying on millions of its citizens to curb dissent and free speech, an Amnesty International report said.According to the report, Pakistan is using a Chinese-built internet firewall that censors social media, enabling spy agencies to monitor at least 4 million mobile phones at a time through its Lawful Intercept Management System (LIMS). The firewall, known as WMS 2.0, inspects internet traffic and can block 2 million active sessions at once.The human rights watchdog said it reviewed licensing agreements, trade data, leaked technical files, and Chinese records linking the firewall supplier to state-owned firms in Beijing.Amnesty said the firewall uses equipment from US-based Niagara Networks, software from Thales DIS — a unit of France's Thales — and servers from a Chinese state IT firm. An earlier version relied on Canada’s Sandvine.""The two monitoring systems function in tandem: one lets intelligence agencies tap calls and texts, while the other slows or blocks websites and social media across the country,"" the report said.""Mass surveillance creates a chilling effect in society, whereby people are deterred from exercising their rights, both online and offline,"" it added.The report further said that Pakistan is currently blocking about 650,000 web links and restricting access to platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, and X.It also accused agencies of spying on at least 4 million mobile phones at a time through LIMS, while WMS 2.0 can block 2 million active sessions at once, Amnesty said.Amnesty noted that its findings draw on a 2024 Islamabad High Court case filed by Bushra Bibi, the wife of former Prime Minister Imran Khan, after her private calls were leaked online.In court, Pakistan's defense ministries and intelligence agencies denied running or even having the capacity for phone tapping. However, under questioning, the telecom regulator admitted it had already ordered phone companies to install LIMS for use by ""designated agencies.""Crackdowns have tightened in recent years, particularly after the military broke with then Prime Minister Imran Khan in 2022. Khan was later jailed, and thousands of his party activists were detained.","Amnesty International: Pakistan using Chinese-built internet firewall that censors social media.

Aleema Khan, sister of Pakistan 's jailed former prime minister Imran Khan , was attacked with an egg while addressing reporters outside Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail on Friday.A video of the episode has gone viral on social media, showing the egg hitting Aleema as she spoke to the media.Supporters of Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party quickly apprehended two women accused of throwing the eggs and handed them over to police, news agency PTI reported.Rawalpindi police said the arrested women were PTI party supporters who had travelled with members of the All-Government Employees Grand Alliance to protest against unmet demands.The statement added that the egg was thrown after Aleema did not respond to questions from the two women. Both were later taken into custody and moved to the Adiala checkpoint.PTI condemned the act as “shameful,” alleging the women were planted for political motives and accusing police of helping them escape in a car. “The women were sent to Aleema's media talk as part of an agenda,” the party said.Leaders across the political spectrum criticized the attack.Balochistan National Party-Mengal chief Akhtar Mengal condemned the act, calling it “the lowest form of politics.”He said, “Even in enmity, a woman deserves dignity. Targeting women is the lowest form of politics, and this cheap stunt must be condemned in the strongest words.”Federal minister for development Ahsan Iqbal said, “Politics must remain a contest of ideas, not of violence or hatred. We should all work to keep it healthy and respectful.”Meanwhile, PML-N leader Khawaja Saad Rafique described the incident as “shameful, vile and crude.”Imran Khan has been in prison for more than two years facing multiple charges. In January 2025, a Pakistani tribunal sentenced the former prime minister to 14 years in prison, while his wife, Bushra Bibi, received a seven-year sentence in connection with a corruption case involving land graft.The allegations centred on the acceptance of land from a property magnate in exchange for facilitating money laundering during Khan’s tenure as prime minister.Prior to this verdict, Khan had received three separate convictions related to corruption, disclosure of state secrets, and violations of marriage laws, carrying sentences of 10, 14 and seven years respectively.","Aleema Khan was attacked with an egg while addressing reporters outside Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail on Friday.

A relatively unknown militant group, Ittihad-ul-Mujahideen (IuM) Pakistan, has claimed responsibility for the suicide car bomb attack on the Federal Constabulary Corps in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Bannu division on Tuesday.The outfit claimed the attack, which involved a car rigged with IED, killed more than two dozen members of the Frontier Corps but Pakistan acknowledged only six fatalities. Predictably, it blamed India for the attack. Pakistan claimed to have neutralised five operatives in a 12-hour counter operation but the group asserted that its 'fidayeen' blew themselves up after carrying out the attack. One of the suicide bombers was identified by the group as Abdul Aziz alias Qassid Mohajir, a resident of Afghanistan's Paktika province.The Pakistan army camp suffered massive destruction in the suicide attack. Pakistan military's ISPR played down the incident, the latest in a series of attacks on Pakistani military personnel. ""During early hours of Sept 2, Indian proxy 'Fitna al Khwarij' targeted the Federal Constabulary Headquarters in Bannu district. The Indian-sponsored Kharjis attempted to breach the perimeter security, however, their nefarious designs were swiftly foiled by vigilant and resolute response.In their desperation, the Kahrjis rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into the perimeter wall. The suicide blast resulted in the partial collapse of the perimeter wall and damage to adjacent civilian infrastructure, inflicting injuries to three innocent civilians,"" ISPR said.IuM Pakistan, active since April, comprises fighters from outfits like Hafiz Gul Bahadur Group, Lashkar-e-Islam and Jamaat-Ul-Ahrar. In the last few months, it has claimed multiple attacks in areas like North Waziristan, Miranshah and Tirah Valley. Its strikes included sniper, rocket launcher and grenade attacks, and ambushes on convoys, besides drone strikes. Its formation had attracted criticism from groups like Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan which termed itself as the most structured and legitimate jihadi group in Pakistan.","Ittihad-ul-Mujahideen (IuM) Pakistan has claimed responsibility for the suicide car bomb attack on the Federal Constabulary Corps in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Bannu division on Tuesday.

Two provincial officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed the death toll to AFP.Emergency services rushed to the scene as authorities launched an investigation into the attack.According to Dawn, Advocate Sajid Tareen, acting president of the BNP-M the attack took place shortly after a party rally marking the death anniversary of BNP founder Attaullah Mengal.A statement from the Balochistan Home Department confirmed that rescue teams had reached the site and that the wounded were being treated in local hospitals. Security forces swiftly cordoned off the area and have begun collecting evidence.Balochistan chief minister Sarfraz Bugti strongly condemned the attack, calling it a “cowardly act of enemies of humanity.” He said “malicious elements” were targeting innocent civilians and vowed that the “evil intentions of terrorists” would be defeated.No group has yet claimed responsibility.Pakistani forces have battled an insurgency in Balochistan for over a decade, with violence escalating in 2024 as 782 people were killed. In March, the Baloch Liberation Army seized a train, taking passengers hostage and killing off-duty troops in a three-day siege.Since January 1, over 430 people, mostly security forces, have died in attacks by armed groups in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

Pakistan had earlier suspended ties with Armenia following its occupation of Azerbaijani territories and consistently regarded Armenia as an aggressor, while also supporting UN Security Council resolutions affirming Azerbaijan’s territorial integrity.On the sidelines of the SCO meet, Aliyev also met with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. The leaders vowed continued growth of bilateral relations, emphasizing their ""brotherly ties"" and strategic partnership across sectors, including energy and transport.India’s trade and tourism ties with Turkey and Azerbaijan remain strained after both countries expressed support for Pakistan and criticised India’s recent strikes on terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.Their stance has triggered nationwide calls in India to boycott goods from Turkey and Azerbaijan and to avoid travel to these countries.",Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev has accused India of blocking Azerbaijan's bid for full membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.

""It will eventually be auctioned to scrap dealers through tenders once cleanup is complete,"" he added.Among the areas that were ravaged in the Sept 8-9 'Gen Z' protests that led to downfall of the KP Sharma Oli government were the historic Singha Durbar, the Supreme Court, office of the attorney general, and the parliament building in Kathmandu. Besides, scores of govt offices in around 250 municipalities were damaged due to vandalism and arson, a spokesperson at the ministry of federal affairs and general administration was quoted as saying by The Kathmandu Post.Biratnagar’s four-storey municipal building was reduced to rubble, while two ward offices were burned. Birgunj saw three of its seven buildings rendered unusable, and 95 per cent of municipal properties destroyed, the newspaper reported.“What happened to the properties was very unfortunate. They should not have been damaged. But then somebody has to now take care of disposal of the mess. Scrap dealers will do that,” said Paban Tamling, a local scrap merchant. He added that business could triple or even quadruple.“Before the protest, the annual business of scrap dealing in Kathmandu was around 2 crore Nepalese rupees. But now, after the vandalism and arson, it would easily cross over 5 crore,” Tamling added.Deepak Jaiswal, who runs the recycling firm 'Thalo Kawadi', echoed the sentiment. “We are waiting for officials to finish assessing the damage and then float tenders. The number of bidders this time will surely increase, as many will try to jump into the business.

Nepal Anarchy: Mobs Chase Deputy PM, Strip Finance Minister, Burn Govt Offices, Homes Of Politicians





Nepal police have re-arrested over 3,700 inmates who escaped during last week’s violent anti-government protests, officials said on Sunday.Deputy Inspector General Binod Ghimire, spokesperson for Nepal Police, reported that 3,723 prisoners have been returned to jail, while 10,320 remain at large, urging the public to remain alert.More than 13,500 inmates escaped from prisons across Nepal within 24 hours of the Gen Z protest movement, triggering the country’s worst internal security crisis in decades. The mass jailbreak has also raised concerns in India, where some fugitives are wanted or linked to criminal networks along the Bihar and Uttar Pradesh border.While a handful of escapees have reportedly promised to return once unrest subsides, most remain untraceable. The crisis has been further complicated by the burning of court records in arson attacks, hampering follow-up action by authorities.A joint campaign by the Nepali Army, Nepal Police, and Armed Police Force is underway to track down and arrest the escaped prisoners, DIG Binod Ghimire said, as cited by PTI.Among the escapees are some of Nepal’s most notorious convicts and politically sensitive detainees. They include former junior minister Sanjay ‘Takla’ Sah, convicted for the 2012 Janakpur bomb blast and the 2007 murder of industrialist Arun Kumar Singhania.Others are kidnapper Uday Shetti, known for cross-border operations in the Raxaul-Sitamarhi corridor, suspended deputy prime minister Top Bahadur Rayamajhi, on trial in the fake Bhutanese refugee scam, and former home secretary Tek Narayan Pandey. Singhania’s killing drew outrage in Bihar and Jharkhand, where his family remains active in business and media.","More than 13,500 inmates escaped from prisons across Nepal within 24 hours of the Gen Z protest movement.

As she took charge of Nepal's interim prime minister on Sunday, Sushila Karki’s first act was to define the limits of her own power. Taking charge at Singha Durbar on Sunday, the former Chief Justice made clear that her government is only a bridge to elections.In the same breath, she located the moral core of her authority in the Gen Z protests of September 8, declaring those killed as ""martyrs"" and promising their families state compensation. By doing so, Karki framed her government not as a continuation of discredited politics, but as an answer to the demand for justice that brought her to power.Sushila Karki, former Chief Justice of Nepal, became the country’s first woman to hold the post of prime minister when she assumed office at Singha Durbar on Sunday, days after violent protests across the country.After taking charge, Karki addressed the media and said her government’s role is limited to ensuring stability, justice, and preparing for elections within six months.She inherits an office vacated by KP Sharma Oli after days of violent protests left 72 people dead. These protests, led largely by young Nepalis, were sparked by the government’s social media ban but quickly turned into a movement demanding accountability, economic reform, and an end to corruption.""I and my team are not here to taste the power. We won't stay for more than six months. We will hand over the responsibility to the new parliament. We won't succeed without your support,"" she said at a press conference.She recognised the September 8 youth-led protest and announced that those who died will be honoured as martyrs. She also declared that their families would receive compensation of NRs one million each.""27 hours of movement is first in Nepal. They are demanding economic equality and the eradication of corruption. All the deceased of September 8 are announced martyrs and will be given one million each. Expenses of the injured will be borne by the government, and they will also be compensated,"" she said.According to The Himalayan Times, 72 people have died in the protests so far — 59 demonstrators, 10 prison inmates, and three police officers.Karki said the government would help in sending the bodies of the deceased to their home districts. She also said that those who suffered damage to personal property will be supported by the state. Reconstruction and economic recovery will be a priority. ""We are in an economic crisis. We should discuss and work on the reconstruction,"" she added.Karki, who earlier served as Nepal’s first female Chief Justice, has taken over with the backing of the Gen Z-led protest movement.The September 8 demonstrations, led mainly by young activists, were triggered by anger over corruption, lack of accountability, and the government’s decision to ban social media.The 73-year-old was sworn in as interim Prime Minister on Friday. Protesters had endorsed her name, citing her independence and integrity, after Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli resigned following the unrest.","Sushila Karki, former Chief Justice of Nepal, became the country’s first woman to hold the post of prime minister when she assumed office on Sunday.

Nepal Turmoil: Army Chief Steps In, Promises Tough Action Against Violence, Curfew In Place On Day 3





KATHMANDU: Nepal felt different Saturday morning. Curfew was completely lifted and all restrictions on movement were off for the first time after Gen Z protests brought the nation to a grinding halt. ""It's like a new morning,"" Kumar Khaling, 21, merrily sauntering on a side path at Kathmandu's Durbar Square said.It would have been the same in Pokhara, Chitwan and Ramechhap as the country began its slow march towards peace and normal life.In Kathmandu, citizens, first cautiously in the early hours and then more freely by afternoon, came out on the roads, stopping by still-smouldering buildings that had been torched a few days ago in the violence that eventually brought down the KP Sharma Oli govt. One of them lingered around an office in the Singha Durbar area, taking out his camera-phone to take a photo. But he changed his mind and walked past.And though formerly unbreachable buildings like Nepal's Parliament and Supreme Court lay defeated and defaced, many passersby stopped in front to gaze at the remains of the structures, as if mulling what it would take to bring them back to life.Groups of men and women milled around Pashupatinath temple, one of the country's most revered, seeking strength and clarity.""God will guide us,"" a boy barely out of his teens grinned, a red tika on his forehead. ""New day, New Nepal,"" he declared to no one in particular.Ganesh Khadka, 32, who works as a taxi driver, said, “You know, people were fed up with corruption by those in power. And when Gen Z people started trending ‘Nepo Kids’, with photos of children of politicians enjoying lavish lifestyles during foreign trips, something broke. Hurt turned into rage. See what's happened now.""Another resident, Pasang Sherpa, 27, who works as a receptionist in a Kathmandu resort, explained: ""The world saw what we achieved. We threw out Oli and his supporters in just two days. Politicians in Nepal will in future think twice before taking our people for a ride.""Earlier in the day, newly appointed prime minister Sushila Karki met injured Gen Z protesters undergoing treatment at various hospitals in the city and wished them speedy recovery. ""Your sacrifice will help pave the way for a better Nepal,"" she said. She also dropped by police station buildings that were razed in the city to assess damage.But the euphoria was tinged both with hope and sorrow. ""We also suffered much,"" Pemba Sherpa, 28, said. ""So many lives lost. To be honest, I have mixed emotions. Our biggest festival, Dashain, is a fortnight away, but it won’t be joyous for grieving families. How can we celebrate when they are drowning in sorrow.""By late evening, the Kathmandu administration had also announced resumption of classes in schools from Monday. It asked teachers to come a day ahead, on Sunday, and prepare a report on the damages.“Those unable to attend classes in person will be offered virtual lessons until the situation fully normalizes,” a statement issued by it said.","All restrictions on movement were off for the first time after Gen Z protests brought the nation to a grinding halt.

KATHMANDU: With the situation in the country gradually returning to normal, Nepal’s security agencies and authorities are now desperate to see its 12,000-odd inmates who escaped from different jails during the protest back in their barracks.While security agencies were able to nab around 1,500 inmates -- out of the total 13,500 who had fled -- the majority are still missing. What has added to the anxiety of the administration is that the escapees include some notorious criminals, like dreaded gold smuggler Chudamani Upreti, who was lodged in Sundhara Central jail from where around 3,200 inmates escaped on Sept 9.Staring at an unprecedented internal security problem, officials have appealed to the general population for help in the form of tip-offs. Many have responded, informing police about the whereabouts of an escapee, sometimes nabbing the criminals themselves before handing them over.On Saturday, the country’s National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) joined in, asking the jailbirds to return and surrender the weapons looted on Sept 9.Expressing concern, it said that the jailbreaks had caused a sense of fear and insecurity among citizens, many of whom have in turn run away from their homes fearing reprisals.“The jailbreaks have caused distress among women, children and victims of crime. We urge security agencies to intensify efforts in searching for the fugitives and bring them back to their respective cells,” the rights body said.Amid the appeals by authorities, Rabi Lamichhane, president of Nepal’s Rashtriya Swatantra Party, returned to the Nakhu prison on Saturday. He was arrested in October last year for his alleged involvement in the Supreme Cooperative fraud case and was lodged in Nakhu prison in Lalitpur, from where he had escaped on Sept 9, citing ""security concerns during the violence"".Releasing a public notice, authorities said: ""It is urged that the escapees abide by legal procedures and social responsibility by returning voluntarily. Failure to do so would result in their continued status as fugitives along with enforcement of harsher penalties under Prison Act 2022 and other prevailing laws.""","Nepal's security agencies and authorities are desperate to see 12,000-odd inmates who escaped back in their barracks.

KATHMANDU: A day after the appointment of former chief justice of Nepal Sushila Karki as new PM of the Himalayan nation's interim govt, most major political parties on Saturday came out to oppose the move, terming it ""unconstitutional"". Many of their leaders also questioned the Gen Z-led protests, which triggered the fall of the KP Sharma Oli govt, and claimed it was ""scripted to overthrow an elected govt"".Showing overnight unity on the issue, the eight key -- and disparate -- political parties of the country issued a joint statement in the evening, demanding that the ""interim govt immediately revoke its decision of dissolving Parliament"". The statement was released by the chief whips of Nepali Congress, Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist), Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre), Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Socialist), Janata Samajbadi Party, Janamat Party and others.Their opposition came after President Ramchandra Paudel’s office earlier released a statement on dissolution of Parliament, following it up with an announcement on the date of fresh election -- March 5, 2026. He said he took the decision on the ""recommendation of the newly appointed PM"".Claiming that the new set of developments could herald a constitutional crisis in the coming days, Pradip Gyawali, deputy general secretary of Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) and former minister of foreign affairs told TOI that ""it all is completely against the existing constitutional framework"".Gyawali added: “Our constitution prohibits a non-parliamentarian (Karki in this case) from becoming the country’s prime minister, which has now happened. Apart from this, it is also against the supreme court’s verdict which had come in March 2021 and June 2021, stating that Parliament can be dissolved only after first trying out the four acceptable ways to make a govt. None of this happened here; none of the methods were applied before dissolving parliament. ""He further raised apprehensions on holding elections within six 6 months. “I suspect Nepal will go the Bangladesh way, where elections are yet to be held after last year’s movement.”Chairperson of Nepal’s Rashtriya Janamorcha party and former deputy PM Chitra Bahadur KC added that formation of the interim govt ""basically is aimed at defeating the constitution, which we completely oppose"".He said, ""The only way to solve the crisis is to see a democratically elected govt installed after immediately conducting free and fair elections.”Another senior leader from Nepali Congress told TOI that “the Gen Z-led agitation had more to it than just being a voice against corruption. It seemed to be scripted to overthrow an elected govt.”The Nepali Congress leader went on: “Initially, the issues raised by them (Gen Z) including graft and joblessness seemed valid. But soon, too many dramatic events happened within a very short span of time, which was beyond our understanding. The protest was hijacked by people with vested interests. The decision to form an interim govt after dissolving parliament is likely to soon be challenged before the supreme court. Nepal Bar Association has already said that they will seek clarity on it as per provisions of our constitution.”This came even as Paudel on Saturday evening appealed to all sides to ""support the process of holding parliamentary elections as scheduled on March 5, 2026.""A statement from the president's office said: “After exemplary efforts during a very difficult and complex situation in the country, the peaceful resolution to hold the next elections was found while preserving the constitution and keeping the federal democratic republic intact.

(Agencies)

A lawsuit was filed on Monday against the University of California, US, accusing the public university system of racial discrimination in its admissions process. The complaint, submitted in a federal district court in California, claims that the university gives unfair preference to Black and Hispanic applicants, violating antidiscrimination laws.The lawsuit was brought by Students Against Racial Discrimination , a group representing White and Asian students who argue that the admissions process should not consider race. The group wants the university to change its policies to comply with federal antidiscrimination laws, the 14th Amendment , and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits racial discrimination by institutions receiving federal funding. If successful, the lawsuit would prevent the university from considering or asking about an applicant’s race during admissions.In response, the University of California said that racial and ethnic data collected in undergraduate applications is ""for statistical purposes only and they are not used for admission."" The university also said it has adjusted its admissions policies to follow Proposition 209, which bans affirmative action in California.This lawsuit follows the US Supreme Court’s June 2023 decision that struck down affirmative action in college admissions at Harvard University and the University of North Carolina. It also comes at a time when some companies are reducing diversity initiatives , which have been criticized by US President Donald Trump and other conservative leaders.Students Against Racial Discrimination, founded in 2024, said that its goal is to ""restore meritocracy in academia"" and oppose admissions policies that prioritize diversity over academic qualifications.The lawsuit claims that the University of California uses a ""holistic"" admissions approach, similar to a system first implemented at UCLA, to reduce differences in admission rates between Black, Hispanic, and other applicants.Since a state referendum was passed in 1996, the nine University of California schools—including the highly selective UCLA and UC Berkeley—have been prohibited from considering race in admissions decisions.The plaintiffs claim that in the years following the referendum, the University of California system spent hundreds of millions of dollars to strengthen the pathway from high school to college for students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. This effort led to an increase in Black and Hispanic applicants and enrollments.","Students Against Racial Discrimination, founded in 2024, said that its goal is to ""restore meritocracy in academia"" The lawsuit follows the US Supreme Court’s June 2023 decision that struck down affirmative action in college admissions at Harvard University and the University of North Carolina.

TOKYO: The Japanese government is considering offering medical care in the world's fourth-largest economy for sick and wounded residents of Gaza, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said.Ishiba told a parliament session on Monday that his administration is working on a policy to provide support in Japan for ""those who are ill or injured in Gaza"".He said that educational opportunities could also be offered to people from Gaza, which is under a fragile ceasefire with Israel.Ishiba was responding to a lawmaker who had asked whether a 2017 scheme to accept Syrian refugees as students could be used as a reference point to help Gaza residents.""We are thinking about launching a similar programme for Gaza, and the government will make efforts towards the realisation of this plan,"" Ishiba said.The measures discussed in parliament are different to Japan's main asylum policy, which has long been criticised for the low number of claims granted by the nation.In 2023, Japan accepted 1,310 people seeking asylum -- less than 10 percent of the 13,823 applicants.Under a different framework, as of the end of last year, Japan had accepted a total of 82 people as students from Syria who were recognised as refugees by the UN refugee agency, a foreign ministry official in charge of aid programmes said.That scheme was aimed at educating future leaders of Syria as part of Japan's long-term foreign aid policy, the official told AFP.The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said 50 Palestinian patients, including 30 children with cancer, and their companions went through the reopened Rafah crossing to Egypt on Saturday as part of the ceasefire deal, which came into effect on January 19.The director of Gaza hospitals said 6,000 patients were ready to be transferred from the Palestinian territory, and more than 12,000 were ""in dire need of treatment"".",Japan considering offering medical care in the world's fourth-largest economy for sick and wounded residents of Gaza.

The conservative push against USAID

What happens next?

The United States agency for international development ( USAID ), long regarded as the country's primary force for humanitarian aid, is facing an uncertain future after being placed under the direction of secretary of state Marco Rubio on Monday. The move, widely seen as a precursor to its potential dissolution or absorption into the state department, has raised concerns among global aid organisations and Democratic lawmakers.Founded in 1961 as an independent agency, USAID has been instrumental in delivering essential humanitarian aid, including health services, disaster relief, and anti-poverty programs across the globe. Its work spans a wide spectrum, from supporting war relief in Ukraine and peace-building in Somalia to disease surveillance in Cambodia and vaccination efforts in Nigeria. USAID has played a key role in containing deadly outbreaks, including Ebola, and has been lauded for its ability to respond swiftly to global health crises.Dr Atul Gawande, a senior USAID official in the Biden administration, recently highlighted the agency's global impact. ""We built out a network of 50-plus countries on every continent, developing what I've called the world's immune system -- an ever-accelerating capacity to prevent, detect, and more rapidly respond to pandemic threats,"" he said in an address before Trump's inauguration, according to NYT.Despite its extensive reach, USAID accounts for only a small fraction of the federal budget. With an annual budget of approximately $23 billion, the agency spent $38.1 billion in fiscal year 2023—less than 1% of total government spending. Its efficiency, however, has not shielded it from conservative scrutiny. The recently established department of government efficiency, led by Elon Musk 's cost-cutting task force, has identified USAID as a target for budget reductions.USAID's workforce is structured differently from most Washington agencies, relying heavily on contract workers rather than permanent civil service employees. This has made the agency particularly vulnerable to sudden budgetary cuts. Reports indicate that nearly half of USAID's workforce has been eliminated in the past week, with hundreds of contractors fired or placed on leave. Additionally, many nongovernmental organisations (NGOs) that implement USAID programs have been forced to shut down offices due to frozen funding.Republican leaders, including Rubio, have criticised USAID for operating as a ""global charity"" that does not always align with US national interests. The agency has also been the target of foreign governments such as Russia, which view its work as a challenge to their own influence.Musk and Trump's decision to reevaluate USAID's operations has been met with bipartisan concern. Senator Amy Klobuchar warned on social media that dismantling the agency ""would make the world a more dangerous place for Americans and be a gift to China and Russia.""The extent of the funding freeze remains unclear, but internal communications suggest that programs related to diversity, women's reproductive rights, and climate resilience are at immediate risk of being cut.With Trump's three-month assessment period now in effect, the fate of USAID remains uncertain. While Republican leaders argue that foreign aid should be more closely tied to US strategic interests, Democratic lawmakers insist that dismantling the agency could have dire consequences for global stability and America's international standing. The coming months will determine whether USAID is restructured, downsized, or shuttered entirely—an outcome that could reshape US foreign policy for years to come.","The United States agency for international development ( USAID ) is facing an uncertain future after being placed under the direction of secretary of state Marco Rubio on Monday.

President Donald Trump signalled Monday that US support for Ukraine's war effort could be tied to securing access to the country's rare earth materials.Speaking from the Oval Office, Trump expressed frustration over what he seeks as an imbalance in aid contributions between the US and Europe, stating, ""We're looking to do a deal with Ukraine where they're going to secure what we're giving them with their rare earth and other things.""Trump suggested that Ukrainian officials were open to such an agreement, pointing out the strategic importance of rare earth minerals to the high-tech economy.“I want to have security of rare earth,” he said. “We’re putting in hundreds of billions of dollars.

Poll Should Alcohol Consumption Be Regulated More Strictly? No, It’s A Personal Choice Yes, It Should Be Better Controlled

Canada’s Trudeau announces 25% counter tariffs on US goods | LIVE

Government-run liquor stores in Canada's British Columbia have initiated removing US-made alcohol brands from Republican-led states in response to new American tariffs on Canadian goods.Meanwhile, two more Canadian provinces are planning to get rid of all American alcohol, reported NY post.According to CBC news, by Sunday afternoon, whisky brands such as Jack Daniel’s were absent from store shelves at BC liquor stores’ Cambie Street location in Vancouver, replaced by signs encouraging customers to ""Buy Canadian Instead.""Outgoing Canadian PM Justin Trudeau called on people to ""choose Canada"" and buy Canadian-made products.In a post on X, Trudeau wrote: ""Now is the time to choose products made right here in Canada. Check the labels. Let’s do our part. Wherever we can, choose Canada.""The move came after a directive from BC premier David Eby, who announced Saturday that the province’s liquor distribution branch would stop purchasing alcohol from US states with Republican governors, as CBC news reported.“We have targeted red states because, quite frankly, Donald Trump doesn’t care about Democrat states,” said Housing minister Ravi Kahlon, chair of the cabinet committee overseeing the province’s tariff response. “We want to make sure that we’re not punishing states that have nothing to do with this.”The decision comes after US President Donald Trump signed executive orders Saturday imposing a 25% tariff on most Canadian imports, with a 10% tariff specifically on Canadian energy products.In his order, Trump referenced British Columbia’s role in the “heightened domestic production of fentanyl,” tying it to his justification for the tariffs, alongside concerns about illegal border crossings.However, Kahlon dismissed this claim, instead pointing to a post from Trump’s X account where the president suggested Canada should become the ""Cherished 51st State.""Trump wrote on his Truth Social post: ""We pay hundreds of Billions of Dollars to SUBSIDIZE Canada. Why? There is no reason. We don’t need anything they have. We have unlimited Energy, should make our own Cars, and have more Lumber than we can ever use. Without this massive subsidy, Canada ceases to exist as a viable Country. Harsh but true! Therefore, Canada should become our Cherished 51st State. Much lower taxes, and far better military protection for the people of Canada — AND NO TARIFFS!""""This was never about border crossings,"" Kahlon said. ""This was always about causing economic harm.""The BC liquor distribution branch notified industry associations on February 1 that it would support the provincial and federal response to the tariffs by removing on-hand inventory of products from Republican-led states.Affected brands include Jack Daniel’s, Bacardi Rum , Tito’s Vodka, Jim Beam , and Bulleit Bourbon, which will be replaced with Canadian alternatives.Some local bars and BC-based distillers have also voiced support for the move, using it as an opportunity to promote domestic products.","Government-run liquor stores in Canada's British Columbia have initiated removing US-made alcohol brands from Republican-led states.

How USAID Gave America Influence Around the World



The Big Picture: Advantage China?

In Frederick Forsyth’s, a veteran British spymaster explains to the American spymaster Paul Devereux:This observation rings true when considering America’s global role—not just as a superpower but as a benefactor. Ask many who’ve been on the receiving end of US largesse, and they’ll argue that America’s “gifts” often come with strings attached. One of the most recognizable symbols of this aid is the United States Agency for International Development, or USAID .USAID is an independent agency of the US government, responsible for administering civilian foreign aid and development assistance. Established in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy, its mission has been to promote economic development, support disaster relief, and foster democratic governance around the world. Over the decades, USAID has managed substantial budgets to support its initiatives. In fiscal year 2023 alone, it oversaw more than $40 billion in appropriations—accounting for over a third of the funds allocated to the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and related programs.But the era of American largesse (or manipulation) may be coming to an abrupt end.In January 2025, President Donald Trump ordered a near-total freeze on foreign aid. Shortly after, on February 3, 2025, Elon Musk announced that he and Trump were in the process of permanently shutting down USAID. Employees told CNN they had been asked not to come in.An email said: “At the direction of Agency leadership, the USAID headquarters at the Ronald Reagan building in Washington, D.C. will be closed to Agency personnel on Monday, February 3, 2025. Agency personnel normally assigned to work at USAID headquarters will work remotely tomorrow, with the exception of personnel with essential on-site and building maintenance functions individually contacted by senior leadership.”It all started with a flurry of tweets. Musk didn’t mince words when he labeled USAID a ""criminal organization""—a statement that would be laughable if it weren’t backed by the full-throated support of President Trump himself, who chimed in by calling the agency ""run by radical lunatics."" The bromance between Musk and Trump has gone from casual flirting to full-blown government demolition derby. Trump’s given Musk unprecedented influence over federal agencies through the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), an Orwellian-sounding entity that seems less about efficiency and more about evisceration.Musk’s rationale is simple. He views USAID as a bloated relic of the Cold War, an expensive tool for foreign meddling that masquerades as humanitarian assistance. To Musk, it’s not about saving lives; it’s about saving taxpayer dollars, and to limit the US from endless manipulation. It’s a view shared by certain technocrats in Trump’s inner circles: people like David Sacks and Marc Andreessen who feel America’s desire to meddle in the world’s affairs, to act like a global policeman ends up hampering the country.Founded in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy, USAID was supposed to be America’s way of spreading democracy, freedom, and capitalism—through food, medicine, and a sprinkle of good old-fashioned propaganda. But while its mission statement reads like a Miss Universe contestant’s speech about world peace, USAID has long been accused of being less about aid and more about influence.Critics argue that USAID is the velvet glove covering the iron fist of US foreign policy. It funds NGOs, civil society organizations, and media outlets that align with American interests. In countries where military intervention would be too messy or too obvious, USAID steps in to ""promote democracy,"" which often translates to ""support governments we like and undermine those we don’t."" From funding anti-Castro dissidents in Cuba to allegedly backing opposition groups in Russia and meddling in Ukraine’s political landscape, USAID has a history of blurring the lines between charity and covert ops.According to Mike Benz, a former State Department official and current Executive Director of the Foundation for Freedom Online, USAID isn’t just another aid agency—it’s the linchpin of America's empire. ""This describes our trifecta of foreign policy establishments,"" Benz explains, referencing the State Department, the Department of Defense (Pentagon), and the Intelligence Community. These entities, he argues, manage America’s global empire, overseeing vassal states and foreign markets.The problem? They were all tripping over each other—until USAID came along.Benz claims that USAID was created to streamline the chaos, acting as the ""central hub"" coordinating US foreign influence. ""When people hear the name USAID, they focus on aid. But it’s not about aid. It’s about capacity building—developing institutions in foreign countries to align with U.S. interests,"" he says. According to Benz, USAID serves as the connective tissue between America’s military, diplomatic, and intelligence efforts abroad, channeling billions of dollars into foreign countries to influence their political and economic landscapes. ""It’s not a charity. It’s an empire management tool.""Of course, not everyone’s cheering on Musk and Trump’s bureaucratic bonfire. Critics from both sides of the aisle argue that gutting USAID would be a geopolitical blunder of epic proportions. Democratic Senator Chris Murphy called it ""the total destruction of an agency that has saved countless lives and advanced American interests for decades."" Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez took it a step further, warning, ""Having an unelected billionaire, with his own foreign debts and motives, raiding US classified information is a grave threat to national security.""Even some Republicans are squirming. For all the MAGA bravado, USAID has been a critical tool in stabilizing regions where instability breeds terrorism. No USAID means no soft power, and no soft power means more boots on the ground when things go south. It’s a trade-off that even the most hawkish conservatives are hesitant to make.USAID has been America’s silent partner in world domination—less dramatic than military interventions but often more effective. It’s the sugar that helps the imperial medicine go down. Through development programs, disaster relief, and economic aid, USAID has built alliances, opened markets, and kept fragile governments from collapsing into chaos.Consider Afghanistan. Post-9/11, USAID wasn’t just handing out food; it was building schools, funding local media, and propping up a government friendly to US interests. In Ukraine, USAID-supported NGOs helped shape the political landscape after the 2014 revolution. Even in places like Africa, where aid is framed as purely humanitarian, the subtext is clear: win hearts and minds, keep China at bay.Which brings us to the elephant—or rather, the dragon—in the room: China. While Musk and Trump are busy dismantling USAID, Beijing is quietly expanding its Belt and Road Initiative, signing infrastructure deals, and handing out loans with zero lectures about democracy or human rights. Where USAID withdraws, China steps in, offering an alternative model of development without the messy strings of political reform.The geopolitical implications are staggering. Without USAID, America loses its soft power advantage, ceding influence in Africa, Asia, and Latin America to a country that’s playing the long game. China doesn’t need to invade; it just needs to invest. And while Musk dreams of Mars and Trump dreams of expansion, Xi Jinping is busy reshaping the global order one port, one road, and one ""no-strings-attached"" loan at a time.The crusade against USAID isn’t just about cutting government fat. It’s about reshaping America’s role in the world. Musk and Trump see an empire in decline and believe the solution is to pull back, cut costs, and let the chips fall where they may. But in the zero-sum game of global politics, every vacuum America leaves will be filled—by China, Russia, or anyone else willing to play the long game. In the end, the question isn’t whether USAID is perfect (it’s not). The question is whether America can afford to abandon the very tools that made it a superpower without firing a shot. And if Musk and Trump have their way, we’re about to find out.","The United States Agency for International Development, or USAID, was founded in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy.

Mulino pushes back, says sovereignty “not in question”

US secretary of state Marco Rubio warned Panama’s President José Raúl Mulino on Sunday to reduce China’s influence over the Canal area or face ""measures necessary"" to protect its rights of Americans under the treaty.Rubio’s message, delivered during his first foreign trip as secretary of state, reflects President Donald Trump’s demand for greater US control over the vital trade waterway.Rubio reportedly told Mulino that China’s growing presence in the canal area could violate the 1977 Panama Canal Treaty, which ensured neutrality and free passage for global trade.According to a state department summary, Rubio made it clear that the current status quo is “unacceptable” and that the US could take “measures necessary” to protect its interests, reported the news agency AFP.Panama took full control of the canal in 1999 under the treaty signed by former US President Jimmy Carter. However, Trump has repeatedly questioned whether the US should reclaim authority over the canal, calling it a strategic asset vital to American security.Despite Rubio’s strong message, Mulino downplayed the threat, saying the talks were “respectful” and “positive”. He insisted that Panama’s sovereignty over the canal remains intact, though he acknowledged US concerns by ordering an audit of the Hong Kong-based company Hutchison Ports , which operates ports on both sides of the canal, according to the news agency AFP.Mulino also confirmed that Panama would not renew its Belt and Road Initiative agreement with China once it expires, signalling a possible shift away from Chinese influence .Rubio’s visit sparked anti-US protests in Panama City, where 200 demonstrators gathered, chanting “Marco Rubio out of Panama” and “One territory, one flag”. Protesters burned an effigy of Rubio, along with a banner featuring Trump’s image. Riot police deployed tear gas to disperse the crowd near the presidential palace.Union leader Saul Mendez slammed the US pressure, saying, “We reiterate that there is absolutely nothing here for Trump. Panama is a free and sovereign nation”, as per AFP.Trump, who has placed China at the centre of his foreign policy agenda, has repeatedly claimed that Chinese investments in Panama’s infrastructure could pose a national security risk. Port facilities at both ends of the canal are controlled by Hutchison Ports, a Hong Kong-based company that was recently granted a 25-year no-bid extension.While Mulino has ruled out US control, some analysts believe Panama may consider a compromise, such as transferring canal operations to an American or European company instead of a Chinese one.However, it remains unclear whether Trump would accept such an alternative.Rubio, who will visit El Salvador, Costa Rica, Guatemala, and the Dominican Republic next, is expected to press Latin American leaders on Trump’s key priority—immigration enforcement.He has also approved waivers for some US foreign aid programs, despite the administration’s freeze on funding for Central America.","US secretary of state Marco Rubio warned Panama to reduce China's influence over the Canal area or face'measures necessary' Panama took full control of the canal in 1999 under the treaty signed by former US President Jimmy Carter.

Why did US halt tariffs on Mexico and Canada?



Canada's security commitments

Mexico's military deployment

What about China?

The United States late on Monday paused its planned tariffs on Canada and Mexico for 30 days as both countries take measures to address border security and drug trafficking concerns raised by US President Donald Trump. The decision follows negotiations between the leaders of the three countries and agreements on new security measures.Trump announced the temporary suspension, saying, “I am very pleased with this initial outcome, and the Tariffs announced on Saturday will be paused for a 30 day period to see whether or not a final Economic deal with Canada can be structured.

Canada will invest $200 million to support these efforts.Trump also announced a similar 30-day pause on tariffs for Mexico after a conversation with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum. Under the agreement, Mexico will deploy 10,000 soldiers to the US-Mexico border to curb fentanyl smuggling and illegal migration while officials continue discussions.Although the tariff suspensions provide temporary relief, the situation remains uncertain. Trump has indicated that the tariffs could be reinstated if no final agreements are reached. Meanwhile, a 10 per cent tariff on China remains scheduled to take effect on Tuesday, with Trump expected to discuss the issue with Chinese President Xi Jinping in the coming days.Meanwhile, Trump indicated that more import taxes could be coming against China: ""If we can't make a deal with China, then the tariffs will be very, very substantial,"" he told reporters gathered on Monday.","The United States has paused its planned tariffs on Canada and Mexico for 30 days.

A US military plane is deporting migrants to India, marking President Donald Trump's first crackdown on Indian immigrants after assuming office, Reuters reported quoting an official on Monday.The official confirmed that a C-17 aircraft carrying migrants had departed for India but is not expected to arrive for at least 24 hours.The Pentagon has begun deporting over 5,000 immigrants detained in El Paso, Texas, and San Diego, California, using military flights. So far, the military aircraft have transported migrants to Guatemala, Peru, and Honduras.Military deportation flights come at a high cost, with a recent flight to Guatemala estimated to have cost at least $4,675 per migrant, according to a Reuters report.The Indian government has signaled its willingness to cooperate with the Trump administration in identifying and repatriating its citizens residing illegally in the US, aiming to maintain strong ties and avoid a trade conflict.""We are against illegal immigration, especially because it is linked to several forms of organised crime,"" MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal had said last month.""For Indians not just in the United States, but anywhere in the world, if they are Indian nationals and they are overstaying, or they are in a particular country without proper documentation, we will take them back, provided documents are shared with us so that we can verify their nationality and that they are indeed Indians. If that happens to be the case, we will take things forward and facilitate their return to India,"" he added.According to sources familiar with the matter, both nations have identified approximately 18,000 illegal Indian migrants for deportation, though the actual number could be significantly higher, as the total remains uncertain, Bloomberg had reported last month.India accounts for a relatively small share of illegal migration to the US, with its citizens making up about 3% of all unlawful crossings in fiscal 2024, according to US customs and border protection data.In contrast, Latin American nations like Mexico, Venezuela, and Guatemala contribute a much larger portion. However, the number of Indian illegal migrants has been steadily increasing, particularly at the northern US border, where they now represent nearly a quarter of all illegal crossings—the highest among migrants stopped at that entry point.While the exact total remains uncertain, a 2022 department of homeland security report estimated that approximately 2,20,000 unauthorized Indian immigrants were residing in the US.","The Pentagon has begun deporting over 5,000 immigrants detained in El Paso, Texas, and San Diego, California, using military flights.

Trade war averted? Well, for now

The decision comes as both countries took steps to address his concerns about border security and drug trafficking.The pause follows days of uncertainty that raised fears of a trade war in North America. Such a conflict could have slowed economic growth, increased prices, and strained key trade relationships.Trump announced on social media, “I am very pleased with this initial outcome, and the Tariffs announced on Saturday will be paused for a 30 day period to see whether or not a final Economic deal with Canada can be structured. FAIRNESS FOR ALL!”Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau confirmed the pause on X, saying that Canada will take several measures, including appointing a fentanyl czar, designating Mexican cartels as terrorist organizations, and launching a joint task force with the US to combat organized crime, fentanyl, and money laundering.Mexico has also reached a similar understanding with the US. The pause allows time for negotiations on drug smuggling and illegal immigration. Meanwhile, the 10 per cent tariff on Chinese imports remains in place, with Trump expected to speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping soon.While the immediate risk of a trade war has eased, uncertainty remains. Trump could reintroduce tariffs, and he is also preparing to announce tariffs on imports from the European Union.On Saturday, Trump had directed 25 per cent tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada and a separate 10 per cent tariff on Canadian oil, natural gas, and electricity. Though he had previously indicated these actions, they still surprised investors, businesses, and lawmakers.Analysts suggested that the tariffs could slow economic growth, reduce incomes, and raise prices. However, Trump defended them as necessary to address illegal immigration, drug smuggling, and what he sees as unfair treatment of the USTrump and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum announced the pause after what Trump called a “very friendly conversation.”He added, “I look forward to participating in those negotiations, with President Sheinbaum, as we attempt to achieve a ‘deal’ between our two Countries.”",US President Donald Trump agreed on Monday to pause his planned tariffs on Mexico and Canada for 30 days.

They were referred to as kids as all of them are under 30 with backgrounds in tech, Bloomberg News reported identifying them as Luke Farritor, Edward Coristine, Jeremy Lewin and Gavin Kliger.On Saturday, they requested to enter a highly secure room as they visited several floors and searched desks. The secure room, called a secure compartmented information facility or SCIF is located on the second floor of the Reagan Building. The documents they were seeking were not classified but entry to SCIF requires security clearance.The report said one of the ""DOGE kids"" made a call to Elon Musk who informed the agency's security officials that he would involve the US Marshals Service if his team wasn't given access. Following this, they received access to what they were looking for but that was no secret information, Trump team's Katie Miller said.Acting DC attorney ED Martin wrote a letter to Elon Musk that Musk acknowledged on X hinting that he worked with the DOGE team this weekend.

What we know about US sovereign wealth fund



Treasury secretary Scott Bessent and commerce secretary Howard Lutnick are in charge of laying the groundwork for creating the fund, which would likely require congressional approval.

The fund will be opened within the next 12 months, Lutnick said. The fund could also enable the government to take a profit-earning stake in vaccine manufacturers.

TikTok is one of the options the fund could do. “We might put that in the sovereign wealth fund, whatever we make or we do a partnership with very wealthy people, a lot of options,"" Trump said.

Former president Joe Biden had studied the possibility of creating such a fund for national security investments but it did not materialize.

President Donald Trump signed an executive order Monday to create a sovereign wealth fund, the first ever for the country. At the presser, he hinted that the money may be used to buy TikTok with it. A sovereign wealth fund is a state-owned investment fund comprising assets like stocks, bonds, property, or other financial assets -- meant for use to invest in highways, airports, manufacturing hubs, medical research etc. Norway's Government Pension Fund Global, Abu Dhabi's Investment Authority, Singapore's Temasek Holdings and GIC are some of the examples of sovereign wealth fund.""We're going to stand this thing up within the next 12 months. We're going to monetize the asset side of the U.S. balance sheet for the American people,"" he told reporters. ""There'll be a combination of liquid assets, assets that we have in this country as we work to bring them out for the American people.""The Sovereign Wealth Fund was Trump's election promise which he said could fund great national endeavors. Trump had said during the campaign at the Economic Club of New York that the money would be brought in through tariffs and “other intelligent things.”TikTok was briefly taken down as the law requires its Chinese owner ByteDance to either sell it to an American owner or face a ban. The law came into effect on January 19. But Trump as he took office on January 20 signed an executive order seeking to delay the TikTok ban in the country by 75 days. Trump said he was in talks with several people over TikTok's purchase and the US government would be able to take a decision about TikTok's future in February.","Sovereign wealth fund is a state-owned investment fund comprising assets like stocks, bonds, property, or other financial assets.

PESHAWAR: The Pakistani Taliban claimed the killing of a police officer as he travelled Monday to guard polio vaccinators on the first day of a nationwide immunisation effort after a year of rising cases.The officer was travelling to guard polio vaccinators in the area of Jamrud town in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province when he was killed, local police official Zarmat Khan told AFP.""Two motorcycle riders opened fire on him,"" he said. ""The constable died instantly at the scene."" Pakistan and neighbouring Afghanistan are the only countries where polio is endemic and militants have for decades targeted vaccination teams and their security escorts.The Pakistani Taliban in a statement claimed responsibility for the ""targeted attack"" and said militants also ""seized"" the slain officer's weapon.Pakistan reported at least 73 polio infections in 2024, compared to just six cases in 2023. The vaccination campaign which started on Monday is the first of the year and is due to last a week.""Despite the incident, the polio vaccination drive in the area remains ongoing,"" Khan said.Abdul Hameed Afridi, another senior police official in the area, also confirmed details of the attack and said officers have ""launched an investigation"".Prime minister Shehbaz Sharif acknowledged the violence in a statement from his office, saying ""the anti-polio campaign will continue with full vigour"".Polio can easily be prevented by the oral administration of a few drops of vaccine, but scores of vaccination workers and their escorts have been killed over the years.In the past, clerics falsely claimed that the vaccine contained pork or alcohol, declaring it forbidden for Muslims.In more recent years the attacks have focused on vulnerable police escorts accompanying the vaccinators as they go door-to-door.Last year, dozens of Pakistani policemen who accompany medical teams on campaigns went on strike after a string of militant attacks targeting them.Pakistan has witnessed rising militant attacks since the Taliban returned to power in neighbouring Afghanistan.More than 1,600 people were killed in 2024, the deadliest year in almost a decade, according to the center for research and security studies, an Islamabad-based analysis group.Islamabad accuses Kabul's new rulers of failing to rout militants organising on Afghan soil, a charge the Taliban government routinely denies.In November, at least seven people including five children were killed in a bombing targeting police gathered to guard vaccinators near a school in southwestern Balochistan province.Balochistan, which also neighbours Afghanistan, was the area with the largest number of polio cases in 2024, despite being the most sparsely populated.",The officer was travelling to guard polio vaccinators in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

Pakistani troops fought insurgents who set up roadblocks in the restive northwestern region of Balochistan, leaving 18 paramilitaries and 23 rebels dead, officials said on Saturday. Three other Pakistani soldiers were seriously wounded in some of the heaviest clashes in recent years.The onslaught was claimed by the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), a militant organization behind rising violence in the Balochistan province that borders Afghanistan and Iran.A vehicle carrying unarmed border troops ""came under gunfire from 70 to 80 armed assailants who had blocked the road,"" a police official told the AFP news agency. The official was speaking on the condition of anonymity.The Pakistani military said the casualties occurred after troops engaged the insurgents who erected barricades on a key highway in Kalat, near the border with Afghanistan.The security forces ""successfully removed the roadblock"" following the overnight clashes, the military said in a statement.The military confirmed 18 soldiers died in the operation and vowed that ""the perpetrators, facilitators and abettors of this heinous and cowardly act, will be brought to justice.""

In Pakistan, such efforts are viewed as attempts to fragment the nation — while in Iran the situation is further complicated by the Baloch being a Sunni Muslim minority in a predominantly Shiite country.The largest Baloch militant group, the BLA, is backed by the Pakistani Taliban, also known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).The TTP are a separate group from the BLA, with the TTP being allied with the Afghan Taliban.Balochistan is rich in natural resources such as gold, diamonds, silver, and copper — yet the local population remains among the poorest in Pakistan.","Pakistani troops fight insurgents who set up roadblocks in restive northwestern region of Balochistan. 18 paramilitaries and 23 rebels dead, three other Pakistani soldiers seriously wounded in some of the heaviest clashes in recent years.

Bilal Shabbir, Kalat’s deputy commissioner, said the attacks took place in Pidrang, Khazeni and Mangochar Bazaar areas of the town, where militants started conducting snap checks of passenger vehicles passing through town.In the first incident, Shabbir said a van carrying 17 soldiers from Panjgur to Quetta came under attack near the mountainous area of Khazeni, where armed men battled the security forces. He said one soldier of the Frontier Corps (FC), a paramilitary force, was separately killed in clashes with the militants.“The bodies of the slain soldiers were shifted to Quetta,” Shabbir said. “We don’t know how many attackers were killed because they took the bodies of their fighters into the mountains in the dark.”He said three FC personnel were also injured in the attack, adding that militants set a private bank on fire in Mangochar Bazaar.Separatist groups like BLA have long been at the forefront of a low-level insurgency in Balochistan, Pakistan's largest province by area and rich in mineral resources.

US policy shift and review timeline



Economic and social consequences for Pakistan



Geopolitical ramifications



Uncertain future for development initiatives



NEW DELHI: Donald Trump has temporarily suspended United States foreign assistance to foreign countries, including Pakistan, for re-evaluation, putting several critical development projects on hold.The decision follows an executive order issued by President Donald Trump, directing a comprehensive review of US foreign aid spending.The US aid suspension is set to impact several key sectors in Pakistan, including energy, economic growth, agriculture, governance, education, health, and cultural preservation. Projects such as the Power Sector Improvement Activity, Pakistan Private Sector Energy Initiative, and Clean Energy Loan Portfolio Guarantee Program face disruptions in the energy sector, as per a Geo news report.Economic growth initiatives, including the Social Protection Activity and Pakistan Private Investment Initiative, may also suffer setbacks. In agriculture, programmes like Water Management for Enhanced Productivity and Recharge Pakistan risk losing funding.The suspension has stalled numerous USAID-funded projects across various sectors, including health, education, agriculture, energy, and governance. The move halts initiatives such as the Ambassadors Fund for Cultural Preservation (AFCP), the Power Sector Improvement Activity, and the Pakistan Private Sector Energy Activity. Economic growth initiatives, such as the Social Protection Activity and Investment Promotion Activity, are also affected.In the education sector, projects aimed at improving girls' education, strengthening higher education systems, and enhancing resilience in Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have been disrupted. The health sector has also taken a hit, with the suspension of tuberculosis treatment programmes, family health initiatives, and global health security efforts.Tammy Bruce, a spokesperson for the US Department of State, confirmed that all foreign aid funded by the State Department and USAID is under review. Secretary of State Marco Rubio justified the move, stating that every aid dollar must contribute to American security, strength, and prosperity.The White House has clarified that the suspension is temporary, with a 90-day review period. The final decision will be made by the relevant departments in consultation with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).The suspension of aid threatens Pakistan’s development trajectory, particularly in regions relying on US-funded initiatives for stability and growth. The decision could delay infrastructural advancements, limit economic opportunities, and disrupt healthcare access for vulnerable populations.Pakistan’s governance and democracy-building programmes are also affected, including projects on electoral reforms, land registration, and local governance. The decision may weaken institutional development efforts and impede progress in human rights and civic participation.The suspension highlights a shift in US-Pakistan relations , with Washington reassessing its financial commitments to Islamabad. Analysts believe this could push Pakistan to seek alternative funding sources, possibly from China or Gulf nations, altering its geopolitical alliances.While the pause in aid does not signify a complete severance of US-Pakistan ties, it raises concerns about future diplomatic engagements and financial support from Washington. The upcoming review will determine whether these programmes will resume, be modified, or face permanent cuts.With crucial projects now in limbo, Pakistani officials and aid-dependent communities await the US review’s outcome. The next three months will be critical in determining whether Washington reinstates its financial commitments or signals a long-term reduction in aid to Pakistan.For now, the suspension leaves Pakistan navigating an uncertain future, with potential setbacks in economic growth, infrastructure development, and humanitarian assistance.","Donald Trump has temporarily suspended United States foreign assistance to foreign countries, including Pakistan.

LONDON: Baloch leader Hyrbyair Marri brought attention to the ongoing horrors that the Pashtun and Baloch communities endure under Pakistan 's repressive control in a stirring statement to the Pashtun National Council (Jirga). Marri brought attention to the Pakiststate's systematic exploitation, enforced disappearances, and violence against various ethnic communities.""The sufferings of the Baloch and Pashtun under Pakistan's occupation are countless and unending,"" Marri stated, emphasizing the urgent need for unity between the two nations to resist colonial oppression.He recalled previous instances of solidarity, such as the treaty of kalat in 1758, in which Afghan and Baloch leaders promised to respect and support one another. He asked both groups to rekindle this spirit in their struggle for independence.Marri compared British imperialism to the colonial strategies that Pakistan acquired. He denounced Pakistan's continuous military actions in Balochistan , pointing to unlawful executions, torture, and enforced disappearances as means of quelling dissent. The Baloch leader cited the targeted profiling of Pashtuns and killings like the 1948 Barbra event in Charsadda, claiming that these practices were continuations of the British heritage of divide and conquer.Recalling how Pashtun tribes were utilized as frontline combatants in 1948 while Punjabi elites remained behind, he also denounced Pakistan's abuse of Baloch and Pashtun youth. He also drew attention to the fact that thousands of Baloch youths were forcibly drafted into the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s and sent to die under pretences of religious salvation.Marri condemned Pakistan's racial profiling of Afghan refugees, primarily Pashtuns, and their forced deportation as a pressure tactic against Afghanistan. ""These people have lived here for generations, yet they are treated as disposable,"" he said.Calling for a renewed alliance between the Baloch and Pashtun nations, Marri declared, ""Our unity is the path to freedom.

Pakistan: Four Men Sentenced to Death in Pakistan on Blasphemy Charges,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/four-men-sentenced-to-death-in-pakistan-on-blasphemy-charges/articleshow/117611779.cms,"ISLAMABAD: A Pakistani court has sentenced four men to death on blasphemy charges in the garrison city of Rawalpindi for allegedly uploading sacrilegious content about the Quran and Islamic figures.Tariq Ayub, a judge who awarded the sentence, said the contempt of figures sacred to Muslims and insulting the Quran were unforgivable offences that don’t deserve mercy. He sentenced the four men to death and also fined them 4.6 million Pakistani rupees (approximately $16,000). They were identified as Rana Usman, Ashfaque Ali, Salman Sajjad, and Wajid Ali.According to the court order, dated Jan 24, the four individuals were sentenced to death by hanging for using derogatory remarks against the Holy Prophet. They were also sentenced to life in prison for defiling the Holy Quran and to 10 years’ imprisonment for deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs. “All the sentences shall run concurrently,” the order read.The prosecution lawyer said the case was supported by forensic evidence from the devices used. The men’s lawyer, Manzoor Rahmani, criticised the court’s order, saying doubts and uncertainties that arise in such cases are ignored by the courts, likely due to fear of a religious backlash and potential mob violence against the judge if the accused is acquitted.“We are preparing our appeals against the decision and will go to the high court,” Rahmani said. A member of a support group formed by the families of the accused was quoted by media as saying the pattern of arrests and prosecutions in this case was consistent with previous ones.“We urge the government to establish a commission to investigate the rise in these cases before these young individuals spend the best years of their lives behind bars,” said the support group member.Critics say blasphemy accusations, whether true or false, often lead to lengthy prison sentences on death row and solitary confinement. The laws, according to them, are often abused to settle scores or used to target members of Pakistan’s religious minorities.Hundreds of people have been accused of blasphemy since the draconian laws were introduced by former dictator Gen Zia-ul-Haq in the 1980s. Nearly 100 people have been reportedly lynched to death so far while dozens remain on death row.",A Pakistani court has sentenced four men to death on blasphemy charges. The men were accused of uploading sacrilegious content about the Quran and Islamic figures. They were also sentenced to life in prison for defiling the Holy Quran and to 10 years’ imprisonment.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117611764,imgsize-811335,width-400,resizemode-4/117611764.jpg"

COLOMBO: Sri Lanka announced the lifting of a five-year ban on vehicle imports Tuesday as the country showed further signs of emerging from its worst economic meltdown.Information minister Nalinda Jayatissa said buses, trucks and utility vehicles will be allowed in from Saturday under a phased removal of restrictions in place since 2020.""We are moving very cautiously because we don't want a surge of imports that will deplete our foreign reserves,"" Jayatissa told reporters in Colombo.""Depending on the demand, we will open imports of other categories of vehicles such as cars, motorcycles and three-wheelers.""He said the imports were necessary to generate much-needed tax revenue, and the government hoped to cap imports at about $1.2 billion this year.Current tax rates on vehicles are over 300 per cent.Sri Lanka spent $1.4 billion on vehicle imports in 2019, the last full year before the import ban was imposed in March 2020.The island nation earlier attempted to end the ban on commercial vehicle imports in August 2023, but importers were unable to open letters of credit while the country was still in default on its foreign debt.Sri Lanka formally ended its status as a bankrupt nation in December after securing debt restructuring deals with both bilateral and private creditors.Sri Lanka defaulted on its $46 billion external debt in April 2022 as the country ran out of foreign exchange to finance imports, causing painful shortages of food, fuel and medicines.Months of street protests led to the toppling of then-president Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who was accused of corruption and mismanagement.His successor secured a bailout loan from the international monetary fund , which has said that the South Asian nation is making a recovery but is still not out of the woods.","Buses, trucks and utility vehicles will be allowed in from Saturday under a phased removal of restrictions in place since 2020.

She was confirmed as the WHO Regional Director on January 23, 2024, by the WHO Executive Board in Geneva.However, the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) of Bangladesh is investigating her for alleged corruption charges. An official stated, ""ACC has taken necessary steps to remove Saima Wazed from WHO. All preparations have been finalized to send letters to the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to take measures to remove her.""In August last year, a student-led movement ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina after weeks of protests that resulted in over 600 deaths. Hasina, 76, fled to India, and an interim government led by Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus was formed.Despite the change in government, a lawyer in Dhaka explained, ""If someone elected after a country's nomination to a United Nations body, he or she remains in position in his or her individual capacity, despite the country's government falls.""The political turmoil in Bangladesh has also spilled over to international politics. Recently, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer faced another setback with the resignation of anti-corruption minister Tulip Siddiq . Siddiq, 42, the niece of Sheikh Hasina, was implicated in an embezzlement investigation tied to Bangladesh.Siddiq clarified her position on X, stating, ""An independent review has confirmed that I have not breached the Ministerial Code and there is no evidence to suggest I have acted improperly. Nonetheless, to avoid distraction for the Government, I have resigned as City Minister."" She also explained that her family connections were disclosed, and she recused herself from matters related to Bangladesh to avoid any perception of conflict of interest.Hasina, who fled Bangladesh last year, has been living in India since August 5. The fallout from these events has significantly affected the political landscape in Bangladesh and has drawn international attention. Despite the investigations and political instability, Wazed remains in her position at WHO, as the case continues.","Saima Wazed is a psychologist by training and has worked extensively on neurodevelopmental disorders.

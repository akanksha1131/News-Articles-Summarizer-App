'Terrible helicopter crash in the Hudson River': Trump offers condolences

A helicopter ride over New York City ended in tragedy on Thursday afternoon when a tourist chopper carrying six people broke apart mid-air and crashed into the Hudson River, reports the New York PostThe crash killed everyone on board. The victims included tech executive Agustin Escobar, head of Siemens Spain, his wife, and their three children, who had just landed in the city from Barcelona earlier that day. The pilot, whose identity has not yet been released, also died.Video captured by a bystander and shared with The Post showed the helicopter losing its tail and rotors before slamming into the water, causing a massive splash.The accident unfolded around 3.15 pm near Pier 40, off West Houston Street and West Street. Witnesses say the helicopter appeared to fall apart in the air before plunging like a stone into the icy river.Emergency crews pulled the six victims from the river, four of whom were declared dead at the scene. The remaining two died at the hospital. The New York City fire department (FDNY) confirmed the aircraft had split in half before going down.Officials have launched a full investigation to determine what caused the aircraft to fall apart so suddenly.Bystanders described the scene as the Bell 206L-4 LongRanger IV spiralled out of control.A bystander, Charles McSorley, was walking towards Hoboken from Jersey City when he heard a loud boom and saw the helicopter disintegrating mid-flight.“But you could literally see that the propeller just snapped right off. You can see it snap off, and then it just came straight down,” McSorley told the Post. “It sounded like the helicopter was struggling all of a sudden.”Another witness, Nicholas Bahamonde, was in the middle of a work Zoom call in his Jersey City flat when he saw the tail rotor break off.“I jumped up and I said, ‘Oh my God, there’s a helicopter going down into the Hudson right now.’ I saw it break apart, spiral and crash land into the water very clearly.”Michael Roth, the CEO of New York Helicopter Tours , the company operating the flight, expressed his sorrow, saying he was “devastated” by the crash.“I’m a father and a grandfather and to have children on there, I’m devastated. I’m absolutely devastated,” he told the Post. “I haven’t seen anything like that in my 30 years in the helicopter business.”Roth suggested a possible bird strike or rotor failure could have been the cause of crash but he said that he was not sure. The only thing I could guess – I got no clue – is that it either had a bird strike or the main rotor blades failed. I have no clue. I don’t know.”US President Donald Trump offered condolences in a Truth social post: “Terrible helicopter crash in the Hudson River. Looks like six people, the pilot, two adults, and three children, are no longer with us. The footage of the accident is horrendous. God bless the families and friends of the victims. Secretary of Transportation, Sean Duffy, and his talented staff are on it.”","A tourist helicopter carrying six people broke apart mid-air and crashed into the Hudson River on Thursday afternoon.

Prada to buy Versace for nearly $1.4billion to form an Italian fashion powerhouse,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/prada-to-buy-versace-for-nearly-1-4billion-to-form-an-italian-fashion-powerhouse/articleshow/120184520.cms,"On Thursday, in the biggest luxury deal of the year, Prada announced it was buying Versace for 1.3 billion euros ($1.4 billion) from Capri Holdings, a beleaguered New York group that at one point styled itself as the American answer to the great fashion groups of France.The deal is a sign of faith in the continued value of Made in Italy at a time when financial markets are in chaos because of Trump's policies. And it marks the end of Capri's attempt to create an American luxury group to rival LVMH and Kering, while signaling an attempt by Prada to create an Italian competitor to the powerhouses.Versace will join Prada and Miu Miu, as well as Luna Rossa, America's Cup sailing team, and pastry brand Marchesi as part of Prada Group, creating a ""best in class"" mosaic of Italian savoir-faire. It also gives Prada Group 's fashion holding critical mass, adding a ready-to-wear brand with a different identity to those of Miu Miu and Prada - as well as one that is not dependent on designer Miuccia Prada - to the mix. Prada CEO Andrea Guerra said the acquisition would add, ""a new dimension, different and complementary,"" to the group. ""The journey will be long,"" he added.Prada and Versace are, on the surface, a study in contrasts. Versace made its name on a celebration of flash and fantasy, reveling in sun, sex, the male gaze and the tightrope between bad taste and elegance. Prada, by contrast, embraced a contrarian exploration of the meaning of femininity, gender politics and strange allure of ugly chic. But, Prada chairman Patrizio Bertelli said, ""we share a strong commitment to creativity, craftsmanship and heritage,"" and an understanding of consumer power of brand semiology - the upside triangle, medusa head - and a belief in the importance of family.Miuccia Prada is close to Donatella Versace, who stepped in to run the company her late brother Gianni founded in 1997; though Versace left her position as chief creative officer last month, she is ""delighted' to have her brand back in family hands.","Versace will join Prada and Miu Miu, as well as Luna Rossa, America's Cup sailing team, and pastry brand Marchesi as part of Prada Group.

Panama deal allows US to deploy troops to canal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/panama-deal-allows-us-to-deploy-troops-to-canal/articleshow/120184601.cms,"US and Panamanian military forces conduct a joint drill at the Panama Canal during the visit of US defense secretary Pete Hegseth to Port of Rodman in West Panama, Tuesday, April 8, 2025. (AP)

PANAMA: US troops will be able to deploy to a string of bases along the Panama Canal under a joint deal seen by AFP Thursday, a major concession to President Donald Trump as he seeks to reestablish influence over the vital waterway.The agreement, signed by top security officials from both countries, allows US military personnel to deploy to Panama-controlled facilities for training, exercises and ""other activities.""The deal stops short of allowing the United States to build its own permanent bases on the isthmus, a move that would be deeply unpopular with Panamanians and legally fraught.But it gives the United States broad sway to deploy an unspecified number of personnel to bases, some of which Washington built when it occupied the canal zone decades ago.Trump, since returning to power in January, has repeatedly claimed that China has too much influence over the canal, which handles about 40 percent of US container traffic and five percent of world trade.His administration has vowed to ""take back"" control of the strategic waterway that the United States funded, built and controlled until 1999.The United States has long participated in military exercises in Panama.However, a longer-term rotational force -- such as the one the United States maintains in Darwin, Australia -- could prove politically toxic for Panama's center-right leader Jose Raul Mulino.- 'Country on fire' -Mulino was on Thursday in Peru, where he revealed that the United States had asked to have its own bases.Mulino said he had told visiting Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth that US bases, allowed under an earlier draft, would be ""unacceptable.""He warned Hegseth: ""Do you want to create a mess, what we've put in place here would set the country on fire.""In the watered-down ""Memorandum of Understanding"", signed by Hegseth and Panama's security chief Frank Abrego Wednesday, Panama won its own concessions.The United States recognized Panama's sovereignty -- not a given following Trump's refusal to rule out an invasion -- and Panama will retain control over any installations.Panama will also have to agree to any deployments.But given Trump's willingness to rip up or rewrite trade deals, treaties and agreements, that might offer little succor to worried Panamanians.The country has a long and difficult relationship with the United States.They have close cultural and economic ties, despite the decades-long US occupation of the canal zone and US invasion 35 years ago to overthrow dictator Manuel Noriega.That invasion killed more than 500 Panamanians and razed parts of the capital.Trump vow to take back the canal, and his claim of Chinese influence have prompted mass demonstrations.By law, Panama operates the canal giving access to all nations.But the US president has zeroed in on the role of a Hong Kong company that has operated ports at either end of the canal linking the Atlantic and Pacific oceans for decades.Under pressure from the White House, Panama has accused the Panama Ports Company of failing to meet its contractual obligations and pushed for the firm to pull out of the country.The ports' parent company CK Hutchison announced last month a deal to offload 43 ports in 23 countries -- including its two on the Panama Canal -- to a consortium led by US asset manager BlackRock for $19 billion in cash.A furious Beijing has since announced an antitrust review of the deal.",US troops will be able to deploy to a string of bases along the Panama Canal.

Why Indian-origin FBI director Kash Patel was removed as acting ATF chief,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/why-indian-origin-fbi-director-kash-patel-was-removed-as-acting-atf-chief/articleshow/120145197.cms,"AP photo

Poll Do you agree with the decision to remove Kash Patel as acting head of the ATF? No, he should have been given more time. Yes, it was the right move.

Why was Kash Patel removed?

While it was not immediately clear why Patel was removed, a justice department official said his removal was not due to poor performance, and that it was a standard interim arrangement until senate-confirmed appointments are made. Spokesperson Harrison Fields said Patel’s time at the ATF was temporary and that he is now “excelling” at the FBI.

Patel was heading both the FBI and ATF, two large and complex agencies. Reports suggest the dual responsibility may have been unmanageable.

They say Patel had only visited ATF headquarters once and was mostly absent from agency matters during his short tenure.

His sudden appointment in February reportedly shocked career staff at ATF. Though he encouraged the agency to focus on violent gang crimes, insiders told Reuters his engagement stopped there.

Indian-origin FBI director Kash Patel has been removed as the acting head of the Bureau of alcohol, tobacco, firearms and explosives (ATF), weeks after being given the post alongside his role as FBI director. The White House confirmed army secretary Daniel Driscoll as his replacement.His removal, though confirmed by the Justice Department , was not officially announced. According to sources cited by the Associated Press, Patel was ousted in late February, only days after taking the oath of office.In fact, as late as April, Patel was still listed as the ATF’s acting director on the agency’s website and featured in press releases. It wasn’t until this week that senior ATF officials were informed of the leadership change, raising eyebrows over the opaque handling of the matter.Army secretary Daniel Driscoll has now taken over as acting head of the ATF, while continuing in his existing role blurring the traditional line between defence and domestic law enforcement.The ATF handles key responsibilities such as investigating violent crime, gun trafficking, arson, and bombings, and plays a technical role in tracing firearms used in crimes.","Indian-origin FBI director Kash Patel has been removed as the acting head of the Bureau of alcohol, tobacco, firearms and explosives (ATF) The White House confirmed army secretary Daniel Driscoll as his replacement.

Crackdown on international students sparks legal battle: Universities join fight against Trump admin’s policies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/crackdown-on-international-students-sparks-legal-battle-universities-join-fight-against-trump-admins-policies/articleshow/120160127.cms,"Climate of fear on campus:

Economic and educational fallout:

Global implications:

A call for judicial intervention:

A coalition of leading higher education institutions and academic associations have mounted a significant legal challenge against the Trump administration, denouncing a series of immigration enforcement actions against international students such as visa revocations, and arrests, and also threats to decertify certain educational institutions. These steps they argue have created a ‘climate of fear’ at American colleges and universities.The lawsuit, led by the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) has found support from the Presidents’ Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration (a not for profit representing over 570 college and university leaders) who has filed an amicus brief. In turn, 86 associations and institutions, such as Illinois Institute of Technology, Regis University Rutgers, Georgetown University and others have backed the amicus brief. This brief outlines sweeping consequences for US academia, innovation, and global competitiveness if the Trump administration's approach is allowed to continue.Miriam Feldblum, President and CEO of the Presidents’ Alliance stated: “Recent actions have upended individual lives, undermined the safety of our institutions, and jeopardized academic freedom in and beyond the classroom. The uncertainty generated by visa revocations and terminations not only has immediate impacts but also threatens our long term ability to recruit, retain, and employ talented individuals from across the globe. In submitting this amicus brief, higher education leaders are coming together to amplify the contributions of noncitizen students and scholars, whose ideas and breakthroughs fuel our economy and uphold the collaborative spirit that defines American education.”The amicus brief details chilling examples of federal crackdowns on international students and scholars, many of whom have faced arrest, deportation, or visa cancellations based on suspected political views—particularly pro-Palestinian sentiments. Among the most prominent cases are those of Rümeysa Öztürk, a Turkish Ph.D. student at Tufts University, and Mahmoud Khalil, a recent Columbia University graduate—both arrested without clear links to any misconduct beyond protected political expression. The amicus brief also highlights the case of Ranjani Srinivasan, an Indian citizen and Fulbright recipient attending Columbia’s Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation who self-deported. Quoting media reports, the amicus brief states that as of April 8, the Trump administration has revoked the status of over 500 non-citizens, including many international students, in some cases based on alleged participation in campus activism or social media activity deemed contrary to administration policies. The administration is also terminating the SEVIS student record of the students whose visas it revokes— often without notifying the students' schools or providing any justification. This is a change from prior practice, under which students with revoked entry visas (F-1) retain their status and could remain in the country as long as they were enrolled in study courses. By terminating the students’ SEVIS record, the administration appears to be paving the way to arrest and deport themBeyond civil liberties concerns, the Presidents’ Alliance argues the Trump administration’s policy is devastating to the US economy and higher education system. Over a million international students enrolled in American colleges and universities in 2023, they contributed more than $50 billion to the US economy and supported over 378,000 jobs. As fewer international students come to the US, these economic benefits will begin to disappear. Many also remain in the US after graduation, filling vital roles in STEM industries and contributing to entrepreneurship and innovation.“Over 70% of international Ph.D. students in STEM stay in the US workforce post-graduation,” the amicus brief notes, warning that reduced international enrollment will deprive the country of essential talent and innovation.The chilling effect is already being felt. StudyPortals, a global higher education platform, reports a 42% drop in international interest in US graduate programs since the beginning of 2025. International enrollment agencies in India, China, and other countries report a marked shift in student interest toward Canada, Australia, and the UK. “The US risks losing its position as a global leader in higher education and innovation,” the amicus brief warns.ThePresidents’ Alliance concludes its filing with a call for judicial intervention, urging the court to grant a preliminary injunction against the Trump administration’s enforcement actions and to protect the constitutional rights of students and scholars.","A coalition of leading higher education institutions and academic associations have mounted a significant legal challenge against the Trump administration.

The Insider as Outsider

The Second Lady in the Library

When Usha Vance stood beside her husband on Inauguration Day, watching J.D. Vance take the oath of office as Vice President of the United States, she looked serene. Composed. Unbothered. In a soft pink wool coat, accented with oversized floral earrings and her signature streak of silver hair swept into a bun, she embodied grace under pressure—and quiet resistance in a movement not built for her.It was a striking image. The daughter of Indian immigrants, raised Hindu, now the Second Lady of the United States in the second Trump administration. But while the photos were celebratory, the comment sections told a different story.“Christ is King, not some stinky Indian idol,” one MAGA-aligned user posted. “Will there be a cow in the White House soon?” asked another. The mockery wasn’t about policy. It was about presence. Identity. Faith. Usha knows this. And yet, she remains calm, strategic—and unfazed.Born Usha Chilukuri, she was raised in San Diego, the daughter of two Indian immigrants who arrived in the 1980s to build a better life. Her father was a mechanical engineer. Her mother, a molecular biologist. Usha soared—earning degrees from Yale and Cambridge, editing the Yale Law Journal, and clerking for Chief Justice John Roberts and Judge Brett Kavanaugh.Friends from Yale Law still describe her as “formidable,” “ridiculously intelligent,” and “almost intimidating in her composure.” One classmate noted she could have easily become Solicitor General by 40.Instead, she married J.D. Vance—Marine, author ofand now MAGA’s heir apparent. Their marriage, as one friend put it, is a partnership of “two people who weren’t supposed to meet.” He grew up in a chaotic, working-class household in Middletown, Ohio. She grew up in a quiet, achievement-focused suburb. He arrived at Yale with debt and a chip on his shoulder. She came with impeccable credentials and an instinct to defuse, not escalate.Together, they represent what America often claims to be—but rarely makes space for: pluralistic, post-tribal, unexpectedly united.Indian-Americans, long seen as a “model minority,” had become increasingly visible within conservative circles—sparking admiration and backlash in equal measure. Vivek Ramaswamy had a star turn during the campaign and is now a frontrunner for Governor of Ohio. Kash Patel, Jay Bhattacharya, Sriram Krishnan, and even Tulsi Gabbard (an honorary desi in the eyes of many) now hold influential positions in the administration.And yet, the resentment remains palpable. MAGA’s evangelical wing bristles at non-Christian figures shaping policy. Anti-immigration voices frame Indian-American technocrats as elitist interlopers. What began as admiration for their credentials has curdled into suspicion. Some far-right commentators have even described it as “an invasion by tech elites.”In her first interview as Second Lady, she addressed the online racism that spiked after a 25-year-old Indian engineer tried to popularise the phrase “normalize Indian hate”—and was later rehired by Elon Musk, reportedly at J.D. Vance’s urging. “Do I think it’s great when people talk about ‘normalising Indian hate’? Absolutely not. I think it’s terrible,” she told The Free Press. Still, she stopped short of a sweeping indictment. “I think it’s our relationship to this information… that is potentially new,” she said. “Very, very intelligent people say things that are sometimes very, very ill-founded because we are now in this world in which all conversations happen based on limited information very quickly.” It was a shift in frame—from hate to media structure, from bigotry to the digital churn. The pivot was subtle, but telling.Much of Usha’s public role is shaped by absence—by what she doesn’t say, doesn’t do, doesn’t signal. But in that same interview, she offered a glimpse into the private realities of life beside one of the most polarising men in American politics. “I don’t know that he’s asking me for advice so much as, it can be a very lonely, lonely world not to share with someone,” she said. This, more than anything, sketches the emotional architecture of the Vance marriage: two people who are insiders and outsiders, bound by love and by a shared sense of remove. Their intimacy is not forged through political alliance, but through existential oddity. “There are plenty of people who caricature others on the right,” she added. “It’s really easy to do that.” Empathy, in Usha’s world, is a strategic posture—but not an insincere one.Asked what it feels like to be a brown woman in a world of blondes, Botox, and Fox News glam, Usha responds with characteristic restraint. “It would be really hard for me to be blonde,” she joked. “That colour would look totally absurd.” She lets her hair go grey. She doesn’t use a stylist. She’s not concerned with optics. “For what it’s worth,” she added, “my reception into this world… has been really positive.” Whether that’s wholly true or simply the truth she chooses to see is unclear. But it speaks to her method: focus on the humanity in front of you, not the hostility behind the screen.What makes Usha Vance so effective—and so difficult to categorise—is that she never argues. She simply exists. She wears a sari to the inauguration and offers no explanation. She introduces her husband at the Republican National Convention without leaning into jingoism or affect. She raises three children in a fortress on a hill and insists on reading physical books.At the moment, she’s reading, by Colm Tóibín—a novel about an Irish immigrant woman torn between two countries, two selves.The metaphor is hard to miss. Usha Vance isn’t fighting MAGA’s culture war. She’s refusing to be defined by it.Political scientist Paul Sracic once remarked: “It’s difficult to accuse Vance of being sympathetic to white nationalists when his wife is Indian American and his children are Indian American. That insulates him from that attack.” That may be true. But Usha’s role isn’t merely to insulate. It’s to complicate the narrative.She’s the insider who can’t quite belong. The immigrant daughter who rarely speaks about immigration. The Hindu woman whose gods remain suspect in a movement still centred around Christian nationalism. When asked what the media gets wrong about her husband, she doesn’t bristle. “There are lots of people who have just imagined all sorts of narratives about us,” she said. “To me, the highest priority right now is to be actually a normal person.” It’s a goal that politics rarely permits—and that MAGA, with its appetite for spectacle, may never truly understand.Each morning, Usha Vance reads in the green-painted library of the vice president’s residence. There’s a fireplace. Silence. A kind of enforced stillness. Her children—Ewan, Vivek, and Mirabel—race through the halls above. “One of the ways to counteract [this world] is to read paper books,” she told The Free Press. As if turning pages could buffer a person from the chaos just outside the door. It’s a lonely place to be normal. But Usha Vance is very good at being alone in plain sight.","Indian-Americans, long seen as a “model minority,” had become increasingly visible within conservative circles.

In 2025, the world's richest people are more and more concentrated in a handful of select cities, with New York City taking the lead. These cities not only show the growing power of technology and finance but also indicate the major role of AI and informatics in generating new wealth. According to Forbes reports, almost 25% of the world's 3,028 billionaires reside in just 10 cities, and these billionaires together possess an astonishing $3.3 trillion in assets.New York City is still the world's foremost concentration of billionaires, with 123 billionaires and a collective net worth of an astonishing $759 billion. The city has dominated the top position for almost all of the last twelve years, with 2021 being the only exception where Beijing took the lead for a brief period. Most of New York's billionaires made their money in finance, investing, real estate, and fashion. With 68 billionaires in finance alone, NYC's financial sector dominance is unparalleled.Some notable new additions to NYC are:Moscow has witnessed the most profound expansion in residents who are billionaires, growing by 16 billionaires to a total of 90. This expansion takes Moscow to surpass Hong Kong and firmly take second position. Moscow's increase in total wealth stands at $409 billion and is mainly brought about by the explosion in the oil and manufacturing sectors, catapulting the fortunes of its inhabitants.The wealthiest citizen, Vagit Alekperov, has a net worth of $28.7 billion, and the top newcomers are:In spite of a small decline in the number of billionaires (down by 2), Hong Kong remains a major player with 72 billionaires and a total wealth of $309 billion. Hong Kong continues to draw tech billionaires and finance oligarchs, ranking among the wealth generation cities. The economic foundation of the city has diversified with the entry of new personalities from the cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence markets, even as the overall number of billionaires declined.Key residents:London, following a few years of decline, has recovered in 2025, adding 9 billionaires to its tally, taking the city's total to 71. With a net worth of $355 billion combined, London has cemented its place as one of the richest cities. The increase is due to an expansion in the investment and tech industries. The wealthiest resident, Len Blavatnik, has a net worth of $29.9 billion.Beijing ranks fifth in 2025 with 68 billionaires and a total wealth of $273 billion. The city is boosted by the fortunes of tech behemoths such as Lei Jun, Xiaomi CEO, whose estimated wealth is $43.5 billion. Even though the general growth is slower, Beijing still generates billionaires due to the real estate and tech sectors.Notable new entries:Mumbai fell two places to sixth position, with 67 billionaires whose net worth is $349 billion. Even as it fell, the city remains an economic force to be reckoned with. The city's technology, energy, and property industries contribute to the billionaires' wealth. Mukesh Ambani is still the richest resident, worth $92.5 billion.Singapore made a big leap, advancing 2 positions with 60 billionaires and $259 billion in total wealth. Singapore's billionaire wealth is dominated by the tech industry, which is headed by ByteDance's Zhang Yiming ($65.5B). Zhang alone is responsible for 25% of the city's overall billionaire wealth.San Francisco and Shanghai tie for the eighth position, both having 58 billionaires. San Francisco has also received a swarm of AI-tech billionaires, with notable ones including Anthropic, the rapidly rising startup, whereas Shanghai remains going strong on tech innovation and e-commerce.Combined wealth in San Francisco is $217 billion and that of Shanghai is $198 billion. Both cities' top inhabitants by net worth are as follows:Los Angeles completes the top 10 with 56 billionaires and a net worth of $243 billion. The billionaires in the city cross industries such as entertainment, technology, and real estate. High-profile inhabitants such as Peter Thiel and celebrities such as Rihanna and LeBron James add to the wealth of the city.Prominent inhabitants:","New York City is still the world's foremost concentration of billionaires, with 123 billionaires and a collective net worth of an astonishing $759 billion.

Pierre Poilievre: 'Hindu-Canadians don’t feel safe': Why many Indo-Canadians are backing Pierre Poilievre,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/hindu-canadians-dont-feel-safe-why-many-indo-canadians-are-backing-pierre-poilievre/articleshow/120164844.cms,"'Groundbreaking news': The Online Backlash



A Diaspora Caught in a Diplomatic Firestorm



Political Allegiances, Community Confusion



The Don Patel Fallout



Influence or Interference?



In April 2022, Conservative leadership contender Pierre Poilievre attended a community event at the Vancouver home of Aditya Tawatia , a realtor and long-time participant in Indo-Canadian civic and political circles. The event, attended by local supporters, was one of many such gatherings on Poilievre’s cross-country campaign tour. Tawatia donated $1,675 to Poilievre’s leadership bid—the maximum allowed under Elections Canada rules—and has since contributed additional funds to the Conservative Party.Tawatia is one of several Indo-Canadian professionals who previously helped establish the Overseas Friends of BJP Canada, a group created in 2014 to support political change in India. While the organisation is no longer active, some of its former leaders remain engaged in Canadian politics and community advocacy, and have supported Poilievre’s leadership and the broader Conservative movement. Their involvement has drawn attention in recent weeks, raising questions about diaspora political activity, foreign influence, and the role of diaspora organisations in Canadian campaigns.A recent Global News piece scrutinised the contributions, suggesting a coordinated effort by former BJP sympathisers to shape Canadian politics. The report raised the spectre of foreign interference, citing the past affiliations of donors who helped set up or participated in BJP-aligned diaspora groups. Yet for critics of the story, the controversy is less about foreign meddling and more about a double standard.Conservative figures and commentators swiftly pushed back. “Canadian citizen who was born in India gave the legal amount for an individual to Pierre Poilievre,” wrote Daniel Bordman . “More groundbreaking news at 11…” Ezra Levant framed the issue more bluntly: “The Conservatives raised $41.7 million in 2024 from over 200,000 donors. One Canadian who is friends with India's PM donated $1,675… That—and not Mark Carney ’s $250 million loan from China—is foreign interference, to Global News.”To supporters of Poilievre — and to many within the Indo-Canadian community — the entire episode reflects a deeper discomfort within Canada’s political and media class: a discomfort with certain immigrant communities being politically active, particularly when their values and affiliations lean right.“This is how democracy works,” said Tawatia to the Globe and Mail. “We are the most patriotic Canadians. We are doing good things for democracy. We like the Conservative Party — so what?”That view is echoed by others formerly involved in diaspora groups aligned with the BJP. They stress that their early work was about rooting out corruption in India’s Congress Party government, not pushing a foreign agenda in Canada. Since then, many have reorganised into domestic community groups focused on Indo-Canadian issues. Several no longer have ties to Indian political parties, but maintain strong views on Canada’s relationship with India and on growing tensions over the Khalistan movement.The renewed spotlight on former Friends of BJP leaders comes at a tense time in Canada-India relations. In June 2023, Sikh terrorist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar was gunned down in the parking lot of a gurdwara in Surrey, B.C. Months later, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau made an explosive statement in Parliament: Canadian intelligence believed the Indian government was involved in the assassination.Indian intelligence reports show that Nijjar was not simply an activist, but had been undergoing arms training in Pakistan under the protection of groups hostile to both India and the West. He was reportedly connected to efforts aimed at reviving Sikh militancy and recruiting for separatist causes from Canadian soil. A Canadian commission report later found no 'definitive link' between any foreign involvement and Nijjar's assassination.The allegations — strongly denied by India — shattered diplomatic relations. Trade talks were suspended. High commissioners were expelled. But in parts of Canada’s Indian diaspora, especially among Hindu-Canadians, Trudeau’s intervention didn’t feel like a defence of sovereignty. It felt like the government was taking sides.“The big challenge we find is the Khalistani element,” said Shiv Bhasker, a former OFBJP official and Poilievre donor who later formed the Overseas Friends of India Canada. Bhasker said his group has lobbied for stronger Indo-Canadian ties and raised concerns about what he described as Khalistan-linked intimidation of Hindu Canadians — including at temples and community events.“Hindu-Canadians don’t feel safe,” he said. “They feel that intelligence agencies and police forces have been compromised, or at least infiltrated by these Khalistan elements.”Not everyone agrees. Balpreet Singh of the World Sikh Organization called the depiction of Khalistan supporters as a threat to national security “a narrative right out of India.” He pointed out that Canada’s RCMP has accused India of serious criminal activity — not the other way around.“The idea that the RCMP is being told what to do by Khalistanis is absurd,” Singh said. “India has engaged in transnational repression here in Canada. That’s what’s at issue.”Caught in the middle of this diplomatic and ideological dispute are Canadian politicians — especially Conservatives, who have been careful in their statements about both India’s conduct and Sikh community concerns.Poilievre has attended multiple community events hosted by former OFBJP organisers. In October 2022 and again in 2023, he spoke at Diwali functions on Parliament Hill co-hosted by Bhasker’s Overseas Friends of India Canada and the Canada India Global Forum — the rebranded version of one of the OFBJP organisations. He sat next to India’s High Commissioner to Canada just weeks after Trudeau’s bombshell Nijjar allegation. A Conservative spokesperson defended the appearances, saying they were community celebrations, not political endorsements.Still, some in the Sikh community view the appearances as tacit approval. “It is really concerning if those are the individuals now donating, promoting, and pushing candidates,” said a spokesperson for the Sikh Federation of Canada. “It suggests a lack of distance between our political class and foreign-linked networks.”Within the Indo-Canadian community itself, opinions are divided. Some, like Bhasker, remain staunchly Conservative and believe the party aligns best with their economic and cultural values. “We don’t believe in handouts,” he said. “We want to work hard. We want lower taxes. We want smaller government.”Others feel let down. Azad Kaushik, another former OFBJP leader who formed the National Alliance of Indo-Canadians, said some recent Conservative candidates appeared sympathetic to Khalistan. “I’m a hardcore Conservative,” he said. “I’ll vote Conservative. But we are not happy.”And then there was Don Patel.In early 2025, the Conservative Party dropped its candidate in Etobicoke North, Don Patel, after he “liked” a social media post that suggested sending Khalistani activists to India for Prime Minister Modi to “take care” of them. His emoji reaction — a heart and a hug — triggered criticism. The party disavowed him, calling the post “clearly unacceptable.”The incident highlighted the minefield the Conservatives now find themselves in. On one hand, they are trying to court a growing base of Indo-Canadian voters who feel disenchanted with the Liberals. On the other hand, they are under pressure to draw a line between cultural solidarity and ethnic nationalism.Tawatia, for one, insists that this is about Canada — not India. “I have so many friends in Toronto who are not Conservative,” he said. “This narrative that we are some kind of foreign influence operation — it’s nonsense.”For now, the debate shows no signs of slowing. Canada has passed legislation to create a foreign agent registry, similar to the US system that governs overseas political activities. But the system is not yet operational. In the meantime, diaspora engagement continues — legally, loudly, and with growing political visibility.The line between engagement and interference remains murky. Some argue it’s a distinction of transparency and intent: donations made openly by Canadian citizens, regardless of heritage, should not be lumped in with covert influence. Others argue the ecosystem of ethnic politics — especially when linked to countries with global ambitions — deserves closer scrutiny.In the end, the controversy surrounding Poilievre’s Indo-Canadian donors may say less about them and more about Canada’s ongoing struggle to reconcile multiculturalism with foreign policy, and diaspora activism with national interest.As one observer put it: “You can’t ask immigrants to integrate and then panic when they participate.”","Conservative leadership contender Pierre Poilievre attended a community event at the Vancouver home of Aditya Tawatia, a realtor and long-time participant in Indo-Canadian civic and political circles.

Trump admin faces deadline on Mahmoud Khalil deportation

Judge asks for more evidence in Mahmoud Khalil case or says it will be dropped

The Trump administration has filed a brief memo in response to an immigration judge ’s request for evidence in its bid to deport Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil .The memo, signed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, argues that Khalil’s continued presence in the US could harm foreign policy objectives, specifically the country’s efforts to combat anti-Semitism. It claims that while Khalil’s activism was lawful, allowing him to stay would undermine policies to protect Jewish students and combat anti-Semitism both in the US and globally.The memo does not accuse Khalil of any criminal activity. Rather, it centers around his pro-Palestinian activism , specifically his role as a spokesperson for protests against Israel’s treatment of Palestinians. Rubio’s submission, filed Wednesday, claims that Khalil's activities, though lawful, threaten US interests. He wrote that condoning Khalil's actions could “severely undermine” US foreign policy goals related to anti-Semitism.Khalil’s attorneys have argued that the Trump administration is attempting to stifle his free speech regarding Palestine. They contend that the government's case against him is baseless. In a statement, lawyers Marc Van Der Hout and Johnny Sinodis declared, “There is not a single shred of proof that Mahmoud’s presence in America poses any threat,” referring to his arrest and detention in Louisiana after being taken from New York in early March.The memo also calls for the deportation of another US permanent resident, though the person’s identity is not disclosed. Despite references in the memo to other supporting documents, including a “subject profile” of Khalil, these have not been submitted to the immigration court.Khalil, who is 30 years old and a Palestinian-born Syrian national, has firmly rejected allegations of anti-Semitism. In a letter from jail, he accused the administration of targeting him as part of a larger effort to suppress dissent. He also expressed his desire to be freed to witness the birth of his first child, noting, “I hope nonetheless to be free to witness the birth of my first-born child.”Meanwhile, the Trump administration has been engaged in a broader campaign against anti-Semitism on university campuses, though critics argue it is an attack on free speech. In recent weeks, the government has withheld funding from universities, demanding they punish protesters and make other changes in exchange for reinstating the funding.Khalil’s case is part of a larger trend where US authorities have revoked visas and taken action against international students and activists critical of Israel or its treatment of Palestinians. Khalil’s lawyers argue that no evidence has been presented linking him to Hamas, a militant group that has been central to the government’s justification for his detention. The latest filing makes no mention of Hamas.In a related case, another Columbia University student, Yunseo Chung, faces similar deportation efforts. Chung, who was arrested during a pro-Palestinian sit-in at Barnard College, is fighting her deportation in court. Her attorneys included Rubio’s letter in court filings, seeking access to any documents that would shed light on the government’s decision to target her for deportation.","The Trump administration has filed a brief memo in response to an immigration judge ’s request for evidence in its bid to deport Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil.

'There will be transition cost': Donald Trump holds ground on tariffs as US markets falter,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/there-will-be-transition-cost-donald-trump-holds-ground-on-tariffs-as-us-markets-falter/articleshow/120185603.cms,"President Donald Trump speaks at a cabinet meeting in the Cabinet Room of the White House, Thursday, April 10, 2025, in Washington. (AP)

US President Donald Trump on Thursday said that his tariff policy would come with a "" transition cost ,"" as markets dropped again due to ongoing uncertainty around the trade conflict.""There will be a transition cost, and transition problems, but in the end, it's going to be a beautiful thing,"" Trump said. The US president is aiming to change the global economy by encouraging manufacturers to operate from the United States.His comment came shortly after the White House said that tariffs on China would rise to 145 per cent on some products. This includes a previous 20 per cent tariff on those making the drug fentanyl.Despite the tensions, Trump said he still hopes to make an agreement with China. ""I think we'll end up working something out that's very good for both countries. I look forward to it,"" he said.Markets continued to show signs of trouble on Friday, after Trump’s earlier announcement of a 10 per cent tariff on all countries except China.On Wednesday afternoon, Trump said that for 90 days, the US would apply a flat 10 per cent tariff on all countries except China, instead of setting different ""reciprocal"" tariffs for each country.Trump also paused a plan to impose tariffs as high as 50 per cent on countries he described as the ""worst offenders."" However, the trade dispute with China remains.Meanwhile, China has increased its retaliatory tariffs on American goods to 84 per cent .In a televised cabinet meeting, Trump said, ""There would always be transition difficulty,"" but added that ""it was the biggest day in history in markets.""He said investors were pleased with how the US was managing its trade policy and that the country was ""trying to get the world to treat us fairly.""He also said, ""everybody wants to come and make a deal"" to lower tariffs.US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick, who was also at the meeting, said several countries were entering talks and bringing ""offers they never would have"" if not for Trump’s trade actions.""We're getting the respect we deserve now,"" Lutnick said. ""I think you're going to see historic deals one after the other.""Moreover, Trump also said the US would ""love to be able to work a deal (with China)"" and added that he had ""great respect for President Xi."" He also said he thought they would ""end up working something out that's very good for both countries.""He repeated his claim that China had ""taken advantage"" and ""ripped off"" the US ""more than anybody"" for a long time.Meanwhile, China announced that it would reduce the number of American-made films in its cinemas. It also said that the trade dispute had lowered interest in Hollywood movies among Chinese audiences.Currently, China allows up to 34 US films each year. Local movies are becoming more popular.The European Union said it would pause its planned countermeasures against the US for 90 days. These were scheduled to start on April 15.On Wednesday, 26 out of 27 EU countries — all except Hungary — voted to apply tariffs in response to the US 20 per cent tariff.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement that the EU wanted ""to give negotiations a chance.""","US President Donald Trump on Thursday said that his tariff policy would come with a "" transition cost,"" as markets dropped again due to ongoing uncertainty around the trade conflict.

Captain Canuck slaps down Trump, Musk in comic inspired by US-Canada trade war

A 1970s comic book hero is experiencing a dramatic resurgence thanks to renewed political tension between Canada and the United States under President Donald Trump Captain Canuck — the crimson-and-white-clad protector of Canadian sovereignty — has emerged as an unlikely cultural symbol in response to Trump’s annexation rhetoric and trade threats.""It's got a lot of Canadians, you know, thinking about their identity as Canadians and feeling more united as Canadians. We feel like, okay, we've got to stand in opposition to these proposals,"" Richard Comely , the 74-year-old co-creator of the character told news agency Reuters.In a bold throwback to classic comic book storytelling, Elon Musk is cast as the loyal sidekick to 'supervillain' Donald Trump — both of whom find themselves on the receiving end of Captain Canuck’s justice. One panel shows the Canadian superhero forcefully intercepting Trump mid-action, while another depicts a dramatic scene of both Trump and Musk being hauled away by the collar, helpless against the red-and-white-clad guardian of Canadian sovereignty.Comely, who first introduced Captain Canuck in 1975, said the current political climate has triggered a wave of national pride. “All of a sudden Canadians are looking to Captain Canuck as a symbol. And it's basically, to them, Captain Canuck symbolizes independence.”Originally designed as a uniquely Canadian counterpart to Captain America, Captain Canuck’s alter ego is Tom Evans, a Mountie whose encounter with aliens granted him superhuman abilities. His costume prominently features maple leaves and the country’s signature red and white colors.“So in a sense, we have Mr. Trump to thank for a bit of resurgence,” Comely added, noting a recent uptick in interest from Canadian companies due to the ongoing cross-border tensions.The latest cover of Captain Canuck’s upcoming 50th anniversary edition features the superhero wagging his finger at Donald Trump — a visual response to the US President’s controversial remarks suggesting Canada should be incorporated as a US state.Comely reflected on the cultural forces that inspired the character’s birth: ""I think there was an undercurrent, so to speak, in Canada in the '70s. So I think Canadians were starting to feel like, you know, like they should acknowledge the fact that we had our own country, and we had our own culture and be proud of the fact that we were Canadians.""Since its debut, the franchise has seen more than 4 million Captain Canuck comic books, graphic novels, and related publications printed across the globe. The journey hasn’t been linear — Comely took a break from the comic world to raise his large family, with a short revival in the 1990s through the “Captain Canuck Reborn” series.In 2012, the character found a new lease on life through an exclusive licensing deal with Chapterhouse Comics . This collaboration launched Captain Canuck into a modern era with animated web series and branded merchandise, cementing his place in contemporary Canadian pop culture.While Captain Canuck’s original narrative envisioned foreign groups attempting to infiltrate and destabilize a powerful Canada, Comely is quick to clarify: “Of course, never, never in any of those stories was it America that was going to be taking over Canada.”Still, the superhero’s resurgence in popularity amid Trump-era politics seems fitting, as Canadians rally around a long-standing fictional icon to express very real sentiments of sovereignty and unity.","Captain Canuck is the red-and-white-clad protector of Canadian sovereignty.

"US deficit hits $1.3 trillion halfway through fiscal 2025, second highest on record",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-deficit-hits-1-3-trillion-halfway-through-fiscal-2025-second-highest-on-record/articleshow/120185364.cms,"Treasury secretary Scott Bessent (AP Photo)

The United States is staring at a ballooning fiscal deficit, with the Treasury Department reporting a shortfall of over $1.3 trillion in just the first six months of fiscal year 2025 — a figure that marks the second-highest midyear deficit in four decades of recordkeeping.This staggering number, spanning the transition from President Joe Biden to President Donald Trump, reflects federal spending from October through March. Only fiscal year 2021 saw a higher six-month deficit — $1.7 trillion — during the peak of COVID-19 emergency spending.Spending has surged across multiple areas, a Treasury official told the Associated Press on condition of anonymity. Contributing factors include elevated Social Security payouts due to cost-of-living adjustments, increased spending on Medicare and Medicaid , disaster relief allocations via FEMA, and heightened expenditures by the Defense Department.Meanwhile, the Trump administration has pointed to its push for fiscal reform through the newly created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by tech billionaire Elon Musk. The agency aims to slash wasteful government spending — though its initial savings estimate of $1 trillion has since been revised downward.Speaking from the Oval Office on Thursday, Musk said, “DOGE expected to achieve $150 billion in savings during the next fiscal year by reducing waste and fraud,” calling such inefficiencies “very common.”The Treasury’s latest figures show government borrowing between January and March rose $41 billion compared to the same stretch in 2024. Federal outlays during the first quarter of 2025 alone jumped $139 billion year-over-year.Republicans in the House have advanced a budget plan that outlines $4.5 trillion in tax cuts while demanding at least $1.5 trillion in spending reductions — proposals that remain divisive even within the party. Some lawmakers are pushing for deeper spending cuts, while others want broader tax relief.DOGE’s blueprint includes laying off a large chunk of the 2.4 million civilian federal employees, scrapping entire agencies such as the Department of Education, and scaling back federal programs.Maya MacGuineas, president of the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget , offered a stark warning: “The numbers are undeniable. We are racking up debt at an alarming pace, and it’s unlikely to end any time soon. In fact, lawmakers seem hellbent on adding to that sum with trillions of unpaid-for tax cuts and spending increases.”She urged a course correction before the situation becomes irreversible. “We need to correct the unsustainable course we are on and start focusing on fixing our nation’s finances before it is too late,” MacGuineas said.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent echoed concerns over the growing deficit earlier this month, telling Bloomberg Television that the US could approach the statutory debt ceiling — or ""X-date"" — as soon as this summer. “We are going to go onto the warning track sometime in May or June,” Bessent noted.","Treasury Department reports a shortfall of over $1.3 trillion in just the first six months of fiscal year 2025.

Judge orders illegals to register with US govt in new immigration crackdown,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/judge-orders-illegals-to-register-with-us-govt-in-new-immigration-crackdown/articleshow/120183893.cms,"AP photo

A federal judge granted the Trump administration another legal victory on Thursday, upholding a requirement that all individuals living in the US illegally must register with the federal government and carry documentation.Judge Trevor Neil McFadden, a Trump appointee, ruled in favor of the administration, asserting that the requirement to register and document was an existing law that applied to everyone in the US who is not a citizen. However, McFadden did not address the substance of the administration’s argument, instead determining that the group challenging the mandate lacked the legal standing to pursue their case.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced that the registration deadline for those who have been in the country for 30 days or more is Friday. DHS emphasized that the requirement would be enforced without exception.""President Trump and I have a clear message for those in our country illegally: leave now,"" DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said. ""If you leave now, you may have the opportunity to return and enjoy our freedom and live the American dream. The Trump administration will enforce all our immigration laws — we will not pick and choose which laws we will enforce. We must know who is in our country for the safety and security of our homeland and all Americans.""The DHS first alerted illegal immigrants about the registration and departure requirement in February, warning that failing to comply would result in serious consequences.The Immigration and Nationality Act , which was passed in 1952, provides tools for tracking illegal immigrants and encouraging voluntary departure. DHS outlined penalties for migrants who fail to register, leave the country, or notify authorities of address changes. Noncompliance could result in fines, imprisonment, or both.This registration requirement applies to all individuals aged 14 and older who do not have legal status in the US It also includes Canadians who have stayed in the US for more than 30 days, including ""snowbirds"" who spend the winter months in states like Florida.While the registration has always been part of US law, it has rarely been enforced in the past. The most notable instance of enforcement occurred after the September 11, 2001, attacks, when a special registration program was implemented for noncitizen males from 25 countries, most of which were Arab or Muslim. Although the program did not lead to terrorism convictions, it resulted in over 13,000 people being placed in deportation proceedings before being suspended in 2011 and fully dissolved in 2016.",Judge Trevor Neil McFadden ruled in favor of the administration. The registration requirement applies to all individuals aged 14 and older who do not have legal status in the US. The deadline for those who have been in the country for 30 days or more is Friday.

A routine sightseeing flight turned tragic Thursday when a helicopter carrying six people nosedived into the Hudson River, sending a terrifying plume of water skyward and leaving no survivors.Startling video footage, captured by a stunned onlooker, showed the moment the New York Helicopter aircraft appeared to break apart in midair before smashing into the frigid waters near Hoboken around 3:20 pm Witnesses were horrified as the chopper’s tail and rotor system seemed to detach just moments before impact.Nicholas Bahamonde, 34, witnessed the devastating moment unfold from his Jersey City apartment.“I look up to the left, and I saw the tail rotor break off of the helicopter, so it was already split in the air, and then the front main part of the helicopter started spiraling into the ocean,” he told New York Post.“I jumped up and I said, ‘Oh my God, there’s a helicopter going down into the Hudson right now.’ And so I got off that and called 911, immediately. But I saw it. I saw it break apart, spiral and crash land into the water like, very clearly.”Bahamonde was in the middle of a work Zoom call when he heard a deafening noise. That bang, it turned out, marked the beginning of the helicopter’s fatal descent.Eyewitness Charles McSorley, 59, was walking between Jersey City and Hoboken when the helicopter caught his attention. What he saw next left him stunned.“Looked like the propellers came straight off. And I saw it come straight down,” he recalled. “And I just started walking fast towards Hoboken because it wasn’t far from the Hoboken train station.”McSorley said there was a sudden shift in the helicopter’s behavior. “But you could literally see that the propeller just snapped right off. You can see it snap off, and then it just came straight down.”“The rotors just ‘snapped right off,’” he added.In another chilling account, Bruce Wall described the final moments before impact, saying, “Just walking toward this way from Hoboken and started just hearing something and then you look to the left into the water and you see the plane slowly falling apart.”“It was falling apart probably 15 feet before it actually fell and then the tail whipped off and the propeller fell while it was falling, crashing, the propeller, as you see in the video, the propeller was in the air still propelling while the plane was falling down.”Authorities later confirmed that the pilot and five tourists from Spain, including three children, were aboard the ill-fated aircraft. Four of the victims were declared dead at the scene, and the remaining two died after being rushed to a nearby hospital.An official investigation has been launched to determine the cause of the crash, though early accounts suggest catastrophic mechanical failure.The video footage of the crash and the consistency of witness statements all point to the same horrifying sequence: the helicopter began to break apart in midair, leaving those on the ground powerless as the chopper spiraled into the Hudson below.","The New York Helicopter aircraft appeared to break apart in midair before smashing into the frigid waters near Hoboken.

U.S. Indo- Pacific Commander Reveals Deep Insights Into US Strategies To Contain China!

Admiral Samuel Paparo , head of the US Indo-Pacific Command , raised alarms on Thursday about China’s intensified military presence around Taiwan, suggesting that recent maneuvers are far more serious than standard drills.""With military pressure against Taiwan increasing by 300%, China's increasingly aggressive actions near Taiwan are not just exercises, they are rehearsals,"" Paparo said while addressing the Senate Armed Services Committee. He described China’s strategic shift as part of a broader modernization effort that threatens not only Taiwan but also US interests and allies across the region.""China's unprecedented aggression and military modernization poses a serious threat to the homeland, our allies and our partners,"" he emphasized, calling attention to the growing regional instability provoked by Beijing’s actions.While Taiwan considers itself an independent, sovereign nation, it is still officially recognized as part of China under the ""One China"" policy — a stance maintained by the United Nations, the US, and China itself. However, tensions continue to rise as Beijing steps up efforts to ""reunify"" Taiwan with the mainland, a goal that both Washington and Taipei have warned would upset the balance in the Indo-Pacific.The admiral pointed out that rather than cowing Taipei into submission, China's aggressive posture is having the opposite effect. ""While the [People’s Liberation Army] PLA attempts to intimidate the people of Taiwan and demonstrate coercive capabilities, these actions are backfiring, drawing increased global attention and accelerating Taiwan's own defense preparations,"" he said.Beyond the Taiwan Strait, Paparo also cautioned lawmakers about the broader implications of China’s accelerating military production. “China's outproducing the United States in air missile, maritime and space capability and accelerating these,"" he stated.He offered a stark comparison, noting that the Chinese military is building fighter jets at a rate 1.2 times that of the United States and is also outpacing the US in the production of naval vessels, advanced missiles, and space technologies. “I remain confident in our deterrence posture, but the trajectory must change,” Paparo concluded, signaling an urgent call for US defense innovation and readiness.","Admiral Samuel Paparo, head of the US Indo-Pacific Command, raised alarms on Thursday about China’s intensified military presence around Taiwan.

Trail of regret: REI retreats from support of Trump’s Interior head Burgum,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trail-of-regret-rei-retreats-from-support-of-trumps-interior-head-burgum/articleshow/120182482.cms,"Mary Beth Laughton

Outdoor retail giant REI has issued a formal apology for endorsing Doug Burgum , President Donald Trump’s pick for Interior Secretary, after mounting criticism over the department’s direction under his leadership.Mary Beth Laughton , REI’s recently appointed president and CEO, acknowledged that the company’s earlier support for Burgum — which came before her tenure — no longer reflects its position. “REI will be a corporate leader in pressuring the Interior Department to be transparent about its decisions involving public lands,” Laughton stated, adding that the company will also urge Congress to stop “the large-scale sell-off” of federal lands.The apology follows significant outcry from environmental groups, which had cautioned against Burgum’s nomination when he was still governor of North Dakota. Critics warned that his business background and political affiliations could lead to the exploitation of public lands in favor of fossil fuel profits.REI had joined a group of organizations in January to endorse Burgum, praising his track record on outdoor recreation. The letter expressed support for his nomination, noting that his “history of support for outdoor recreation, the outdoor recreation economy , and the protection of public lands and waters makes his leadership critical for the Administration and the Department.”Since taking office, Burgum has proposed turning federal lands into sites for affordable housing and has backed Trump's controversial efforts to rejuvenate the coal industry — moves that many conservation advocates view as betrayals of environmental stewardship.REI’s retraction reflects a broader trend of corporate disillusionment with the Trump administration . Companies that previously stood by the president are now facing public pressure, internal dissent, and even financial fallout. For example, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon recently reversed course on earlier praise for Trump’s trade approach, admitting that tariffs could contribute to inflation and economic slowdown.Media outlets including CNBC and The Washington Post have reported on the struggles of businesses that aligned themselves too closely with Trump’s policies, particularly in the tech sector. REI is now among the growing list of companies that appear to be reevaluating their alliances.In distancing itself from Burgum and committing to stronger advocacy on behalf of public lands, REI seems intent on realigning its image with its environmentally conscious consumer base — even if it means walking back a high-profile endorsement made just months ago.","REI has issued a formal apology for endorsing Doug Burgum, President Donald Trump’s pick for Interior Secretary.

Bondi reacts to Supreme Court pausing order on man mistakenly deported to El Salvador

Pres. Trump on man deported in error to El Salvador: 'We don't want him back'

The Supreme Court has instructed the administration of President Donald Trump to “facilitate” the return of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia , a Maryland resident mistakenly deported to El Salvador . However, it stopped short of requiring that he be brought back to the United States directly, leaving the next steps to be determined by a lower court.Abrego Garcia, who entered the United States around 2011, had previously been granted protection from deportation by an immigration judge in 2019. The judge ruled that he should not be removed to El Salvador due to threats against his life stemming from his family’s pupusa business. Despite that ruling, he was detained by immigration officers on March 12 and flown out of the country three days later.“Tonight, the rule of law prevailed. The Supreme Court upheld the District Judge’s order that the government has to bring Kilmar home,” said his attorney, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg . “Now they need to stop wasting time and get moving.”The unsigned opinion from the high court did not specify a deadline for facilitating Abrego Garcia’s return. It upheld US District Judge Paula Xinis’ order but distinguished between the terms “facilitate” and “effectuate.” While supporting the notion that the government should assist in bringing him back, the justices signaled concern that the original directive may have exceeded judicial authority.In a noteworthy remark, Justice Sonia Sotomayor pointed to existing executive policies that call for assisting with an alien’s return if their presence is necessary for continued immigration proceedings. She, along with the other liberal justices, also criticized the administration’s characterization of the wrongful deportation as a mere “oversight.”“The Government now requests an order from this Court permitting it to leave Abrego Garcia, a husband and father without a criminal record, in a Salvadoran prison for no reason recognized by the law,” the liberal justices stated. “The only argument the Government offers in support of its request, that United States courts cannot grant relief once a deportee crosses the border, is plainly wrong.”Though the court did not reject the administration’s emergency appeal outright, the three liberal justices expressed that it should have been dismissed in full.The Trump administration , in its legal filings, argued that being compelled to “effectuate” Abrego Garcia’s return would intrude upon executive authority, especially in foreign affairs. It emphasized that “facilitate” should be interpreted narrowly—merely removing any procedural or legal obstacles without mandating specific actions.Solicitor General D. John Sauer, recently confirmed to lead the administration’s appellate division, alleged that Abrego Garcia was a “ranking member” of MS-13. That claim has been used to argue that the protections granted by the 2019 court ruling no longer apply, since the administration designated MS-13 as a foreign terrorist group.However, Abrego Garcia’s legal team disputes those accusations, asserting that he has no criminal history in Maryland or anywhere else in the country. Judge Stephanie Thacker of the 4th Circuit Court noted, “The government has made no effort to demonstrate that Abrego Garcia is, in fact, a member of any gang.” She described him instead as “a gainfully employed family man who lives a law abiding and productive life.”The case now returns to the lower court, where Judge Xinis is expected to provide clarification on the scope of her directive. The Supreme Court’s opinion emphasized that the court must proceed with “due regard for the deference owed to the Executive Branch in the conduct of foreign affairs.”Legal analyst and Georgetown law professor Steve Vladeck weighed in on the ambiguity of the ruling: “Although the ruling makes clear that the district court can order the Trump administration to facilitate Abrego Garcia’s return to the United States, it is maddeningly vague about exactly how it’s supposed to do so.”“For instance, if the judge asks the government about the specific arrangements it’s made with the Salvadoran government and the government invokes the state secrets privilege, what happens then?” Vladeck added. “It is, yet again, punting in a context in which the government can take advantage of the punt – a loss for Trump on the big question, but a loss for Abrego García on what matters most.”Abrego Garcia’s deportation took place under a different authority than the controversial 1798 Alien Enemies Act, which has recently been invoked by the Trump administration and is facing multiple legal challenges. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court upheld the use of that statute but required that detainees be given notice and the opportunity for judicial review—though it left many procedural questions unanswered.Trump officials argued that negotiating with El Salvador on short notice was not feasible when the district court originally ordered Abrego Garcia’s return by a specific deadline. They also contended that decisions by the attorney general concerning deportation fall outside the jurisdiction of federal courts.Despite these arguments, the 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled unanimously in favor of Abrego Garcia. The court determined that the judiciary retained the authority to review whether his deportation violated prior legal protections and that he remained, effectively, in US custody—even while imprisoned in El Salvador.Abrego Garcia was deported on March 15 and placed in a notoriously harsh Salvadoran prison. His case continues to raise broader questions about immigration enforcement, executive power, and the extent of judicial oversight in foreign affairs.","Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident, was mistakenly deported to El Salvador.

In a freak accident that resulted in no injury, two planes grazed each other on the tarmac at Ronald Regan Washington National Airport, which recently witnessed that tragic mid-air crash that killed 67 people. At least six members of Congress from New York and New Jersey were aboard the plane.The Federal Aviation Administration confirmed it would “investigate” the 12:45 p.m. incident on the DCA taxiway, when the JFK-bound American Airlines flight carrying the lawmakers was bumped by an AA Bombardier CRJ900 bound for Charleston, SC.“American Eagle flight 5490, operated by PSA Airlines, made contact on a DCA taxiway with American Eagle flight 4522, operated by Republic Airways.

Both planes damaged their winglets and were taken out of service for inspection.At least 143 people were onboard both planes.“Serving in Congress has come with some once in a lifetime experiences … like just now while stationary on the runway at DCA, another plane just bumped into our wing,” Suffolk County Rep. Nick LaLota (R-NY) posted to X on Thursday. “Heading back to the gate, but thankfully everyone is ok!” “(And ⁦@RepGraceMeng is handing out grapes!)” he added, referring to Grace Meng (D-Queens).Four other local Democrats — Reps.

Poll Should the Pakistani military have a role in politics? No, it undermines democracy. Yes, they provide stability.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s political landscape remains a battleground of competing forces, with the military, former prime minister Imran Khan, and the current govt under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif locked in a tense struggle.The interplay of US foreign policy and the Pakistani diaspora’s growing voice adds further complexity to a nation grappling with economic woes, security threats and democratic erosion.Imran Khan, ousted in April 2022 via a no-confidence vote, continues to challenge the status quo from behind bars. Convicted on corruption and state secret charges, the cricketer-turned-politician retains a fervent base, accusing the military and Sharif’s govt of colluding with the US to orchestrate his downfall.Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) alleges widespread rigging in the Feb 2024 elections, which saw Sharif’s Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) secure power through a fragile coalition. PTI supporters, galvanised by Khan’s claims, have staged protests, clashing with the security forces and deepening the political divide.The military, longtime kingmaker in Pakistani politics, appears to have shifted allegiance. Once Khan’s backer in his 2018 rise, the army soured on him after policy disputes and his public criticisms of General Asim Munir, the current army chief.Analysts suggest the military now props up Sharif’s govt, a dynamic evident in legislative moves like the 2023 Pakistan Army Act amendment, which stifled dissent and empowered the armed forces. This hybrid regime – blending electoral democracy with military influence – has drawn scrutiny for undermining constitutional norms, yet the generals show no sign of relinquishing their grip.However, Shehbaz Sharif, re-elected in March 2024 as PM, faces a legitimacy crisis. His coalition, including the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) and other smaller factions, struggles to address surging militant attacks, crumbling infrastructure, and an economy reliant on IMF bailouts.Sharif vows to mend ties with Washington but his govt’s dependence on military support raises questions about its autonomy. Khan’s call for an election audit, echoed in a letter to the IMF, threatens to derail these efforts as Pakistan awaits a critical loan installment.The US role remains contentious. Khan’s unproven claims of a Washington-led conspiracy resonate with a populace wary of foreign interference, a sentiment rooted in decades of strained relations. The Biden administration, while engaging Sharif’s govt, has maintained robust military ties with Pakistan, prioritising counter-terrorism over democratic concerns. This ambivalence has fuelled Khan’s narrative, even as US officials dismiss his allegations.Meanwhile, the Pakistani diaspora, particularly in the US, has emerged as a vocal force. Pro-democracy activists, many aligned with PTI, have lobbied Congress, securing bipartisan support for resolutions condemning elections irregularities and Khan’s detention. Over 100 lawmakers have urged his release, while some advocate sanctions against military leaders like Munir. This diaspora-driven pressure marks a shift, challenging the traditional US-Pakistan security nexus.As Pakistan teeters between chaos and stability, the military’s shadow looms large, Khan’s defiance endures, and Sharif’s govt navigates a treacherous path. With the US and Pakistani diaspora adding external weight, the nation’s democratic future hangs in the balance.","Imran Khan, ousted in April 2022 via a no-confidence vote, continues to challenge the status quo from behind bars.

Poll Do you support the call for a long march by Sardar Akhtar Mengal? No, I do not support it. Yes, I support it.

ISLAMABAD: A tense standoff unfolded across Balochistan on Monday as a shutter-down strike and widespread road blockades sparked by nationalist leader Sardar Akhtar Mengal ’s call for a “long march” from Lakpass to Quetta paralysed the Pakistani province.The protest by Akhtar’s Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M), now in its second week, demands the release of detained Baloch activists, including women leaders of Balochistan Yakjehti Committee (BYC), amid escalating clashes with authorities.Shops businesses and schools remained closed in cities like Quetta, Kalat, Mastung Khuzdar, and Gwadar. Mengal’s supporters blocked key highways, including the Quetta-Karachi national highway.The provincial govt’s deployment of containers, trenches, and police checkpoints at Lakpass, roughly 30 km from Quetta, stalled the march, forcing demonstrators onto rugged mountain routes.Reports of police using teargas and shelling BNP-M workers have intensified the unrest.Mengal, addressing a sit-in at Lakpass, accused the state of oppression and vowed to press forward. “The state may crush us, but we won’t bow,” he declared, signalling plans to escalate the march into province-wide resistance. The protest began March 28 in Wadh, Mengal’s hometown, following the arrest of BYC leaders, including Mahrang Baloch, during a crackdown on their Quetta sit-in. A suicide bombing near the rally on March 29 left Mengal unharmed but underscored the volatile stakes.Balochistan’s govt, led by chief minister Sarfraz Bugti, has taken a hard line. His spokesperson, Shahid Rind, warned Mengal of arrest under the Maintenance of Public Order (MPO) Act if the march entered Quetta’s Red Zone.Negotiations have faltered, with Mengal dismissing the provincial govt’s delegations as powerless to meet demands. BYC, however, rallied behind Mengal, urging highway blockades and strikes to amplify pressure.Analysts see it as a critical juncture for Balochistan, where grievances over state repression, enforced disappearances and resource exploitation fuel dissent. The shutter-down has disrupted public life, with Quetta’s land links to 12 districts severed for over a week. With cellular networks down and security tightened, the province braces for what Mengal’s supporters call a defining fight.","The protest by Akhtar’s Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M), now in its second week, demands the release of detained Baloch activists.

Harvest seasons multiply

HUSSAINABAD: At the foot of Pakistan's impossibly high mountains whitened by frost all year round, farmers grappling with a lack of water have created their own ice towers.Warmer winters as a result of climate change has reduced the snow fall and subsequent seasonal snowmelt that feeds the valleys of Gilgit-Baltistan, a remote region home to K2, the world's second-highest peak.Farmers in the Skardu valley, at an altitude of up to 2,600 metres (8,200 feet) in the shadow of the Karakoram mountain range, searched online for help in how to irrigate their apple and apricot orchards.""We discovered artificial glaciers on YouTube,"" Ghulam Haider Hashmi told AFP.They watched the videos of Sonam Wangchuk , an environmental activist and engineer in the Indian region of Ladakh, less than 200 kilometres away across a heavily patrolled border, who developed the technique about 10 years ago.Water is piped from streams into the village, and sprayed into the air during the freezing winter temperatures.""The water must be propelled so that it freezes in the air when temperatures drop below zero, creating ice towers,"" said Zakir Hussain Zakir, a professor at the University of Baltistan.The ice forms in the shape of cones that resemble Buddhist stupas, and act as a storage system -- steadily melting throughout spring when temperatures rise.Gilgit-Baltistan has 13,000 glaciers -- more than any other country on Earth outside the polar regions.Their beauty has made the region one of the country's top tourist destinations -- towering peaks loom over the Old Silk Road, still visible from a highway transporting tourists between cherry orchards, glaciers and ice-blue lakes.Sher Muhammad, a specialist in the Hindu Kush-Himalayan mountain range that stretches from Afghanistan to Myanmar, however said most of the region's water supply comes from snow melt in spring, with a fraction from annual glacial melt in summers.""From late October until early April, we were receiving heavy snowfall. But in the past few years, it's quite dry,"" Muhammad, a researcher at the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), told AFP.The first ""ice stupas"" in Gilgit-Baltistan were created in 2018.Now, more than 20 villages make them every winter, and ""more than 16,000 residents have access to water without having to build reservoirs or tanks"", said Rashid-ud-Din, provincial head of GLOF-2, a UN-Pakistan plan to adapt to the effects of climate change.Farmer Muhammad Raza told AFP that eight stupas were built in his village of Hussainabad this winter, trapping approximately 20 million litres of water in the ice.""We no longer have water shortages during planting,"" he said, since the open-air reservoirs appeared on the slopes of the valley.""Before, we had to wait for the glaciers to melt in June to get water, but the stupas saved our fields,"" said Ali Kazim, also a farmer in the valley.Before the stupas, ""we planted our crops in May"", said 26-year-old Bashir Ahmed who grows potatoes, wheat and barley in nearby Pari village which has also adopted the method.And ""we only had one growing season, whereas now we can plant two or three times"" a year.Temperatures in Pakistan rose twice as fast between 1981 and 2005 compared to the global average, putting the country on the front line of climate change impacts, including water scarcity.Its 240 million inhabitants live in a territory that is 80 percent arid or semi-arid and depends on rivers and streams originating in neighbouring countries for more than three-quarters of its water.Glaciers are melting rapidly in Pakistan and across the world, with a few exceptions including the Karakoram mountain range, increasing the risk of flooding and reducing water supply over the long term.""Faced with climate change, there are neither rich nor poor, neither urban nor rural; the whole world has become vulnerable,"" said 24-year-old Yasir Parvi.""In our village, with the ice stupas, we decided to take a chance.""","Warmer winters as a result of climate change has reduced the snow fall and subsequent seasonal snowmelt that feeds the valleys of Gilgit-Baltistan. More than 20 villages make the ice stupas every winter, which provides 16,000 residents access to water.

Who are the militant groups?



Poll Do you believe the rise in militant attacks in Pakistan is primarily due to the influence of groups based in Afghanistan? No, not at all Yes, definitely

Which are the most affected regions?



What are the consequences of the rising violence?



More than 100 deadly attacks in Pakistan by Islamist militants and separatist rebels made March the deadliest month over a decade with 335 people killed, a think tank reported Thursday.Of the deaths, 228 were caused by militant groups, according to a report by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) think tank. They included 73 members of security services, including soldiers and police officers, 67 civilians and 88 militants.The Islamist-militant Pakistani Taliban, or Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), and the separatist rebel Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) were the main militant groups responsible for the attacks.The BLA was responsible for a 28-hour hijacking of the train Jaffar Express in the southwestern region Balochistan. Some 450 people were held hostage and more than two dozen were killed.Balochistan was the most affected province, followed by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in the northwest of Pakistan.They have both also been targets of suicide bombings, a form of attacks that surged in March.In Punjab, the eastern province bordering India, the think tank observed a strong increase in militant activity.At least seven attacks were recorded, and most were attributed to the TTP.In response to the growing threat, Pakistan's security forces have intensified their operations in the region. Many people have been arrested with connections to militant groups, including the TTP.Islamabad claims that most attacks, both by militants and rebels, are planned and executed from Afghanistan. It accuses the neighboring country of granting Pakistani militants space to plan and organize attacks.A recent report by the United Nations supported this claim.

'Police have swiftly moved to take action,' says Yunus

At least 72 people were arrested across Bangladesh on Wednesday for their involvement in vandalism and looting during large-scale anti-Israel protests held earlier this week, reports Dhaka Tribune.Demonstrations erupted in multiple cities, including the capital Dhaka, on Monday as thousands took to the streets to condemn Israel’s continued military actions in Gaza. Protesters from various political, social, religious, cultural, and professional organisations joined forces in what organisers described as part of a global movement supporting Palestinians.However, the protests turned violent when, in cities like Bogra, Sylhet, Cox’s Bazar and others, mobs vandalised shops and businesses, with some targeting outlets perceived to have ties to Israel. Businesses such as Bata, KFC and Pizza Hut came under attack as demonstrators called for a boycott of Israeli-affiliated products.The rallies saw widespread student participation, with many skipping classes and exams to march in solidarity. Protesters waved Palestinian flags, held up placards, and set ablaze an effigy of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Chants denouncing American backing for Israel and frustration over the inaction of international bodies like the United Nations, Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), and Arab League echoed through the streets.However, while many gatherings remained peaceful, some turned violent, leading to incidents of property damage and theft.Bangladesh's interim chief advisor Muhammad Yunus addressed the unrest in a statement posted on X. “Bangladesh police have swiftly moved to take action over the violent and unlawful events that unfolded during the Pro-Gaza protests in several cities on Monday,” he wrote. “These attacks and acts of vandalism are an affront to public safety and the rule of law.”He further confirmed that at least 60 individuals had initially been arrested.In an earlier X post on Monday, Yunus strongly condemned Israel’s actions in Gaza: “The Government of Bangladesh expresses its strongest condemnation of the Israeli Occupying Forces’ continued mass killing and gross violations of human rights in the Gaza Strip.”He referred to the situation as a “human catastrophe,” noting that Israel’s breach of ceasefire agreements had led to the deaths of scores of Palestinians—many of them women and children—while also blocking humanitarian aid.According to Gaza’s health ministry, since October 7, 2023, over 50,000 people have been killed and at least 115,000 injured as a result of the ongoing conflict. Ceasefire efforts have repeatedly failed, with both sides accusing each other of violations despite mounting international pressure.","At least 72 people were arrested across Bangladesh on Wednesday for their involvement in vandalism and looting during large-scale anti-Israel protests.

Optimism laced with caution appears to be the prevailing sentiment across Bangladeshi news media following the landmark meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the chief adviser of the interim government of Bangladesh , Muhammad Yunus. This comes at a time when there is no-real consensus about what exactly transpired in the meeting. The account provided by Yunus’s press secretary, Shafiqul Alam—particularly regarding Sheikh Hasina—has been contested by Indian sources.Significantly, this was the first summit-level meeting between the two nations since the coup of August 5, 2024, which ousted Sheikh Hasina ’s government. Tensions had escalated in recent months between the neighbours who are bounded by deep historical ties. Most prominent news outlets in Bangladesh described the meeting, held on the sidelines of Bimstec in Bangkok, as a much-needed ice-breaker.went a step further, declaring it a diplomatic victory for Bangladesh. The paper emphasized that for eight months India had avoided high-level interactions with Dhaka and insisted that any talks must exclude discussions on Hasina. Therefore, the fact that a 40-minute meeting occurred in a third country was, in their view, a breakthrough. Another daily,said that getting this meeting done only adds to the aura of Nobel winning economist Muhammad Yunus.The 'sources' in India particularly took exception to remarks made by Yunus' press secretary Alam in a Facebook post, describing the claims made about the Bangkok meeting as 'mischievous' and 'politically motivated'. Alam alleged that Yunus requested Hasina’s extradition and that Modi’s response was 'not negative'. He even claimed Modi said, 'Regardless of what was actually said, the idea that Yunus directly brought up Hasina’s extradition dominated headlines on Saturday and became a recurring theme in Sunday’s editorials. It earned Yunus praise across media outlets of various ideological stripes. However, a caveat was frequently added: Hasina remains a potential stumbling block in the normalization of Indo-Bangla relations.featured a detailed front-page story quoting various foreign policy voices. The article began with the assertion that no real improvement in ties was possible without Hasina’s extradition. Former Dhaka University professor Shahiduzzaman warned of a long-drawn process, predicting that India would not hand over Hasina, while Bangladesh would refuse to honor what he called 'biased treaties' signed by her. He advocated exploring new trade relationships, including with Pakistan.In contrast, former envoy Mashfee Shams struck a more measured tone, expressing hope that relations could move beyond the Hasina factor. M Jashim Uddin, Director of the Centre for Peace Studies at North South University, described the meeting as a diplomatic win, arguing that India was forced to acknowledge Yunus's legitimacy.asserted that India was waiting for the next election to take a definitive stance regarding Bangladesh and that was hampering the normal flow of relationship. Dubbing the meeting as a diplomatic win, it hoped that India treats Bangladesh as an equal and claimed Yunus had clearly conveyed this expectation., the most famous newspaper of the country in its editorial rued the fact that there was no real discussion about pending water agreement and said that constant engagement is the need of the hour and one or two meetings wouldn't break the deadlock. It urged India to prevent ousted PM Hasina , currently living in New Delhi from giving controversial remarks. Fairness, equality and brotherhood need to be the cornerstone of the relationship between two countries, the editorial underlined.On the issue of India’s demand for an 'inclusive election'—a veiled suggestion that Awami League should be part of the process—questioned India’s earlier silence when Hasina allegedly bulldozed the opposition to secure repeated victories. A front-page analysis on Sunday lamented that the visa issue—especially India’s drastic reduction in issuance to Bangladeshis—was overlooked. The article also noted that China had indirectly featured in the talks, with Modi reportedly indicating that he would not welcome a “third wheel” in the relationship.suggested that Yunus’s recent China visit may have paved the way for this summit. During that trip, Yunus reportedly described India’s North East as landlocked and dependent on Bangladesh, calling Bangladesh the “only guardian of the ocean”—remarks that sent shockwaves in India. Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma called the comments 'offensive' and warned against 'longstanding agendas,' emphasizing infrastructure development in the Chicken’s Neck region. In a thinly veiled statement before his Thailand departure, PM Modi described North East India as 'integral to BIMSTEC,' widely interpreted as a message to Yunus.Bangladeshi dailybelieves that India as the bigger partner had the responsibility of creating a working relationship but it was Bangladesh which took the lead. In a laudatory tone, it claims that Mohammad Younus has raised all the contentious issues and has made it clear to India that the days of flexing arm is over. Another newspaper,also harped on the theme of equality and fairness for lasting friendship between two countries.One tangible way to bolster friendship, according to Farid Hossain—former Minister (Press) at the Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi—would be for India to resume regular visa services. Speaking to, Hossain said that the Modi-Yunus meeting had generated a positive media buzz and was welcomed by many politicians in Bangladesh. However, he noted that Hasina’s extradition was unlikely in the near term and not something the general public expected soon. Instead, progress on trade normalization and the Teesta water issue would help marginalize hardliners. Farid also played down the possibility of Bangladesh not obeying existing treaties.He concluded by saying that while social media may always lean toward extreme views, calm diplomacy and mutual respect were necessary to restore normalcy in bilateral ties. And in his view, the Modi-Yunus meeting—with its honest exchanges—was just the beginning.","First summit-level meeting between the two nations since the coup of August 5, 2024, which ousted Sheikh Hasina ’s government. Tensions had escalated in recent months between the neighbours who are bounded by deep historical ties. The account provided by Yunus’s press secretary, Shafiqul Alam—particularly regarding Hasina—has been contested by Indian sources.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120093903,imgsize-883751,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

Israel’s ongoing military attacks since last month's unilateral breach of the ceasefire have killed scores of Palestinians, mostly women and children as well as blocked the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza leading to a human catastrophe. Evidently, Israel has shown no regard to repeated international appeals and has instead engaged in an increasingly intense killing spree.""Workers and professionals went on strike with organisers asking people to stop buying Israeli products.""We support humanity first of all. The things that Israel has been doing to Palestine to remove their identity from the world are brutally bad. As a human, if I don't support Palestine right now, my humanity will be lost,"" stated a Dhaka University student participant.Protesters voiced strong opposition to American support for Israel's Gaza offensive, whilst criticising the inaction of bodies like the UN, OIC and Arab League.Responding about American involvement, she said, ""They have been doing this for power, nothing else.

We are demanding to stop the genocide and to stop the killing of people.""Palestinian flags, solidarity placards, and setting fire to Netanyahu's effigy were all part of the Bangladeshi protest.The USA faces criticism over Trump's suggested forced Palestinian relocation for Gaza's reconstruction.

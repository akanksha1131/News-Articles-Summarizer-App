Fatal Crash in Ybor: November 8, 2025

Fatal US Crash: Sober Indian-Origin Driver Charged With Homicide, Linked To Border Policy Debate





Four people were killed and eleven others injured when a speeding car fleeing police ploughed into a crowd outside a popular bar in Tampa’s historic Ybor City early on Saturday.The incident occurred near Bradley’s on 7th, a well-known nightlife venue in the area, shortly after midnight.According to the Tampa Police Department, a silver sedan driven by 22-year-old Silas Sampson was first seen street racing on Hillsborough Avenue before being spotted by an air patrol unit around 12:40 am (local time).As per AP, the Florida Highway Patrol tried to intercept the vehicle using a PIT manoeuvre — a tactic that forces a car to spin out — but the attempt failed.Officers later disengaged as the vehicle sped towards downtown Tampa.Moments later, Sampson lost control of his car and crashed into a group of 15 people gathered outside the bar.Three victims died at the scene, while a fourth succumbed to injuries at a nearby hospital.Police said two of the injured were in critical condition, seven were stable and two were treated and released.Another two declined treatment for minor injuries.“This morning’s incident was a senseless tragedy,” Tampa Police Chief Lee Bercaw said in a statement cited by both outlets.“Reckless driving put innocent lives in danger. The Tampa Police Department and the Florida Highway Patrol are committed to seeking justice for the victims and their families”, Bercaw added, as per NBC News.The suspect, Sampson, was arrested and booked into the Hillsborough County Jail, according to AP.Court records show he faces four counts of vehicular homicide and four counts of aggravated fleeing or eluding with serious bodily injury or death, all first-degree felonies.In a statement quoted by NBC News, Bradley’s on 7th owner Bradley Nelson said the car struck three people on the sidewalk before crashing into the bar’s patio. “This event has been very traumatic for my entire staff and myself. Our thoughts and prayers go to the families of those who were killed, and to all the injured,” Nelson said.Tampa Mayor Jane Castor, a former police chief, said on social media, “Our entire city feels this loss,” adding that the investigation remains ongoing.The crash has reignited debate over police pursuit policies in the United States. While some agencies have restricted high-speed chases due to rising fatalities, Florida’s highway patrol has recently eased such limits, allowing for more frequent use of high-risk PIT manoeuvres.","A speeding car fleeing police ploughed into a crowd outside a popular bar in Tampa’s historic Ybor City early on Saturday.

Aundrea Griffin says love matters more than age as couple faces online criticism







Aundrea Griffin, a 39-year-old influencer from College Station, Texas, is standing strong beside her husband, Ken Griffin, 65, after facing heavy online criticism for their 26-year age gap. The couple met in 2009 at a bar in San Antonio when Aundrea was just 22 and Ken was 48. Despite the big age gap, Aundrea said she was instantly drawn to his calm and kind nature. Speaking to Daily Mail, she shared that Ken made her feel safe, respected, and loved from the very beginning.Aundrea said she found his life experience inspiring, he had two master’s degrees, spoke Italian, and had served in the Air Force for almost 30 years, traveling around the world. “He made me laugh and feel protected,” she said. “That mattered more than his age.”Soon after meeting, the two began dating and quickly faced pushback from family and friends. Some people questioned how a relationship with such a large age gap would work long-term. “My mom was worried at first,” Aundrea admitted. “But once everyone saw how real and balanced our relationship was, they accepted us.”Sixteen years later, Aundrea and Ken are still happily married.They now share five children and are expecting their sixth baby. While their close friends and family fully support them, strangers online continue to judge their relationship harshly. Aundrea, who has over 22,000 Instagram followers, said she often gets “grandpa jokes” and comments calling her a “gold digger.”She admitted that being in public can be uncomfortable because of the stares and whispers. “The hardest part is dealing with how outsiders see it,” she said. “People make assumptions before they even know us.”But Aundrea Griffin said she no longer lets the hate affect her. “It used to hurt, but now I realize it’s just people projecting their own insecurities,” she told Daily Mail. She added that her husband doesn’t care about the online hate at all, “He doesn’t even use social media.”Inside their home, Aundrea said life is peaceful and filled with love and respect. “We don’t live for people on the internet,” she said. “We live for each other and our kids.”Also Read : YouTuber Candace Owens Fires Back At Ben Shapiro After He Claims She Accused Erika Kirk Of Killing Charlie Kirk Despite the criticism, Aundrea Griffin continues to share moments from their life together, showing followers that love can last, no matter the age difference.

SmugAlana’s viral post deepens anger as fans call Twitch “dishonest”





Twitch is facing huge backlash after its apology for the assault on popular streamer Emiru (Emily Schunk) at TwitchCon San Diego. The platform said it “failed to keep Emiru safe” and promised to donate to anti-sexual violence groups. But fans and creators say Twitch is lying, hiding facts, and not taking sexual assault seriously. A viral community note under Twitch’s post claimed the company “lied on several occasions” and even withheld video evidence.Many users also said Twitch let the man who assaulted Emiru walk free. The outrage grew when another streamer, SmugAlana, mocked Twitch online for unbanning a creator accused of sexual assault after only a one-week ban. Fans now accuse Twitch of hypocrisy and protecting wrongdoers. The issue has become a huge PR disaster for the company, with growing calls for CEO Dan Clancy to take real action, or step down.After Twitch’s post on November 7, streamer SmugAlana shared a meme mocking the company. She wrote, “Nobody is taking this seriously after you unbanned a chick who sexually assaulted a dude on stream after 1 week. You ban people for longer for less.”Her post went viral fast, getting thousands of likes and reposts. Many agreed with her, saying Twitch’s punishments seem unfair and confusing.A community note added to Twitch’s apology made things worse. It accused the platform of lying multiple times, not giving full details, and hiding key evidence. Some users said Twitch claimed the attacker was detained, but video proof showed he simply walked away. Others slammed CEO Dan Clancy, saying he was “out partying” while calling Emiru a “friend” online.Fans and creators are now calling for real changes, like stronger event safety, clear rules for bans, and full transparency. Many said Twitch acts fast for small mistakes, but slow and soft when serious issues happen.By November 8, the backlash had spread beyond fans to advertisers and sponsors. Critics say Twitch’s weak response to sexual assault shows “broken priorities.” For many creators, the Emiru case is no longer just one event, it’s a symbol of how Twitch fails to protect its own streamers and ignores serious problems until they go viral.Also Read: YouTuber Candace Owens Fires Back At Ben Shapiro After He Claims She Accused Erika Kirk Of Killing Charlie Kirk","Twitch is facing huge backlash after its apology for the assault on popular streamer Emiru.

An Indian-origin employee working in the Illinois department of transportation was stopped and questioned about his immigration status while working on a Park Ridge construction project on Friday, according to the Chicago Sun Times.The employee was also asked about incoming New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani, according to Governor JB Pritzker’s office, which said the incident raised concerns over racial profiling.The employee was a US citizen working on the Busse Highway resurfacing project when three masked agents reportedly approached him. They questioned him about his immigration status, whether he had travelled to New York, and if he was aware of Mamdani’s mayoral election, before leaving the site.Governor Pritzker condemned the federal action, calling it an example of authorities questioning US citizens “apparently based on the colour of their skin.”“I am appalled they would stop and question a state employee working hard on the job to help improve our state’s roads and infrastructure,” Pritzker said in a statement. “Our state employees should be able to go to work and do their jobs without masked agents targeting them for no legitimate reason.”The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) later denied that the agents were from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) or US Customs and Border Protection.The incident worried residents in Park Ridge. Students and teachers in the local school district were instructed to remain inside after reports of federal agents in the area, WGN reported. Park Ridge-Niles School District 64 Superintendent Ben Collins confirmed he was aware of reports regarding federal immigration agents near some of the district’s schools.The episode comes after months of heightened federal immigration activity under the Trump administration’s MAGA crackdown.

New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani caught the attention of the public, especially Indians, for not just winning the polls but also for an recent video of his. The clip surfaced online just before the US city mayoral elections, showing him casually munching on Rajnigandha silver pearls during a street chat.The short video, recorded by Brooklyn-based content creator Nicolas Nuvan, shows Mamdani stepping out of a black SUV and being asked if he has eaten. “I did eat today,” he replies with a smile, before pulling out a pack of Rajnigandha — a saffron-blended cardamom seed mouth freshener widely popular in India — and adding, “I’ve also started having a lot of these… it’s like a mint.”He then offers some to Nuvan, who tastes it and exclaims, “Oh wow, that’s delicious… it feels like I’m consuming perfume.” Without missing a beat, Mamdani responds, “Perfume you can eat.”The light-hearted exchange has since gone viral and widely shared amid Mamdani’s election, with Indian users flooding the comments section with memes and quips. “No way he just ate Rajnigandha — South Asians will relate,” wrote one user while another, with play on the brand's tagline, replied, “munh mai rajnigandha, kadmon Mei NYC”.

SNAP recipients will now not go without food support, as a US federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to deliver full benefit payments to states by Friday.In Rhode Island on Thursday, US District Judge John J. McConnell Jr. ordered the administration to disburse the payments through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, though it was unlikely the 42 million Americans — about one in eight — would see the money on their food debit cards so swiftly, AP news agency reported.The order followed a challenge by cities and non-profit organisations that the administration had proposed covering only 65 per cent of the maximum benefit, which might leave some recipients without any payment this month.“The defendants failed to consider the practical consequences associated with this decision to only partially fund SNAP,” McConnell said. “They knew that there would be a long delay in paying partial SNAP payments and failed to consider the harms individuals who rely on those benefits would suffer.”McConnell was one of two judges who ruled last week that the administration could not skip November’s benefits entirely because of the federal shutdown.Last week’s rulings required the govt to use an emergency reserve fund containing $4.6 billion to pay for SNAP for November but gave it leeway to tap other money to make the full payments, which cost between $8.5 billion and $9 billion each month.On Monday, the administration said it would not use additional funds, arguing that Congress must appropriate the programme’s money. The following day, President Trump appeared to threaten withholding the benefits entirely unless Congressional Democrats agreed to reopen the government. His press secretary later clarified that partial benefits would be paid for November and that future payments were at risk if the shutdown persisted.Late on Wednesday, the USDA, which administers the programme, filed in federal court in Rhode Island that further analysis had shown the maximum benefit would amount to just 65 per cent of the usual sum.After the US federal government shut down at the start of October, Congress was unable to approve additional spending, resulting in states not receiving funds to top up participants’ SNAP cards. The programme worked by issuing reloadable debit cards that people could use to buy essential grocery items at supermarkets or via Amazon for grocery delivery. Although states administered the programme themselves, they relied heavily on funding from the federal govt.",US judge orders full benefits to be paid to 42 million Americans by Friday.

HISTORIC: Zohran Mamdani Elected New York City's First Indian-American Muslim Mayor

Maya Handa: The architect behind Zohran Mamdani’s historic mayoral victory



Steering Mamdani’s campaign





When Zohran Mamdani made history by securing the mayoralty of New York City, one name was inevitably linked to his victory: Maya Handa. Appointed as Mamdani’s campaign manager in July 2025, Handa played a pivotal role in orchestrating the campaign that saw Mamdani defeat heavyweights such as former governor Andrew Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa.The 34-year-old Democrat and state assembly member from Queens became the city’s first South Asian and Muslim mayor, winning more than 50% of the vote in a contest that drew record participation. According to official figures, over two million New Yorkers cast ballots, nearly double the turnout from four years ago and the highest in more than five decades. Mamdani maintained a lead of around nine percentage points over Cuomo, who finished with just over 40%, while Sliwa trailed slightly above 7%. Voter engagement surged across Brooklyn, Queens, and Manhattan, reaching near presidential-election levels.Handa, a seasoned political strategist with deep roots in progressive organising, turned Mamdani’s underdog campaign into a citywide force that cut across class and community lines. Working largely behind the scenes, she used her sharp political instincts to refine and amplify Mamdani’s message, one centred on economic fairness, affordable living, and social justice, ensuring it reached and resonated with New Yorkers from every borough.Maya Handa’s rise as a political strategist culminated in her appointment as Zohran Mamdani’s campaign manager for his historic bid to become New York City’s first Muslim mayor. A seasoned political organiser with a deep commitment to progressive causes, Handa’s background has made her an invaluable asset in Mamdani’s pursuit of the mayoralty.Appointed to lead the campaign in July 2025, Handa replaced Elle Bisgaard-Church, who had served as Mamdani’s chief of staff and led his primary campaign. Her appointment marked a decisive shift in the campaign’s leadership structure. As Bisgaard-Church transitioned to serve as Mamdani’s chief adviser, Handa took over day-to-day campaign management, joining alongside Afua Atta-Mensah, who became political director, and Deandra Khan, director of labour and intergovernmental affairs.Handa’s résumé reads like a map of the modern progressive movement in the United States. She has worked on Senator Elizabeth Warren’s presidential campaign, Representative Mondaire Jones’ congressional run, and India Walton’s mayoral bid in Buffalo. She also managed Nida Allam’s campaign for North Carolina’s 4th congressional district and has collaborated with the influential Working Families Party, a central player in New York’s left-leaning political landscape.In addition to these national roles, Handa has worked with prominent local officials including Queens Assemblymember Claire Valdez and Brooklyn Councilmember Shahana Hanif, both noted advocates for social justice and inclusivity. Some of these roles were not formally listed on her public profile, but multiple reports, including those by The New York Times and CNN, have documented her deep involvement in community-centred politics.When Mamdani entered the mayoral race last year, few expected him to challenge, let alone defeat, political heavyweights like Cuomo and Sliwa. He had minimal name recognition, limited funding, and very little institutional party backing. Handa’s strategic arrival transformed those significant disadvantages into a disciplined, grassroots-driven strategy.Drawing on her extensive campaign experience, Handa reoriented Mamdani’s operation around ground-level outreach, emphasising neighbourhood canvassing, precise messaging, and inclusive communication. She prioritised genuine voter connection over traditional, advertising-heavy tactics, shaping a clear narrative around economic fairness, rent freezes, and affordable childcare.Her focus on authenticity rather than polish helped Mamdani build trust across the city, resonating with working-class families in Brownsville as much as with younger professionals in Manhattan.Handa also helped strengthen the campaign’s coalition. She brought in new advisers and operational leads, including Atta-Mensah, whose role focused on expanding Black voter outreach, and Mr Lerner, a seasoned Washington operative who took charge of communications after the primary. Together, they built a tightly coordinated and disciplined campaign that remained true to Mamdani’s grassroots message while expanding its reach across the city. And though Mamdani was the public face of the movement, it was Handa who quietly engineered its success.","Maya Handa, 34, was appointed as Zohran Mamdani’s campaign manager in July 2025.

Trump Takes One Last Jab at Pelosi, Calls Retirement “A Great Thing for the Country”

Nancy Pelosi's historic clashes with Trump









President Donald Trump said Nancy Pelosi's retirement will be a great thing for America as she was 'evil, corrupt and focused on bad things for our country'. Fox News reported Trump's reaction to Pelosi's retirement. ""She was rapidly losing control of her party and it was never coming back. I’m honored she impeached me twice and failed miserably twice. Nancy Pelosi is a highly overrated politician,"" Trump said as reported by Fox's Peter Doocy.The first and only female Speaker of the US House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi announced her retirement as she said she would not seek reelection. In a video, she said: ""I have truly loved serving as your voice in Congress, and I have always honored the song of St. Francis, ‘Lord make an instrument of thy peace,’ the anthem of our city. That is why I want you, my fellow San Franciscans, to be the first to know. I will not be seeking reelection to Congress. ""“With a grateful heart, I look forward to my final year of service as your proud representative. As we go forward, my message to the city I love is this: San Francisco, know your power. We have made history. We have made progress. We have always led the way, and now we must continue to do so by remaining full participants in our Democracy and fighting for the American ideals we hold dear.”There were speculations for days that Pelosi would soon announce her retirement and she was expected to leave Congress after this time, her first in decades as a rank-and-file member.Reflecting on her many roles on Capitol Hill, Pelosi said Thursday: “I say to my colleagues in the House all of the time, no matter what title they had bestowed upon me – speaker, leader, whip – there has been no greater honor for me than to stand on the House floor and say, ‘I speak for the people of San Francisco.’”In September 2019, Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump, citing his solicitation of foreign assistance and a betrayal of national security. The showdown entered public view in dramatic fashion in 2020 when, during Trump’s State of the Union address, Pelosi tore up a copy of his speech immediately after, calling it a “manifesto of mistruths.” After January 6, 2021, Pelosi condemned Trump's role in inciting the the mob, describing his subsequent visit to the Capitol as “returning to the scene of the crime. ”","President Donald Trump said Nancy Pelosi's retirement will be a great thing for America as she was 'evil, corrupt and focused on bad things for our country' The first and only female Speaker of the US House of Representatives announced her retirement as she said she would not seek reelection.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125137197,imgsize-906604,width-400,resizemode-4/donald-trump-said-it39s-great-news-for-america-that-nancy-pelosi-is-retiring.jpg"
US Airport Shutdown: US losing $15bn each week; 40 airports to be closed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/shutdown-crisis-deepens-us-losing-15bn-each-week-40-airports-to-be-closed/articleshow/125126785.cms,"Mayhem At US Airports: Americans Suffer As FAA Orders 10% Flight Cuts Amid Govt Shutdown | Watch

40 airports to face closures





Political stalemate continues









The US government shutdown has entered uncharted territory, becoming the longest in the country’s history. With no agreement between Republicans and Democrats, key services are now being disrupted and the economic impact is growing. Analysts estimate the shutdown is costing the economy about $15bn a week, as per Bloomberg.Air travel is the latest major sector to be affected. The Federal Aviation Administration says it will reduce flights across 40 busy airports from Friday because of severe staff shortages, and officials warn that delays and cancellations are likely to worsen if the shutdown continues.The congressional deadlock centres on funding for healthcare subsidies and broader government spending. Democrats insist that expiring health insurance tax credits must be renewed and cuts to Medicaid reversed before any agreement is signed. Republicans, who control both chambers but lack the Senate votes needed to pass a spending bill alone, are pushing for a short-term funding measure without concessions. Trump has refused to engage in negotiations until the government is reopened, and at the same time has threatened to permanently sack thousands of federal workers.Nearly 1.4 million federal employees are either on unpaid leave or working without pay. Millions of Americans are already feeling the effects: food assistance has been disrupted, national parks shuttered, government-backed loans frozen, and key economic data suspended. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that growth could fall by up to two percentage points in the final quarter of the year — and that if the shutdown extends to Thanksgiving, around $14bn will never be recovered.The most alarming consequences are now being felt in US air travel. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) says it will reduce flights by 10% across 40 major airports from Friday, citing severe staffing shortages. More than 400 shortages have been logged at FAA facilities since 1 October — four times higher than this time last year. Air traffic controllers have been working unpaid for over a month, many forced into mandatory overtime while struggling to pay bills or even transport costs to work.“We’re going to ask the airlines to work with us collaboratively to reduce their schedules,” FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford said. “We’re in new territory in terms of government shutdowns.”Major aviation unions and airlines warn that hundreds, if not thousands, of flights could be cancelled. Bedford admitted the agency “can’t ignore” the impact of exhausted and unpaid workers, adding that even if the government reopens, normal operations cannot resume immediately. Transport Secretary Sean Duffy has issued some of the starkest warnings so far, saying controllers might miss a second full paycheque next week — a scenario he said could bring “mass chaos”, including the closure of airspace in parts of the country.During the past weekend alone, at least 39 flight control facilities reported potential staffing limits, compared to a pre-shutdown weekend average of just over eight. Travel industry leaders say confidence in America’s air system is being damaged, and the shutdown is “forcing difficult operational decisions” that could ripple across the global aviation network.Despite the mounting crisis, progress in Congress is limited. Senate Majority Leader John Thune claims his “gut” suggests a breakthrough may be near, but Democrats and Republicans remain entrenched. Some moderates in both parties want a deal before Thanksgiving, though repeated Senate votes on a short-term funding plan have failed 14 times.The White House has adopted a more aggressive posture than in previous shutdowns. Trump has not only refused to guarantee retroactive pay for furloughed workers, but has openly sought to permanently fire “non-essential” employees. A federal judge blocked the attempt to lay off around 4,000 workers, but the administration is appealing. “Back pay depends on who we’re talking about,” Trump told reporters. “Some workers don’t deserve to be taken care of. ”Essential services such as border control, hospital care and mail delivery continue, but many others are paralysed. National monuments are shut, government-backed loans stalled, and the suspension of economic reports has fuelled uncertainty among markets and policymakers.During the last shutdown in 2018–19, widespread flight disruptions finally forced an end to the blockade. Analysts warn history could repeat itself — but with air travel already at a breaking point and billions in economic losses mounting, the cost of political stalemate is rising fast. Whether Congress can reach a compromise, and whether the White House will sign it, remains the central unanswered question as the shutdown grinds toward a second month.","The US government shutdown has entered uncharted territory, becoming the longest in the country’s history.

Article II: The decree was to be published in the Official Gazette and became effective on issuance.

National Day celebrations





Significance today









Oman will mark National Day with its first-ever formal two-day holiday starting in 2025, commemorating the historic 1650 expulsion of Portuguese forces that restored the nation’s ports and sovereignty. More than a public holiday, it is a celebration of national identity, cultural pride, and community, giving Omanis an extended period to reflect, rejoice, and spend time with their families.Oman’s National Day commemorates the end of Portuguese control over the country. The Portuguese arrived in Oman in 1507, shortly after Vasco da Gama’s voyage around the Cape of Good Hope to India. They fortified Muscat and established it as a strategic port to protect their Indian Ocean trade routes.Over time, the Portuguese presence faced resistance. The influential Al-Ya’ribi clan, frustrated by perceived exploitation, signed a treaty with the British East India Company granting the British rights in Omani ports. This weakened Portuguese control and paved the way for a successful rebellion. On 18 November 1650, Imam Sultan Bin Saif led forces that expelled the Portuguese from Oman and its ports, restoring the nation’s sovereignty.This historic victory is the foundation of Oman’s National Day celebrations.Traditionally, Oman’s National Day was observed on 18 November. To modernize and consolidate the holiday period, His Majesty Sultan Haitham bin Tarik issued Royal Decree No. 15/2025 on 21 January 2025, amending Royal Decree No. 88/2022. The decree established 20 and 21 November as the official National Day holiday, creating a continuous two-day celebration.The decree, published in the Official Gazette (Issue 1581) on 26 January 2025, came into immediate effect. Key points include:This change consolidates the observance into a single holiday period while preserving the historical significance of Oman’s independence.Omanis observe the holiday with vibrant patriotic and cultural events:• Students proudly sing the national anthem, Salâm as-Solṭâni, during school ceremonies.• Public festivities include lively parades, fireworks, camel races, equestrian shows, and a colourful marine festival.• Once every five years, a grand military show is added to the celebrations.• Cities and towns across Oman are beautifully decorated with flags and festive lights.The two-day holiday encourages many Omanis to visit their home villages, often resulting in noticeably heavier traffic during the period. These celebrations blend historical remembrance with strong community engagement, reflecting both pride and unity.Oman’s National Day proudly serves as a reminder of the nation’s historic struggle for independence and a joyful celebration of contemporary national identity. From the historic rebellion against the Portuguese invaders centuries ago to the modern royal decree consolidating the national holiday nationwide, the observance deeply connects Oman’s proud past and vibrant present, highlighting its remarkable journey as a proud, sovereign, and enduring nation","Oman’s National Day commemorates the end of Portuguese control over the country.

'Eight planes shot down': Donald Trump adds one more plane in his India-Pakistan ceasefire claim; gives new details,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/eight-planes-shot-down-donald-trump-adds-one-more-plane-in-his-india-pakistan-ceasefire-claim-gives-new-details/articleshow/125128014.cms,"Eight Jets, Not Seven, Shot Down: Donald Trump Adds Fresh Twist to His India-Pak Ceasefire Claims





US President Donald Trump has once again reiterated his old claim that India and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire after his intervention.Speaking at an event in Miami, Florida, on Wednesday, Trump added new details to his claims, saying that after his intervention, the next day he received a call claiming that they had made peace after he put out trade conditions.Trump claimed he had solved eight wars in the nine months he had been in office and played a key role in bringing India and Pakistan to a truce. “You know, I was in the midst of a trade deal with both of them (India and Pakistan), and then I read on the front page of a certain newspaper... I heard they were going to war,"" PTI news agency quoted Trump as saying, adding that a total of eight planes had been shot down during the military conflict.His previous claim stood at seven.“I said, this is war, and they are going at it. And they are two nuclear nations. I said, ‘I'm not going to make any trade deals with you guys unless you agree to peace,"" Trump said, adding that his statement took both India and Pakistan by shock.""The two nations said 'No way. This has nothing to do...’ I said, ‘It has everything to do. You are nuclear powers. I'm not trading with you. We're not making any deals with you if you're at war with each other'.""As per the claim made by Trump, this conversation with India and Pakistan took place on May 9. On May 10-2025, both countries announced they had come to a ceasefire understanding and would stop all fighting.""A day later, I get a call saying, 'We made peace'. They stopped. I said, 'Thank you. Let's do trade'. Isn't that great? Tariffs did that… Without tariffs, that would have never happened,"" Trump said amid applause.Trump’s tariff announcement had imposed a 25 percent levy on India in response to what he described as ""the highest tariffs on US goods"" and a 19 percent tariff on Pakistan. He later added an extra 25 percent on India, taking the total to 50 percent, as a penalty for New Delhi’s purchase of Russian oil and its participation in the BRICS bloc, which, according to Trump, fostered anti-American policies.India has repeatedly denied US involvement in the truce. During the G7 Summit in Canada earlier this year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi rejected Trump’s claim.“President Trump clearly that during this period, there was no talk at any stage on subjects like India-US trade deal or US mediation between India and Pakistan,” said Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri in a press statement.The conflict between India and Pakistan escalated after New Delhi launched a tri-service strike called ‘ Operation Sindoor ’, targeting terror camps across Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. The operation followed a terror attack in April in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pahalgam, in which 26 tourists were killed.","US President Donald Trump has once again reiterated his old claim that India and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire after his intervention.

Shocking Video: UPS Cargo Plane Explodes After Takeoff In Louisville | FAA, NTSB Probe Deadly Crash

Trail of debris





WASHINGTON: Freight carriers UPS and FedEx said they have grounded their fleets of MD-11 cargo planes, after one of them was involved in a deadly crash in Kentucky this week.A McDonnell Douglas MD-11 aircraft operated by UPS exploded into flames when it crashed shortly after departing on Tuesday from the airport in the US city of Louisville, killing at least 14 people. A three-person crew was aboard.Both carriers said they were acting on a recommendation from the plane's manufacturer to halt use of these planes. McDonnell Douglas originally made the MD-11 but was acquired by Boeing in 1997.""Out of an abundance of caution and in the interest of safety, we have made the decision to temporarily ground our MD-11 fleet,"" UPS said Friday.""The grounding is effective immediately. We made this decision proactively at the recommendation of the aircraft manufacturer,"" the courier added.It said around nine percent of UPS's fleet are MD-11s.FedEx said Saturday it, too, had grounded its 28 MD-11s out of a total fleet of around 700 aircraft as it conducts a safety review.""With safety as our top priority, we recommended to the three operators of the MD-11 Freighter that they suspend flight operations while additional engineering analysis is performed,"" Boeing said in a statement.Besides UPS and FedEx, the only other carrier using the MD-11 is Western Global Airlines.Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear said another crash victim had been located, bringing the total number to 14.""Please pray for these families, the Louisville community and everyone affected by this terrible event,"" he said on X.The plane, filled with around 38,000 gallons (144,000 liters) of fuel for the long-haul flight to Hawaii, narrowly missed a major Ford vehicle assembly plant that employs about 3,000 people.Aerial footage of the crash site showed a long trail of debris as firefighters poured water on the flames, with smoke billowing from the area.Investigators have said the accident was caused by one of the engines catching fire and detaching during takeoff.Todd Inman, a member of the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), said this week that investigators had identified the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder -- known as a plane's black boxes -- and would send them to Washington for analysis.The crash was reportedly the deadliest in UPS history. Its main hub, Worldport, is in Louisville, where it employs thousands of people.According to the NTSB, the plane was built in 1991 and was modified into a cargo aircraft. McDonnell Douglas merged with Boeing in 1997.The crash comes amid the longest government shutdown in US history, with Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warning this week of ""mass chaos"" in the skies due to a lack of air traffic control staff.Inman said the NTSB was not aware of any staff shortages at Louisville's airport at the time of the crash.",UPS and FedEx say they have grounded their fleets of MD-11 cargo planes.

Steve Bannon trolled after saying Republicans will go to prison if GOP loses 2028 elections; ‘Weird thing to admit but okay’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/steve-bannon-trolled-after-saying-republicans-will-go-to-prison-if-gop-loses-2028-elections-weird-thing-to-admit-but-okay/articleshow/125190611.cms,"



Former Trump loyalist and top MAGA activist Steve Bannon once again became a centre of mockery on social media after making a dramatic prediction about the 2028 US presidential election.Speaking at a Conservative event on Thursday, the former Donald Trump strategist warned supporters that a Democratic victory could have harsh consequences for people in the room, including himself.Bannon told attendees: “If we lose the mid-terms and we lose 2028, some in this room are going to prison – myself included. They’re not going to stop; they’re getting more and more and more radical. We have to counter that, and what do we have to counter it with? We have to counter it with more action, more intense action, more urgency.”The clip went viral on X, where netizens ridiculed both tone and message.Democratic strategist Mike Nellis said: “‘if we lose, we’re going to be held accountable for our crimes’ is not the campaign slogan Steve Bannon thinks it is.”British Muslim Journalist Mehdi Hasan reacted by joking that Bannon was “promising everyone a good time.”Several memes also circulated, with users comparing his warning to a movie villain's speech or pointing out the accidental honesty of the remark.Bannon has been making frequent references to 2028 in recent days. Earlier in the week, he insisted that Donald Trump could somehow serve a third term as president, despite clear constitutional limits. He has also suggested there is “a plan” to get around the restriction and urged the public to “get accommodated” with the idea of Trump appearing on the ballot again.For many online, however, Bannon’s latest warning became another moment of ridicule rather than alarm.","Bannon warned that a Democratic victory could have harsh consequences for people in the room, including himself.

Maxwell is much 'happier and calm' in the new prison





Congress questions ‘VIP treatment’ to Maxwell





Anger inside and outside Bryan





Ongoing row around Epstein









Sex offender and trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell has described her new life inside a Texas minimum-security prison as calmer, cleaner, and far safer than the Florida facility where she previously served her 20-year sentence for recruiting minors for late pedophile Jeffrey Epstein Emails reviewed by NBC News revealed that Maxwell has been praising the living conditions of the women’s Federal Prison Camp, Bryan. However, lawmakers are on her nose, investigating whether she is receiving special treatment or not.Maxwell was moved from a low-security Tallahassee prison to the all-women’s FPC Bryan in early August. The camp usually houses inmates with nonviolent convictions, which made her transfer highly unusual.Within days of her arrival, Maxwell emailed friends and relatives, describing her surroundings in glowing terms. “The institution is run in an orderly fashion which makes for a safer more comfortable environment for all people concerned, inmates and guards alike,” she wrote.In another detailed message, she compared the facilities of Bryan to her previous facility, saying, “The food is legions better, the place is clean, the staff responsive and polite.”She added that she had not witnessed the violence, drug use or chaos she said she saw in Tallahassee. “In other words I feel like I have dropped through Alice in Wonderlands looking glass. I am much much happier here and more importantly safe.”Her transfer and the tone of her emails were not really appreciated by Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee and the House Oversight Committee. Jamie Raskin wrote to the warden asking why Maxwell appears to have special privileges, citing a Wall Street Journal report alleging special meals delivered to her dorm room, late-night workouts and private shower use.Raskin said inmates claimed they were told not to speak about Maxwell and faced retaliation for doing so. “You have provided no such justification for why prison security requires a ‘Ghislaine Maxwell’ gag order,” he wrote.Other inmates confirmed the details reviewed by the committee. One wrote that “NO inmates is allowed to prepare her meals.”Ghislaine's brother Ian Maxwell said any leaked messages were “stolen without authorisation.”Her transfer has caused frustration among prisoners and residents. One inmate, Julie Howell, was moved out of Bryan after speaking badly to the media about Maxwell’s presence, according to her lawyer.Community organiser Raequel Rogers questioned why Maxwell was placed there at all. “We want a better prison system for all, but why is she being shown privilege?” she asked. “We don’t want a child sex trafficker here.”The Federal Bureau of Prisons policy states that sex offenders must be held in at least low-security facilities unless a special waiver is granted.Maxwell being in jail remains a highly sensitive issue for many Americans, as she is the last close witness to Jeffrey Epstein who could potentially reveal more about his operations. She could even disclose whether any MAGA-aligned figures were involved in Epstein’s parties, like Donald Trump. If that is the case, her transfer to a safer and more comfortable facility may be seen as an attempt to influence her, keep her silent or even pressure her, as some Democrats have alleged. The Epstein files still have not been released, despite former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi claiming before Trump’s second term that she would make them public.","Ghislaine Maxwell has described her new life inside a Texas minimum-security prison as calmer, cleaner, and far safer than the Florida facility where she previously served her 20-year sentence.

Former US President Joe Biden delivered one of his strongest attacks yet on MAGA chief Donald Trump during a speech in Omaha on Friday, accusing the president of damaging America’s institutions and mocking his remodel of the White House.Speaking at a Nebraska Democratic Party gala, the former president told supporters he believed Trump’s actions had gone far beyond what he had expected.“I knew Trump was going to taking a wrecking ball to the country, but I had no idea, I have to admit, I didn’t know there was going to be an actual wrecking ball,” Biden said, referring to Trump’s demolition of the East Wing to build a vast 90,000 square foot, 300$ million ballroom in White House. “It’s a perfect symbol of his presidency. Trump has taken a wrecking ball not only to the people’s house but to the Constitution, to the rule of law, to our very democracy. ”Biden also mocked Trump’s claim that the United States is living through “a golden age”. He said, “He now says we are quote ‘in a golden age.’ The only gold is the stuff he’s hanging on the mantle,” slamming the ornate additions Trump has made to the Oval Office.Speaking at times as though Trump were in the room, Biden said, “You act in a way that embarrasses us as a nation, quite frankly.” He argued that Trump has prioritised the interests of his wealthy friends, saying, “You work for us, Mr. President. We don’t work for you. You work for us, not just billionaires and millionaires. I’m angry.”Biden also spoke about his recent prostate cancer treatment and used his own experience to discuss the importance of affordable health care. “I thank God for the doctors and the nurses and the incredible breakthroughs we’re making in cancer research,” he said. “Now Trump and his Republican friends are cutting government funding for health care and making it more expensive, more expensive for virtually everyone. ”His remarks came during the country’s longest-ever government shutdown. Democrats have refused to back the Republican funding bill because it excludes an extension of the subsidies that expire at the end of the year, according to CNN.Biden celebrated Tuesday’s sweeping Democratic victories, saying, “The Democratic party is back!” Wins included Zohran Mamdani’s election as New York City mayor, and gubernatorial victories for Abigail Spanberger in Virginia and Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey. A Democrat-backed redistricting measure also passed in California.He said the results show that “the American people are sending a message … to Trump and to his crowd,” and that they have rejected Trump’s agenda.Biden closed with a message of defiance, saying, “I know this nation.

'Sleepy Don': Trump Seemingly Dozes Off At Worst Possible Time Amid Chaotic Oval Office Briefing

Also read:





Growing allegations that the Trump family is drunk with power took a new high this week following a Forbes report that US military stores are now selling Trump-branded wines.The controversy erupted after the magazine reported that Trump-labelled wines and ciders had appeared on shelves of duty free stores for military personnel in Washington DC and Centreville, Virginia ahead of the holiday season. Administration officials confirmed the sales but maintained it did not violate any laws. Trump surrogates insisted the products, like many other Trump branded goods, were part of a licensing arrangement, and the President’ had no role in the same.However, watchdog groups decried the sales as a blatant monetization of federal facilities, even if no direct legal violation could be proven. ""This is one of those things where there probably isn’t any legal issue, but there is an optics and an ethics issue,"" said Jordan Libowitz spokesperson for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), adding that if the government buys the products wholesale, it could violate the Constitution's Emoluments Clause, barring presidents from extra benefits beyond salary.The incident though fits a broader pattern of the Trump family's alleged self-enrichment, including forays into crypto ventures that critics say has derailed US-India ties. In early 2025, World Liberty Financial (WLF)—a decentralized finance platform majority-owned by the Trump family (including Donald Trump as ""Chief Crypto Advocate"" and sons Eric and Donald Jr. in leadership roles, with a reported 60% stake)—signed a high-profile Letter of Intent with Pakistan's newly formed Crypto Council (PCC). The deal, which some observers say may have emboldened the Pakistani deep state to pull off the Pahalgam terrorist attack on April 26, was led by WLF co-founder Zachary Witkoff, son of Trump's longtime ally and diplomatic troubleshooter Steve Witkoff.The partnership has fueled accusations of conflicts of interest, with critics like former US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan suggesting it may have prompted Trump’s kid-glove treatment of Pakistan and prioritizing it over India. In a September 2025 Meidastouch podcast, Sullivan stated Trump ""threw the India relationship over the side"" due to Pakistan's business overtures, undermining decades of US-India alignment on technology, economics, and countering China.There have been more dodgy developments since. Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, who had advised Pakistan’s Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on positioning the country as a crypto hub, won a full and unconditional pardon from Trump late last month after he had pled guilty in November 2023 to violating US anti-money laundering laws and served a four-month prison sentence. Trump later told CBS 60 minutes he did not know who Zhao was even though he issued him a pardon.The Trump dispensation’s lavish pursuits, including the building of a White House ball room and a ""Great Gatsby""-themed Halloween gala he threw last week at Mar-a-Lago, complete with flapper dancers, feather-adorned guests, and champagne toasts, all evocative ofF. Scott Fitzgerald's tale of excess and inequality, have drawn sharp rebukes for insensitivity, coming particularly during a government shutdown. “Nothing says ‘I feel your pain’ like champagne flutes and flapper girls while kids go hungry. Happy Halloween from Count Dracula of Empathy,” the late-night host Stephen Colbert remarked, while others invoked Marie Antoinette and Caligula.","US military stores are now selling Trump-branded wines, according to a Forbes report.

Rama Duwaji, the 28-year-old artist who will become New York’s youngest first lady when Zohran Mamdani takes office in January, has spent years expressing fierce political views through her art.Duwaji kept a low public profile during Mamdani’s campaign. However, her illustrations and posts reveal firm positions on American foreign policy and Israel’s actions in Gaza, which is not liked by conservatives and MAGA activists who consider them propaganda.In mid-October, she posted four broken heart emojis with a photo of Saleh Al-Jafarawi on her Instagram story. Jafarawi was described as a pro-Hamas activist by Israel, and he was killed in Gaza by an anti-Hamas militia on October 12. “Beloved Jafarawi,” her post read.Her online work shows repeated condemnation of US and its relationship with Israel. One 2024 illustration features towering stacks of cash labelled “Israeli war crimes”. Mamdani commented under it, writing, “New York charities send over 60 million dollars every year to fund Israeli war crimes, and that number is only growing.”He urged supporters to lobby officials to end donations.In a 2020 piece showing two women and children beneath smoke from a distant aircraft, the caption states, “Presidents come and go, but American imperialism never changes.”Another animation from May depicts starving Palestinians with the words “Not a hunger crisis” before ending on the phrase, “It is deliberate starvation.”Duwaji’s path to New York was shaped by her Syrian-American family. Her mother, Dr Bariah Dardari, trained and worked as a paediatrician in New Jersey before taking leadership roles in hospitals across the UAE. She has also joined humanitarian missions to Syria and Gaza through the Syrian American Medical Society. Duwaji grew up in Texas and New Jersey before the family relocated to Dubai in 2006, reports the New York Post.Though quiet during the campaign, she reportedly helped shape Mamdani’s image and messaging. Fashion outlets have praised her style, with friends comparing her to “our modern-day Princess Diana”.Her work has appeared in the New Yorker and BBC. She told online magazine Yung in April, “My art stays being a reflection of what’s happening around me, but right now what feels even more useful than my role as an artist, is my role as a US citizen. With so many people being pushed out and silenced by fear, all I can do is use my voice to speak out about what’s happening in the US and Palestine and Syria as much as I can.”","Rama Duwaji, 28, will become New York’s youngest first lady when Zohran Mamdani takes office in January.

Jeans controversy







Sydney Sweeney’s recent interview with GQ has once again stirred up a row around the American Eagle denim campaign that earlier sparked one of the year’s biggest culture-war arguments.The advert was built around the tagline that “Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans."" The ad drew accusations of racism and eugenics in June. Her latest remarks have now reignited that row.The interview was conducted by Katherine Stoeffel. It includes several clips of Sweeney addressing the controversy for the first time. Her answer to a direct question about the row went viral on social media, where backlash was quite evident.Stoeffel had asked her to respond to concerns that “specifically in this political climate, white people shouldn’t joke about genetic superiority,” explaining that this was the main criticism of the campaign. Sweeney replied, “I think that when I have an issue that I want to speak about, people will hear.”She also said the advert “spoke for itself,” and described the public reaction from US President Donald Trump and vice president JD Vance as “surreal.”Netizens said the interview was a moment for her to directly address racial concerns or condemn racist interpretations. Instead, her short answer made people think she was dodging the question. Others argued she had no obligation to elaborate further.The discussion once again split along political lines, with liberals attacking both the campaign and her response, and MAGA supporters praising her for not engaging with ""bad-faith"" criticism.Social media also turned its attention to journalist Katherine Stoeffel, accusing her of not asking the right questions. Some users said she was too passive and had “no backbone.” Others criticised her for being too shy and not pressing Sweeney on issues like the racial impact of the advert or Sweeney’s perceived ties to the MAGA movement.The backlash began in June when American Eagle released its “Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans” advert. The brand saw the advert a playful pun, but it quickly turned into an online argument. Many critics said the wording sounded too close to ideas about eugenics and “genetic superiority,” especially because Sweeney is often framed as the typical blonde, blue-eyed American actress. The debate went viral on social media, while others argued the outrage was unnecessary and that it was only a joke about jeans.","Sydney Sweeney’s recent interview with GQ has once again stirred up a row around the American Eagle denim campaign.

Some social media users claimed the movements resembled a Nazi salute, similar to the hand gesture billionaire CEO Elon Musk was accused of making earlier this year during the inauguration day ceremony.The internet was split, with some asking how a self-proclaimed socialist like Mamdani could make a gesture that goes against everything he stands for. Others argued that regardless of anyone’s politics, it’s still a sensitive gesture to make in front of a large crowd.Although it looked like he was just waving at the crowd, online posts focused on how the gesture could be read differently.

During US President Donald Trump’s inauguration celebrations on January 20, 2025, Musk made a gesture that critics described as a “Nazi” or “fascist” salute.That moment stirred a row at the time about public behaviour, symbolism, and political intent. With the Mamdani clip circulating now, users revived those comparisons and questioned whether similar standards were being applied in both cases.The controversy also prompted some to revisit what the Nazi salute actually is. Historically, the salute involved extending the right arm forward at a slight upward angle with the hand straight, fingers together, and palm facing down. It was mandatory in Nazi Germany and often accompanied by phrases such as “Heil Hitler!” or “Sieg Heil!”.","New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani became the centre of an internet debate after a video from his victory speech went viral.

Donald Trump Stuns Shehbaz Sharif With India-Pak Peace Remark After Gaza Ceasefire Summit In Egypt





ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday once again thanked US President Donald Trump for resolving the India-Pakistan conflict in May.New Delhi has been consistently maintaining that India and Pakistan reached an understanding on May 10 to end the conflict after four days of intense cross-border drone and missile strikes, and no third party was involved in the process.""It was President Trump's bold and decisive leadership that brought about the ceasefire between Pakistan and India, restoring peace in South Asia, averting a major war, and saving millions of people,"" Sharif said while addressing Azerbaijan's Victory Day parade in Baku.Since May 10, when Trump announced on social media that India and Pakistan had agreed to a ""full and immediate ceasefire"" after a ""long night"" of talks mediated by Washington, he has repeated his claim several times that he ""helped settle"" the tensions between the two countries.India has consistently denied any third-party intervention.Pakistan has praised Trump on multiple occasions, claiming that he brokered a ceasefire during the May conflict.India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir in retaliation for the April 22 Pahalgam attack that killed 26 civilians.In his address, Sharif also mentioned Kashmir, saying that Azerbaijan's victory in Karabakh is a beacon of hope for all nations fighting against oppression.The Prime Minister said Pakistan seeks peace, but it will not allow anyone to challenge its sovereignty or undermine territorial integrity.The parade also included contingents of the armed forces from Pakistan and Turkiye who marched alongside Azerbaijani forces.

Deadlock Deepens: Afghanistan Calls Pakistan Irresponsible As Peace Talks Break Down Once Again

(With ANI inputs)





NEW DELHI: A day after peace talks between Afghanistan and Pakistan in Turkey broke down, the Taliban on Saturday accused “elements within the Pakistani military” of pursuing “anti-Afghanistan policies for years. ”“Unfortunately, certain military elements in Pakistan appear to view a stable and strong Afghanistan as contrary to their interests,” Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said in a statement on X. “They have long exploited Afghanistan’s instability, conflicts, and displacement, and now seem intent on creating tensions through fabricated pretexts.”Mujahid also rejected claims that the rise of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) was linked to the Taliban’s return to power in Kabul. “Some groups have falsely accused the Islamic Emirate, suggesting that instability in Pakistan and the TTP’s growth began with our arrival. In reality, both date back to 2002, a result of misguided policies by certain Pakistani military elements who aligned with the US, permitted drone strikes in Waziristan, and turned against their own people,” he wrote.He pointed to a series of Pakistani military campaigns against the TTP — including Operations Al-Mizan, Rah-e-Rast, Sher Dil, Nijat, Koh-e-Safid, and Zarb-e-Azb — that, he said, displaced hundreds of thousands of civilians.“In this so-called war on terror, 80,000–90,000 soldiers and civilians were killed, by Islamabad’s own count, long before the Islamic Emirate’s rise,” Mujahid added.Calling Pakistan’s instability “an internal issue,” Mujahid remarked the Taliban has taken steps to prevent cross-border militancy since taking power. These include mediating dialogue among political and religious figures, relocating refugees from the Durand Line, banning weapons among refugee populations, and issuing fatwas against unauthorized foreign jihad.“The Islamic Emirate welcomes all efforts that allow refugees to return safely,” he stated, reaffirming that Afghanistan would not allow its territory to be used to interfere in another country’s affairs.","The Taliban accused “elements within the Pakistani military’ of pursuing “anti- Afghanistan policies for years” “They have long exploited Afghanistan’s instability, conflicts, and displacement, and now seem intent on creating tensions through fabricated pretexts,” Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125186693,imgsize-78016,width-400,resizemode-4/taliban-accuses-pakistani-military-of-fueling-instability-through-quotmanufactured-pretextsquot.jpg"

The India connection



Will it make Pak army chief Asim Munir's position stronger?



Proposed change to Article 243 Description Why it increases Munir’s power Formal recognition of Field Marshal Field Marshal to be constitutionally recognized as a rank, not just an honorary title Grants Munir secure legal status, enabling tenure extension and legal protection against dismissal or demotion Creation of 'Commander of Defence Forces' (CDF) Establishes a new central position to oversee army, navy, air force Munir may transition to/head this role, consolidating command over all forces, superseding the current setup Shift of supreme command away from president to CDF Reduces President and PM’s operational control over armed forces Centralizes authority in Munir (as CDF or Field Marshal), further reducing civilian oversight Tenure extension via new constitutional language Secures longer term (potentially unlimited) for Munir in his new post Provides Munir greater continuity and leverage in national affairs Centralization of civilian government functions Ministries like education, population welfare moved under federal control Increases central government (and de facto military) power, indirectly empowering Munir Reduction of provincial autonomy Provincial share in federal resources reduced, central government gains more control Weakens provincial challenge to federal/military authority, strengthening Munir’s policy reach

Why Pakistani critics are skeptical?







Taking ""lessons"" from tensions with India, Pakistan has moved to fortify the constitutional basis of military command, signaling a push to modernize defense structures and tighten civilian-military coherence. Its law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, on Saturday, tabled the 27th Constitutional Amendment Bill in the upper house, a move aimed at revising Article 243 to formally enshrine the appointments and parallel ranks of the Army, Air, and Naval chiefs.Citing “lessons” from recent India-Pakistan standoffs, Tarar said the nature of modern warfare had changed, requiring constitutional alignment with evolving command realities.“Recent Pakistan-India tensions have taught us many lessons. The nature and strategy of war have completely changed. Appointment procedures and some positions were previously in the Army Act but were not mentioned in the 1973 Constitution. Parallel ranks exist worldwide for Air Chief and Naval Chief,” Tarar said.The move, however, has come under scanner as many believe it could give more power to military than the civilian government in Pakistan.India, on May 7, launched Operation Sindoor against terror sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, killing over 100 terrorists and targeting key JeM and LeT camps. The move, which came in retaliation to Pahalgam terror attack, turned into a major India-Pakistan issue with the latter also launching a military operation against India.By May 10, the two nations announced a ceasefire after Pakistan approached India for truce talks.Ten days after the truce, Pakistani army general Asim Munir was promoted to the rank of field marshal, the principal military advisor to the prime minister and the president of Pakistan on all matters related to national security. Before Munir, former Pakistan President Genral Ayub Khan had self elevated himself to field marshal in 1959.The proposed changes to Article 243 in Pakistan's Constitution, are designed to significantly bolster the authority of the military, specifically, army chief and recently designated field marshal Asim Munir. Here's how:According to an article by Pakistani media outlet Dawn, legal experts in Pakistan remain divided on whether such institutional adjustments truly warrant a constitutional amendment, noting that most operational reforms can be achieved through ordinary legislation rather than altering Article 243.Constitutional experts argued that modernising command structures or creating a Chief of Defence Staff-type position does not require amending Article 243. Such reforms could be introduced through ordinary legislation or defence rules. Altering the Constitution, they warned, risks expanding military autonomy under the guise of structural integration.Another confusion surrounding Article 243 stems from the changes introduced by the 26th Amendment, which extended the army chief’s tenure from three to five years. The current chief, appointed under the old law and later elevated to the ceremonial rank of field marshal, a position not mentioned in the Constitution, has become the focal point of legal ambiguity.Dawn reported that experts remain divided on whether his term automatically extends under the new law or requires a fresh notification, raising questions about the real intent behind the proposed 27th Amendment: to resolve this technical uncertainty or to further cement the military’s influence within Pakistan’s constitutional framework.","Pakistan's law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, on Saturday, tabled the 27th Constitutional Amendment Bill in the upper house.

Prices surge, tandoors punished

Trade paralysis and a deepening food crisis

Water shortage adds to worries – dams running dry





(With inputs from agencies)





Pakistan’s twin cities are staring at a worsening flour emergency after the Punjab food department halted wheat supplies to mills in Rawalpindi and Islamabad, triggering panic across markets and raising questions over the country’s fragile food security. The sudden suspension has deepened an already tense economic climate, with transport blockades, water shortages and declining dam levels all feeding fears of another nationwide crisis.Dealers say all existing orders for flour, wheat and fine flour were cancelled from Friday night, leaving shops and tandoor owners without stock, PTI reported citing the The Express Tribune.The Rawalpindi Flour Mills Association, which held an emergency meeting to address the crisis, warned that “production will remain paralysed” unless wheat permits are restored immediately. The association described the ban as “ill-considered” and cautioned that shortages could spiral into a humanitarian emergency in the federal capital and adjoining regions.Flour inflation has shot up at record pace, prompting anger from bakers and retailers. According to the Pakistan Naanbai Association, the price of a 79-kilogram sack of red flour has doubled to PKR 11,000 since the Shehbaz Sharif–Maryam Nawaz government took office.Fine flour, used widely for bread and bakery items, has risen from PKR 6,200 to PKR 12,600.The association’s president, Shafiq Qureshi, accused authorities of “state oppression”, claiming that dozens of tandoors have been demolished and nearly a hundred sealed for selling roti at higher prices in line with rising flour rates. Many owners have been fined between PKR 25,000 and PKR 50,000. “Instead of fixing the wheat supply, they are taking out their frustration on us,” Qureshi said, warning that families are being pushed to breaking point as bread becomes increasingly unaffordable.While wheat supply chokes Punjab’s food chain, Pakistan’s transport routes are already gridlocked due to deteriorating relations with Afghanistan. Thousands of trucks carrying food items, pharmaceuticals and export consignments for Afghanistan and Central Asia have been stranded at ports and highways.Senior Vice Chairman of the Goods Transport Association Imdad Hussain Naqvi said drivers are stuck without food, water or security. “This is not just a loss for transporters; it's a loss for the entire state,” he said, as quoted by PTI. He further warned that perishable goods are rotting on highways and thousands of workers are on the brink of starvation.The current wheat crisis comes months after India regulated flows from the Chenab following the Pahalgam terror attack. The move had contributed to a sharp drop in water levels at the country’s two key dams, Mangla and Tarbela.Pakistan is among six countries with the highest levels of inefficient agricultural water use, worsening freshwater losses amid arid conditions, according to the World Bank’s first global water monitoring report, Continental Drying: A Threat to Our Common Future.The study highlights that inefficient irrigation in drying regions—particularly in Pakistan, Algeria, Cambodia, Mexico, Thailand, Tunisia, and Romania—drives massive water waste, with more than two-thirds linked to water-intensive crops.","Flour inflation has shot up at record pace, prompting anger from bakers and retailers.

CIA Whistleblower Confirms Pakistan’s F-16s Were Nuke-Capable, But US Hid The Truth From The World

‘Benazir was cut out of the loop’

A cover-up?





In a startling revelation, former CIA counterproliferation officer Richard Barlow has claimed that successive US Presidents continued to certify Pakistan as a non-nuclear state until 1989 — even though Washington’s own intelligence showed that US-supplied F-16 fighter jets had been modified to deliver nuclear weapons.Barlow, who tracked Pakistan’s clandestine nuclear program through the 1980s, said US officials were fully aware of Islamabad’s nuclear capabilities. “We knew that the F-16s were capable of delivering the Pakistani nuclear weapons as they existed at that time, without any doubt. It’s a hard engineering question, period. It had been looked at by the engineers and the physicists, not by me. There was that. Yet the government went ahead with the sale,” Barlow said in an interview with ANI.He added that the Reagan and Bush administrations kept certifying that Pakistan did not possess nuclear weapons “all the way through 1989,” even as CIA assessments contradicted those claims. “The President continued to certify that Pakistan did not possess nuclear weapons all the way through 1989. Now, I mean, I can tell you that most of us in the CIA are not comfortable with that, to say the least. But we’re not elected officials,” Barlow said.“All we can do is provide the elected officials and senior policymakers with the best available intelligence information, which is accurate, and brief them accordingly. What they do after that is not our place; we’re not in control of that.”Barlow said the US intelligence community had long concluded that Pakistan’s F-16 fleet could deliver nuclear weapons, a finding later echoed in journalist Seymour Hersh’s 1993 article in The New Yorker. “You can read all about it in Seymour Hersh’s article in The New Yorker in 1993. They saw the intelligence community saw nuclear weapons moving to air bases and being put on F-16s, et cetera. You know, so the nuclear weapons that Pakistan did not possess, according to the President of the United States, were actually being stuck on,” Barlow said.The revelations trace back to the 1987 “Brass Tacks” crisis, when Pakistani scientist Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan openly hinted at a nuclear deterrent amid heightened tensions with India. Barlow noted that the US technical experts had already verified Pakistan’s nuclear capability at that time.“To put it in a nutshell, there had been studies for years inside the intelligence community by experts, like national laboratories, etc. We knew all about the Pakistani nuclear weapons design, and we knew all about the F-16s, as you could imagine,” he said.According to Barlow, then Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto had limited control over Pakistan’s nuclear program, which was effectively managed by General Mirza Aslam Beg and President Ghulam Ishaq Khan. The US, he said, only confronted Islamabad over the issue after the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan in 1989.The US had kept the matter quiet during the Afghan war to secure Pakistan’s cooperation against the Soviet Union — a Cold War priority that overshadowed nuclear proliferation concerns.Additionally, talking about past India-Pakistan tensions, Barlow said that by 1990, tensions between India and Pakistan over the nuclear issue had reached alarming levels. The crisis was ultimately defused after then Defense Secretary Robert Gates was sent to New Delhi and Islamabad by President George HW Bush.He added that the 1990 standoff was “far more dangerous” than more recent India-Pakistan flare-ups due to poor command structures and limited communication. “There was a significantly greater chance of miscalculation in 1990 and miscommunication, among other issues. So I think that was a far more dangerous period,” he said.Barlow also discussed the Pressler Amendment, a 1985 US law requiring the President to certify annually that Pakistan did not possess a nuclear device to receive military aid.“After the 1990 nuclear crisis, my bosses at the agency refused to go along with any more certifications. Believe it or not, there were still people in the US government who wanted to certify under the Pressler Amendment,” he said. “They were having a collective heart attack because they knew it was over — the aid, et cetera.”Barlow also claimed that senior US State Department officials secretly tipped off Islamabad about an undercover American operation in the 1980s to arrest a retired Pakistani general involved in nuclear smuggling. The joint CIA–Customs sting had targeted Pakistani agent Arshad Parvez, who was attempting to purchase 25 metric tons of Maraging 350 steel — a key material for uranium enrichment — under the direction of Brigadier General Inam-ul-Haq. “He was supposed to show up in Pennsylvania... but Haq didn’t show up. And I learned that some people in the State Department had tipped off the Pakistani government to this arrest warrantBarlow said he was furious upon learning that officials within his own government had sabotaged the operation, describing his reaction as “ballistic.” The revelation, he said, pointed to how elements within Washington prioritized Pakistan’s cooperation in the Afghan war over enforcing non-proliferation laws. “These were people in my own government, the enemy within,” Barlow remarked, adding that such internal compromises weakened US efforts to curb Pakistan’s nuclear build-up during the 1980s.",Former CIA counterproliferation officer Richard Barlow has claimed that successive US Presidents continued to certify Pakistan as a non-nuclear state until 1989.

Ceasefire holds despite clashes





Background of escalating tensions









NEW DELHI: The third round of peace talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan ended on Saturday without any agreement on tackling cross-border terrorism, with both sides trading blame for the collapse of negotiations.Afghanistan’s Taliban government accused Pakistan of adopting an “irresponsible and uncooperative” stance during the two-day talks held in Istanbul under the mediation of Qatar and Turkiye.“During the discussions, the Pakistani side attempted to shift all responsibility for its security to the Afghan government, while showing no willingness to take responsibility for either Afghanistan's security or its own,” Taliban government spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said on social media.The negotiations, aimed at addressing Pakistan’s concerns over attacks by the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) from Afghan territory, failed to produce a breakthrough after Kabul refused to give a written commitment to act against the group, according to Pakistani officials.Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif said the talks had been suspended indefinitely. “There is a complete deadlock. The negotiations have entered an indefinite phase,” Asif told a private TV channel, adding that “there is no programme for the fourth round of talks.”Asif thanked Qatar and Turkiye for their mediation efforts but said even the facilitators had lost optimism. “They support our stance. Even the Afghan delegation agreed with us; however, they were not ready to sign a written agreement. They wanted verbal assurances to be accepted, which is not possible in international negotiations,” he said.He reiterated that Pakistan would only recognise a formal, written accord. “If there is any attack from Afghan soil, we will respond accordingly. As long as there is no aggression, the ceasefire will remain intact,” Asif said.The breakdown in talks marks another setback for efforts to ease tensions between the two neighbours, who have seen repeated border clashes and escalating mistrust since early October.Mediation efforts falter amid renewed border tensionsThe breakdown came as tensions flared along the border, with both sides accusing each other of overnight shelling that left four Afghan civilians dead and several others wounded. Pakistan’s Information Minister Attaullah Tarar confirmed the stalemate, saying that “the onus lies on the Afghan Taliban to fulfil its long-standing international, regional, and bilateral pledges regarding control of terrorism, in which so far they have failed. ”“Pakistan does not harbour any ill-will against the Afghan people. However, it shall never support the Afghan Taliban regime’s any measures that are detrimental to the interests of the Afghan people as well as the neighbouring countries,” Tarar wrote on X, stressing that Islamabad will “continue to safeguard its citizens and sovereignty.”The talks were the latest in a series of mediation efforts since October, when cross-border fighting between Afghan and Pakistani forces left dozens dead on both sides. A Qatar-brokered ceasefire on October 19 has largely held, though sporadic clashes have continued.Pakistan has repeatedly accused Afghanistan’s Taliban government of harbouring TTP militants responsible for attacks inside Pakistan, a claim Kabul denies. Afghan officials, in turn, accuse Islamabad of initiating the latest round of border clashes.The Afghan side, led by intelligence chief Abdul Haq Wasiq, and Pakistan’s delegation, headed by Lt. Gen. Asim Malik, had met in Istanbul to salvage the truce, but the discussions yielded no progress.Tensions between the two neighbours have escalated since early October, following explosions in Kabul and Paktika that Afghanistan blamed on Pakistan. Both sides have since exchanged artillery fire and traded accusations of harbouring militants.In recent months, Pakistan has seen a surge in militant attacks claimed by the TTP, a group designated as a terrorist organisation by the United Nations and the United States. The TTP, though separate, is closely allied with the Afghan Taliban, with many of its leaders believed to be operating from within Afghanistan since the Taliban’s takeover in 2021.With the latest round of peace talks collapsing, both nations now face renewed uncertainty over how to prevent further cross-border violence, despite international mediation and repeated calls for restraint.",Third round of peace talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan ends without any agreement on tackling cross-border terrorism.

'A shame': Barlow on Indira Gandhi not approving joint India-Israel strike on Pakistan's nuclear facility





NEW DELHI: Pakistan’s initial motive for developing nuclear weapons — to counter India — gradually evolved into an effort to create an “Islamic bomb” aimed at aiding other Muslim nations, including Iran, according to former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) officer Richard Barlow.Barlow, who served as a counter-proliferation officer during the 1980s when Islamabad was covertly advancing its nuclear programme, attributed this shift in intent to Abdul Qadeer Khan, widely regarded as the father of Pakistan’s atomic weapons project.“Pakistan’s primary motive for developing nuclear weapons was to counter India. But it was also very clear from AQ Khan and the generals’ perspective that it was not just the Pakistani bomb; it was the Islamic bomb — the Muslim bomb,” Barlow told news agency ANI.“I think AQ Khan was even quoted once as saying, ‘We’ve got the Christian bomb, the Jewish bomb, and the Hindu bomb; we need a Muslim bomb.’ It was very clear to me that Pakistan intended to provide nuclear weapons technology to other Muslim countries — which is what happened,” he added.However, the phrase “Muslim bomb” did not originate with Khan but with then Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who initiated Pakistan’s nuclear programme and placed Khan at its helm.Meanwhile, Barlow also alleged that Washington’s response to Islamabad’s secret nuclear dealings was marked by “negligence.”“Not only did they (the United States) shut down from doing anything about that in 1987 and 1988, but they did nothing for the next 20 to 24 years,” he remarked.Today, only nine countries possess nuclear weapons: Russia, the United States, China, France, the United Kingdom, India, Pakistan, Israel, and North Korea — the number of weapons in that order.While India adheres to a No First Use (NFU) policy, pledging not to use nuclear weapons unless attacked first, Pakistan imposes no such restriction on itself.US President Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed that the conflict between India and Pakistan in May, was on the verge of turning nuclear, but that his “intervention” prevented an escalation and led to a ceasefire.Barlow also claimed that a proposal by Israel to jointly bomb with India, Pakistan's Kahuta nuclear facility in the early 1980s could have ""solved a lot of problems.""The disapproval by the Indira Gandhi government was a ""shame,"" he said.""I was out of government from 1982 until 1985. And I think that may have occurred while I was out of government. I heard about it at some point. But I didn't get my teeth into it because it never happened. It's a shame that Indira Gandhi didn't approve it; it would have solved a lot of problems,"" he stated.According to reports and declassified accounts, Israel and India had planned a pre-emptive airstrike on Pakistan's Kahuta uranium enrichment plant -- the core of its nuclear programme -- to prevent Islamabad from developing and proliferating nuclear weapons, particularly to Iran, which is regarded as a ""grave adversary"" by Israel .Barlow suggested that the US administration at the time, under then-President Ronald Reagan, would have strongly opposed any such strike, particularly from Israel, as it could have disrupted America's covert war effort against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan.","Former CIA counter-proliferation officer Richard Barlow says Pakistan's initial motive for developing nuclear weapons was to counter India.

Eight Jets, Not Seven, Shot Down: Donald Trump Adds Fresh Twist to His India-Pak Ceasefire Claims





NEW DELHI: Pakistan's duplicity on terrorism was laid bare once again after a minister in prime minister Shehbaz Sharif's government paid a visit to the political wing of Hafiz Saeed ’s banned Jamaat-ud-Dawah (JuD), the outfit responsible for the 26/11 Mumbai attacks.Talal Chaudhry, minister of state for interior and a close aide of Shehbaz Sharif, visited the Faisalabad office of the Pakistan Markazi Muslim League (PMML), widely recognised as the political front of Hafiz Saeed's JuD, and held meetings with its leaders on Thursday, news agency PTI reported. The visit, described locally as an attempt to ""build political consensus,"" has sparked outrage for what appears to be official patronage of a proscribed terror-linked organisation.Hafiz Saeed, the mastermind of the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, is currently serving time in Lahore jail after multiple convictions in terror-financing cases.In a statement released after the visit, the PMML said Chaudhry and party leaders discussed ""national unity"" and ""political stability,"" underscoring the importance of ""continuity of democratic processes."" The meeting, held under the guise of promoting harmony, effectively showcased how Pakistan’s political establishment continues to normalise banned extremist outfits.This marks the first visit by a federal minister to the PMML office in recent years, further blurring the line between Pakistan's political class and its radical organisations. Earlier, Punjab assembly speaker Malik Ahmad Khan had attended a PMML rally in Kasur, where he openly praised Saeed, another indication of how terror-linked figures are courted by the ruling elite.Observers say the timing is significant. The PMML’s resurgence has coincided with renewed tensions with India, especially after the Pahalgam terror attack, with the group reportedly operating freely ""under government umbrella.""","Talal Chaudhry, minister of state for interior, visited the office of the Pakistan Markazi Muslim League (PMML) The PMML is the political wing of the banned Jamaat-ud-Dawah (JuD), responsible for the 26/11 Mumbai attacks.

The incident followed Taliban claims that Pakistan had carried out airstrikes inside Afghan territory, an accusation Islamabad has neither confirmed nor denied.Islamabad has consistently urged the Taliban to prevent militant groups from using Afghan soil to launch attacks on Pakistan, a charge the Taliban firmly reject.","Pakistan fired into Afghanistan, breaking the ceasefire, as officials are in Istanbul to resume discussions with Taliban representatives.

Ceasefire talks continue amid mistrust





Pakistan’s foreign minister Ishaq Dar has admitted that he negotiated several agreements with the Taliban administration in Kabul, but was unable to implement any of them because Islamabad had not authorised him to make final decisions. Speaking in parliament, and quoted by TOLOnews, Dar said his visit to Afghanistan had been positive but ultimately meaningless due to the Pakistani government’s restrictions on his authority.Dar told lawmakers: “The meetings were very positive; I was warmly received. I didn’t leave the work unfinished there. I know our system does not allow me to make decisions. I wanted to return and implement all that was agreed upon, but the system doesn’t allow it.”His admission highlights growing institutional disarray in Islamabad as the government struggles to manage one of Pakistan’s most volatile diplomatic relationships. It also comes at a time when Pakistan and the Taliban are holding fresh talks to prevent a return to deadly border clashes.Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif confirmed on Wednesday that a delegation had left for Istanbul to resume discussions with Taliban representatives.Asif told reporters the delegation would begin negotiations on Thursday, saying: “Let’s hope Afghanistan makes use of wisdom and peace is restored in the region.” He added that Pakistan’s demand remained unchanged — that Afghanistan “clamp down on attacks originating from its soil”.According to Dawn, the latest meetings follow days of heavy border hostilities and previously failed negotiations. A fragile ceasefire is currently in place and both sides agreed to three basic principles: continuation of the truce, a monitoring and verification mechanism, and penalties for any violations. Operational details are expected to be finalised in Istanbul.Despite this, mistrust remains deep. Islamabad accuses the Taliban of sheltering militant groups responsible for attacks inside Pakistan, while Kabul accuses Pakistan of repeated violations of Afghan sovereignty. The Taliban also refuses to recognise the Durand Line, the internationally accepted boundary between the neighbours.Border closures in October caused significant economic losses, and more than 70 people were killed in recent clashes.",Pakistan’s foreign minister Ishaq Dar has admitted that he negotiated several agreements with the Taliban administration in Kabul.

.





Pakistan’s deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar has said that a symbolic “cup of tea” in Afghanistan’s capital, Kabul, turned out to be a costly mistake for Pakistan. He reiterated that such a mistake should never be repeated.Speaking in the Senate on Wednesday, Dar criticised the previous Imran Khan-led Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government, saying that under the pretext of that “cup of tea,” Pakistan had opened its borders to Afghanistan. He described this move as a serious error in judgment.“It was a big mistake and should not be repeated,” Dar said, news agency ANI reported, quoting Afghanistan’s Tolo News.Dar’s comments referred to the 2021 visit of the then-ISI chief, Lt Gen Faiz Hameed, to Kabul shortly after the Taliban seized control of Afghanistan following the withdrawal of US and allied forces.Recalling his earlier remarks made in London last year, Dar said Pakistan was “still paying the price” for that decision.He linked the surge in terrorist attacks in Pakistan to militant groups allegedly operating from Afghan soil, including the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Fitna al-Khawarij, and the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), according to ARY News.Dar added that he had held six phone conversations with Afghanistan’s foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, to raise Pakistan’s concerns and demand that Afghan territory not be used for terrorist activities.However, Afghanistan’s ministry of foreign affairs has rejected Dar’s claim.In a post on X, ministry spokesperson Hafiz Zia Ahmad said the Pakistani minister’s statements “lacked accuracy,” clarifying that the phone conversation took place in a spirit of “mutual understanding and coordination.”""The recent statements by the Pakistani Foreign Minister, in which he claimed that the Foreign Minister of the Islamic Emirate in Afghanistan, Mullah Amir Khan Muttaqi, had contacted him six times in one day, lack accuracy and realism. In fact, the first phone contact between the two sides was aimed at mutual understanding and coordination,"" the post read.Ahmad further said Dar had initially mentioned not being fully briefed on the issue and would follow up after reviewing the matter.Despite the tensions, Dar expressed hope that upcoming talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan scheduled for November 6 in Istanbul would help strengthen cooperation on security issues.Last month, relations between the two neighbours deteriorated after Pakistan carried out airstrikes inside Afghan territory, prompting retaliatory fire from the Afghan side and intense border clashes.Following mediation by Qatar and Turkiye, both countries agreed to a ceasefire, which was later extended. The Istanbul meeting will focus on finalising steps for its continued implementation, according to the Turkish Foreign Ministry.","Pakistan’s deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar has said that a symbolic “cup of tea” in Afghanistan”s capital, Kabul, turned out to be a costly mistake for Pakistan.

Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Powers Set To Grow As Shehbaz Govt Mulls 27th Constitution Amendment





The Pakistan government announced plans to introduce the 27th Constitutional Amendment, which includes proposed changes related to the command of the armed forces. The amendment will be tabled in Parliament soon, deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar confirmed on Tuesday.“Of course, the government is bringing it and will bring it … the 27th Amendment will arrive … and is about to arrive. We will try that it be tabled in accordance with principles, laws and the Constitution,” Dar said in the Senate, as quoted by PTI.According to sources, the proposed amendment includes provisions to set up a constitutional court, streamline the process for appointing the chief election commissioner, amend Article 243 dealing with matters of the armed forces, reduce the provinces’ share in federal resources, and transfer control of the education and population welfare ministries from provinces to the federal government.Article 243 of the Constitution states that “the federal government shall have control and command of the armed forces.” The proposal to revise this article is being viewed as a move that could further strengthen the position of Army Chief General Asim Munir and expand the military’s role in national affairs.Dar rejected concerns that the amendment might be passed without proper procedure. “It is not the case that the amendment is tabled and there is voting on it in a haphazard, ad hoc manner; this will not happen,” he said.He said the amendment would first be introduced in the Senate and then referred to a bipartisan committee for discussion, adding that the government would welcome positive suggestions to improve the draft.PPP Senator Raza Rabbani said the changes would damage provincial autonomy and “undo the good work of the 18th amendment,” which devolved powers to the provinces in 2010.The government has the required two-thirds majority in the 336-member National Assembly with the support of 233 members. In the 96-member Senate, it holds 61 seats and will need at least three opposition members to pass the amendment.The secrecy around the proposed changes, particularly the plan to amend Article 243, has drawn attention to whether the new constitutional move will give the armed forces greater influence in the country’s governance.","Pakistani government announces plans to introduce the 27th Constitutional Amendment.

NEW DELHI: At least 12 people were injured in an explosion in the Pakistan Supreme Court basement that jolted the building. The blast was caused by a cylinder bursting in the court's basement cafeteria. Following the blast, lawyers and court staff were immediately evacuated, and the injured were taken to the hospital.Videos shared by eyewitnesses showed damage to the Supreme Court building.

A gas cylinder exploded in the basement cafeteria of the Supreme Court of Pakistan building in Islamabad early Tuesday morning, causing the building to tremble and injuring around a dozen people, according to law-enforcement authorities and media reports.According to Ali Nasir Rizvi, Islamabad’s inspector general of police, the isolated incident occurred in the court’s canteen while an air-conditioning unit was being repaired.He confirmed that “a gas explosion occurred in the Supreme Court canteen at 10:55am (local time).” He added that “experts have also confirmed that it was a gas explosion.”The IG further pointed out that “there had been a gas leak in the canteen for several days” and that the technicians repairing the AC sustained the most serious injuries, with one technician suffering burns on 80 per cent of his body.Following the blast, around 15 people were shifted to hospital treatment centres; of these, 12 were confirmed injured by the IG. Among them, three were admitted to the Pakistan institute of medical sciences (PIMS) and nine to the Polyclinic Hospital. He noted that “the condition of two individuals is critical.”Emergency procedures were rapidly activated: lawyers and court officials evacuated the building and moved to open areas outside, and the bomb disposal squad screened the affected zone. The building’s canteen reportedly suffered damage to furniture, and the shock-wave from the explosion was felt through the lower floors of the court complex.While investigations are ongoing, the IG called attention to the pre-existing gas leak and the maintenance work being carried out on the AC system as key factors in the incident.","A gas cylinder exploded in the basement cafeteria of the Supreme Court of Pakistan building in Islamabad early Tuesday morning.

Pakistan’s Defence Minister Khawaja Asif Threatens War Against Taliban On Eve Of Afghan Peace Talks





KABUL: The latest round of Afghanistan-Pakistan peace talks in Istanbul ended without agreement, with the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan accusing Islamabad of insincerity and attempting to shift blame onto Afghanistan.In an official clarification released by Zabihullah Mujahid on November 8, the Taliban government expressed gratitude to ""the Republic of Turkey and the State of Qatar - the two brotherly countries - for hosting and mediating the talks."" It added that Afghan representatives had attended ""in good faith and with appropriate authority"" on November 6 and 7, expecting Pakistan to approach the matter ""seriously and constructively. ""The statement said Pakistan displayed an ""irresponsible and non-cooperative attitude,"" trying to ""refer all responsibilities regarding its security to the Afghan government,"" while showing ""no willingness to assume responsibility for either Afghanistan's security or its own."" Acting on leadership instructions, the Afghan delegation had aimed for ""a fundamental solution,"" but Pakistan's actions made the talks fruitless.Criticising Islamabad's stance, the Taliban reiterated its ""principled position"" that Afghanistan will not allow its territory to be used against another country, nor permit any foreign nation to violate its sovereignty and independence. The statement emphasised that defending Afghanistan's people and territory remains ""the Islamic and national duty"" of the Emirate, vowing to ""firmly defend against any aggression with the help of Allah and the support of its people. ""While reaffirming ties with the ""Muslim people of Pakistan,"" the Taliban stated it would only cooperate ""within the limits of its responsibilities and capabilities."" The statement reflected Afghanistan's frustration at Pakistan's repeated attempts to externalise internal security issues and its reluctance to commit to regional stability.Pakistan's Defence Minister Khawaja Asif admitted that the third round of talks had ""reached an uncertain stage with no results"" and said there are ""no plans yet for a fourth round."" Afghanistan's Minister for Tribes, Borders, and Tribal Affairs, Noorullah Noori, warned Pakistofficials ""not to test the patience of Afghans"" and cautioned Asif ""not to be overly confident in his country's technology,"" adding that if conflict occurs, ""both the elders and youth of Afghanistan will rise to fight. ""Zabihullah Mujahid said in a press briefing on Saturday that the issue between the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and Pakistan is long-standing, dating back to 2002, and did not emerge after the Islamic Emirate assumed power.He added that the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan had facilitated direct talks between the TTP and Pakistan, which were largely successful, but certain elements of the Pakistani military sabotaged the process. Mujahid also stated that some factions within the Pakistani military oppose a sovereign authority firmly established in Afghanistan.The Istanbul talks, meant to reduce border tensions, exposed Pakistan's duplicity, deepening mistrust and raising the potential for confrontation. While the ceasefire remains along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, Afghanistan suspects Pakistan may again launch unprovoked attacks, including drone strikes targeting civilians.","The latest round of Afghanistan-Pakistan peace talks in Istanbul ended without agreement.

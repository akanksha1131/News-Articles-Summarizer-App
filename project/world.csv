A vast underground ocean has been lurking beneath the Atlantic for millions of years

The equatorial Atlantic was long overlooked

New data reveals about temperature and salinity

Mixing creates Atlantic equatorial water

Where does this water sits in the Atlantic system

Why this matters for ocean science

Oceanographers studying the Atlantic Ocean are revisiting an old assumption using newer data and slower, more detailed analysis. For decades, researchers believed the Atlantic lacked a true equatorial water mass, unlike the Pacific and Indian oceans. Instead, water in this zone was thought to be an extension of South Atlantic Central Water. Using temperature and salinity measurements from thousands of Argo floats, scientists have now found a clearer pattern. In the upper 2,000 metres of the Atlantic, especially near the equator, water properties show a consistent structure that does not fully match known categories. The findings suggest that a distinct body of water exists within the equatorial Atlantic thermocline, shaped by mixing rather than direct formation. This adds a new layer to how the Atlantic Ocean is understood and classified.Ocean water is not uniform. Scientists define water masses by shared physical properties, mainly temperature and salinity, which tend to follow tight relationships over large distances. These patterns often point to a common origin or shared history. Once formed, water masses slowly change as they move, mix, and interact with biology.Because they store heat and dissolved gases, their behaviour matters for climate studies. Most major water masses were identified decades ago, using ship based measurements that were limited in space and time. The arrival of Argo floats has changed this picture, offering repeated, deep profiles across entire ocean basins.In the Pacific and Indian oceans, equatorial waters have been recognised since the mid-twentieth century. The Atlantic was treated differently. Its equatorial zone was assumed to be filled mainly by South Atlantic Central Water flowing northward. Earlier datasets were too sparse to separate subtle differences. As a result, small but consistent variations in temperature and salinity were grouped together. This meant that any equatorial signal was effectively blurred into surrounding water masses.Using Argo data, researchers of a study named “Is There the Equatorial Water Mass in the Atlantic Ocean?” built detailed volumetric diagrams showing how temperature and salinity vary with depth and latitude. In the equatorial Atlantic, between about 10 degrees south and 10 degrees north, the main thermocline shows a tight relationship that stands apart from both South and North Atlantic Central Waters. This layer sits roughly between 150 and 500 metres deep. It is marked by lower thermoclinicity, meaning temperature changes more gently with depth. The pattern is consistent and repeatable, which is key for identifying a separate water mass.The newly identified Atlantic Equatorial Water does not form at the surface like central waters do. Instead, it appears to be created by mixing along density surfaces. South Atlantic Central Water dominates this mixture, with a smaller contribution from North Atlantic Central Water. The estimated ratio is about three and a half to one. This mixing happens within the equatorial current system, where eastward and westward flows overlap. These alternating jets increase lateral spreading, allowing waters to blend without much vertical movement. Over time, this process produces a stable, recognisable signature.Spatially, Atlantic Equatorial Water occupies a narrow band around the equator. It is separated from neighbouring waters by thermohaline fronts rather than sharp boundaries. To the south, the separation broadly follows the South Equatorial Current, while to the north it aligns with the North Equatorial Current. These fronts help maintain the distinct temperature salinity relationship. Although the water is a mixture, its internal consistency meets the classical definition of a water mass used in oceanography.Recognising Atlantic Equatorial Water helps complete the global picture of major ocean water masses. It also improves how scientists trace heat and salt movement through the Atlantic. The study relies only on temperature and salinity, which is a limitation. Future work using oxygen, nutrients, or isotopes may confirm or refine these findings. For now, the result shows that even well-studied oceans can still reveal quiet structural details when observed closely enough.","For decades, researchers believed the Atlantic lacked a true equatorial water mass.

Iran unrest: Is Reza Pahlavi the future? Trump calls ex-crown prince ‘nice person’ but expresses uncertainty,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/iran-unrest-is-reza-pahlavi-the-future-trump-calls-ex-crown-prince-nice-person-but-expresses-uncertainty/articleshow/126537214.cms,"Donald Trump and Reza Pahlavi (AP images)

Trump Gets Death Threat At Tehran Mass Funeral Amid Iran Unrest; ‘Won’t Miss Next Shot’





US President Donald Trump on Wednesday described Iranian opposition figure Reza Pahlavi as a “very nice” person but expressed doubts over whether the exiled former crown prince could rally enough support inside Tehran to take over. His remarks came as protests against the clerical regime continued to grip the country.Speaking in an exclusive interview with Reuters at the Oval Office, Trump said there was a possibility that Iran’s clerical government could collapse under the pressure of unrest, but he did not openly support Pahlavi as an alternative leader.Trump has repeatedly warned that the United States could intervene in support of Iranian protesters, yet signalled caution about endorsing any single opposition figure.“He seems very nice, but I don’t know how he’d play within his own country. And we really aren’t up to that point yet,” Trump said.Reza Pahlavi is the son of Iran’s last shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who was overthrown in the 1979 Islamic Revolution. The 65-year-old has lived in exile for decades and has emerged as a prominent voice amid the current wave of demonstrations against Iran’s ruling establishment.Trump added that while he would not oppose Pahlavi if Iranians accepted his leadership, it was unclear whether that support existed.“I don’t know whether or not his country would accept his leadership, and certainly if they would, that would be fine with me,” he said.The US president’s remarks came as Iran faces widespread protests that began over economic hardship and have since grown into broader calls for political change and an end to the theocratic system.Demonstrations have spread across multiple cities despite heavy security measures, internet restrictions and mass arrests. Thousands of people have reportedly been killed in a crackdown on the unrest.Trump said it was possible that the government in Tehran could fall, though he cautioned that political outcomes are unpredictable. “Whether or not it falls or not, it’s going to be an interesting period of time,” he said, adding that “any regime can fail.”Pahlavi has used the moment to urge sustained protests, arguing that continued pressure could lead to the collapse of the current leadership. In a recent video message and social media post, Pahlavi said that he is preparing to return home after remaining in exile for almost five decades“I, too, am preparing to return to the homeland so that at the time of our national revolution’s victory, I can be beside you, the great nation of Iran. I believe that day is very near,” he wrote.He has also claimed that the opposition has a plan for a post-regime transition, including what he describes as a “100-day plan” to establish a democratic government and prevent chaos. “Do not abandon the streets. My heart is with you… We will take back Iran,” he said in a message, as reported by ANI.Born in Tehran in 1960, Reza Pahlavi was named crown prince in 1967. He left Iran in 1978, shortly before the revolution, to undergo jet fighter training in the United States and later studied political science at the University of Southern California. After his father’s death in 1980, he declared himself shah in exile, later telling The Washington Post in 1989, “In a way, I’m king-elect.”Despite his lineage, Pahlavi has said he does not seek a restoration of the monarchy. He has positioned himself as an advocate for a secular, democratic system achieved through non-violent civil disobedience and a national referendum, describing his role as that of a “catalyst” for change.","US President Donald Trump described Iranian opposition figure Reza Pahlavi as a “very nice” person.

Brandon Tatum explains why he is protecting Nick Shirley after death threats





Brandon Tatum says he stepped in to protect Nick Shirley after the YouTuber said he started getting death threats. Tatum explained his reason in simple words: “Exposing fraud shouldn’t come with death threats. ” The issue began after Nick Shirley shared a long video about an alleged fraud case linked to daycare centers in Minnesota. After the video went live in late December 2025, Shirley said the reaction turned scary. He claimed people began sending threats, and he feared for his safety and his family.Shirley later revealed that he could not afford full-time security on his own. That is when Brandon Tatum, also known online as Officer Tatum, stepped in. Tatum said free speech should not put anyone’s life at risk. He also shared a donation link to help cover security costs. Nick Shirley spoke about these threats on podcasts and social media, saying the pressure has been heavy and constant.Nick Shirley spoke openly about the threats during his appearance on the Modern Wisdom podcast with host Chris Williamson, released on January 10, 2026. He said he now has security with him all day and at his home.Shirley explained,“Right now, I have somebody with me 24/7. I have somebody at the house as well. Super expensive, and as a YouTuber, I do not make enough money to afford it.”He added that Brandon Tatum helped through a nonprofit security effort, saying people could donate to support safety needs.On January 13, 2026, Brandon Tatum reposted a clip and wrote,“I stepped in to help protect Nick Shirley because exposing fraud shouldn’t come with death threats. When truth-tellers are forced to pay for 24/7 security just to stay alive, that is a problem.”This was not the first time Shirley spoke about the threats. On a podcast with Patrick Bet-David, he said people warned he could be “kirked,” a reference to the killing of Charlie Kirk, who was shot at Utah Valley University in September 2025, according to police reports.Shirley said his family was also affected.“I feel bad for my family, honestly. My little sister is getting phone calls, and we did nothing wrong.”Tatum later repeated on The Officer Tatum Show that people should be able to speak without fear, saying telling the truth should never be a death sentence.In related political news, Tim Walz announced on January 5, 2026, that he would not seek re-election, according to state reports. Shirley reacted online, claiming his reporting played a role.Also Read: YouTuber LabCoatz Claims He Cracked Coca Cola Recipe After Year Long Science Testing Surprises Fans Worldwide",Brandon Tatum says he stepped in to protect Nick Shirley after the YouTuber said he started getting death threats.

DJ Akademiks and SummyahMarie livestream clash and the messages that followed





The online fight between DJ Akademiks and streamer SummyahMarie has grown bigger after private text messages were shared online. The issue centers on serious claims made by Akademiks, who said SummyahMarie was part of what he called “escort culture. ” She strongly denied this and later sent him a cease-and-desist letter to protect her name.This controversy arose during a livestream on January 10, 2026, when SummyahMarie appeared on the DAkademiks show to confront the accusations head-on. It did not take long for the dialogue to escalate as Akademiks brought up Summyah’s traveling with rappers and reiterated his charges against her. SummyahMarie countered and declared the accusations to be untrue while a few days later, on January 13, 2026, SummyahMarie uploaded pictures of the text messages between them. The messages revealed her legal notice and Akademiks’ reply, which once again put the matter into the limelight and led to new discussions online.During the January 10 livestream, DJ Akademiks questioned why SummyahMarie was in Turks and Caicos with rapper Trippie Redd. He suggested that such trips fit a pattern he called “escort culture.” SummyahMarie firmly denied this and explained that she was invited to stream and create content, not for any personal reason.She also said many women were invited on the same trip and accused Akademiks of focusing only on her to push a false story. She denied having any romantic relationship with Trippie Redd and said the claims were hurting her career.After the stream, SummyahMarie sent Akademiks a cease-and-desist letter in PDF form. In one message, she wrote:“There is a difference. I am not an escort. That statement about me is false.”Akademiks replied by saying the situation was not serious to him and questioned why legal steps were taken. He also asked for her phone number to talk privately instead of handling it through legal messages. SummyahMarie later explained that she chose a legal route to protect her image and allow Akademiks a chance to correct the statement.According to HotNewHipHop, the tension began when Akademiks reacted to a clip where SummyahMarie and friends discussed financial expectations in relationships. Akademiks addressed the clip on his livestream, which later led to the escort claims.Akademiks publicly confirmed on his January 13, 2026 livestream that he received the cease-and-desist letter and said he felt legal action after an online argument was unnecessary.

US Navy sailor betrays America: Jinchao Wei sentenced for spying for China – inside the secret mission,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/etimes/trending/us-navy-sailor-betrays-america-jinchao-wei-sentenced-for-spying-for-china-inside-the-secret-mission/articleshow/126534032.cms,"In a significant breach of trust, ex-US Navy sailor Jinchao Wei has received a sentence exceeding 16 years behind bars. Wei engaged in espionage by selling critical military information, including intricate technical manuals and operational specifics on US Navy vessels, to a Chinese intelligence agent, pocketing over $12,000 in the process.

A former US Navy sailor, Jinchao Wei, also known as Patrick Wei, has been sentenced to 200 months in prison for selling sensitive military information to a Chinese intelligence officer.25-year-old Wei was convicted by a federal jury in August 2025 following a five-day trial and one day of deliberation. He was arrested in August 2023 as he arrived for work on the amphibious assault ship USS Essex at Naval Base San Diego.The Justice Department said Wei received over $12,000 for transmitting national defence information. The evidence presented at trial showed that he sent photographs, videos, and thousands of pages of technical and operational manuals about US Navy ships to a Chinese intelligence officer between March 2022 and August 2023. The materials included details on weapons, propulsion, steering, aircraft and deck elevators, desalination systems, and damage-control procedures. Many manuals contained export-control warnings.“Members of the United States military swear to support and defend the Constitution of the United States,” said Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche.He added: “This active-duty U.S. Navy sailor betrayed his country and compromised the national security of the United States.The Justice Department will not tolerate this behavior. We stand ready to investigate, defend, and protect the interests of the American people.”Wei held a US security clearance that gave him access to sensitive national defence information. Amphibious assault ships like the Essex allow the Navy to project power and maintain an expeditionary presence, making the data he shared more important.Evidence showed that Wei was recruited on February 14, 2022, by a Chinese intelligence officer who initially posed as a naval enthusiast working for the state-owned China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation. Wei suspected the true nature of the contact and even warned a Navy friend that he was “on the radar of a China intelligence organisation” and that the person’s requests were too obvious. Despite this, he continued communications using encrypted messaging apps and began sharing sensitive information.Wei used secret digital methods to hide his activities, including digital “dead drops” that disappeared within 72 hours and new computers and phones provided by his handler. He even created hand-written receipts to document payments for the stolen information. In a post-arrest interview, Wei admitted, “I’m screwed,” and later said, “That I’m sharing the unclassified document to—I mean document with, uhm, him . . . I’m not supposed to do that.”During the trial, Wei was convicted of six counts, including conspiracy to commit espionage, espionage, and unlawful export of technical defence data. He was found not guilty of one count of naturalisation fraud. FBI Special Agent Mark Dargis said, “The FBI will aggressively defend our homeland from anyone threatening our national security, including those on the inside betraying their sworn duty to the United States. ”","Jinchao Wei, 25, has been sentenced to 200 months in prison for selling sensitive military information to a Chinese intelligence officer.

Iran on Thursday closed its airspace amid threats from US President Donald Trump over its crackdown on the protests which have rocked the Islamic Republic since the last two weeks.According to Human Rights Activists news agency, more than 2500 people have been killed in the demonstrations. The death toll included over 100 security personnel and thirteen childrenAdditionally, more than 18,400 people have been detained.Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi rejected the claims of mass causalities and accused Israel of hatching a conspiracy to create a large number of causalities in the country.In an interview with the Fox News, Araghchi played down the death toll in his country and claimed that the number is in hundreds.""When terrorist elements led from outside, entered this, you know, protests and started to shoot, you know, police forces, police officers and security forces. And there were terrorist cells. They came in, they used Daesh-style terrorist operations. They got police officers, burned them alive, they beheaded them, and they started shooting at police officers and also to the people,"" Iranian foreign minister said.""So as a result, for three days, we had, in fact, fighting against terrorists, and not with the protesters. It was completely a different story,"" he added.During the interview, he also said that the Iranian government is not planning to hang the detained protestors, claiming that the situation is under government's control.""We are in full control,"" Araghchi said.""And let's, you know, hope that wisdom would prevail. And we don't go for a high level of tension, which could be disastrous for everybody,"" he added.Responding to a question from Fox News host Bret Baier on whether he had a message for President Trump, who is considering some kind of action to help the protesters on the ground, the Araghchi said ""My message is do not repeat the same mistake that you did in June,"" the Iranian Foreign Minister said.""You know, if you try a failed experience, you will get the same result,"" he added.""You know in June, you destroyed the facilities, the machines, but the technology cannot be bombed. And the determination also cannot be bombed,"" Abbas Araghchi added.Araghchi said that the ""terrorists"" are shooting people just to drag US into the conflict.""They wanted to increase the number of deaths. Why? Because President Trump has said that if there are killings, he would intervene. And they wanted to drag him into this conflict,"" the Iranian foreign minister told Fox News.""And that was exactly an Israeli plot. They started to increase the number of deaths by killing ordinary people, by killing police officers, by starting a kind of, you know, fighting inside the different cities,"" he added.Amid the ongoing chain of events, Iran further extended its airspace to commercial aircraft. A notice to pilot said the closure was estimated to last until 7:30 am local time. A previous order had closed the airspace for just over two hours.However, the government offered no explanation of the decision to shut its airspace.Meanwhile, Air India and IndiGO also issued a travel advisory warning of possible delays as they said that their flights are using an alternative routing after the closure of Iran airspace.""Due to the emerging situation in Iran, the subsequent closure of its airspace, and in view of the safety of our passengers, Air India flights overflying the region are now using an alternative routing, which may lead to delays,” it said in a post on X.“Air India regrets the inconvenience caused to passengers due to this unforeseen disruption. Safety of our passengers and crew remains top priority,” it added.Meanwhile, Air India cancelled Thursday morning’s Delhi-New York JFK (AI 101), Delhi-Newark (AI 105) and Mumbai-JFK (AI 119). The return flights were consequentially also cancelled.IndiGo’s Baku-Delhi flight early Thursday morning also returned to the Azerbaijan capital within an hour as it was to overfly Iran after crossing the Caspian Sea.Earlier on Wednesday, some US military personnel were advised to evacuate military base in Qatar as Trump warned of possible action after a deadly crackdown on protesters in Iran.The decision came as a senior official in Tehran brought up the country's retaliatory attack in June at Al Udeid Air Base outside Doha, Qatar.An official, on the condition of anonymity, told news agency Associated Press that the move was precautionary and said such measures also were being taken across the region. The official, citing the need for operational security, would not go into further detail, including whether the evacuation was optional or mandatory, whether it affected troops or civilian personnel, or how many people were advised to leave.The US Embassy in Qatar issued a notice early Thursday saying it had “advised its personnel to exercise increased caution and limit non-essential travel” to Al Udeid Air Base. “We recommend US citizens in Qatar do the same,” it added. In Kuwait, the US embassy ordered a “temporary halt” to its personnel going to multiple military bases in the small Gulf Arab country amid heightened tensions. Kuwait is home to U.S. Army Central, the service’s Mideast command.Talking to news agency Reuters, Trump said that Iranian opposition figure Reza Pahlavi ""seems very nice"" but expressed uncertainty over whether Pahlavi would be able to muster support within Iran to eventually take over.""He seems very nice, but I don't know how he'd play within his own country,"" Trump said. ""And we really ‌aren't up to that point yet.Trump's comments went further in questioning Pahlavi's ability to lead Iran after saying last week that he had no plans to meet with him.Trump added that it is possible the government in Tehran could fall due to the protests but that in truth ""any regime can fail.""""Whether or not it falls or not, it's going to be an interesting period of time,"" he said.The demonstrations began December 28 over the collapse of the Iranian rial currency, as the country’s economy is squeezed by international sanctions levied in part over its nuclear program.Trump has repeatedly warned about potential US military action over the killing of peaceful protesters, just months after American forces bombed Iranian nuclear sites during a 12-day war launched by Israel against the Islamic Republic in June.In other developments, a mass funeral was held on Wednesday for some 100 security force members killed in the demonstrations. Tens of thousands of mourners attended, holding Iranian flags and photos of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The caskets, draped in Iranian flags, stood stacked at least three high. Red and white roses and framed photographs of the dead covered them.People elsewhere remained fearful in the streets. Plainclothes security forces still milled around some neighborhoods, though anti-riot police and members of the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard's all-volunteer Basij force appeared to have been sent back to their barracks.“We are very frightened because of these sounds (of gunfire) and protests,” said a mother of two shopping for fruits and vegetables, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals. “We have heard many are killed and many are injured. Now peace has been restored, but schools are closed, and I’m scared to send my children to school again.”Ahmadreza Tavakoli, 36, told The Associated Press he witnessed one demonstration in Tehran and was shocked by the use of firearms by authorities.“People were out to express themselves and protest, but quickly it turned into a war zone,” Tavakoli said. “The people do not have guns. Only the security forces have guns.”","Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi accused Israel of hatching a conspiracy to create a large number of causalities in the country. He also said that the Iranian government is not planning to hang the detained protestors, claiming that the situation is under government's control. Air India and IndiGO also issued a travel advisory warning of possible delays.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126538045,imgsize-1056213,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"
'Bittersweet': Nasa sends 4 astronauts back to Earth in first medical evacuation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/bittersweet-nasa-sends-4-astronauts-back-to-earth-in-first-medical-evacuation-watch/articleshow/126537386.cms,".





Video footage released by Nasa on Wednesday showed four astronauts undocking from the International Space Station, marking the agency’s first-ever medical evacuation from orbit.The crew, two Americans, a Russian cosmonaut, and a Japanese astronaut, departed aboard a SpaceX capsule after one of the astronauts required doctors’ care, prompting an early return that cuts short their mission by more than a month.The returning astronauts are Americans Mike Fincke and Zena Cardman, Russian cosmonaut Oleg Platonov, and Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui. After spending five months aboard the ISS, they are scheduled to splash down in the Pacific Ocean near San Diego early Thursday morning.“Our timing of this departure is unexpected,” Nasa astronaut Zena Cardman said ahead of the return trip, “but what was not surprising to me was how well this crew came together as a family to help each other and just take care of each other.”Nasa officials have declined to identify the astronaut who required medical care last week and have not disclosed any details of the health issue.The ailing astronaut is “stable, safe, and well cared for,” outgoing International Space Station commander Mike Fincke said earlier this week through a social media post.""First and foremost, we are all OK. Everyone on board is stable, safe, and well cared for,"" Fincke said, adding that it was a ""deliberate decision to allow the right medical evaluations to happen on the ground, where the full range of diagnostic capability exists. It's the right call, even if it's a bit bittersweet.""The four-member Crew-11 mission arrived at the International Space Station in early August and had been scheduled to remain there until mid-February, when the next crew was due to take over. However, concerns over an astronaut’s health prompted NASA to bring the team back more than a month earlier than planned.James Polk, Nasa’s chief health and medical officer, said the decision was driven by a “lingering risk” and a “lingering question as to what that diagnosis is.”Officials stressed that the medical issue was not related to spacewalk preparations or other station operations and said it did not constitute an emergency. No further details were provided, citing medical privacy.Nasa said standard re-entry and splashdown procedures would be followed, with a full team of medical specialists aboard the recovery ship in the Pacific.The return marked another overnight crew recovery for SpaceX, occurring less than 11 hours after undocking from the space station. Nasa added that it was not yet clear how soon the astronauts would be transported from California to Houston, home to the Johnson Space Center and the astronauts’ base.One American and two Russian astronauts remain aboard the space station, just six weeks into an eight-month mission that began with a Soyuz launch from Kazakhstan.Nasa and SpaceX are now working to advance the launch of a new four-member crew from Florida, currently scheduled for mid-February.While computer modelling had anticipated the possibility of a medical evacuation from the ISS roughly once every three years, Nasa said this marks the first such evacuation in its 65-year history of human spaceflight.","Four astronauts have been evacuated from the International Space Station.

The Trump administration’s announcement of an indefinite pause on immigrant visa processing for 75 countries has sparked outrage among parts of the MAGA base, who are frustrated that India was not included. The suspension is effective January 21, 2026 and is aimed at “bringing an end to the abuse” of the system by those who might exploit public benefits, according to the US State Department.The GOP government has already halted immigrant visa processing for nationals from countries including Brazil, Iran, Russia, Somalia and several African nations.Despite the broader restrictions, Indian nationals remain unaffected, which the MAGA supporters were not happy with. “Why is India not on that list,” wrote one Reddit user.Another commented: “The billionaires need them for the H‑1B visas.” Other reactions included: “What country should be next? India.""“Is this really the priority for America to become great again? and India is happy right now,"" said another.These comments came as the Republican party is pushing to invite the best and brightest, high-skilled immigrants, particularly the H‑1B visa programme to fill in crucial sectors like tech and defence.These proffesions are already dominated by Indians and Chinese.H‑1B visas have long been a source of tension for the conservative right. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has called the programme as a “total scam,” claiming it allows companies to replace American workers with cheaper foreign labour, mainly pointing to Indian workers.Conservative slain activist Charlie Kirk had also criticised the programme, arguing that the United States should stop issuing “more visas for people from India,” suggesting the country is “full.” Far-right commentator Laura Loomer has called for dismantling parts of the H‑1B system altogether. Indian-origin Nikki Haley's son Nalin Haley has also been a 'America First' loudmouth calling for an end to all legal and illegal immigration.At the same time, the MAGA stance is not uniform. Trump himself has publicly acknowledged the need for H‑1B visas to fill specialised positions lacking American talent. Tech leaders like Elon Musk have defended the programme as essential for bridging skill gaps.Meanwhile, the administration has tightened immigration processes overall, revoking over 100,000 visas since 2025 and introducing a $100,000 fee for H‑1B applications, measures that unfairly affect Indian nationals.","The US State Department announced an indefinite pause on immigrant visa processing for 75 countries.

Minneapolis is still reeling from the fatal ICE shooting of 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good on January 7, 2026. As protests against the shocking incident go on and the administration tries to justify the act, another ICE video from the city is now making the rounds on the internet.In a video going viral online, ICE agents smashed the window of a car and yanked a woman out of it for allegedly obstructing an immigration enforcement operation in Minnesota.The footage captured the incident that broke out when the unidentified driver positioned her car across lanes of traffic, apparently blocking ICE vehicles from driving through during an ongoing anti-ICE protest.As agents tried to clear the streets of screaming protestors, some of them walked up to the female driver, appearing to ask her to move along. While the woman was talking to some agents on her side, others smashed her car's passenger window.“Go, go, go, go,” people yelled at the driver. However, at the same time, one Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) agent leaned into the black sedan and unlocked the driver's door as another one grabbed the woman.""I'm disabled, I'm trying to go to the doctor up there, that’s why I couldn’t move. I am an autistic disabled person, I’m trying to go to the doctor,"" the woman was heard shouting as the agents threw her to the ground.As the agents dragged her away, standing protestors blew whistles in protest and yelled at them to stop. “Where is your humanity?” asked one while another said, ""All you do is hurt.""Following the distressing protest scene and viral video, ICE official Marcos Charles issued a warning to the people who ""interfere"" with the agency's aggressive actions, in a conversation with FOX News.""We will be arresting anybody that interferes or impedes in any of these enforcement actions,"" he warned. The official also boasted about the number of people who have already been detained.

The shocking ICE murder of 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis has taken America by storm. From the administration saving face by blaming the victim to the civilians protesting against the agency, the incident exposed to many the dark reality of ICE operations and their fatal consequences.Good was a poet and mother and most of her family members who have reacted to her loss have lamented the incident and called out the Trump administration for falsely blaming her for her fate. However, one of the late victim's former family members, her ex-father-in-law, has now broken the silence on what he thinks of the ICE shooting and his former daughter-in-law's death.Timmy Macklin is the father of Good's late ex-husband, Tim Macklin Jr. who was her second husband and died in 2023. He is also the grandfather of her 6-year-old son, Emerson.Speaking on CNN's Erin Burnett OutFront on Tuesday, Macklin, a proud Republican and Trump supporter, said he believed the circumstances around Good's death were ""hard for everybody involved.""“I’m not blaming anybody,” he said. “I mean, the ICE agent, you know, at first I didn‘t see the footage where... he was actually being rammed.I mean, I‘ve seen the bumper of the car hitting his legs. And so in a flash like that, it‘s hard to say how you would react.”“Do I agree with everything that she did? Absolutely not,” he added, about Good.The deeply religious individual also described Good's wife Becca as a ""great person"" but added, ""I think there’s some bad choices... if we’re walking in the spirit of God, I don’t think she would have been there. That’s the way I look at it.""Jonathan Ross, the ICE agent who shot Good in the head on January 7, 2026, called her a ""f****** b****"" in the video footage of the incident shot on his camera. Calling out the ICE agent, Good's father-in-law said that he needs to turn to the Bible. “His statement that he made after the incident, the things he called her, I mean, that‘s definitely showing evidence that he that he don‘t know the Lord like he should,” said Macklin.On Tuesday, CBS Evening News anchor Tony Dokoupil relayed to the President that he had been in conversation with Good's biological father who is a Trump voter, despite his daughter's apparent opposition to ICE.“I’ve been speaking to her father, who is a big supporter of yours, like many Americans are, but he’s heartbroken right now,” Dokoupil said. “He’s also heartbroken because your administration so quickly has come out and said she’s a domestic terrorist.”“I would bet you that she, under normal circumstances, was a very solid, wonderful person. But her actions were pretty tough. I’ve seen it many ways and many different shapes and forms,” replied Trump.When Burnett played Trump's message to Macklin, he claimed: “I’m a Trump supporter myself.”“Renee was an amazing person, she was full of life, full of joy, a real gentle, good mother.

An Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer who shot and killed Renee Good, a Minneapolis woman whose death sparked outrage across the country, suffered from internal bleeding after the incident, a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) official confirmed with The Hill.The extent of ICE officer Jonathan Ross ’s bleeding remained unclear. Video taken of the incident showed Ross walking up and down the street after Good was shot and killed./Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said following the shooting on January 7 that Ross was hospitalised after the shooting. Noem claimed Good struck the officer with her SUV, which she later called an act of “domestic terrorism.”“The officer was hit by the vehicle,” Noem told reporters at a press conference. “She hit him. He went to the hospital. A doctor did treat him. He has been released.”Good’s death drew condemnation and expanded Minnesota’s growing tensions with the federal govt, which was previously focused on a growing welfare fraud scandal.Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey (D) said that most protests in his city, which drew thousands of protesters since Good was killed, were peaceful. They carried on through the weekend, with some protesters facing off with federal officers, who deployed tear gas while clad in helmets and carrying batons.Frey and other state and local officials told ICE to stop its operations in Minnesota. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said Monday that the state sued the Trump administration to block a federal immigration enforcement surge in the Gopher State.“This has to stop,” Ellison said. “Let’s be clear: it never should have started. These agents have no good reason to be here.”DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin called it “astounding that the Left can miraculously rediscover the Tenth Amendment when they don’t want federal law enforcement officers to enforce federal law.”President Trump, who also defended Ross since Good’s death, told CBS News’s Tony Dokoupil that her actions “were pretty tough” before she was killed.“I would bet you that she, under normal circumstances, was a very solid, wonderful person,” Trump told Dokoupil in a message to Good’s father, a supporter of the President. “But her actions were pretty tough.”","Renee Good, a Minneapolis woman whose death sparked outrage across the country, suffered from internal bleeding after the incident.

Explained: How Greenland fits into Donald Trump's $175 billion Golden Dome missile shield,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/explained-how-greenland-fits-into-donald-trumps-175-billion-golden-dome-missile-shield/articleshow/126531929.cms,"'Mind Your Own Business!': Trump RAGES As Greenland PM Picks Denmark Over US | 'NATO Ineffective...'

Is Trump’s obsession with making Greenland the 51st state of the United States linked with his “Golden Dome”, a $175 Billion, multi-layered missile defense system?

Missile paths cross Greenland

Greenland hosts key US space assets

Arctic is vital for space control

China and Russia raise the stakes





US President Donald Trump said American control of Greenland was “vital” for the Golden Dome defence system, arguing it was needed for US national security and for Nato’s effectiveness.“The United States needs Greenland for the purpose of National Security. It is vital for the Golden Dome that we are building,” Trump, who has vowed to seize the Arctic island from ally Denmark, wrote on social media.“Nato becomes far more formidable and effective with Greenland in the hands of the UNITED STATES. Anything less than that is unacceptable.”And the answer is Yes. Greenland’s importance to the Golden Dome lies in its geography, space infrastructure, missile-flight paths, and Arctic dominance, not merely politics or raw materials.Greenland, positioned between the US and Russia, was described as an area of high strategic importance for Americans and for Arctic security, and as a territory known for untapped raw materials, from oil and gas reserves to critical mineral deposits, Eurasian Times reported.Russian ballistic missiles aimed at the United States would likely fly over Greenland because the shortest route runs across the Arctic.This makes Greenland an ideal place to spot, track, and intercept missiles early. Missile defence works best when sensors and interceptors are positioned close to the missile’s flight path.Greenland is home to Pituffik Space Base, formerly known as Thule Air Base. It is now part of the US Space Force. The base supports missile-warning radars, satellite tracking, and space surveillance. The Golden Dome relies on these space-based systems, not just ground defences.Satellites in polar orbit pass over the High North many times a day. Greenland is one of the best locations on Earth to command satellites, relay data, and coordinate space-based missile defence. Experts say it is second only to Norway’s Svalbard—but it is closer to the US and easier to protect, as per Eurasian Times.Russia is militarising the Arctic, and China is expanding its influence there. Both are developing anti-satellite weapons and long-range missiles. The Golden Dome is designed to counter this combined threat from the north and from space.","Greenland is home to Pituffik Space Base, formerly known as Thule Air Base.

Shaksgam Valley: India bristles over China's fresh claim,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/shaksgam-valley-india-bristles-over-chinas-fresh-claim-dispute-explained/articleshow/126529230.cms,"What is the Shaksgam Valley?

What is the dispute about?

Why does Shaksgam Valley matter strategically?

Proximity to Siachen and Ladakh

The valley lies close to the Siachen Glacier, where Indian and Pakistani troops have been locked in a military standoff for decades. Chinese activity in the area adds a third actor to an already volatile theatre. China-Pakistan strategic depth

The region provides China and Pakistan with contiguous territorial access, enabling coordination between Xinjiang and Gilgit-Baltistan. This was impossible before the 1963 agreement. Military and logistics implications

Infrastructure in the Shaksgam Valley improves China’s ability to move troops, equipment and supplies near India’s northern frontiers, particularly Ladakh. Precedent for territorial claims

For India, accepting Chinese control over Shaksgam would weaken its legal position on PoK as a whole and dilute the 1994 parliamentary resolution asserting that the entire region belongs to India.

What has MEA said?

What China said?

What is the China-Pakistan boundary agreement of 1963?

Why does India call the 1963 agreement illegal?

Pakistan is an occupying power: New Delhi holds that Pakistan’s control over parts of Jammu and Kashmir is illegal, making any territorial transfer invalid.

Violation of India’s sovereignty: Any alteration of borders in Jammu and Kashmir without India’s consent infringes upon its territorial integrity.

Dangerous precedent: Accepting the agreement would legitimise third-party involvement in the Kashmir dispute. This legal position has remained unchanged across governments and decades.

What is CPEC and how does it link to Shaksgam Valley?

Why is China pushing infrastructure in this area now?

Securing Xinjiang’s western approache

Protecting CPEC assets amid militant threats in Pakistan

Signalling resolve after standoffs in eastern Ladakh

Reinforce claims through physical presence

Infrastructure, in this sense, becomes both a logistical asset and a political statement.

Where does Pakistan stand?

What happens next?





NEW DELHI: China’s fresh assertion that the Shaksgam Valley “belongs to China” has reopened a largely forgotten but strategically explosive fault line in the long-running Kashmir dispute. Beijing’s defence of infrastructure construction in the region -- tied closely to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) -- has drawn a sharp response from New Delhi, which has once again described the area as an “integral and inalienable part of India”.The disagreement is not merely semantic. At stake are territorial sovereignty, India’s claims over Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), China’s growing footprint in the western Himalayas, and the future shape of regional connectivity linking Xinjiang, Gilgit-Baltistan and the Arabian Sea.This explainer breaks down what the Shaksgam Valley is, why it matters, the legal roots of the dispute, what India and China have said, and how CPEC and the 1963 China-Pakistan boundary agreement fit into the larger geopolitical picture.The Shaksgam Valley -- also known as the Trans-Karakoram Tract -- is a sparsely populated, high-altitude region located north of the Siachen Glacier . It borders China’s Xinjiang province to the north, Pakistan-occupied Gilgit-Baltistan to the south and west, and the Siachen area to the east.Geographically inhospitable, the region is marked by glaciers, mountain passes and extreme weather. Politically, however, it is one of the most sensitive pieces of territory in the Kashmir puzzle.India maintains that the Shaksgam Valley is part of the former princely state of Jammu and Kashmir and therefore legally belongs to India. Pakistan , which has occupied parts of Jammu and Kashmir since 1947, transferred control of the area to China in 1963 — a move New Delhi has never recognised.China currently administers the territory as part of Xinjiang and treats it as sovereign Chinese land.At its core, the dispute revolves around who has the legal authority to decide the fate of the Shaksgam Valley.India’s position is straightforward: Pakistan had no legal right to cede any part of Jammu and Kashmir to a third country because it is an occupying power in PoK. Any agreement signed by Pakistan concerning that territory is therefore “illegal and invalid”.China and Pakistan argue otherwise. They say the 1963 China-Pakistan boundary agreement was a sovereign decision between two independent states to demarcate their frontier and bring stability to a previously undefined border.Beijing has now gone a step further by asserting that infrastructure development in the region is “fully justified”, signalling that it considers the issue closed — at least from its perspective.Despite its harsh terrain, the Shaksgam Valley holds outsized strategic importance for four key reasons:India’s response has been unusually firm and consistent. Ministry of external affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal has categorically rejected both China’s claims and Pakistan’s role in facilitating them.“Shaksgam Valley is an Indian territory. We have never recognised the so-called China-Pakistan boundary agreement of 1963,” Jaiswal said during a weekly briefing.He added that India also does not recognise the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, which passes through territory “under forcible and illegal occupation of Pakistan”.Jaiswal underlined that the entire Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh are an integral and inalienable part of India, and said New Delhi has consistently protested attempts to alter the ground reality in the Shaksgam Valley.Importantly, India has also reserved the right to take necessary measures to safeguard its interests, language that signals both diplomatic and strategic options remain open.China’s response has been equally direct.Beijing's foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning rejected India’s objections, stating: “The territory you mentioned belongs to China. It’s fully justified for China to conduct infrastructure construction on its own territory.”She said China and Pakistan had signed a boundary agreement in the 1960s and demarcated their border as an exercise of sovereign rights.On India’s criticism of CPEC, Mao repeated Beijing’s long-standing line that the project is an economic cooperation initiative aimed at development and improving livelihoods.Crucially, she added that the boundary agreement and CPEC do not affect China’s position on the Kashmir issue, which Beijing says should be resolved peacefully in accordance with UN resolutions and bilateral agreements.Signed on March 2, 1963, the China-Pakistan boundary agreement formally transferred 5,180 square kilometres of territory in the Shaksgam Valley from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir to China.At the time, Pakistan described the move as a provisional arrangement, pending the final settlement of the Kashmir dispute. The agreement includes a clause stating that once Kashmir is resolved, the sovereign authority would renegotiate the boundary with China.India rejected the agreement outright, arguing that Pakistan had no locus standi to sign away territory that legally belonged to India.For China and Pakistan, however, the agreement served a vital purpose: it created a shared land border, laying the foundation for their enduring strategic partnership.India’s objections rest on three pillars:The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor is a Beijing's flagship Belt and Road Initiative project valued at around $60 billion. It links China’s Xinjiang region to Pakistan’s Gwadar port through roads, railways, energy projects and industrial zones.Parts of CPEC pass through Gilgit-Baltistan, which is a part of PoK.While Shaksgam Valley is not the most visible segment of CPEC, its integration into Chinese logistics networks strengthens Beijing’s western connectivity and supports Pakistan’s role as China’s gateway to the Arabian Sea.India argues that CPEC directly infringes on its sovereignty, and has repeatedly warned against third-country participation in projects passing through PoK.Several factors appear to be driving Beijing’s assertiveness:Pakistan has backed China’s position, insisting that the 1963 agreement is valid and that CPEC is critical to its economic future.Islamabad recently announced the creation of a Special Protection Unit to safeguard Chinese nationals working on CPEC projects, underscoring how central the corridor has become to Pakistan-China ties.India, however, continues to describe Pakistan’s actions as illegal and accuses Islamabad of trading away territory that does not belong to it.In the short term, the dispute is likely to play out diplomatically, with India continuing to lodge protests and China proceeding with its projects.In the longer term, the Shaksgam Valley could emerge as another pressure point in the already strained India-China relationship, especially if infrastructure development alters the strategic balance near Ladakh and Siachen.For New Delhi, the challenge lies in defending its territorial claims without triggering escalation, while preventing the gradual normalisation of a situation it considers unlawful.The Shaksgam Valley may be remote and uninhabited, but it sits at the crossroads of India-China rivalry, Pakistan’s territorial gambits, and China’s westward expansion.China’s renewed claim and India’s firm rejection show that the issue is far from settled. What was once a quiet footnote to the Kashmir dispute is now re-emerging as a live geopolitical fault line — one that could shape the strategic landscape of the Himalayas for years to come.","The Shaksgam Valley is a sparsely populated, high-altitude region. It borders China’s Xinjiang province to the north, Pakistan-occupied Gilgit-Baltistan to the south and west, and the Siachen area to the east. It is one of the most sensitive pieces of territory in the Kashmir puzzle. Beijing's defence of infrastructure construction in the region has drawn a sharp response.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126529183,imgsize-1792158,width-400,resizemode-4/representative-ai-image.jpg"

Pact To Power Bloc: How Turkish Arms, Saudi Money And Pakistan Nukes May Align In Islamic NATO





Islamic Nato in the making? Turkey is seeking to join a defence alliance between nuclear-armed Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, this can be seen as an effort in direction to reshape security alignments in the Middle East region and beyond, as Bloomberg reported.The pact, initially signed by Pakistan and Saudi Arabia in September, reportedly states that “any aggression” against one member would be treated as an attack on all -- a provision that mirrors Article 5 of Nato, of which Turkey is a member and fields the second-largest military after the US.Talks on Turkey’s entry are said to be at an advanced stage, with a deal appearing likely, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg on condition of anonymity.Bloomberg reported that the expanded alliance reflects growing overlap in the strategic interests of Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan across South Asia, the Middle East and parts of Africa.Turkey also sees the arrangement as a way to strengthen its security and deterrence posture at a time when questions persist over US reliability and President Donald Trump’s commitment to Nato, despite Washington’s close military ties with all three countries.Saudi Arabia would bring financial strength to the grouping, Pakistan its nuclear capability, ballistic missiles and manpower, while Turkey contributes military experience and a rapidly expanding defence industry, said Nihat Ali Ozcan, a strategist with Ankara-based think tank TEPAV.“As the US prioritizes its own interests and that of Israel in the region, changing dynamics and fallout from regional conflicts are prompting countries to develop new mechanisms to identify friends and foes,” Ozcan said.Turkish defence ministry declined to comment on the report. Pakistan’s information ministry did not respond to requests for comment, while Saudi officials were unavailable over the weekend.If Turkey formally joins the pact, it would highlight a new phase in relations with Saudi Arabia, once rivals for leadership of the Sunni Muslim world. After years of strained ties, the two countries are now deepening economic and defence cooperation, including holding their first-ever naval meeting in Ankara this week, according to the Turkish defence ministry.Despite shared concerns over Shiite-majority Iran, Turkey and Saudi Arabia favour engagement with Tehran rather than confrontation. They also back a stable, Sunni-led Syria and support Palestinian statehood.Turkey and Pakistan already enjoy close military ties. Ankara is building corvette warships for Pakistan’s navy, has upgraded Islamabad’s F-16 fighter jets, and shares drone technology with both Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. Bloomberg previously reported that Turkey now wants both countries to join its Kaan fifth-generation fighter jet programme.The trilateral defence discussions come after a ceasefire between India and Pakistan ended a four-day military clash and high tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May. Regional tensions remain high, however, with Pakistan and Afghanistan at odds following clashes and accusations by Islamabad that the Taliban is sheltering hostile militant groups.Turkey and Qatar have mediated talks between the sides, though those efforts have so far failed to produce a breakthrough, Bloomberg reported.","Turkey is seeking to join a defence alliance between nuclear-armed Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.

‘Not 1, Not 1,000’: Jem Chief Masood Azhar Returns With Audio Threat As India Tightens Terror Noose

Def experts: Azhar’s statement sign of post-Sindoor frustration





A new audio recording purportedly featuring Maulana Masood Azhar , the elusive chief of terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), has surfaced on social media, boasting that his organisation now commands ""thousands"" of suicide bombers who are prepared for immediate deployment.The clip has surfaced at a time when Pahalgam attack mastermind and Lashkar-e-Taiba deputy chief Saifullah Kasuri was captured on video claiming that the Pakistani army had invited him to lead the funeral prayers of its soldiers after Operation Sindoor - conducted by India in May last year following the terror attack in J&K. Both clips were posted on Telegram and X by pro-ISI accounts.The messages are being viewed as a desperate propaganda attempt to revitalize a group reeling from devastating losses inflicted by the Indian armed forces during the operation. Kasoori's speech was made from a school with hundreds of children visible in the audience while Azhar too is seemingly addressing a public gathering, sources said.In another video, Kasuri has also welcomed the growing diplomatic and military ties between Pakistan and Bangladesh. The latest recording features a defiant Azhar claiming that the sheer number of his followers would ""cause an uproar in the global media"" if fully revealed.Azhar said new recruits are driven by the obsession of attaining ""martyrdom"".Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) Masood Azhar asserts that these recruits are driven by a fanatical obsession with “martyrdom”, explicitly stating that they do not seek material comforts like cars, motorcycles or foreign visas. “They only ask Allah for one thing: martyrdom,” the UN-designated terrorist claimed, attempting to project a picture of high morale and spiritual conviction among his cadre.However, defence experts suggested this was little more than a “hollow threat” and a sign of severe frustration arising out of Operation Sindoor, a series of precision strikes by India in May 2025 that decimated JeM’s infrastructure and eliminated at least 10 of Azhar’s close relatives and top aides in Bahawalpur.“This audio appears to be a calculated effort to save face after the group’s leadership was ‘torn to pieces’, as recently admitted by other JeM commanders,” said a source. Interestingly, Azhar has not been seen in public since a 2019 blast at his Bahawalpur hideout, leading to persistent rumours about his health and location.This latest audio, while lacking visual proof of his life, indicates that the terror mastermind is still attempting to operate from the shadows, deep within a safe haven in Pakistan. Security agencies are now closely analysing voice samples and metadata of the clip to track its origin and assess the current threat level posed by the group’s surviving sleeper cells, sources said.","New audio recording purportedly featuring Maulana Masood Azhar has surfaced on social media.

Open Letter From Pakistan Backs India As Baloch Leader Signals Diplomatic Break With Islamabad





A fresh surge of enforced disappearances has been reported across Balochistan, Karachi, and adjoining regions, with nine more Baloch citizens allegedly taken away by Pakistsecurity agencies in recent weeks.Human rights defenders stated that these incidents follow a familiar pattern: individuals are arrested without warrants, held in secret locations, and never brought before a court, as reported by The Balochistan Post.According to The Balochistan Post, sources in Mand, Kech district, stated that Abdullah, son of Iqbal, was whisked away and shifted to an unknown facility. In Karachi, 24-year-old student Hamdan, son of Muhammad Ali, was detained by CTD officials in the Golimar area, with no subsequent legal proceedings or public acknowledgement of his custody.On November 2, 2025, three youths, Dawood Baloch, Usman Baloch, and Hakeem Majeed Baloch, were picked up during early-morning raids in Bhatta Colony by teams from Military Intelligence and the CTD. Their whereabouts remain undisclosed.Additional cases include the late-night detention of religious instructor Zubair from Quetta's Lak Pass area on November 20; the abduction of labourer Muhammad Iqbal Marri from outside the Rakhni Sessions Court in Barkhan on December 26; and the raid in Mastung on 11 December in which Frontier Corps and CTD personnel allegedly took 21-year-old herder Saeed Ahmed.Families say none of these detainees have resurfaced. According to another report, 17-year-old student Jamal Murad was apprehended in Gwadar on 2 January by CTD and Military Intelligence operatives, after which he disappeared.The Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP) continued its protest camp outside the Quetta Press Club, marking its 6,052nd day. Families, including the relatives of Nasreena Baloch, reportedly detained during a raid in Hub Chowki, joined the demonstration.Her family stated that local police refused to register an FIR, while the Hub Press Club was locked to stop their press briefing, as highlighted by The Balochistan Post.VBMP Chairman Nasrullah Baloch accused state institutions of weaponising national security to intensify enforced disappearances, even targeting Baloch women. He said detainees are denied legal rights, courts are bypassed, and new laws merely protect extrajudicial actions.He called on national and international bodies to take meaningful steps to end the crisis and secure the release of all missing persons, as reported by The Balochistan Post.","A fresh surge of enforced disappearances has been reported across Balochistan, Karachi, and adjoining regions.

No IMF Loan In 6 Months? Pakistan Defence Minister’s Jet Export Claim Collapses Under Debt Reality





Pakistan on Saturday claimed that Iraq has expressed “keen interest” in acquiring JF-17 Thunder fighter jets and Super Mushshak training aircraft, following talks between the air chiefs of the two countries.According to a statement issued by the Pakistan Army, air chief marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu, chief of air staff of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF), met lieutenant general staff pilot Mohanad Ghalib Mohammed Radi Al-Asadi, commander of the Iraqi Air Force, during an official visit to Iraq.The discussions focused on enhancing bilateral military cooperation, including joint training, capacity building and operational coordination.“The Iraqi air chief praised PAF’s professionalism and technological advancement, expressed interest in benefiting from PAF’s world-class training and expressed keen interest in JF-17 Thunder fighter jets and Super Mushshak trainer aircraft,” the statement said, as quoted by news agency PTI.Both sides also agreed to pursue joint exercises and training initiatives to strengthen interoperability between the two air forces.The JF-17 Thunder is a single-engine, lightweight combat aircraft jointly developed by China’s Chengdu Aircraft Corporation and the Pakistan Aeronautical Complex.Pakistan has claimed that the aircraft proved its capabilities during last year’s conflict with India, although its effectiveness remains disputed.Pakistan had also deployed Chinese-origin J-10 fighter jets during the May 7–10 hostilities with India.The development comes days after Pakistan and Bangladesh air chiefs held talks on the “potential procurement” of JF-17 jets by Dhaka. However, Bangladesh has not officially confirmed any such plan.Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif recently claimed that the country has seen increased interest in its fighter aircraft following the May 2025 standoff with India. Reports have also suggested that Pakistan is exploring similar defence deals with other countries, including Saudi Arabia, amid ongoing financial pressures.Notably, Pakistan has repeatedly relied on International Monetary Fund support in recent years, with the IMF approving a $7 billion bailout in September 2024 and an additional $1.4 billion loan in May 2025.",Iraq has expressed “keen interest’ in acquiring JF-17 Thunder fighter jets and Super Mushshak training aircraft.

Widespread protests erupted in Pakistan’s Sindh province after a young Hindu farmer was killed by a landlord in Badin.According to a report by Pakistan's news outlet the Nation, Kailash Kolhi was shot dead by an influential landlord, Sarfaraz Nizamani, over the construction of a hut on his land.Following Kolhi’s death, demonstrators staged sit-ins on the Badin–Hyderabad National Highway and the Badin–Thar Coal Road. Hundreds of vehicles remained stranded for hours as protesters demanded justice for the killing of Kolhi and vowed not to disperse until those responsible are arrested.According to a statement shared by activist Shiva Kachhi, the protest has been ongoing without pause.“The protest for the arrest of the killers of the martyred Kailash Kolhi is making history. Shiva Kachhi, Chairman of Pakistan Darawar Ittehad, is leading the historic protest sit-in. This was not just a protest—it was the cry of a wounded conscience. From 10:00 am yesterday until late into the night, the sit-in continued without pause, proving that the demand for justice cannot be silenced,” Kachhi said in a social media post on X.“Men, women, elderly people, and innocent children stayed on the streets with one voice and one demand: justice for Kailash Kolhi.Arrest the killers. Despite exhaustion, hunger, and the cold of the night, the determination of the protesters remained unshaken. Kailash Kolhi’s only ‘crime’ was that he was poor, marginalised, and courageous enough to exist in a system that protects the powerful and crushes the weak. The tears of his children, the grief of his mother, and the silent agony of his widow are today questioning the entire system: Is the blood of the poor so cheap?” he added.Earlier, the victim’s family and community members staged a protest by placing the body at Piru Lashari Stop, where the SSP Badin assured them that the accused would be arrested within 24 hours.The incident occurred four days ago in Raho Kolhi village in the Piru Lashari city area. Despite assurances from district police officials, the main accused has yet to be arrested.The ongoing protest has drawn participation from leaders and workers of several political, nationalist, religious, and social organisations, including Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI), Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), Jiye Sindh Mahaz, Qaumi Awami Tehreek, Jeay Sindh Qaumi Mahaz (Bashir Qureshi group), and Awami Tehreek, The Nation reported.","Kailash Kolhi was shot dead by an influential landlord, Sarfaraz Nizamani, over the construction of a hut on his land.

He [Netanyahu] is the biggest criminal of humanity. The world has not seen a bigger criminal.”Asif also appeared to raise the issue of penalising those he termed as enablers of such crimes, beginning a sentence with, “And what does the law say about those who support such criminals…” before the show’s anchor, Hamid Mir, interjected and called for a break.Mir warned that Asif’s remarks risked being interpreted as a veiled reference to US President Donald Trump, and indicated that Asif would not remain on air after the break.Pakistan does not have formal diplomatic relations with Israel and has historically expressed strong support for the Palestinian cause.

Gen Z uprising in Pakistan? PhD student's article challenges those in power — why it was taken down,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/gen-z-uprising-in-pakistan-phd-students-article-challenges-those-in-power-why-it-was-taken-down/articleshow/126409692.cms,"Badshahi Mosque, Lahore (AP photo)





Is Pakistan heading towards a Gen Z uprising? A PhD student from the country has sparked a debate after critically examining present-day Pakistan, under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and army chief and de facto power centre Asim Munir , without naming either directly.The piece, written through a lens that shows contrast in powerful boomer generation and youth of Gen Z-Alpha, quickly struck a chord online and became a flashpoint for what many described as a quiet rebellion. It highlighted the widening divide between Pakistan’s ruling establishment, often referred to as “Boomers,” and its increasingly restless Gen Z population.The article, titled “It is over,” was written by US-based PhD student Zorain Nizamani and published in Pakistan’s daily The Express Tribune on January 1. It was later taken down, reportedly following pressure from the Pakistani military.“For the older men and women in power, it's over. The young generation isn't buying any of what you're trying to sell to them. No matter how many talks and seminars you arrange in schools and colleges, trying to promote patriotism, it isn't working,” Nizamani wrote.Writing from the perspective of Gen Z and Generation Alpha, Nizamani rejected what he described as an imposed narrative of patriotism pushed by those in power, arguing that such efforts no longer resonate with young Pakistanis.“Young minds, the Gen Z, the alphas, they know exactly what is happening, and despite your consistent efforts of trying to 'sell' your views of patriotism to them, they are seeing right through it. Thanks to the internet, thanks to whatever little education we have left, despite your best efforts of keeping the masses as illiterate as possible, you have failed. You have failed to tell people what to think, they are thinking for themselves. They might be a little too scared to speak their minds because they prefer breathing,” Nizamani wrote.He argued that forced patriotism, speeches and seminars cannot replace justice, opportunity and basic rights, and said young people clearly see corruption, inequality and hypocrisy despite censorship and propaganda.Nizamani also highlighted generational differences over economic freedom, writing, “The Gen Z wants erased restrictions on freelancing, the boomers want to increase regulations on freelancing.”Concluding his article, he wrote: “Boomers, we have had enough.

No IMF Loan In 6 Months? Pakistan Defence Minister’s Jet Export Claim Collapses Under Debt Reality

Pakistan's repeated reliance on IMF

Bangladesh shows interest in Pak's JF-17

Pak seeks JF-17 deal with Saudi Arabia





Pakistan on Tuesday expressed confidence that it may no longer need financial assistance from the International Monetary Fund within six months, with Pakistan defence minister Khawaja Asif claiming the country had seen a surge in aircraft orders following a four-day military standoff with India in May, Geo TV reported.Speaking on a Geo News programme, Asif made a fanciful claim while arguing that the May 2025 India-Pakistan conflict showcased Pakistan's ""resolve and military effectiveness"" to the world.Military tensions escalated in May 2025 after Pakistan-sponsored terrorists carried out a terror attack in Pahalgam, killing 26 civilians in April. India responded with a strong military operation, launching Operation Sindoor, under which it targeted and destroyed multiple terror camps and Pakistani military facilities.However, Khawaja Asif, appearing disconnected from the ground reality, made such statements after a Bangladeshi defence delegation met Pakistan's air chief to discuss a potential sale of the JF-17 Thunder, the multi-role fighter aircraft jointly developed by China and Pakistan.There are also reports of talks between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia to convert about $2 billion in Saudi loans into a JF-17 fighter jet deal, according to two Pakistani sources cited by Reuters.According to Arab News, several countries have since stepped up defence engagement with Pakistan.“Right now, the number of orders we are receiving after reaching this point is significant because our aircraft have been tested,” defence minister Asif told Pakistan’s Geo News channel.“We are receiving these orders, and it is possible that after six months we may not even need the IMF,” he said.Pakistan markets the Chinese co-developed JF-17 as a lower-cost multi-role fighter and has positioned itself as a supplier offering aircraft, training and maintenance outside Western supply chains.“I am saying this with full confidence,” Asif said. “If all these orders materialise over the next six months, we will not need the IMF.”Pakistan has repeatedly turned to the International Monetary Fund over the years, for financial support to stabilise its fragile economy, with such assistance tied to strict conditions including fiscal reforms, subsidy cuts and revenue-enhancing measures.In September 2024, the IMF approved a $7 billion bailout for Pakistan under its Extended Fund Facility (EFF), followed by a separate $1.4 billion loan under its climate resilience fund in May 2025, aimed at bolstering the country’s economic stability and climate resilience.Demonstrating Dhaka’s efforts to move closer to Islamabad, Bangladesh has expressed “potential interest” in acquiring the JF-17 Thunder fighter aircraft from Pakistan, along with plans to resume direct flights between the two countries from January 29 after a gap of more than a decade.The JF-17, jointly developed by China and Pakistan, was deployed by Pakistan against India during the May 7–10 hostilities. In November last year, Indian Air Force chief Air chief Marshal A P Singh said the aircraft was among at least five high-tech Pakistani fighters shot down during Operation Sindoor.This latest development and closeness between Pakistan and Bangladesh comes under the pretext of Dhaka's straining relations with India.Pakistan and Saudi Arabia are also in talks to convert around $2 billion in Saudi loans into a JF-17 fighter jet deal, as two Pakistani sources told Reuters, in a move that would deepen military cooperation between two Islamic nations. Pakistan and Saudi signed a mutual defence pact last year.The discussions highlight efforts by the long-time allies to operationalise defence cooperation at a time when Pakistan is under acute financial strain and Saudi Arabia is recalibrating its security partnerships amid uncertainty over US commitments in the Middle East.","Pakistani defence minister Khawaja Asif says country may not need IMF help in six months.

Own goal?

Pakistan’s Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry on Tuesday said that nearly 71% of terrorist incidents reported in 2025 originated from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP). He attributed this concentration to a “politically conducive environment and the flourishing political-criminal-terror-nexus which is flourishing there”.Data released by the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) reinforces the scale of the surge. KP recorded the sharpest rise in violence, with “fatalities rose from 1,620 in 2024 to 2,331 in 2025” — a year-on-year increase of more than 40%.The broader national picture is even starker. According to the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS), 2025 was the “deadliest” year in a decade, with 3,387 combat-related deaths. These included 2,115 terrorists, 664 security personnel, 580 civilians and 28 members of pro-government peace committees. PICSS said violence intensified in both “tempo and lethality”, pushing multiple security indicators to their highest levels in years.“Militant attacks climbed to their highest annual total since 2014, and the use of suicide bombings and small drones showed a clear upward trend,” the report said.Suicide attacks rose by 53%, while terrorist incidents overall increased to 1,063 — the highest since 2014.Security forces and civilians also bore rising costs. Security personnel fatalities rose 26% to their highest level since 2011, while civilian deaths increased by 24%, marking the worst toll in a decade. Injuries surged by 53% to 2,263, with sharp rises across all categories.The violence has been most acute in KP and Balochistan. In Bannu alone, Deputy Inspector General Sajjad Khan said 27 police personnel were killed in 134 attacks during 2025. Police carried out 168 intelligence-based operations, arresting 105 militants and killing 65, he said.Pakistan frequently accuses Afghanistan’s Taliban authorities of sheltering the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a militant group blamed for a sharp increase in attacks inside Pakistan since 2021. Afghan officials reject the allegations, insisting they do not permit their territory to be used for attacks against other countries.While the TTP operates independently from Afghanistan’s Taliban, the two groups maintain close ties.Relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan have deteriorated since October, when border clashes followed explosions in Kabul on Oct. 9 that Afghan officials attributed to Pakistan. Although Qatar later helped mediate a ceasefire, talks hosted by Turkey in November failed to produce a lasting agreement.","KP recorded the sharpest rise in violence, with “fatalities rose from 1,620 in 2024 to 2,331 in 2025’ The broader national picture is even starker. 2025 was the “deadliest” year in a decade, with 3,387 combat-related deaths.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126375028,imgsize-1338682,width-400,resizemode-4/photo-credit-ap.jpg"

ISLAMABAD: The polio vaccination campaign in Pakistan's merged districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa fell short of its target, leaving over 935,000 children under five unvaccinated, officials said, citing security challenges and population displacement as key hurdles, The Express Tribune reported.According to The Express Tribune, citing authorities, thousands of families from North and South Waziristan, Bajaur, and other merged districts have migrated to different parts of the country, complicating monitoring and vaccination efforts.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Khyber Pakhtunkhwa reported 19 polio cases in 2025, including four each in North Waziristan, Lakki Marwat, and Tank; three in Bannu; two in Torghar; and one each in Dera Ismail Khan and Lower Kohistan, as reported by The Express Tribune.Officials noted that staffing and operational support for WHO and Unicef programmes in the merged districts were reduced last year, while WHO funding cuts also affected campaign coverage, leaving children in these areas at heightened risk.In Sindh, more than 12,000 children under five were reportedly missed during the final polio drive of 2025 in Hyderabad and surrounding areas, according to The Express Tribune.Refusals were recorded mainly in Cantonment areas and municipal towns such as Hussainabad, Preetabad, Qasimabad, and Tando Jam, with absent households and parental refusals cited as primary reasons.Despite these gaps, the nationwide anti-polio campaign successfully vaccinated more than 44.6 million children across Pakistan, according to The Express Tribune.Punjab led with 22.9 million children vaccinated, followed by Sindh with 10.6 million, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with 7.15 million, and Balochistan with 2.58 million.Officials said contributions from other regions also added to the national tally.Authorities warned that without sustained vaccination efforts, particularly in displaced and high-risk populations, children in the merged districts remain vulnerable to polio, The Express Tribune reported.","Polio vaccination campaign in Pakistan's merged districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa fell short of its target.

Open Letter From Pakistan Backs India As Baloch Leader Signals Diplomatic Break With Islamabad





Baloch leader Mir Yar Baloch has raised a “serious threat” warning over deepening China–Pakistan ties, claiming that China could deploy its military forces in Pakistan’s Balochistan region in the coming months.In an open letter to external affairs minister S Jaishankar, posted on X on New Year’s Day, Mir Yar Baloch said Baloch representatives view the growing strategic partnership between Islamabad and Beijing as “dangerous.”He said Balochistan has “faced decades of repression under Pakistan’s control,” including what he described as “state-sponsored violence” and “human rights abuses.”""The people of Balochistan have endured Pakistan's state occupation, state-sponsored terrorism, and egregious human rights atrocities for the past seventy-nine years. The time has now arrived to eradicate this festering affliction at its roots, ensuring lasting peace and sovereignty for our nation, "" he wrote.In his letter to EAM Jaishankar, Mir Yar Baloch said that China and Pakistan are rapidly moving toward the final stages of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a major Belt and Road Initiative project led by Chinese President Xi Jinping that passes through Balochistan.“The Republic of Balochistan views the escalating strategic alliance between Pakistan and China as profoundly dangerous.We warn that China, in collaboration with Pakistan, has advanced the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) to its final phases,” he said.He warned that unless Baloch resistance and defence forces are strengthened, the region could soon see direct Chinese military involvement.“Should the capabilities of Balochistan's defense and freedom forces not be further bolstered and if they continue to be overlooked as per longstanding patterns, it is conceivable that China could deploy its military forces in Balochistan within a few months,” the letter stated.Mir Yar Baloch also said that any Chinese troop deployment without the approval of the local people could have serious consequences for the region.“The presence of Chinese boots on Balochistani soil without the will of the 60 million Baloch people would pose an unimaginable threat and challenge to the futures of both Bharat and Balochistan,” he wrote.China and Pakistan have repeatedly rejected claims that CPEC has a military angle, saying the project is only economic. India, however, has always opposed CPEC, pointing out that it passes through Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir and affects India’s sovereignty and security.Earlier this year in the Rajya Sabha, minister of state for external affairs Kirti Vardhan Singh repeated India’s stance. In a written reply, he said: “Government's position on CPEC is clear and consistent. Government has consistently protested to parties concerned over the inclusion of the so-called 'China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)', which passes through parts of the Indian Union Territories of Ladakh and Jammu & Kashmir under illegal occupation of Pakistan, as a flagship project of 'OBOR/BRI' and asked them to cease these activities. Any proposed participation of third countries or expansion of the so-called CPEC projects to third countries is unacceptable.”Mir Yar Baloch also praised India’s recent counterterror military actions, highlighting Operation Sindoor, which targeted key terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir after the Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 people.“We commend the bold and resolute actions undertaken by the Modi Government in the previous year through Operation Sindoor, particularly targeting terrorism hubs facilitated by Pakistan and directed against the Pakistani military in response to Pahalgam terror attack. These measures demonstrate exemplary courage and a steadfast commitment to regional security and justice,” he wrote.There has been no official response so far from the Union government, or from Chinese or Pakistani authorities, to Mir Yar Baloch’s claims.",Baloch leader Mir Yar Baloch has raised a “serious threat” warning over deepening China–Pakistan ties. He claims that China could deploy its military forces in Pakistan’s Balochistan region in the coming months. China and Pakistan are rapidly moving toward the final stages of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC),"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126300692,imgsize-827347,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

I do not know how we will restore this secular country, for which it fought against Pakistan in 1971,” Nasrin said at an event in Kerala's Thiruvananthapuram,. “Now the nation is divided, and Muslim extremists are killing and persecuting religious minority communities. This must be stopped.”In recent days, and since the fall of the Sheikh Hasina–led Awami League government in August 2024, after which the caretaker administration took charge, Bangladesh has witnessed multiple incidents in which Hindus have been killed.The Yunus administration has consistently denied that minorities are under threat, stressing that not all incidents were communally motivated, and distancing itself from allegations of targeted violence.Nasrin, however, said the situation was “very bad for Hindus in Bangladesh,” accusing Yunus of failing to act against what she described as “the killers, the fundamentalists and jihadis.”She also recalled the circumstances that forced her to leave Bangladesh in 1994 following the publication of her book Lajja.“When religious fanatics and extremists threatened my life and issued fatwas against me over my books, the government at the time took no action against them and instead issued an arrest warrant against me,” Nasrin told the audience. “Had the authorities acted against the fanatics and jihadists then, the country would not be in such a bad state today. The government used religion for political interests and to stay in power as long as possible. ”Nasrin also expressed hope that Bangladesh’s next general election would be “free and fair,” adding that meaningful change would come only if a “pro-secular party” came to power.The next general election in India’s neighbouring country is scheduled for February 12.","Exiled Bangladeshi-Swedish author Taslima Nasrin alleged that Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus has aligned himself with ‘fundamentalists’ Nasrin: “The fundamentalists are in power and Dr Yunus is supporting them.

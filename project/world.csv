US president Donald Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday, implementing a 25% tariff on all foreign-manufactured automotive vehicles. The tariff will be effective from April 2.""We are going to be very fair... we are going to be nice actually. We have not been treated nicely by other countries, but we are going to be nice. I think people will be pleasantly surprised but it's going to make our country very rich,"" the president said after signing the order.The directive has prompted threats of retaliatory measures from trading partners ahead of additional trade levies scheduled for next week.Trump's earlier threat to impose tariffs on automobiles led to a significant decline in automotive shares in Asian markets at Thursday's opening. Japan's prime minister Shigeru Ishiba indicated his administration was evaluating various counter-measures.Canadian prime minister Mark Carney described Trump's tariffs as a direct attack on Canadian workers, announcing a cabinet meeting for Thursday to discuss counter-actions.In a post-announcement briefing, Peter Navarro, Trump's senior trade and manufacturing counsellor, criticised foreign trade practices that he claimed had transformed America's robust manufacturing sector into an assembly operation for imported components.He specifically criticised Germany and Japan for maintaining the production of high-value components within their borders.Since his January return to office, Trump has established new tariffs on imports from significant US trading partners including Canada, Mexico and China, alongside existing steel and aluminium duties.The latest charges will supplement existing product tariffs, although vehicles entering under the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement may qualify for reduced rates based on American content levels.Beyond the automobile industry, Trump is also considering sector-specific tariffs on pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and lumber.","US president Donald Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday, implementing a 25% tariff on all foreign-manufactured automotive vehicles.

US President Donald Trump on Wednesday rejected the allegations regarding the leaked Yemen war plans, terming it a ""witch hunt"" while supporting his defence secretary Pete Hegseth amidst Democratic demands for resignation.Trump responded after The Atlantic Magazine revealed transcripts of messages which was accidentally shared with its editor in a senior US official's Signal messaging app group.The Atlantic reported that Hegseth had shared specifics in the chat about timing of strikes on Iran-backed Huthi rebels, including details about aircraft, missiles and drones before the operations commenced.In the Oval Office, Trump told AFP that ""Hegseth is doing a great job, he had nothing to do with this,"" when questioned about Hegseth's position regarding the incident.""How do you bring Hegseth into this? Look, look it's all a witch hunt,"" Trump stated whilst addressing questions after announcing new foreign automobile tariffs.Trump maintained that no classified information was compromised, noting that National Security Advisor Mike Waltz ""took responsibility"" for the error.The incident, dubbed ""Signalgate"", occurred when Waltz mistakenly added journalist Jeffrey Goldberg to the chat, marking the most significant controversy since Trump's return to office in January.The magazine published the operation details on Thursday after the White House insisted no classified information was involved and criticised Goldberg's credibility.From Hawaii, Hegseth stated the March 15 exchange contained ""No names. No targets."" Vice President JD Vance, whilst at a Marines base near Washington, suggested the Atlantic had ""overplayed"" the situation.Secretary of State Marco Rubio acknowledged a ""big mistake"" whilst emphasising his limited involvement.Democratic leadership, particularly House leader Hakeem Jeffries, demanded Hegseth's immediate dismissal. Senator Tammy Duckworth called for removal of all chat participants.Senate Armed Services Committee's Republican chairman Roger Wicker requested an independent assessment from the Trump administration.The Atlantic detailed the chat messages, including specific launch times and operational details. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt characterised Goldberg as an ""anti-Trump hater.""Huthi media reported new US strikes on Sanaa late Wednesday, following earlier reports of 19 American operations in Yemen.

'This will hurt us': Carney on new round of tariff



'A direct attack' | Carney responds to Trump’s 25% auto tariffs

Trump announces new auto tariffs ahead of April 2 deadline



'Trump wants to break us so America can own us'



Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Wednesday called US President Donald Trump's auto tariffs a ""direct attack"" on Canada and said that the trade war is hurting Americans. He also highlighted the adverse effects of the trade dispute on Americans, evidenced by diminishing consumer confidence.Trump on Wednesday announced 25 per cent tariffs on automobile imports, declaring ""this is permanent"".""This is a very direct attack. We will defend our workers. We will defend our companies. We will defend our country,"" Carney responded.Carney indicated he need a detailed information about Trump's executive order before implementing countermeasures.He described the action as unwarranted and plans to suspend his election campaign to chair a special Cabinet committee on US relations in Ottawa on Thursday.Carney described the latest round of tariffs as both ""unjustified"" and ""inconsistent"" with the established Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement on trade.He emphasised that Canada needs to enhance its self-reliance and diversify its market presence to better protect itself from such actions.""This will hurt us but through this period, by being together, we will emerge stronger,"" Carney said.""Canadian workers, Canadians as a whole across this country have gotten over the shock of the betrayal. And are learning lessons. We have to look out for ourselves, and we have to look out for each other and work together for each other.""Trump had previously allowed a one-month exemption for Mexican and Canadian automotive imports but than on Wednesday he announced that the US will impose a 25% tariff on imported autos, a move expected to further strain relations with key trading partners just days before additional levies are set to take effect.""All cars that are not made in the United States will face a 25% tariff,"" Trump said at the White House. ""If they're made here, there will be absolutely no tariff.""The new measure, set to begin on April 2, will apply to foreign-made cars and light trucks, adding to the existing duties already placed on these goods. The decision follows a series of trade actions from the Trump administration, including tariffs on imports from major economic partners such as Canada, Mexico, and China, along with a 25% duty on steel and aluminum.Trump previously imposed 25 per cent tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium, threatening comprehensive tariffs on all Canadian goods and other trading partners by April 2.""He (Trump) wants to break us so America can own us. And it will never ever happen because we just don't look out for ourselves we look out for each other,"" Carney said.Ontario Premier Doug Ford warned that implementation of tariffs would result in simultaneous closure of automotive plants on both sides of the border.""President is calling it Liberation Day. I call it Termination Day for American workers. I know President Trump likes to tell people 'Your fired!' I didn't think he meant US auto workers when he said it,"" Ford said.Trump continues his trade offensive against Canada whilst advocating for Canadian statehood, greatly angering Canadians.Since taking office on March 14, the new prime minister hasn't communicated with Trump, an unusual circumstance in US-Canada leadership relations.""It would be appropriate that the president and I speak given the action that he has taken.

Watch: Turkish student Rumeysa Ozturk detained by federal immigration agents in masks and plain clothes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/watch-turkish-student-detained-by-ice-agents-in-masks-and-plainclothes/articleshow/119564547.cms,"Turkish student Rumeysa Ozturk being detained by ICE agents in masks

Footage shows moment ICE officials arrested Tufts University student

Who is Rumeysa Ozturk?



A Turkish doctoral student at Tufts University was detained on Tuesday by the federal immigration agents over her pro-Palestinian activism .In a surveillance video, six immigration agents could be seen in plain clothes and had covered their faces with masks when they came to detain student Rumeysa Ozturk . The officers could be seen taking away Ozturk's phone as she yelled and was handcuffed.Rumeysa Ozturk's lawyer Mahsa Khanbabai on Wednesday said that Ozturk was meeting friends for iftar, a meal that breaks a fast at sunset during Ramadan.In the video, the agents could be heard saying, ""We're the police,"" A man is heard on camera saying, ""Why are you hiding your faces?""""We are unaware of her whereabouts and have not been able to contact her. No charges have been filed against Rumeysa to date that we are aware of, Khanbabai said in a statement.Ozturk has a visa allowing her to study in the United States, Khanbabai said.The transfer of Ozturk, a PhD student at Tufts University, appeared to violate a federal court order from Tuesday, which directed the department of homeland security (DHS) and Ice to give the court 48 hours’ notice before attempting to take her out of Massachusetts.Following the discovery of Ozturk's Louisiana transfer via the online locator, the federal judge mandated DHS and Ice to address an emergency request by 9am ET on Thursday to produce Ozturk in court.A DHS representative stated to the Guardian on Wednesday that Ozturk had received ""the privilege to be in this country on a visa"" and alleged, without evidence, her support for Hamas, which governs Gaza and initiated the attack on southern Israel on October 7 2023, triggering Israel's military response.""DHS and Ice investigations found Ozturk engaged in activities in support of Hamas, a foreign terrorist organization that relishes the killing of Americans,"" the DHS spokesperson told the Guardian. ""A visa is a privilege not a right. Glorifying and supporting terrorists who kill Americans is grounds for visa issuance to be terminated. This is commonsense security.""Reuters reports suggest officials may have already cancelled Ozturk's student visa. Tufts University President Sunil Kumar confirmed the institution's non-involvement, stating they ""had no pre-knowledge of this incident and did not share any information with federal authorities prior to the event"". Ozturk, from Turkey, studies philosophy and holds a Fulbright scholarship.Earlier this month, DHS agents arrested Mahmoud Khalil, a former Columbia University graduate student, who helped organise the pro-Palestinian movement at the school and than a South Korean American student Yunseo Chung.At age 30, Ozturk holds a Fulbright Scholarship and is pursuing her doctorate in Child Study and Human Development at Tufts, with previous academic experience at Columbia University in New York, as indicated on her LinkedIn profile.In the previous year, she jointly wrote an opinion piece for the Tufts Daily, the university's student publication, expressing criticism of the institution's handling of student demands regarding divestment from Israel-linked companies and their request to ""acknowledge the Palestinian genocide.""Currently residing in the United States on an F-1 student visa, as confirmed by her legal representative Khanbabai, Ozturk was apprehended while proceeding to join companions for breaking her Ramadan fast.""Based on patterns we are seeing across the country, her exercising her free speech rights appear to have played a role in her detention,"" Khanbabai says.","Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral student at Tufts University, was detained on Tuesday by the federal immigration agents over her pro-Palestinian activism.

World's largest 'baby exporter' admits to adoption fraud,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/worlds-largest-baby-exporter-admits-to-adoption-fraud/articleshow/119564430.cms,"SEOUL: South Korea on Wednesday admitted for the first time that in its rush to send children to American and European homes decades ago, its adoption agencies committed widespread malpractices, including falsifying documents, to make them more adoptable.The findings by South Korea's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, a government agency, which said children were sent away ""like luggage"" for profit decades ago, were a hard-won victory for South Korean adoptees abroad. Many adoptees have returned to their birth country in recent years, campaigning tirelessly for South Korea to come to terms with one of the most shameful legacies of its modern history.Adoption agencies falsified documents to present babies as orphans when they had known parents, the commission acknowledged. When some babies died before they were flown overseas, other babies were sent in their names. The heads of four private adoption agencies were given the power to become legal guardians for the children, signing them away for overseas adoption.The commission's report was the government's first official admission of problems with the country's adoption practices, including the lack of oversight, even though such malpractice had been exposed in the past. The agency recommended that the state apologize for violating the rights of South Korean adoptees.South Korea is the source of the world's largest diaspora of intercountry adoptees, with around 200,000 South Korean children sent abroad since the end of the Korean War in 1953, mostly to the United States and Europe.In its destitute postwar decades, South Korea promoted overseas adoptions to find homes for orphaned, abandoned or disabled children abroad rather than build a welfare system for them at home. The government left it to the adoption agencies to find and ship children abroad for fees from adoptive families.""This is a moment we have fought to achieve: The commission's decision acknowledges what we adoptees have known for so long -- that the deceit, fraud and issues within the Korean adoption process cannot remain hidden,"" said Peter Moller, a South Korean adoptee from Denmark who led an international campaign for the commission to launch an investigation.The truth commission does not have the power to prosecute any of the adoption agencies, but the government is required by law to follow its recommendations.The adoption agencies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.","Adoption agencies falsified documents to present babies as orphans when they had known parents.

Indians on green cards are advised not to panic but to carry relevant documents when returning to the US from abroad,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/indians-on-green-cards-are-advised-not-to-panic-but-to-carry-relevant-documents-when-returning-to-the-us-from-abroad/articleshow/119419156.cms,"Checklist of documents that green card holders should carry with them for re-entry into the US



Valid and unexpired green card (Form I-551) – Ensure it is unexpired.

Passport from home country

Re-entry permit (if applicable) – Needed for those staying abroad for over one year but less than two years

Pay stubs from current employment (last 3 months)

Employment verification letter

Previous year’s W-2 form and federal income tax return copy

US bank account details

US driver’s licence

With a tough immigration policy being followed by the US government and key agencies including the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection ( CBP ), putting green card holders under heightened scrutiny; many Indians who are living and working in the US with legal permanent resident status (green cards) are worried.A recent statement by US Vice-President, JD Vance , that a green card “doesn’t give you an indefinite right to stay in the US”, has sparked concerns among thousands of Indians who are in the US on green cards. However, many experts and immigration attorneys feel that there’s no need to panic for most Indians who are on green cards and may need to travel outside the US, including on visits to India.“Though green cards can be revoked for certain reasons, including national security risks or criminal activity, most Indian professionals are law-abiding and tax-paying individuals. They don’t need to panic. As long as they follow US laws, avoid criminal activities, maintain strong ties to the US, and avoid extended stays abroad, they have little to worry about,” feels Neha Mahajan , co-founder of Skilled Immigrants in America (SIIA), an organisation supporting Indians stuck in long green card queues. She adds that green cards aren’t automatically at risk unless someone engages in actions that violate immigration rules or national security policies.The green card is a status of permanent resident in the US; hence strong ties to the US are important. “One can have multiple residences but the US government wants America to be the permanent residence of green card holders,” says Manjunath Gokare , an attorney based in Atlanta, Georgia, who specialises in immigration. Law requires that the green card holder must live in the US (maintain a home or apartment); maintain employment in the US; file income taxes in the US on all income earned globally; and maintain US bank accounts and driver’s licence.An important factor for green card status is the duration of travel outside the US and long absences are not recommended. “A stay of less than six months outside the US typically does not raise questions. A stay of more than six months but less than one year could result in additional scrutiny upon arrival in the US. A stay beyond one year without a valid re-entry permit (Form I-131) may lead to the presumption that you have abandoned your green card,” says Mumbai-based immigration lawyer, Poorvi Chothani.For green card holders, it is important to keep certain documents with them and to make sure that they are valid and updated. “Keep your green card valid and on you and renew it on time and always carry the original when you are travelling. Keep your US bank account, active health insurance, driver’s licence, and tax records up to date,” says Mahajan. She adds that green card holders should file taxes as resident (1040) and not as non-resident.Given the increased scrutiny at ports of entry, it is wise to carry certain documents for green card holders returning from overseas. “These include pay stubs from your current employment (last 3 months); employment verification letter and last year’s W-2 form and federal income tax return copy,” says Gokare.It is very important for green card holders not to have been convicted of any criminal offences (classified under US immigration laws as aggravated felonies) that render them deportable or removable, under US immigration laws.“If one is maintaining their permanent residence in the US and does not have any criminal convictions, then there is nothing to worry about. Green card holders that are targeted by CBP, typically have either residency issues or removable criminal convictions,” says Gokare. He adds that green card holders who believe that they have always complied with the law, but are yet facing issues at the port of entry, should ask the CBP officers to set up a ‘deferred inspection’.“With an appointment for deferred inspection, a green card holder is allowed to provide evidence and can be accompanied by a lawyer when they meet with CBP officers to present their case as to how they are maintaining permanent residence in the US,” he says.If faced with tough questions at a US border, green card holders are advised not to sign any forms; including Form I-407; which is the record of abandonment of legal permanent residence status; without consulting their lawyers, even if there is pressure from CBP. “No one is legally required to sign it. If they refuse, CBP cannot unilaterally strip them of their green card without due process,” says Chothani.Despite providing evidence of resident status and ties to the US, if CBP officials ask green card holders to renounce their green cards on arrival, there are still certain potential recourse measures that can be taken up.“Those who have been outside the US for an extended period should be prepared for questioning by CBP officers. If placed in secondary inspection, it is best to remain calm and provide clear responses regarding ties to the US,” says Chothani.Secondary inspections can take up to two hours to clear and Gokare advises anyone facing such inspections to co-operate with the officers and not get alarmed. Even if CBP insists that a green card holder is inadmissible or has abandoned their green card, they can still request a notice to appear before an immigration judge. This allows them to fight the case in immigration court rather than surrendering the green card at the airport.“If an individual’s green card is revoked, they may still have a few options including filing for a motion with the USCIS or immigration court to reopen or reconsider and applying for a returning resident visa to regain LPR status,” Chothani says.Finally, five years after getting their green cards, those who are eligible can consider US citizenship. “It’s the best way to make sure you don’t have to worry about losing your status,” says Mahajan. She adds that green card holders should stay engaged; follow rules and not let small mistakes put their status at risk.","A recent statement by US Vice-President, JD Vance, has sparked concerns among thousands of Indians who are in the US on green cards.

"Citing India, Trump calls for election reform in US through executive order",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/citing-india-trump-calls-for-election-reform-in-us-through-executive-order/articleshow/119546162.cms,"US president Donald Trump

TOI Correspondent from Washington:

Approvingly citing the conduct of elections in India among other countries, President Donald Trump on Tuesday issued an executive order aimed at reforming the election process in America, including a requirement for voters to prove they are US citizens when they register to vote.""Despite pioneering self-government, the United States now fails to enforce basic and necessary election protections employed by modern, developed nations, as well as those still developing. India and Brazil, for example, are tying voter identification to a biometric database, while the US largely relies on self-attestation for citizenship,"" Trump said in the order widely seen as a federal executive overreach that is certain to be challenged in courts.The US Constitution delegates power to regulate the “time, place and manner” of elections to states, with the proviso that Congress -- and not the President -- can step in and override those laws. As a result, each state has its own set of rules and regulations for elections.Although only citizens can vote in federal elections, some states require voters to provide proof of citizenship to vote, while others require voters to only sign statements swearing they are citizens. Noncitizens who sign such statements can be charged with crimes and deported. Each state, and sometimes even counties, also have their own rules pertaining to early voting, mail-in and absentee ballots, and counting procedures and schedules, all of which results in a disjointed and incohesive process.While Trump has alleged that the sketchy conduct resulted in the ""stolen election"" of 2020 -- which he claims he won -- critics say his effort at election reform is aimed at disenfranchising legitimate immigrant and minority voters to ensure Republican primacy that is being challenged by the demographic changes in American. Trump and his allies in turn allege that Democrats are bringing in hordes of illegal immigrants and registering them to vote in order to perpetuate a Democratic party rule.Elon Musk is among them. ""The goal of the Biden administration was to strategically place illegals in swing states and make their status legal, thereby turning swing states Democrat. The net result would have been permanent one-party rule of the USA, just like what they did in California,"" the South Africa-born billionaire alleged recently even though Trump acolytes have been unable to prove the charge despite strenuous efforts, ferreting out only a negligible number of bogus voting cases.While Trump embraced India's biometric push in terms of voter ID, when it come to counting though, he cited Germany and Canada's use of paper ballots, tallied in public by local officials, which he said ""substantially reduces the number of disputes as compared to the American patchwork of voting methods that can lead to basic chain-of-custody problems.""Further, while countries like Denmark and Sweden ""sensibly"" limit mail-in voting to those unable to vote in person and do not count late-arriving votes regardless of the date of postmark, many American elections now feature mass voting by mail, with many officials accepting ballots without postmarks or those received well after Election Day, the EO says, while barring states from counting mail ballots received after Election Day. Currently, 18 states count mail ballots that arrive later so long as they are postmarked by Election Day.Trump pledged to withhold federal election funding from states that do not comply with the raft of directives included in his order, saying, “Election fraud — you’ve heard the term — we’ll end it, hopefully.""",US President Donald Trump issued an executive order aimed at reforming the election process in America.

United States President Donald Trump on Wednesday said that he might give a little relaxation on tariffs to China to secure Beijing's approval for TikTok's sale.While talking to reporters at the White House, Trump said, ""Maybe I give them a little reduction in tariffs or something to get it done.""Trump said that he will have a form of deal on TikTok with China and added that if it weren't done in time, he would extend the deadline, which was scheduled for April 5. ""China is going to have to play a role in that, possibly in the form of an approval and I think they'll do that.""The fate of TikTok turned black in US after the US law ordered the application to separate from its Chinese parent company ByteDance or face a ban, due to concerns that Beijing could utilise the platform for surveillance or influence operations targeting Americans.The legislation became effective on January 19, prior to Trump's inauguration, though he subsequently issued a postponement allowing continued operations.Trump previously attempted to prohibit TikTok's US operations during his first presidential term, citing national security risks.In January, TikTok briefly ceased US operations and was removed from application stores as the deadline approached, affecting millions of users.Following his second term commencement on January 20, Trump suspended the ban's implementation for 75 days whilst seeking resolution with Beijing.TikTok resumed US services and returned to Apple and Google platforms in February.AI company Perplexity has recently declared its interest in acquiring TikTok.The company outlined plans to combine its AI search technology with TikTok's video-sharing platform in a blog post.""Combining Perplexity's answer engine with TikTok's extensive video library would allow us to build the best search experience in the world,"" the San Francisco-based organisation explained.While TikTok appears hesitant about selling, potential buyers include ""The People's Bid for TikTok,"" initiated by Frank McCourt's Project Liberty.Additional interested parties include Microsoft, Oracle and a group featuring Internet content creator MrBeast (Jimmy Donaldson).",US President Donald Trump said he might give a little relaxation on tariffs to China to secure Beijing's approval for TikTok's sale.

Ozturk has a visa allowing her to study in the United States, Khanbabai said.'This isn't public safety, it's intimidation' Neighbors said they were left rattled by the arrest, which played out at 5:30 p.m. on a residential block.""It looked like a kidnapping,"" said Michael Mathis , a 32-year-old software engineer whose surveillance camera captured the arrest. ""They approach her and start grabbing her with their faces covered. They're covering their faces. They're in unmarked vehicles.""Tufts University President Sunil Kumar said Wednesday in a statement that the school received reports that federal authorities detained an international graduate student and that the student's visa had been terminated.""The university had no pre-knowledge of this incident and did not share any information with federal authorities prior to the event,"" Kumar said.Kumar did not name the student, but university spokesperson Patrick Collins confirmed that Ozturk is a doctoral student in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.Democratic U.S. Rep. Ayanna Pressley called the arrest ""a horrifying violation of Rumeysa's constitutional rights to due process and free speech.""""She must be immediately released,"" Pressley said in a statement. ""We won't stand by while the Trump Administration continues to abduct students with legal status and attack our fundamental freedoms.""Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell called the video ""disturbing.""""Based on what we now know, it is alarming that the federal administration chose to ambush and detain her, apparently targeting a law-abiding individual because of her political views,"" she said. ""This isn't public safety, it's intimidation that will, and should, be closely scrutinized in court.""U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani issued an order giving the government until Friday to answer why Ozturk was being detained. Talwani also ordered that Ozturk not be moved outside the District of Massachusetts without 48 hours advance notice.But as of Wednesday evening, the U.S. Immigration and Custom Enforcement's online detainee locater system listed her as being held at the South Louisiana ICE Processing Center in Basile, Louisiana.A senior DHS spokesperson confirmed Ozturk's detention and the termination of her visa.""DHS and (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) investigations found Ozturk engaged in activities in support of Hamas, a foreign terrorist organization that relishes the killing of Americans. A visa is a privilege, not a right. Glorifying and supporting terrorists who kill Americans is grounds for visa issuance to be terminated. This is commonsense security,"" the spokesperson told the AP.'She's never spoken badly to anyone' Ozturk was one of four students last March who co-authored an op-ed piece in The Tufts Daily criticizing the university's response to its community union Senate passing resolutions that demanded Tufts ""acknowledge the Palestinian genocide,"" disclose its investments and divest from companies with direct or indirect ties to Israel.Friends said Ozturk was not otherwise closely involved in protests against Israel. But after the op-ed was published, her name, photograph and work history were featured by Canary Mission , a website that says it documents people who ""promote hatred of the U.S.A., Israel and Jews on North American college campuses."" The op-ed was the only cited example of ""anti-Israel activism"" by Ozturk.Students and faculty elsewhere also have recently had visas revoked or been blocked from entering the U.S. because they attended demonstrations or publicly expressed support for Palestinians. President Donald Trump 's administration has cited a seldom-invoked legal statute that authorizes the secretary of state to revoke visas of noncitizens who could be considered a threat to foreign policy interests.Hundreds of people rallied in a Somerville park to support Ozturk on Wednesday, with speaker after speaker demanding her release and accusing both major political parties of failing to protect immigrants and stand up for Palestinians.""Free Rumeysa Ozturk now,"" the crowd chanted, along with traditional protest slogans such as ""Free, free Palestine."" Many held Palestinian flags and homemade signs supporting her and opposing ICE.Before attending Tufts, Ozturk graduated with a master's degree from the Developmental Psychology program at Teachers College at Columbia University in New York, according to an alumni spotlight article in 2021.Reyyan Bilge , a psychology professor at Northeastern University and friend, described Ozturk as a ""soft spoken, kind and gentle soul"" who is deeply focused on her research and not closely involved in the campus protests.The two first met at Istanbul Sehir University, where Bilge supervised her thesis, before working together on cognitive research and co-publishing papers. They remained close after Ozturk arrived in the United States to continue her studies on a Fulbright Scholarship at Columbia in 2018.","Rumeysa Ozturk, 30, had just left her home in Somerville to meet with friends.

Court split on ruling

Administration faces scrutiny

A federal appeals court on Wednesday refused to lift an order barring US President Donald Trump's administration from deporting Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a rarely invoked wartime law.In a 2-1 decision, the US court of appeals for the district of Columbia circuit refused to overturn a March 15 order that temporarily blocks deportations under the controversial law. The administration had justified the expulsions by labeling the Tren de Aragua gang an ""invading force"" under a presidential proclamation.The justice department appealed after US district judge James Boasberg blocked further deportations and ordered that planeloads of Venezuelan migrants already removed be returned to the US. However, the administration did not comply with that order.The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed the lawsuit on behalf of five Venezuelan migrants detained in Texas, arguing that the government's actions violated due process.The case has deepened tensions between the White House and the federal judiciary, particularly as Boasberg's decision challenges the administration’s broad use of executive authority in immigration enforcement.Judges Karen LeCraft Henderson and Patricia Millett sided against lifting the order, with each writing separate concurring opinions. Judge Justin Walker, a Trump appointee, dissented.Millett, an Obama-era nominee, defended Boasberg's decision, emphasising that the ruling simply preserves the current situation while critical legal questions are examined in the upcoming hearing.""There is neither jurisdiction nor reason for this court to interfere at this very preliminary stage or to allow the government to singlehandedly moot the plaintiffs’ claims by immediately removing them beyond the reach of their lawyers or the court,"" Millett wrote.Henderson, a nominee of President George H W Bush, added that the ruling does not prevent the administration from detaining migrants but ensures they are not sent to a country they have no ties to.""Lifting the injunctions risks exiling plaintiffs to a land that is not their country of origin,"" she wrote. ""Indeed, at oral argument before this Court, the government in no uncertain terms conveyed that—were the injunction lifted—it would immediately begin deporting plaintiffs without notice.""In dissent, Walker argued that the lawsuit belongs in Texas, where the plaintiffs are detained, and warned that blocking deportations could harm sensitive foreign policy negotiations.""The government has also shown that the district court's orders threaten irreparable harm to delicate negotiations with foreign powers on matters concerning national security,"" he said.Judge Boasberg, chief of the federal district court in Washington, has indicated he will determine whether the administration defied his order by proceeding with deportations. The White House has cited ""state secrets privilege"" to withhold further details on the matter.Trump and his allies have intensified their attacks on Boasberg, with some calling for his impeachment. However, in a rare statement, chief justice John Roberts defended judicial independence , asserting that ""impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision.""The Alien Enemies Act, which allows for deportations without a court hearing, has not been used since World War II. Boasberg ruled that migrants must have an opportunity to challenge their alleged gang affiliations before being removed, arguing there is a ""strong public interest in preventing the mistaken deportation of people based on categories they have no right to challenge.""The ruling marks a significant legal hurdle for the Trump administration's immigration policies, adding another layer of complexity to the debate over executive power and due process rights for noncitizens.","Appeals court won't lift order barring deportations under wartime law.

James Boasberg back in Donald Trump's crosshairs as he takes on Signal chat leak case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/james-boasberg-back-in-donald-trumps-crosshairs-as-he-takes-on-signal-chat-leak-case/articleshow/119556219.cms,"File photo of James Boasberg (Pic credit: AP)

A newly filed lawsuit targeting US President Donald Trump's administration over leaked Pentagon plans in a Signal chat has been assigned to Judge James Boasberg , the same judge who previously halted the administration's deportation policies.The watchdog group American Oversight filed the lawsuit on Wednesday, accusing defense secretary Pete Hegseth and other officials of violating federal records laws by discussing military plans concerning Houthi attacks in a Signal group chat. The case has been randomly assigned to Boasberg, a judge serving on the US district court for Washington, DC.Republican lawmakers have strongly criticised Boasberg's involvement in the case. Senator Josh Hawley, R-Mo, condemned what he described as ""rogue judges"" like Boasberg, saying that he has introduced legislation aimed at preventing district-level judges from issuing nationwide injunctions similar to the one Boasberg previously used to block deportations.""These judges have shown they care more about obstructing President Trump's policies than applying the law correctly,"" Hawley said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""Congress has the power to change that.""Representative Darrell Issa, R-Calif, also called for Boasberg to recuse himself, arguing that the judge's alleged bias against Trump is clear.""It is no coincidence that Judge Boasberg has been assigned this case,"" Issa said. ""While I do not expect him to step aside, doing so would be the best course of action to maintain the court’s integrity.""American Oversight argues that the lawsuit revolves around the Federal Records Act , which mandates that federal officials preserve communications related to official government business. The group highlighted that agencies typically ensure message retention from apps like Signal through policies requiring messages to be forwarded to official systems or archived appropriately.The lawsuit names several high-ranking officials as defendants, including Hegseth, director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, CIA director John Ratcliffe, treasury secretary Scott Bessent, secretary of state Marco Rubio, and the national archives and records administration. It also raises concerns that Signal's auto-delete feature may have resulted in the destruction of important records in violation of federal law.Former federal prosecutor Andrew Cherkasky warned that assigning the case to Boasberg is legally contentious and could damage the credibility of the DC district court for years.""With his past controversial rulings under appellate review, allowing him to handle another case involving Trump's policies could be problematic,"" Cherkasky told Fox News Digital.Former Trump attorney Alina Habba also criticised the lawsuit, calling it an example of political bias in the judiciary.""This is yet another attempt to weaponise the judicial system against Trump's administration,"" Habba said. ""Such tactics distract from the real achievements of this administration, especially in safeguarding national security.""The White House has pushed back against allegations that the Signal group chat was used for ""war planning,"" as some reports have suggested. Gabbard, during a House Intelligence Committee hearing on Wednesday, maintained that no classified information was shared in the chat.“It was an error that a reporter was mistakenly added to a Signal chat involving senior national security officials discussing imminent strikes on the Houthis,” Gabbard said. “The National Security Advisor has taken full responsibility, and the National Security Council is conducting a thorough review to determine how this happened.”","Watchdog group American Oversight filed the lawsuit on Wednesday, accusing defense secretary Pete Hegseth and other officials of violating federal records laws.

'Thousands wishing you luck': Secret note found in CEO murder suspect Luigi Mangione's socks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/thousands-wishing-you-luck-secret-note-found-in-ceo-murder-suspect-luigi-mangiones-socks/articleshow/119555389.cms,"Luigi Mangione

A hidden note of encouragement was discovered in the socks of Luigi Mangione , the defendant in the UnitedHealthcare CEO murder case , prosecutors revealed in a court filing made public on Wednesday.According to Manhattan prosecutors, the heart-shaped note was tucked inside a pair of Argyle socks that Mangione had been given to wear to a court hearing last month. A court officer intercepted the message, which expressed support for the jailed 26-year-old, saying, ""know there are thousands of people wishing you luck.""Mangione, who is accused of fatally shooting UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson outside a midtown Manhattan hotel in December, has pleaded not guilty. The shooting occurred near the venue of an investor conference hosted by the health insurance giant. His defence team has since requested that he be allowed access to a laptop in his jail cell to review legal materials while awaiting trial.Prosecutor Joel Seidemann opposed the request, arguing it amounted to preferential treatment. He also cited previous accommodations made for Mangione, including allowing him to change out of his jail uniform for his February 21 court appearance, an option not typically extended to jailed defendants for non-jury proceedings.Mangione has developed a cult following among individuals frustrated with the US healthcare system, particularly over denied insurance claims and costly medical expenses. Dozens of supporters attended the hearing, many wearing green, the signature color of the ""Luigi"" character from the Mario Bros. video game series. One attendee even donned a green ""Luigi"" hat.Mangione himself wore a green sweater, aligning with what his sympathisers had encouraged supporters to wear, Seidemann noted in the filing.Prosecutors further disclosed that another heart-shaped note, addressed to an individual named ""Joan,"" was also found hidden within the socks' packaging. The sender's identity remains unknown. While Mangione initially put on the socks, he later removed them, allegedly saying, ""they did not look good.""During the hearing, he appeared in court wearing loafers, with his bare ankles shackled.Beyond the Manhattan murder charges , Mangione faces federal charges related to Thompson’s killing, as well as additional state gun possession and other offenses in Pennsylvania. He has yet to enter pleas in those cases.","Luigi Mangione is accused of fatally shooting UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.

Uncertain circumstances surrounding the incident

Four US army soldiers were found dead in Lithuania after disappearing during a training exercise near the border with Belarus, NATO secretary general Mark Rutte confirmed on Wednesday.The soldiers, assigned to the 1st Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division from Fort Stewart, Georgia, were last seen on Tuesday operating an armored vehicle as part of a tactical exercise near Pabrade, an area approximately six miles from the Belarusian border.“This is tragic news, and our thoughts are with the families and loved ones of these brave soldiers,” Rutte said during a visit to Warsaw, Poland. “At this stage, details remain unclear.”The US army has yet to issue an official statement regarding the circumstances of their deaths. However, prior to the tragic discovery, the Army had expressed gratitude to Lithuanian forces for their assistance in the search-and-rescue efforts.“I would like to personally thank the Lithuanian Armed Forces and first responders who quickly came to our aid,” Lt general Charles Costanza, V Corps commanding general, said in a statement. “This teamwork underscores the strength of our partnership, regardless of the flags we wear on our shoulders.”The missing soldiers were reportedly traveling in an M88A2 Armored Recovery Vehicle when they vanished around 7 pm local time on Tuesday, according to Lithuanian media. A large-scale search operation was launched, involving Lithuanian troops, Nato forces, Lithuanian Air Force helicopters, and the country’s State Border Guard Service.By Wednesday, Lithuanian officials had identified a probable location of the incident. “The possible location of the incident has been identified, and search and rescue is underway,” Lithuanian military spokesman Major Gintautas Ciunis said.While the exact cause of the soldiers’ deaths remains unknown, Lithuanian military officials have refrained from speculation. “Such incidents, while rare, do occur during large-scale military exercises,” said Giedrimas Jeglinskas, chairman of Lithuania’s National Security and Defense Committee. “Lessons will be learned, and safety measures will be reinforced.”","Four US army soldiers were found dead in Lithuania after disappearing during a training exercise near the border with Belarus.

Pakistani YouTube star Rajab Butt has been charged with blasphemy following the launch of his perfume named ""295"", a reference to Pakistan’s controversial blasphemy laws.The case was filed after his video promoting the fragrance sparked outrage, particularly from the hardline Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), which places blasphemy at the core of its political agenda.Butt, who boasts millions of followers online, announced the perfume in a now-deleted video, referencing Section 295 of Pakistan’s penal code, which deals with blasphemy. The move triggered widespread condemnation, with TLP leader Haider Ali Shah Gillani filing a formal complaint against him on Monday.""There are numerous sections in the penal code, but why did he choose blasphemy-related sections to name a perfume?"" Gillani was quoted by the news agency AFP, accusing Butt of attempting to ""normalise"" disrespect towards religious laws.According to AFP, the police charge sheet confirms that Butt has been charged under both blasphemy and cybercrime laws. If convicted, he faces up to 10 years in prison.As the controversy increased, Butt released an apology video on Sunday, holding a Quran as he sought forgiveness. ""I apologise for the words I uttered during the launch of the perfume,"" he said. He also announced the immediate discontinuation of the product.The controversy also relates to the late Indian rapper Sidhu Moose Wala ’s song ""295,"" which also referenced blasphemy laws. Butt had previously likened himself to Moose Wala, claiming they both faced persecution under similar legal provisions, according to Daily Pakistan.This is not Butt’s first legal battle. In January, he pleaded guilty to illegally owning a lion cub, which he had received as a wedding gift.A Pakistani court ordered him to create 12 educational videos on animal welfare as part of his punishment. He avoided jail time by pledging to use his platform to raise awareness about responsible treatment of wild animals.Blasphemy remains an extremely sensitive issue in Pakistan, where accusations, often unverified, can lead to mob violence and even killings.The legal provisions under Section 295 have been widely criticised by human rights groups for being used as a tool to target individuals, including religious minorities and public figures.","Pakistani YouTube star Rajab Butt has been charged with blasphemy following the launch of his perfume named ""295,"" a reference to Pakistan’s controversial blasphemy laws.

QUETTA: The Balochistan government , under the leadership of chief minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti , has decided to take stringent measures against government employees involved in anti-state activities , as reported by ARY News.In a high-level meeting chaired by CM Bugti, which was attended by the IG Balochistan and the chief secretary, the government announced that it would target individuals involved in anti-state propaganda and activism.According to ARY News, CM Bugti instructed all commissioners and district officers to act swiftly against any government employees suspected of promoting anti-state narratives or participating in activities that challenge the state's authority. The government's move appears to be a direct attempt to suppress activism and dissent within the province, especially among those critical of the state's policies. Bugti also confirmed that individuals involved in such actions would be placed under strict surveillance by being added to the Fourth Schedule for closer monitoring.ARY News also reported that CM Bugti directed all heads of educational institutions in the province to ensure the national flag is hoisted and the national anthem is recited regularly. Educational leaders who fail to enforce these directives are being told to resign, which signals a heightened crackdown on any form of resistance within these spaces.This renewed focus on stifling activism in Balochistan reflects the government's broader strategy to assert control over the region, including monitoring and potentially silencing any opposition to its policies.This comes amidst the detention of Baloch leaders and activists. Activists in the Balochistan region have frequently organised protests and campaigns, calling attention to the region's marginalisation.In response, governments have implemented harsh crackdowns, often leading to the detention of Baloch leaders and activists. These actions have sparked widespread criticism from international human rights organisations, highlighting concerns over the suppression of political expression and the stifling of peaceful advocacy for regional rights.","The Balochistan government has decided to take stringent measures against government employees involved in anti-state activities.

Who is Mahrang Baloch?



Growing Baloch resistance



Challenging the narrative



Balochistan, a region rife with conflict, has become a powder keg as Pakistan confronts a growing insurgency and resistance movement, most recently illustrated with the hijacking of a train by the Balochistan Liberation Army.The shock attack resulted in around 60 deaths and brought to fore the boiling deep-seated tensions between the Baloch people and the Pakistani state.Following the attack, senior Pakistan ministers and army leaders held a special meeting to address the country's worsening security crisis.The Pakistan 'establishment', referring to the army, also turned its eyes towards more legitimate forms of protest.Pakistan police recently detained Mahrang Baloch , a leading human rights advocate and symbol of Baloch aspirations, igniting further unrest.Pakistan views the Baloch movement with increasing alarm, fearing the rise of separatist sentiments and challenges to its authority in the region, particularly because of Balochistan's vast area and crucial borders with hostile countries like Iran and Taliban-led Afghanistan.The arrest of nearly 150 activists, including Mahrang Baloch -- recognised by Time Magazine as one of its 100 Next Emerging Leaders -- has sparked international condemnation and raised concerns about human rights abuses and the suppression of Baloch voices in Pakistan.Pakistani authorities arrested Mahrang on Saturday under charges of terrorism, sedition, and murder after a protest in Balochistan's capital, Quetta, resulted in the deaths of three protesters.Mahrang Baloch, a medical doctor and leader of the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC), has been vocal about enforced disappearances and alleged extrajudicial killings in Balochistan.Her sister, Iqra Baloch, condemned her arrest, stating on social media that her visit to Hudda Jail was reminiscent of when she saw her father behind bars 18 years ago. “Back then, Mahrang was by our side. Today, she is not,” she wrote.Mahrang has been a key figure in protests against enforced disappearances. Her father, Abdul Gaffar Langove, a nationalist leader, was forcibly disappeared in 2009, and his body was found three years later in Lasbela district, according to BBC.Since then, she took the decision to fight against enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings. Now, the 32-year-old is continuing activism despite odds thrown at her, which include death threats, travel bans, detention etc.In December 2023, she helped organise a major march to Islamabad calling for action against enforced disappearances, which was met with police crackdowns.Mahrang's family has also alleged that authorities have denied them permission to meet her in jail or deliver food.Support for the Baloch resistance, both violent and non-violent, has been growing, especially among the youth.Many have been radicalised by ongoing human rights abuses in Balochistan, where an anti-insurgency crackdown — dubbed Pakistan's ""secret dirty war"" — has led to thousands of enforced disappearances and killings over two decades.Voice for Baloch Missing Persons reports that since 2009, around 1,500 missing individuals have been found dead, often brutally tortured, while 6,000 remain missing.Human rights groups say extrajudicial killings are rising, but the military denies involvement.Faith in political solutions has also eroded after allegations of military interference in the 2018 and 2024 elections, which sidelined popular Baloch nationalist leaders.Pakistan has been battling a separatist insurgency in Balochistan for years, with militant groups targeting security forces and foreign nationals.Authorities have often pointed towards the terror activities of the BLA to justify brutal crackdown, arrests and torture of Baloch residents.A major part of the Maharang's movement, however, is based on peaceful advocacy, which observers say presents a challenge to the state's narrative.The province, which is also the poorest, accounts for the lion's share of Pakistan’s total landmass but only 6% of its population, has been a site of insurgency and heavy military presence for decades.Activists claim that Islamabad suppresses political voices while exploiting the region's natural resources.Human rights groups argue that her arrest is part of a broader crackdown on Baloch activists. Protests, often led by women, continue in various parts of Balochistan demanding her release.The Pakistani government has not yet responded to calls for transparency regarding the charges against her.The arrest of Mahrang Baloch has scaled-up scrutiny of Pakistan’s policies in Balochistan, with rights groups calling for an independent investigation into the recent protests and the treatment of activists in the region.","Mahrang Baloch, a medical doctor and leader of the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC), has been vocal about enforced disappearances and alleged extrajudicial killings in Balochistan.

My friends, those who once collaborated in the massacre, are now speaking louder than ever,” Fakhrul said in Dhaka.The statement, purportedly made with an eye on national elections expected be held during the year-end, seems to hint at change of stance of the party whose cadres have been active participants in anti-Mujib protests across country and abroad, including removing his portrait from Darbar Hall of the President’s office & destroying his residence at Dhanmondi 32.Fakhrul said people involved in mass killings during war of independence are now speaking openly and attempting to distort history. Fakhrul stressed the importance of preserving the nation’s history, noting that many younger generations are unaware of significant historical events.Bangladesh Tuesday said it was awaiting a response from New Delhi to its proposal for a meeting between Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus and PM Narendra Modi on the sidelines of BIMSTEC Summit in Bangkok next week, reports Ahsan Tasnim.

Muhammad Yunus claims 'spread of false information' to 'destabilize' Bangladesh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/muhammad-yunus-claims-spread-of-false-information-to-destabilize-bangladesh/articleshow/119488827.cms,"Muhammad Yunus (File photo)

The Chief Adviser to Bangladesh's interim government, Muhammad Yunus , addressed concerns about the proliferation of misinformation since the interim government assumed office, noting a significant increase in rumours across various media platforms.In his address to the nation on the eve of Independence Day and Eid-ul-Fitr celebrations, he warned about deliberate attempts to destabilise the country through false information, as reported by the Dhaka Tribune. He cited examples of manipulated images and misattributed incidents being circulated to create social unrest. He said, ""To destabilize the country, false information is being spread one after another to confuse the public. Rumors are being spread through innovative methods, such as combining one image with another, creating photo cards with one event and passing off another country's incident as our own, causing a stir on social media. As the election approaches, this will only get worse. You all know who is behind this and why.""Speaking about the July uprising, he emphasised that its first phase had concluded successfully, with the second phase now commencing. He stressed the importance of remaining vigilant against rumours, saying, ""The first phase of the July uprising has been successfully completed. With the end of the first phase, the second phase of the uprising has begun. We must always remember that we are in a state of war. Rumors' are the most powerful weapon of the defeated forces against the July uprising. Whenever you encounter a rumor, you must trace its source. Do not ignore rumors.""""Many experienced military experts are working behind these rumors day and night, with unlimited funds invested. Their main goal is to defeat the July uprising, but we will not let that happen,"" he added.Meanwhile, in a separate development regarding technological advancement, Dr Yunus announced ongoing negotiations with Elon Musk's Starlink, anticipating finalisation within three months.Yunus also talked about internal problems of the nations, citing corruption as harmful. ""Just like the people of the country, the international community wants us to be free from corruption because they want to expand trade with us. Without eradicating corruption, business and trade will not progress. There is no future for Bangladesh without being free from corruption,"" he said.Further emphasising commitment to a corruption-free administration, Yunus stated they aim to ""keep the current government term free from corruption"" while ensuring citizens remain protected from ""corruption fostered by government patronage in the future.""Regarding politically motivated cases, he mentioned that ""6,295 cases of politically motivated harassment filed during the previous fascist government's tenure have been recommended for withdrawal,"" with other similar cases being addressed gradually. During his address, Yunus also shared a positive outlook regarding inflation control, anticipating a reduction to under 8% by June. He noted that ""In February, inflation dropped to 9.32%, the lowest in 22 months, and we expect it to fall further in the coming months.""He also accused the previous administration of misappropriating $234 billion over the past 15 years, alleging cases of money laundering, including one instance where $33.3 million was transferred to a child's bank account under the guise of educational expenses.","Muhammad Yunus, Chief Adviser to Bangladesh's interim government, addressed concerns about the proliferation of misinformation since the interim government assumed office.

Concerns are rising about potential martial law or emergency rule in Bangladesh , with discussions about military intervention becoming more prominent. There are reports on social media that the armed forces might act against the Muhammad Yunus-led interim administration amidst escalating friction between the military, government, and student movements.The reported presence of Bangladeshi Army units in Dhaka has intensified coup speculation. Intelligence suggests that military personnel from the 9th Division, based in Savar, are systematically moving into the capital. Media outlet IANS reported that security sources indicate the army's intention to strengthen its authority, especially in Dhaka.The speculations are being fuelled further by a video of the army chief from last month. Army Chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman had expressed concern that Bangladesh's independence could be at risk if people continued their divisive behaviour and mutual criticism. ""I am warning you. If you cannot forget your differences and work together, if you engage in mudslinging and fighting, the independence and sovereignty of this country and nation will be at stake,"" he said. Further continuing his warning, he added, ""I am telling you today, otherwise you would say that I did not warn you. This country belongs to all of us. We all want to live in peace and harmony. We do not want conflicts or fights. We are working towards that goal.""Amid the widespread speculation, the army has, however, denied any such reports. Army Chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman rejected these claims on Monday and called for calm. Speaking to senior military officials at the 'Officer's Address' in Dhaka Cantonment, General Waker praised the forces' commitment, expertise, and strength, highlighting the importance of not being swayed by false information, as reported by Daily Star. His address followed extensive overnight speculations about potential martial law or emergency measures amidst ongoing political developments.General Waker highlighted critical issues, including public safety concerns, the spread of false information, and provocative statements.

UK set to cut public spending by billions of pounds,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-set-to-cut-public-spending-by-billions-of-pounds/articleshow/119527734.cms,"Britain's finance minister Rachel Reeves is set to detail billions of pounds of spending cuts in her Spring Statement on Wednesday to address the country's ailing public finances.The spending update comes as the Labour government, elected in July after a landslide election win, faces sluggish economic growth and rising borrowing costs.In a glimmer of good news, Britain's annual inflation rate eased to 2.8 percent in February, down from 3.0 percent in January, according to the Office for National Statistics.But despite the slowdown, inflation remains elevated above the Bank of England's two percent target. The central bank kept interest rates unchanged last week after a series of cuts, warning of ""economic uncertainty"".Reeves has warned that since her inaugural budget in October, ""the world has changed.""Heightened global uncertainty over US tariffs and the war in Ukraine have added to the UK's economic woes, chipping away at the Labour government's £9.9 billion ($12.8 billion) fiscal cushion.Prime Minister Keir Starmer has recently pledged to hike spending on defence, with the government announcing late Tuesday a £2.2 billion boost next year.""This moment demands an active government stepping up to secure Britain's future,"" Reeves said in a press statement ahead of the fiscal update.An advocate of iron discipline over public finances, Reeves is set to detail cuts to welfare payments and government departmental budgets in Wednesday's highly-anticipated update.An accompanying forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility, the country's spending watchdog, is expected to paint a gloomy picture of the outlook for the UK economy.""The Chancellor (Rachel Reeves) is unlikely to announce much today that will help quell the fears around the UK economy,"" commented Lindsay James, investment strategist at wealth management firm Quilter.""Economic growth is miniscule and risks going backwards,"" she added.Reeves's attempts to shore up the public purse are constrained by her own fiscal rules and her pledge not to increase taxes, raising the prospect of spending cuts.The rules prevent her from borrowing to fund day-to-day spending and call for debt to fall as a share of the gross domestic product by 2029-2030.The centre-left government has already announced it will slash the costs of running the government by 15 percent over the next five years, targeting annual savings of over £2 billion across Britain's civil service.It also announced contested cuts to disability welfare payments, in the hopes of saving more than £5 billion annually by the end of the decade.While Labour has highlighted increased funding for housing, the struggling National Health Service, and reforms to workers' rights, it is spending cuts that have remained in the spotlight.The cuts add to criticism piled on Labour after it scrapped a winter-fuel benefit scheme for millions of pensioners last year.The update also comes ahead of a business tax hike, announced in Labour's inaugural budget, coming into effect in April.Businesses heavily criticised the tax increase, warning about the adverse effects on hiring and wages.","Britain's finance minister Rachel Reeves set to detail billions of pounds of spending cuts in her Spring Statement on Wednesday.

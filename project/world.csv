Minneapolis: ICE Vehicles Attacked, Protests Erupt After Immigration Agent Kills American Woman

What is happening in Minneapolis?







An ICE officer in its major immigration crackdown fatally shot a woman driving an SUV through her car window in South Minneapolis on Wednesday. US President Donald Trump called the incident ""horrible thing to watch"" and said that the woman was ""a professional agitator.""The deadly confrontation escalated the intensity of situation in what was already heated-up immigration raid on Minnesota and its immigrants by Donald Trump administration. The administration confirmed the shooting and also informed that the woman was a rioter who in her vehicle attempted to run over law enforcement officers.A video of the incident immediately surfaced widely over social media, showing a Honda SUV apparently blocking unmarked law enforcement vehicles as they attempt to drive down a street that was covered with snow.The driver, identified by local media as 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good, tried to drive away as officers approached and attempted to open her door, prompting one agent to fire three shots as the vehicle pulled off.In the video, an officer is heard ordering the driver to get out of the car and attempting to open the door, after which the driver slowly reverses and then moves forward as if trying to flee. An officer positioned at the front fires three shots, and the SUV travels a short distance at point-blank before crashing into a parked car.The woman was taken to Hennepin County Medical Center, where she was pronounced dead, according to the Minneapolis police chief.Trump, who has ordered nationwide anti-immigration raids, accused the woman of trying to “viciously” run over the agent. Trump reacted to the event, taking to his Truth Social, he wrote: ""I have just viewed the clip of the event which took place in Minneapolis, Minnesota. It is a horrible thing to watch. The woman screaming was, obviously, a professional agitator, and the woman driving the car was very disorderly, obstructing and resisting, who then violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer, who seems to have shot her in self defense. Based on the attached clip, it is hard to believe he is alive, but is now recovering in the hospital.He further added in the post, ""The situation is being studied, in its entirety, but the reason these incidents are happening is because the Radical Left is threatening, assaulting, and targeting our Law Enforcement Officers and ICE Agents on a daily basis. They are just trying to do the job of MAKING AMERICA SAFE. We need to stand by and protect our Law Enforcement Officers from this Radical Left Movement of Violence and Hate!""ICE's federal agents have played a central role in the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement and deportation push, despite objections from some local officials.Last summer, the department of homeland security (DHS) launched an aggressive recruitment drive to add 10,000 ICE agents to its existing force of about 6,000, drawing criticism that newly deployed officers lacked adequate training.DHS secretary Kristi Noem said “any loss of life is a tragedy” but described the incident as “domestic terrorism,” alleging that Good had been stalking and obstructing ICE operations throughout the day. She said Good later “weaponized her vehicle.”The incident took place during protests against immigration enforcement in southern Minneapolis, in the midwestern state of Minnesota.DHS, which oversees ICE, said in a post on X that the woman had attempted to run over an officer, who then fired what it described as ""defensive shots.""The administration deployed hundreds of agents to the city on Wednesday in what officials described as the largest crackdown since a Minnesota welfare fraud case drew national attention. Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey said he was aware of the shooting involving an ICE agent and called for federal immigration officers to leave the city “immediately.”“The presence of federal immigration enforcement agents is causing chaos in our city,” Frey said in a statement on social media. “We’re demanding ICE leave the city immediately. We stand rock solid with our immigrant and refugee communities.”Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, who withdrew from the governor’s race following the welfare controversy, said his office was working to “gather information on an ICE-related shooting this morning.”","US President Donald Trump called the incident ""horrible thing to watch"" and said that the woman was ""a professional agitator"" The driver, identified by local media as 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good, tried to drive away as officers approached and attempted to open her door.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126405732,imgsize-1181996,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order directing the withdrawal of Washington from 66 international organisations, conventions and treaties. The White House said continued participation in these bodies was deemed “contrary to the interests” of the country.The order, signed on Wednesday, covers 35 non-UN organisations and 31 United Nations entities, marking one of the largest rollbacks of US engagement with multilateral institutions in recent years.Announcing the decision, the White House said the move was guided by the administration’s “America First” policy. In a post on X, it said, “Today, President Donald J Trump signed a Presidential Memorandum directing the withdrawal of the United States from 66 international organizations that no longer serve American interests”.According to the executive order, Trump instructed all executive departments and agencies to take immediate steps to put into effect the withdrawals as soon as possible. For UN entities, withdrawal would involve ending participation or funding, to the extent permitted under US law.The memorandum said the decision was taken after reviewing a report submitted by the Secretary of State and after consultations with Cabinet members.It concluded that US participation or financial support for these organisations was redundant, wasteful, mismanaged or misaligned with national priorities and in some cases posed a threat to US sovereignty and prosperity.“The Trump Administration has found these institutions to be redundant in their scope, mismanaged, unnecessary, wasteful, poorly run, captured by the interests of actors advancing their own agendas contrary to our own, or a threat to our nation’s sovereignty, freedoms, and general prosperity,” the State Department said in a statement.Among the non-UN organisations, the US will exit several major climate, environment and energy-related bodies. This includes the India- and France-led International Solar Alliance, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).Other bodies include the International Renewable Energy Agency, International Energy Forum, Global Counterterrorism Forum, Partnership for Atlantic Cooperation and several regional and development-focused institutions.On the UN side, the withdrawals include agencies dealing with economic development, climate change, gender equality, population, peacebuilding and water. This includes organizations such as the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), UN Population Fund, UN Women, UN Energy and UN Water.The decision comes nearly a year after the Trump administration withdrew the United States from the World Health Organization (WHO) in January 2025, citing the agency’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. The US also exited Unesco in July 2025, arguing that continued membership was not in the country’s national interest.The administration had also suspended support for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa). These moves reflected Washington’s increasingly selective, a-la-carte approach to multilateral engagement, under which the administration chose to fund and participate only in institutions it believed aligned with President Trump’s agenda and US interests.Experts and former officials have warned that the decision could weaken global cooperation on climate change, public health and development. Scientists said that the US withdrawal from climate-focused bodies may slow international efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions and address extreme weather events.“The US withdrawal could hinder global efforts to curb greenhouse gases because it gives other nations the excuse to delay their own actions and commitments,” said Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson.The UN Population Fund, another key exit, has long faced opposition from Republican leaders. Trump previously cut its funding during his first term, alleging involvement in coercive abortion practices. However, the claims were later rejected by a US State Department review.Analysts said that the move reflects a broader shift in Washington’s approach to multilateralism. “I think what we’re seeing is the crystallization of the US approach to multilateralism, which is ‘my way or the highway. It's a very clear vision of wanting international cooperation on Washington’s own terms,” said Daniel Forti of the International Crisis Group.Despite the withdrawals, US officials have said that Washington will continue to engage selectively in global institutions where it sees strategic competition with China, such as in telecommunications, maritime and labour-related bodies.These include bodies focused on climate, energy, democracy, culture and regional cooperation, such as:","US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order directing the withdrawal of Washington from 66 international organisations, conventions and treaties.

"Is the Daily Wire using Candace Owens’ past to stay relevant? Podcaster Melissa Witte blasts the network as a “sad, psycho ex”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us-streamers/is-the-daily-wire-using-candace-owens-past-to-stay-relevant-podcaster-melissa-witte-blasts-the-network-as-a-sad-psycho-ex/articleshow/126404360.cms,"Candace Owens and The Daily Wire's fallout has intensified as the network plans to revive her former podcast using archived material. This move has drawn sharp criticism from podcaster Melissa Witte and Owens herself, who liken the situation to a ""crazy ex"" behavior, raising questions about the network's motives and control in digital broadcasting.

Backlash grows after Daily Wire quietly relaunches Candace Owens’ former podcast





The fallout between Candace Owens and The Daily Wire has taken a sharp new turn, and this time the backlash is not coming from Owens alone. A decision tied to her former podcast has ignited criticism across the media space, raising uncomfortable questions about ownership, control, and motive in digital broadcasting.The controversy gained traction after claims surfaced that the network plans to revive Owens’ former show using archived material. While the brand still owns the rights, the move struck many as aggressive rather than strategic. Among the loudest voices pushing back is podcaster Melissa Witte, who did not hold back in her reaction.In a January 6 post on X, Witte accused the Daily Wire of clinging to Owens’ influence instead of building something new. She wrote, ""So the Daily Wire is going to relaunch Candace’s podcast- the one they still own the rights to- but in place of Candace they’re going to have a pickme intern who will simply recap Candace’s latest show and make fun of it.""Her criticism escalated from there. ""Do you understand how sad and pathetic you have to be as a media company to lose your most popular host and instead of simply reflecting on that and working to produce better content, you take the sad, psycho, ex-boyfriend route and just draft off her wake instead? Like… what’s next? You losers gonna key her DW anniversary into the driver’s side door of her car? WTAF? Who does crazy sh*t like this???""Owens echoed that sentiment on her current podcast, describing the experience as unsettling rather than professional.She explained, ""About an hour before we went live, a bunch of people were messaging me saying that the daily wire had brought back my old YouTube channel they had seemingly deleted.""She later compared the situation to a breakup that never truly ended. ""I genuinely feel like when you break up with someone and you have a crazy ex, that was how it felt like being fired from Daily Wire.""Owens also alleged ongoing pressure behind the scenes. ""In a normal world, your employer, if they fire you, that should be the last you hear of them.""The Daily Wire has not publicly responded to the criticism. What remains clear is that the relaunch has reopened old wounds and shifted the narrative away from content and toward intent.Also Read: “Crazy ex-stalker”: Candace Owens accuses The Daily Wire of “toxic” behavior nearly two years after her dismissal",Daily Wire quietly relaunches Candace Owens' former podcast using archived material.

MrBeast expressed interest in investing in smaller creators like Clavicular for growth potential. Clavicular's hesitation stemmed from concerns about losing his genuine persona, even for a lucrative deal.

Clavicular turns down MrBeast deal, says going “full PR” isn’t worth the money





In one of the videos that have spread on social media, a new chapter in creator culture has been reopened: where fame and money collide, which control is excessive. This time, the attention is focused on the up-and-coming streamer Clavicular and the concept of collaborating with a YouTube star MrBeast. The conversation gained momentum when remarks of MrBeast alluded to the reason why smaller and less predictable creators tend to appeal to him more than already-established stars.What followed was not a polished announcement or brand deal tease. Instead, it was a raw, unfiltered look at how creators really think behind the scenes. Fans quickly latched onto Clavicular’s hesitation, not because of the money involved, but because of what he might lose in the process.MrBeast explained his thinking clearly when discussing potential investments in creators. He said, “it would make no sense to invest in Speed, because Speed's already huge, right? So, I mean, you can't get much bigger than that. I would need to invest in someone smaller, so I can get some upside, right?”He added, “So, like, the upcoming streamers are content creators. Yeah, let me think. I mean, if I were to, like, who I think will keep getting attention, I think that Clav guy, the LuxMaxxer, I think he'll keep getting attention, because he really leans into doing ridiculous things that, you know, gets out there. Clavicular!”That praise soon turned into speculation during a separate exchange between Clavicular and fellow streamer N3on. Reacting in disbelief, Clavicular asked, “He's trying to sign me? What the ?” When N3on followed up with, “Would you let Mr. Beast be your manager for 10%?” the answer initially sounded open. “For 10%? Yeah, that's probably good. But wait, would he stop making me do everything that makes me like me?”The tone shifted once branding entered the picture. After being told, “You'd have to go full PR,” Clavicular shut it down. “That's not worth it. I don't know. I've crashed out over sponsorships and blown up deals before, so I don't know. I don't want to have to be like PR and fake s***, you know?”For many fans, that honesty resonated. In an era where creator polish often replaces personality, Clavicular’s response highlighted a growing resistance to trading authenticity for structure, even when the offer comes from the top.Also Read: Clavicular sparks major backlash after claiming women with “15 bodies” are unable to truly form emotional bonds","Up-and-coming streamer Clavicular declined a potential collaboration with YouTube star MrBeast.

Brandon Tatum criticizes Megyn Kelly for staying neutral on Donald Trump and Venezuela

Brandon Tatum did not hold back. On his January 6 podcast, the conservative podcaster sharply criticized Megyn Kelly after she refused to fully support President Donald Trump’s comments on Venezuela. Tatum said Kelly’s decision to stay neutral showed weak leadership. He made it clear that he no longer supports her work and has unfollowed her.The clash started after Kelly discussed Trump’s recent remarks about possible U.S. action in Venezuela. On her show, Kelly said she wanted to stay in what she called “yellow light territory.” She said she needed more facts before cheering or condemning any move. She also warned against celebrating foreign action too early, saying past examples had ended badly. Brandon Tatum strongly disagreed. He said staying in the middle during serious moments is wrong. He argued that leaders must take clear positions, even when outcomes are uncertain.Brandon Tatum said Megyn Kelly’s stance showed fear of public backlash. Speaking directly to his audience, he said, “I’m going to tell you how fake these people are. They want to play in the middle because ‘I don’t want to be wrong.’ You do what you need to do in good faith and do the best you can.”Tatum then added a line that sparked strong reactions online. He said, “That’s why, and I’m not saying women, but woman like this can’t lead.” He explained that leaders cannot wait for perfect answers before acting.Megyn Kelly had earlier explained why she refused to jump on what she called the “rah-rah train.” On her podcast, she said past foreign policy moves that were celebrated early later caused regret. She also stressed concern for families. After President Donald Trump said on January 3 that he would not rule out “boots on the ground” in Venezuela, Kelly responded, “Whose boots? Because I have a 16-year-old boy, a 12-year-old boy, and a 14-year-old girl, and a lot of my listeners have children too, who are actually the ones who might have to fill the boots. ”Tatum rejected that fear. He said the situation would not lead to a military draft. He told listeners, “People don’t sign up for the military to sit on a base every day. You sign up to fight for the country. You don’t get to pick which war you go to.”To explain his point, Tatum used a simple example. He said if a car breaks down, it does not mean people should stop driving forever. It means they need a better car. He also said he trusts Trump’s record, stating that the president acts in good faith and does not push regime change lightly.Still, Brandon Tatum added that his support is not blind. He said he would back Donald Trump when he believes the president is right and speak out when he believes he is wrong.Also Read: “Who Killed Charlie Kirk?”: Theo Von Stirs Debate With Candace Owens Kids Joke During Widely Shared Podcast Episode",Conservative podcaster Brandon Tatum sharply criticized Megyn Kelly after she refused to fully support President Donald Trump’s comments on Venezuela.

Step by step compliance instructions





Saudi Arabia is stepping up efforts to increase local workforce participation in specialized jobs. The Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development has unveiled two major decisions that set higher saudization targets and introduce minimum wage standards, aiming to create better opportunities for citizens in vital sectors.Saudization, or “Nitaqat,” is a national policy designed to increase the employment of Saudi citizens across public and private sectors. Its goal is to reduce reliance on expatriate labor and ensure that Saudi nationals are well-represented in key professions. The policy sets specific targets for businesses, requiring them to employ a certain percentage of Saudi workers depending on industry and role. Compliance is monitored by the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development, with guidance provided on calculation methods, required documentation, and enforcement procedures.Under the first decision, Saudization in engineering professions will rise to 30 percent. This change targets companies with five or more employees working in 46 specialized roles, including:A new minimum wage of SAR 8,000 will apply to Saudi engineers in both private and non-profit sectors. To qualify, professionals must hold accreditation from the Saudi Council of Engineers.The decision took effect on December 31, 2025, but companies will have six months to prepare before full enforcement.This preparation period allows businesses to adjust hiring practices, ensure proper accreditation, and align with Saudization requirements.The ministry has highlighted that the move will not only increase Saudi participation but also improve the work environment by fostering skilled, certified professionals in the sector.The second decision focuses on procurement roles in the private sector, setting a saudization target of 70 percent. This applies to establishments employing three or more workers in 12 key procurement positions, such as:This regulation comes into effect on November 30, 2025, with a six-month grace period to allow companies time to meet the new requirements.The ministry emphasized that increasing Saudi participation in procurement will strengthen national engagement in critical business operations, expand job opportunities for citizens, and enhance overall productivity within the sector.To guide businesses through the transition, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development has published a procedural guide on its website. The guide provides:Companies are urged to follow the guidelines carefully. Failure to meet the new targets may result in penalties, reinforcing the government’s commitment to building a more locally-driven workforce.The ministry described these important measures as part of a strategic step toward boosting employment opportunities for Saudis, improving workplace standards, and strengthening national participation in vital economic sectors.","Saudization, or “Nitaqat,” is a national policy designed to increase the employment of Saudi citizens across public and private sectors.

Practical tips for fasting athletes in 2026



Shift Intense Training to After Sunset or Early Morning - Research shows that timing training around eating and drinking windows optimises performance and recovery during Ramadan. A systematic review in the Journal of Modern Social Sciences found that fasting athletes should adjust training schedules, emphasizing evening sessions after breaking the fast to allow fuel and hydration support before and after exercise. This approach helps maintain both endurance and strength while respecting the fast. Similarly, a World Health Organization–sourced review notes that athletic performance is least affected when tests or training occur after sunset or early in the day, rather than late afternoon during the fast. Prioritise Hydration Between Iftar and Suhoor - Hydration is a critical factor for athletes during extended fasting periods. Although fluid intake is restricted during daylight hours, experts recommend strategic rehydration between sunset (Iftar) and pre-dawn (Suhoor) to prevent dehydration and support performance. Sports nutrition discussions emphasise sipping water in smaller, frequent amounts and including electrolytes (sodium, potassium, magnesium) to replace sweat losses and maintain fluid balance. According to precision hydration specialists, proper hydration after breaking the fast not only supports training and performance but also aids muscle recovery, cardiovascular function and temperature regulation, all essential for athletes training hard. Plan Sleep Strategically and Use Naps When Needed - Sleep disruption is a common challenge during Ramadan because pre-dawn meals and late evening activities alter normal sleep patterns. Research shows that planned naps and adjusting sleep schedules can help offset sleep loss and support recovery, especially when night training sessions run late. Medical and nutrition sources warn that reduced or disrupted sleep can impair athletic performance, metabolic function and recovery. Prioritising sleep, including daytime rest when night training or social schedules cut into typical rest, is a key strategy for maintaining performance while fasting. Adjust Training Intensity According to Energy Levels - Scientific evidence indicates that athletes may need to modify training intensity during Ramadan rather than maintain pre-fasting volumes. A review published in PubMed found that maintaining performance depends on appropriate training intensity, timing and recovery and that athletes can sustain competitive levels when food, fluid and sleep are managed well. Sports dietitians and performance experts also recommend tailoring workouts to lighter sessions during fasting hours and higher-intensity sessions after Iftar to match fluctuating energy levels. This helps reduce the risk of fatigue, muscle breakdown and overtraining while fasting.

Bottom line: Fasting and performance can coexist

Are you a Muslim athlete training in Ramadan this February 2026 and wondering how will you compete while fasting from sunrise until sunset for 30 days? Whether it is world-class fighters, runners or team sport athletes, the art of performing while fasting is not only about their belief but strategy, timing and the science of doing things the right way.This balancing act has become an essential topic in sports science and new research is finally throwing light on the best ways to proceed when training hard on an empty stomach.One of the major points to be noticed about fasting athletes is related to the implications of fasting with respect to food and water intake. A systematic review published in the Journal of Modern Social Sciences in 2025 suggested that while Ramadan fasting alters hydration and energy availability, its impact on anaerobic and aerobic performance is generally limited if athletes manage training, sleep and nutrition properly. The study concluded, “effects on endurance and strength may be improved with proper training and nutrition management” and emphasizes maintaining consistent training during Ramadan as part of an effective strategy.This corresponds with sports nutrition studies, which have found that intermittent fasting such as the Ramadan diet, can enable the body to adapt in a manner where it utilises fat within its system with the help of spared carbohydrates.Based on research, fasting does not necessarily lead to reduced sports performance. Training sessions that take place after breaking the fast, that is, after iftar, show better results compared to training sessions conducted while fasting. This may be because water and nutrient consumption before and after training are essential for muscle and endurance recovery.Such an approach is supported by athletes and coaches alike. In Dubai, martial art competitors such as Bashayer Al Matrooshi and the national jiu-jitsu team of the UAE modify their schedules by training only after the iftar session, so that they refuel and hydrate before physically training.In many sports, the best athletes divide their trainings too with easy skill or activation exercises in the morning and strength or cardio trainings after sunset, when they can eat and drink normally.Contrary to common belief, several scientific investigations have found only modest performance drops or none at all when fasting athletes train smart. According to a 2007 study published in the Journal of Sports Science and Medicine , anaerobic performance and recovery were not significantly impaired by Ramadan fasting in elite athletes, provided hydration and rest were optimised.Another 2012 meta-analysis in Nutrients indicates that while fasting may reduce muscle glycogen and blood glucose, which can affect perceived exertion, anaerobic power and endurance can remain stable with proper timing of meals and training. Research on swimmers and young athletes also suggests that performance differences are often minimal or balanced by shifts in training intensity and recovery periods.Taken together, these findings show that performance loss is not inevitable but training adaptation, hydration planning and sleep timing are the real deciding factors.Fasting athletes are also susceptible to dehydration, in addition to food shortages. Since water is not taken for an entire day, it ends up becoming a big limiting factor, especially when training takes place in hotter environments. Two factors that have been widely observed to contribute to decreased performances in training in terms of balance, reaction time and energy levels include disturbed sleep and fluid restrictions.This explains why many pros pay much attention to post-sunset hydration strategies, as some training programs are designed around the time slots for iftar and suhoor (pre-dawn meals), which are essentially the slots for hydration replenishment before the onset of the new day's fast. Many teams now embrace the programs of hydration tracking, electrolyte replenishment and specific sleep timing to preserve performance while still observing the fast.Across different sports, Muslim athletes have found creative solutions where many schedule intense strength and conditioning sessions after sunset, when food and water are allowed. Fighters and combat athletes often train late at night to maximise recovery and energy availability. Some endurance athletes adjust by tapering mileage during fasting hours and increasing intensity only in the evening.Even elite performers, including NBA star Hakeem Olajuwon and professional footballers, have revealed publicly how Ramadan fasting didn't stop them from competing instead, in some cases, even sharpened their focus, discipline and mental resilience. Runners like Sifan Hassan and rowers like Mohamed Sbihi shift workouts to the non-fasting windows of the day. Top athletes conquer Ramadan fasting by prioritising recovery, nutrient timing and lower-intensity training sessions to maintain performance without health risk.Based on expert advice and scientific evidence, athletes can navigate Ramadan with minimal performance loss by:Fasting during Ramadan is not an antidote to athletic performance. However, there is an appropriate strategy that, if followed, will allow athletes to exert at an elite level, even when they are observing the fast. There are many discoveries being made in this field, which reveal the key fact that it is not the fast but the manner in which athletes respond to it, that impacts performance.",Ramadan does change the physiology but not always in negative ways. Experts recommend strategic rehydration between sunset (Iftar) and pre-dawn (Suhoor) Hydration is a critical factor for athletes during extended fasting periods.

No Hajj visa, no pilgrimage: Egypt sets mandatory health and registration conditions

No Hajj Visa Without It: Egypt Introduces Mandatory Health Rule for 2026 Pilgrims

Bottom line





Ahead of the 1447 AH/2026 Hajj season, the Egyptian government has announced that it will stop providing state-funded free pilgrimage slots. Instead, it will use electronic lottery systems and licensed paid pilgrimage packages. This is a significant change for millions of potential pilgrims and indicates reforms in Egypt’s public spending and Hajj logistics before the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia ’s upcoming Hajj season.Egypt’s Ministry of Social Solidarity and the National Foundation for Facilitating Hajj announced the results of the public electronic Hajj lottery for 2026 pilgrims, selecting approximately 12,000 applicants from across Egyptian governorates through a fully digital draw aimed at promoting transparency. Successful applicants must now pay for their pilgrimage arrangements through official channels.The confirmation of the lottery result was done through a press conference by Minister Maya Morsi. This highlights the fact that the lottery has currently become the main means for Egyptians, as opposed to a subsidized state sponsorship, for Egyptian Hajj visas.This is part of a bigger trend that has been underway for the past few years.During economic strains in 2022 and 2023, Egypt cancelled Hajj at state expense for the second consecutive year, opting not to use government resources to underwrite pilgrimages amid budgetary pressures.Separately, the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities opened Hajj registration via licensed tourism companies for the 2026 season, with applications accepted from mid-October and results published in early November. These packages are presented in economy, mid-range and premier options. They are fully paid pilgrim services, requiring applicants to cover costs ranging from accommodation to transport, managed through officially accredited tour operators.Government data showed that tourism Hajj packages this year were priced across categories to accommodate different budgets and that the ministry even reduced some prices slightly compared to the previous season to ease financial burdens. Here's what this means for Egyptian pilgrims -In addition to changes in government support and lottery systems for the Hajj 2026, Egyptian authorities have made it clear that Muslims going for Hajj must submit certain requirements regarding visas and health documents. The Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities has confirmed that pilgrims are required to present a “Health Fitness Certificate” before they can be given a Hajj visa. The health certificate is a medical document that verifies the pilgrims’ ability to carry out the Hajj rituals.All other official registration formalities have been conducted through the designated channels. The move is a part of the general procedural updates being undertaken to ensure that this is done in an orderly manner and in line with the rules established by the Saudi government, relating to visas as well as safety regulations among the crowds attendant at the annual pilgrimage. Notably, the process of visa application for tourism category Hajj pilgrims is put on hold until this certificate is submitted.Hajj is one of Islam’s five pillars and essential for Muslims who can afford it but rising costs and economic reforms have made traditional free or subsidised government sponsorships less viable. Egypt’s updated model meets the rising demand and Saudi Arabia ’s logistical changes for managing the annual pilgrimage. It prioritises transparency, fairness and controlled access through digital lotteries and regulated tourism channels.For potential pilgrims and their families, the message is clear. Hajj in 2026 will rely on paid, structured packages and lottery allocations instead of blanket government sponsorship. This approach sets a new standard for one of the largest religious migrations on Earth.","Egypt is relying heavily on a digital lottery system where names are selected at random from millions of applicants.

US Shooting Probe | ‘He Killed Himself By...': BIG Reveal After Brown University Shooter Found Dead

Planning, intent, and lack of remorse

“I don’t give a damn about how you judge me or what you think of me,” he said in one recording.

“I’m not going to apologize because during my lifetime no one sincerely apologized to me.”

“To say that I was extraordinarily satisfied, no, but also I don’t regret what I did,”

Views on responsibility, injury, and mental state

“Actually, I think that coming here, both times I did, was a f****g mistake. But to say that you all are extraordinarily bad, that would be neither bad nor good.”

“Honestly, my only regret is this thing in the eye,” he said, laughing. “But it was really hard, man.”

“I already know that you are going to say that I am mentally ill, or some shit like that,” he said. “That is all nonsense.”

“I am sane… I am sane, and… I’ve always been, more or less.”

“In my take on all of this,” he said, pausing repeatedly, “I think the world cannot be redeemed. To sum it all up, that is it.”





Federal assessment





Federal authorities say the man who killed two Brown University students and an MIT professor planned the attacks for at least six semesters and later recorded a series of videos in which he expressed no remorse, rejected apologies, and described the shootings as deliberate. The US Department of Justice released transcripts of the recordings on Tuesday, days after formally confirming the shooter’s death.The shooter, identified by law enforcement as Claudio Neves Valente, was a 48-year-old Portuguese national and former Brown University student. On 13 December, he opened fire inside an engineering building at Brown University, killing two students, Ella Cook and MukhammadAziz Umurzokov, and wounding nine others.Two days later, on 15 December, Valente fatally shot Nuno F.G. Loureiro at his home in Brookline, Massachusetts. Loureiro was an MIT professor and had attended school in Portugal decades earlier with Valente.On Thursday, 18 December 2025, the US Attorneys’ Offices, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives jointly announced Valente’s death. He was found dead inside a storage facility in Salem, New Hampshire.During a federal search of the storage unit, investigators recovered an electronic device containing several short videos Valente recorded after the shootings.In a statement released by the US Department of Justice, officials said the FBI recovered the device while executing a federal search warrant on 18 December. The videos were recorded in Portuguese and later translated into English.“In these videos, Neves Valente admitted that he had been planning the Brown University shooting for a long time,” the department said, adding that he did not provide a motive for targeting either the Brown students or the MIT professor.In the recordings, Valente said he had been planning the attack for more than six semesters and claimed he had numerous chances to carry it out earlier, but did not. In one video, he said he had “plenty of opportunities” but “always chickened out”.Across more than 11 minutes of footage, Valente spoke about the shootings, addressed how he was portrayed in the media, complained about a self-inflicted eye injury, and repeatedly rejected the idea that he owed anyone an apology.In another, he said:He framed his actions as intentional and final. He said his goal was to “leave on his own terms” and made clear he felt no regret for the killings themselves. In a DOJ statement, Valente was described as having “showed no remorse during the recordings”.the transcript reads.Valente also spoke at length about how he expected his actions to be interpreted. He dismissed claims that he was motivated by hatred of the United States, saying instead that the shootings were about opportunity rather than ideology.“When I say that I have no hatred toward America, I also have no love for it,” he said, before adding:He complained repeatedly about a serious eye injury he said he sustained during the attack on the MIT professor, describing it as the only thing he regretted.Valente rejected the suggestion that mental illness explained his actions.He insisted:Near the end of one recording, as the lights in the storage facility began to dim, Valente reflected on his worldview.The DOJ said Valente showed no remorse in the recordings and instead blamed others while complaining about his injuries.“He exposed his true nature when he blamed innocent, unarmed children for their deaths at his hand and grumbled about a self-inflicted injury,” the department said.Officials said the investigation into motive remains ongoing, but added that based on the evidence reviewed so far, authorities do not believe there is any immediate continuing public safety threat linked to the shootings. Additional updates will be provided promptly as more information is developed and after appropriate victim family notifications.","US Department of Justice released transcripts of the recordings on Tuesday.

Bottom line







The United Arab Emirates has swiftly moved into the New Year 2026 with several improvements to its visa and immigration systems where some modifications are indicative of the country’s growing vision to become the international destination for tourism, trade, innovation and living. From visa systems that are suited for the developing sectors to tighter sponsorship laws as well as easy visa issuance for tourists from target countries, many individuals are now wondering what the visa requirements are for the United Arab Emirates in 2026.Nearly a week into the New Year 2026 and the UAE seems to be in no mood to pause its pace. There are reports emerging about the UAE being on the verge of initiating two-year multiple-entry visas for work missions (Mission Visas), thereby ensuring flexibility for professionals.However, other regional initiatives, such as the Gulf Cooperation Council’s Unified Tourist Visa, which is still expected to roll out in 2026, may eventually enable visitors to move through all the GCC countries, including the UAE, using a single visa.At the forefront of the changes brought out in 2025 and now fully in effect in early 2026 are four brand-new visit visa categories designed to bring skilled specialists, creators, cultural participants and maritime tourists to the UAE. According to official updates, these include:This diversification goes well beyond traditional tourism, positioning the UAE as a destination not just for leisure travellers but for professionals in cutting-edge fields, creative talent and global event contributors.Another major shift that took effect in 2025 and continues into 2026 is the income-based sponsorship rule for residents who invite family and friends on visit visas. Instead of the prior, less-defined sponsorship requirements, UAE residents now need to meet specific monthly salary thresholds depending on the relationship:According to the authorities, this will go a long way towards making the system more transparent and will ensure that the sponsored visitors have adequate local support.In an attempt to build stronger relations with India, one of the largest markets for travel and business to the UAE, the country has expanded its visa-on-arrival services for Indians as of February 2025. Indians who possess valid visas or residence permits from countries such as Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea can now avail themselves of visa-on-arrival services at entry points to the UAE.This works in conjunction with the current eligibility for visas on arrival that had been granted to Indian nationals holding visas or residency in US, UK or other countries in the European Union , making it easier than ever for Indian nationals to enter the UAE on a short visit.The Golden Visa Residency Programme in the UAE, offering residency for 5 or 10 years, continued its steady growth in 2025 and into 2026 with further new occupations being added to attract the best worldwide talents. In addition to the classic investor groups, the visa has included individuals such as nurses with extensive seniority in their roles, educators and teachers, content creators and bountiful charity donors, particularly in Islamic endowment activities.These Golden Visa extensions continue to add to the UAE’s long-term plan of holding on to talent by providing security and flexibility to professionals and their families. The advantages extend to easier accessibility of property ownership, business setup and education opportunities.In 2025, the UAE introduced the Humanitarian Resident Permits, where the applicant can come from a country in the state of war, crisis or natural catastrophe and be allowed a stay in the UAE for a period not exceeding one year, renewable upon request, without the need for a sponsor. This is a major step in the human aspect in the visa systems and fits the UAE’s status as a world center for relief and stability.Beyond the new visa categories and sponsor requirements, there are other administrative reforms in the UAE that would ensure a smooth process as well as tightened security measures. Perhaps the most notable change, which applicants would need to be aware of is the compulsory submission of the passport's external cover page for all entry permit applications. It has been done in order to ensure better identity verification and greater accuracy when processing.Taken together, these reforms underline the UAE's forward-looking immigration strategy that balances economic growth, global talent attraction, tourism competitiveness and practical ease of movement for millions of visitors and residents every year. Whether you are an AI specialist looking to visit UAE on a visit visa, a family seeking to sponsor your relatives, a digital nomad desiring residency, or a traveller in search of a hassle-free entry from abroad, the United Arab Emirate's visa landscape stands wider, more diversified and more friendly towards opportunities than ever in 2026.","The United Arab Emirates has swiftly moved into the New Year 2026 with several improvements to its visa and immigration systems.

"CIA turncoat Aldrich Ames, who sold US secrets to Soviets, dies in jail at 84",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/cia-turncoat-aldrich-ames-who-sold-us-secrets-to-soviets-dies-in-jail-at-84/articleshow/126404767.cms,"



WASHINGTON: Aldrich Ames, the most murderous turncoat in the history of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), whose betrayal in working for the Soviet Union went undetected for almost a decade, died Monday. He was 84 and had been a federal prisoner, serving life without parole, since 1994.The death was recorded in the federal bureau of prisons inmate database. The son of an alcoholic CIA officer, Ames failed upward through the agency ranks for 17 years until he attained a headquarters post of extraordinary sensitivity.He became the chief of counterintelligence of the CIA’s Soviet division in Sept 1983. He had access to some of the nation’s deepest secrets: in particular, its clandestine liaisons with the Soviets, who worked in secret with US intelligence.As the Cold War was cresting, Ames decided that he would change the course of history by upending a long-running game of nations, the contest of spy versus spy. He saw it as a charade. By his own account, he was fuelled by a toxic cocktail of vodka, arrogance, delusions of grandeur and greed.In April 1985, he took his first gamble. He hand-delivered an envelope addressed to the KGB chief at the Soviet Embassy in Washington.He offered a smattering of CIA secrets, and he requested $50,000 in return. Ames feared that one of the CIA’s Russians might betray him, so he decided to betray them all. He knew he would be paid a fortune.“I panicked,” he said in a 1994 interview with the New York Times, conducted from jail. “Only by suddenly giving them everyone” would he be protected — and he knew in return that he would be paid “as much money as I could ever use, if I chose to do that.”Ames put together hundreds of secret documents in a 6-pound stack — a who’s who of Soviets working for the CIA and an encyclopedia of US intelligence operations behind the Iron Curtain. He stuffed them in his briefcase, walked out of headquarters and delivered them to a contact at the Soviet Embassy. “I was delivering myself along with them,” he said in the interview. The KGB took care of him — he was paid $2.7 million — and it took care of its own turncoats.As many as 10 Soviet and Soviet-bloc spies were arrested, interrogated and executed for treason. The network that had provided the US with political, military, diplomatic and intelligence insights on Moscow was destroyed. Ames also revealed the identities of two dozen other US intelligence officers and foreign agents working for the CIA and exposed some 50 secret operations in Russia, Europe and Latin America, the agency concluded. As the CIA’s Russians disappeared, one by one by one, the agency began to fear that it had a traitor in its midst. But the search for the mole sputtered and ground to a halt.In 1989, a CIA officer reported that Ames, on returning to Washington, was inexplicably wealthy: He had paid $540,000 in cash for a new home and he was driving a new Jaguar. It was not until 1993 that a probe began, spurred in large part by the FBI. The FBI put handcuffs on Ames in 1994. His wife, who went by Rosario, was arrested too — she knew about his treason and spent the proceeds — and received a five-year jail term.","Aldrich Ames, the most murderous turncoat in the history of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), whose betrayal in working for the Soviet Union went undetected for almost a decade, died Monday.

He said the legislation has been in the works for months with Senator Richard Blumenthal and other lawmakers and could come up for a vote as early as next week.“After a very productive meeting today with President Trump on a variety of issues, he greenlit the bipartisan Russia sanctions bill that I have been working on for months with Senator Blumenthal and many others,” Graham wrote.He said the timing of the bill was important, arguing that Ukraine was making concessions toward peace while Russia continued its military campaign. “This will be well-timed, as Ukraine is making concessions for peace, and Putin is all talk, continuing to kill the innocent,” he said.According to Graham, the bill would allow the US president to penalise countries purchasing discounted Russian oil, which he said was helping finance Moscow’s war effort.“This bill will allow President Trump to punish those countries who buy cheap Russian oil fueling Putin’s war machine,” he wrote.He added that the proposed sanctions would give Trump leverage over major buyers of Russian oil. “This bill would give President Trump tremendous leverage against countries like China, India and Brazil to incentivise them to stop buying the cheap Russian oil that provides the financing for Putin’s bloodbath against Ukraine,” Graham said.Graham said he expected strong bipartisan backing for the legislation and expressed hope that it could be taken up by the Senate as early as next week.",US Senator Lindsey Graham said President Donald Trump has approved a bipartisan Russia sanctions bill.

Buy Greenland? Take It? Why? An old pact already gives Trump a free hand,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/buy-greenland-take-it-why-an-old-pact-already-gives-trump-a-free-hand/articleshow/126404718.cms,"President Trump's desire to acquire Greenland for national security is complicated. A 1951 defense pact already grants the US extensive military access and base-building rights. Despite this, Trump's talk of buying the island faces strong opposition from Greenlanders and Denmark, who emphasize self-determination and the island's inalienable status.

Greenland Revolt: Sen. Kennedy Breaks Ranks With Trump, Delivers Shock Speech On Potential Invasion





President Donald Trump has ridiculed Denmark's dog sled teams in Greenland.He has cited mysterious Chinese and Russian ships prowling off the coast.He seems increasingly fixated on the idea that the United States should take over this gigantic icebound island, with one official saying the president wants to buy it and another suggesting that the United States could simply take it. Just a few days ago, Trump said: ""We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security.""But the question is: Does the United States even need to buy Greenland -- or do something more drastic -- to accomplish all of Trump's goals?Under a little-known Cold War agreement, the United States already enjoys sweeping military access in Greenland. The United States has one base in a very remote corner of the island. But the agreement allows it to ""construct, install, maintain and operate"" military bases across Greenland, ""house personnel"" and ""control landings, takeoffs, anchorages, moorings, movements, and operation of ships, aircraft and waterborne craft. ""It was signed in 1951 by the United States and Denmark, which colonized Greenland more than 300 years ago and still controls some of its affairs.""The US has such a free hand in Greenland that it can pretty much do what it wants,"" said Mikkel Runge Olesen, a researcher at the Danish Institute for International Studies in Copenhagen.""I have a very hard time seeing that the US couldn't get pretty much everything it wanted,"" he said, adding, ""if it just asked nicely.""But buying Greenland -- something Secretary of State Marco Rubio told lawmakers Tuesday was Trump's latest plan -- is a different question.Greenland does not want to be bought by anyone -- especially not the United States. And Denmark does not have the authority to sell it, Olesen said.""It is impossible,"" he said.In the past, Denmark would have been the decider. In 1946, it refused the Truman administration's offer of $100 million in gold.Today, things are different. Greenlanders now have the right to hold a referendum on independence, and Danish officials have said it's up to the island's 57,000 inhabitants to decide their future. A poll last year found 85% of residents opposed the idea of a US takeover.Greenland's prime minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, has repeatedly scoffed at the idea of being bought, saying this past week, ""Our country is not for sale.""The relatively short, straightforward defense agreement between the United States and Denmark was updated in 2004 to include Greenland's semiautonomous government, giving it a say in how US military operations might affect the local population. The roots of the agreement go back to a partnership forged during World War II.(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)At that time, Denmark was occupied by the Nazis. Its ambassador in Washington, cut off from Copenhagen, took it upon himself to strike a defense agreement for Greenland with the United States. (The island is part of North America, along the Arctic Ocean and close to Canada's coast.)The fear was that Nazis could use Greenland as a steppingstone to the US The Germans had already established small meteorological bases on the island's east coast and relayed information for battles in Europe. US troops eventually ousted them and established more than a dozen bases there with thousands of troops, landing strips and other military facilities.After World War II, the United States continued to run some bases and a string of early warning radar sites. As the Cold War wound down, the United States closed all of them except one. It's now called the Pittufik Space Base and helps track missiles crossing the North Pole.The Danes have a light presence, too: a few hundred troops, including special forces that use dog sleds to conduct long-range patrols. In recent months, the Danish government has vowed to upgrade its bases and increase surveillance.(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)After US special forces captured Nicolás Maduro, the president of Venezuela, from a safe house last week, Trump seemed emboldened. Stephen Miller, a top aide, then claimed that Greenland should belong to the United States and that ""nobody's going to fight the United States"" over it. Danish and Greenlandic anxiety skyrocketed.On Tuesday night, Danish and Greenlandic leaders asked to meet with Rubio, according to Greenland's foreign minister. It's not clear if or when that might happen.Tensions between Trump and Denmark's prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, have been steadily rising, as Trump pushes to ""get"" Greenland, as he puts it, while Frederiksen refuses to kowtow to him.Just a few days ago, Frederiksen cited the 1951 agreement, saying, ""We already have a defense agreement between the kingdom and the United States today, which gives the United States wide access to Greenland."" She urged the United States ""to stop the threats"" and said a US attack on Greenland would mean the end of the international world order.European leaders issued their own statement Tuesday, also citing the 1951 agreement and saying, ""Greenland belongs to its people.""Analysts said that if the United States tried to use the defense pact as a fig leaf to send in a lot of troops and try to occupy Greenland, that wouldn't be legal either.According to the 2004 amendment, the United States is supposed to consult with Denmark and Greenland before it makes ""any significant changes"" in its military operations on the island. The 2004 amendment, which was signed by Gen. Colin Powell, who was then the secretary of state, explicitly recognizes Greenland as ""an equal part of the kingdom of Denmark.""Peter Ernstved Rasmussen, a Danish defense analyst, said that in practice, if US forces made reasonable requests, ""the US would always get a yes.""""It is a courtesy formula,"" he said. ""If the US wanted to act without asking, it could simply inform Denmark that it is building a base, an airfield or a port.""That's what infuriates longtime Danish political experts. If Trump wanted to beef up Greenland's security right now, he could. But there has been no such official US request, said Jens Adser Sorensen, a former senior official in Denmark's parliament.""Why don't you use the mechanism of the defense agreement if you're so worried about the security situation?"" he said, adding, ""The framework is there. It's in place.""But Greenland's strategic location is not the only thing that has attracted Trump's inner circle. The enormous island has another draw: critical minerals, loads of them, buried under the ice. Here, too, analysts say, the United States doesn't need to take over the island to get them.Greenlanders have said they are open to doing business -- with just about anyone.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.","A 1951 defense pact already grants the US extensive military access and base- building rights.

US President Donald Trump said the United States should set its military budget for 2027 at $1.5 trillion instead of $1 trillion, arguing that the higher allocation is necessary to build what he called a “Dream Military” capable of deterring any adversary and keeping the country safe.Trump made the announcement in a post on Truth Social, saying the decision followed discussions with lawmakers and senior officials. He said the expanded budget would strengthen national security at a time he described as “very troubled and dangerous”.“After long and difficult negotiations with Senators, Congressmen, Secretaries, and other Political Representatives, I have determined that, for the Good of our Country, especially in these very troubled and dangerous times, our Military Budget for the year 2027 should not be $1 Trillion Dollars, but rather $1.5 Trillion Dollars,” Trump wrote.He said the increased spending would allow the US to build a military force that would keep the country “SAFE and SECURE, regardless of foe”.Trump also linked the proposed increase to revenues generated from tariffs, claiming they had created financial room for higher defence spending. “If it weren’t for the tremendous numbers being produced by Tariffs from other Countries, many of which, in the past, have ‘ripped off’ the United States at levels never seen before, I would stay at the $1 Trillion Dollar number,” he said.MAGA chief added that tariff income now made it possible to fund a larger military while also reducing debt and providing financial benefits to Americans. He contrasted the situation with the previous administration, saying the revenues being generated were “unthinkable in the past”.","US President Donald Trump said the United States should set its military budget for 2027 at $1.5 trillion instead of $1 trillion.

Months of waiting with 221(g) slip not unusual: Immigration attorney explains H-1B stamping delay,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/months-of-waiting-with-221g-slip-not-unusual-immigration-attorney-explains-h-1b-stamping-delay/articleshow/126402104.cms,"U.S. Rewrites H-1B Rules, Setback To Indian Workers; Check Who Is Eligible & Changes | WATCH

What is 221(g) delay?

Checklist to avoid 221(g) delay

Gather every document possible, including H-1B approval notice (I-797), job offer or verification letter from your employer, pay stubs, tax returns, and the complete petition paperwork.

Be prepared to answer questions about your job duties, your employer, the work location. Before the interview, review what was stated in the H-1B petition and the DS-160 form.

No field should be left blank in the form.

The employer should be alerted that they may have to respond to the consulate's inquiries.





Immigration attorney Steven Brown said getting a 221(g)notice after the consular interview has become a new normal for H-1b professionals who are now stuck in their home countries without knowing when their application will come out of ""administrative processing"" and when they can come back to their job in the US. The attorney explained that this 221(g) slip does not mean a refusal; it means the State Department is saying: 'We are not done with your case yet.""After the department started social media vetting since December 15, 2025, almost all applicants in India said they were given the 221(g) slip and their applications were approved in a day or two. Visa officers are not making spot decisions of H-1B stamping before going through the social media history of the applicants and hence everyone is getting the 221(g) slip.But if the delay turns from days to weeks and then to months, H-1B applicants can follow up with the consular office. While the applicants can also go to the court when the delay becomes unreasonable and remains unexplained. Bfrown said a lawsuit does not provide any guarantee of approval and a lawsuit also takes time to progress.Apart from the present social media vetting delay, the consulate may issue a 221(g) slip seeking additional documents or information from the applicant or the employer. If no additional info is requested, the notice typically states that your case is pending further administrative processing.","Gather every document possible, including H-1B approval notice (I-797), job offer or verification letter from your employer, pay stubs, tax returns, and the complete petition paperwork.

A woman was shot dead during a confrontation involving federal immigration agents (ICE) in south Minneapolis on Wednesday, with a witness disputing the Trump administration's claim that the shooting was an act of self-defence and the woman was trying to run over officers.Emily Heller told MPR News that shouting outside her home woke her up, and she saw a tense scene on the road. She said a car was blocking traffic and appeared to be part of a protest against federal law enforcement activity in Minnesota. She lives near 33rd Street and Portland Avenue, where the incident took place.Heller said ICE agents were shouting at a woman driver, telling her to “get out of here”. According to Heller, the woman was attempting to turn her car around to leave when an agent stepped directly in front of the vehicle and shot her in the face.“She was trying to turn around, and the ICE agent was in front of her car, and he pulled out a gun and put it right in — like, his midriff was on her bumper — and he reached across the hood of the car and shot her in the face like three, four times,” Heller told MPR.Heller said the car then accelerated and crashed into a utility pole and other parked vehicles nearby. The driver was seen slumped over the steering wheel, with blood visible inside the car in social media videos.Federal authorities gave a different account and perspective of the incident. In a statement, ICE said the agent fired after “fearing for his life” during a ""violent"" confrontation with the woman, and acted in self-defence.“Today, ICE officers in Minneapolis were conducting targeted operations when rioters began blocking ICE officers and one of these violent rioters weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them,” the statement said.“An ICE officer, fearing for his life, the lives of his fellow law enforcement and the safety of the public, fired defensive shots,” it added.ICE said the woman was killed and that the injured officers were expected to recover.The shooting came a day after the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced its largest-ever operation was underway in Minnesota. The agency said 2,000 officers were being deployed to the Twin Cities as part of the huge immigration crackdown. The GOP government has shown its hostility towards the large Somali community living in the Blue states, with leaders like Elon Musk and JD Vance calling for their deportations. Moreover, a recent, alleged scam, fraud came to light, which is also under investigation.Social media users claimed the woman was a legal observer. Viral videos appear to show a doctor being prevented at gunpoint from giving medical aid before emergency services arrived.City officials are expected to address the incident later on Wednesday.",A woman was shot dead during a confrontation involving federal immigration agents (ICE) in south Minneapolis on Wednesday.

Health secretary RFK Jr Wedenesday announced new dietary guidelines for Americans, calling a war on staple processed food and sugary drinks. The guideline also introduced a new inverted pyramid with meats and vegetables at the top occupying the widest part while grains come at the bottom. “We are ending the war on saturated fats,” Kennedy stated, urging Americans to “Eat real food.”“The new framework centers on protein and healthy fats, vegetables, fruits and whole grains. It’s upside down, a lot of people say. It was actually upside down before,” Kennedy said.“Avoid highly processed packaged, prepared, ready-to-eat, or other foods that are salty or sweet, such as chips, cookies, and candy that have added sugars and sodium (salt),” the guidelines said calling out certain highly processed foods for the first time. “Instead, prioritize nutrient-dense foods and home-prepared meals. When dining out, choose nutrient-dense options.”The dietary guidelines ended the protein debate and recommended 1.2 to 1.6 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. The previously recommended amount was 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. The guidelines recommend 3 servings of vegetables per day and 2 servings of fruits per day.Whole grains are also encouraged, and 2-4 servings are recommended per day.Previous federal guidelines recommended limiting added sugars to less than 10% of daily calories. That's about 12 teaspoons a day in a 2,000-calorie daily diet. The new guideline says no amount of sugar should be considered part of a healthy diet.The previous recommendation was to limit alcohol to one dronk or less per day for women and two drinks or less per day for men.

Can the owners be deported?





A row erupted after a MAGA influencer called for the deportation of Indian American hotel owners who refused to provide rooms to immigration enforcement officers, and that even US citizenship should not protect them.Conservative commentator Andrew Branca weighed in on the incident on X after reports emerged that a Hampton Inn by Hilton in Minnesota cancelled reservations made by officials from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).“These four Indian-American owners of the Hampton Inn in Minneapolis who canceled the reservations for DHS simply because DHS was enforcing immigration law, look, if they're here on visas, obviously deport them,” Branca said.He added that they should be stripped of their privilege: “But even if they're naturalized citizens, they should be denaturalized and then deported.”He added that America is no place for those who act against its interests: “When we grant the precious gift of American citizenship to a foreign national, it's with the understanding that they're going to act in the interests of the United States, not contrary to those interests.”An X user confronted Branca and said the owners are just practising their rights according to US Constitution: ""So deport them because they exercise their first amendment rights? Do you know how insane you sound?""To this argument, Branca replied with 8 words: ""Deport them because they are not cultural Americans.""Public records show the Hampton Inn by Hilton in Lakeville, Minnesota, was purchased last year for $15 million by four Indian American partners through a limited liability company (LLC). The owners are listed as Parmjit Singh, Amanpreet Hundal, Karandeep Nagra and Mohinderjeet Kaur.The controversy began after emails went viral on social media showing hotel staff informing colleagues that reservations made by DHS and ICE must be rejected. One email stated, “We have noticed an influx of GOV reservations made today that have been for DHS, and we are not allowing any ICE or immigration agents to stay at our property.”Hilton confirmed the hotel is independently owned and said the incident does not reflect the company’s values.Under US law, only non-citizens can be deported. That means people in the country on a visa or with a green card can be removed if they violate immigration rules or certain laws. Green card holders may face deportation for crimes, immigration fraud, abandoning residency or other serious issues. A naturalised US citizen generally cannot be deported, unless the government first proves their citizenship was obtained unlawfully and a court revokes it through a formal denaturalisation process.In the case of Hampton Hotels, refusing rooms to federal agents is not a crime under US law.

Greenland crisis puts Nato’s red lines to the test

What will happen to Nato if US took Greenland?





US secretary of state Marco Rubio on Wednesday announced that he will be meeting officials in Denmark next week.""I'll be meeting with them next week,"" Rubio told news agency APThe demand for Greenland is not a hidden fact. Earlier, the Danish PM said that if the United States decided to attack another Nato country, which is Greenland, then everything would stop, including Nato.Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen on Monday said that the Greenland takeover means the end of the Nato military alliance, DW reported.Frederiksen said that ""everything would stop"" when it comes to cooperation with Washington in the event of a US attack on another Nato member.""If the United States decides to attack another Nato country, then everything would stop — that includes Nato and therefore post-World War II security,"" Frederiksen said.Trump, from the very beginning, has made its clear about his intentions. Trump’s long-standing scepticism of Nato — from scolding “delinquent” allies to questioning whether America should defend Europe at all — has already rattled capitals across the continent. A recent summit papered over the cracks with higher defence pledges and flattery, but the fissures never really closed.During the 2024 election campaign, Donald Trump said he would not protect “delinquent” Nato members that did not meet the then target of spending 2% of GDP on defence.His defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, emphasised in February that the US was no longer “primarily focused” on defending Europe, as per the Guardian.The comments provoked alarm in Europe, but diplomacy ahead of June’s Nato summit appeared to have eased the problem. Nato allies, except Spain, agreed to lift defence spending to 3.5% of GDP by 2035, following comments by secretary general Mark Rutte, who called the US president “daddy”.While it seems that Trump has no interest in Nato, voila! new thing happened. In a post on Truth Social on Wednesday, Trump said that the US will always be there for Nato, even if they won’t be there for the country.""Remember, for all of those big Nato fans, they were at 2% GDP, and most weren’t paying their bills, UNTIL I CAME ALONG. The USA was, foolishly, paying for them! I, respectfully, got them to 5% GDP, AND THEY PAY, immediately. Everyone said that couldn’t be done, but it could, because, beyond all else, they are all my friends. Without my involvement, Russia would have ALL OF UKRAINE right now. Remember, also, I single-handedly ENDED 8 WARS, and Norway, a Nato Member, foolishly chose not to give me the Noble Peace Prize. But that doesn’t matter! What does matter is that I saved Millions of Lives,"" he said in a post.Europe’s postwar security order faces a potential breaking point if the United States moves to annex Greenland in 2026. European leaders increasingly believe the Trump White House is seriously considering such a step, framing it as a matter of Arctic security while quietly exploring diplomatic, legal and economic pathways to assert control. For Europe, the stakes go far beyond Greenland’s 57,000 residents: a US annexation of Nato territory would shatter the assumption that Washington remains a reliable ally rather than a predatory power. Yet Europe’s response options are painfully limited. The continent is still deeply dependent on US military capabilities, intelligence and nuclear deterrence, and its rearmament drive will take years to mature. That dependence has already been exploited, most notably when Europe accepted punitive trade tariffs to avoid provoking a US withdrawal from Ukraine and Nato. Greenland now looks like a replay of the same coercive playbook, Times magazine reported.US officials argue Denmark cannot adequately secure the Arctic against Russia and China, but European leaders counter that existing Nato frameworks already give Washington extensive military access. This fuels suspicion that the real objective is territorial expansion rather than security.Nato’s membership might not change even if the US took Greenland, as the treaty had no clear provision for expelling a country. Its preamble committed the US and other allies “to live in peace with all peoples and all governments” and “to safeguard the freedom, common heritage and civilisation of their peoples”, wording once intended for use against a member that became communist during the Cold War.One alliance member turning on another, even over an Arctic territory with a population of less than 60,000, would undermine the credibility of the 76-year-old military alliance intended to ensure peace and mutual protection across Europe and the North Atlantic.Marion Messmer, a director at the Chatham House thinktank, said the latest threats had already caused damage at a time when the Russian menace felt more real, even as Moscow remained heavily embroiled in Ukraine. “If any European states harbour any illusions they can rely on US security guarantees, then this is the wake-up call we are not returning to that world,” Messmer said.",Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen on Monday said that the Greenland takeover means the end of the Nato military alliance. Trump’s long-standing scepticism of Nato — from scolding “delinquent” allies to questioning whether America should defend Europe at all — has rattled capitals across the continent.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126399798,imgsize-80742,width-400,resizemode-4/ai-image.jpg"

DHAKA: Demonstrating Dhaka’s efforts to get closer to Islamabad, Bangladesh has expressed a “potential interest” in procuring the JF-17 Thunder fighter aircraft from Pakistan, besides resuming direct flights between the two countries from Jan 29, after over a decade.JF-17 — jointly developed by China and Pakistan — was used against India during the May 7-10 hostilities by Pakistan — a combat aircraft, which IAF chief Air Chief Marshal A P Singh in Nov last year said was among the “at least five high-tech Pakistani fighters” shot down during Operation Sindoor.“Detailed discussions were held on the ‘potential procurement’ of JF-17 Thunder aircraft,” the Pakistan military's media wing ISPR said in a statement following a meeting between Bangladesh air force chief Hasan Mahmood Khan and his Pakistani counterpart Zaheer Ahmed Babar Sidhu in Islamabad on Tuesday. “The meeting focused on strengthening operational cooperation and institutional synergy, with emphasis on training, capacity building, and collaboration in aerospace advancements,” ISPR said, an indication of warming relations between Islamabad and.

Pakistan’s Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry on Tuesday said that nearly 71% of terrorist incidents reported in 2025 originated from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP). He attributed this concentration to a “politically conducive environment and the flourishing political-criminal-terror-nexus which is flourishing there”.Data released by the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) reinforces the scale of the surge. KP recorded the sharpest rise in violence, with “fatalities rose from 1,620 in 2024 to 2,331 in 2025” — a year-on-year increase of more than 40%.The broader national picture is even starker. According to the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS), 2025 was the “deadliest” year in a decade, with 3,387 combat-related deaths. These included 2,115 terrorists, 664 security personnel, 580 civilians and 28 members of pro-government peace committees. PICSS said violence intensified in both “tempo and lethality”, pushing multiple security indicators to their highest levels in years.“Militant attacks climbed to their highest annual total since 2014, and the use of suicide bombings and small drones showed a clear upward trend,” the report said.Suicide attacks rose by 53%, while terrorist incidents overall increased to 1,063 — the highest since 2014.Security forces and civilians also bore rising costs. Security personnel fatalities rose 26% to their highest level since 2011, while civilian deaths increased by 24%, marking the worst toll in a decade. Injuries surged by 53% to 2,263, with sharp rises across all categories.The violence has been most acute in KP and Balochistan. In Bannu alone, Deputy Inspector General Sajjad Khan said 27 police personnel were killed in 134 attacks during 2025. Police carried out 168 intelligence-based operations, arresting 105 militants and killing 65, he said.Pakistan frequently accuses Afghanistan’s Taliban authorities of sheltering the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a militant group blamed for a sharp increase in attacks inside Pakistan since 2021. Afghan officials reject the allegations, insisting they do not permit their territory to be used for attacks against other countries.While the TTP operates independently from Afghanistan’s Taliban, the two groups maintain close ties.Relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan have deteriorated since October, when border clashes followed explosions in Kabul on Oct. 9 that Afghan officials attributed to Pakistan. Although Qatar later helped mediate a ceasefire, talks hosted by Turkey in November failed to produce a lasting agreement.","Nearly 71% of terrorist incidents reported in 2025 originated from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

ISLAMABAD: The polio vaccination campaign in Pakistan's merged districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa fell short of its target, leaving over 935,000 children under five unvaccinated, officials said, citing security challenges and population displacement as key hurdles, The Express Tribune reported.According to The Express Tribune, citing authorities, thousands of families from North and South Waziristan, Bajaur, and other merged districts have migrated to different parts of the country, complicating monitoring and vaccination efforts.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Khyber Pakhtunkhwa reported 19 polio cases in 2025, including four each in North Waziristan, Lakki Marwat, and Tank; three in Bannu; two in Torghar; and one each in Dera Ismail Khan and Lower Kohistan, as reported by The Express Tribune.Officials noted that staffing and operational support for WHO and Unicef programmes in the merged districts were reduced last year, while WHO funding cuts also affected campaign coverage, leaving children in these areas at heightened risk.In Sindh, more than 12,000 children under five were reportedly missed during the final polio drive of 2025 in Hyderabad and surrounding areas, according to The Express Tribune.Refusals were recorded mainly in Cantonment areas and municipal towns such as Hussainabad, Preetabad, Qasimabad, and Tando Jam, with absent households and parental refusals cited as primary reasons.Despite these gaps, the nationwide anti-polio campaign successfully vaccinated more than 44.6 million children across Pakistan, according to The Express Tribune.Punjab led with 22.9 million children vaccinated, followed by Sindh with 10.6 million, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with 7.15 million, and Balochistan with 2.58 million.Officials said contributions from other regions also added to the national tally.Authorities warned that without sustained vaccination efforts, particularly in displaced and high-risk populations, children in the merged districts remain vulnerable to polio, The Express Tribune reported.","Polio vaccination campaign in Pakistan's merged districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa fell short of its target.

Open Letter From Pakistan Backs India As Baloch Leader Signals Diplomatic Break With Islamabad





Baloch leader Mir Yar Baloch has raised a “serious threat” warning over deepening China–Pakistan ties, claiming that China could deploy its military forces in Pakistan’s Balochistan region in the coming months.In an open letter to external affairs minister S Jaishankar, posted on X on New Year’s Day, Mir Yar Baloch said Baloch representatives view the growing strategic partnership between Islamabad and Beijing as “dangerous.”He said Balochistan has “faced decades of repression under Pakistan’s control,” including what he described as “state-sponsored violence” and “human rights abuses.”""The people of Balochistan have endured Pakistan's state occupation, state-sponsored terrorism, and egregious human rights atrocities for the past seventy-nine years. The time has now arrived to eradicate this festering affliction at its roots, ensuring lasting peace and sovereignty for our nation, "" he wrote.In his letter to EAM Jaishankar, Mir Yar Baloch said that China and Pakistan are rapidly moving toward the final stages of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a major Belt and Road Initiative project led by Chinese President Xi Jinping that passes through Balochistan.“The Republic of Balochistan views the escalating strategic alliance between Pakistan and China as profoundly dangerous.We warn that China, in collaboration with Pakistan, has advanced the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) to its final phases,” he said.He warned that unless Baloch resistance and defence forces are strengthened, the region could soon see direct Chinese military involvement.“Should the capabilities of Balochistan's defense and freedom forces not be further bolstered and if they continue to be overlooked as per longstanding patterns, it is conceivable that China could deploy its military forces in Balochistan within a few months,” the letter stated.Mir Yar Baloch also said that any Chinese troop deployment without the approval of the local people could have serious consequences for the region.“The presence of Chinese boots on Balochistani soil without the will of the 60 million Baloch people would pose an unimaginable threat and challenge to the futures of both Bharat and Balochistan,” he wrote.China and Pakistan have repeatedly rejected claims that CPEC has a military angle, saying the project is only economic. India, however, has always opposed CPEC, pointing out that it passes through Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir and affects India’s sovereignty and security.Earlier this year in the Rajya Sabha, minister of state for external affairs Kirti Vardhan Singh repeated India’s stance. In a written reply, he said: “Government's position on CPEC is clear and consistent. Government has consistently protested to parties concerned over the inclusion of the so-called 'China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)', which passes through parts of the Indian Union Territories of Ladakh and Jammu & Kashmir under illegal occupation of Pakistan, as a flagship project of 'OBOR/BRI' and asked them to cease these activities. Any proposed participation of third countries or expansion of the so-called CPEC projects to third countries is unacceptable.”Mir Yar Baloch also praised India’s recent counterterror military actions, highlighting Operation Sindoor, which targeted key terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir after the Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 people.“We commend the bold and resolute actions undertaken by the Modi Government in the previous year through Operation Sindoor, particularly targeting terrorism hubs facilitated by Pakistan and directed against the Pakistani military in response to Pahalgam terror attack. These measures demonstrate exemplary courage and a steadfast commitment to regional security and justice,” he wrote.There has been no official response so far from the Union government, or from Chinese or Pakistani authorities, to Mir Yar Baloch’s claims.",Baloch leader Mir Yar Baloch has raised a “serious threat” warning over deepening China–Pakistan ties.

Why the annual exchange matters



Historical context



Limits of the agreement







NEW DELHI: India and Pakistan on Thursday exchanged, through diplomatic channels, the list of nuclear installations and facilities covered under the Agreement on the Prohibition of Attack against Nuclear Installations and Facilities, the ministry of external affairs said.The exchange took place simultaneously in New Delhi and Islamabad, in keeping with the provisions of the bilateral agreement that governs the protection of nuclear infrastructure in both countries.According to the MEA, the agreement requires India and Pakistan to inform each other of the nuclear installations and facilities covered under the pact on 1 January of every calendar year. Thursday’s exchange marked the 35th consecutive exchange of such lists, with the first taking place on 1 January 1992.The annual exchange has continued uninterrupted for over three decades, even during periods of heightened political and military tension between the two neighbours.The Agreement on the Prohibition of Attack against Nuclear Installations and Facilities was signed on 31 December 1988 and entered into force on 27 January 1991, following the exchange of instruments of ratification by both sides.Under the agreement, both India and Pakistan commit themselves to refrain from undertaking, encouraging or participating in any action aimed at causing destruction of, or damage to, nuclear installations or facilities in the other country.The scope of the agreement is broad. Nuclear installations and facilities covered under the pact include nuclear power plants, research reactors, fuel fabrication units, uranium enrichment facilities, isotope separation plants, reprocessing units and sites storing significant quantities of radioactive material, whether fresh or irradiated.The agreement also specifies that both countries must exchange information on the locations of these facilities, typically in the form of latitude and longitude coordinates, once every year.The annual exchange of lists is designed to reduce the risk of accidental, miscalculated or deliberate attacks on sensitive nuclear infrastructure during periods of conflict or crisis.By formally identifying protected sites, the agreement seeks to prevent scenarios in which conventional military operations could inadvertently escalate into a nuclear crisis. An attack on a nuclear installation, even with conventional weapons, could have catastrophic humanitarian, environmental and strategic consequences.Security analysts view the exchange as a confidence-building measure that helps maintain a minimum level of predictability between two nuclear-armed neighbours with a long history of conflict.Notably, the exchange has continued even during times of strained relations, including after major crises such as the Kargil conflict, the 2001–02 military standoff, the 2016 Uri attack and the 2019 Pulwama attack and Balakot air strikes.When the agreement was negotiated in the late 1980s, both India and Pakistan were moving steadily towards overt nuclear capability, though neither had yet conducted nuclear tests. Concerns over pre-emptive strikes on nuclear facilities, particularly in the context of regional instability, were central to the discussions.The agreement was one of the earliest formal nuclear confidence-building measures between the two countries and predated their 1998 nuclear tests, after which both openly declared themselves nuclear weapon states.Since entering into force in 1991, the agreement has remained intact despite the absence of progress on broader nuclear arms control or risk-reduction mechanisms in South Asia.While the pact prohibits attacks on nuclear installations and facilities, it does not restrict the development, deployment or use of nuclear weapons themselves. Nor does it include verification mechanisms beyond the annual exchange of lists.The agreement also does not cover missile bases, command and control centres or other strategic military assets linked to nuclear weapons.Even so, diplomats and experts argue that the continued observance of the agreement reflects a shared recognition of the dangers posed by attacks on nuclear infrastructure.More than three decades after it came into force, the agreement remains one of the few enduring pillars of nuclear risk reduction between India and Pakistan.In an environment marked by limited dialogue and recurring tensions, the uninterrupted annual exchange of nuclear installation lists serves as a reminder that both sides continue to acknowledge the need to prevent catastrophic escalation.For now, the routine exchange remains a rare example of sustained institutional cooperation between the two countries in the nuclear domain.","India and Pakistan exchange list of nuclear installations and facilities covered under the Agreement on the Prohibition of Attack against Nuclear Installations and Facilities.

ISLAMABAD: Traders across Pakistan have threatened a nationwide shutdown on January 16 if the government does not withdraw its decision to make the installation of Point of Sale (POS) machines mandatory, warning that the move would further burden small businesses and open new avenues for harassment by tax officials, as reported by Dawn.According to Dawn, the warning came during a protest rally held in Islamabad, where traders attempted to march from Aabpara Chowk towards the Red Zone to demonstrate against the Federal Board of Revenue's (FBR) directive.However, heavy police deployment stopped the procession near the Serena Hotel, forcing demonstrators to hold a sit-in at the spot.The protest was organised by the All Pakistan Anjuman-i-Tajran in collaboration with the Traders Action Committee and drew participation from shopkeepers and market representatives from Islamabad and Rawalpindi.Leaders of various trader bodies addressed the gathering, accusing the government of targeting small businesses instead of addressing large-scale corruption.Addressing the crowd, Ajmal Baloch, president of the Traders Action Committee in Islamabad, described the compulsory installation of POS machines as a ""black law"" designed to intimidate traders rather than reform the tax system.He claimed that under the guise of documentation, traders would be exposed to greater harassment and bribery demands by tax officials.Citing an International Monetary Fund assessment, Baloch alleged that corruption in Pakistan amounts to nearly PKR 53 trillion annually, with the FBR accounting for a major share.He accused the department of selectively targeting small shopkeepers while ignoring large-scale corruption.He also alleged that many FBR officials own assets beyond their known sources of income and that their families enjoy foreign education and luxurious lifestyles.The protest leaders also highlighted alleged irregularities in customs operations, claiming that consignments of legally imported goods had been seized and partially returned, while the rest allegedly disappeared, as highlighted by Dawn.Warning of tougher action ahead, the traders announced that if the government attempted to forcibly install POS machines or seal shops, they would block a major arterial road in Islamabad and stage a sit-in at Zero Point on January 16.They further threatened a countrywide shutdown strike if their demands were ignored.The protesters appealed to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to intervene and protect traders from what they described as arbitrary and heavy-handed actions by tax authorities, as reported by Dawn.","Traders across Pakistan have threatened a nationwide shutdown on January 16 if the government does not withdraw its decision to make the installation of Point of Sale (POS) machines mandatory.

Pakistan army chief field marshal Asim Munir hosted his daughter’s wedding last week in the garrison city of Rawalpindi, where she was married to her first cousin, Abdul Rehman, according to Pakistani media reports.The ceremony was attended by senior political leaders and top military officials but was kept low-key due to security considerations, with no official photographs released.Among those present at the ceremony were Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari, prime minister Shehbaz Sharif, deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar, Punjab chief minister Maryam Nawaz, the chief of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), and several serving and retired senior army officers, including former army chiefs.Pakistani journalist Zahid Gishkori said around 400 guests attended the event, which was deliberately kept subdued.Gishkori, in a video posted on social media platform YouTube, confirmed the family connection between the bride and groom. “Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir's daughter Mahnoor married his brother's son, ex-army captain turned civil servant Abdul Rehman Qasim,” he said.The groom, Abdul Rehman, is Munir’s nephew. According to local media, he previously served in the Pakistan Army as a captain before joining the civil administration through a quota reserved for army officers.He currently serves as an assistant commissioner.Munir has four daughters, and last week's ceremony marked the wedding of his third daughter.The wedding coincided with the arrival of UAE President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan in Pakistan on the same day, prompting speculation on social media about a possible link between the two events. However, Ghiskori said that the UAE president did not attend the wedding.Pakistan’s security and foreign policy under Munir remains critical. A report by Greek City Times said that global patience with Pakistan’s trajectory toward “religious extremism” was wearing thin, alleging that the country had moved toward a more theocratic posture while failing to curb radical elements at home.Another report by Asian News Post criticised Islamabad’s military-led approach to regional diplomacy, particularly in relation to Afghanistan, stating that the strategy had failed to stabilise borders or improve Pakistan’s international standing.","Munir has four daughters, and last week's ceremony marked the wedding of his third daughter.

Pakistan's former spy chief Faiz Hameed challenged his conviction by a military court which had sentenced him to 14 years in jail, media reports said on Monday.Hameed, the former chief of the powerful Inter-Services Intelligence, was convicted on December 11 by a Field General Court Martial (FGCM) on four counts - engaging in political activities, violating the Official Secrets Act, misusing authority and government resources, and causing wrongful loss to individuals.Hameed's lawyer Mian Ali Ashfaq confirmed that the appeal was filed two days ago, The Express Tribune newspaper reported.A separate application has also been submitted to the Court of Appeal's registrar at General Headquarters Pakistan Army, seeking a copy of the written decision, it said.""The appeal has already been filed,"" Ashfaq said, without disclosing the specific grounds raised in the challenge.Hameed was allowed to appeal against the sentence within 40 days, as given under Section 133-B of the Pakistan Army Act.The appeal will be heard by a Court of Appeals headed by a major general or a senior officer nominated by the army chief, who may uphold, modify or set aside the sentence.Hameed is being held at Special Prison Rawalpindi and has not been shifted to Adiala Jail, the report said.His conviction stems from a 2017 complaint filed by a property developer, who alleged that Hameed, then serving as a major general in the ISI, along with two other officers, raided his residence and business premises, confiscated valuables, and forced him to pay Rs 40 million while also funding a private television channel.The matter resurfaced in 2023 when the Supreme Court directed the property developer to approach the defence ministry, which subsequently instituted a Court of Inquiry in April 2024 to probe the allegations, leading to Hameed's arrest on August 12 that year.The FGCM proceedings commenced on August 12, 2024, and continued for around 15 months before the verdict was announced.Hameed retired from military service in November 2022, became the first former ISI director general to be tried by a military court and convicted.

Pakistan has once again found itself on the defensive after a senior government official publicly acknowledged the impact of India’s precision strikes on a key military installation during the escalation in May, following Operation Sindoor The admission came from Pakistan’s foreign minister and deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, who, during a year-end press briefing on Saturday, confirmed that India had targeted the Nur Khan Air Base in Rawalpindi’s Chaklala area. Dar acknowledged that the strike caused damage to the military installation and injured personnel stationed there.Addressing reporters, Dar said India had launched multiple drone incursions into Pakistani territory within a short span, underlining the scale of the operation. “They (India) send drones towards Pakistan. In 36 hours, at least 80 drones were sent... We were able to intercept 79 drones out of 80, and only one drone damaged a military installation and personnel were also injured in the attack,” he claimed, according to news agency ANI.Also Read: 'Was advised to take shelter in bunker': Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari's big Op Sindoor admission - watch The foreign minister went on to describe the sequence of events following the strikes, saying that Pakistan’s civil and military leadership, led by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, held an emergency meeting on the night of May 9 to respond to the evolving situation.He added that India “made the mistake” of attacking the Nur Khan Air Base in the early hours of May 10, a remark that further acknowledged the strike and its impact.Dar’s comments amount to a rare public admission by a top Pakistani official of India’s military action on Pakistani air bases in May. The strikes came after Operation Sindoor, launched by the Indian Armed Forces to target nine terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir, in retaliation for the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam that killed 26 civilians.The Pakistan Air Force’s Nur Khan Air Base in Chaklala suffered significant damage during the Indian precision strikes. India had launched Operation Sindoor in the early hours of May 7 as a direct response to the Pahalgam attack.The escalation that followed saw increased cross-border shelling by Pakistan and retaliatory action by Indian forces. The situation later took an unexpected turn when Pakistan’s Director General of Military Operations contacted his Indian counterpart to propose a ceasefire, which India accepted. The outreach from the Pakistani side was later confirmed by Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri, who said both sides agreed to halt all military operations on land, at sea and in the air.Satellite imagery released by Maxar Technologies on May 13 showed significant damage to multiple Pakistani air bases, including Nur Khan Air Base. The images revealed damage at four installations: Nur Khan Air Base in Rawalpindi, PAF Base Mushaf in Sargodha, Bholari Air Base and PAF Base Shahbaz in Jacobabad. A comparison of satellite images taken on April 25 and May 10 showed clear damage to air base facilities, corroborating the strikes.This is not the first time a senior Pakistani leader has acknowledged the attack on Nur Khan Air Base. In May, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif admitted that Indian ballistic missiles had hit the base and other locations, breaking from Pakistan’s usual practice of denying Indian military action.Addressing a ceremony at the Pakistan Monument on May 16, Sharif said, “At around 2:30 am on May 10, General Syed Asim Munir called me on a secure line and informed me that India's ballistic missiles had hit Nur Khan Airbase and other areas. Our Air Force used homegrown technology to save our country, and they even used modern gadgets and technology on Chinese jets,” Geo News reported.",Pakistan FM Ishaq Dar Admits India Hit Nur Khan Air Base In Operation Sindoor Strikes.

Operation Sindoor

NEW DELHI: Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari admitted that he was urged to take shelter in a bunker for his safety during the four-day confrontation with India in May, a remark that underscored India’s prowess to strike deep into mainland Pakistan.According to Zardari, the advice came from his military secretary, though he claimed he refused to take shelter.“I had actually told him (secretary) four days earlier that a war was going to happen. But he came to me and said, ‘Sir, let’s go to the bunkers.’ I replied, ‘If martyrdom is to come, it will come here. Leaders don’t die in bunkers; they die on the battlefield. They don’t die sitting in bunkers,’” Zardari said on Saturday at a rally marking the death anniversary of his wife and former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, who was assassinated in 2007.He added that every worker of his Pakistan Peoples Party was ready to sacrifice his life for the nation.Zardari also responded to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “roti khao, varna meri goli toh hai hi” (eat your food peacefully, or else my bullet is waiting for you) warning to Pakistan, saying that it would be Pakistan that would fire the bullets.He further remarked that India may have an economy 10 times larger than Pakistan’s, but questioned where it would find the “courage” to fight a war.Indian armed forces launched Operation Sindoor on the intervening night of May 6–7 in retaliation for the Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 civilians. The strikes targeted nine terror facilities in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.Pakistan responded to the operation, triggering further retaliation by Indian forces, which subsequently struck around a dozen Pakistani air force bases.On May 10, Pakistan’s Director General of Military Operations contacted his Indian counterpart seeking a ceasefire, which was accepted.India has consistently maintained that Operation Sindoor has only been “halted” and would be resumed in the future if required.","Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari admitted that he was urged to take shelter in a bunker for his safety during the four-day confrontation with India in May.

Trump Puts Asim Munir On Gaza Test: Can Pak Army Chief Appease U.S & Avoid Backlash At Home?

Former Imran Khan aide Shahzad Akbar attacked in UK





Pakistan on Friday summoned Britain’s deputy high commissioner Matt Cannell after a video circulated online showing a woman at a rally in the UK referring to a possible attack on Pakistan Army chief General Asim Munir The ministry of foreign affairs called in Cannell to lodge a formal protest and demanded an investigation after the woman, speaking at a rally in Bradford in northern England, mentioned the possibility of the army chief being killed in a car bombing. Pakistani officials said the remarks went beyond political expression and raised serious security concerns.The rally was held in support of Pakistan’s jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan and was attended by his supporters living in the UK. Khan was removed from office through a no-confidence vote in April 2022 and has been in prison for nearly two years.The Bradford protest came days after a special court of Pakistan’s Federal Investigation Agency sentenced Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, to 17 years in prison each in the Toshakhana-II corruption case.According to Dawn, the court also imposed a fine of Pakistani Rs 16.4 million on each of them, with additional jail time possible in case of non-payment. The case relates to the alleged illegal retention and sale of state gifts received while Khan was in office.The video from the Bradford rally was initially shared on X by the UK chapter of Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party before being deleted.Explaining the decision, PTI UK said in a post on X: “We have removed a video from the recent Bradford protest featuring a citizen’s metaphorical remarks regarding General Asim Munir. Although we do not believe the individual incited violence, the post was deleted in an abundance of caution to prevent potential misunderstanding and legal safeguarding of the individual and her rights.”Pakistan’s deputy interior minister Talal Chaudhry said the remarks crossed a red line. Speaking to Geo Television, he said: “While Imran Khan’s party has been inciting supporters against the military, the car bomb threat at the Bradford rally crossed all limits. It does not fall into the category of freedom of speech.”He urged the UK government to investigate the incident and take legal action if laws were violated.Responding to Pakistan’s concerns, the UK High Commission in Islamabad said in a brief statement: “Where a foreign Government believes a crime has been committed, they should provide all relevant material to their UK police liaison. Any material that appears to break UK law will be reviewed by the police and may lead to a criminal investigation.”The diplomatic move comes amid escalating tensions between Khan’s supporters and Pakistan’s powerful military. Earlier this month, army spokesperson Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry described Khan as “mentally ill” during a press conference, after posts on Khan’s official X account referred to General Munir as “mentally unstable,” according to the Associated Press.Separately, tensions escalated further after PTI said Shahzad Akbar, a former adviser to Imran Khan was attacked in the United Kingdom on Thursday.In a post on X, Akbar said he was assaulted outside his home in Cambridge by an unidentified man.“Yesterday at approximately 8:08 a.m., I was attacked at my home by an unknown assailant dressed in what appeared to be construction or waste-collection attire,” Akbar wrote. “The individual asked, ‘Are you Shahzad Akbar?’ and immediately began assaulting me. The incident occurred in the presence of my family.”Akbar said he sustained facial injuries, including bruising and a fractured nose, and was taken to a local hospital before being discharged.“The police have taken cognizance of the matter and have assured me and my family that they are actively investigating this targeted attack and will work to apprehend both the perpetrator and those behind it,” he said.He added that he could not share further details at this stage, including CCTV footage, on the advice of authorities.“I have full faith in the rule of law and in British law enforcement to carry out their duties,” Akbar said, urging the UK government to ensure the safety of dissidents.In a follow-up statement, Akbar said the attack would not silence him.“I want to make one thing absolutely clear: If my views, political comments, or even my ‘face’ is not liked by anyone, such cowardly acts will only strengthen my resolve rather than silence me,” he wrote. “Violence will not intimidate me or deter me from speaking out.”The Pakistan government has previously submitted extradition documents to British authorities seeking Akbar’s return. Akbar, a PTI member, has been accused by the state of anti-government activities.",Pakistan summons Britain’s deputy high commissioner Matt Cannell.

'Just a junta with nuclear weapons': When Bush and Putin discussed Pakistan in 2005; what declassified NSA documents show,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/just-a-junta-with-nuclear-weapons-when-bush-and-putin-discussed-pakistan-in-2005-what-declassified-nsa-documents-show/articleshow/126187276.cms,"Putin Called Pakistan A Junta With Nukes As Bush Feared Nuclear Leaks To Iran, Reveal Transcripts





NEW DELHI: Pakistan’s nuclear proliferation programme triggered deep concern at the highest levels of the United States and Russia, with both countries expressing that Islamabad’s nuclear activities made them “nervous”, according to newly declassified documents released by the US National Security Archive.The documents, made public this week following a Freedom of Information lawsuit, include verbatim transcripts of meetings and phone calls between former US president George W Bush and Russian president Vladimir Putin between 2001 and 2008. They reveal repeated discussions on Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal, links to Iran’s nuclear programme, and the role of the AQ Khan proliferation network.In a key Oval Office meeting in 2005, Putin raised concerns over evidence suggesting Pakistani-origin uranium had been found in Iranian centrifuges, questioning Western tolerance of Islamabad despite its proliferation record.“But it's not clear what the labs (Iran) have, where they are. Cooperation with Pakistan still exists,” Putin said during the meeting.Bush responded by referring to his discussions with then Pakistani president Pervez Musharraf, saying, “I talked to Musharraf about that. I told him we're worried about transfers to Iran and North Korea. They put AQ Khan in jail, and some of his buddies under house arrest. We want to know what they said.I keep reminding Musharraf of that. Either he's getting nothing, or he's not being forthcoming.”Putin reiterated his concerns, stating, “As far as I understand, they found uranium of Pakistani origin in the centrifuges.”Bush acknowledged the issue, saying, “Yes, the stuff the Iranians forgot to tell the IAEA about. That's a violation.”“It was of Pakistani origin. That makes me nervous,” Putin said, to which Bush replied, “It makes us nervous, too.”Also read: 'I want Pak': Rajnath recalls Vajpayee's unmatched wit; all about iconic moment The documents also highlight Putin’s blunt assessment of Pakistan during an earlier meeting with Bush in Slovenia in 2001. “I am concerned about Pakistan. It is just a junta with nuclear weapons. It is no democracy, yet the West makes no criticism of it. Should talk about it,” Putin said.According to the transcripts, both leaders expressed anxiety about Pakistan’s internal political instability, its military-led governance under Musharraf, and the risk that sensitive nuclear technology could fall into the wrong hands. The discussions repeatedly returned to the AQ Khan network, which was later confirmed to have supplied nuclear technology to Iran, North Korea, and Libya.The declassified records underscore longstanding international concerns about Pakistan’s nuclear command and control systems and the broader implications of its proliferation activities.The revelations come amid renewed scrutiny of Pakistan’s nuclear conduct. Last month, India criticised Islamabad following remarks by US President Donald Trump alleging that Pakistan had been secretly testing nuclear weapons.Reacting to Trump’s comments, Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said such actions were consistent with Pakistan’s history. “Clandestine and illegal nuclear activities are in keeping with Pakistan's history, which is centred around decades of smuggling, export control violations, secret partnerships, AQ Khan network and further proliferation,” he said.“India has always drawn the attention of the international community to these aspects of Pakistan's record,” Jaiswal added."," transcripts of meetings and phone calls between former US president George W Bush and Russian president Vladimir Putin released by US National Security Archive.

Pak PM Sharif's Party Leader Threatens India, Warns Missiles Will Respond If Bangladesh Is Targeted





In a sharp attack on Pakistan’s security establishment, Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman accused the military leadership of employing a “double standard” regarding cross-border military operations. Speaking at a recent gathering in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the influential Deobandi cleric questioned the logical consistency of Pakistan’s defence policy, specifically contrasting Islamabad’s recent strikes in Afghanistan with its diplomatic outrage over Indian activities within Pakistani borders.He asked Pakistan’s military brass why India’s actions inside Pakistan should be condemned when Islamabad justifies strikes in Afghanistan by calling them attacks on its enemies. Rehman argued that if Pakistan claimed a sovereign right to launch pre-emptive or retaliatory strikes against perceived enemies on Afghan soil, it weakened its moral and legal standing when protesting similar actions by India. “We sent militants to Afghanistan for 20 years. .. from giving them Kalashnikovs to Cruise missiles... we empowered them in every way. When you bombed Kabul, it was as if someone had bombed your Islamabad.This is the limit, isn’t it? If you had bombed the remote areas, you might have been able to tolerate it. So, you took some action there as well...”“...If you say, and I have questions, that we have attacked the enemy’s headquarters and you call this a legitimate statement, India says to you that it has attacked Bahawalpur, it has attacked Muridke, it has attacked the headquarters of those who are operating against us in Kashmir. Why are you objecting to this? And if you object to this, and if you have the same claims against Afghanistan, how will you justify it..?”Rehman’s criticism comes at a time when Pakistan’s Field Marshal Asim Munir continues his anti-India rhetoric and claims that Pakistan received “divine help” during the military confrontation with India in May which was felt during the days of intense fighting that followed Indian strikes on terror targets.Rehman’s comments touch upon a sensitive nerve in geopolitics, specifically referring to locations like Bahawalpur and Muridke — areas long identified as hubs for terrorist groups like JeM and LeT — which were decimated during Operation Sindoor. By asking, “Why different rules for India?” Rehman highlighted the strategic hypocrisy: justification of “counterterrorism strikes” in the west, while demanding absolute territorial sanctity in the east.",Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman accused the military leadership of employing a “double standard” regarding cross-border military operations.

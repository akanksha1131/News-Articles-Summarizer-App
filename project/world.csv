Nepal In Flames: PM KP Oli Resigns, Flees In Army Chopper As Gen Z Protesters Burn Down Parliament





Days after massive unrest upended Nepal’s political situation, deposed Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has shifted from army protection to a private residence. According to news agency PTI, citing Nepal army sources, Oli spent nine days under army security before moving out.Oli had flown to an army barracks -- believed to be in the Shivapuri forest area, north of Kathmandu on September 9, immediately after the Gen Z-led protests turned violent and he resigned as Prime Minister.After nine days in army security, the chairman of the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist–Leninist) (CPN-UML) relocated to a private location, the Nepal Army confirmed.However, his current address has not been officially disclosed. Media reports indicate that Oli has shifted to a private house in the Gundu area of Bhaktapur district, about 15 km east of Kathmandu.During the second day of the protests on September 9, Gen Z demonstrators burned Oli’s house in Balkot, Bhaktapur, to ashes. On the same day, while Oli was at the official residence of the Nepal Prime Minister, protesters also partially torched the Prime Minister’s Office in Balkot. He was safely evacuated by a Nepal Army helicopter.Several other senior political figures -- including former Prime Ministers Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda,’ Sher Bahadur Deuba, Jhalanath Khanal, Madhav Kumar Nepal, and others -- had also taken shelter under army protection for a few days. At present, only Nepali Congress president Sher Bahadur Deuba and his spouse, former foreign minister Arzju Rana Deuba, remain under army security. The couple sustained injuries during the protests and are currently receiving hospital treatment under military protection.Meanwhile, the CPN-UML, led by Oli, is planning a separate event to mark Constitution Day on September 19 at Chyasal in Lalitpur district, where the party’s central office is located. However, it remains uncertain whether Oli will attend the programme.Nepal will observe Constitution Day on Ashoj 3 of the Bikram Era calendar—September 19 this year—marking the promulgation of the country’s constitution drafted by the Constituent Assembly on September 20, 2015.The Nepal government is organising a grand celebration in Kathmandu on September 19 to mark Constitution Day and has declared a public holiday for the occasion. President Ramchandra Paudel, Prime Minister Sushila Karki, the Nepal army chief, ministers and other dignitaries are scheduled to attend.","Deposed PM KP Sharma Oli has shifted from army protection to a private residence.

Strong quake jolts Russia: 7.8-magnitude earthquake hits Kamchatka region,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/strong-quake-jolts-russia-7-8-magnitude-earthquake-hits-kamchatka-region-shocking-visuals-emerge/articleshow/123987635.cms,"Russia On Tsunami Alert After Major 7.4 Magnitude Earthquake Strikes Kamchatka





A 7.8-magnitude earthquake hit Russia's Kamchatka region followed by several aftershocks on early Friday, prompting authorities to issue a tsunami alert, which was later lifted.Shocking visuals captured buildings swaying, furniture rattling, and light fixtures trembling inside homes, while another clip showed a parked car rocking violently on the street.""This morning is once again testing the resilience of Kamchatka residents,"" AFP quoted the governor of the region, Vladimir Solodov, said on Telegram.""There are currently no reports of damage.

This zone is notorious for frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, as several of the planet’s major tectonic plates constantly grind against one another.Kamchatka itself is dotted with active volcanoes and has a long history of powerful seismic jolts, making it one of the world’s most closely monitored regions for geological hazards.Only a few months ago, in July, the area was rocked by an 8.8-magnitude mega-quake off its coast. The tremor unleashed a tsunami that swallowed parts of a coastal village and sent waves racing across the Pacific, prompting widespread warnings in countries thousands of kilometres away.","A 7.8-magnitude earthquake hit Russia's Kamchatka region followed by several aftershocks on early Friday, prompting authorities to issue a tsunami alert.

"UAE cuts interest rates after US Fed’s decision: What it means for your loans, savings, and investments",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-cuts-interest-rates-after-us-feds-decision-what-it-means-for-your-loans-savings-and-investments/articleshow/123965156.cms,"The UAE lowered its key interest rate by 25 basis points to 4.15%, following the US Federal Reserve’s recent cut

UAE mirrors US Fed's rate cut

Impact on borrowing costs, sectoral outlook

Real Estate: Falling mortgage rates may reignite demand in Dubai’s property market, especially among first-time buyers and investors seeking leveraged exposure.



Retail and Tourism: Lower interest rates can boost disposable income and spur consumer demand, supporting domestic consumption and inbound travel.



SMEs and Corporates: Easier access to cheaper financing may encourage business expansion, especially for small and medium enterprises and capital-intensive industries.





Why the UAE Dirham is pegged to USD





What is a currency peg?





Reduced exchange rate risk in trade and investment



Greater price stability in imported goods



Enhanced investor confidence due to currency predictability





Behind the Fed's move

Slowing job gains



A slight uptick in the unemployment rate, although it remains relatively low



Moderated economic growth in the first half of 2025



Elevated inflation, particularly in core categories









In a significant shift aligned with the US Federal Reserve’s latest monetary policy easing, the Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE) has reduced its base interest rate by 25 basis points to 4.15%, effective September 18, 2025. The rate cut marks the UAE’s response to changing global economic signals and is expected to lower borrowing costs, potentially stimulating sectors like real estate, tourism, and small business growth, while also impacting savings and investment preferences.On September 18, 2025, the Central Bank of the UAE lowered the Base Rate applicable to the Overnight Deposit Facility (ODF) by 25 basis points, from 4.40% to 4.15%. This move directly followed the US Federal Reserve’s decision the previous day to reduce its Interest Rate on Reserve Balances (IORB) by the same margin.The UAE’s base rate, which serves as a floor for overnight money market interest rates, is anchored to the Fed’s IORB. Given the UAE dirham’s long-standing peg to the US dollar, changes in US interest rates are typically mirrored in the Emirates to maintain monetary stability.In addition to adjusting the base rate, the CBUAE announced that it would maintain the spread for borrowing short-term liquidity from the central bank at 50 basis points above the base rate across all standing credit facilities.This is the first interest rate cut in the UAE since the Fed’s last policy shift in December 2024, when rates were reduced to a range of 4.25%–4.50%. With the current adjustment, the Fed’s target federal funds rate now stands at 4.00%–4.25%, the lowest level since November 2022.The UAE’s rate cut is expected to translate into lower borrowing costs, with wide-ranging implications for consumer spending, business investment, and credit activity.Key sectors likely to benefit:Conversely, traditional savers and fixed-income investors may feel the downside. Returns on fixed deposits and bonds are likely to decline, pushing individuals and institutions toward riskier asset classes such as equities or real estate.Stock markets, especially those rich in growth and dividend-paying companies, are expected to benefit from the rate environment, although volatility may persist due to lingering global macroeconomic uncertainties.The UAE’s monetary policy is heavily influenced by its currency peg to the US dollar, a regime that has been in place since 1997. The exchange rate has been fixed at 1 USD = 3.6725 AED, offering a stable foundation for trade, investment, and macroeconomic planning.The peg plays a crucial role in simplifying oil trade transactions, given that oil exports are globally priced in US dollars. This alignment shields the UAE from exchange rate volatility and enhances confidence among international investors.A currency peg, or fixed exchange rate, is a mechanism by which a country’s central bank maintains its currency’s value at a constant rate against a foreign currency or a basket of currencies. The primary benefits include:As of 2024, 12 countries peg their currencies to the US dollar, with the UAE being one of the most prominent examples in the Middle East.Because of this peg, monetary policy independence in the UAE is limited. The Central Bank typically aligns its interest rate decisions with the Fed to maintain the stability of the peg and prevent capital flight or currency arbitrage.The US Federal Reserve’s rate cut on September 17, 2025, was its first of the year, driven by growing signs of a cooling labor market and persistent political pressures, including tariff-related inflationary concerns.According to the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), recent economic data pointed to:The Fed emphasized that further policy adjustments will be contingent on incoming data, the evolving economic outlook, and risk assessments. This suggests a cautious but flexible approach to monetary easing in the months ahead.","The Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE) has reduced its base interest rate by 25 basis points to 4.15%, effective September 18, 2025.

JD Vance hosts 'The Charlie Kirk Show': US VP lashes out at liberals; recalls Erika’s tribute,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/jd-vance-hosts-the-charlie-kirk-show-us-vp-lashes-out-at-liberals-recalls-erikas-tribute/articleshow/123911323.cms,"Trump Unleashes Crackdown After Kirk’s Murder: Visa Bans, Mass Firings, Military Probes Sweep US





US Vice-President JD Vance has said that national unity is impossible with people who celebrate the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk , warning that such behaviour fuels further political violence.Speaking as guest host of The Charlie Kirk Show on Monday, Vance said: “Call them out, and hell, call their employer. We don't believe in political violence, but we do believe in civility.”The vice-president took over presenting duties from his ceremonial office at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, with the programme livestreamed into the White House press briefing room. It was the first episode of the podcast since Kirk, 31, was fatally shot in the neck while moderating a debate at Utah Valley University last week.Vance, who flew Kirk’s body home to Arizona aboard Air Force Two, said he was “filling in for somebody who cannot be filled in for”. He recounted conversations with Kirk’s widow Erika, describing him as “a kind, loving husband”, and admitted her words had inspired him to “be a better husband and… a better father”.In his remarks, Vance directly challenged those making light of Kirk’s assassination. “There is no unity with the people who celebrate Charlie Kirk's assassination,” he said.“There is no unity with someone who lies about what Charlie Kirk said in order to excuse his murder… And there is no unity with the people who fund these articles, who pay the salaries of these terrorist sympathisers who argue that Charlie Kirk, a loving husband and father, deserved a shot to the neck because he spoke words with which they disagree. ”He added: “I’m desperate for our country to be united in condemnation of the actions and the ideas that killed my friend. I want it so badly that I will tell you a difficult truth. We can only have it with people who acknowledge that political violence is unacceptable.”Other Republicans have echoed calls for accountability. Florida congressman Randy Fine said he would “demand their firing, defunding, and licence revocation”, while South Carolina’s Nancy Mace urged federal funding to be cut from universities that refuse to act.Vance, who described Kirk as a close friend and mentor, credited him with helping President Donald Trump’s re-election and with shaping the administration. “If it weren't for Charlie Kirk, I would not be the vice president of the United States,” he said.","US Vice-President JD Vance said national unity is impossible with people who celebrate the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

Understanding solar eclipses – Types and what to expect

Total solar eclipse



The Moon completely covers the Sun.

Observers in a narrow zone experience brief daylight darkness.

Spectacular but rare. Partial solar eclipse



Only part of the Sun is covered by the Moon.

Creates a crescent or “bitten” appearance of the Sun.

This is the type occurring on September 21, 2025. Annular solar eclipse



The Moon is farther from Earth and doesn’t fully cover the Sun.

A ring of sunlight remains visible, forming the “ring of fire” effect.





In an extraordinary celestial turn, September 2025 is bookended by two eclipses, a lunar eclipse on the 7th and a solar eclipse just 15 days later. While the Moon recently turned a vivid red in a dramatic lunar display, the sky will offer another rare phenomenon: a partial solar eclipse on September 21, timed just before the equinox. However, this spectacle won’t be visible everywhere, and the UAE is among the regions that will miss it.On September 21, 2025, a partial solar eclipse will occur near the equinox, visible mainly across select regions in the Southern Hemisphere. Unlike a total eclipse, this will be a partial solar eclipse, where the Moon covers only part of the Sun, creating a crescent-shaped sliver of sunlight. Even as a partial eclipse, it provides a rare chance to observe the Sun’s changing face.This event holds additional significance because it closely precedes the September equinox, which falls on September 22, 2025. The equinox is one of two moments in the year when the Sun is directly above the Earth’s equator, resulting in nearly equal day and night lengths across the globe. Because of this timing, the eclipse is also being called an ""equinox eclipse"", adding to its astronomical and symbolic intrigue.This partial solar eclipse offers a unique chance for skywatchers in the Southern Hemisphere to observe the dynamic alignment of the Sun and Moon just before the autumnal equinox.The event also carries cultural and astrological meaning. This year's Pitru Paksha — a fortnight in the Hindu calendar dedicated to ancestral remembrance and rituals — uniquely begins with a lunar eclipse and ends with this solar eclipse, a rare alignment astrologers consider especially potent. This celestial pairing not only marks an important astronomical event but also deepens the spiritual significance of Pitru Paksha for many observers.Also Read: Saudi National Day 2025 The September 21 partial solar eclipse will be visible only in specific parts of the Southern Hemisphere, offering clear views to skywatchers in select regions.Skywatchers in visible regions must use proper solar filters or eclipse glasses to view the partial eclipse safely.Unlike the lunar eclipse on September 7, which had wide visibility across many countries, this solar eclipse will not be visible in the UAE or most parts of the Northern Hemisphere.Countries that will not witness any part of the eclipse include:This means millions of skywatchers across Asia and the Americas will miss the event entirely — a sharp contrast to the global excitement generated by the earlier lunar eclipse.A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon moves between the Earth and the Sun, partially or fully blocking sunlight in specific areas on Earth. These alignments don’t happen frequently in the same place due to the precise positioning required.There are three main types of solar eclipses:Although this particular eclipse is not a total one, its timing, rarity, and symbolic links to the equinox and Pitru Paksha make it a notable event in the 2025 celestial calendar. This rare equinox eclipse marks the final solar eclipse of 2025, making it a fitting conclusion to a year rich in celestial and symbolic events.","The final solar eclipse of 2025 on September 21 will be partially visible in southern Australia.

Gaza ceasefire: US again vetoes UN resolution; vote held as Israeli offensive raged on,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/gaza-ceasefire-us-again-vetoes-un-resolution-vote-held-as-israeli-offensive-raged-on/articleshow/123989179.cms,"14 nations backed the UN resolution on Gaza ceasefire but US used its veto power to thwart it.





The United States vetoed a UN Security Council resolution on Thursday demanding an immediate and permanent ceasefire in Gaza and hostage release, citing insufficient condemnation of Hamas.The remaining 14 Security Council members supported the resolution, which highlighted Gaza's 'catastrophic' humanitarian situation and urged Israel to remove aid delivery restrictions affecting 2.1 million Palestinians.The vote came as Israeli tanks and jets pounded Gaza City, the target of a major new ground offensive, forcing Palestinians to flee south.The vote underscores US and Israeli isolation regarding the Gaza conflict, preceding the UN General Assembly where Gaza will be prominent.

New Twist? Teacher claims Celeste Rivas ran off with D4vd; shares photo in class,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/new-twist-teacher-claims-celeste-rivas-ran-off-with-d4vd-shares-photo-in-class/articleshow/123987918.cms,"



A former teacher of Celeste Rivas, the 15-year-old girl whose body was discovered inside singer D4vd’s car, has made a startling claim about her past, TMZ reported. Speaking in front of students, the science teacher alleged that Rivas first vanished after meeting the rising artist on social media and even ran away with him to Hollywood before being brought back home by police.As per TMZ, the teacher, who previously taught Rivas at Lakeland Village Middle School in Lake Elsinore, California, told his current pupils that he wanted to share her story as a “cautionary tale” about the dangers of online connections. He displayed a photo of himself with Rivas taken years earlier and claimed she had been “missing since I taught her.” He added that she disappeared a second time in May 2024, and he had not heard of her again until police confirmed her death this month.Rivas was identified by the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner as the girl found inside a bag in the front trunk of a Tesla registered to 20-year-old singer David Anthony Burke, known as D4vd. The car, with Texas plates, had been abandoned on a Los Angeles street before being towed to a Hollywood lot, where workers discovered her remains on 8 September. Officials said the cause of death remains “deferred” pending further examination.TMZ reported that it received a tip about Rivas being the victim and contacted her mother, who recognised a key detail. Police had mentioned a “Shhh…” tattoo on the victim’s finger, a tattoo her daughter also had. The mother further disclosed that Celeste had a boyfriend named David, and TMZ noted that the singer himself bears the same tattoo.Photographs reviewed by the outlet appeared to place D4vd in Lake Elsinore, near Rivas’s family home, months before her disappearance. Another image circulating online suggested he was with a girl resembling Rivas, though authorities have not confirmed this.The singer, who rose to fame with his 2022 viral hit *Romantic Homicide*, has since cancelled upcoming concerts, including one in Seattle. Police have not said whether he is being treated as a suspect, and neither he nor his representatives have issued a statement as the investigation continues.","Celeste Rivas, 15, was found dead in the trunk of singer D4vd's car on 8 September.

Utah Attorney Exposes Stunning Details About Kirk's Killer; 'Delete Texts & Stay Silent'

Past remarks on Kirk’s assassination :

Republican backlash and resolution to strip committees:



Trump joins in with criticism:

.





Democratic Representative Ilhan Omar has drawn widespread backlash after calling people who are honoring slain conservative leader Charlie Kirk “full of s***.” Speaking at an event, Omar said Kirk was a “hateful man” and accused his supporters of “rewriting history.”“I do believe those of you interested in rewriting this hateful man’s history are full of sht,” Omar declared. This prompted immediate backlash from Republicans and Kirk’s supporters.Omar had previously reacted to Kirk’s assassination during an interview with journalist Mehdi Hasan on his Zeteo platform. She condemned Republican attacks on the left in the aftermath of the shooting, calling them “full of s***.”“You have people like Nancy Mace, who constantly harass, you know, people that she finds inferior and wants them not to exist in this country or ever,” Omar told Hasan, as reported by the Hill.“And, you know, you have people like Trump, who has incited violence against people like me. And so, you know, these people are full of s***, and it’s important for us to call them out while we feel anger and sadness,” she added.Omar also said the video and news of Kirk’s killing were deeply disturbing. “It was really mortifying to hear the news, to see the video. You know, all I could think about was his wife, his children, that image is going to live forever,” she said.Kirk’s death had already triggered a heated political debate. Her remarks prompted Republican Representative Nancy Mace to introduce a resolution to strip Omar of her committee assignments, accusing her of “smearing” Kirk and “implying he was to blame for his own murder,” as reported by the Independent.In a post on X, Mace said: “Nothing warms our hearts more than the flood of calls from Ilhan Omar's own district backing our move to censure her and strip her committees. One caller put it best: ‘She’s Somalia First.’”President Donald Trump also weighed in, telling reporters in the Oval Office that he supported removing Omar from her committee roles, according to New York Post.“I think she’s a disgraceful person,” Trump said. “You know, I think she’s a disgraceful person, a loser. It’s amazing the way people vote — I know it’s people from her area, maybe all over the world. They got here, and they vote her in. It’s hard to believe, but I think she’s a disgusting person.”This is not the first time the US president has slammed the congresswoman. In a recent post on Truth Social, Trump wrote, “Ilhan Omar’s Country of Somalia is plagued by a lack of central Government control, persistent Poverty, Hunger, Resurgent Terrorism, Piracy, decades of Civil War, Corruption and pervasive Violence. 70% of the population lives in extreme Poverty, and widespread Food Insecurity. Somalia is consistently ranked among the World’s Most Corrupt Countries, including Bribery, Embezzlement, and a Dysfunctional Government.""All of this, and Ilhan Omar tells us how to run America! P.S. Wasn’t she the one that married her brother in order to gain Citizenship??? What SCUM we have in our Country, telling us what to do, and how to do it. Thank you for your attention to this matter. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!,"" the post added.Claims that Omar married her brother have circulated for years. Omar has denied that she and her second husband were related and has pushed back forcefully against posts repeating the allegation. When a post recently claimed to “confirm” the marriage, Omar replied: “The only thing that is confirmed is your stupidity, hope that helps.”Omar, who fled Somalia with her family during the country’s bloody civil war, spent four years in a Kenyan refugee camp before being granted asylum in the United States in 1995.Charlie Kirk was assassinated last week while speaking at an outdoor event in Utah. Prosecutors announced that the 22-year-old Tyler Robinson accused of killing Kirk during his appearance at Utah Valley University has been charged with capital murder and they intend to seek the death penalty.","Democratic Representative Ilhan Omar has drawn widespread backlash after calling people who are honoring slain conservative leader Charlie Kirk “full of s***” Republican Representative Nancy Mace introduced a resolution to strip Omar of her committee assignments.

A US Army MH-60 Black Hawk helicopter carrying four service members crashed during a routine training mission near Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington state late Wednesday, sparking a wildfire and prompting a large-scale emergency response.The Army confirmed the incident in a statement on Thursday, but did not disclose the condition of those on board. The helicopter belonged to the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, known as the “Night Stalkers.” The cause of the crash remains under investigation.“This remains an active, ongoing situation,” the Army said. Army spokesperson Ruth Castro told the Associated Press that the incident was being treated as a search mission, adding that the “most professional and skilled” personnel were handling the response and were fully cooperating with law enforcement.The helicopter went down at around 9 p.m. local time in the Summit Lake area, west of Olympia, according to local officials. The crash ignited a fire that had grown to about one acre by Thursday morning, said the Washington Department of Natural Resources. Crews from multiple agencies, including military units and wildfire staff, were deployed to contain the blaze.Thurston County Sheriff Derek Sanders said deputies reached the crash site but were initially unable to continue rescue efforts because of the fire.“Deputies have located the crash site but have been unable to continue rescue efforts as the scene is on fire and is starting to overheat their footwear,” he said on Facebook.Rescue helicopters, including King County’s Guardian 1, and special operations units were also dispatched to the area. Flight-tracking data suggested the Black Hawk’s signal was last detected shortly before 8 p.m., about 2.5 miles east-southeast of Summit Lake.Joint Base Lewis-McChord, which is jointly operated by the Army and Air Force, is about 10 miles south of Tacoma and home to around 40,000 active-duty troops.","Army MH-60 Black Hawk helicopter carrying four service members crashes near Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington state.

US President Donald Trump ’s helicopter was forced into an unscheduled landing on Thursday after a hydraulic fault grounded Marine One during his return to Stansted Airport at the end of his state visit to Britain.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed the incident was caused by a “minor hydraulic issue.” She said: “Out of an abundance of caution, the pilots landed at a local airfield before reaching Stansted Airport. The president and first lady safely boarded the support helicopter.”The diversion saw Marine One land at Luton, where emergency services were waiting on the tarmac.

Trump praised them as “two fantastic people” and said he was “tremendously thankful” for their hospitality.No injuries were reported after the helicopter landing, and Trump departed Britain later that evening.","US President Donald Trump’s helicopter forced into an unscheduled landing on Thursday.

Tragedy at Epic Universe: Guest dies on roller coaster; autopsy reveals blunt impact injuries,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/tragedy-at-epic-universe-guest-dies-on-roller-coaster-autopsy-reveals-blunt-impact-injuries/articleshow/123987505.cms,"



A man has died after riding a roller coaster at Universal Orlando Resort’s newly opened Epic Universe theme park. The Orange County Sheriff’s Office confirmed that 32-year-old Kevin Rodriguez Zavala was found unresponsive on the Stardust Racers attraction on Wednesday and was transported to hospital, where he was pronounced dead.The medical examiner for Orange and Osceola counties, Joshua Stephany, determined the cause of death to be “multiple blunt impact injuries” and ruled the death an accident . No further details were given about the injuries. “We are devastated by this tragic event and extend our sincerest sympathies to the guest’s loved ones,” Universal Orlando Resort said in a statement. “We are fully cooperating with Orange County and the ongoing investigation.”Stardust Racers, described by the resort as “a breathtaking, dual-launch coaster reaching incredible speeds up to 62 mph,” was closed immediately after the incident on 17 September and has remained shut during the investigation. The ride, which opened with the park in May, features 5,000 feet of track and is one of Epic Universe’s main attractions.Industry experts have questioned the autopsy’s findings, with Dennis Speigel, CEO of International Theme Park Services, saying the conclusion was “pretty shocking” and raised more questions than it answered.“Was it the head or the chest? Was he banging around? Was he in his seat properly? Was it an accident caused by the ride or him doing something?” he asked.Epic Universe, the first major theme park to open in Florida since 1999, is Universal’s fourth park in the state and includes themed sections such as Super Nintendo World and the Ministry of Magic from the Harry Potter franchise. Florida’s largest theme parks are exempt from state safety inspections and instead conduct their own, but they are required to report injuries or deaths.According to state records, three incidents have already been reported at Epic Universe since its opening in May, including guests experiencing dizziness, chest pains and other health issues on rides. The investigation into Zavala’s death is ongoing, with Universal confirming that it cannot comment further while authorities review the circumstances.","A 32-year-old man has died after riding a roller coaster at Universal Orlando Resort’s newly opened Epic Universe theme park.

Late-night host Jimmy Kimmel said he would not apologise for remarks blaming MAGA supporters for the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk — and instead planned to double down on his attacks against US President Donald Trump ’s backers before being pulled off the air, according to reports.Kimmel learned in a phone call from top Disney executive Dana Walden on Wednesday afternoon, after his Monday night monologue, that his show was being removed indefinitely, Deadline reported, citing sources.During the call, the 57-year-old host refused to apologise despite pressure from critics and from owners of dozens of affiliate stations of Disney-owned ABC, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Kimmel told executives he did not believe his remarks warranted an apology and maintained that his comments had been “misinterpreted.”Sources said Kimmel had been prepared to clarify his remarks on air, insisting he was referring to the “MAGA gang” for “desperately” trying to link accused gunman Tyler Robinson to left-wing ideology. Robinson, 22, has been indicted for the September 10 murder of Kirk at a university campus in Utah.Disney executives, however, feared that allowing Kimmel to double down on his MAGA comments would require a “more drastic decision” than simply suspending the show. The company also attracted criticism from Federal Communications Commission chairman Brendan Carr, a Trump appointee, whose “warning” was played a major role in ABC's decision to pull the programme off air.The move to suspend ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!"" has itself sparked widespread condemnation.","Kimmel learned in a phone call from top Disney executive Dana Walden on Wednesday afternoon, after his Monday night monologue.

More Than 150,000 Evacuated in Pakistan Punjab After India’s Flood Alert

Waters recede, but threat not over

Fields and cattle lost





Even as floodwaters began to recede in parts of south Punjab, the scale of destruction remains staggering, nearly 2.5 million people have been forced to flee their homes and at least 101 lives have been lost, the Dawn reported.The Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) has called the ongoing evacuation and relief drive one of the largest in recent memory. More than 1,500 boats were deployed to rescue stranded families, with 12,427 people evacuated from villages along the Chenab, Ravi and Sutlej rivers.Multan, Muzaffargarh and Rahim Yar Khan districts bore the brunt of the floods. Entire villages were submerged — including the union council of Lati Mari in Alipur tehsil, home to 40,000 people.“Nearly 15,000 people from our basti had to leave on their own as water rose,” said Syed Kausar Shah, a local resident. “Homes and crops were destroyed, and people escaped on a hired boat. Some now live in relief camps, others under the open sky.” He added that two villagers drowned while attempting to flee.Officials declared Jalalpur Pirwala and Alipur tehsils safe after a major flood wave passed through Head Panjnad.Multan Deputy Commissioner Waseem Hamid Sindhu confirmed that 100,000 people had been evacuated from Jalalpur Pirwala alone in three days.Breaches in Shujabad and Jalalpur Pirwala are now being filled, while helicopters and drones drop food and medicine into cut-off areas. Boats continue to ferry supplies into rural belts.At a press briefing in Bahawalpur, PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said Panjnad Headworks still faced a “high flood” but levels had dropped from 700,000 cusecs earlier this week to 575,000 cusecs on Saturday. By evening, the Flood Forecasting Division reported further decline to 492,695 cusecs.“There is no threat to Jalalpur Pirwala and Alipur cities,” Kathia assured, adding that water in Bahawalpur would also recede within 24 hours. He called the scale of evacuation “historic,” stressing that Multan could have faced forced evacuations if operations were delayed.According to official data, 4,447 mouzas across 28 districts have been inundated. Alongside the mass displacement of people, more than 2.19 million cattle were rescued and shifted to higher ground.For now, the rivers appear to be calming, the Sutlej at Ganda Singh Wala was recorded at 95,000 cusecs, categorised as medium flood.

Protests Erupt in Pakistan, as Imran Khan Supporters Call for His Release

The sons of jailed former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said their father “will not be broken” by his “unlawful” imprisonment, as his legal team lodged an appeal with the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture.The elder son, Sulaiman Khan, condemned Khan's treatment in a statement attached to the appeal:Our father is being kept in conditions that no human being should endure. These are violations of his rights, and they amount to torture.”The younger son, Kasim Khan, said:The UN has already recognised that our father’s imprisonment is arbitrary and unlawful. What he is enduring now shows how far the regime will go to break him. But he will not be broken.”Sulaiman and Kasim are the cricketer-turned-politician’s sons with British filmmaker Jemima Goldsmith, with whom he was married for nine years until 2004. They live in the UK with Goldsmith.The appeal, filed by the US-based law firm Perseus Strategies on behalf of Khan’s legal team, alleged a “systematic pattern of abuse, including prolonged solitary confinement, denial of medical care, contaminated food, and restricted access to legal counsel and family visits.”His lawyers argued that these conditions breach Pakistan’s obligations under the UN Convention against Torture (CAT) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).

Aid meant for relief diverted?

Poll Do you believe the reconstruction of LeT's Markaz Taiba is a threat to regional security? Yes, it poses a significant threat. No, it will not impact security.

How India destroyed LeT HQ



Why its reconstruction is a matter of concern?







Pakistan is financing the reconstruction of Lashkar-e-Taiba’s (LeT) Muridke headquarters, Markaz Taiba, which was destroyed in precision airstrikes during Operation Sindoor on May 7. According to ANI, citing an agency dossier, LeT has launched fundraising campaigns under the pretext of flood relief to support the redevelopment project.Moreover, Islamabad has already allocated PKR 4 crore, though the group estimates costs at over PKR 15 crore. The dossier stated that its army and ISI remain involved in sustaining and reviving LeT.Senior commanders Maulana Abu Zar and Yunus Shah Bukhari are overseeing the project, due by February 2026, mirroring past cases where LeT diverted humanitarian aid, including most of the 2005 earthquake relief, to militant infrastructure.This comes amidst Pakistan's continuous assertions on global platforms that it was combating terrorism.The Indian Air Force (IAF), earlier this year, showcased the extensive damage caused to LeT Muridke headquarters during Operation Sindoor, highlighting the precision and reach of the strikes.Muridke, home to LeT’s Markaz Taiba, was identified as a critical target. The strikes hit senior leadership residential areas and office buildings where commanders convened for planning and operations.The IAF showed videos captured directly from the weapons, pointing out the level of devastation within the complex.The airstrikes reportedly killed around a dozen high-value terrorists, including Yusuf Azhar, the IC-814 hijacker, Abu Jundal (also known as Mudassar), the Muridke chief of LeT, and the son of the planner of the 2016 Nagrota attack. The operation, conducted in retaliation for the Pahalgam killings, reinforced India’s ability to carry out precise, high-impact missions inside enemy territory.The ongoing reconstruction of LeT Markaz Taiba headquarters has raised serious concerns regarding regional security, given the facility’s central role in training and radicalizing terrorists. Established in 2000, the complex serves as both a residence for senior commanders and a training ground where recruits are instructed in intelligence gathering, arms handling, and other operational skills. Analysts warn that reviving the facility could strengthen LeT’s operational capabilities and enable the recruitment of new militants.Markaz Taiba functions as the “alma mater” of LeT, providing courses that combine physical and arms training with ideological indoctrination. The center attracts recruits from within Pakistan and abroad, using religious and radicalization programs to cultivate loyalty and operational skills among future militants. Its facilities, including a mosque and guest house financed by Osama bin Laden, underscore the longstanding support the organization has received from international terror networks.The scale of the operation at Markaz Taiba further amplifies the threat. The facility reportedly trains around 1,000 students annually, preparing them for operational roles within LeT. Past evidence has shown that graduates of this center have gone on to participate in high-profile attacks, including the 26/11 Mumbai attacks, highlighting the direct link between the facility and acts of cross-border terrorism targeting India.LeT’s historical connection with Pakistan’s intelligence apparatus adds another layer of concern. Senior commanders at the facility, including those who oversaw training for the 26/11 perpetrators, have operated under the guidance of the ISI.","Pakistan is financing the reconstruction of Lashkar-e-Taiba’s (LeT) Muridke headquarters, Markaz Taiba.

A Pakistani Taliban ambush in northwest Pakistan on Saturday resulted in the deaths of at least 12 soldiers, as confirmed by local government and security officials to AFP.During a military convoy's passage through South Waziristan district at 4:00 am, ""armed men opened fire from both sides with heavy weapons"", resulting in 12 security personnel deaths and four injuries, according to a local government official.The area's security officer verified the casualties and reported that the assailants captured the convoy's weaponry.The Tehreek-e-Taliban (TTP), also known as the Pakistani Taliban, took responsibility for the attack via social media.This incident ranks among the most severe attacks in recent months within Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where the TTP previously controlled significant territories until a 2014 military operation forced their retreat.Since the Afghan Taliban's return to power in Kabul in 2021, militant activities have intensified in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border regions. Although distinct organisations, the TTP maintains close ties with the Afghan Taliban.Pakistan contends that Afghanistan fails to remove militants who use Afghan soil to attack Pakistan, whilst Kabul authorities reject these claims.Local residents across various Khyber Pakhtunkhwa districts have recently reported TTP-branded graffiti appearing on buildings, expressing concerns about a potential return to the group's previous control during the height of the US ""War on Terror"".A high-ranking local government official recently informed AFP about increased TTP fighter presence and attack frequency.Since January 1, approximately 460 individuals, predominantly security forces personnel, have lost their lives in attacks by anti-state armed groups in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan provinces, according to AFP's records.Pakistan experienced its most lethal period in nearly ten years during the previous year, with over 1,600 fatalities, including almost half being soldiers and police officers, as reported by the Islamabad-based Center for Research and Security Studies.","Pakistani Taliban ambush in northwest Pakistan kills at least 12 soldiers.

Poll Is it ethical for governments to use technology from foreign countries for surveillance? Yes, if it protects citizens No, it compromises sovereignty





Pakistan — with the help of Chinese technology — is spying on millions of its citizens to curb dissent and free speech, an Amnesty International report said.According to the report, Pakistan is using a Chinese-built internet firewall that censors social media, enabling spy agencies to monitor at least 4 million mobile phones at a time through its Lawful Intercept Management System (LIMS). The firewall, known as WMS 2.0, inspects internet traffic and can block 2 million active sessions at once.The human rights watchdog said it reviewed licensing agreements, trade data, leaked technical files, and Chinese records linking the firewall supplier to state-owned firms in Beijing.Amnesty said the firewall uses equipment from US-based Niagara Networks, software from Thales DIS — a unit of France's Thales — and servers from a Chinese state IT firm. An earlier version relied on Canada’s Sandvine.""The two monitoring systems function in tandem: one lets intelligence agencies tap calls and texts, while the other slows or blocks websites and social media across the country,"" the report said.""Mass surveillance creates a chilling effect in society, whereby people are deterred from exercising their rights, both online and offline,"" it added.The report further said that Pakistan is currently blocking about 650,000 web links and restricting access to platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, and X.It also accused agencies of spying on at least 4 million mobile phones at a time through LIMS, while WMS 2.0 can block 2 million active sessions at once, Amnesty said.Amnesty noted that its findings draw on a 2024 Islamabad High Court case filed by Bushra Bibi, the wife of former Prime Minister Imran Khan, after her private calls were leaked online.In court, Pakistan's defense ministries and intelligence agencies denied running or even having the capacity for phone tapping. However, under questioning, the telecom regulator admitted it had already ordered phone companies to install LIMS for use by ""designated agencies.""Crackdowns have tightened in recent years, particularly after the military broke with then Prime Minister Imran Khan in 2022.

Aleema Khan, sister of Pakistan 's jailed former prime minister Imran Khan , was attacked with an egg while addressing reporters outside Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail on Friday.A video of the episode has gone viral on social media, showing the egg hitting Aleema as she spoke to the media.Supporters of Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party quickly apprehended two women accused of throwing the eggs and handed them over to police, news agency PTI reported.Rawalpindi police said the arrested women were PTI party supporters who had travelled with members of the All-Government Employees Grand Alliance to protest against unmet demands.The statement added that the egg was thrown after Aleema did not respond to questions from the two women. Both were later taken into custody and moved to the Adiala checkpoint.PTI condemned the act as “shameful,” alleging the women were planted for political motives and accusing police of helping them escape in a car. “The women were sent to Aleema's media talk as part of an agenda,” the party said.Leaders across the political spectrum criticized the attack.Balochistan National Party-Mengal chief Akhtar Mengal condemned the act, calling it “the lowest form of politics.”He said, “Even in enmity, a woman deserves dignity. Targeting women is the lowest form of politics, and this cheap stunt must be condemned in the strongest words.”Federal minister for development Ahsan Iqbal said, “Politics must remain a contest of ideas, not of violence or hatred. We should all work to keep it healthy and respectful.”Meanwhile, PML-N leader Khawaja Saad Rafique described the incident as “shameful, vile and crude.”Imran Khan has been in prison for more than two years facing multiple charges. In January 2025, a Pakistani tribunal sentenced the former prime minister to 14 years in prison, while his wife, Bushra Bibi, received a seven-year sentence in connection with a corruption case involving land graft.The allegations centred on the acceptance of land from a property magnate in exchange for facilitating money laundering during Khan’s tenure as prime minister.Prior to this verdict, Khan had received three separate convictions related to corruption, disclosure of state secrets, and violations of marriage laws, carrying sentences of 10, 14 and seven years respectively.","Aleema Khan was attacked with an egg while addressing reporters outside Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail on Friday.

A relatively unknown militant group, Ittihad-ul-Mujahideen (IuM) Pakistan, has claimed responsibility for the suicide car bomb attack on the Federal Constabulary Corps in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Bannu division on Tuesday.The outfit claimed the attack, which involved a car rigged with IED, killed more than two dozen members of the Frontier Corps but Pakistan acknowledged only six fatalities. Predictably, it blamed India for the attack. Pakistan claimed to have neutralised five operatives in a 12-hour counter operation but the group asserted that its 'fidayeen' blew themselves up after carrying out the attack. One of the suicide bombers was identified by the group as Abdul Aziz alias Qassid Mohajir, a resident of Afghanistan's Paktika province.The Pakistan army camp suffered massive destruction in the suicide attack. Pakistan military's ISPR played down the incident, the latest in a series of attacks on Pakistani military personnel. ""During early hours of Sept 2, Indian proxy 'Fitna al Khwarij' targeted the Federal Constabulary Headquarters in Bannu district. The Indian-sponsored Kharjis attempted to breach the perimeter security, however, their nefarious designs were swiftly foiled by vigilant and resolute response.In their desperation, the Kahrjis rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into the perimeter wall. The suicide blast resulted in the partial collapse of the perimeter wall and damage to adjacent civilian infrastructure, inflicting injuries to three innocent civilians,"" ISPR said.IuM Pakistan, active since April, comprises fighters from outfits like Hafiz Gul Bahadur Group, Lashkar-e-Islam and Jamaat-Ul-Ahrar. In the last few months, it has claimed multiple attacks in areas like North Waziristan, Miranshah and Tirah Valley. Its strikes included sniper, rocket launcher and grenade attacks, and ambushes on convoys, besides drone strikes. Its formation had attracted criticism from groups like Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan which termed itself as the most structured and legitimate jihadi group in Pakistan.","Ittihad-ul-Mujahideen (IuM) Pakistan has claimed responsibility for the suicide car bomb attack on the Federal Constabulary Corps in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Bannu division on Tuesday.

Two provincial officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed the death toll to AFP.Emergency services rushed to the scene as authorities launched an investigation into the attack.According to Dawn, Advocate Sajid Tareen, acting president of the BNP-M the attack took place shortly after a party rally marking the death anniversary of BNP founder Attaullah Mengal.A statement from the Balochistan Home Department confirmed that rescue teams had reached the site and that the wounded were being treated in local hospitals. Security forces swiftly cordoned off the area and have begun collecting evidence.Balochistan chief minister Sarfraz Bugti strongly condemned the attack, calling it a “cowardly act of enemies of humanity.” He said “malicious elements” were targeting innocent civilians and vowed that the “evil intentions of terrorists” would be defeated.No group has yet claimed responsibility.Pakistani forces have battled an insurgency in Balochistan for over a decade, with violence escalating in 2024 as 782 people were killed. In March, the Baloch Liberation Army seized a train, taking passengers hostage and killing off-duty troops in a three-day siege.Since January 1, over 430 people, mostly security forces, have died in attacks by armed groups in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

With Nepal slowly regaining normalcy after the deadly Sept 8-9 protests that left more than 70 people dead, police have turned their focus to identifying those behind the violence. The crackdown has triggered a 'digital retreat' among many protesters, who are deleting social media accounts or going silent online to avoid detection.Nepal police said they have received nearly 30,000 emails from citizens containing photos and videos that document arson, looting, and attacks on public buildings. The evidence was submitted after an appeal by police urging people to share digital material pertaining to the protests while promising not to disclose the identity of the senders to ensure their safety.DIG Binod Ghimire, spokesperson of Nepal police, said the huge volume of citizen responses received would aid the investigation. ""The videos and photos that we have got from citizens will help us track down those involved in the violence. We will analyse the data and act accordingly. We urge people to share more evidence, if any.""His statement came amid another appeal by Kathmandu police cautioning people against buying looted items.During the protests, many had looted valuables from banks, supermarkets, jewellery shops and other business establishments. Some perpetrators had also looted weapons and other items from police stations across the country.Earlier on Wednesday, ministers of the newly-formed interim govt visited the federal parliament building to assess the destruction. Rameshwor Prasad Khanal, the interim finance minister, said: ""The damage to properties is extensive across the country. We are assessing the loss after which necessary action would be taken to repair or rebuild properties. Our PM has already said that the vandalism and arson was a criminal act which will be punished. Police are therefore working towards bringing the perpetrators to justice.""Meanwhile, in Kathmandu, the sense of unease is palpable, especially among younger residents. Many say the fear of being linked to the unrest has changed everyday routines. ""Youngsters are now not just hesitant to come out of their homes but have also deleted their social media accounts,"" said Prashant Shrestha, who runs a souvenir shop in Thamel. ""There's fear of being identified for the loot and vandalism that caused so much loss to both public and private property.

'Trump Declared War On Our People': Venezuela Slams Fake Drug Charges After U.S. Strike

Why is Trump eyeing Bagram airbase?







United States president Donald Trump on Thursday said he was working to ""get back"" Bagram airbase, which the United States gave up control of after the 2021 Taliban takeover of Afghanistan.""We're trying to get it back, by the way, that could be a little breaking news. We're trying to get it back because they need things from us. We want that base back,"" Trump said at a press conference with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.Trump claimed his intention to return American forces to Afghanistan’s Bagram Airbase is because “China now controls Bagram.”About a month earlier, Trump had suggested the US might return to Afghanistan, saying, “We are going to keep a small force on Bagram” to counter China’s growing influence.Trump stressed that his focus on Bagram was not about Afghanistan itself.“We wanted to keep this base because of China, not because of Afghanistan,” he said, noting the airbase’s proximity to China’s nuclear facilities, “just an hour” away, as its key strategic value.Bagram Airbase has long been one of the United States’ most important military assets in South Asia, valued for both its location and its capabilities.Located about 40 kilometres north of Kabul, it sits close to the borders of China, Pakistan, Iran, and Central Asia, giving the US a forward-operating hub near some of the world’s most volatile regions.Its proximity to China’s Xinjiang region, where Beijing maintains nuclear and military facilities, made it particularly significant for American strategic planning.During the US presence in Afghanistan, Bagram was the largest American airbase in the country. It had multiple runways capable of handling heavy bombers and transport aircraft, housed thousands of US and Nato troops at its peak, and included extensive infrastructure such as command centers, detention facilities, and logistics hubs. This made it the nerve center of US military operations in Afghanistan for nearly two decades.Beyond Afghanistan, Bagram gave Washington the ability to project power across South and Central Asia, carry out surveillance, support counterterrorism missions, and monitor regional adversaries like China, Russia, Iran, and Pakistan. Symbolically too, the base represented the scale of America’s military footprint in the region.Its abrupt abandonment during the 2021 withdrawal was seen by many analysts as a strategic mistake, as it left the facility open to Taliban control and raised concerns about possible Chinese interest in the site.","US president Donald Trump said he was working to ""get back"" Bagram airbase.

KATHMANDU: On a stroll through Kathmandu’s Thamel district—the beating heart of Nepal’s tourist trade—the presence of China is hard to miss. Shop signs flash Mandarin translations, and even restaurant menus have dish details elaborated in the language. In narrow lanes once dominated almost entirely by Indian backpackers and European trekkers, Chinese tourists now form a noticeable second wave.At Tribhuvan International Airport, the shift has been made official. Alongside a long-standing immigration counter reserved for Indian citizens, a new one has been set up for Chinese travellers, with colourful words saying: 'Celebrating 70 years of Nepal-China friendship'. The gesture complements an existing visa-free regime for Chinese citizens, making their entry smoother than ever in the Himalayan nation.For Mausam Rana, a hotel manager in Thamel, the impact is visible in the guest ledger. “Indians still form the bulk of our clientele,” he said. “But Chinese numbers are rising. Till some time back, our hotel used to have around 15 or 20 Chinese tourists in a month—now it’s double that.With campaigns like 'Visit Nepal' this year and better flight connections, the peak season could bring even more.”Official data seems to confirm what the eye sees. In August, Nepal welcomed 88,680 foreign visitors, a 22 % rise from last year. Indians accounted for 40 %, Chinese 8.5 %, and Americans about 6 %. Himal Gautam, director at department of tourism, Nepal, told TOI, ""In August, a total of 7,533 Chinese tourists visited Nepal in comparison to 6,614 in the same month last year. SImilarly, in May, a total of 8,824 tourists from China visited our country against 8,381 in May last year.Indian tourists have always topped the chart in terms of foreign tourists visiting our country. But we are happy that more tourists are also coming from China and other countries as well.""The new relationship extends beyond tourism. Chinese automakers—BYD, Leap Motors, Omoda, XPENG, Dongfeng Forthing, Great Wall, to name a few, have flooded Kathmandu’s streets with sleek electric vehicles. Taxi driver Sushil Thapa, who has worked the roads for two decades, says Indian cars once ruled. “Now, whole fleets run on Chinese EVs. They’re stylish, affordable, and packed with features.”For Kathmandu-based analysts like Kanchan Jha, the trend is unmistakable. “It reflects a look-beyond-India mindset,” he said. “Our ties with India remain deep, but there is value in cultivating another giant across the mountains.”","In August, Nepal welcomed 88,680 foreign visitors, a 22 % rise from last year.

Nepal’s interim prime minister has announced her first cabinet appointments, in a move to stabilise the country after violent youth-led demonstrations forced the previous government out.At a ceremony held outdoors beside the torched presidential office, President Ram Chandra Paudel swore in three senior ministers on Monday in an event that was carried live on television.Among the new ministers, lawyer Om Prakash Aryal, recognised for his work on corruption, governance and human rights, will lead the home, law, justice and parliamentary affairs portfolio.Kulman Ghising, who is credited for ending years of crippling power cuts as head of the Nepal Electricity Authority, will oversee energy, infrastructure, transport and urban development, reported AFP.The former finance secretary Rameshwor Khanal, a renowned economist, takes charge of the finance ministry, confronting unemployment that affects one in five Nepalis aged 15 to 24.According to World Bank data, the country’s GDP per capita stands at only $1,447. Sushila Karki , 73-year-old former chief justice now serving as prime minister, faces the task of steering the country towards elections in March while addressing calls for clean governance.The crisis began on September 8, when a ban on social media set off mass demonstrations that tapped into years of economic frustration. Crowds torched parliament and other government buildings as anger spread, in scenes not seen since the end of the civil war and abolition of the monarchy in 2008.Government figures put the death toll at 72 over just two days, with another 191 still in hospital, as per an AFP report.Karki’s elevation followed behind-the-scenes talks led by army chief General Ashok Raj Sigdel and President Paudel, who also engaged with “Gen Z” activists. Thousands of young protesters had used Discord to push her candidacy.She admitted on Sunday that she had “not wished” to take the post, but that her “name was brought from the streets”.Karki pledged her administration would work “according to the thinking of the Gen Z generation”, saying young people wanted “the end of corruption, good governance and economic equality”.","Sushila Karki, 73, sworn in as Nepal's interim prime minister on Monday.

The UK has carried out its first deportation under a new returns treaty with France, with home secretary Shabana Mehmood calling it an “important first step” in efforts to curb illegal English Channel crossings.“This is an important first step to securing our borders. It sends a message to people crossing in small boats: if you enter the UK illegally, we will seek to remove you,” Mehmood said Thursday. She added that the government would continue to challenge “last-minute, vexatious” attempts in court, and stressed that Britain would continue to provide refuge through “safe, legal and managed routes — not dangerous crossings. ”According to UK home office sources, the deportee is an Indian national who crossed into Britain illegally on a small boat in August. He was flown on a commercial flight to Paris under the “one-in, one-out” deal signed with France. Once returned, he will be offered a voluntary repatriation scheme to India; refusal would bar him from applying for asylum and could result in enforced removal.The pilot agreement, which began in August and will run until June 2026, allows the UK to deport migrants who arrive illegally while accepting an equal number from France through a new safe and legal asylum pathway, subject to strict eligibility and security checks.The first arrivals under this reciprocal route are expected in Britain in the coming days.Official data show that 2,715 Indian nationals were in UK immigration detention as of August — more than double last year’s figure, an increase of 108 per cent. The deported man is among the first group of migrants held by UK Border Force since the treaty came into force.According to the home office, more than 35,000 people with no right to remain were removed from the UK in the past year, with returns of foreign criminals up 14 per cent and asylum-related removals up 28 per cent.","The deportee is an Indian national who crossed into Britain illegally on a small boat in August.

It was Britain’s oldest political trick—deploying the monarchy as a velvet glove to soften a hard negotiation. The soaring banquet hall, filled with nearly a thousand years of heraldry, wasn’t just a backdrop; it was a stage. Every polished suit of armour and gilded goblet was calculated to make Trump feel not just welcomed, but enthroned.For Britain, the stakes were high. With Trump’s second term already marked by tariffs, transactional diplomacy, and the unraveling of Western alliances, London needed leverage. The royal family, still Britain’s most effective soft power tool, provided it.Unlike the star-studded dinners of yesteryears—think Hollywood names or fashion royalty—this banquet was stocked with people who wield real influence. At the 160-seat table were Wall Street titans like Blackstone’s Stephen Schwarzman and Bank of America’s Brian Moynihan, tech heavyweights like Sam Altman, Demis Hassabis, Satya Nadella, Marc Benioff, and Apple’s Tim Cook, plus media barons like Rupert Murdoch.The symbolism was obvious: Britain wanted Trump to see that its royals could convene a pantheon of the global elite in his honour. The message—this is the club you still belong to, provided you play nice with us.Tim Cook’s presence was particularly striking. Barely weeks ago, he was in Trump’s bad books for skipping a Middle East trip. Yet here he was, seated beside Tiffany Trump, as if the Windsor seating chart itself was an act of reconciliation.King Charles used his toast to strike a balance—lavishing praise on Anglo-American friendship, while inserting subtle nudges about climate and Ukraine. The king knows Trump’s views on both issues are, at best, sceptical. But the gentle prod, wrapped in regal ceremony, seemed unlikely to provoke the famously thin-skinned president.Trump, for his part, basked in the flattery. He declared himself “the first American president welcomed here,” conveniently overlooking his own previous Windsor visit and the fact that past presidents had dined at Buckingham Palace. Accuracy mattered less than optics. In that moment, Trump was both guest and monarch, enjoying the rarest of British honours: being feted in a castle that has survived every empire from the Normans to the Nazis.Trump is not sentimental about monarchy. But he is sentimental about status. For a man who relishes gilded interiors, gold-plated trophies, and long tables of power, Windsor was the ultimate backdrop. Britain knows this. The castle setting was a calculated bet: flatter the president’s sense of grandeur, and he might be more pliable when it comes to trade talks or military cooperation.Downing Street, led by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, clearly coordinated with the palace. By seating Trump amid billionaires, bankers, and AI moguls, Britain showed it could still marshal global capital and innovation in ways that appeal to Trump’s business-first instincts.Yet even amid the choreography, there were hints of tension. Rupert Murdoch, Trump’s once-powerful ally turned legal adversary, was seated far from the president’s line of sight. Months earlier, Murdoch’s Wall Street Journal had broken the story about Trump’s ties to Jeffrey Epstein, leading to lawsuits and public feuds. Still, Murdoch was present—because Britain needed the symbolism of its most famous media mogul under the same roof as its most mercurial guest.This was Windsor diplomacy in miniature: even enemies were summoned, but placed carefully so as not to disrupt the main performance.Outside the castle, the spectacle looked different. Protesters projected Trump’s photos with Epstein onto Windsor’s ancient stone walls. Last week in Washington, diners heckled him as “Hitler” during his first public meal out since re-election. The banquet, then, was a temporary reprieve—a fortress designed to shield Trump from the political storms raging beyond the moat.But no banquet lasts forever. Once Trump leaves the Great Hall’s chandeliers and tapestries, he must return to a world less deferential. Britain, however, bet that the glow of Windsor would linger long enough to influence Thursday’s talks at Downing Street.This isn’t new. Britain has long used its monarchy to oil the gears of diplomacy. From Churchill to Thatcher, British leaders have leveraged royal pageantry to charm, flatter, and occasionally disarm foreign leaders. For Trump, whose worldview is explicitly transactional, the spectacle is a tool of persuasion: Britain offers him honour in exchange for concessions.For Starmer, facing an uphill climb to reset Britain’s global standing post-Brexit, Trump’s goodwill is critical. Tariffs, NATO commitments, and US-UK trade are all on the table. The White House may demand tribute, but Windsor shows Britain still knows how to stage-manage power.The Windsor banquet was more than pomp. It was Britain signalling that, despite diminished economic clout, it retains the ability to convene and charm. The monarchy, carefully modernised but still cloaked in medieval grandeur, remains its most potent weapon of influence.Trump got what he wanted: adulation, status, and the appearance of global centrality. Britain got what it wanted: a chance to soften him up before hard negotiations. Both sides left the castle with something—but whether royal flattery can survive Trump’s tariff hammer is the test that lies ahead.",Donald Trump dined with King Charles III and Queen Camilla at Windsor Castle.

UK King hosts Donald Trump at Windsor for historic state visit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-king-hosts-donald-trump-at-windsor-for-historic-state-visit/articleshow/123954971.cms,"'Not Welcome Here': UK Protesters Confront Trump With Protests In Windsor





LONDON: US President Donald Trump and his wife Melania received the largest ceremonial welcome ever seen for a state visit in living memory on Wednesday at Windsor Castle on their historic second state visit to Britain.Trump is the first US president ever to have a second state visit. Traditionally US presidents just have tea or lunch with the monarch on any subsequent visits to the UK.On Thursday Trump will travel to Chequers where he will meet UK PM Keir Starmer and unlock £31 billion worth of investments from America’s top technology firms, including Microsoft and Google, to boost the UK’s AI infrastructure.The couple spent Tuesday night at the US ambassador’s residence in Regent’s Park where Trump, perhaps suffering from jet lag, posted a flurry of posts on Truth Social until 3.23am UK time, including an article titled “US President Trump dials PM Modi, greets him on birthday”.On Wednesday they flew by Marine One to Windsor Castle and were taken in a horse-drawn procession, together with the King and Queen and William and Kate, through the estate. They watched military parades and Trump inspected the exceptionally large guard of honour.Lt Col Storm Green, captain of the guard of honour, said: “It is the first time we have got all three state colours out — the Grenadier Guards, Coldstream Guards and Scots Guards — for a foreign head of state.It’s the biggest one I have done in my 28-year career.”For Starmer, the visit serves as a welcome distraction to the problems he is facing domestically.After lunch, they viewed the Royal Collection where Trump took a particular interest in a document indicating when George III realised America was no longer under his control.They laid a wreath on the tomb of the late Queen Elizabeth II at St George’s Chapel. After that there was due to be a flypast by the Red Arrows alongside British and American F-35 jets, followed by a glittering white-tie banquet.The entire day took place within the walls of Windsor Castle. Meanwhile “Stop Trump” demonstrators gathered in London and the Guardian ran an article by London mayor Sadiq Khan slamming Trump.Four men were arrested on Tuesday night after projecting a giant image of Trump and the late child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein onto the exterior walls of Windsor Castle. Police swiftly stopped the projection. The men remain in police custody. Trump has never been officially accused of wrongdoing in connection with Epstein, with whom he was friends earlier in life. On Wednesday, a van could be seen in Windsor displaying a large image on one side of Trump and Epstein with the message: ""Welcome to the UK, Donald. ""A Thames Valley Police spokesperson told TOI: “The driver was at risk of breaching the Road Traffic Regulations Act, and after a brief conversation with officers the motorist left the area. No arrests were made.”",US President Donald Trump and his wife Melania received the largest ceremonial welcome ever seen for a state visit in living memory.

Who was Marissa Laimou?







A 28-year-old Greek heiress, Marissa Laimou, a cancer survivor, was found dead in her London flat on September 11. Her family revealed that she was displaying symptoms like dizziness, fever, infections and visited a hospital that turned her away and claimed that she was bitten by an insect.A doctor visited her home and prescribed paracetamol initially, but as her situation did not improve, she was sent to see an oncologist at a hospital. From there she was rushed to another unit but her family claimed that - after being seen by nurses instead of a doctor at the second hospital - she was sent home. Laimou was discharged and handed antibiotics and a diagnosis that referred to an insect bite. But the next day, she was dead.“She was bitten by an insect, she was itchy, she went to the doctor, she took antibiotics, she ate, she slept and she never woke up. My daughter was saved from cancer. My little child,” her mother said, as quoted by the Independent. “She was a girl with so many gifts. All of England is crying, all her doctors too,” she added.The hospital from which Laimou was sent home has reportedly opened an internal investigation over the incident.Meanwhile, a post-mortem is due to be carried out in the coming days.“The entire family is shocked by the sudden death of the daughter of Diamantis and Bessie Laimou. She was a very kind girl, quiet, educated, cultured, modest and simple. She loved art and theatre, she was involved in theatre. Warm condolences to the family! Strength and courage!"" Marissa's great-aunt Chrysanthi said.Daughter of Diamantis and Bessue Laimou, Marissa was part of a wealthy Greek shipping family. She recently survived breast cancer and was working in fashion, business and theatre. She worked in Paris with fashion designers including Sonia Rykiel and John Galliano. Later, she founded Rainbow Wave, a company through which she introduced international brands to UK/London retailers. She was involved in theatre production in London; one recent production was Romeo and Juliet, and she was preparing more theatrical work before her death.","Marissa Laimou, 28, was found dead in her London flat on September 11.

Protesters wave Union Jack and St George's England flags during the ""Unite The Kingdom"" rally on Westminster Bridge by the Houses of Parliament on September 13.





Hindus in the UK were placed in the spotlight at a massive rally in London on September 13, where far-right activist Tommy Robinson, known for his harsh criticism of Muslims, described Indians, particularly Hindus, as a ""peaceful, peace-loving migrant community"".The remarks come weeks before Diwali, when Leicester’s celebrations, once the largest outside India, are being significantly scaled back. Labour-run Leicester City Council has cancelled all public festivities apart from lighting up Diwali lanterns on lampposts and closing Belgrave Road on October 20. A safety advisory group cited public safety concerns after last year’s celebrations attracted a record 55,000 people.The contrast is striking. While Leicester’s Hindu community sees its biggest cultural showcase trimmed down to LED lights and a Ferris wheel, Robinson has positioned himself as a vocal defender of Hindus, especially in the wake of the 2022 Leicester unrest and the grooming gang scandals that have strained community relations.Following the Leicester clashes, Robinson vowed to protect British Hindus, even offering to mobilise “hundreds of men” to support them, as he told a right-wing Indian news outlet.His narrative has since amplified themes of Hindu victimhood, including claims of “a genocide on Hindus” in Bangladesh after the fall of Sheikh Hasina’s government, though videos he circulated at the time were later proven fake.In May, a police intelligence report cited by the Daily Mail noted growing links between far-right groups and Hindu extremists in Britain, rooted in a “shared hatred of Muslims”. The report, prepared by the National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC), said Robinson had engaged with Hindu organisations to push “anti-Muslim campaigns” and that “his presence seemed to be welcomed by the Indian media and a minority of British Hindus”.The NPCC stressed that moderate Hindus had strongly denounced any alliance between Hindutva supporters and white supremacists.Robinson, 42, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, remains a divisive figure in the British right. He founded the English Defence League, notorious for violent street protests in the 2000s and 2010s, and has served multiple prison terms. His most recent conviction came in 2024, when he was sentenced to 18 months for defying a court order in a libel case involving a Syrian refugee.","Far-right activist Tommy Robinson described Indians, particularly Hindus, as a ""peaceful, peace-loving migrant community"" Remarks come weeks before Diwali, when Leicester’s celebrations, once the largest outside India, are being significantly scaled back.

An Indian-origin heart surgeon, Amal Bose, 55, has been sentenced to six years in jail in the UK for abusing his position to sexually assault female colleagues at Blackpool Hospital in Lancaster. But Bose told the police when they arrested him that ""it was only flirting"".The incidents took place between 2017 and 2022. when he had headed the hospital's cardiovascular surgery department. One woman told the court that Bose's behavior was a well-known fact and newcomers used to be advised on how to deal with him.Bose regularly commented on women's appearances and called them 'fresh meat' on a WhatsApp group.One of Bose's victims told the court she was groped by the surgeon as she scrubbed up ahead of surgery. On another occasion, shortly after she joined the department, Bose rested his head on her shoulder. Another victim was groped in an operating theatre as she helped the consultant prepare for an operation. After putting his gloves on, Bose 'purposefully' grabbed her breast, the court heard.One woman said Bose groped her breast as he helped himself to a pen from her top pocket.One said she was touched inappropriately every time she saw him and that used to leave her frightened and anxious, forcing her to change her working time to avoid him.Defending Bose, Tom Price KC said he realised that Bose had put his victims through the ordeal of a trial but that his client had only fully realised their true hurt in court. The court was informed that Bose was a highly skilled surgeon but lost his job in the wake of the complaints and was now working as a parcel deliveryman.Judge Unsworth acknowledged that Bose was a highly skilled surgeon who had been held in high regard by his colleagues. But he said this simply served to make his offending ""all the more tragic"".","Amal Bose, 55, has been sentenced to six years in jail in the UK for abusing his position to sexually assault female colleagues at Blackpool Hospital.

NAIROBI: A Nairobi court issued an arrest warrant Tuesday for a British citizen in connection with the high-profile death of a young Kenyan mother whose body was found in a septic tank over a decade ago.Agnes Wanjiru, 21, died in 2012 after she reportedly went partying with British soldiers at a hotel in central Nanyuki town, where Britain has a permanent army garrison.The Office for the Director of Public Prosecutions (ODPP) said it had informed the court ""that evidence gathered links the suspect, a United Kingdom citizen, to the murder"".Nairobi High Court judge Alexander Muteti said there was ""probable cause to order the arrest of the accused and his surrender before this court for his trial"", granting a warrant for ""one citizen and resident of the United Kingdom"".Following the judge's ruling, the ODPP said in a statement on X that ""extradition proceedings would now be initiated to ensure the suspect is brought before a Kenyan court"".Wanjiru's sister, Rose Wanyua Wanjiku, 52, welcomed the announcement and told AFP: ""Let justice prevail"".""As a family we are very happy because it has been many years but now we can see a step has been made,"" she said.- 'Accelerate progress' -A spokesperson for the British government acknowledged the DPP had ""determined that a British National should face trial in relation to the murder of Ms Wanjiru in 2012"".The government remains ""absolutely committed to helping them secure justice"", but will not comment further due to legal proceedings, according to a statement.In October 2021, The Sunday Times reported that a soldier had confessed to his comrades to killing Wanjiru and showed them her body.The report alleged that the murder was taken to military superiors, but there was no further action.A Kenyan investigation was opened in 2019 but no results have been disclosed.

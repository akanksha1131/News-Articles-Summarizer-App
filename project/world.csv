Hundreds gathered at a New York mosque on Thursday to commemorate a Bangladesh-born police officer who lost his life protecting his adopted city when a shooter attacked an office building this week.Officer Didarul Islam ""did believe in the American dream, not as something handed down but as something built with your own hands,"" Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch addressed Islam's community as officers stood in formation outside the Bronx religious centre.Officials and New York's Bangladeshi community members gathered to honour the deceased officer during a service that highlighted his dedication to family, heritage and public service.The 36-year-old officer, a married father of two expecting a third child, was conducting an NYPD-approved private security assignment in uniform when he and three others were fatally shot Monday at the Manhattan high-rise housing the NFL's headquarters and various corporate offices.""To our family, he was our world. To the city, he was a proud NYPD officer who served with compassion and integrity. He lived to help others,"" Islam's widow said in a message delivered by a family member at the Parkchester Jame Masjid mosque, according to the Associated Press.Officers positioned on nearby rooftops provided security whilst fire engines displayed a large American flag across the street. A vehicle carried a digital display showing Islam's photographs and a tribute from his union.After immigrating to the United States, Islam established his career in America's largest police department. He viewed policing as ""a blanket of the community, there to provide comfort and care,"" according to the police commissioner.Initially serving as a school safety agent, Islam became a patrol officer less than four years ago and received a posthumous promotion to detective on Thursday.""He could have gone into any other occupation he wanted, but he wanted to put on that uniform, and he wanted to protect fellow New Yorkers. And he wanted to let us know that he believed in what this city and what this country stood for,"" Mayor Eric Adams told attendees.In Washington, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt commenced her briefing by conveying President Donald Trump's sympathies to Islam's family, noting he ""made the ultimate sacrifice in defence of his fellow New Yorkers.""Imam Zakir Ahmed emphasised the officer's immigrant background and Muslim faith, whilst noting Islam ""lived at a time when people like him are too often feared, vilified and made to feel like outsiders.""Following the service, attendees filled the streets for prayer, including Muslim officers, as their colleagues maintained formation behind them.The officer's casket, adorned with US and NYPD flags, was transported to Totowa, New Jersey, for burial.Julia Hyman, 27, another victim who worked at a real estate firm, was remembered at a Manhattan synagogue service on Wednesday.Funeral arrangements remain unannounced for security guard Aland Etienne and executive Wesley LePatner.Police identified Shane Tamura, 27, as the assailant, a former football player who recently worked in Las Vegas casino surveillance. Authorities discovered over 800 ammunition rounds in his vehicle and 47 shell casings at the scene.Officials reported Tamura had mental health issues and found prescribed psychiatric medication at his Las Vegas residence. He mistakenly accessed the wrong floor whilst attempting to reach the NFL office. The shooting seriously wounded an NFL employee in the lobby.Governor Kathy Hochul stated at Thursday's service that Islam ""saved lives. He was out front,"" adding that ""others may be alive today because he was the barrier.""","Officer Didarul Islam, 36, was one of four people killed in the New York office shooting.

A disturbing attempted child abduction at a Virginia shopping centre was foiled by a mother who spotted a man carrying away her 3-year-old daughter.The suspect, 26-year-old Andres Caceres Jaldin, has a history of violence and had previously been diagnosed with schizophrenia, according to court records cited by the New York Post.The incident unfolded on July 18, at the Fair Oaks Shopping Center in Fairfax County. Surveillance footage released by the county sheriff’s office show Jaldin lifting the toddler into his arms and walking away after she strayed from an indoor play area.The girl’s father, who had been watching her, immediately phoned his wife, who was nearby shopping at a JCPenney. She quickly located Jaldin with their daughter on the second floor and confronted him.Jaldin handed over the child without resistance and claimed he was simply trying to help the girl find her parents, according to the criminal complaint. He then fled the mall in a vehicle that had been reported stolen from a nearby auto shop just prior to the incident.Police later tracked the car to a hotel in Chantilly, where Jaldin was arrested.Court documents show Jaldin has a violent past, including several assault charges involving his own family.In 2024, he was charged with assault and battery, malicious wounding, and property damage, with his mother, father and brother listed as victims.Despite being out on bail, he was accused of assaulting his family again. A psychiatric evaluation during the legal proceedings diagnosed him with schizophrenia. All charges related to the family incidents were eventually dropped.Jaldin now faces charges of abduction of a minor and grand larceny. He is being held without bond at the Fairfax County Adult Detention Center.","Andres Caceres Jaldin, 26, has a history of violence and had previously been diagnosed with schizophrenia.

Donald Trump's crackdown at pharma: 'Americans need lower drug prices'; sets 29 September deadline or face action,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/donald-trumps-crackdown-at-pharma-americans-need-lower-drug-prices-sets-29-september-deadline-or-face-action/articleshow/123032580.cms,"Extend most-favored-nation (MFN) pricing to Medicaid: Offer the full portfolio of existing drugs at MFN rates to all Medicaid patients.



Guarantee MFN pricing for newly launched drugs: Ensure MFN pricing applies to Medicare, Medicaid and commercial payers for all new drugs at launch and beyond.



Return increased revenues from abroad to American patients and taxpayers: Trump said domestic MFN pricing should push drug makers to negotiate tougher deals with foreign buyers, and the extra revenue must be used to lower domestic costs.



Enable direct purchasing at MFN pricing: Adopt direct-to-consumer and direct-to-business distribution for widely used prescription drugs, allowing Americans access to the same low prices typically reserved for third-party payers.



US President Donald Trump issued a sharp warning to pharmaceutical giants, calling on them to slash prescription drug prices in the United States or face the consequences.In letters addressed to 17 major drug companies, Trump urged them to cooperate with his administration to implement sweeping reforms aimed at lowering costs for American patients, who currently pay some of the highest drug prices in the developed world.These firms are Eli Lilly and Company, Sanofi, Regeneron Pharma, Merek, GSK, Johnson & Johnson, Genentech, Amgen, AstraZeneca, Novo Nordisk, Pfizer, EMD Serono, Gilead Sciences, Novartis, Bristol Myers Squibb, Boehringer Ingelheim, AbbVie.“If you refuse to step up we will deploy every tool in our arsenal to protect American families from continued abusive drug pricing practices,” Trump wrote in the letters, which were published on his platform, Truth Social.The push follows an executive order Trump signed on May 12, 2025, titled Delivering Most-Favored-Nation Prescription Drug Pricing to American Patients. The order is designed to end what Trump called “global freeloading” by foreign governments benefiting from lower prices on American-developed medicines.According to the White House, drug prices in the US are on average up to three times higher than in other developed countries for the same medications.Trump has blamed this on “an unacceptable burden on hardworking American families” and vowed to put a stop to it.In the letters, Trump said that most proposals his administration had received from the pharmaceutical industry offered “more of the same: shifting blame and requesting policy changes that would result in billions of dollars in handouts to industry.”Instead, he laid out a clear list of demands to be fulfilled within 60 days:“My team, including secretary Kennedy and Administrator Oz, stand ready to implement these terms,” Trump said. “I expect you to further engage with them immediately, in good faith, to deliver relief for American families.”The US President highlighted achieving global price parity would be the most effective outcome for all stakeholders, but he warned that failure to comply would prompt government action.“Americans are demanding lower drug prices and they need them today,” he added. “Other nations have been freeloading on US innovation for far too long; it is time they pay their fair share.”He concluded the letter by asking for binding commitments by September 29, and promised support for implementation queries.The move marks one of Trump’s most aggressive attempts to tackle the long-standing issue of inflated prescription drug prices in the United States.","US President Donald Trump issued a sharp warning to pharmaceutical giants, calling on them to slash prescription drug prices in the United States.

Trade war: ‘Major success’ or ‘factless turbulence’? Here's how nations reacted to Trump's new tariffs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trade-war-major-success-or-factless-turbulence-heres-how-nations-reacted-to-trumps-new-tariffs/articleshow/123032871.cms,"Canada slams tariffs as ‘tact-less turbulence’

A 'major success' for Thailand

Cambodia gets 'the best news'

Taiwan hopes for more cuts

A sweeping new wave of tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump has triggered a flurry of responses from trading partners around the globe.Thursday’s announcement unveiled new or sharply increased tariffs on dozens of countries, with rates ranging from a baseline tariff of 10% to as high as 41%. The sweeping move has prompted a wide range of responses, as each nation scrambles to protect its economic interests.The newly announced tariffs would be taking place from August 7.Here's how some have responded:Canada sharply criticised the US move to hike tariffs from 25% to 35%. The decision, laid out in a White House fact sheet citing “Canada’s continued inaction and retaliation,” will take effect from August 1, CNN reported.Candace Laing, President and CEO of Canada’s Chamber of Commerce, launched a sharp attack on increased tariffs.“The White House fact sheet should be called a fact-less sheet when it comes to basing trade decisions about Canada on the fentanyl emergency,” she said.“More fact-less tariff turbulence does not advance North American economic security. Businesses — in Canada and the US— urgently need certainty.”Laing further praised Canadian PM Mark Carney for refusing to be rushed into a deal, calling his approach “strong” and “future-focused.”Thailand described the outcome of its talks with Washington as a diplomatic victory, welcoming a 19% tariff rate instead of the originally threatened 36%.“This finalised deal, setting US import tariffs at 19%, marks a major success for Thailand,” government spokesman Jirayu Huangsab said in a statement.“It represents a win-win approach aimed at preserving Thailand's export base and long-term economic stability.”The US goods trade deficit with Thailand rose to $45.6 billion in 2024, up 11.7% from the previous year. The southeast Asian nation has faced economic headwinds since the pandemic and recently downgraded its 2025 growth forecast to between 2.3% and 3.3%.The tariff deal came on the heels of Trump’s diplomatic involvement in brokering a ceasefire between Thailand and Cambodia after five days of border clashes that killed over 40 people and displaced 300,000.Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet welcomed the 19% tariff deal with the US, which averted the harsher 36% levy initially planned.“This is the best news for the people and economy of Cambodia to continue to develop the country,” he wrote on Facebook.The development follows days of deadly border conflict with Thailand, which was halted after US diplomatic intervention earlier in the week.Taiwan vowed to continue negotiations with Washington after Trump imposed a ""temporary"" 20% levy on its exports, which could have been as high as 32%.""The US has announced a temporary 20% tariff for Taiwan, with the possibility of further reductions should an agreement be reached,"" President Lai Ching-te said on Facebook.""The government will continue to strive for a reasonable tariff rate and complete the final stages of the tariff negotiations.""Semiconductor powerhouse Taiwan has seen soaring demand for its AI-related chips, which make up the bulk of its trade surplus with the US. Nearly 60% of its exports to the US are information and communications technology products.In an effort to soften the blow, Taipei pledged increased investment in the US, more energy imports from American producers, and higher defence spending.Taiwan’s Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim emphasised the mutual value in maintaining strong US-Taiwan trade relations.“The United States is indeed a very important trade partner for Taiwan,” Hsiao said.America also needs Taiwan in supporting resilient supply chains, in supporting manufacturing and some high-end technologies.More countries, like Syria, Switzerland, Laos are expected to respond as the new deadline of August 7 looms.","US announces new or sharply increased tariffs on dozens of countries, with rates ranging from a baseline tariff of 10% to as high as 41%.

Tampa Bay Buccaneers player Desmond Watson is in a very challenging position due to his weight. Here, July 2025, the team's training camp is already well under way in Tampa, Florida. At around 450 pounds, Desmond Watson is still not allowed to participate in team activities. You can almost feel how much he wants to play as he walks laps under the hot sun.

No tents this time: Trump to build $200 million Ballroom in White House for large gatherings; see pics,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/no-tents-this-time-trump-to-build-200-million-ballroom-in-white-house-for-large-gatherings-see-pics/articleshow/123034907.cms,".





The White House said Thursday that work on a huge new ballroom, costing $200 million, will start in September and be completed by the conclusion of President Donald Trump's term in early 2029.It will be the most recent modification made to ""The People's House"" since the Republican president took office again in January. Additionally, it would mark the first structural alteration to the Executive Mansion since the Truman balcony was added in 1948.In addition to installing enormous flagpoles on the north and south lawns to fly the American flag, Trump has redecorated the Oval Office with cherubs and golden flourishes, as well as presidential portraits. A project to replace the Rose Garden's lawn with stone is presently being completed.For months, Trump has been promising to construct a ballroom, claiming that the White House lacks the space necessary for large gatherings and mocking the idea of holding state dinners with hundreds of guests in tents on the lawn, as previous administrations have done.About 200 people can be accommodated in the White House's largest room, the East space.“They’ve wanted a ballroom at the White House for more than 150 years but there’s never been a president that was good at ballrooms,” Trump told reporters Thursday. “I'm good at building things and we’re going to build quickly and on time. It’ll be beautiful, top, top of the line.”The 90,000-square-foot ballroom will be built where the East Wing sits with a seated capacity of 650 people. The East Wing houses several offices, including the first lady’s. Those offices will be temporarily relocated during construction and that wing of the building will be modernized and renovated, said White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.“Nothing will be torn down,” she said.Leavitt said at her briefing Thursday that Trump and other donors have committed to raising the approximately $200 million in construction costs. She did not name any of the other donors.Renderings of the look of future ballroom were posted on the White House website.Trump is also working on another project. In an interview with NBC News, he stated that he plans to replace the infamous Lincoln Bedroom's ""terribly"" renovated bathroom with one that is more in keeping with 19th-century design.","The 90,000-square-foot ballroom will be built where the East Wing sits with a seated capacity of 650 people.

'Nobel For Trump': Karoline Makes Big Announcement; 'From Israel-Iran To India-Pak, U.S...'

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Thursday reasserted that US President Donald Trump has facilitated numerous peace agreements and ceasefires globally and emphasised that these diplomatic achievements, occurring approximately monthly, warrant his nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize.Addressing the Thailand-Cambodia situation, Leavitt stated, ""On the peace front, President Trump helped deliver an immediate and unconditional ceasefire between Thailand and Cambodia. The two countries were engaged in a deadly conflict that had displaced more than 300,000 people until President Trump stepped in to put an end to it.""""President Trump has brokered on average about one peace deal or ceasefire per month during his six months in office. It’s well past time that President Trump was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize,"" she added.According to CNN, Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who currently chairs ASEAN, announced the ceasefire agreement after facilitating discussions between Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet and acting Thai Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai near Kuala Lumpur.She said that the US President's direct communication with both prime ministers included a clear message that trade discussions would cease unless the conflict ended.This resulted in swift peace negotiations, preserving numerous lives and enabling trade talks to continue.Leavitt outlined Trump's involvement in resolving conflicts between various nations, including Israel-Iran, Rwanda-DRC, India-Pakistan, Serbia-Kosovo, and Egypt-Ethiopia. She highlighted that these achievements averaged one diplomatic success monthly during his six-month tenure.Regarding India-Pakistan relations, Trump has repeatedly claimed credit for de-escalating tensions following India's response to Pakistani aggression. However, India maintained its stance that matters concerning Jammu and Kashmir remain bilateral.Recently, Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the Operation Sindoor discussion in Lok Sabha, stating, ""No leader in the world told India to stop its operation. On the night of 9th May, the Vice President of America tried to talk to me. He tried for an hour, but I was in a meeting with my army, so I could not pick up his call. Later, I called him back. The Vice President of America told me on the phone that Pakistan is going to launch a big attack. My answer was that if Pakistan has this intention, it will cost them a lot. If Pakistan attacks, we will respond by launching a big attack. This was my answer...""Operation Sindoor commenced on May 7, targeting terror infrastructure in Pakistan and PoJK following the Pahalgam attack that claimed 26 civilian lives.

'MORAL DISTORTION'





The U.S. imposed sanctions on Palestinian Authority officials and members of the Palestine Liberation Organization on Thursday, accusing them of undermining peace efforts with Israel even as other Western powers moved toward recognition of Palestinian statehood.The State Department said it would deny visas for travel to the U.S. by those it was targeting, although it did not name any specific individuals.""It is in our national security interests to impose consequences and hold the PLO and PA accountable for not complying with their commitments and undermining the prospects for peace,"" the State Department said in a statement.The State Department said the two Palestinian organizations had ""taken actions to internationalize"" their conflict with Israel, including through the International Criminal Court, and said both had continued ""to support terrorism.""The PA and PLO serve as representatives for the Palestinian people and have long pushed for recognition of a Palestinian state by international organizations and foreign nations. The two groups had no immediate comment on the U.S. move.There are signs of a growing diplomatic divide over Palestinian statehood between Washington and three fellow Group of Seven allies.Late on Wednesday, Canada said it planned to recognize the State of Palestine at a meeting of the United Nations in September, ratcheting up pressure on Israel as starvation spreads in the Palestinian enclave of Gaza France said last week it would back Palestinian statehood and Britain said on Tuesday it would do the same at September's U.N. General Assembly meeting if the fighting in Gaza had not stopped by then.U.S. President Donald Trump has insisted that recognition of Palestinian statehood would wrongly reward Hamas, the militant group that is battling Israel in the Gaza Strip. Since returning to office in January, he has been vague about his position on a two-state solution to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.Israel has denounced the moves by France, Britain and Canada.Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar, in a post on X, thanked the U.S. for its ""moral clarity"" in sanctioning the Palestinian officials, saying the action ""also exposes the moral distortion of certain countries that ran to recognise a virtual Palestinian state while turning a blind eye to its support for terror and incitement.""State Department deputy spokesperson Tommy Pigott declined to say whether Thursday's U.S. action was linked to or in retaliation for the three countries' plans to recognize the State of Palestine.Asked about the timing, he told a regular media briefing that the sanctions resulted from a report to Congress from a twice-a-year review of Palestinian compliance with their commitments.It was not immediately clear how the U.S. visa ban would affect Palestinian diplomats.Under the 1947 U.N. ""headquarters agreement,"" the U.S. is generally required to allow access for foreign diplomats to the U.N. in New York. But Washington has said it can deny visas for security, terrorism and foreign policy reasons.Pigott said waivers of the visa sanctions could be considered on a case-by-case basis.The U.S. sanctions follow an international conference this week at the U.N., hosted by France and Saudi Arabia, that aimed to work towards a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians. Israel and the U.S. boycotted the event.Also on Thursday, U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a bid to salvage Gaza truce talks and tackle a humanitarian crisis in the enclave, where a global hunger monitor has warned that famine is unfolding.The Gaza war began on October 7, 2023, when Hamas-led fighters stormed southern Israel, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 251 hostages back to Gaza, according to Israeli tallies.Since then, Israel's offensive has killed more than 60,000 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to Gaza health officials, reduced much of the enclave to ruins and displaced nearly the entire population.","U.S. imposes sanctions on Palestinian Authority officials and members of the Palestine Liberation Organization.

U.S. President Donald Trump has made clear that he wants a deal to end Russia’s war in Ukraine by August 8, the United States told the United Nations Security Council on Thursday.“Both Russia and Ukraine must negotiate a ceasefire and durable peace. It is time to make a deal. President Trump has made clear this must be done by August 8. The United States is prepared to implement additional measures to secure peace,” senior U.S. diplomat John Kelley told the 15-member council.Trump said on Tuesday that the United States would start imposing tariffs and other measures on Russia ""10 days from today"" if Moscow showed no progress toward ending its war in Ukraine.Kyiv and Moscow have held three rounds of talks in Istanbul this year that yielded exchanges of prisoners and bodies, but no breakthrough to defuse the more than three-year conflict.""We intend to continue the negotiations in Istanbul,"" Russia’s deputy U.N. Ambassador Dmitry Polyanskiy told the council, but he added: “Despite the meetings in Istanbul, in the West, the war party did not go away ... We continue hearing voices of those who think that diplomacy is just a way of criticizing Russia and exerting pressure on it.""Ukraine’s deputy U.N. Ambassador Khrystyna Hayovyshyn said Russia must be confronted with ""unity, resolve and action.""""We seek a comprehensive, just and lasting peace grounded in the principles of the U.N. Charter and nothing less. We repeat - a full, immediate and unconditional ceasefire is essential.

"Trump tells Russian official to 'watch his words,' but he bites back instead",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-tells-russian-official-to-watch-his-words-but-he-bites-back-instead/articleshow/123031674.cms,"Donald Trump (AP file photo)





In a midnight social media post, President Donald Trump called Dmitry Medvedev a ""failed former President of Russia"" who had better ""watch his words.""Less than three hours later -- morning by then in Moscow -- Medvedev responded. He said Trump should picture the apocalyptic television series ""The Walking Dead"" and referred to the Soviet Union's system for launching a last-ditch, automatic nuclear strike.""Russia is right about everything and will continue to go its own way,"" said Medvedev's post on the Telegram messaging app.It was the second time this summer that Trump and Medvedev, Russia's head of state from 2008 to 2012, traded blows on social media.The exchanges have been striking not only for the verbal brinkmanship on display between the world's nuclear superpowers, but also for the mismatched stature of the figures involved. While Trump commands the world's most powerful military, Medvedev is widely seen as a social-media attack dog relegated to the periphery of President Vladimir Putin's inner circle.The viciousness of the overnight exchange highlighted the volatility and opacity of a geopolitical relationship in which Trump and Putin set policy largely on their own.And it put on display the combustible mix that can occur when the Kremlin's long-standing willingness to use nuclear threats meets Trump's penchant for late-night diatribes on the internet. Hanging in the balance is the future of Ukraine, three years into Russia's full-scale invasion.""In wars, traditionally diplomatic messaging is something that's done with a lot of care and discipline,"" said Michael Kimmage, a professor at Catholic University in Washington who specializes in the U.S.-Russia relationship. ""The consequences of screwing up can be so huge.""Grigorii Golosov, a professor of political science at the European University in St. Petersburg, Russia, said there was something symbiotic about Trump and Medvedev fighting on social media. Medvedev, who had styled himself as a pro-Western liberal when he served as president more than a decade ago, has recast himself as an uncompromising soldier in Russia's showdown with the West.But attacking Medvedev may also be useful to Trump, Golosov posited, by allowing him to show he's getting tough on Russia without attacking Putin directly. In June, Trump attacked Medvedev for saying countries could send nuclear warheads to Iran, adding: ""I guess that's why Putin's 'THE BOSS.'""This article originally appeared in The New York Times.","Donald Trump called Dmitry Medvedev a ""failed former President of Russia"" less than three hours later.

The White House announced Thursday that it will begin the construction of the “White House State Ballroom,” a major new addition to the presidential complex aimed at addressing long-standing space limitations for official events.The $200 million project, funded by US President Donald Trump and private donors, is set to begin in September and will be built on the site of the current East Wing—a structure originally constructed in 1902 and later modified.Spanning approximately 90,000 square feet, the ballroom will seat up to 650 guests, more than triple the capacity of the current East Room.Construction is expected to be completed before the end of Trump’s current term.""For 150 years, Presidents, Administrations, and White House Staff have longed for a large event space on the White House complex that can hold substantially more guests than currently allowed,” the White House said in a statement.“President Donald J Trump has expressed his commitment to solving this problem on behalf of future Administrations and the American people.""Currently, major functions are hosted under temporary tents set up about 100 yards from the main building.The new permanent structure will eliminate the need for such installations while maintaining architectural consistency with the historic residence.""The White House is one of the most beautiful and historic buildings in the world, yet the White House is currently unable to host major functions honouring world leaders and other countries without having to install a large and unsightly tent approximately 100 yards away from the main building entrance"", the statement said.""The White House Ballroom will be substantially separated from the main building of the White House, but at the same time, it's theme and architectural heritage will be almost identical,” it added.Trump has held meetings with officials from the White House staff, national park service, White House military office, and the US secret service to finalise the design and planning. The US secret service will provide security enhancements.The project will be led by McCrery Architects, a Washington-based firm known for its classical design work. “I am honoured that President Trump has entrusted me to help bring this beautiful and necessary renovation to The People’s House,” said CEO Jim McCrery.

ISLAMABAD: At least 293 people have died and over 600 have been injured across Pakistan since late June as glacial lake outbursts, cloudbursts, and relentless monsoon rains triggered catastrophic floods across the country, from the Himalayas to the southern plains.The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has warned of another severe monsoon spell starting July 29, raising fears of fresh flash floods and landslides, especially in northern regions like Swat, Chitral, Gilgit-Baltistan, and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.Torrential rains have wreaked havoc across the country, sweeping away entire families, burying homes under landslides, and cutting off remote valleys. A sudden cloudburst near Babusar Top and Naran stranded scores of tourists, prompting military-led rescue operations by air and road. Washed-away bridges and blocked highways have hampered relief efforts.The NDMA, provincial agencies, and army teams are on the ground, but operations remain slow and patchy, especially in the hard-to-reach northern areas. Helicopter sorties continue, though poor weather and visibility are disrupting missions.Experts blame successive govts for ignoring climate adaptation and disaster preparedness, despite warnings. “The pattern is repeating itself — glacial melts, erratic monsoons, unprepared institutions. It’s a deadly mix,” said a disaster risk analyst in Islamabad.The crisis echoes the devastating 2022 monsoon floods, which killed over 1,700, submerged a third of the country, and displaced over 30 million people, causing $30 billion in economic losses. Yet, activists say climate resilience remains absent from Pakistan’s national priorities.With more glaciers than any non-polar country, Pakistan faces an increasing frequency of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) due to rising temperatures. Add to that deforestation, poor drainage, and unregulated construction, and experts say even routine monsoons now turn deadly.As another deluge looms, govt has advised evacuations from high-risk zones and warned tourists to stay away from northern areas. But for many already stranded, the warnings have come too late.","At least 293 people have died and over 600 have been injured across Pakistan since late June.

Three Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militants were killed in an encounter with Pakistani security forces in Karachi, officials confirmed on Monday.Among those killed was Zafran, who was identified as the mastermind of a November 2024 attack on two Chinese engineers in Pakistan's largest city. He carried a bounty of Rs 20 million.The operation was conducted late Sunday night in the Manghopir area by the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) and intelligence agencies, CTD official Raja Umer Khattab told. The TTP men opened fire when they saw security personnel approaching, triggering a firefight which lasted over an hour.Authorities recovered a suicide jacket, three grenades, a Kalashnikov rifle, two pistols, and a large quantity of ammunition from the site.On November 5 last year, a private security guard opened fire on two Chinese nationals at a textile mill in Karachi, injuring both before fleeing.Pakistan has witnessed a sharp increase in militant attacks—particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan—since the TTP ended its ceasefire with the federal government in late 2022.Founded in 2007, the TTP is an umbrella organisation of various extremist groups seeking to impose a strict version of Islamic law across Pakistan. It has claimed responsibility for numerous high-profile attacks, including the 2008 Marriott Hotel bombing in Islamabad, the 2009 assault on army headquarters, and multiple strikes on security installations.","Three Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militants were killed in an encounter with Pakistani security forces in Karachi.

Pakistan tribal council threatens highway block over girl’s murder,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-tribal-council-threatens-highway-block-over-girls-murder/articleshow/122939897.cms,"



ISLAMABAD: A tribal jirga (council of elders) in Pakistan’s Tank district has threatened to block a stretch of Indus Highway on July 29 after the killing of a nine-year-old girl sparked public outrage. Convened in Tank’s Gul Imam on Saturday, the jirga issued an 11-point charter of demands, warning of a full blockade if authorities fail to respond.Indus Highway (N-55) is a critical national artery that runs along the river, connecting Karachi in Pakistan’s south with Peshawar in the north and cutting through multiple provinces. The planned blockade at Pezu will impact trade routes, passenger transport, and military convoys.The protests gained momentum after a viral video showed residents confronting armed security personnel -- an extraordinary act in this militarised stretch of southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The footage amplified long-standing anger over arbitrary detentions, raids without warrants, and what locals call collective punishment disguised as counterterrorism.“Our decision to block the highway remains. If our demands are accepted, we’ll reconsider.If not, Pezu will be shut down on July 29,” jirga leader Abdul Qayum Kundi said.Police have registered a case in the girl’s death, but authorities have yet to disclose any findings. Locals allege misconduct or negligence by security forces—claims that remain unverified but widely believed within the community.In a bid to defuse tensions, local officials delivered three sheep and (Pak) Rs 2.5 million (around $9,000) to the girl’s family -- an act rooted in tribal custom, meant to symbolise remorse and reconciliation. But jirga members view it as a token gesture. “This is hush money in ceremonial form,” said one elder.The jirga’s demands include the release of detainees not proven to have militant ties, an end to forced house searches, and a halt to arrests of suspects’ relatives. They also call for the return of confiscated weapons and an end to detentions based on vague accusations of mukhbiri (spying).The jirga’s demands echo those of the banned Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement (PTM), which for years challenged Pakistan’s security policies in its tribal belt.","A tribal jirga in Pakistan’s Tank district has threatened to block a stretch of Indus Highway.

‘Reject Pakistani Rule’: BNM Accuses Pakistan of Genocide in Balochistan, Launches Armed Resistance

Poll Do you think that protests and appeals by families of the abducted individuals can lead to change? Yes, they can raise awareness. No, they are largely ineffective.





The crisis of enforced disappearances in Pakistan's Balochistan region and beyond has deepened this week, as a disturbing string of abductions emerges from Karachi, Noshki, and Kech, according to The Balochistan Post (TBP).Among the most alarming cases is that of Muslim Dad Baloch, a fourth-semester philosophy student at the University of Karachi.On Monday evening, he was reportedly abducted near the university's Maskan Gate. Eyewitnesses say he was taken by unidentified men in a vehicle while returning to his hostel with friends.Originally from Mashkay in Awaran district, Muslim Dad was a familiar face within the Baloch student community in Karachi. His sudden disappearance has sparked fear among his peers and left his family devastated.In Noshki, another troubling case unfolded earlier today when Hafeezullah, the son of Peer Mohammad and a resident of Qaziabad, was allegedly picked up from his home by Pakistani security forces. His family has raised alarm over his unknown whereabouts and is demanding his immediate release.TBP also reported two recent disappearances in Kech district.On July 23, 16-year-old shopkeeper Qambar Baloch was allegedly taken by men believed to belong to Military Intelligence and the ISI while he was in Jusak, Turbat. And on June 27, Imran Khan, a 26-year-old student of Balochi language and culture at the University of Turbat, was reportedly abducted by Frontier Corps and Military Intelligence personnel in Turbat city—in broad daylight.“These are not isolated cases. This is a pattern,” said a representative from Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP), a group that has long campaigned for the safe recovery of abducted individuals. Despite repeated appeals and protests, most cases remain unresolved, with no accountability or formal investigations.","Muslim Dad Baloch, a fourth-semester philosophy student at the University of Karachi, was reportedly abducted on Monday.

Pakistan Blames India For Tensions, Credits Trump For Ceasefire Between Nuclear Rivals





Beijing/Islamabad: Pakistan army chief Asim Munir, who is on his first visit to China after his elevation as the field marshal, on Friday held talks with top Chinese leaders and discussed ways to deepen cooperation across all sectors. Munir held separate meetings with V-P Han Zheng, top military official general Zhang Youxia and foreign minister Wang Yi, according to official media reports.This is Munir's first visit to China after India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terrorist infrastructure in Pakistam in response to the Pahalgam terror attack. During the conflict, Pakistan used extensive military equipment supplied by China. This is also Munir's first visit to China after his trip to Washington, where he met US President Trump and sought to establish close ties with America, Beijing's strategic rival.The visit coincides with Pakistan's foreign minister Ishaq Dar making a trip to Washington, where he is expected to meet US secretary of state Marco Rubio.

ISLAMABAD: As jailed former PM Imran Khan completes two years in prison, his sons – Sulaiman and Qasim – have stepped into the political spotlight, launching an aggressive lobbying campaign in the United States to press for their father’s release just days before Khan’s call for a nationwide protest on Aug 5, which has put the state on edge.Khan, arrested on Aug 5, 2023, remains behind bars despite some convictions being overturned. He is currently serving time in three major cases that his party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), claims are part of a broader effort to keep him out of politics.He was convicted in the Toshakhana case, involving the illegal sale of state gifts received during his premiership. He was sentenced in the cipher case, accused of leaking classified diplomatic correspondence for political gain. And in the Al-Qadir Trust case, Khan and his wife were held liable for controversial land deals linked to a charitable trust.PTI has consistently maintained that the charges are politically motivated, aimed at “eliminating the most popular leader” in the country.Now, with most of PTI’s senior leadership jailed, exiled, or forced to resign, Khan’s sons have taken the international route. Based in the UK, the brothers have held meetings in Washington DC with US lawmakers, policy groups and human rights organisations, and are reportedly preparing to testify before congressional panels.Their message: Imran Khan is being held in solitary confinement in inhumane conditions, denied light, medical access, and family contact.The campaign has triggered speculation about whether the two sons might return to Pakistan, possibly to appear at the planned protest. While PTI has not confirmed this, party insiders say their presence could act as a powerful morale boost for the party’s dispersed support base.Meanwhile, the state has moved swiftly to neutralise any protest momentum. On July 22, an anti-terror court in Lahore sentenced eight senior PTI leaders, including Dr Yasmin Rashid, to 10 years in prison for their alleged role in the May 9 riots, when military installations were targeted after Khan’s initial arrest. Observers see the convictions as a tactical strike to undercut mobilisation ahead of the Aug 5 protest. The verdicts have raised concerns among legal experts about the selective use of terrorism laws against political opponents.From prison, Khan has issued a call for unity among PTI ranks, urging supporters to “shun differences” and prepare for what he called a decisive moment for Pakistan’s democracy. But the party remains fractured and leaderless, with ongoing rifts between loyalists and factions seen as open to negotiations with the establishment.At the heart of the political storm is the army chief, Field Marshal Asim Munir, who was controversially elevated to five-star rank in May. PTI blames him, along with PML-N and PPP leaders, for orchestrating what it calls a civil-military clampdown to sideline Khan and crush dissent.In a recent prison note, Khan mocked Munir as the “King of the Jungle”, accusing him of ruling the country through “fear, not law”.","Sulaiman and Qasim Khan have launched an aggressive lobbying campaign in the United States to press for their father’s release.

'Broken system, easy to manipulate'







A visa fraud network is being run by some Pakistani consultants who are exploiting loopholes in the UK immigration system, with one firm claiming a “98% success” rate for entry, according to a report by The Telegraph.The investigation found that forged documents, including fake CVs, employment letters, and bank statements, were being sold for up to £50,000 to secure work and student visas. These materials, riddled with basic errors, were being waved through by the UK home office, enabling illegal but technically “legal” entry into Britain.The report revealed that a widespread visa fraud operation targeting Britain’s immigration system, orchestrated by Pakistani consultants, with one guarantying entry into the UK with ""98% success"".""Syed Kamran Haider, the chief executive of Mirpur Visa Consultant (MVC) in the Pakistan-administered region of Kashmir, was found to be operating openly online, where he advertises loopholes in the UK asylum system, which experts described as 'easy to manipulate',"" the report said.MVC was charging thousands of pounds to fabricate documents such as fake CVs and bank statements for visa applicants. These falsified materials were used to meet UK immigration criteria.One such forged application, including a bogus employment letter from a non-existent hospital riddled with grammatical errors, was successfully used to secure a UK work visa, it said.UK-based immigration lawyer Harjap Bhangal blamed the nation's ""broken system"" which was ""easy to manipulate"".“If you claim asylum before that visa runs out, you can still work. The Home Office is a broken institution... They are not realising where the loopholes are [and] what is being done, what migrants are doing,” The Telegraph quoted him as saying.“These visa ‘consultants’ are “selling them a dream,” he said, adding: “[They are] selling a product essentially to people who don’t want to come back [home]. They have found their market. [It’s] quite a sophisticated scam.”Last year, Pakistanis filed 10,542 asylum applications in the UK, the highest from any single nationality and an 80% surge from the previous year, the report said citing government data. Despite these soaring numbers, Pakistanis rarely featured among the top 10 nationalities crossing into Britain via small boats, suggesting they were entering through legal visa channels, and staying there.","Visa fraud network being run by some Pakistani consultants exploiting loopholes in the UK immigration system. forged documents, including fake CVs, employment letters, and bank statements, were being sold for up to £50,000 to secure work and student visas.

Balochistan chief minister Sarfraz Bugti has confirmed the arrest of a tribal chief who allegedly ordered the so-called honour killing of a couple accused of having an affair.Condemning the incident, Bugti on Monday said, ""No one has a right, no matter what, to kill someone in such a painful and disgusting way, and then video shoot it. It is a crime. It is a murder. ”""We will make sure that they all will be prosecuted,"" he added, as quoted by Reuters.The incident came to light after a disturbing video went viral on social media last month.

The video then shows more gunfire aimed at both victims. ]According to provincial police chief Moazzam Jah Ansari, the woman’s brother carried out the shooting on behalf of her family and tribe. He added that Sher Baz Satakzai, the tribal chief, ordered the execution. Police have arrested 14 people in connection with the case, though it remains unclear if the brother is among them, according to Reuters.Chief minister Bugti said the man and woman both had children from previous marriages and were accused of having an affair out of wedlock.

Most victims, it noted, are women, and these murders are often carried out by relatives in the name of protecting family honour.","Balochistan chief minister Sarfraz Bugti has confirmed the arrest of a tribal chief who allegedly ordered the so-called honour killing of a couple.

TOI correspondent from Washington:

Asim Munir for President? Pakistan Defence Minister Denies Amid Buzz Of Asif Ali Zardari Quitting





A political and diplomatic dogfight is underway over a prospective visit to Pakistan by US President Donald Trump en route to the Quad summit in India in September amid a gradual recalibration of ties in the region.Pakistani business leaders and influencers are working overtime to convince the White House of a Trump visit after pulling off a coup by arranging a luncheon meeting last month for the country's army chief Asim Munir with the US President.Munir charmed Trump by endorsing him for a Nobel Peace Prize, playing up to his craving for one, and the Pakistanis are now promising the US President more honors and trade access if he visits, despite having thrown itself at China's feet for survival.Although the White House has not confirmed Trump's Quad attendance given New Delhi is yet to nail the dates -- which also depends on the leaders of Japan and Australia -- Pakistan's excitable media broadcast that the US President would visit Pakistan on September 18, before retracting the report because Trump will be on a state visit to the UK from September 17-19.There are indications though that Trump may stopover in Pakistan whenever he heads out to the Quad summit.This could be as late as November given the MAGA supremo's obsession with trade deals over strategic alignments. He has just delivered a tariff shock to Japan and also riled up Australia, while India has proved to be a tough negotiator, frustrating his trade boffins attempts to strong-arm New Delhi into a quick deal.In fact, Trump's fetish for tariffs and his fixation on trade deals puts a question mark over the strategic salience of the Quad even as long-time allies and partners adjust to his mercurial approach.According to some diplomats, India itself may have to reassess its approach to Trump-era Washington after a rosy-eyed view of long-term strategic ties with the US. They acknowledge that Trump’s response during his second term to the Pakistani outreach – driven more by opportunism than any strategic vision – clearly caught India off guard. New Delhi resents the re-hyphenation that would be implicit in such a two-fer, but has no way of thwarting it.If Trump does visit Pakistan, it will be the first US Presidential trip to the country in nearly two decades after George W Bush layover in 2006. Bush stopped by in Islamabad for a few hours under a tight security blanket on his way back from a three-day visit to New Delhi, talking up counter-terrorism cooperation with Pakistan while rejecting its pleas for a nuclear deal similar to the one he forged with India.Presidents Obama and Biden both disdained even a stopover while Trump himself trashed Pakistan during his first term, accusing it of ""nothing but lies & deceit"" and providing ""safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan.""Pakistan is now promising to turn itself into a safe haven for US businesses promoted by Trump associates -- including transforming Islamabad into the ""crypto capital of South Asia"" and a ""global leader in the digital finance revolution,’ -- to land a Presidential visit.During his first term, Trump is famously said to have complained about landing in Iraq and Afghanistan with the lights on Air Force One turned off (as a security measure), despite the US having spent billions on the countries. If the Pakistan stopover comes through, he may well insist on landing in full sight – to soak up the fanfare and flattery.","Pakistani business leaders and influencers are working overtime to convince the White House of a Trump visit.

KATHMANDU: The narrow streets of Kathmandu - sized for pedestrians and rickshaws - are choked with engines. Buses, motorbikes, small trucks and taxis fill the sprawling valley with horns and exhaust. For its more than 3 million residents, just getting around is a dangerous, eye-stinging ordeal.But recently, a new kind of motor has started to ease the crush. Sleek electric vehicles glide by with a quiet hum. Gleaming showrooms do a brisk business in the latest models, and charging stations on highways have turned into rest stops with cafes for drivers. Over the past year, EVs accounted for 76% of all passenger vehicles and half of the light commercial vehicles sold in Nepal. Five years ago, that number was essentially zero. The EV market share in Nepal is now behind only those of a few countries, including Norway, Singapore and Ethiopia. The average for all countries was 20% in 2024.The swift turnover is the result of govt policies aimed at leveraging Nepal's wealth of hydropower, easing dependence on imported fossil fuels and clearing the smog. It has been fed by an intense push from Nepal's biggest neighbour, China, world's dominant manufacturer of battery-powered vehicles.""For us, using EVs is a comparative advantage,"" said Mahesh Bhattarai, DG of Nepal's department of customs. ""In the global market, Chinese EVs are expanding. The same is happening in Nepal."" The effort stands in contrast to policies in the US and Europe, which have blocked Chinese EVs to protect their domestic auto industries. And it carries hope for other developing countries that seek to become wealthier without enduring the crucible of pollution from which many rich nations have already emerged.""We're interested in making sure this rapid growth in these emerging markets doesn't follow the same trajectory as developed markets,"" said the head of sustainable transportation for UN Environment Programme. But as Nepal has learned, there are obstacles. The country has spent heavily on subsidies, and getting rid of the support too quickly could derail the shift to battery power. Even if gas-powered passenger cars are phased out, cleaning the air will require public transportation to go electric as well.Asian Development Bank has been a key financier of Nepal's dams, transmission lines and charging networks. The head of ADB's resident mission in Nepa is cautious about the risk of backsliding. ""Given the economic sense this EV conversion represents, I think I would see it as unlikely that we would have major policy change.""Businesses and advocates are, however, concerned Nepal may already be backing off its commitment to the transition. It has had three PMs in past five years, and priorities have shifted with each of them. Nepal's central bank doubled down-payment requirements for EVs. Govt has been inching up its tariffs on EVs. And auto dealers worry faulty cars from some smaller Chinese brands could discredit the category. Rajan Babu Shrestha holds the licence to distribute cars in Nepal from Tata Motors. He has seen sales skyrocket on his EVs, but he could go back to selling gas-powered vehicles if tariffs rose or subsidies for charging stations went away. ""Stability is always a question mark.""","Electric vehicles account for 76% of all passenger vehicles and half of light commercial vehicles sold in Nepal.

Harry's olive branch







Prince Harry has agreed to share his official diary with the royal family to avoid clashes in public appearances and ease ongoing tensions.The move comes after his recent trip to Angola made headlines for revisiting princess Diana’s iconic anti-landmine walk, on the same day Queen Camilla's 78th birthday portrait was released. Harry’s photos reportedly overshadowed the coverage of the Queen’s milestone, which did not go down well with the palace.According to The Mail, Harry is now open to “deconflicting” his schedule with other senior royals, including Prince William’s team at Kensington palace.Their PR teams have reportedly kept in touch since private talks began earlier this year. In fact, aides from both camps were seen meeting at a London members club earlier this month.Harry is also quietly pushing for a more personal reconnection with his father. According to royal expert Hilary Fordwich, King Charles remains “cautious and wary” of Harry’s recent efforts. She said ,“Harry misses the UK and many aspects of royal life, but his return risks more disclosures, and that worries the family,” she added.Royal biographer Tom Bower told The Mirror that Harry is “seriously worried” about being permanently shut out.“He’s afraid that once Charles is gone, William will banish him from the UK entirely,” Bower said.This fear reportedly led to a discreet meeting at the Royal Over-Seas League in London last week. Harry’s aides flew in to meet King Charles’ top communications official, Tobyn Andreae. Witnesses said the two teams chatted on the garden terrace before moving indoors. Though there was no set agenda, both sides “had things to talk about”.","Prince Harry has agreed to share his official diary with the royal family to avoid clashes in public appearances and ease ongoing tensions.

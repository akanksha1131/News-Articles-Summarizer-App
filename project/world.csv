The factors influencing turkey prices this Thanksgiving

Grocery stores in the US are absorbing the rising cost of turkeys this Thanksgiving. A spike in bird flu cases has pushed up wholesale prices, according to new data from the US department of agriculture (USDA). But these higher costs are not being passed on to shoppers.USDA figures show that advertised turkey prices in supermarkets are roughly the same as last year. Experts say stores are taking the hit to keep customers coming in, reported NBC News. Even the projected cost of a full Thanksgiving meal has stayed broadly steady.The main reason for the higher costs is a drop in supply. Bird flu has spread again among commercial poultry farms this autumn. By October, more than 2 million turkeys had been culled after exposure. Minnesota, the largest turkey-producing state, reported six confirmed outbreaks that month.David Ortega, a food economist at Michigan State University, told NBC, another virus avian metapneumovirus is also affecting production by reducing the number of viable eggs laid by hens. This has slowed farmers’ efforts to rebuild their flocks.Overall, turkey supply is tightening. The USDA expects production to fall to 4.8 million pounds this year, down from 5.1 million pounds in 2024.This shortage has pushed up costs for retailers. USDA data shows the wholesale price of frozen turkeys, the type most families buy for Thanksgiving, has jumped by about 80% since last year, rising from under $1 per pound to more than $1.70.A separate USDA report shows retail prices for frozen turkeys staying flat. Ortega said shops may be absorbing these increases to stop customers from switching stores. Retailers often use turkeys as a “loss leader”, selling them at or below cost to draw in shoppers and make up the difference through other items in their baskets.While turkey prices have stayed stable for shoppers, the overall cost of a Thanksgiving meal varies depending on the data source. Some estimates show prices rising by nearly 10%, while others show a fall of up to 5%.",USDA figures show that advertised turkey prices in supermarkets are roughly the same as last year.

Europe's Shocking Pitch Amid US-led Ukraine Peace Talks, Makes 'Anti-Russia' Declaration





US President Donald Trump said Tuesday his plan to end the war in Ukraine has been ""fine-tuned"" and he's sending envoy Steve Witkoff to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin and army secretary Dan Driscoll to meet with Ukrainian officials. He suggested he could eventually meet with Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, but not until further progress has been made in negotiations.Speaking to reporters on Tuesday evening aboard Air Force One, Trump said resolving the war was difficult, and described what had been a 28-point plan as a work in progress. ""That was not a plan - it was a concept,"" Trump said.On Wednesday, a Russian diplomat said the Kremlin won't make big concessions on the peace plan, after a leaked recording of a call involving Witkoff showed he had advised Moscow on how to pitch to Trump. While Trump said that progress was being made and Moscow was making concessions, Russian deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov said, ""There can be no question of any concessions, or any surrender of our approaches to those key points. ""Moscow also raised concerns about the leak to Bloomberg News of the transcript of a call between Witkoff and Putin's foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov. Trump, on Air Force One, brushed aside a question from a reporter about why Witkoff appeared to be coaching Russian officials as simply ""what a dealmaker does"" and ""a very standard form of negotiation"".But Russia said the leak was an unacceptable attempt to undermine peace efforts and amounted to hybrid warfare.European countries, which are alarmed by Russia's aggression and see their own future at stake in negotiations over Ukraine, are fighting to make their voices heard in the talks as Washington takes the lead.German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Wednesday that Europe wants the war to end as quickly as possible. ""But an agreement negotiated by great powers without the approval of the Ukrainians and without the approval of the Europeans won't be a basis for a real, sustainable peace in Ukraine,"" Merz told lawmakers in Berlin. ""Europe is not a plaything, but a sovereign actor for its own interests and values.""The head of the European Union 's executive, European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen, was upbeat about recent developments, saying there is ""an opportunity here to make real progress"" toward peace.She insisted that any settlement must include future security guarantees for Ukraine. Von der Leyen added that a deal can't contain limitations on Ukraine's armed forces or block its path to Nato membership.

Erika Kirk pregnant? Usha Vance's missing ring? Tracking the crazy rumours swirling in MAGA town,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/erika-kirk-pregnant-usha-vances-missing-ring-tracking-the-crazy-rumours-swirling-in-maga-town/articleshow/125565496.cms,"The internet spent the past week convinced it had uncovered a political soap opera, even though the only thing on display was grief, coincidence and a great deal of imagination. A widow spoke about the future she lost, a vice president offered a public hug and a mother stepped out without her wedding ring. These separate, ordinary moments were stitched together by the MAGAverse into a rumour that Erika Kirk was secretly pregnant and Usha Vance was quietly separating. None of it was true. All of it was loud. The real story was quieter and far more human.

The hug that turned into a storyline

Erika Kirk’s Remark About Pregnancy On Megyn Kelly Show Sparks Storm Around Charlie Kirk & JD Vance

A ringless moment becomes Exhibit Three

How separate lives became a shared rumour

What remains when the noise fades





There are weeks when the internet behaves like a restless crowd that cannot resist the temptation to turn private sorrow into public speculation. The latest rumour cyclone began on 22 November 2025 during Erika Kirk’s live conversation with Megyn Kelly in Glendale, Arizona. Erika spoke with the kind of openness that only grief makes possible. She described how, on the day Charlie Kirk was murdered, she had prayed she might have been pregnant. It was not an announcement and it was not meant to invite attention. It was a window into the shock and longing that accompany sudden loss. She was speaking about the future she and Charlie had imagined, and the wish that a part of him might still live on. Yet within hours, the internet detached her words from their emotional truth and recast them as a secret confession. What was said as a lament became interpreted as a clue.Almost a month earlier, on 29 October 2025, Erika had introduced Vice President JD Vance at a Turning Point event in Mississippi. The two shared a brief embrace on stage. It was a public gesture of solidarity during a period where condolences, political duty and emotional exhaustion had become unavoidable companions.It should have been forgotten after the livestream ended. Instead, long after the moment had passed, the hug returned as supporting material for the rumour mill. Viewers slowed down recordings and analysed the still frames like detectives searching for hidden motives. A simple gesture of support was treated as if it carried unspoken intention. Nothing in the image justified the reaction. The frenzy was built entirely from interpretation rather than action.The rumours escalated further when Usha Vance became entangled in the speculation. On 19 November 2025, she attended an event without her wedding ring. There was no announcement or comment from her. In ordinary life, people remove rings for reasons that range from washing hands to childcare to forgetfulness. None of these reasons usually require explanation. However, because the internet had already convinced itself that Erika was signalling something and that JD Vance’s hug had meaning, Usha’s bare finger was folded into the same imagined plot. A single photograph was treated as evidence of marital trouble, even though nothing publicly indicated such a thing. The absence of jewellery was transformed into symbolism purely because the moment happened to coincide with unrelated speculation.The poignancy of this episode lies in how easily distinct events were fused together into a single narrative. Erika Kirk was mourning the future she lost and trying to articulate the rawness of that grief. JD Vance was offering ordinary comfort in a public space. Usha Vance was photographed while going about her day. None of these moments were linked and none of them carried the weight that the internet assigned to them. The public, however, often prefers the convenience of narrative over the difficulty of reality. It is simpler to believe that everything is connected than to accept that people are living through their own struggles independently.The facts are straightforward. Erika Kirk has not announced a pregnancy. There is no credible suggestion that JD Vance’s hug signified anything beyond empathy. There is no confirmed sign that Usha Vance is separating from her husband. What actually happened was a widow expressing sorrow, a politician offering support and a mother briefly appearing without her wedding ring. Yet the rumour machine converted these ordinary moments into a storyline that never existed. When the frenzy inevitably moves on, the only people left to face the lingering distortions are those whose grief and privacy were turned into content.This is the tragic irony of the MAGAverse’s rumour cycles. They begin with imagination, escalate through repetition and end with the quiet realisation that nothing scandalous occurred. The real story was never about hidden pregnancies or strained marriages. It was about how quickly empathy is replaced by intrigue in a world that has grown too comfortable treating people as symbols instead of individuals.","The internet spent the past week convinced it had uncovered a political soap opera, even though the only thing on display was grief, coincidence and a great deal of imagination.

"Trump Gold Card: $15,000 application fee to buy US residency for $1 million, draft petition ready ahead of December 18 deadline",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-gold-card-15000-application-fee-to-buy-us-residency-for-1-million-draft-petition-ready-ahead-of-december-18-deadline/articleshow/125549023.cms,"New details on Trump Gold Card visa program have been released.



New details on Gold Card visa program

The application is to be filed with the Department of Commerce

The $15,000 fee per application is non-refundable

The petition is to be filed with USCIS, following which USCIS would assess the applicant's eligibility for the new visa category.

The vetting process also includes a check on whether the fund originated from a lawful source.

Once the petition is approved and when an immigrant visa number is available, then the applicant has to complete the consular processing at the embassy.

The applicant would then get an immigrant visa to travel to the US and be admitted as a lawful permanent resident.

What is the $5 million visa program?





In a major update of Donald Trump's Gold Card visa program, which is to be implemented by December 18, the Department of Homeland Security and the US Citizenship and Immigration Services prepared the draft of the petition that an applicant has to submit. Form I-140G, also known as Immigration Petition for the Gold Card Program, have been submitted for clearance with the Office of Management and Budget. Bloomberg reported that the department has already got an emergency approval from White House.An individual would be eligible for permanent residence under this visa program after a donation of $1 million and for corporate petitioners, the amount is $2 million. The application fee would be $15,000 per applicant. After creating a ripple when the president launched the program and the administration officials claimed that they would be selling 1,000 Gold Cards a day, the program took a backseat amid the administration's hard approach to immigrants. But now things have started rolling ahead of the December 18 deadline, announced by Trump earlier.The donation would make the foreign nationals eligible for permanent residence under the EB-1 preference category for individuals of extraordinary ability or the EB-2 National Interest Waiver category.The $5 million visa program is Trump's Platinum Card though initially Gold Card was said to be priced at $5 million. The price which is being called a donation to the US government was revised and now the $5 million card is Trump's Platinum Card. This will give applicants the ability to spend up to 270 days in the US without being subject to US taxes on non-US income. No further details of this program have been released yeat and there is an option to join the waitlist for this card.","The $15,000 fee per application is non-refundable.

Indian-origin billionaire Vivek Ramaswamy 's net worth jumped astronomically in the past nine months since he announced his bid in the Ohio Governor election 2026 -- despite the relentless online slandering and Hindu hate that he faces. Even MAGA turned against him after he called for introspection in teh Republican Party following socialist Zohran Mamdani's win in the New York mayoral election. As MAGA wanted a replacement for Ramaswamy, President Donald Trump had to pitch in and endorse him again as the GOP candidate for the Ohio Governor election.Latest Forbes figures reveal that none of this impacts the billionaire's net worth while he's going to be a father for the third time soon. Revealing his current net worth, Forbes called Ramaswamy a man who bounces back quickly -- as Ramaswamy bounced back from his lost bid for 2024 presidential election and then his DOGE stint. He is also known as an H-1B supporter as he criticized American culture, education system earlier and defended why US companies hire STEM workers from foreign countries.""In March, Forbes estimated his net worth at just about $1 billion, barely making our World Billionaires List.Today, he’s worth about $1.8 billion, an 80% increase in just nine months all while running for office,"" the report said.The source of the major gain, as identified by the report, is his old pharma company, Roivant Sciences, the company he founded in 2014. A subsidiary of Roivant this year announced positive results in a Phase 3 trial for an autoimmune disease drug and that's what is still making Ramaswamy richer by the day. Ramaswamy’s stake in the company, roughly 49 million shares, is now worth $1 billion on its own.A spokesperson confirmed to Forbes that the numbers are ""broadly correct"". He pointed out another source of Ramaswamy's wealth: Chapter, a startup that he co-founded in 2020.Ramaswamy's wealth grows even after he poured $26 million of his own money into his presidential bid which he withdrew later.

Citing concerns for national security, officials argue that the previous administration failed to conduct adequate vetting. Refugee rights activists strongly condemn this decision as 'deeply inhumane' and a painful reminder of past traumas.

Biometric Crackdown: Green Card Holders Face New Rules as US Tightens Immigration Security

'Unspeakably cruel'

What will happen after re-interview?

USCIS will terminate the refugee status of pepple if they are found not to meet refugee criteria.

The memo said the USCIS will also review and re-interview refugees admitted outside the timeframe.

USCIS may deny green cards even for those who already have them.

There will be no appeal against the denial and the only legal option will be to contest the removal order in an immigration court.





The Donald Trump administration has made a major decision to reinterview certain refugees who were admitted to the US by the previous Joe Biden administration. Until the reinterview, the administration will not proceed with the process of granting the refugees a Green Card. Anyone admitted to the US as a refugee is eligible and required to apply for a Green Card after a year of living in the US.CNN repported that the US Citizenship and Immigration Services issued a memo that the administration is planning a comprehensive review and re-interview of all refugees admitted between January 20, 2021 and February 20, 2025 -- the period that captures the Biden administration.The administration called the decision an operational necessity to ensure that refugees do not pose a national security or public safety threat. They claimed that the previous administration did not sufficiently vet the people who entered the US. Around 235,000 refugees entered the US between 2021 and 2025 after proving to the administration that they were facing persecuttion in their home countries.Mark Hetfield, the president of HIAS, a refugee resettlement organization, told CNN that the decision is unspeakably cruel. “Just the threat of this is unspeakably cruel. … To threaten refugees with taking away their status would be re-traumatizing and a vicious misuse of taxpayer money,"" he said. “They pass intensive reviews of their refugee status, background checks, and security screenings.

Trump Tells Female Reporter ‘Quiet, Piggy’ After Being Asked About Epstein Files





US president Donald Trump on Wednesday lashed out at a New York Times reporter, calling her “ugly inside and out”. The comment came after the newspaper published a story questioning whether the 80-year-old president was slowing down.Trump’s criticism was directed at Katie Rogers, one of the reporters who wrote the piece. In a Truth Social post, he accused her of being “assigned to write only bad things” about him and called her a “third-rate reporter”.“The writer of the story, Katie Rogers, who is assigned to write only bad things about me, is a third rate reporter who is ugly, both inside and out,” he wrote. The president then wrote about how hard he has worked this year.He further said, “There will be a day when I run low on energy, it happens to everyone, but with a perfect physical exam and a comprehensive cognitive test (‘that was aced’) just recently taken, it certainly is not now.”The New York Times had reported that Trump was showing signs of tiredness in recent weeks, noting that he appeared drowsy during an event at the Oval Office earlier this month. The article also mentioned ongoing questions about his health after he confirmed undergoing an MRI in October, which he said was part of a routine physical.The newspaper stood by its reporting. A spokesperson said the story was based on first-hand information and added that personal attacks would not stop its journalists from covering the administration.“Expert and thorough reporters like Katie Rogers exemplify how an independent and free press helps the American people better understand their government and its leaders,” it reads.Trump has repeatedly targeted female reporters with sharp and personal remarks. Less than two weeks ago, he called a Bloomberg correspondent “piggy” on Air Force One. He also recently dismissed an ABC News reporter as a “terrible person” during a tense exchange over questions on Jamal Khashoggi and the Epstein files.Over the years, Trump has often directed his harshest language at women in the press, using terms like “nasty” and referring to menstruation to brush aside tough questions.","The New York Times had reported that Trump was showing signs of tiredness in recent weeks.

Georgia prosecutor kills 2020 election interference case against Trump and allies





A judge in Georgia has dismissed the last pending criminal case against president Donald Trump, ending efforts to charge him for trying to overturn the 2020 election.With this, all three criminal cases filed against him before his re-election have now been taken down. Charges against his co-accused, including Rudy Giuliani and Mark Meadows, were also dropped.The Georgia case was considered a major legal threat because a state conviction cannot be undone by a presidential pardon. But on Wednesday, Pete Skandalakis, who leads the state’s nonpartisan prosecutor council, asked the court to close the case. He said the earlier charges brought by Fulton County district attorney Fani Willis did not hold, arguing that challenging election results is not a crime.Skandalakis also said the federal investigation led by special counsel Jack Smith was the proper venue to review Trump’s actions. He pointed to the Supreme Court ruling giving presidents “absolute immunity” for official acts, saying it would delay any Georgia trial until after Trump leaves office in 2029, which he felt was not practical for the people of Georgia.Trump’s lawyer Steve Sadow welcomed the decision, calling the case political. The case had already faced setbacks after Willis was removed over her past relationship with a lawyer she had hired for the prosecution.Trump was first indicted in August 2023, linked to his 2021 call asking Georgia’s secretary of state to “find” enough votes to change the result. The case expanded to include 18 allies. After Trump returned to office, federal prosecutors also dropped two other cases against him. He still has a separate New York conviction for falsifying business records.","Georgia prosecutor kills 2020 election interference case against Trump and allies.

'Not many willing to live surgeon's stressful life'





NEW DELHI: India's top-performing medical graduates have made their preference clear in this year's NEET-PG counselling - career stability is trumping the operating table.In the first round of NEET-PG 2025, medicine and radiology dominated choices among high-rankers while general surgery saw one of its steepest drops in recent years, reflecting growing concerns over stress, long training pathways and mounting medico-legal pressures.Among the first 1,500 candidates, 632 (42%) chose MD general medicine and 447 (30%) opted for MD radiodiagnosis. Only 99 students (6.6%) selected MS general surgery, indicating a widening shift away from high-risk procedural fields.A strong preference for Delhi emerged in this year's NEET-PG counselling , with six of the top 10 candidates choosing Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital.Dr Neeraj Nischal from department of medicine at AIIMS said the consistent popularity of medicine is unsurprising. ""MD Medicine is the gateway to almost all superspecialities, so it has always been in high demand. Students feel diagnostics offers a more controlled work life, though that may not always be true. Decisions are often influenced by seniors.""The fall in interest for surgery, senior clinicians say, is rooted in deeper anxieties.""Surgical branches are very demanding - you need passion. Otherwise, burnout is inevitable,"" Dr Nischal said.Surgeons themselves acknowledge that the field has steadily lost appeal. ""This is not new,"" said Dr Piyush Ranjan from the AIIMS surgery department. ""A decade ago, surgery was seen as a very lucrative branch, but several factors have changed that. It takes much longer to settle down because general surgery is only the first step - you usually need to super-specialise in neurosurgery, cardiac surgery, urology or paediatric surgery. ""He said the risks make many hesitate. ""There is a thin line between success and failure. Even a minor procedure can lead to catastrophic bleeding if a vessel is injured. In today's era of litigation and heightened patient awareness, convincing patients to undergo surgery is often difficult.

Surgery isn't just a career choice - it has to be a passion,"" Dr Ranjan said.Another senior doctor noted that while diagnostics requires significant investment, surgical departments face high litigation pressure, contributing to student reluctance to take up the latter.Experts warn the overwhelming tilt towards medicine and radiology could increase shortages in vital surgical specialties over the next decade. For now, India's young doctors appear to have made priorities clear: stability is winning over the scalpel.","In first round of NEET-PG 2025, medicine and radiology dominated choices among high-rankers.

A philanthropic approach shaped by access, equity and scale

A full circle story of kindness and opportunity





MacKenzie Scott, one of the world’s most influential philanthropists, has come full circle after once relying on a friend’s financial help to stay in college. As a Princeton undergraduate, Scott faced dropping out when she could not afford $1,000 in fees, until her roommate Jeannie Tarkenton secured the money for her. Decades later, Scott, now a billionaire, is backing Tarkenton’s student-lending startup in a gesture many see as a symbolic return of kindness.Scott has written that the experience of receiving help at a vulnerable moment influenced her views on generosity. Her former roommate recalls finding her in tears and arranging the $1,000 loan that allowed Scott to continue her studies at Princeton. Decades later, she is effectively repaying that act by becoming a financial backer of the company her former roommate went on to build, channelling resources into the same kind of students who face the struggles she once did. The story has resurfaced as Scott continues to direct her wealth toward expanding educational access, equity, and economic opportunity.With a net worth estimated at around 34 billion dollars, Scott has given away more than 19 billion dollars since her 2019 divorce from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos , in which she received a substantial shareholding. Rather than establishing a traditional foundation or maintaining a public philanthropy profile, she became known for issuing surprise, unrestricted grants to organisations serving disadvantaged communities, often without seeking attention or public credit.Tarkenton, the roommate who helped Scott stay enrolled, later founded Funding U, a for-profit lending company offering merit-based loans to low-income students who lack co-signers. Scott has become a key financial supporter of the venture, providing capital that reduces risk for banks and makes it possible for more students to secure funding. The company assesses applicants based on academic records, internship experience, and likelihood of completing a degree, a model supporters say better reflects the realities of first-generation and low-income students.Following her divorce, Scott launched a large-scale giving initiative that directed billions of dollars to organisations across the United States. Her donations have supported education, community development, women’s initiatives, food access, and poverty reduction. Among her most widely recognised contributions were major gifts to Historically Black Colleges and Universities, as well as tribal, Indigenous-serving, and community colleges that had rarely received major private donations in the past.Scott once relied on a small loan to stay in university, and she is now supporting a venture designed to ensure other students do not face the same barrier. The renewed connection between Scott and Tarkenton highlights how early experiences can shape long-term commitments to expanding opportunity and educational access. What began as a modest favour between friends has evolved into an initiative reaching students across the country, demonstrating how individual acts of support can grow into broader systems of opportunity.","As a Princeton undergraduate, MacKenzie Scott faced dropping out when she could not afford $1,000 in fees.

Yet you fired a ton of people who took care of that land and want to destroy it for oil.

Sounds like another grift as you kill tourism -- great f****g work!





Are you guys really that stupid to think that tourists will opt to go? You’re going to leave the NPS with a funding shortfall. More stupidity like firing the majority of park workers





So Americans get discounted access, foreigners pay more, and everything’s going digital.

BTW stop tracking us, we don't appreciate it. When you show your American The Beautiful Pass at the gate - they scan BOTH your pass AND your ID. That is a violation of our civil rights.





America really said “tourists pay, patriots play free” and called it progress





A row erupted after the US Department of the Interior announced sweeping changes to national park access, including higher fees for nonresidents and expanded digital passes. Starting January 1, 2026, US residents will pay $80 for an Annual Pass, while nonresidents will be charged $250.Nonresidents without a pass will also face a $100 per person fee to enter 11 of the most visited parks.“President Trump’s leadership always puts American families first,” said Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum. “These policies ensure that US taxpayers, who already support the National Park System, continue to enjoy affordable access, while international visitors contribute their fair share to maintaining and improving our parks for future generations.”The Department has also announced a set of resident-only patriotic fee-free days for 2026. These include President’s Day, Memorial Day, Flag Day and President Trump’s birthday, the Independence Day weekend, the 110th Birthday of the National Park Service, Constitution Day, Theodore Roosevelt’s birthday and Veteran’s Day.Revenue from the revised fee structure will be invested directly back into the national parks, supporting upgrades to visitor facilities, essential maintenance work and improved services across the system. Critics have urged the Department to take a closer look at how the higher nonresident rates affect H-1B and F-1 visa holders. The new charges could disproportionately burden international visitors.","The US Department of the Interior announced sweeping changes to national park access.

Democrats have no solution to fix education: Vivek Ramaswamy attacks Ohio governor candidate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/democrats-have-no-solution-to-fix-education-vivek-ramaswamy-attacks-ohio-governor-candidate/articleshow/125594674.cms,"Ramaswamy links lockdown closures to widening inequality

Vivek Ramaswamy Campaigns in Ohio Town Hall After Viral Cincinnati Assault

Education becomes a key dividing line in the Ohio election





Republican frontrunner Vivek Ramaswamy has intensified the political spotlight on education in Ohio, accusing Democratic gubernatorial candidate and former state health director Dr Amy Acton of worsening inequality by supporting statewide school closures during the COVID-19 lockdown. In a widely shared campaign video, Ramaswamy argued that Democrats have ‘no solution to fix education’ and claimed that the shutdowns caused learning losses that children ‘will never fully recover from’, particularly in disadvantaged communities.Ramaswamy’s criticism focuses on the March 2020 suspension of in-person learning across Ohio, a decision implemented during the early spread of the pandemic. He argues that the closures disproportionately harmed low-income families, widened achievement gaps, and reduced academic progression, citing research showing declines in reading and maths performance during remote schooling. He claims that Democrats are now ‘pretending to care about inequality after creating it’ and is positioning education as a central issue in the 2026 governor’s race.In the video, Ramaswamy says that ‘Democrats love to preach about educational inequality, but they have no solutions to fix it’ and insists that ‘if we want to get serious about fixing the problem, we have got to think creatively’. He highlights a school he visited that ‘serves a Medicaid-only population, takes the school day out to 4 p.m.,allows more time for physical education, and more flexibility for parents’.Ramaswamy also challenges his opponent directly, saying that ‘if Democrats want to distort my position, let them’ and arguing that ‘my opponent, Amy Acton, has absolutely zero vision for how she is going to help education in Ohio’. He finishes the video with the declaration that ‘we know you locked down our schools, but that is not a solution’ and that ‘we are finding a better way forward’.Supporters say his message resonates with parents who remain frustrated with the long-term effects of the pandemic and who favour extended school days, expanded physical activity, and flexible schedules to address what he calls the ‘summer slide’.Acton, who became a recognisable public figure during the pandemic, has defended the shutdowns as precautionary steps taken during a period of uncertainty. She has dismissed Ramaswamy’s claims as political opportunism and says attacks on her record overlook the broader public health context of 2020.With both candidates using schools to symbolise wider questions about public services, inequality, and cultural identity, education has emerged as one of the most emotionally charged issues of the 2026 contest. The campaign will test whether voter resentment over lockdowns still holds influence, or whether Ohioans now prioritise stability, investment, and recovery in the post-pandemic period.",Republican frontrunner Vivek Ramaswamy has intensified the political spotlight on education in Ohio.

Among the claims were allegations of misusing government aircraft for personal jaunts to visit his girlfriend, controversial decisions regarding the handling of Jeffrey Epstein's case, and the dismissal of senior FBI personnel.

Trump To FIRE Kash Patel As FBI Director? White House Denies, Slams ‘FAKE’ MS NOW Report

Here are some of the controversies involving Patel:

1. Girlfriend Alexis Wilkins

2. Jeffrey Epstein Files

3. Purge of FBI Senior Staff

4. Polygraph and loyalty vetting controversy

5. Shein and private business ties





Indian-origin Kash Patel has brought a lot of controversy with him since he was appointed as the FBI director under the Trump administration.His influence in the MAGA base has overshadowed a lot of his drama, but there are still some things that left an imprint on the common people, which the Democrats now use as fuel for their propaganda.Kash Patel is under fire for using a government-owned jet for trips that appear personal, including travel to see his girlfriend, Alexis Wilkins, perform at wrestling events. These flights are funded by taxpayers and have raised questions about misuse of federal resources and adherence to proper protocol in such high positions.In addition, Patel reportedly deployed FBI SWAT agents to provide security for Wilkins at public appearances. This move misused elite personnel normally reserved for high-risk operations. Patel’s office has defended both the jet use and SWAT protection, insisting all actions followed agency rules.Patel faced backlash after Congressman Suhas Subramanyam wrote to him regarding the security of Jeffrey Epstein files released by the FBI. The congressman said that it cannot be ruled out that tampering or political interference is possible under Trump administration, questioning Patel’s role in handling sensitive documents.Democrats said that the influence of MAGA allies could have compromised the integrity of the release process. Patel denied any misconduct, but the row regarding debate over transparency and impartiality in federal investigations only grew, particularly those involving high-profile figures.Before his confirmation, Patel was accused of orchestrating the removal of senior FBI staff. Whistle-blowers alleged that Patel personally influenced dismissals of top bureau officials. This was seen as an abuse of power, raising concerns that political loyalty, rather than merit or misconduct, guided personnel decisions. Senators and watchdogs said that such actions could compromise the independence of the FBI.Progressives claimed that these dismissals compromised institutional memory and morale, while Patel and his office denied any wrongdoing.Patel reportedly oversaw an expansion of polygraph testing within the FBI. He did it for national-security purposes and also to detect leaks and assess internal loyalty. Some agents were reportedly questioned about personal opinions or criticisms of Patel. Former employees described a climate of fear where dissent was discouraged or silenced. The process allegedly led to forced resignations or departures of senior and mid-level staff, damaging morale.Patel’s financial interests in private companies, including holdings connected to the fast-fashion firm Shein, have stirred a row, as owning such shares raises questions for someone holding a high public office.Critics argue that ownership stakes in firms with overseas manufacturing and labor controversies could present conflicts of interest, particularly for a senior national security official. Past consultancy contracts with foreign-linked clients have also been brought up for questioning. Patel has denied any wrongdoing and maintains that his private business dealings did not interfere with his official duties.","Kash Patel's time as FBI chief during the Trump administration stirred considerable debate.

Key findings





Institutional weaknesses





Context and IMF programmes









The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned that persistent corruption and “state capture” in Pakistan are at the root of its ongoing economic crisis, where public policy is manipulated to benefit a narrow circle of political and business elites.The findings are part of the Governance and Corruption Diagnostic Assessment (GCDA), finalised in November 2025 and requested by the Pakistani government. The 186-page report paints a grim picture of dysfunctional institutions unable to enforce the rule of law or safeguard public resources, reported AljazeeraAccording to the IMF, corruption in Pakistan is “persistent and corrosive”, distorting markets, eroding public trust, and undermining fiscal stability. The report warns that without dismantling structures of “elite privilege”, economic stagnation will continue.“Failure of implementation [of laws and principles of accountability] gives vested interests too often free rein and addressing this must be at the core of efforts for economic reform,” said Stefan Dercon, professor of economic policy at the University of Oxford.The GCDA highlights that corruption is most damaging when privileged entities exert influence over key economic sectors, including state-owned or affiliated industries.The IMF estimates that tax exemptions and subsidies to such entities drain billions annually, limiting private sector growth.Ali Hasanain, associate professor at Lahore University of Management Sciences, said the IMF’s conclusions are consistent with prior domestic and international studies.“Powerful interests shape rules to maintain their advantage,” Hasanain told Al Jazeera, noting similar findings in a 2021 UNDP report.The report estimates that Pakistan could achieve 5–6.5 per cent GDP growth over five years by implementing governance reforms. Pakistan’s GDP stood at $340 billion in 2024.The IMF identifies the special investment facilitation council (SIFC) and public sector entities as major areas of concern. The SIFC, formed in June 2023 to promote investment, operates with limited transparency and legal accountability. The report urges the council to publish annual investment reports and details of concessions granted.The judiciary and key anti-corruption bodies like the national accountability bureau (NAB) and federal investigation agency (FIA) are also flagged. The judiciary faces over two million pending cases, while selective accountability by NAB has damaged public trust. Despite recovering 5.3 trillion rupees ($17 billion) in 2023–24, NAB’s low conviction rates remain a concern.The GCDA criticises recent constitutional amendments that created a parallel Federal Constitutional Court, warning that they could increase executive influence over judicial appointments.Pakistan has turned to the IMF 25 times since 1958. The current programme, initiated under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, is a 37-month, $7 billion arrangement, with a $1.2 billion tranche expected next month. The country narrowly avoided default in 2023.The report underscores that state capture and elite privilege—through tax exemptions, regulatory capture, and subsidies—remain systemic challenges. Implementing reforms, the IMF argues, could significantly restore economic growth, fiscal stability, and public trust.","Pakistan has turned to the IMF 25 times since 1958.

Five phases of cross-border terror: 1947–2025



Phase I (1947–1971): Foundational conflicts





Phase II (1972–1989): Proxy warfare





Phase III (1990–2000): Urban terror expands





Phase IV (2001–2009): National symbols targeted



Phase V (2010–2025): Adaptive terrorism and stronger Indian response



India’s resilience



NEW DELHI: A report released on Wednesday by NatStrat, a Delhi-based strategic affairs think tank, claims that Pakistan has used terrorism as a state instrument against India since 1947, with cross-border operations evolving through five distinct phases over nearly eight decades. The release coincided with the 17th anniversary of the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks.The study, titled ‘Chronology of Pakistani Terror Attacks on India: 1947–2025’, says records since Independence indicate a “consistent strategy” by Pakistan’s military and intelligence establishment, particularly the inter-services intelligence (ISI), to deploy terrorism as part of its policy framework.""The history of Pakistan-sponsored terrorism against India needs to be told and retold,"" the NatStrat compilation states.The report categorises the trajectory of Pakistan-origin terrorism into five periods - foundational conflicts (1947–71), the rise of proxy warfare (1972–89), escalation and urban attacks (1990–2000), targeting national symbols (2001–09), and adaptive terrorism with hardened Indian responses (2010–25).The period begins with the Poonch uprising and the tribal invasion of Jammu & Kashmir in 1947–48, followed by Operation Gibraltar (1965) and Operation Chengiz KhanPakistan’s pre-emptive strike in 1971.India’s counteroffensive culminated in the surrender of 93,000 Pakistani troops and the creation of Bangladesh.The report recounts plane hijackings, targeted killings - including the 1984 murder of diplomat Ravindera Mhatre - and ISI backing the Khalistan movement. The hijackings of Indian Airlines flights in 1971 and 1984 are cited as early examples of Pakistan’s covert strategy.Pakistan-backed groups, including Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), escalated militancy in J&K through the K2 project. Major urban attacks included the 1993 Mumbai serial blasts, 1996 Lajpat Nagar blast, 1998 Coimbatore bombings, the 1999 Kargil intrusion, and the IC-814 hijacking.Key attacks in this era include the 2001 Parliament attack, 2002 Akshardham temple assault, the 2005 Delhi blasts, 2006 Mumbai train bombings, and the 26/11 Mumbai attacks, which killed 166 and brought India-Pakistan ties to a breaking point.The report tracks attacks like the 2010 German Bakery blast, 2016 Pathankot and Uri attacks, and 2019 Pulwama bombing. It also lists recent incidents, including the 2025 Pahalgam attack, claimed by ‘The Resistance Front,’ and India’s retaliatory Operation Sindoor , which defence minister Rajnath Singh described as treating “any attack on Indian soil as an act of war.”The report stresses that cross-border terror has not deterred India’s progress. ""They have not stopped India's march as a nation. Instead, Indian society and polity have pushed back attempts to divide the country or slow down its progress,"" it notes.Calling terrorism an affront to humanity, the report says state-backed terrorism poses a grave threat to global stability.""It is a scourge that affects the whole world and must be fought unitedly, without reservation or double standards.""NatStrat is convened by Pankaj Saran, a former diplomat with four decades of experience, who has served in the prime minister’s office, national security council secretariat, and as India’s envoy to Russia and Bangladesh.

In September, the Pakistan Army conducted a training launch of the newly developed Fatah-4 — a ground-launched cruise missile with a range of 750 kilometres.The ISPR has described the Fatah-4 as equipped with advanced avionics and navigational aids and capable of evading missile-defence systems through low-altitude, terrain-hugging flight, ensuring high-precision strikes.India’s political and military leadership have repeatedly warned Pakistan of consequences “more serious than during Operation Sindoor"" - the four-day conflict - in the event of any “misadventure” by the neighbouring country.","Pakistan has been stepping up efforts to expand its defence capabilities since the May conflict with India.

NEW DELHI: Direct flights between Pakistan and Bangladesh will start next month, marking a significant boost to connectivity between the two countries, Bangladesh’s ambassador to Pakistan announced on Wednesday.There have been no direct air links for several years between the two, which were part of one country - Pakistan - until 1971. Bangladesh — formerly East Pakistan — became independent after the India-Pakistan war of December 1971. Bilateral relations, long shaped by this history, have begun to improve notably since the 2024 ouster of then-Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.“Mahan Air will begin operating three weekly flights between Dhaka and Karachi from next month,” Bangladesh’s High Commissioner to Pakistan, Iqbal Hussain Khan said. Dhaka is Bangladesh’s capital and largest city, while Karachi is Pakistan’s biggest metropolis; both rank among the world’s most populated urban centres.Khan did not specify the exact launch date or share further operational details.He also highlighted that the visa process has been simplified. “Visas are now being issued on the joint recommendation of Lahore Chamber of Commerce & Industry (LCCI) and the Bangladesh Honorary Consulate in Lahore,” he noted.Travellers can expect visas within three to four days, he added, describing the change as a step that will make cross-border movement faster and more convenient.The envoy emphasised that the new air links “will be a significant leap in strengthening connectivity between the two countries.”Mahan Airlines, which operates as Mahan Air, is a privately owned Iranian carrier. In addition, two Pakistani private airlines — Fly Jinnah and AirSial — have already received approval from Bangladesh’s aviation authorities to commence direct flights.Khan also disclosed that a direct cargo shipping service will be launched soon. “Although a cargo service has been operational since last December, rising trade volumes now demand a dedicated direct route,” he explained.Relations between the two countries have warmed in recent months. Following the August 5, 2024 ouster of Sheikh Hasina amid widespread student-led protests, and the appointment of Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus as Chief Adviser of the interim government, Dhaka and Islamabad have increased engagement across multiple fronts."," direct flights between Pakistan and Bangladesh will start next month. There have been no direct air links for several years between the two, which were part of one country - Pakistan - until 1971. Bilateral relations have begun to improve notably since the 2024 ouster of then-Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125586104,imgsize-34538,width-400,resizemode-4/flight.jpg"

TL;DR Driving the news

'Necessary Response At Proper Time': Taliban Vows Action After 10 Killed In Pak Strikes

What changed: The 27th Amendment





Passed in five days without broad consultation, the amendment:

Created a new Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) - removing constitutional jurisdiction from the Supreme Court.

Gave the president power to transfer judges - effectively coercing judicial loyalty.

Handed lifetime immunity to the president and military chiefs - beyond the reach of courts.

Eliminated the post of Chairman Joint Chiefs and established a Chief of Defence Forces - placing all services under Field Marshal Asim Munir.

Why it matters





A civilian-military consolidation of power unseen since the days of General Pervez Musharraf.

The official death of judicial independence, according to resigning justices and legal experts.

A reshuffling of Pakistan's political DNA - where the army writes the script, judges act the scenes, and a veiled mystic, Bushra Bibi , remains a ghost in the wings.

, remains a ghost in the wings. “We are facing completely uncharted territory,” warned constitutional lawyer Asad Rahim Khan.

The big picture: A triangle of power





Field Marshal Asim Munir: commander of all armed services, architect of the new order.

Imran Khan: jailed, disqualified, but symbolically invincible.

Bushra Bibi: spiritual advisor-turned-political wife, whose journey from Pakpattan to Islamabad may yet reshape the battlefield.

Together - or more accurately, against each other - they define Pakistan’s struggle between civilian populism, military dominance, and spiritual mysticism.

The new triumvirate: The general, the pirni & the cricketer





Asim Munir: The new pharaoh

All armed services via the new title Chief of Defence Forces

The nuclear command (transferred from civilians)

His own legal protection, via lifetime immunity

Parliament, by proxy of pliant coalitions

“Field marshals don't retire. They may leave a post, but they remain field marshal for life.” Shuja Nawaz on Munir

Imran Khan: Popularity in captivity





His party, despite rigging, won 93 out of 266 seats in 2024 elections.

His speeches are censored, yet his words circulate like sacred scripture.

His rivals - from Shehbaz Sharif to Zardari - struggle to match his moral authority.

Bushra Bibi: The mystic in the mirror





Predicted Khan’s rise to power - prompting their 2018 secret marriage.

Selected cabinet appointments by reading photographs.

The ISI angle





Bushra behind bars





Unlawful marriage (violating the Islamic waiting period)

Saudi gifts corruption scandal

Land deal redirection for an Islamic university

Yet none of these - even when supported by leaked audios and courtroom theatrics - have cracked public perception.

“Bushra has not made herself my weakness,” Khan said from his cell. “Her bravery has made me stronger.”

Between the lines





This is not just a crisis of governance - it’s a recasting of Pakistan’s founding vision.

From constitutional democracy to executive-military command

From judicial review to judicial obedience

From public representation to spiritual symbolism

What’s next





Munir had been due to retire in 2027. Now, he is set to oversee the 2028 elections, installing loyalist judges and neutering opposition.

What if Khan compromises - freeing himself and Bushra in exchange for political silence.

Then there is the risk of popular backlash erupting-driven by youth, lawyers, and civil society.

For now, the regime holds the cards. But as with every overreach in Pakistan’s history - from Zia to Musharraf - backlash often comes not as revolution, but as decay.

Bottom line





The Field Marshal cannot be arrested

The Supreme Court cannot speak

The President cannot be questioned

And the people’s vote barely matters





On paper, the 27th Constitutional Amendment is 59 clauses of dense legalese. In practice, it reads like a character study of three people: a jailed former cricket hero, his mystic wife, and a general-turned-field marshal who now enjoys lifetime immunity.On November 14, 2025, Pakistan enacted the 27th Constitutional Amendment - a sweeping legal overhaul that granted lifetime immunity to President Asif Ali Zardari and Field Marshal Asim Munir , while transforming the judiciary into an executive-led structure.Two Supreme Court judges resigned. Opposition parties stormed out of Parliament. And somewhere in a prison cell in Adiala, Imran Khan , Pakistan’s most popular politician, began writing a letter - alone, without books or newspapers.“Parliament has done what previous dictators could only dream of,” said legal analyst Mirza Moiz Baig.“This is autocratic legalism,” warned Aqil Shah of Georgetown University. “In no other democracy is the army chief of staff the designated joint service chief,” Shah told AFP.The 27th Amendment isn’t just constitutional tinkering. It represents:In a scathing editorial, Dawn argued that “with this, the separation of powers and basic structure established by the 1973 Constitution of Pakistan - which envisioned an independent judiciary and armed forces subservient to the civilian dispensation - now stands terminated.”It noted the irony that “instead of the military, an independent judiciary has been amended away into a subservient department of the executive branch. ”“The funeral rites for the judiciary have been performed,” said the editorial.Pakistan’s new regime is no longer about parties. It’s now a triumvirate:Munir rose through the ranks as quartermaster general and Corps Commander Gujranwala, then as head of Military Intelligence and, eventually, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). In 2019 he was removed as intelligence chief “just eight months into his stint, under then-prime minister Imran Khan and for reasons that have never been made public.”That sacking is widely seen in Pakistan as the first major clash between Munir and Imran Khan.Now elevated to Field Marshal, Asim Munir controls:“He probably has as much power as Musharraf,” said military analyst Shuja Nawaz. “Like Musharraf, he has a subservient prime minister and the authority to reshape the army's structure,” Nawaz told AFP.And unlike Musharraf, Munir doesn’t wear the scars of a military coup - he wears constitutional legitimacy.Former Prime Minister Imran Khan - held in solitary confinement, his party symbol banned, and facing dozens of legal cases - still commands unmatched national support.“He is still seen as Pakistan’s moral sovereign,” noted a leading historian.But behind bars, choices are narrowing. Some in PTI want compromise. Bushra Bibi, too, is reportedly inclined toward negotiation.As per a profile of Bushra Bibi in the Economist, by the mid-2010s, Imran Khan was at a personal and political low. Then came the introduction to Bushra Manika, a middle-aged woman from Punjab with a reputation as a Sufi-inclined spiritual guide. Their relationship began with late-night phone calls, before turning into visits to her family home in Pakpattan. According to 1843, Bushra’s then-husband, Khawar Manika, initially enjoyed the glamour but became uneasy as his wife’s intimacy with Khan grew. He recalled asking: “Why can’t we sit together?” and described walking into rooms to find conversations abruptly cut short.Manika later told 1843 that his wife had shared a prophecy with Khan: if they married, he would become prime minister. She divorced Manika at the end of 2017 and married Khan in a secret ceremony on January 1st 2018. Khan later told a British newspaper, “Sufism is an order with many levels, but I have never met anyone who is as high as my wife.”As per the Economist, few first ladies in modern history have combined veiled mysticism, political access, and whispered intrigue quite like Bushra Bibi.Once a pirni from Pakpattan, she:“Her interference was absolute,” a member of Imran Khan’s cabinet told the Economist.“He cannot see beyond that Sufi halo she carries around her,” added close friend Salman Ahmad.Per the Economist’s reporting, ISI officers allegedly used a pir to funnel intelligence to Bushra, who then passed it to Khan as revelations from dreams - reinforcing her mystical power and his trust in her.“Faiz was feeding information to Bushra Bibi through her pir,” confirmed ex-ally Faisal Vawda.“That’s how Khan started getting blinded.”But what the spy agency built, it later dismantled. When Khan sacked Asim Munir as ISI chief in 2019, allegedly after he raised corruption concerns about Bushra, the seeds of retaliation were planted.Bushra Bibi now shares Khan’s fate - imprisoned, silenced, and at the center of three separate cases:“No ordinary Pakistani will remain unaffected,” Dawn warned.“When the state is tried by a court that it has hand-picked, the citizen will lose every time.”This crisis leaves Pakistan at a crossroads:This isn’t just about one amendment, or one general, or one mystic wife. It’s about a state remade in secret, then rubber-stamped in Parliament, where:But still, whispers from prison echo across Pakistan - from Khan’s letters to Bushra’s mysticism and protests.(With inputs from agencies)",The 27th Amendment to Pakistan's constitution was passed in five days without broad consultation.

Suicide Bombers Storm Pakistan’s FC Headquarters In Peshawar As Explosions Rock High-Security Zone





A coordinated attack involving suicide bombers and gunmen targeted the headquarters of the Federal Constabulary (FC) paramilitary force in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Peshawar on Monday. Rebel group Jamaat-ul-Ahrar (JuA) has claimed responsibility for the attack. While the group claimed around two dozen casualties and death of three of its fighters, Pakistani authorities said there were six deaths, including that of three soldiers.The JuA, which is comprised of soldiers from Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), was also behind the suicide bombing at a judicial complex in Islamabad a day after the blast in Delhi. Monday's operation began with a suicide bomber detonating explosives at the main entrance of the highly secured FC headquarters, a compound located in a densely populated area on Sunehri Masjid Road in Peshawar Cantonment.Following the initial blast, at least two other attackers breached the premises and engaged security forces, sources said. Several personnel and civilians were also reported injured and rushed to nearby hospitals.Over two dozen people were admitted for treatment.Peshawar capital city police officer Mian Saeed Ahmad told local media that the three personnel killed were stationed at the main gate. Ahmad claimed that the quick response of security forces resulted in the timely elimination of the remaining two attackers, preventing a potentially high casualty count as a large number of personnel were reportedly gathered inside for parade drills.A representative of JuA posted on Telegram about the attack, saying: ""Three suicide mujahideen are participating in the attack. We want the complete and 100% implementation of Sharia. If the enemy agrees to 99% but refuses even 1%, then our jihad against them will continue. Insha'Allah...""The JuA split from TTP in 2014 due to ideological differences. However, it joined hands with TTP again a few years ago.

How it unfolded



Rise in militant attacks







Pakistan’s northwestern city of Peshawar witnessed a major security breach on Monday morning when suicide bombers targeted the headquarters of the Federal Constabulary (FC), a paramilitary force stationed in a densely populated area near the military cantonment. The assault left at least three FC personnel dead and several others injured, prompting a large-scale operation to clear the compound and secure the neighbourhood.Police and rescue officials confirmed that the attackers struck just after 8am, hitting the main entrance before attempting to push further inside. According to senior officers, the security response prevented a mass-casualty event, especially as dozens of FC personnel were gathered on the parade ground at the time.Officials said the assault began when one suicide bomber blew himself up at the main gate. “The first suicide bomber first carried out an attack on the main entrance of the constabulary and the other one entered the compound,” a senior official told Reuters.Police Chief Saeed Ahmad said one attacker detonated his explosives at the main gate, while the second bomber was shot dead near the parking area. He confirmed that several terrorists were on foot and attempting to reach the parade ground.“The terrorists involved in today's attack were on foot and failed to reach the parade area and a timely response by our forces prevented a much larger tragedy,” he told AP.Other security officials reported that three militants in total attempted to storm the complex. “One attacker detonated himself at the main gate of the FC Headquarters, while two others managed to enter the premises,” CCPO Dr Mian Saeed said, adding that both were killed in the ensuing gun battle. The FC immediately cordoned off the area, diverted traffic and launched a sweeping search operation.Hospital officials confirmed that at least five people, including FC personnel and civilians, were injured. Emergency measures were declared at Lady Reading Hospital and Khyber Teaching Hospital, where all the wounded were reported to be in stable condition.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the assault, saying “Timely action taken by security forces saved us from major harm,” while President Asif Ali Zardari warned that “externally backed Fitna-al-Khawarij cannot weaken Pakistan’s unity, resilience or resolve”.No group claimed responsibility, but the incident comes amid a sharp rise in militant attacks since the Pakistani Taliban (TTP) ended a ceasefire in 2022. Islamabad has repeatedly accused the TTP of operating from Afghan soil—an allegation Kabul denies.Monday’s bombing marks the second major attack on a security installation in Peshawar in recent years, following the 2023 Police Lines mosque blast that killed 84 people. Security forces have since intensified operations in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, where attacks on military and police units have surged.",Suicide bombers targeted the headquarters of the Federal Constabulary (FC) in Peshawar.

Ex-CIA Reveals Savage Reply To Imran Khan’s PTI After Apology Demand Over His India-Pak War Analysis





Former CIA officer John Kiriakou -- who once headed the agency’s counterterrorism operations in Pakistan -- said Pakistani officials sent him a letter demanding an apology for his remark that India would defeat Pakistan in a conventional war.Reacting to the letter on the podcast of internet personality Julian Dorey, Kiriakou used blunt language as he mocked former Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan and his party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) for the demand of apology.Kiriakou has recently made a series of striking claims in an interview with ANI news agency, including that the White House had expected “India to strike back after the 2001 and 2008 attacks.” He also recounted how Osama bin Laden escaped from the Tora Bora mountains into Pakistan.Kiriakou was speaking about the 2001 Parliament attack in New Delhi, carried out by Pakistan-backed Jaish-e-Mohammad, and the 2008 Mumbai attacks launched by Lashkar-e-Taiba, another Pakistan-nurtured terror outfit. The United States itself had suffered a devastating blow just months before India’s Parliament attack -- the 9/11 strikes by Osama bin Laden–led Al-Qaeda on the World Trade Center in New York.Recalling the events at Tora Bora, Kiriakou said American forces had cornered Bin Laden in the mountains as heavy bombing continued. “We knew we had Bin Laden cornered. We told him to come down the mountain,” he said. Bin Laden asked for time until dawn, claiming he needed to evacuate women and children.“But then,” Kiriakou said, “Osama bin Laden dressed as a woman and escaped under the cover of darkness in the back of a pickup truck into Pakistan.”Kiriakou also claimed the US had effectively “purchased” Pakistan’s then-president Pervez Musharraf . He said this after remarking that “the United States loves working with dictators.” According to him, Washington paid “tens of millions of dollars in cash to the Pakistani intelligence service.”Speaking about the attacks on India, he said, “The Indian government would have been perfectly within its rights to respond by striking Pakistan.” He added: “At the White House, we expected the Indians to strike back and they did not.”He then went further, making an explosive assertion about Pakistan’s nuclear weapons. “In 2002, I was told, unofficially, that the Pentagon controlled Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal,” Kiriakou said.And in a blunt assessment of the military balance between the two neighbours, he stated: “Pakistan cannot win a conventional war against India.”","Former CIA officer John Kiriakou said Pakistani officials sent him a letter demanding an apology for his remark that India would defeat Pakistan in a conventional war.

At least 15 workers were killed and seven others injured on Friday after a boiler exploded at a glue-making factory in Faisalabad, eastern Pakistan, authorities said. Police reported that the factory manager had been arrested, while the owner fled the scene shortly after the blast.The explosion occurred at the industrial unit in Punjab province, severely damaging the building and triggering a fire that spread panic across the neighbourhood. Local administrator Raja Jahangir said the cause of the blast was being investigated and confirmed that nearby homes had also been affected.Police official Mohammad Aslam said an investigation was underway to determine what led to the boiler failure. Pakistan Punjab chief minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif expressed condolences to the families of the victims and directed officials to provide the best possible medical care to the injured.Industrial accidents remain common in Pakistan, where poor safety standards often contribute to fatal incidents.

5.7-magnitude earthquake in Bangladesh triggers tremors across Kolkata, northeast





An earthquake of magnitude 5.2 struck Pakistan in the early hours of Friday, according to the National Centre for Seismology (NCS). The agency said the quake occurred at a depth of 135 kilometres, with tremors recorded at 03:09:12 IST.In a post on X, the NCS said, “EQ of M: 5.2, On: 21/11/2025 03:09:12 IST, Lat: 36.12 N, Long: 71.51 E, Depth: 135 Km, Location: Pakistan.” Officials said more information is awaited.The NCS also shared details of another recent tremor. On Thursday, a magnitude 3.9 earthquake struck Pakistan at a shallow depth of 10 kilometres, making the region susceptible to aftershocks. The agency posted: “EQ of M: 3.9, On: 20/11/2025 17:19:20 IST, Lat: 35.02 N, Long: 71.63 E, Depth: 10 Km, Location: Pakistan.”Earlier on November 10, an earthquake of magnitude 3.6 was recorded at 02:42 AM at a depth of 90 kilometres. The NCS said on X, “EQ of M: 3.6, On: 10/11/2025 02:42:55 IST, Lat: 35.20 N, Long: 73.40 E, Depth: 90 Km, Location: Pakistan.”Seismologists note that shallow earthquakes are generally more dangerous because seismic waves have less distance to travel, resulting in stronger ground shaking and greater potential damage.Pakistan lies in one of the world’s most seismically active zones, where the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates collide. The region frequently experiences moderate to strong earthquakes, often felt across borders in Afghanistan and northern India.Multiple provinces lie close to major fault lines. Balochistan sits near the active boundary between the Arabian and Eurasian plates. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan fall along the southern edge of the Eurasian plate, while Punjab and Sindh are positioned on the northwestern edge of the Indian plate, making large parts of the country vulnerable to frequent seismic activity.","The quake occurred at a depth of 135 kilometres, with tremors recorded at 03:09:12 IST.

(With inputs from agencies)





Pakistan’s judiciary is in a moment of crisis as senior judges resign amid a contentious constitutional amendment reshapes the balance of power in favour of the military. Behind the crisis is the contentious 27th Constitutional Amendment, a sweeping package pushed through parliament within days. Lawyers, judges and opposition parties argue that it has weakened the courts and elevated the military’s top commander to a position with no modern parallel.Since then, Pakistan’s judiciary has been hit by a series of high-profile resignations. On Saturday, Lahore High Court judge Shams Mehmood Mirza stepped down, and his family said his decision was directly linked to the 27th Amendment. His departure followed those of Supreme Court justices Mansoor Ali Shah and Athar Minallah, who issued sharply worded letters condemning the amendment as a direct attack on judicial independence.The creation of a new Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) lies at the heart of judicial restructuring. The FCC now holds exclusive jurisdiction over constitutional matters, stripping the Supreme Court of its original powers. Pending petitions have already been shifted to the new court. President Zardari swore in Justice Aminuddin Khan as its first chief justice; six other judges were appointed, including serving Supreme Court and high court judges, though one judge reportedly refused to join.The FCC’s establishment has sparked intense concern. Critics say the president’s new power to transfer judges risks becoming a tool to sideline dissenting voices. Opposition groups argue this will fundamentally weaken judicial independence and concentrate constitutional authority in the executive and military leadership.Government ministers, however, hailed the package as “historic” and a step toward greater efficiency and national unity. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said the amendment proved that “solidarity” prevailed during a time of national strain.With judges resigning, courts being reconfigured, and the military gaining unprecedented constitutional control, Pakistan faces a moment of reckoning.The amendment passed with overwhelming numbers in both houses has dramatically restructured Pakistan’s defence architecture, elevating army chief Asim Munir to Chief of Defence Forces with command over all three military branches. His five-year tenure now resets from the date of notification, enabling him to remain in office until 2030.The Senate has since rushed through four related bills, including amendments to the Army, Air Force and Navy Acts, along with changes to Supreme Court practice rules. These laws remove the earlier equality among service chiefs and replace references to the Joint Chiefs of Staff system with a new “National Strategic Command”, further centralising military authority under Munir.Dawn reported that appointments, extensions, and tenures under these reforms “shall not be called into question before any court on any ground whatsoever”.Experts quoted in multiple reports warn that the shift risks internal military tensions and further erodes civilian oversight. Lawyer Osama Malik described the reforms as something “usually granted in absolute monarchies”, arguing they grant lifetime protections not only to Munir but also to President Zardari.Opposition lawmakers responded with uproar, shredding copies of the bill and walking out. PTI leaders labelled the move “deeply undemocratic” and “the final nail in the coffin of an independent judiciary”. Critics say these changes could reshape the political landscape, particularly for nearly 200 cases involving former prime minister Imran Khan.","Pakistan's judiciary is in a moment of crisis as senior judges resign amid a contentious constitutional amendment. The amendment reshapes the balance of power in favour of the military. Lawyers, judges and opposition parties argue that it has weakened the courts and elevated the military’s top commander.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125346032,imgsize-697824,width-400,resizemode-4/asim-munir-file-photo.jpg"

“Being Examined”: MEA On Dhaka’S Request To Extradite Sheikh Hasina

Direct flights between Pak and B'desh from Dec





DHAKA: Anti-corruption authorities in Bangladesh have seized about 10 kilograms of gold worth about $1.3 million from bank lockers belonging to ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina , officials aware of development said Wednesday.Officials from the Central Intelligence Cell (CIC) of the national board of revenue said the discovery was made after opening lockers that had been seized in Sept. ""Following a court order, we opened the lockers and found about 9.7 kilograms of gold belonging to the former prime minister,"" a CIC official said, requesting anonymity. The haul included gold coins, bars and jewellery.Investigators said Hasina had failed to deposit some of the gifts she received while in office at the state treasury, known as ""Toshakhana"", as required by law. The national board of revenue is also probing alleged tax evasion and examining whether the former prime minister declared the recovered gold in her tax filings.Direct flights between Pakistan and Bangladesh will begin from next month, a significant leap in strengthening connectivity between the two countries, Dhaka's top diplomat said Wednesday. There has been no direct flight between Pakistan and Bangladesh for the last several years.

'Necessary Response At Proper Time': Taliban Vows Action After 10 Killed In Pak Strikes





The overnight Pakistani air strikes in eastern Afghanistan that killed 10 civilians Tuesday prompted the Taliban government to vow it would respond “appropriately at the right time. ”“The Islamic Emirate strongly condemns this violation and crime and reiterates that defending its airspace, territory, and people is its legitimate right, and it will respond appropriately at the right time,” Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said on X.'Nothing comes to the forefront except the failure and disgrace of Pakistan's military regime,"" he added.Mujahid, in a previous stament, said nine of the victims were children — five boys and four girls — and one was a woman. “The Pakistani invading forces bombed the house of a local civilian resident... As a result, nine children (five boys and four girls) and one woman were martyred” in Khost province.Pakistan’s military and government did not immediately commente on the air strike allegations.Other strikes hit the border regions of Kunar and Paktika, injuring four more civilians, AFP reported citing Mujahid’s post.A day earlier, two suicide bombers and a gunman attacked the Federal Constabulary headquarters in Peshawar’s Saddar area, killing three officers and wounding 11.Security forces quickly neutralized the attackers. No group has claimed responsibility, though suspicion fell on the Pakistani Taliban, or Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, reported AP.Following the attacks, a Pakistani diplomat met with a senior Afghan provincial leader to discuss security concerns, just hours after the Peshawar bombing.The strikes follow cross-border clashes more than a month ago when Afghanistan claimed Pakistani drone strikes hit Kabul. A ceasefire brokered by Qatar and Turkey in October remains in place despite the latest reported strikes, with neither country issuing statements on the incident.Iran has also offered to play a role in easing tensions between the two neighbors.","Pakistani air strikes in eastern Afghanistan killed 10 civilians Tuesday.

NEW DELHI: A 5.5-magnitude earthquake struck central Bangladesh on Friday, killing at least six people and injuring several, AP reported citing officials. The quake, which shook buildings in Dhaka and sent residents fleeing outdoors, was felt across several parts of the country and in neighbouring regions of India including Kolkata.Also read: West Bengal: Strong tremors jolt Kolkata; no damage reported yet The US Geological Survey said the earthquake occurred at 10:38 am, with the epicentre located in the Ghorashal area of Narsingdi district, about 25 kilometres from Dhaka, at a depth of 10 kilometres. Dhaka-based DBC Television reported that six people died in the capital, including three who were killed when a roof and a wall collapsed, and three pedestrians who were struck by falling building railings.Authorities said the tremors caused significant panic in Dhaka, one of the world’s most densely populated cities with more than 30,000 people per square kilometre. Bangladesh’s central region is typically less seismically active than the north and southeast, where interactions between the India and Eurasia plates make earthquakes more common.A separate update from ANI said a 5.5-magnitude quake near Narsingdi was felt widely across Dhaka around 10:40 am and also in parts of India including West Bengal and areas of the northeast.The USGS recorded the event at 10:08 am IST. As per the ANI report, “There have been no reports of casualties or damage so far,” though later official updates confirmed fatalities in the capital.Last month, Bangladesh recorded a magnitude 3.4 earthquake, according to the National Centre for Seismology. Experts note that shallow earthquakes can produce stronger surface shaking because seismic waves travel a shorter distance.Citing USGS figures, The Daily Star reported that a magnitude 4.0 earthquake releases energy equivalent to about 6 tons of TNT, while a magnitude 5.0 quake corresponds to around 200 tons. The energy rises steeply with each magnitude, with a 7.0 quake equalling nearly 199,000 tons of TNT and a 9.0 quake releasing about 99 million tons, comparable to roughly 25,000 nuclear bombs.Bangladesh sits at the junction of the Indian, Eurasian and Burma plates, which move several centimetres each year. The country is intersected by major faults including the Bogura, Tripura, Shillong Plateau, Dauki and Assam faults, placing it within 13 recognised earthquake-prone zones. Regions such as Chattogram, the Chattogram Hill Tracts and Jaintiapur in Sylhet fall within the highest-risk category.Visuals from Dhaka on Friday showed emergency teams assessing damage as authorities monitored aftershocks and structural impacts across the capital.(With inputs from AP and ANI)","A 5.5-magnitude earthquake struck central Bangladesh on Friday, killing at least six people.

'Eternally Grateful': Sheikh Hasina's Son Thanks PM Modi For Saving His Mother's Life, Slams Yunus





Ousted Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina ’s son, Sajeeb Wazed, on Thursday alleged that country's interim leader Muhammad Yunus would not be able to harm his mother. He insisted that “Yunus cannot touch my mother and he cannot do anything to her.”His remarks come at a time when Hasina’s future hangs in the balance after a tribunal in Bangladesh sentenced her to death over alleged involvement in the deadly student-led uprising of 2024. The tribunal linked her to the violent crackdown that preceded her ouster. Chief adviser and interim leader Bangladesh, Muhammad Yunus welcomed the verdict, insisting that no one is above the law.Speaking to IANS, Wazed said: “They will not be able to kill her, but they will execute the verdict. First of all, they can’t get her. And once there is a rule of law, this entire process will get thrown out. Everything here is so illegal and unconstitutional and violates every legal principle that, once there is rule of law, everything will get thrown out and it will not be sustainable. So, Yunus cannot touch my mother, and he cannot do anything to her. ”Launching a sharp attack on Bangladesh’s extradition request, Sajeeb Wazed thanked India for protecting Hasina’s life.He also reacted to calls for Yunus’ Nobel Peace Prize to be revoked amid allegations of rights abuses under the interim administration. “Well, Nobel committees never take back their prizes. But look at Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi in Myanmar. She won the Nobel Prize as well. The Peace Prize is basically given by lobbying. But she led to Rohingyas getting killed, and now Yunus is turning Bangladesh into a failed state and an Islamist terrorist state,” he said.Asked what the Congress party in India might have done if it had been in power, the Indian-origin politician replied: “The Congress party would have done the exact same thing that the present government has done. In India, there is rule of law and you have constitutional process. You people have always followed the Constitution and laws.”Wazed sharply criticised the trial process that ended in Hasina’s death sentence, calling it entirely illegal. “This has been done completely illegally. It’s a mockery. First of all, there is a government that is unelected, unconstitutional, and illegal. Then, in order to fast-track the trial in the tribunals, they had to amend laws, which you can only amend with a Parliament. Currently, there is no Parliament. So the process itself was completely illegal. They terminated 17 judges on this tribunal and appointed a new judge who has no experience. He has publicly made a nasty comment about my mother. So he is clearly biased.”He accused authorities of denying Hasina her right to legal representation. “They have not allowed my mother to appoint any lawyer. They appointed their own lawyers to defend my mother. In the history of Bangladesh, such trials take years of hearings, but they completed this in 140 days. So, it’s a complete mockery of justice. There has been no due process. This is a joke,” he added.The ruling marks one of the most consequential legal decisions against a former Bangladeshi leader in decades and comes months before national elections expected in early February. Hasina, 78, has refused to return from India for the trial. The court examined allegations that she ordered a violent response to the mass student uprising that eventually forced her out of power in August 2024.The former prime minister -- Bangladesh’s longest-serving leader -- is facing multiple charges stemming from the period of unrest. A UN rights office report estimated that up to 1,400 people were killed between July 15 and August 15 during the “July Uprising,” which followed a sweeping security crackdown ordered by her government.",Sheikh Hasina's son Sajeeb Wazed slams interim leader Muhammad Yunus.

Nepal Gen Z Protest EXPLODES For 2nd Time, Curfew Imposed, Cops Use LETHAL Force | Watch





Gen Z demonstrators returned to the streets of Nepal’s Bara district on Thursday, reigniting tensions for a second straight day as clashes with police broke out early in the morning.With unrest intensifying in Simara, local authorities imposed a curfew from 1.00 pm to 8.00 pm (local time) in an effort to contain the situation after Wednesday’s confrontation between the youths and CPN-UML cadres.""Curfew has been reimposed following the clash with the police to bring the situation under control,"" assistant chief district officer Chhabiraman Subedi was quoted as saying by ANI.Tensions in Bara have been escalating since Wednesday, after UML (Unified Marxist Leninist) leaders prepared to visit the district ahead of the March 5, 2026 elections. The unrest has raised concerns among experts, who point to the fragile security situation, with hundreds of inmates still at large and a comparable number of weapons missing following the September uprising.The situation intensified when Gen Z supporters were injured in a confrontation at Simara Chowk near the airport, prompting the group to file a complaint against six UML cadres.Gen Z leader Samrat Upadhyay, 21, a resident of Simara in Bara, said that a group of 10–12 youths had gathered peacefully when CPN-UML cadres allegedly attacked them, leaving seven injured, including himself.""Thus, our demand is simple – arrest Mahesh Basnet and UML cadres who launched a brutal attack on us today, injuring at least seven of us. Bara will remain close until our demands are met,"" Upadhyay was quoted as saying by The Himalayan Times.Police later detained Ward Chair Dhan Bahadur Shrestha of Ward 2 and Ward Chair Kaimudin Ansari of Ward 6 of Jeetpursimara Sub-metropolitan City in connection with the earlier clashes.As violence escalated near Simara Airport, police fired tear gas to disperse protestors, leading authorities to temporarily suspend airport operations.The agitated Gen Z protesters have accused the police of failing to apprehend those named in their complaint related to Wednesday’s clash. Sushila Karki , the former chief justice now serving as interim prime minister following the September uprising, urged all political actors to “refrain from unwanted political provocation” and place their trust in the democratic process ahead of the March 5, 2026 elections.In a statement issued late Wednesday, Karki said, “I have directed the Home Administration and security agencies to work with utmost restraint and preparation to maintain peace and order.”She added that her priority is to “ensure the safe movement of leaders of all political parties, and create a fair and fear-free environment for the elections.”Nepal remains in a fragile political transition following the September regime change, when nationwide protests forced then–prime minister and UML chairman KP Oli to resign.The two-day uprising left 76 people dead across the country. What began as anger over a government-imposed social media ban quickly expanded into a wider revolt driven by years of economic stagnation and entrenched corruption in the nation of 30 million.Demonstrators torched parliament, courts and government offices, ultimately toppling the 73-year-old four-time premier. Karki, also 73, was appointed interim prime minister to guide the country toward fresh elections.","Nepal Gen Z Protest EXPLODES For 2nd Time, Curfew Imposed, Cops Use LETHAL Force.

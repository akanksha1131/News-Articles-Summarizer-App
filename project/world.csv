Is Emiru coming back to Twitch? What we know about her return after the drama,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us-streamers/is-emiru-coming-back-to-twitch-what-we-know-about-her-return-after-the-drama/articleshow/124839909.cms,"Emiru (Image credit: IG/X)

Emiru’s uncertain future on Twitch as fans wait for her next move

The TwitchCon 2025 assault that left Emiru shaken and the internet demanding answers

Twitch under fire for failing its creators and vowing to rebuild trust after the backlash

From public silence to powerful accusations — Emiru’s explosive claims against Mizkif





Emiru, one of Twitch’s most recognizable faces, has stayed out of the streaming spotlight since October 2025 — the month that changed everything. Following her shocking assault at TwitchCon and her explosive accusations against fellow streamer Mizkif, the question fans keep asking is the same: Will she ever return to Twitch? For now, her future on the platform remains uncertain.So far, Emiru hasn’t commented on whether she will return to Twitch. Her focus appears to be on healing and handling the ongoing legal matters surrounding both the assault and her accusations against Mizkif. Millions of fans continue to await updates, hoping for a sign that she’ll eventually return to streaming. Until then, the question of Emiru’s comeback remains one of Twitch’s most closely watched mysteries.What began as a cheerful meet-and-greet turned into a nightmare when a male attendee breached security and assaulted Emiru on stage. The disturbing moment, caught on video, spread rapidly across social media and drew outrage from fans and fellow creators alike. Event security intervened within seconds, removing the man from the stage. Twitch later confirmed that he had been permanently banned from both the platform and all future events.The incident reignited discussions about streamer safety, with many calling for tighter security measures at conventions and live events.Twitch faced intense criticism for how it handled the situation. CEO Dan Clancy issued a public apology days later, admitting the company “failed” in its duty to protect creators like Emiru. He promised a full-scale review of the platform’s event security and moderation systems, saying, “We take creator safety very seriously, and we are committed to learning from this to ensure it never happens again.”Still, the apology did little to quiet the growing backlash, as creators accused Twitch of reacting too slowly and neglecting the emotional toll such incidents have on streamers.In the weeks following TwitchCon, Emiru publicly accused her former partner, Mizkif (Matthew Rinaudo), of sexual assault, emotional abuse, and blackmail. She revealed that she had stayed silent for months out of fear but decided to speak up after feeling unsafe. Emiru has since pursued restraining orders against Mizkif in both Texas and California and is pressing charges connected to the TwitchCon assault. Her revelations have sent shockwaves through the streaming community, exposing the darker realities of creator relationships behind the screens.Despite the chaos surrounding her, Emiru’s courage in coming forward has drawn both empathy and respect from fans worldwide. As she steps away to heal and rebuild, her story has sparked an overdue conversation about safety, accountability, and the unseen struggles behind online fame. Whether or not she returns to Twitch, Emiru’s voice has already made a lasting impact far beyond the platform.Also read: Who is Zoe Spencer?

Children at grave risk in Libya's camps



Over 3,500 minors reported dead or missing



Trump's USAID cuts have dramatic consequences



German government cuts funding for sea rescue







""No one would risk their life at sea if there were a better way. But there's no alternative. That's why we risk our lives.""These are the words of a 15-year-old boy from Guinea rescued as an unaccompanied minor at sea by the Berlin-based NGO, SOS Humanity.The organisation, which has been saving refugees and migrants at sea for the last decade, warns that more and more children and minors are setting out alone from Libya or Tunisia to Europe in overcrowded boats that are often not seaworthy. Around a fifth of those rescued have been minors.Esther, a German clinical psychologist, volunteered as a mental health officer on Mediterranean rescue missions in November and December 2024.During a press conference in Berlin on Tuesday, where Esther did not give her surname, she said that during her time at sea six boats carrying 347 people were rescued. Among them were 43 young people, mostly unaccompanied minors, in poor physical and mental health.""They'd often been at sea without food or drink for several days and nights, were dehydrated, seasick and often had burns from fuel and salt water. Many also had scabies or other infections and wounds, because they had been held in camps in Libya for long periods.All of them were emotionally exhausted,"" she said.Conditions in Libyan detention camps, where those intercepted by the the country's coast guard are returned after failed attempts to cross the Mediterranean, are catastrophic, especially for young people.For years, Libya: which, under a multimillion-euro agreement with the European Union , is meant to take over border control and drastically reduce migrant numbers, has faced intense criticism for serious human rights violations.""Young people told me about extreme sexual violence, torture, child labor, losing relatives and cases of human trafficking involving women,"" Esther recounted. ""Some of these young people showed me physical evidence of what they've been through. Some had scars from torture, as well as photos and videos taken at the Libyan camps showing them tied up and beaten.""Minors who manage to escape from the camps face even greater danger during the crossing.According to Unicef estimates from April, around 3,500 children have died or disappeared in the last 10 years while attempting to reach Italy via the central Mediterranean route. That means nearly one dead or missing child per day for an entire decade.This statistic has SOS Humanity calling for an immediate end to the EU's cooperation with Libya and Tunisia.""The proportion of minors among those fleeing has actually been rising steadily over the last 10 years. Around one-fifth of all arrivals in Italy are minors. In our rescues, the average is even more than one-third,"" said Till Rummenhohl, managing director of SOS Humanity.""We recently had a whole boat of just minors, 120, on board. They were completely panicked young people who were traveling alone and jumped into the water out of fear of the Libyan coast guard,"" he added.The growing number of children and adolescents embarking on the dangerous journey to Europe may worsen in the future, warned Lanna Idriss, the head of SOS Children's Villages Worldwide. The reason: the US government under President Donald Trump has dissolved the development aid agency USAID, with dramatic consequences.In a study published this summer, the medical journal The Lancet calculated that USAID cuts could result in more than 14 million deaths globally over the next five years, including up to 5 million children under the age of 5. Germany has also cut its development aid by almost €1 billion ($1.2 billion).""We are entering a vicious cycle that will lead to more children taking this route,"" said Idriss, citing Somalia as an example. ""The country was 80% dependent on USAID. Last year, we reached 4.5 million children and adolescents in Somalia; this year, only 1.3 million. Why? Because the camps intended to support these children have been empty since the summer.""Vera Magali Keller heads a law firm in Berlin that specialises in supporting humanitarian organisations, including those that carry out sea rescues.Children and young people must be given priority protection and evacuation during sea rescues, the lawyer told DW, referring to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, to which all UN member states have committed themselves.""In several European countries, there are special prospects for obtaining residence, protection entitlements and rights to family reunification. In Italy, for example, these often apply until the age of legal adulthood. As a general rule, children and adolescents must be accommodated separately from adults and given special protection. Detention should be avoided wherever possible,"" said Keller.SOS Humanity has announced plans to deploy another rescue vessel in the Mediterranean in 2026. The ship will primarily operate off the coast of Tunisia, searching for migrant boats and monitoring human rights violations.To do this, the sea rescue organisation will rely on donations, as the German government has discontinued its annual €2 million funding for civilian sea rescue. This is one reason why Keller is pessimistic about the future.""Given the current political and legal developments, I don't see any positive prospects,"" she said. ""I fear that the criminalisation and repression of civilian sea rescue will intensify under the current coalition. The already disastrous protection and reception standards for refugees in Europe will likely continue to deteriorate.""","More and more children and minors are setting out alone from Libya or Tunisia to Europe in overcrowded boats that are often not seaworthy. Around a fifth of those rescued have been minors. Unicef estimates around 3,500 children have died or disappeared in the last 10 years while attempting to reach Italy via the central Mediterranean route.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124839916,imgsize-1387983,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"
Praise or taunt? Elon Musk calls Zohran Mamdani 'future of Democratic Party',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/praise-or-taunt-elon-musk-calls-zohran-mamdani-future-of-democratic-party-watch/articleshow/124838279.cms,"Elon Musk called Zohran Mamdano 'the future of Democratic Party' igniting debate about the Democratic Party's future. Governor Kathy Hochul's endorsement of Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist, drew criticism. Musk's remarks framed this as a leftward shift. Voters expressed concerns about Mamdani's agenda, with some calling it 'far-left' and others linking it to 'communism'.





Tesla CEO Elon Musk , in a brief but loaded X post, took a dig at the New York mayor socialist candidate Zohran Mamdani , calling him the ""future of the Democratic Party.""His words came as a reaction to New York’s governor endorsing Zohran Mamdani, naming the candidate as “a chance to reclaim the Senate and America” if elected. The comment, paired with a rally clip that has already garnered over 1.4 million views, quickly sparked a wave of speculation online. Was Musk applauding the move or slyly mocking it?In the video, Kathy Hochul can be seen urging the voters to vote for Zohran Mamdani to ""take back America."" The chants and signs at the rally called for rent freezes that cast Mamdani’s ascent as the party’s new face. The clip comes from an October 26 NYC rally featuring Hochul alongside Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders, where hecklers interjected with “tax the rich,” underscoring tensions between moderates and the left wing even as they share a stage for turnout energy.The tweet by Musk invited reactions castigating Mamdani's agenda as 'far-left.' While some critics framed the rent control and tax plans as steps toward “communism,” others argued the party’s post-2024 direction reflects an embrace of democratic socialism.The reply section was filled with analysis and memes indicating the voters' belief of Mamdani trying to 'push communist ideology on America.'One of the users also posted a meme of Mamdani posing against New York's grave.Another user wrote about their concern regarding New Yorkers losing their property to the mega investors and ending up owning nothing. ""Freeze rent. Increase property taxes and expenses. Force private owners to sell. All property is bought by mega investors. Every New Yorker will own nothing and like it,"" wrote the user.Elon Musk’s sharp comment turned what was meant to be a show of unity into a debate about the Democrats’ future, putting Governor Hochul’s practical stance and Mamdani’s progressive views in the same spotlight. As Election Day approaches, the key question is whether promises to make life more affordable can win against criticism over taxes and policing—and whether a viral remark can influence voters more than traditional campaigning.","Tesla CEO Elon Musk took a dig at the New York mayor socialist candidate Zohran Mamdani, calling him the 'future of the Democratic Party' The comment, paired with a rally clip that has already garnered over 1.4 million views, quickly sparked a wave of speculation online.

Milei's moment of truth



US bailout on the line







Argentines have voted in legislative elections viewed as a litmus test for President Javier Milei's free-market reforms and deep austerity measures.Turnout was 66%, according to provisional figures released by the national election chamber. If confirmed, this would be the lowest turnout in more than 40 years, according to Spain's EFE news agency.The president and his party, La Libertad Avanza, is looking to increase its small minority in congress which would make future reforms easier.Half of Argentina's lower chambers of deputies and a third of the Senate's seats are up for grabs in this legislative elections.Melei has faced several political blows since September with congress overturning laws introduced by him.The high-stakes midterm elections assume even more importance for Argentina's economy.US President Donald Trump , who recently provided Argentina with a hefty financial bailout, has threatened to pull support if Milei does not perform well in the elections.""Don't give up because we're halfway there,"" Milei told supporters at a closing campaign event in the port city of Rosario on Thursday. ""We're on a good path.""Milei, who has built his presidency on austerity measures and drastic economic reforms, saw his popularity drop amid a corruption scandal and public weariness.While his reforms have tamed inflation, the dramatic welfare cuts have severely affected universities, public hospitals and pensioners.His party was defeated at the polls in Buenos Aires' provincial elections in September as a result, an outcome which was seen as indicative of the mood going into Sunday's ballot.A majority seems out of Milei's reach. However, political experts say that if the president's party grabs more than 35% of the votes, his government would be able to block opposition to his vetos through alliances with other parties.Sunday's outcome will be closely watched by the White House.Facing pressure from the Peso, which continues to lose ground, and inflation which is creeping back up, Milei sought help from one of his best political friends: US President Donald Trump.Trump, who has called Milei his ""favourite president,"" offered a financial package in the form of a currency swap worth $20 billion (€17.2 billion) and the promise of another $20 billion in aid from private banks.But soon after, Trump imposed a condition that Milei must not suffer defeat at the hands of ""socialists or communists.""","Half of Argentina's lower chambers of deputies and a third of the Senate's seats are up for grabs in legislative elections.

What to expect in Trump-Xi meeting

US-China ties





US President Donald Trump will meet Chinese President Xi Jinping on October 30, on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit in South Korea, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Thursday, reaffirming the meeting that had been questioned following an escalation in trade tensions.Leavitt informed reporters that Trump departs for Malaysia late on Friday night and will also visit Japan and South Korea. In South Korea, he is scheduled to meet Xi next Thursday after addressing the APEC CEO Summit.""On Thursday morning local time, President Trump will participate in a bilateral meeting with President Xi of the People's Republic of China, before departing to return home,"" Leavitt said.Trump on Thursday (local time) took a tough stance on China's alleged role in smuggling fentanyl into the US via Venezuela.He accused China of using Venezuela as a transit point for fentanyl, evading US and Mexican port controls. Trump, during a press interaction at the White House, stated that the first question he would ask the Chinese leader would be about fentanyl.""I'm meeting with President Xi... The first question I'm going to be asking him about is fentanyl. They make $100 million selling fentanyl into our country. They lose $100 billion with the 20% tariff.So it's not a good business proposition... It's one of the things we're talking about... They pay a very big penalty for doing that... We'll see what happens at the end of next week... I'm meeting with President Xi, actually, in South Korea. ..,"" said Trump.There is a lot at stake, so pressure is building on both leaders Trump and Xi to calm trade tensions that risk damaging the world’s two biggest economies.In this meeting, Trump is expected to crack a deal with Xi as he recently offered to lower tariffs on Chinese exports to the US but insisted that Beijing, too, had to make concessions, including resuming purchases of US soya beans, curbing the flow of ingredients used to make the opioid fentanyl – which has caused an overdose epidemic in America – and lifting restrictions on the export to the US of rare earth minerals, which are needed to manufacture hi-tech products such as smartphones, Guardian reported.Rare-earth stocks continue to be at the top of investors’ minds as the market weighs potential outcomes of a meeting between the leaders of the world’s two largest economies.A failure to reduce trade tensions could further harm US industries that are already grappling with the impact of Trump’s tariffs.The President was optimistic ahead of his meeting with Xi, telling reporters this week: “I think we’re going to end up having a fantastic deal with China … it’s going to be fantastic for the entire world”.Time is of the essence, however, as Trump and Xi’s meeting, yet to be confirmed by Beijing, is scheduled to occur just as additional duties of 100% on Chinese exports to the US are set to take effect.The leaders are also expected to discuss Taiwan, amid concerns that Trump might hesitate in Washington’s support for the democratic, self-governing island under pressure from Xi.Beijing has reportedly requested the White House to declare opposition to Taiwan independence – a move that would please China, which considers Taiwan a renegade province that must be reunified with the mainland.Trade tensions between the United States and China intensified in recent weeks following President Trump's announcement of 100 per cent tariffs on Chinese exports, set to take effect two days after the leaders meet.Trump's pledge followed China's announcement of newly imposed export controls on rare earth metals and related technologies in electronics and military goods.The new US tariffs would be “over and above any tariff” that China is already paying, Trump wrote in a social media post earlier this month. Trump added on Wednesday that his priority is to end Russia's war in Ukraine.Xi “would now like to see that war end,” the president said. It will be the first in-person meeting between the leaders since 2019, when the two met in Japan at the G20 summit, as per Politico.","US President Donald Trump will meet Chinese President Xi Jinping on October 30, on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit in South Korea.

New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani continues to hold a double-digit lead in the race, but his advantage over Andrew M. Cuomo tightens considerably when Republican Curtis Sliwa is excluded from the contest, according to a new poll.A new poll from AARP and Gotham Polling indicates that Democrat Zohran Mamdani maintains a lead in the New York City mayoral race with 43.2%.Independent candidate Andrew Cuomo follows in second place at 28.9%, while Republican Curtis Sliwa holds third place with 19.4%. The race is entering its final phase, with the next debate scheduled for Wednesday, early voting set to commence in five days, and Election Day 15 days away, CBS news reported.CBS News New York reports that the same poll suggests a tight race between Cuomo and Mamdani should Sliwa withdraw, placing Cuomo four percentage points behind Mamdani—within the poll's margin of error. In such a scenario, Mamdani would lead with 44.6% against Cuomo's 40.7%.""I’m not dropping out,"" Sliwa declared, reaffirming his participation in the race. Last week, Cuomo had expressed that Sliwa's continued campaign would hinder his chances of defeating Mamdani.However, on Monday morning, Cuomo altered his stance, stating on Fox News that Sliwa is ""irrelevant.""""He does take a certain number of votes, and to that extent, he is a spoiler. I believe he’s, ultimately, irrelevant, because he’s not a viable candidate and I don't think people are gonna throw away their vote,"" Cuomo stated.Sliwa responded, ""I’m not dropping out. One person, one vote. That’s how we determine elections. I never heard a caveat that said one person, one vote, and of course others need to drop out along the way.""Mamdani welcomed Sliwa's participation, stating, ""It’s genuinely positive for our democracy that there’s another candidate in this race who believes New York City voters should pick their next mayor, not billionaires who mostly live somewhere else.""He also criticised Cuomo for focusing on other candidates, noting, ""We are spending this time speaking directly to New Yorkers. Andrew Cuomo is spending it speaking about the other candidates.""

FBI's Kash Patel Announces BIG Arrests: NBA Gambling Ring Bust, Terry Rozier, Billups Arrested





US president Donald Trump on Sunday alleged that Democrats cheated in the 2020 elections and repeated the claim that they were “rigged and stolen”. He compared the alleged “cheating” to reports of NBA players cheating at cards, calling the election issue a “far bigger scandal.”""What’s worse, the NBA Players cheating at cards, and probably much else, or the Democrats cheating on Elections. The 2020 Presidential Election, being Rigged and Stolen, is a far bigger SCANDAL,"" Trump said through a post on Truth Social.Trump was referring to a major basketball scandal in which federal indictments alleged that current and former NBA players, including a Hall of Fame coach, were connected to Mafia-linked gambling rings.He said the country suffered under President Joe Biden , whom he referred to as a “crooked moron,” and urged the Department of Justice to investigate the 2020 election.Trump warned that similar issues could occur during future elections, including the upcoming midterms, if stricter voting measures were not implemented. He reiterated his opposition to mail-in and early voting and called for mandatory voter identification.""I hope the DOJ pursues this with as much “gusto” as befitting the biggest SCANDAL in American history! If not, it will happen again, including the upcoming Midterms. No mail-in or “Early” Voting, Yes to Voter ID!""

The measure would allow Democrats to redraw district boundaries, potentially creating five additional safe seats.Earlier this year, Trump signed an executive order aimed at making broad changes to how elections are conducted, even though the Constitution grants that authority primarily to individual states. Portions of the order have since been blocked by the courts.The Justice Department is currently requesting US states to provide voter information, including sensitive personal data such as partial Social Security numbers, as part of its effort to investigate potential cases of voter fraud, as cited by CNN.","US president Donald Trump on Sunday alleged that Democrats cheated in the 2020 elections.

'Mystery' Patriot Or...? Decoding The SHOCK $130Mn Gift To Pay Troops Amid Shutdown





Timothy Mellon, a reclusive billionaire and a major financial backer of President Trump, is the anonymous private donor who gave $130 million to the US govt to help pay troops during the shutdown, according to two people familiar with the matter.Trump announced the donation Thursday, but he declined to identify the person who provided the funds, only calling him a ""patriot"" and a friend. But the two people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the donation was private, identified him as Mellon.Shortly after departing Washington on Friday, Trump again declined to identify Mellon while talking to reporters aboard Air Force One. He only said the individual was ""a great American citizen"" and a ""substantial man."" ""He doesn't want publicity,"" Trump said as he headed to Malaysia. The White House declined to comment. Multiple attempts to reach Mellon and representatives for him were unsuccessful.It remains unclear how far the donation will go toward covering the salaries of the more than 1.3 million troops who make up the active-duty military. The Trump administration's 2025 budget requested about $600 billion in total military compensation; a $130 million donation would equal about $100 a service member.Mellon, a wealthy banking heir and railroad magnate, is a longtime backer of Trump and gave tens of millions of dollars to groups supporting the president's campaign.Last year, he made a $50 million donation to a super political action committee supporting Trump, which was one of the largest single contributions ever disclosed.A grandson of former treasury secretary Andrew W. Mellon, Mellon was not a prominent Republican donor until Trump was elected. But in recent years, he has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into supporting Trump and the Republican Party.The Pentagon said it accepted the donation under the ""general gift acceptance authority."" ""The donation was made on the condition that it be used to offset the cost of service members' salaries and benefits,"" Sean Parnell, the Pentagon's chief spokesperson, said in a statement. Still, the donation appears to be a potential violation of the Antideficiency Act, which prohibits federal agencies from spending money in excess of congressional appropriations or from accepting voluntary services.","Timothy Mellon, a reclusive billionaire and a major financial backer of President Trump, is the anonymous private donor who gave $130 million to the US govt to help pay troops during the shutdown, according to two people familiar with the matter.

A US Navy helicopter and a fighter jet crashed separately during routine operations over the South China Sea on Sunday, with no fatalities reported. The incidents coincided with US President Donald Trump’s visit to the region for the Asean Summit in Kuala Lumpur.According to the US Navy’s Pacific Fleet, the first crash involved an MH-60R Sea Hawk helicopter that “went down in the waters of South China Sea while conducting routine operations from the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz.” All three crew members aboard were rescued by search and rescue teams, the statement said.Roughly 30 minutes later, a Boeing F/A-18F Super Hornet fighter jet also crashed into the South China Sea “while conducting routine operations” from the same carrier. Both crew members successfully ejected and were safely recovered, the US navy confirmed.The US navy said on social media Sunday evening that the MH-60R Seahawk, assigned to the “Battle Cats” of Helicopter Maritime Strike Squadron (HSM) 73, went down around 2:45pm local time. “Search-and-rescue crews rescued three crew members,” the statement said.At 3:15pm, an F/A-18F Super Hornet assigned to the “Fighting Redcocks” of Strike Fighter Squadron (VFA) 22 also went down while conducting routine operations from the USS Nimitz.“All personnel involved are safe and in stable condition,” the US navy said. “The cause of both incidents is currently under investigation.”The crashes took place as US President Trump embarked on a diplomatic tour across Asia, where he is scheduled to meet Chinese leader Xi Jinping for discussions centered on trade. Relations between Washington and Beijing have been tense in recent weeks after both sides imposed new economic measures on each other.These incidents follow the loss of two Super Hornet jets in the Red Sea earlier this spring. Each F/A-18 fighter jet costs over $60 million, according to the Navy.

The recent romantic connection between former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and pop star Katy Perry is taking the internet by storm. Beyond their personal lives, this relationship raises intriguing questions about the intersection of celebrity culture and political branding.Trudeau is often dubbed the ""first prime minister of the Instagram age,"" and has adeptly utilized social media to craft a relatable and progressive image, according to the Guardian. His strategic use of platforms like Instagram has allowed him to connect with younger audiences. Values such as inclusivity and environmental consciousness are no strangers to him. This approach has been instrumental in shaping his political persona and public perception.Perry is known for her outspoken political stances and activism, and has similarly leveraged her celebrity status to influence public discourse, according to the Varierty. Her support for various social causes and political figures has demonstrated the power of celebrity endorsements in shaping political narratives. She backed Hillary Clinton for US president in 2016 even though she lost.The convergence of Trudeau's political brand and Perry's celebrity influence could potentially create a dynamic synergy.Their shared values and public personas might amplify messages related to social justice, environmental sustainability, and progressive governance. Such a partnership could resonate with younger demographics, further solidifying their influence in both political and cultural spheres.However, this blending of celebrity and politics is not without its challenges. Critics argue that the fusion of entertainment and political messaging can dilute substantive policy discussions. There is concern that the focus on personal relationships and public appearances may overshadow critical policy debates and governance issues.","Former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and pop star Katy Perry are reportedly dating.

A British Muslim journalist and political commentator, Sami Hamdi, was detained by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents at San Francisco International Airport on Sunday morning, officials said.His visa was revoked, and he remains in ICE custody, according to Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).“Under President Trump, those who support terrorism and undermine American national security will not be allowed to work or visit this country,” McLaughlin wrote on X. She also praised Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Secretary of State Marco Rubio for Hamdi’s removal, calling it “It’s common sense.”Hamdi is a journalist and political commentator, serving as the Editor-in-Chief of The International Interest, a magazine that covers Middle Eastern, Far Eastern, and UK politics. He has also contributed articles to Al Jazeera in 2022.The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) condemned the detention, calling it an “injustice.” “Earlier this morning, ICE agents abducted British Muslim journalist and political commentator Sami Hamdi at San Francisco Airport, apparently in response to his vocal criticism of the Israeli government during his ongoing speaking tour,” CAIR said.“We can confirm that Mr. Hamdi has not been deported and remains in custody. Our attorneys and partners are working to address this injustice.”CAIR further condemned the arrest as an attack on free speech, according to Kron4 News. “Everyone should recognise that arresting a British citizen legally visiting the United States because he dared to criticise a foreign nation’s genocide is our government’s latest blatant affront to free speech,” the organisation said. “Our nation must stop abducting critics of the Israeli government at the behest of unhinged Israel-first bigots; this is an Israel-first policy, not an America-first policy, and it must end. ”According to RAIR Foundation USA, Hamdi has repeatedly praised attacks carried out by Hamas, including the October 7, 2023 massacre in which over 1,200 civilians were killed. He described the hostage-taking and killings as “victorious” and “merciful,” and publicly glorified the operation, reposting videos of victims. DHS officials said that such actions qualify as espousing terrorist activity and demonstrated a clear alignment with a US-designated Foreign Terrorist Organization.Beyond his public statements, Hamdi has participated in international training programs linked to the Muslim Brotherhood, a network identified by US authorities as cultivating operatives for political and ideological influence abroad. While in the United States, he reportedly instructed audiences to destabilise support for US allies, target officials, and weaponise elections. ICE cited these activities as evidence that Hamdi was using US soil to further extremist agendas, radicalise audiences, and operate as an embedded actor for a foreign network hostile to American interests.","Sami Hamdi was detained by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents at San Francisco International Airport on Sunday morning.

In a dramatic turnaround, technology giants that once de-platformed Donald Trump are now among the principal donors financing his $300 million White House ballroom. The 90,000-square-foot venue, which will replace the historic East Wing, has sparked debate over corporate influence, historic preservation, and political optics.The ballroom is now more than a luxury venue—it is a symbol of the interplay between money, influence, and politics in modern Washington.Google’s parent company, Alphabet, reportedly contributed $22 million as part of a legal settlement tied to Trump’s suspension from YouTube following the January 6 Capitol riot. Four years ago, the company blocked Trump from the platform, citing violations of policy, yet today it is underwriting his extravagant White House project.Apple, which publicly criticised Trump’s policies on immigration and climate change during his first term, is now listed as a donor to the ballroom. The tech giant has reportedly pledged funding while also seeking to maintain a favourable relationship with the current administration amid upcoming antitrust and privacy legislation.Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and company executives were vocal critics of Trump’s presidency, particularly regarding corporate taxation and market dominance.Now Amazon has made substantial contributions, reportedly tied to procurement and cloud contracts, signalling a strategic pivot towards engagement rather than opposition.Microsoft suspended certain services and publicly condemned Trump-era immigration policies. Today, the company is among the key donors for the ballroom, coinciding with the administration awarding Microsoft lucrative government AI and cloud service contracts.Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, banned Trump for violations of platform rules during the January 6 events. Now, the company has contributed to the White House ballroom project.The ballroom’s construction has already resulted in the demolition of the East Wing, a space historically assigned to the Office of the first lady. Experts argue the project represents a larger story of how corporate America navigates political power, switching between condemnation and support depending on strategic benefit.Ethics observers warn that these donations could present conflicts of interest, as several donors hold or are pursuing contracts with the Trump administration.","Tech giants that once de-platformed Donald Trump are now among the principal donors financing his $300 million White House ballroom.

The Giving Pledge’s standout success story





John and Laura Arnold are the rare billionaires who have not only pledged to give away their wealth but are already doing it. According to Fortune and Forbes, the couple has donated over $2 billion to date, nearly 42% of their estimated $2.9 billion net worth. Their giving approach is hands-on, data-driven, and focused on immediate social impact rather than waiting for future generations. With John Arnold earning a 5 out of 5 philanthropy rating from Forbes, they stand out as the only Giving Pledge signatories who have already lived up to the promise while still alive.John Arnold began his career as a standout natural gas trader at Enron, quickly rising through the ranks due to his analytical skill and bold strategy in energy markets. When Enron collapsed, he founded his own hedge fund, Centaurus Partners, which rapidly became one of the most profitable energy-trading firms in the world.Centaurus gained prominent recognition for predicting and profiting from the 2006 collapse of Amaranth Advisors, solidifying Arnold’s status as one of the sharpest minds in commodities finance.Despite his extraordinary success, Arnold grew increasingly interested in how evidence and data could drive public progress more effectively than market speculation.In 2012, with a personal fortune already secured, he retired at just 38 years old and redirected his competitive drive fully into philanthropy.Laura Arnold followed a different but equally accomplished path. A former corporate lawyer and senior executive in the energy sector, she brought legal expertise and a strong focus on social equity to their mission. Together, the Arnolds decided that their wealth should not simply treat symptoms of inequality but help fix the foundational systems that drive it.The couple established Arnold Ventures in 2008. Today, the organisation operates with more than 150 employees across Houston, New York City, and Washington, D.C. Their philanthropy is rooted in measurable outcomes rather than traditional charity spending, and focuses on core policy areas such as:The Arnolds aim to embed evidence-based policymaking into government systems, ensuring reforms that work can be scaled at national level.While many billionaire donors fulfil their pledges through wills or multi-generational foundations, the Arnolds believe wealth must be used now to address urgent challenges. They have publicly stated that they do not plan to keep a perpetual family foundation once they are gone. Their goal is to move money into action rather than preserve it as an asset.The strategy reflects a simple principle: philanthropy must work during a donor’s lifetime, not be promised for later.Launched in 2010 by Bill and Melinda French Gates and Warren Buffett, the Giving Pledge encourages billionaires to donate at least half of their wealth. Hundreds of high-profile names have signed, including Michael Bloomberg, Elon Musk, George Lucas, and Mark Zuckerberg. Yet a 2025 report by the Institute for Policy Studies found that John and Laura Arnold are the only signatories to have fully met the pledge’s expectations while alive.Their approach has been praised for transparency, accountability, and a willingness to fund reform rather than reputation-enhancing charity.Arnold Ventures continues to expand into emerging and often controversial areas of public concern. In 2025, they partnered with the American Institute for Boys and Men to support research into the long-term effects of online sports betting as legalisation spreads across the United States.They have also invested $20 million in grants for youth empowerment programmes in Maryland through a partnership with Governor Wes Moore. Their work reflects a growing ambition to reshape policies that define the future of education, health, and community wellbeing.","John and Laura Arnold have donated over $2 billion to date, nearly 42% of their estimated $2.9 billion net worth. They stand out as the only Giving Pledge signatories who have already lived up to the promise while still alive.

'H-1Bs do not displace American workers'





Level 4: Highest-paying jobs. They will get four entries in the lottery Level 3: Three entries Level 2: Two entries Level 1: Lowest paying jobs and they get one entry.





As the US is planning to move to a wage-based H-1B selection and invited comments from stakeholders, the American Hospital Association informed the Department of Homeland Security that rural hospitals may suffer from the proposed changes to H-1B selection. The H-1B visa program allows companies to hire skilled people from foreign countries, including health workers and the selection is done through a random lottery.But the administration is now aiming to move to a process where companies that pay higher wages have the maximum chance of getting skilled workers from foreign countries. While the aim of this proposed selection process is to save entry-level tech jobs from foreigners, the AHA says that rural hospitals may suffer because they don't have high wages to offer which means they have a lesser chance to get foreign healthcare workers.In its letter, the AHA said H-1B visa program is a critical short-term approach for US hospitals to recruit highly skilled health care professionals. ""Foreign-trained medical professionals do not displace American workers. Instead, they play a critical role in improving the health of the communities our hospitals serve. They are highly qualified, required to meet our nation’s standards for education, English fluency and state licensure,"" it said.The association said that H-1Bs in health care are paid based on their US experience which is often zero, even though they have worked in foreign countries. ""The weighted selection process, as currently proposed, also could be especially detrimental to rural and underserved areas. Hospitals and health systems serving these areas face substantial financial headwinds, placing constraints on their ability to pay higher wages that could increase the probability of receiving H-1B visas in a weighted selection process,"" they said.In the proposed weighted selection, there are four levelsThe AHA proposed that all health care workers should be considered level 4 so that hospitals get their equal share of H-1B healthcare workers.",American Hospital Association says the proposed wage-based H-1B rule will hurt healthcare.

'Really long-range missiles '





Why not an 'ugly ship'?





Is Trump's 'aesthetic eye' important?









US President Donald Trump is reportedly pushing for a new armada of US Navy warships, dubbed the “Golden Fleet,” to counter what he sees as an increasing threat from China, as reported by the Wall Street JournalThe plans come as Trump prepares for a high-stakes meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping during his first visit to Asia since assuming office in January this year.According to the report, Trump and senior officials are discussing a fleet of advanced warships equipped with long-range missiles. “This battleship of tomorrow is going to be this thing that carries really long-range missiles,” Bryan Clark, a retired Navy officer and senior fellow at the Hudson Institute involved in the discussions, told the outlet.The Pentagon and the White House are also reportedly exploring plans for a new 15,000 to 20,000-ton ship that would be heavily armoured and could potentially carry hypersonic missiles. White House spokesperson Anna Kelly hinted at a forthcoming announcement, saying, “Stay tuned!” while praising Trump’s efforts to “bolster America’s maritime dominance.”Trump has long voiced opinions on the appearance of US Navy vessels. Former Secretary of Defense Mark Esper recalled telling Trump that warships “are built to fight and win, not win beauty contests.” At a recent summit in Virginia, Trump admitted he was “not a fan” of some ships.“They say, ‘Oh, it's stealth.’ I said, ‘That's not stealth.’ An ugly ship is not necessary in order to say you're stealth,” he said.Navy secretary John Phelan also revealed that Trump frequently texted him late at night about the state of ships, sometimes after 1 am, asking what was being done about rusty vessels or those in the yard.Not everyone agrees with the new fleet plans. Retired naval officer Mark Montgomery, a senior fellow with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told the WSJ that the administration should focus on fixing the existing backlog of ship maintenance. “The president’s aesthetic eye is not the proper paradigm to evaluate tactical ship requirements,” he said.The proposal follows earlier controversies in the Navy, including a directive by defence secretary Pete Hegseth to rename the replenishment oiler USNS Harvey Milk, named after the gay rights icon and Navy veteran.

Row erupts over Melania Trump’s silence on White House demolition: ‘Doesn’t care about history...’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/row-erupts-over-melania-trumps-silence-on-white-house-demolition-doesnt-care-about-history-/articleshow/124830672.cms,"



As bulldozers tear down the East Wing of the White House to make way for President Donald Trump’s multi-million dollar ballroom, one voice has been notably missing from the debate — that of first lady Melania Trump.The East Wing was once the headquarters of first ladies since the Carter era. The demolition has upended her office space and disrupted public tours, yet Melania has not publicly commented on the matter.Her office declined to respond when asked by CNN whether she supports the project, despite the outcry from former East Wing staffers of both parties. Crews began work this week on the president’s long-promised gilded ballroom, which critics, mostly Democratic, have called an unnecessary vanity project.Melania spends most of her time in New York and Palm Beach. She rarely visits Washington and keeps a small staff of just five full-time members. These aides have been temporarily relocated to rooms within the executive mansion.The White House has not confirmed whether the ballroom’s design will include permanent office space for the first lady.According to experts, the lack of communication shows her increasingly distant role during her husband’s second term.Kate Andersen Brower, author of First Women, which explores the influence of presidential spouses, said: “Watching the demolition is the physical embodiment of watching the first lady’s role become smaller and smaller. She’s making it clear that – like her husband – she’s not going to be like any other first lady. … She doesn’t care about historic precedent, either.”“Since Monday, I have heard from alumni of the East Wing from multiple administrations who are understandably stunned by the images,” said Anita McBride, former chief of staff to First Lady Laura Bush. “First ladies’ staff lived and witnessed history within those walls and nothing can take away the memories of working in that extraordinarily special place of purpose and service.”Observers have compared Melania’s silence to a neighbour ignoring the demolition of her own garage.“It would be like — you’re really close to your next door neighbour, but they decided to demolish your garage for a basketball court, and you didn’t really say anything about it,” said journalist Kate Bennett, author of Free, Melania.During her first term, Melania was an active steward of White House preservation, overseeing furniture restorations and the Rose Garden redesign. But this time, she has largely stepped back, leaving her husband to take charge of renovations.The East Wing has long been a symbol of the first lady’s influence. Built in 1902 and expanded in 1942, it became the official home of the Office of the first lady under Rosalynn Carter in 1977. For decades, it served as both a working space and the main entrance for state dinners and receptions.","The East Wing was once the headquarters of first ladies since the Carter era.

Trump Alleges UN Sabotage After Teleprompter & Escalator Fail During Malaysia Visit, Crowd in Shock





Canada Prime Minister Mark Carney did a 'Trump' in Malaysia as he, on camera, confused 'premier' and 'president' and called Ontario Premier Doug Ford the President -- the way Donald Trump confuses the post of Canada's topmost leader and calls them 'president', 'governor' etc. Carney flew to Kuala Lumpur to address the ASEAN summit just after Donald Trump dropped the bombshell, ending trade talks with Canada and then raised tariffs on Canadian goods. Trump is angry that Canada is trying to influence Americans that Ronald Reagan, the much-loved Republican president, was against tariffs, as Canada launched an advertisement which was extensively broadcast on US networks.The advertisement was launched by Ontario Premier Doug Ford, a Conservative leader, who is now being accused of sabotaging the US-Canada trade talks. Ford and Carney, despite their political differences, claimed to be on the same page on trade with the US. Ford said the ad would be withdrawn.In Malaysia, Carney unleashed his playful side as he called Premier Ford 'a good friend' the same way Trump refers to world leaders. ""Did I say good friend Premier Ford?"" Mark Carney said with a smile and then went on to refer to Ford as 'President Ford', only to correct himself with a defence that he always confuses between Premier and President.'God! Sorry, I don't know why I mix the two up -- President and Premier Ford,"" he said.Recently, Trump called Carney the President instead of Prime Minister and when Carney corrected Trump, Trump defended that at least he did not call Carney a Governor. Carney's predecessor Justin Trudeau had to resign earlier this year under growing pressure from the party as he became a laughing stock for Trump who invited Canada to join the US as the 51st state with Trudeau being the Governor.","Mark Carney says he confuses between 'Premier' and 'President' and ends up calling Doug Ford the president.

What Bollaro’s defence said







When food cravings overcame essential responsibilities, a cop evidently went to satisfy them, ending in fatal tragedy.A New Jersey police sergeant was charged with official misconduct and tampering with records after allegedly ignoring multiple 911 calls about a shooting and instead driving to get a pizza and chit-chat, prosecutors said.Franklin Township police sergeant Kevin Bollaro faces up to 10 years in prison and a $150,000 fine over his response to the deaths of 29-year-old Tyler Webb and his girlfriend, 33-year-old Lauren Semanchik, on August 1, reports the Daily Mail.45-year-old New Jersey State Police Lieutenant Ricardo Santos and Semanchik's ex-boyfriend was confirmed as the murderer.

Even after getting more calls from dispatch about worried neighbours, he only spent a few minutes at the first location and did not talk to the second or third callers.GPS data also showed he did not check the area where he could have found Semanchik’s home.Bollaro is also accused of driving to Duke’s Pizzeria & Restaurant, where he remained for 50 minutes, and then to the Pittstown Inn, where he stayed for nearly an hour, engaging socially with patrons. He later spent five hours at Locust Grover Cemetery, despite no criminal activity being reported there.Tyler Webb and Lauren Semanchik were found by police officers on August 2 after a call reported an unconscious woman with apparent physical trauma. Investigators said Santos had been stalking and harassing Semanchik prior to the shooting. Her father discovered her inside their home the day after the 911 calls.Bollaro’s attorney, Charles Sciarra, defended his client, saying, ""Nothing Kevin Bollaro did or did not do that day impacted or could have stopped that tragedy in any way.

‘Indians Are Very Mature…’: US State Secy Marco Rubio’s Big Remark On US-Pakistan Ties





Revitalized US ties with Islamabad will not be at the expense of Washington’s “deep, historic, and important” ties with India, US secretary of state Marco Rubio has said amid what he saw as disquiet in New Delhi about the Trump White House’s pivot towards the military regime in Pakistan.In a chat with pool reporters on his way to the Asean meeting in Malaysia via Doha, Rubio said New Delhi had not directly communicated any unease to the US on the matter “but we know they’re concerned for obvious reasons because of the tensions that have existed between Pakistan and India historically” and “Indians are very mature when it comes to diplomacy and things of that nature.”“Look, they have some relationships with countries that we don’t have relationships with. So, it’s part of a mature, pragmatic foreign policy. I don’t think anything we’re doing with Pakistan comes at the expense of our relationship or friendship with India,” Rubio said, adding that New Delhi has to understand the US will have relations with a lot of different countries, and it currently sees an opportunity to expand its strategic relationship with Pakistan.Rubio’s remarks come at a time US-India relations, long considered a cornerstone of Washington’s Indo-Pacific strategy, is under pressure given the trade and tariff tensions with New Delhi and the slack US has cut for China and Pakistan -- at India's expense.Pakistan currently has a 19 per cent tariff on its exports to the US compared to India's 50 percent.When pressed on whether India might need to reduce its reliance on Russian oil to secure a broader trade deal with the US, Rubio noted that India has already expressed interest in diversifying its oil portfolio.“The more they buy from us, the less they’ll buy from someone else,” he said, suggesting that increased US oil exports could displace India’s purchases from other suppliers, such as Russia. Yet, he avoided committing to specifics on trade negotiations, stating, “I’m not negotiating trade deals, so I’m not going to speak on that.”While Rubio appeared to be echoing the traditionalist State Department outlook that continues to hew to Washington's Indo-Pacific strategy, the Trump White House seems less enthused about it in recent weeks as the US president seeks to engage China, having realized Beijing holds many cards – from its stranglehold on rare earth elements to buying American agricultural produce.He is also transparently in thrall of Pakistan following reports of its pledge to supply rare earths minerals and its interest in crypto business run by family associates, with unvarnished admiration for the country de-facto military ruler, field marshal Asim Munir.Rubio is expected meet his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar in Malaysia to continue the ministerial level dialogue since Prime Minister Modi chose to skip the meet, forgoing a meeting with Trump amid apparent misgivings over his grandstanding, with claims of having “solved” the India-Pakistan war – a four day clash that ended when the Pakistani director general of military ops phoned is Indian counterpart to seek a ceasefire.The state department and the national security council, both now run by Rubio – a former Senator who was once derided as “Little Marco” by Trump when he ran for GOP nomination – has had to finesse its position in line with White House priorities even as a trade agreement with India remains in limbo. According to officials who are clued into the talks, an agreement is almost ready, but it needs to be signed off by the President, and “no one has any idea if it will satisfy him. ”","‘Indians are very mature when it comes to diplomacy and things of that nature.

Rising tensions along the border





Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif has warned that Islamabad will go into an “open war” with Afghanistan if the ongoing peace talks in Istanbul collapse, according to a report by TOLO News. The discussions are aimed at defusing weeks of cross-border tensions and deadly clashes between the two countries.Speaking to reporters, Asif said there had been no fresh incidents along the border in recent days, suggesting that the Doha Agreement had been “somewhat effective.” However, he cautioned that the calm could be temporary if diplomacy fails to resolve long-standing disputes. Afghan officials have not yet responded to his remarks.Delegations from both countries are in Istanbul for the second round of talks, which focus on strengthening the Doha Agreement, preventing cross-border attacks, and restoring bilateral trust. According to TOLO News, the negotiations are centred on four key issues: creating a joint border monitoring system, ensuring mutual respect for sovereignty, addressing Pakistan’s long-standing security concerns, and lifting trade barriers.The dialogue also includes discussions on halting the forced deportation of Afghan refugees and preventing the refugee issue from becoming politicised. Pakistan recently began demolishing refugee camps in Balochistan, displacing thousands of Afghans. Camps in Loralai, Gardi Jungle, Saranan, Zhob, Qala-e-Saifullah, Pishin, and Muslim Bagh were cleared, with residents saying they were forced out abruptly without time to collect their belongings.Asif reminded reporters that Pakistan had supported Afghanistan “for decades” by sheltering millions of migrants. “We have stood by them through the hardest times,” he said, adding that Islamabad’s patience was running thin after continued militant attacks allegedly originating from Afghan soil.The Istanbul talks follow the first round of negotiations held in Doha on October 18 and 19, jointly mediated by Qatar and Turkiye. During those meetings, both sides agreed to an “immediate ceasefire” after intense border clashes that killed dozens.Qatar’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said at the time that the follow-up discussions in Turkiye were meant to ensure “the sustainability of the ceasefire and verify its implementation in a reliable and sustainable manner.”“A round of negotiations between the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and Afghanistan was held in Doha, mediated by the State of Qatar and the Republic of Turkiye. During the negotiations, the two sides agreed to an immediate ceasefire and the establishment of mechanisms to consolidate lasting peace and stability between the two countries,” the Qatari statement said.The flare-up between Islamabad and Kabul earlier this month began after Pakistan demanded that the Taliban government take stronger action against militants launching attacks from inside Afghanistan. In response, Pakistan carried out cross-border airstrikes, leading to heavy exchanges of fire that killed and injured dozens on both sides.Taliban officials, however, rejected Islamabad’s claims. The Islamic Emirate said Afghan territory “is not being used to attack Pakistan” and that it “does not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries.” Kabul insisted it remains committed to maintaining peace and regional stability.Despite recent calm, Pakistan’s warning of an “open war” has reignited concerns of a potential escalation between the two neighbours, who share deep historical, ethnic, and economic ties but remain divided over border security, militancy, and the treatment of refugees.The outcome of the Istanbul talks is expected to determine whether the fragile ceasefire holds or if the region faces yet another round of hostilities.(With inputs from ANI and TOLO news)","Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif has warned that Islamabad will go into an “open war” with Afghanistan if the ongoing peace talks collapse.

But I saw that they want peace.”The clashes erupted after Islamabad demanded the Taliban curb militants it says have been attacking Pakistan from sanctuaries inside Afghanistan.Pakistan responded with cross-border airstrikes, and both sides exchanged heavy fire, killing dozens and prompting the closure of key crossings, which remain shut.The talks in Istanbul aim to devise a mechanism to enforce a longer-term Doha ceasefire.“There have been no incidents in the four to five days since it was agreed, and both sides were complying with the truce,” Asif said, underlining the delicate situation along the 2,640-km Durand Line border.Earlier, Pakistan and Afghanistan had agreed to an immediate ceasefire after days of deadly clashes, according to Qatar’s foreign ministry, which said both sides also agreed to establish mechanisms to ensure lasting peace and stability.The violence, which began on October 11, followed Pakistani airstrikes in Kabul and Paktika targeting groups linked to the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).Amid the tensions, the Taliban government has ordered construction of a dam on the Kunar River to limit Pakistan’s water supply, according to RT, escalating non-military pressure on Islamabad and adding another layer to the strained bilateral relations.","Talks in Istanbul aim to devise a mechanism to enforce a longer-term Doha ceasefire.

Toronto Conference Highlights Pakistan’s Human Rights Violations In Balochistan, Sindh And KPK





Pakistan’s Supreme Court, in a landmark ruling, has reinforced a woman’s right to dissolve her marriage through Khula—an Islamic provision that allows a woman to seek divorce independently.The decision came after a woman challenged the Peshawar High Court’s rejection of her dissolution request. The PHC had denied her petition, stating that her husband’s consent was necessary and that all efforts at reconciliation had not been exhausted.The two-member bench, comprising Justice Ayesha A Malik and Justice Naeem Afghan, ruled that the PHC’s decision was incorrect and reinstated the Family Court’s decree of dissolution. The court clarified that Khula is a voluntary right of the wife and cannot be made conditional upon the husband’s consent or judicial discretion.Justice Malik, who authored the judgment, wrote, as quoted by PTI, “The Family Court's role is not to force a woman to stay in a marriage where there is no harmony or substance.”The ruling also marks a significant step in recognising psychological abuse — including humiliation, neglect, intimidation, and emotional abuse — as valid grounds for seeking divorce under Islamic law.“Cruelty need not always manifest in physical violence,” the judgment stated. The court emphasised that mental cruelty can be as damaging as physical abuse, and a woman’s emotional well-being should be taken into account when assessing the viability of a marriage.The Supreme Court criticised the patriarchal interpretations used by lower courts, which limited women’s agency and autonomy. It cited Articles 14, 25, and 35 of the Constitution, which guarantee dignity, equality before the law, and protection of the family, emphasising that the right to seek Khula embodies these guarantees.The court restored the Family Court’s decree of dissolution, recognising the petitioner’s right to seek divorce on the grounds of second marriage and psychological cruelty. It also ruled that the petitioner would retain her dower, including the gold, money, and property given at the time of marriage.",Pakistan's Supreme Court upholds a woman's right to dissolve her marriage through Khula.

At Least 24 Killed As Pakistan Air Force Bombs Tirah Village In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa





Unidentified attackers on Friday bombed an under-construction girls’ primary school in Gara Budha village of Pakistan ’s Tank district, near Dera Ismail Khan.The explosion occurred after unidentified attackers planted explosives along the school’s boundary wall and beneath several classrooms. The early morning blast tore through the nearly completed building, causing extensive damage, as reported by The Dawn.Police said a bomb disposal unit later inspected the site, collected evidence, and assessed the extent of the destruction.The motive and those responsible for the bombing are yet to be identified.The blast sparked concern in the local community, with residents urging provincial authorities to rebuild the school immediately and strengthen security at educational institutions in the area.They also warned that if the attackers were not arrested soon, they would stage protests to demand justice.""This is not just an attack on a school; it's an attack on the future of our daughters,"" said a local elder, as cited by ANI.The repeated attacks on educational facilities in Pakistan’s northwestern regions highlight ongoing challenges in ensuring the safety of learning spaces, particularly those for girls.Earlier this year, another under-construction government girls’ primary school in Pakistan’s northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province was damaged in an IED blast carried out by unidentified militants.Police said the explosives were planted inside the Azaan Javed Primary School in Baka Khel, Bannu district, and detonated with a powerful blast that caused significant structural damage.No casualties were reported as the building was unoccupied at the time, as cited by PTI.As per a report by the Lowy Institute, an Australian think tank, more than 1,100 girls’ schools were destroyed in Pakistan’s tribal areas between 2007 and 2017, with teachers and students often targeted.Before Pakistan’s military launched a full-scale operation in 2014, the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) had carried out hundreds of attacks on girls’ schools across the tribal belt and settled districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, operating from its stronghold in Swat district.Since taking over Afghanistan in 2021, the Taliban has banned girls from school after sixth grade and barred women from universities.The Pakistani Taliban, aligned with the Afghan group, are trying to enforce similar anti-education rules in Pakistan’s tribal areas by force.",Unidentified attackers on Friday bombed an under-construction girls’ primary school in Gara Budha village of Pakistan ’s Tank district.

9/11 attacks: Ex-CIA officer claims Osama bin Laden escaped to Pakistan disguised as woman





In a startling revelation, former CIA officer John Kiriakou said that Al-Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden escaped from the Tora Bora mountains in Afghanistan disguised as a woman after the September 11 attacks Kiriakou, who served 15 years in the CIA and headed counterterrorism operations in Pakistan , was speaking in an exclusive interview with ANI.He claimed that US forces believed they had cornered bin Laden and other Al-Qaeda leaders in October 2001.The CIA did not realize that the translator for the commander of Central Command was actually an Al-Qaeda operative. Believing bin Laden was cornered, US forces told him to come down the mountain, but through the translator, he requested time until dawn to evacuate women and children before surrendering.“We told him to come down the mountain. He said through the translator, ‘Can you just give us until dawn? We want to evacuate the women and children and then we’ll come down and give up,’” Kiriakou said.He added: “What ended up happening was bin Laden dressed as a woman and he escaped under the cover of darkness in the back of a pickup truck into Pakistan,” Kiriakou said.By dawn, Tora Bora was empty, forcing the US to shift operations into Pakistan.The former officer said that in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, the United States initially reacted cautiously.“First, the United States was reactive at the time rather than proactive.We waited a month until we had proper buildup in the region, and then we began attacking known Al-Qaeda sites, mostly in the Pashto areas of southern and eastern Afghanistan,” Kiriakou explained.Kiriakou also discussed the role of Pakistan in the operation. At the time, US relations with Pakistan were reportedly strong under then-President Pervez Musharraf .“Our relations with the Pakistani government were very, very good. We essentially just purchased Musharraf… he would let us do whatever we wanted to do,” Kiriakou said.He highlighted that Pakistan’s military had its own priorities, focusing more on India than on counterterrorism, allowing extremists to operate while pretending to cooperate with the US.The former CIA officer further revealed early links between Al-Qaeda and Lashkar-e-Taiba. During a raid in Lahore in March 2002, US forces captured three Lashkar-e-Taiba fighters along with an Al-Qaeda training manual.“It was the very first time we could attach the Pakistani government to Al-Qaeda,” Kiriakou said, emphasizing how this discovery highlighted the broader regional threats.Kiriakou admitted that strategic decisions were heavily influenced by US interests in Pakistan.“The relationship with Pakistan was bigger than India, at least temporarily. We needed them more than they needed us. We really needed them to let us base our drones in Balochistan, for example,” he said.He also spoke about the eventual tracking of bin Laden. The terrorist leader was found in Abbottabad, Pakistan and killed by US special forces on May 2, 2011.Reflecting on the overall counterterrorism efforts, Kiriakou said the initial failure to capture bin Laden at Tora Bora underscored the complexities of intelligence, infiltration and regional politics.“We thought we had him cornered, but the combination of deception, local dynamics, and strategic constraints meant the fight had to shift to Pakistan proper,” he said, giving a rare insight into the operational and political challenges faced by the US in the early years after 9/11.",Ex-CIA officer claims Osama bin Laden escaped from Tora Bora disguised as a woman.

'Not bulletproof': FATF warns Pakistan against terror funding; greylist exit does not shield from scrutiny,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/not-bulletproof-fatf-warns-pakistan-against-terror-funding-greylist-exit-does-not-shield-from-scrutiny/articleshow/124798444.cms,"FATF Issues Warning to Pakistan on Greylist Exit, Says Islamabad Still Vulnerable To Terror Funding

Terror funding for attacks in India









The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) on Saturday cautioned Pakistan that its removal from the greylist in October 2022 does not make it immune to scrutiny over money laundering or terrorist financing.FATF President Elisa de Anda Madrazo in a press briefing said, “Any country that is on the greylist or has exited it is not bulletproof against criminal actions, whether by money launderers or terrorists. We invite all jurisdictions, including those who have been delisted, to continue their good work to prevent and deter crimes.”Madrazo emphasised that all countries, including those recently delisted, must continue tightening safeguards against illicit financial activities. Her remarks come amid reports that Pakistan-based terror groups, including Jaish-e-Mohammad, have been using digital wallets and crypto channels to fund terror operations while masking financial flows.While Pakistan met key compliance benchmarks to exit the FATF greylist, it remains under follow-up by the Asia Pacific Group (APG), as the country is not a FATF member. The follow-up ensures Islamabad continues aligning with FATF’s global anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terror financing (CTF) standards.The greylist, formally known as the list of jurisdictions under increased monitoring, identifies countries with “strategic deficiencies” in curbing financial crimes and terror funding. India’s National Risk Assessment 2022 has highlighted Pakistan as a high-risk source of terror financing, citing persistent threats despite formal FATF compliance. A recent FATF report also noted rising instances of state-sponsored terrorism and flagged Pakistan’s National Development Complex as a proliferation risk in South Asia.In July this year, the global terror funding watchdog reported that explosives used in terrorist attacks in India were procured through e-commerce platforms. The revelation came in connection with attacks in Pulwama and at the Gorakhnath temple in Uttar Pradesh.Digital platforms, including social media, messaging apps, and crowdfunding sites, are increasingly being exploited for terror financing. Reported forms of support range from direct financial contributions to logistical or material assistance, as well as the provision of training.The Pulwama attack in 2019, planned and carried out by Jaish-e-Mohammed, saw transfer of large quantities of explosives in the country. A massive amount of the components used in the explosive devices used in the attack was acquired via electronic commerce platforms.The agency also said that the Pahalgam terror attack also could not have taken place without financial backing and without any route to transfer funds between terrorists and supporters.The FATF wrapped up its fourth plenary session in Paris under Madrazo’s presidency, attended by delegates from over 200 jurisdictions. The session approved the first mutual assessments under FATF’s new risk-based framework and removed Burkina Faso, Mozambique, Nigeria, and South Africa from the greylist after completion of their action plans.Reaffirming FATF’s global mission, Madrazo said, “FATF remains committed to strengthening standards and ensuring implementation so we can protect people by reducing terrorist financing worldwide.”","FATF warns Pakistan that its removal from the greylist in October 2022 does not make it immune to scrutiny over money laundering or terrorist financing.

Tomato prices in Pakistan surge over 400%: What’s driving the spike? Explained,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/tomato-prices-in-pakistan-surge-over-400-whats-driving-the-spike-explained/articleshow/124776793.cms,"AI image for representational purpose

'World Has Not Forgotten': India Blasts Pakistan’s Double Game on Terror at UN, Reminds Of Pahalgam

Why tomato prices are spiking





Impact of past trade trends





Why the border is closed





What this means for Pakistanis









Pakistan is witnessing a sharp surge in the prices of essential goods, particularly tomatoes, which have risen over 400 percent to around 600 Pakistani rupees ($2.13) per kilogram, following the closure of border crossings with Afghanistan.The move comes after clashes erupted between the two neighbours earlier this month, marking the worst fighting along their shared frontier since the Taliban’s 2021 takeover of Kabul.The closure of all trade and transit routes since October 11 has created severe shortages of fresh produce, grains, dairy, and other essentials. Khan Jan Alokozay, head of the Pak-Afghan Chamber of Commerce in Kabul, told Reuters, “With each passing day, both sides are losing around $1 million.”Tomatoes, a staple in Pakistani kitchens, have been particularly affected. About 500 containers of vegetables meant for export are spoiling daily due to the blockade, Alokozay said. In total, around 5,000 containers are stranded on both sides of the border, according to a Pakistani official at the Torkham crossing in northwest Pakistan. The official added that apples and grapes, largely imported from Afghanistan, are also in short supply.The disruption comes at a critical time when fresh produce from Afghanistan and northern Pakistan would normally enter local markets. The blockade has severed a trade route that contributes significantly to the $2.3 billion annual trade volume between the two countries, which includes fruit, vegetables, minerals, medicine, wheat, rice, sugar, meat, and dairy products.The price surge in tomatoes is also partly linked to longstanding cross-border trade dynamics. According to a PTI report, in 2011, Indian traders capitalised on higher tomato prices in Pakistan, sending trucks laden with produce across the Attari-Wagah border. Truckloads of tomatoes from Delhi and Nashik entered Pakistan daily, pushing up domestic prices in Indian markets. Experts noted that floods in Sindh and other Pakistani producing regions often exacerbate local shortages, further driving up prices.Currently, Pakistani consumers are facing a similar pattern, as reduced local supply coincides with the absence of imports due to the border closure. According to R P Gupta, director of the National Horticulture Research and Development Foundation, key producing regions such as Nashik, Pune, and Ahmadnagar in India usually cater to northern markets during this period. The absence of cross-border supplies intensifies the domestic price pressure in Pakistan.The recent clashes along the 2,600-kilometre frontier were triggered after Islamabad demanded that Kabul control militants who attack Pakistan from Afghan territory. The Taliban has denied harbouring such groups. Although a ceasefire brokered in talks hosted by Qatar and Turkey last weekend has largely held, the border remains closed. The next round of negotiations is scheduled for October 25 in Istanbul.Consumers in Pakistan are now paying significantly higher prices for basic staples. The scarcity of tomatoes, apples, and grapes is compounded by perishable stock spoilage, and there is growing concern over rising costs for other essentials. The commerce ministry has not issued a comment on the matter, leaving traders and residents to cope with soaring prices and limited availability.As the border closure continues, analysts warn that the inflationary impact on essential food items may persist, straining household budgets and local markets across Pakistan.","Pakistan is witnessing a sharp surge in the prices of essential goods, particularly tomatoes, which have risen over 400 percent to around 600 Pakistani rupees ($2.13) per kilogram.

Massive Violence Erupts In Pakistan After TLP’s Pro-Palestine March Turns Ugly





Pakistan’s cabinet on Thursday approved a proposal to ban the extremist Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) party under the country's Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) after it recently staged violent protests in the country.The decision was taken at a cabinet meeting chaired by Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, which discussed the Punjab government’s request to outlaw the religious group under the ATA of 1997, news agency PTI reported.The Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) said in a statement that the cabinet ""unanimously"" approved the ban. As per the PTI report, Pakistan's interior ministry presented a summary of the Punjab government’s request and briefed the meeting on the ""violent and terrorist activities of TLP in the country.""""The meeting was informed that this organisation, established in 2016, has incited violence across the country. Due to the organisation, incidents of violence have occurred in different parts of the country,"" the statement added.The PMO noted that the TLP was banned in 2021, but the ban was lifted after six months on the condition that the party would not carry out unrest or violent activities. The current ban was also justified by the group reneging on the guarantees given in 2021.""In the past, security personnel and innocent bystanders have been killed in violent protests and rallies by the TLP. The federal cabinet, after a briefing given to the meeting and the recommendation of the Punjab government, unanimously concluded that the TLP is involved in terrorism and violent acts,"" the statement said, as cited by PTI.After the ban, the TLP will be added to the list of proscribed groups maintained by the Pakistan's National Counter Terrorism Authority (NACTA), which already includes militant groups such as Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), Lashkar-e-Toiba, and extremist organisations like Lashkar-e-Jhangvi and Jaish-e-Mohammed.Before the listing, the federal government must refer the matter to the Pakistan Supreme Court within 15 days for approval. Once confirmed by the court, which has the final authority to ban a political party, the TLP will be officially added to the list of proscribed organisations.Earlier, the Pakistan's Punjab government had decided to ban the TLP in a meeting chaired by chief minister Maryam Nawaz on October 16, five days after the party began a protest march in Lahore. The TLP had launched a ""Gaza solidarity"" march on October 11, aiming to reach Islamabad and protest outside the US embassy. The march was halted at Muridke, around 60 km from Lahore, and dispersed on October 13.Clashes between police and TLP supporters at Muridke left around 16 people, including policemen, dead and over 1,600 injured. The TLP has a history of violent protests since 2017, when it staged a major protest and laid siege to Islamabad.Pakistan’s anti-cybercrime agency also arrested over 100 social media activists of the TLP for inflammatory posts. ""We have arrested 107 social media activists (of TLP) for inflammatory posts besides blocking 75 such accounts,"" Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari said at a press conference.Punjab police said they have arrested over 6,000 TLP activists following last week’s clashes. The government has sealed 61 seminaries run by the party and handed control of TLP mosques and seminaries to the Auqaf Department.","Pakistan's cabinet approved a proposal to ban the extremist Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) party under the country's Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) The decision was taken at a cabinet meeting chaired by Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.

Jaish-e-Mohammed Launches Online Jihad Course For Women In Pakistan, Targets Mass Recruitment





Days after Pakistan-based terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) announced the formation of its first-ever women’s wing, Jamaat-ul-Mominaat, the group has now launched an online training course to expand recruitment and collect funds from women, according to media reports.The digital course, namely ‘Tufat al-Muminat’ aims to attract as many women as possible to the outfit’s network. The initiative is being led by Sadiya Azhar, sister of JeM chief Masood Azhar Her husband, Yusuf Azhar, was killed in Operation Sindoor on May 7, when armed forces targeted JeM’s headquarters at Markaz Subhanallah in Bahawalpur.Sources said that Masood Azhar’s sisters, Sadiya and Samaira Azhar, will conduct 40-minute online classes daily, beginning November 8, using meeting platforms to teach women about their “duties” from the perspectives of jihad, religion and Islam.Each participant enrolling in the course is reportedly being asked to pay a donation of PKR 500 and fill out an online form.Intelligence sources indicate that the program is part of JeM’s broader effort to rebuild its base and financing network following significant losses in airstrikes during Operation Sindoor earlier this year.The announcement comes weeks after JeM publicly introduced its women’s brigade on October 8, followed by an event titled ‘Dukhtaran-e-Islam’ held in Rawalakot, Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, on October 19 to mobilise women supporters.Security officials say JeM’s decision to involve women marks a major shift in its operational strategy.The organisation, along with others such as Lashkar-e-Taiba and Hizbul Mujahideen, had previously avoided using women in active combat roles.Sources suggest that this move is viewed as a potential signal that JeM could begin training female suicide attackers, similar to tactics employed by groups like ISIS, Boko Haram, Hamas and LTTE.The development also underscores Pakistan’s continued tolerance of terror infrastructure on its soil. Despite Islamabad’s claims at global platforms of being a victim of terrorism and its assertions of compliance with FATF regulations, JeM and other banned groups reportedly continue to operate and collect donations openly through their network of markaz (centres).In September, Masood Azhar was also reported to have made a public appeal for funds during an address at Markaz Usman O Ali in Bahawalpur.Meanwhile, intelligence inputs suggest that JeM, Lashkar-e-Taiba and Hizbul Mujahideen have shifted their bases to Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province to avoid Indian airstrikes after Operation Sindoor.According to media reports, JeM has additionally launched an online fundraising campaign via EasyPaisa, seeking to raise Rs 3.91 billion for constructing 313 new centres across Pakistan.'","Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) has launched an online training course to expand recruitment and collect funds from women.

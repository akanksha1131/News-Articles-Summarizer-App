The 2005 conviction





MELBOURNE: Bradley John Murdoch, known as the ""Outback Killer"" and convicted of murdering British backpacker Peter Falconio who vanished in arid central Australia 24 years ago, has died, authorities said Wednesday. He was 67.Murdoch died Tuesday night in the palliative care unit of the Alice Springs Hospital, according to a statement from the northern territory department of corrections. He was diagnosed with terminal throat cancer in 2019 and was recently transferred to the hospital from the Alice Springs prison.His death leaves the mystery of the whereabouts of Falconio's body unsolved. The northern territory police force said Murdoch had apparently taken that secret to his grave.""The Northern Territory Police Force remains committed to resolving this final piece of the investigation,"" a police statement said.""It is deeply regrettable that Murdoch has died without, as far as we are aware, ever disclosing the location of Peter Falconio's remains,"" police said. ""His silence has denied the Falconio family the closure they have so long deserved.""In 2005, Murdoch was convicted of the 2001 murder of 28-year-old Falconio, from Huddersfield, Yorkshire, and the attempted kidnapping of Falconio's girlfriend Joanne Lees.The crime captured global attention and was one of the inspirations for the 2005 Australian horror movie ""Wolf Creek,"" about a serial killer who preyed on backpackers and left a single witness who became a suspect.Lees, who wrote about her ordeal in her 2006 memoir ""No Turning Back,"" complained that police treated her as a suspect in the years before Murdoch was charged.A court order prevented the movie's release in the northern territory during Murdoch's trial, fearing it could influence jurors. Murdoch was not accused of any other killings.Maintaining his innocence Murdoch consistently maintained his innocence and did not help authorities search for Falconio's remains.At the time of the killing, Murdoch was an interstate drug runner, using amphetamines to stay awake for dayslong drives and cannabis to sleep.On the night of July 14, 2001, he tricked Falconio and Lees into stopping their campervan on a dark and remote highway north of Alice Springs.Lees watched her boyfriend leave the van to inspect a supposedly sparking exhaust pipe. She testified that she heard a gunshot and never saw her boyfriend again.Murdoch, an imposing 193 centimeters (6 foot, 4 inches) in height, bound her wrists with cable ties before she managed to escape and hid in the desert scrub for hours. She testified she watched Murdoch searching for her with a flashlight and his dog.Lees later waved down a truck and raised the alarm.Police doubled the reward for information last month, police doubled the reward for information leading to the location of Falconio's remains to 500,000 Australian dollars ($330,000), following news that Murdoch was in palliative care.""Police still hold out hope that someone may be able to provide some vital information to assist in this search,"" police commander Mark Grieve said.Colleen Gwynne, a former police officer who led the investigation at the time of Falconio's disappearance, said Murdoch might have panicked after Lees escaped and in his confusion forgot what he did with the body.A sentence to life in prison ""Once that panic set in ... he may have disposed of a body somewhere he's not entirely certain where that is,"" Gwynne told 10 Network News television earlier this month.Murdoch was sentenced to life in prison for Falconio's murder and was ordered to serve at least 28 years before he could be considered for parole. He was also sentenced to six years for assaulting Lees.The earliest he could have applied for parole would have been 2032, but without providing information as to what he had done with Falconio's body, Murdoch was not likely to have been released. The territory passed laws in 2016 preventing prisoners convicted of murder from qualifying for parole unless they provide police with the location of their victims' bodies.Murdoch was born in the west coast town of Geraldton, the third child of an automobile mechanic and his wife, a hairdresser.As a teen, he became involved in biker gang crime and was first sentenced to prison in 1995 for shooting at a group of Indigenous people at Fitzroy crossing in western Australia. He served 15 months of a 21-month sentence.In sentencing Murdoch for Falconio's killing, Chief Justice Brian Martin said he doubted any words could express the trauma and terror Lees had suffered.""It must have been close to the worst nightmare imaginable,"" the judge said.",Bradley John Murdoch was convicted of murdering British backpacker Peter Falconio. Falconio vanished in arid central Australia 24 years ago. Murdoch was diagnosed with terminal throat cancer in 2019. His death leaves the mystery of the whereabouts of Falconio's body unsolved.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122551876,imgsize-836456,width-400,resizemode-4/122551876.jpg"

California Democrat rep Ro Khanna will file an amendment to an Act that would require Attorney General Pam Bondi to release Epstein's client list as the Donald Trump administration is already in a tough spot over the issue. Khanna said he will file an amendment to the GENIUS Act, a cryptocurrency bill slated to be marked up by the House Rules Committee on Tuesday. Axios reported that the amendment would require Bondi to ""retain, preserve and compile any records or evidence related to any investigation, prosecution or incarceration"" of Epstein.Bondi would then have to ""release and publish"" the records ""on a publicly available website"" within 30 days of the GENIUS Act being signed into law.But it's highly unlikely that Ro Khanna's amendment would make it to the House floor.“Why are the Epstein files still hidden? Who are the rich & powerful being protected?” Khanna wrote on social media Sunday while announcing his plans. A vote would “put every Congress member on record” about making the files public, he continued.Rep. Mark Veasey (D-Texas) also announced on social media that he’ll be introducing a resolution Monday demanding the release of the files.“Either [President Donald Trump] and his acolytes fueled the rumors of the significance of these Epstein files to help his campaign, or something is there!” he wrote, suggesting the possibility of a cover-up.The handling of the Epstein files created a major rift in the Donald Trump administration and FBI deputy director Dan Bongino was on the verge of resigning over his disagreement with Pam Bondi. Bondi overpromised for months about Epstein releases and then the administration announced that Epstein did not have any client list and hence, there would be no more investigation or prosecution in the case.“Dan Bongino is a very good guy. I’ve known him a long time. I’ve done his show many, many times.

Federal scrutiny and protest response



Legal challenges and local response







A major immigration raid at two marijuana farms in Southern California has resulted in more than 360 arrests, a death, and rising tensions between federal authorities and local officials.The operation took place last Thursday at Glass House Farms facilities in Camarillo and Carpinteria, northwest of Los Angeles.It has been described as one of the largest operations since President Donald Trump took office, according to the department of homeland security (DHS) secretary Kristi Noem.The DHS executed criminal search warrants at the two sites, with officers in tactical gear storming the greenhouses. The raids sparked confusion and fear among workers and nearby residents, many of whom gathered at the Camarillo location demanding information about their loved ones. One worker, 57-year-old Jaime Alanis, fell from a greenhouse roof while hiding and died two days later in hospital. His niece confirmed his death, noting that he had worked at the farm for a decade and was the sole provider for his wife and daughter in Mexico.Originally, federal officials said around 200 people had been arrested for alleged immigration violations. That number later increased to 361. Among those detained, four had prior convictions including rape and kidnapping.The federal government said it launched the raids to investigate suspected child labour, human trafficking , and abuse. DHS initially said 10 children were found on the property, later raising that number to 14. However, no charges have been filed, and the agency has not released details about the children, their ages, or their activities on site.Glass House Farms began in Carpinteria and later expanded to Camarillo, where it operates both cannabis and tomato greenhouses. State cannabis regulators said no minors were seen during a May inspection. Following a complaint, they reopened an investigation.The raids triggered protests, with tensions flaring between demonstrators and armed agents. Smoke filled the air as crowds clashed with authorities. Federal agents also arrested four US citizens accused of resisting or assaulting officers.The raids come amid growing backlash from immigrant advocates and local leaders. A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to halt broad immigration stops in seven California counties. The justice department has appealed, calling the order vague and difficult to enforce.Los Angeles mayor Karen Bass responded by signing an executive order to support affected communities. The city will work with partners to distribute emergency cash assistance through immigrant rights groups. The funds aim to support residents too scared to go to work or access public services. The city also plans to train staff and establish a police working group to prepare for future immigration actions.Officials say the federal government has not shared the full search warrant or offered evidence to back its claims of trafficking or abuse.","The operation took place last Thursday at Glass House Farms facilities in Camarillo and Carpinteria, northwest of Los Angeles.

Trump hails decision as ‘major victory’







The US Supreme Court has given the green light to President Donald Trump 's plan to dismantle the federal education department, allowing the administration to move forward with laying off nearly 1,400 employees.In a 6-3 decision on Monday, the justices paused a lower court ruling that had temporarily blocked the layoffs. The order, issued by US District Judge Myong Joun in Boston, had reversed the dismissals and raised doubts about Trump’s broader plan to shut down the department.The high court’s decision now allows the administration to resume one of Trump’s campaign pledges to dismantle the education department and shift its responsibilities back to individual states.The court’s three liberal justices dissented from the majority ruling, expressing concern over the impact of the layoffs and the wider implications for federal oversight of education.The Biden-appointed Judge Joun had previously granted a preliminary injunction against the move, saying it could cause “irreparable harm” to thousands of students and families who rely on federal education services. His ruling questioned the legality of bypassing Congress in shutting down a federal agency and freezing its operations.Trump responded to the ruling on social media, calling it a win for his education agenda. “This is a major victory for students and parents,” he wrote. “The failing Education Department will now go BACK TO THE STATES.”The administration has argued that states are better equipped to manage education without federal intervention and that local control would lead to more effective and tailored learning policies. Critics, however, say dismantling the department could leave millions of students without consistent oversight, especially in underserved communities.","The US Supreme Court has given the green light to President Donald Trump's plan to dismantle the federal education department.

Annabelle Handler Ghost Hunter Dead: Dan Rivera COLLAPSES During Chilling 'DEVILS ON THE RUN' Stop





Dan Rivera, a well-known paranormal investigator died on Sunday while touring with the infamous Annabelle doll in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, as confirmed by his tour organisers.Rivera was a US Army veteran and lead investigator with the New England Society for Psychic Research (NESPR). He was in the middle of his “Devils on the Run Tour” when emergency responders were called to his hotel. Despite efforts to revive him with CPR, he died at the scene. His exact cause of death remains unknown, New York post reported.Rivera was known for his appearances on paranormal television shows, including the Travel Channel’s “Most Haunted Places,” and for producing Netflix’s “28 Days Haunted.” He was touring with NESPR members to display Annabelle, a supposedly haunted doll made famous by paranormal legends.The tour had just completed a three-day sold-out stop in Gettysburg from Friday through Sunday, hosted at the Soldiers National Orphanage by Ghostly Images of Gettysburg Tours.Rivera often used social media, including popular TikTok videos, to promote the tour and share paranormal stories with a wide audience.Fellow paranormal investigator Ryan Buell paid tribute to Rivera.“I have so many amazing memories with this guy. Just as recently as two months ago, we traveled around the country and introduced a whole new generation to Ed and Lorraine Warren’s legacy,” Buell wrote on TikTok.Annabelle is linked to stories dating back to the 1970s. The Warrens claimed the doll was demonically possessed and responsible for disturbing activities, including moving on its own and causing harm. They moved it to the Connecticut museum for safekeeping.Ed and Lorraine Warren, who founded NESPR in 1952, gained fame investigating cases like the Amityville Horror. Their work inspired “The Conjuring” film series.After the deaths of Ed in 2006 and Lorraine in 2019, their daughter Judy and son-in-law Tony Spera took over the museum and NESPR. The museum closed to the public in 2019 due to local government regulations.","Dan Rivera, a well-known paranormal investigator died on Sunday while touring with the infamous Annabelle doll in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.

Powell’s resignation 'would be the right decision for America'







Florida Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna on Tuesday said that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s dismissal is imminent.The explosive claim comes amid mounting pressure from the Trump administration and ongoing speculation about a leadership change at one of the world’s most powerful central banks.The search for Powell’s replacement is now officially underway, according to US treasury secretary Scott Bessent. Bessent confirmed that “there’s a formal process that’s already starting” to find the next Federal Reserve chair, whose term expires in 2026.“There are a lot of good candidates inside and outside the Federal Reserve,"" he was quoted as saying to Bloomberg.Bessent also suggested that Powell should consider stepping down from the Fed entirely once his chairmanship ends to avoid confusion and maintain market stability.“Traditionally, the Fed chair also steps down as a governor,” Bessent said. “There’s been a lot of talk of a shadow Fed chair causing confusion in advance of his or her nomination. And I can tell you, I think it’d be very confusing for the market for a former Fed chair to stay on also,"" he added.However, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon appeared to push back against these ideas, stressing the importance of the Fed’s independence.After an earnings call, Dimon said, “I think the independence of the Fed is absolutely critical.” As reported by The Wall Street Journal, Dimon warned, “Playing around with the Fed can have adverse consequences, the absolute opposite of what you might be hoping for.”The Trump administration has been vocal in its desire for a Fed leader who favours lower interest rates and a more accommodative monetary policy. US President Donald Trump has publicly called for Powell to “resign immediately,” blaming him for not cutting interest rates aggressively enough and branding him “very bad for the country.” Trump argued, '“Every point [of interest] costs us $360 billion,” insisting rates should fall below 1%.Beyond verbal criticism, the White House, through Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought, has accused Powell of “gross mismanagement” and extravagance over a $2.5 billion renovation of the Fed’s headquarters. Letters from the White House questioned the necessity and legality of the project, suggesting these concerns could be grounds for removal. Other officials, such as Bill Pulte, head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, have publicly stated that Powell’s resignation “would be the right decision for America. ”Despite all this, Bessent emphasised that Trump has “numerous times” said he is not going to fire Powell. Powell himself has requested an inspector general review of the renovation project and reaffirmed his commitment to complete his term.As for who might succeed Powell, Bessent denied speculation about his own candidacy, saying he is “part of the decision-making process” but pointing out there are “a lot of good, strong candidates” both inside and outside the Federal Reserve.The Trump administration is reportedly aiming to announce a nominee as early as October or November.","US treasury secretary Scott Bessent says the search for Powell's replacement is now officially underway.

White House, Treasury defend savings







The White House on Tuesday unveiled an interactive map showing how much Americans across all 50 states are expected to save from US President Donald Trump’s newly signed legislation, the One Big, Beautiful Bill ActThe MAGA supremo's ambitious bill was signed into law on the Fourth of July after lots of scrutiny.The legislation was championed by Trump since his return to office in January. It delivers sweeping tax cuts and includes provisions to make earlier Trump-era cuts permanent.As part of the rollout, the White House released a state-by-state breakdown showcasing the expected wage boosts, tax exemptions, and savings for seniors and working families, reports Fox News.“We have officially made the Trump tax cuts permanent,” Trump said during the signing ceremony. “That’s the largest tax cut in the history of our country… After this kicks in, our country is going to be a rocket ship economically.”The interactive map focuses on key data points:In California, the most populous state, a family of four with two children could see a real wage increase of $4,900 to $8,800, and a real take-home pay boost of $8,500 to $12,500, according to the data. About 6 million seniors are expected to benefit from the tax exemption on Social Security, and around 4% of the workforce could gain from the no tax on tips provision.In Nebraska, residents can expect wage increases of $3,700 to $6,600 and take-home pay boosts of $7,300 to $10,300. Nearly 300,000 seniors may benefit from the Social Security tax break, and 29% of the state’s labour force could see gains from the tax exemption on overtime pay.On the East Coast, New Jersey families could see take-home pay increases of $8,600 to $12,700, while New Yorkers may benefit from $8,000 to $11,700 increases.The data regarding these financial aspects is present for all 50 US states on the White House interactive map on their website.The One Big, Beautiful Bill Act not only locks in permanent individual and business tax cuts from Trump’s 2017 tax law, but also introduces new tax breaks, including no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, and no tax on Social Security.The bill also repeals certain green energy tax credits introduced under former US President Joe Biden, allocates $350 billion for defence and immigration enforcement, and includes Medicaid reforms.House Speaker Mike Johnson played a crucial role in getting the bill through Congress, though the vote wasn’t without resistance. A handful of Republicans, including Senator Rand Paul and Representative Thomas Massie, opposed the measure due to its $5 trillion debt ceiling increase.Tech mogul Elon Musk, once a Trump ally, also publicly opposed the legislation, urging lawmakers to “kill the bill” over concerns about the rising national debt.Trump and US treasury secretary Scott Bessent have defended the bill’s impact.“The bill prevents a $4.5 trillion tax hike on the American people,” Bessent wrote. “This will allow the average worker to keep an additional $4,000 to $7,200 in annual real wages… and allow the average family of four to keep an additional $7,600 to $10,900 in take-home pay.”“Add to this the president’s ambitious deregulation agenda… these savings are the difference between being able to make a mortgage payment, buy a car, or send a child to college,” he added.A new White House calculator has also been launched to help Americans estimate their personal savings from the bill","The White House on Tuesday unveiled an interactive map showing how much Americans across all 50 states are expected to save from the One Big, Beautiful Bill Act.

US House Speaker Mike Johnson has called on the Justice Department to release all documents related to Jeffrey Epstein , the disgraced financier who died in federal custody in 2019 while facing sex-trafficking charges.In an interview on Tuesday with podcaster Benny Johnson, Mike said: “It’s a very delicate subject, but we should put everything out there and let the people decide it.”Johnson’s remarks marked a rare public disagreement with US President Donald Trump , his close ally in Congress, over an issue that has angered many in Trump’s conservative base, as reported by The Guardian.Trump has faced criticism from his supporters for failing to make public all information about Epstein, who allegedly had ties to many powerful figures. Last week, the justice department concluded that Epstein’s death was a suicide and announced that no list of clients would be released, rejecting conspiracy theories.Conservative allies of Trump have accused him and US attorney general Pam Bondi of handling the case poorly.During the interview, Speaker John also referred to Bondi’s earlier claim on Fox News that she had Epstein’s client list on her desk to review: “She needs to come forward and explain that to everybody.We need the DOJ focusing on major priorities. So let’s get this thing resolved.”Earlier on Tuesday, House Republicans voted down a proposal from Democrats. The proposal would have added a rule to a new law that would require the justice department to release Epstein-related files.Despite this setback, Democrats say they will keep pushing the issue. Members of the House Judiciary Committee have called on its Republican chair, Representative Jim Jordan, a Trump ally, to hold hearings with Bondi, her deputy and FBI leaders to answer questions about Epstein.Speaking to reporters before leaving the White House for Pittsburgh on Tuesday, Trump defended Bondi but suggested she could choose to release more documents: “She’s handled it very well, and it’s going to be up to her. Whatever she thinks is credible, she should release.”When NBC News asked Bondi about Trump's MAGA allies' frustration with how she has handled the case, she shifted the focus to other issues: “We’re going to fight to keep America safe again. We’ve got a war on drugs. We’ve got a war on human trafficking. We’ve got cartels in this country … we have foreign adversaries around this world as well, and we’re all going to work together as a team.”","US House Speaker Mike Johnson has called on the Justice Department to release all documents related to Jeffrey Epstein.

'Pretty boring stuff': Donald Trump downplays 'fascination' surrounding Epstein files; blames ‘bad people’ for keeping it alive,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/pretty-boring-stuff-donald-trump-downplays-fascination-surrounding-epstein-files-blames-bad-people-for-keeping-it-alive/articleshow/122542816.cms,"



US President Donald Trump on Tuesday dismissed renewed interest in the Jeffrey Epstein case, calling it “pretty boring stuff” and saying he didn’t understand why many of his own supporters were so focused on it.Speaking to reporters in Pennsylvania after an event, Trump reacted to questions about ongoing uproar within his base following the release of a Justice department and FBI memo last week. The memo said Epstein had no client list and confirmed he died by suicide in his New York jail cell in 2019.“I don’t understand it, why they would be so interested. He’s been dead for a long time. He was never a big factor in terms of life. I don’t understand what the interest and what the fascination is. I really don’t. And the credible information has been given,” Trump said.He added, “I don’t understand why the Jeffrey Epstein case would be of interest to anybody. It’s pretty boring stuff. It’s sordid, but it’s boring. And I don’t understand why it keeps going. I think really only pretty bad people, including fake news, want to keep something like that going.”Despite Trump's remarks, many within the MAGA movement remain unsatisfied with the government’s findings. The absence of a ""client list"" in the memo has fuelled speculation among conspiracy theorists, who have long believed that high-profile Democrats and celebrities were connected to pedophile Epstein’s alleged sex trafficking network.Anger has also been directed at US attorney general Pam Bondi, with people for her removal over what they claim is a lack of transparency around the Epstein files. Bondi had previously said in a February interview that an Epstein client list was “sitting on” her “desk” for review. She has since clarified that she was referring more broadly to files connected to the case.On Tuesday, Trump defended Bondi but said she should move forward with any disclosures that can be verified.“But she’s handled it very well, and it’s going to be up to her whatever she thinks is credible, she should release,” Trump said.In early June, tech billionaire Elon Musk and Trump's former right-hand man reignited controversy by suggesting that the MAGA chief's name appears in the unreleased Epstein files, claiming this was the real reason they had not been made public.Musk first made the allegation on X, saying ,“Time to drop the really big bomb… @realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files,” before later deleting the post. He has since called on the White House to release all related documents, demanding full transparency.Epstein had faced multiple accusations of trafficking underage girls and was known to associate with powerful figures such as Trump, former US President Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew of Britain, and several wealthy elites. His long-time associate Ghislaine Maxwell was convicted in 2021 for her role in facilitating the abuse. His death is still debated by many, with conspiracy theories claiming he was murdered to protect high-profile individuals. Despite official rulings that he died by suicide in his New York jail cell in 2019, questions around security failures and missing footage have fuelled public suspicion and kept the controversy alive.",President Donald Trump said he didn't understand renewed interest in the Jeffrey Epstein case.

The Pentagon has ordered 2,000 National Guard troops to leave Los Angeles, scaling down a deployment that began in response to protests against the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.The decision to withdraw nearly half of the soldiers stationed in the city was made on Tuesday amid ongoing tensions.About 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines had been stationed across LA since early June.Officials did not provide a clear reason for the sudden move, but it appeared to be a step back from the heavy military presence that had previously drawn criticism from LA mayor Karen Bass and California governor Gavin Newsom.The Trump administration’s decision to deploy troops had sparked widespread protests. On June 8, demonstrators flooded city streets, blocked a major freeway, and clashed with police using rubber bullets, tear gas, and flash bangs. In the chaos, several Waymo driverless cars were set on fire.The unrest continued the following day, as officers pushed protesters using flash bangs and projectiles. Bystanders, including restaurant workers, rushed to get out of the way.In response, mayor Karen Bass imposed a week-long curfew.By Tuesday afternoon, there was no sign of military presence at the downtown federal complex, which had been the centre of early protests. National Guard troops had first secured the area before Marines were assigned to protect federal buildings. Some soldiers had also helped with immigration operations in the city.Newsom had strongly opposed the deployment and sued the federal government, arguing it violated both state rights and the Posse Comitatus Act, which restricts the military from performing law enforcement duties on American soil.Although a federal judge first ruled in favour of Newsom, a higher court later overturned the decision, letting the federal government keep control of the Guard. The court is expected to hear more arguments next month.In a statement following the Pentagon’s decision, Newsom criticised the ongoing mission. “The National Guard’s deployment to Los Angeles County has pulled troops away from their families and civilian work to serve as political pawns for the President,” he said.He added, “We call on Trump and the Department of Defense to end this theatre and send everyone home now.”The withdrawal of troops follows last week’s heavily criticised federal operation at MacArthur Park, where troops and agents arrived with guns and horses. Department of homeland security (DHS) declined to explain the mission or confirm any arrests, with locals accusing the move of being a show of intimidation.","About 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines had been stationed across LA since early June.

White House security breach: ‘Phone’ was thrown over the fence; lockdown imposed briefly,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/white-house-security-breach-phone-was-thrown-over-the-fence-lockdown-imposed-briefly/articleshow/122537329.cms,"ANI file photo





The White House was temporarily put under lockdown on Tuesday after a “phone” was thrown over the security fence. ""Somebody threw their phone over the fence"", confirmed the press secretary Karoline Leavitt.This immediately prompted security measures by Secret Service agents as they responded to reports of an object being thrown which appeared to be a “phone”, over the North Lawn fence around midday, reported ANI.Members of the press corps awaiting education secretary Linda McMahon’s appearance on Fox News were swiftly escorted into the James S. Brady Briefing Room as agents secured the area, prohibiting access.The Secret Service imposed a full lockdown of the White House grounds and temporarily shut down Pennsylvania Avenue to traffic. By 11.56 am (local time), the security measures were lifted, and journalists were allowed back onto the North Lawn.Reporters had reassembled in the Palm Room by 12.20 pm (local time) before the US President Donald Trump’s scheduled departure for an event in Pennsylvania.The White House has not issued an official statement regarding the security breach as of yet.This is not the first instance of a security breach in the White House. Earlier this year a child had crawled his way through the fence of north lawn and tried to enter the White House. “Officers quickly reunited the child with their parents without incident,” said Anthony Guglielmi a Secret Service spokesperson, through a social media post.","The White House was temporarily put under lockdown on Tuesday after a “phone” was thrown over the security fence.

‘Could Spark World War III’: NATO Member Slams EU's Anti-Russia Sanctions As ‘Dangerous’





US President Donald Trump has said that Attorney General Pam Bondi should release “whatever she thinks is credible” on Tuesday regarding the Jeffrey Epstein files as pressure from his MAGA supporters mount.Speaking to reporters as he left the White House, Trump said he received a briefing on the justice department and FBI review of the Epstein files. The briefing occurred prior to the release of the DOJ and FBI memo last week.The review found no evidence that Epstein maintained a “client list” of associates, and no additional charges are expected. As part of the investigation, the department also released several hours of footage, which officials say further supports the conclusion that Epstein died by suicide while in custody in his Manhattan jail cell in 2019.A journalist from ABC news, Katherine Faulders had asked Trump regarding what Bondi informed him about the review ""specifically, did she tell you at all that your name appeared in the files?"" To which Trump responded ""No, no, she's -- she's given us just a very quick briefing.”""And in terms of the credibility of the different things that they've seen, and I would say that, you know, these files were made up by Comey, they were made up by Obama, they were made up by the Biden -- and you know, we and we went through years of that with the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax, with all of the different things that we had to go through,"" he added.""We've gone through years of it, but she's handled it very well, and it's going to be up to her,"" Trump said, referring to Bondi. ""Whatever she thinks is credible, she should release.""Trump is facing backlash from his MAGA base over how his administration has managed the release of the Epstein files. There have been calls for Bondi’s resignation to which she responded on Tuesday, ""I'm going to be here for as long as the president wants me here, and I believe he's made that crystal clear.""“Let Pam Bondi do her job-she’s great!” Trump wrote on Truth Social earlier urging for unity within the MAGA movement amid reignition of controversy over the Epstein files. “We’re on one Team, MAGA, and I don’t like what’s happening,” he wrote.""I was with [FBI] Director [Kash] Patel all morning and we are committed to keeping America safe, making America safe, working with our incredible partners at DEA, FBI, ATF, US Marshals to do everything we can to make America safe and that's what we're focused on,"" said Bondi addressing an event at the Drug Enforcement Administration, reports ABC.Earlier reports also suggested that Kash Patel, the director of FBI was frustrated with Bondi for not releasing more information related to the Epstein files and reportedly told associates he wanted her removed from her position.For years, Patel and Dan Bongino, the deputy director of FBI have suggested that more information ought to be revealed regarding the Epstein case.The FBI and DOJ had issued a joint memo earlier stating that Epstein had died by suicide and there was no “client list.”","President Donald Trump has said that Attorney General Pam Bondi should release “whatever she thinks is credible” on Tuesday regarding the Jeffrey Epstein files.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan said on Monday it was creating a national paramilitary force, prompting concern among opposition parties and human rights groups that it could be used as a tool of political repression.The move turns an existing paramilitary force deployed on Pakistan’s northwestern border with Afghanistan into a national security force that will be called the Federal Constabulary, state minister for the interior Talal Chaudhry told a press conference in the eastern city of Faisalabad. Its new duties will include internal security, riot control and counter-terrorism, according to a copy of the amended law reported by the local Dunya News TV.The announcement came after Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party of former jailed PM Imran Khan said it would stage nationwide protests starting on Aug 5, the second anniversary of his arrest. Several such protests since his Aug 2023 arrest have turned violent, in some cases paralysing the capital Islamabad for days.“This will be a new force. This will be a stronger force. We need this force for internal security,” Chaudhry said, adding that President Asif Ali Zardari had already approved amendments in the law introducing changes in the paramilitary force.The new force replaces the Frontier Constabulary (FC), whose cadres were previously recruited only from tribes in the northwestern province, Chaudhry said.Training of the new force will bring it into line with other national law enforcement agencies, he added. Khan’s party spokesperson Zulfikar Bukhari said the changes should be subject to parliamentary discussion.The new force “should not be used as a gimmick to silence political opponents, as has been previously witnessed when the government applied such laws against a large number of the PTI leadership and supporters,” he said. His concern was echoed by Haris Khalique, secretary of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, an independent body. “We are alarmed by the changes being made to the security and law enforcement structure of the country without any debate in parliament,” Khalique said.REUTERS","The move turns an existing paramilitary force deployed on Pakistan’s northwestern border with Afghanistan into a national security force.

Poliovirus found in 20 Pakistani districts amid rising vaccine refusals: New sewage data signals resurgence; 13th polio case confirmed in 2025,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/poliovirus-found-in-20-pakistani-districts-amid-rising-vaccine-refusals-new-sewage-data-signals-resurgence-13th-polio-case-confirmed-in-2025/articleshow/122421011.cms,"



Pakistan's battle against polio has hit a fresh setback, with the deadly virus detected in sewage samples across 20 districts, including the capital, just as the country grapples with rising vaccine refusal rates.According to ARY News, citing the National Reference Laboratory, 28 sewage samples collected between May 8 and June 17 tested positive for Wild Poliovirus Type 1 (WPV1). The presence of the virus was confirmed in major urban centres such as Lahore, Karachi, and Islamabad, as well as in districts across Sindh, Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir.Sindh reported the highest contamination, with 14 positive samples from 10 districts. Lahore recorded three cases, while Islamabad and four districts in KP also registered positive samples. In Balochistan, the virus was found in Mastung, Khuzdar, and Sibi. Mirpur in PoJK also showed signs of the virus.This alarming development follows Pakistan’s second national polio vaccination drive earlier this year, which saw over 60,000 refusals, 39,000 of them in Karachi alone. These refusals, officials say, are now posing a major roadblock to the country’s eradication efforts.“We’re not just fighting a virus; we’re battling misinformation and mistrust,” a senior health official told ARY News.Pakistan remains one of only two countries where polio is still endemic, the other being Afghanistan. With the confirmation of another new case this week, the total number of polio cases in the country has reached 13 so far in 2025.Health experts warn that the virus spreads primarily through contaminated water or food and can cause paralysis or death. There is no cure for polio, making vaccination the only defense. The World Health Organisation emphasises that multiple oral doses are needed to protect children under five, the group most vulnerable to the disease.Despite ongoing national campaigns, large pockets in southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa remain difficult to access for vaccination teams, leaving thousands of children at risk.As the virus resurfaces in urban and rural sewers alike, officials say the next phase in Pakistan’s anti-polio war must tackle both the virus, and vaccine hesitancy, with equal urgency.","Sindh reported the highest contamination, with 14 positive samples from 10 districts.

Pakistan’s economic performance under the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) $7 billion loan programme has been “strong so far”, according to Mahir Binici, the IMF’s Resident Representative for Pakistan, reported PTI.Speaking at a lecture hosted by the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) in Islamabad on Sunday, Binici said Pakistan’s first review under the three-year Extended Fund Facility (EFF), approved in July 2024, was successfully completed by the IMF Executive Board in May.The EFF aims to cement macroeconomic stability and lay the groundwork for “stronger, more inclusive and resilient growth,” he said. So far, Pakistan has received two instalments under the programme, with the government implementing agreed policy measures aimed at fiscal discipline and investor confidence.“Early policy measures have helped restore macroeconomic stability and rebuild investor confidence, despite persistent external challenges,” Binici noted.He stressed the importance of structural reforms to ensure long-term economic sustainability, including strengthening tax equity, improving the business climate, and encouraging private-sector-led investment.Binici also welcomed Pakistan’s commitment to climate-related reforms under the $1.3 billion Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF), approved in March.The RSF supports projects focused on disaster preparedness, efficient water use, green investments, and better climate data transparency.“Support through the RSF will not only strengthen Pakistan’s climate resilience but also help unlock green investments and foster a more climate-conscious economic trajectory,” he said.On regional prospects, Binici said economic growth in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, including Pakistan, was expected to improve in 2025 and beyond. However, he warned that global economic uncertainty remains high due to trade tensions, geopolitical fragmentation, and weakening cooperation.","Pakistan's economic performance under IMF's $7 billion loan programme has been'strong so far' Mahir Binici, the IMF’s Resident Representative for Pakistan, spoke at a lecture in Islamabad.

Karachi blackout protest chokes city traffic: Punjab Colony residents block roads after 24-hour outage; report points to systemic collapse,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/karachi-blackout-protest-chokes-city-traffic-punjab-colony-residents-block-roads-after-24-hour-outage-report-points-to-systemic-collapse/articleshow/122418234.cms,"



A protest over a prolonged power outage in Karachi’s Punjab Colony spiraled into city-wide traffic chaos on Saturday, underscoring what many see as chronic governance failure and energy mismanagement in Pakistan, Dawn reported.Residents of an 80-flat, 10-storey building blocked a major road near Punjab Chowrangi after going more than 24 hours without electricity. Power had reportedly been out since 11 am Friday, and despite repeated complaints, K-Electric, Karachi’s sole power distributor, allegedly failed to respond.The resulting sit-in crippled traffic on Defence Road and nearby areas. Long queues of trucks and tankers vital to Karachi Port were stalled from Qayyumabad to the KPT Flyover. Major intersections like Boat Basin, Gizri, and Hino Chowrangi were brought to a standstill, leaving thousands of commuters stranded, according to Dawn.The outage reportedly followed K-Electric’s anti-theft operation in the adjacent P&T Colony. Protesters claimed legal connections were also cut off in the sweep, with no clear procedure followed. KE, however, described the protestors as ""miscreants"" attempting to restore illegal connections and said their teams were attacked during the operation, allegedly linked to a cable TV network.No evidence was provided implicating all affected residents in theft.While KE later claimed to have restored power to parts of the area, the larger issue remains unresolved. The incident highlights Pakistan’s ongoing struggle to provide reliable electricity, exacerbated by outdated infrastructure and lack of accountability in power distribution.As Dawn noted, the crisis is less about one blackout and more a reflection of systemic dysfunction, where citizens bear the brunt of institutional failure.","Residents of an 80-flat, 10-storey building blocked a major road near Punjab Chowrangi after going more than 24 hours without electricity.

PESHAWAR: An under-construction government primary school for girls in Pakistan's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province was damaged in an IED blast by unknown militants, police said on Friday.No casualties were reported as the building was unoccupied at the time of the explosion.Militants had planted an explosive material inside the premises of the Azaan Javed Primary School in Baka Khel police jurisdiction of Bannu district.The device was detonated with a powerful blast, causing substantial structural damage to the building.An FIR has been registered and forensic teams have been deployed to collect evidence from the blast site, police said.Authorities have condemned the attack as an attempt to derail educational development in the region.According to a report by the Lowy Institute, an Australian think tank, more than 1,100 girls' schools have been destroyed in the tribal areas between 2007 to 2017, with teachers and young students also targeted.Before an all-out military operation launched by Pakistan's security forces in 2014, the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) carried out hundreds of attacks on girls' schools in the tribal areas and settled districts of the northwestern province from its stronghold in Swat district.After the crackdown, TTP militants fled to Afghanistan and began to orchestrate cross border attacks from their new sanctuaries.The Taliban takeover of Kabul has emboldened the TTP, which is fighting to regain control of its strongholds in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.Since the takeover of Afghanistan in 2021, the Taliban has banned girls from attending school beyond the sixth grade and banned women from universities.Pakistani Taliban, who are ideologically closer to Afghan Taliban, are trying to enforce a similar anti-education and theocratic agenda in Pakistan's tribal areas by force.The youngest Nobel Prize laureate, Malala Yousafzai, who is from Swat district, was shot in the face when she was 14 by TTP gunmen in 2012 as she wanted to pursue her education.","Militants planted an explosive material inside the premises of the Azaan Javed Primary School.

Nine people were shot dead by rebels in Pakistan’s Balochistan province late Thursday after they were pulled off passenger buses. The victims were targeted based on their identity cards showing Punjab origins, as per reports.According to Dawn, two buses travelling from Quetta to Punjab were intercepted near Sur-Dakai along the Loralai-Zhob highway. Armed men reportedly blocked the road, boarded the vehicles, and began checking passengers’ CNICs.Those identified as residents of Punjab were taken off at gunpoint and later killed. “The terrorists forced the two passenger buses to stop on a highway and pulled nine passengers out. They took them in an area nearby and killed all of them,” said local official Naveed Alam, speaking to AFP.District administrator Saadat Hussain confirmed that the bodies were later recovered from the roadside. “The forces found the dead bodies all belong to different areas of Punjab,” he told AFP.“The terrorists must have taken the passengers’ identification documents with them,” AC Alam told Dawn.While no group initially claimed responsibility, the Balochistan Liberation Front (BLA) later took credit. The group has waged a long-running insurgency against the Pakistani state, frequently targeting non-Baloch civilians and military personnel.The Baloch insurgency, which seeks independence from Islamabad, has intensified in recent years despite claims by Pakistani authorities that it is under control. President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the killings, blaming “terrorists from the outlawed BLA” for seeking to destabilise the country.The killings echo a similar attack last year in which 23 passengers were killed.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s political temperature spiked on Thursday after Jemima Goldsmith, ex-wife of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan , accused the govt of denying their sons the right to speak with their father and threatening them with arrest if they attempt to visit the country.In a strongly worded post on X, Goldsmith said her sons, Sulaiman and Qasim Khan, have not been allowed to speak to Imran, who has been held in solitary confinement in Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail for nearly two years.“Pakistan’s govt has now said if they go there to try to see him, they too will be arrested and put behind bars,” she wrote. “This isn’t politics. It’s a personal vendetta.”Her intervention has triggered widespread reactions both domestically and abroad, with PTI accusing govt of using intimidation tactics ahead of a major protest planned for Aug 5 to mark two years of Khan’s incarceration.Reports suggest the sons, currently based in the UK, were planning to join the protest movement. However, Goldsmith’s statement appears to signal serious concern about their safety.Adviser to the Prime Minister on political affairs Rana Sanaullah, responding to the claims, said: “Why won’t they be arrested? If they come to lead a violent movement, the consequences will follow.” Law minister Aqeel Malik also warned that entry could be denied if their intent is to “spread discord”.Goldsmith’s post has reignited criticism of Khan’s detention conditions, with human rights groups raising an alarm over his prolonged solitary confinement — reportedly 22 hours a day — and limited access to lawyers and family. Khan’s son Qasim also weighed in, posting: “My father... has now spent over 700 days in prison – held in solitary confinement.”The row comes amid intense political speculation in Islamabad, including unconfirmed reports of President Asif Ali Zardari ’s possible resignation and a rumoured meeting between Khan and longtime rival Nawaz Sharif in jail.Interior minister Mohsin Naqvi has rejected the reports, calling them part of a “malicious foreign campaign” and denying claims that Army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir is being considered for the presidency under a proposed shift to a presidential system, a move Khan has condemned as “monarchic”.Khan, who faces over 150 legal cases, has rejected any negotiations with the Shehbaz Sharif govt.

ISLAMABAD: Alphabet-owned YouTube has told more than two dozen critics of the Pakistani govt that it is considering blocking their channels after a local court sought to ban them for being ""anti-state"".The channels that could be blocked include that of the main opposition party, of its chief, jailed former PM Imran Khan, and journalists critical of govt, according to a June 24 court order. The judicial magistrate court in Islamabad said it was seeking the ban after national cyber crime investigation agency criticised the channels in a report for ""sharing highly provocative and derogatory contents against state institutions and officials of state of Pakistan"".Rights campaigners say any ban would further undermine free speech in Pakistan, where authorities are accused of stifling newspapers and television, and social media is seen as one of the few outlets for dissent. YouTube told 27 content creators their channels could be taken down if they did not comply with the court orders. State minister for interior Talal Chaudhry said the creators would also face criminal charges. ""It's not only about anchors getting fired or YouTube channels getting banned. It's what they are not allowing to be told and the rights abuse they are trying to hide from the world,"" said a spokesman for Khan's PTI.","YouTube has told more than two dozen critics of the Pakistani govt that it is considering blocking their channels.

Beijing 'Open To Arming' Allies





ISLAMABAD: In a rare show of coordinated praise, senior defence officials from China and Turkiye have commended the combat readiness and operational capability of the Pakistan Air Force following last month’s four-day conflict with India, a development seen in Islamabad as quiet validation of its evolving airpower doctrine.In back-to-back high-level visits to Air Headquarters in Islamabad this week, top officials from the People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) and the Turkish ministry of defence hailed PAF’s “decisive” response and “battle-proven” performance during the May clashes.China’s Chief of Air Staff, Lt Gen Wang Gang, met PAF chief Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu on Tuesday and described Pakistan’s aerial actions as “a textbook example of precision, discipline and courage in the face of unprovoked aggression”. He praised PAF’s integration of multi-domain operations (MDOs), calling it a “hallmark of modern air warfare”, and expressed interest in adopting elements of PAF’s doctrine for the PLAAF.A day later, on Wednesday, Turkiye defence minister Yaşar Güler offered similar praise. Calling the PAF’s performance “exceptional”, Güler lauded Sidhu’s “insightful leadership” and highlighted PAF’s role in the “resolute defence of national sovereignty”.He also proposed expanded cooperation in training, unmanned aerial systems, and disruptive technologies.Güler’s visit coincided with the arrival of Turkiye foreign minister Hakan Fidan on Wednesday, signalling coordinated diplomatic and military outreach as Pakistan seeks to shore up support from key allies.Neither China nor Turkiye elaborated on the details of the May conflict — downplayed by Islamabad and denied outright by New Delhi — but both echoed Pakistan’s military narrative, offering a diplomatic boost as Islamabad contends with regional isolation and growing India-West defence ties.Both delegations were briefed on PAF’s restructured posture, including its focus on AI-driven targeting and cyber-electronic warfare. PLAAF officials reportedly showed strong interest in the JF-17 Block III, a jointly developed fighter jet now equipped with AESA (active electronically scanned array) radar and advanced avionics.The Turkish side proposed joint working groups to fast-track industry-to-industry ties — part of Ankara’s push to expand its defence footprint in South Asia amid rising collaboration with Pakistan on drones, pilot training, and aerospace development.The rare twin endorsements from two of Pakistan’s closest allies reflect a shifting regional balance, with China and Turkiye increasingly positioning themselves as strategic counterweights to India’s deepening ties with the US, France and Israel.While India denies any aerial losses, the external praise for PAF suggests otherwise, raising questions about whether these visits signal deeper strategic alignment or simply calculated shows of support.Islamabad and Ankara on Wednesday agreed to boost their cooperation in a range of sectors, including defence, trade, energy and infrastructure, aiming to enhance bilateral trade volume to $5 billion. This was agreed during talks between Fidan and Guler with Pakistan foreign minister Ishaq Dar here. “Pakistan would like to benefit from Turkiye’s expertise and experiences in this (defence) field,” Dar said. “We are actively engaged in different activities, including capacity building and counterterrorism,” Dar said, describing Turkiye as a ""trusted friend"" and a ""reliable brother”. ""We are pursuing the establishment of a Special Economic Zone dedicated to Turkish entrepreneurs at Karachi,” Dar said. He also mentioned finalising the revival of the Istanbul-Tehran-Islamabad train.",Senior defence officials from China and Turkiye have commended the combat readiness and operational capability of the Pakistan Air Force.

DHAKA: In yet another development showcasing growing social intolerance in Bangladesh, the ancestral home of iconic filmmaker Satyajit Ray in Dhaka is being demolished to make way for a new semi-concrete structure, the local media reported Tuesday.Located on Horikishore Ray Chowdhury Road in the city, the century-old house was home to Upendrakishore Ray Chowdhury. Upendrakishore, a prominent 19th-century litterateur in his own right besides being a painter and publisher, was the father of celebrated poet Sukumar Ray and grandfather of filmmaker Satyajit Ray.A semi-concrete structure with several rooms will be built to house a Shishu Academy at the historically-significant building, the country's leading media outlet 'Daily Star' reported. According to reports, the property - which was built by Upendrakishore more than a century ago and previously housed the Mymensingh Shishu Academy - fell into a state of disrepair after years of neglect by the authorities.The newspaper said that local residents have expressed their concerns over the decision, citing that the demolition will wipe out the legacy of the Ray dynasty in Mymensingh city. However, the authorities insist that the demolition is being carried out in accordance with proper procedures and ""necessary approvals"".Officials from Dhaka's Department of Archeology, while agreeing that the property remains an archeological heritage, admitted that their repeated requests to protect the building have gone unheard.Expressing her anguish, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee posted on X: ""The Ray family is one of the most prominent torchbearers of Bengal's culture. Upendrakishore was among the pillars of the Bengal Renaissance. I feel this house is inextricably linked to Bengal's cultural history. I appeal to the Bangladeshi government and to all right-thinking people of that country to preserve this edifice of rich tradition. The Indian government should also intervene.""In New Delhi, MEA expressed deep regret that the property was being demolished. ""Given the building's landmark status symbolising Bangla cultural renaissance, it would be preferable to reconsider the demolition and examine options for its repair and reconstruction as a museum of literature and a symbol of the shared culture of India and Bangladesh,"" said ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal, adding that the Indian govt was willing to extend assistance for the purpose.","The ancestral home of iconic filmmaker Satyajit Ray in Dhaka is being demolished to make way for a new semi-concrete structure.

PHNOM PENH: Cambodia's military will begin conscripting civilians next year, Prime Minister Hun Manet said Monday, citing rising tensions with Thailand as the reason for activating a long-dormant mandatory enlistment law.Cambodia's parliament in 2006 approved a law that would require all Cambodians aged 18 to 30 to serve in the military for 18 months, although it has never been enforced.Relations with neighbouring Thailand have been tense since May, when a long-standing territorial dispute boiled over into cross-border clashes, killing one Cambodian soldier.""This episode of confrontation is a lesson for us and is an opportunity for us to review, assess, and set our targets to reform our military,"" Hun Manet said.""From 2026, the military conscription law will be implemented,"" he told a ceremony at the Royal Gendarmerie Training Centre in central Kampong Chhnang province.Hun Manet said the service period would be extended from the 18 months outlined in the legislation passed two decades ago to 24 months, and pledged to ""look at increasing"" Cambodia's defence budget.""Our national defence, the building of our military, is not to invade anybody's territory but it is to protect our territory,"" he added.The Cambodian soldier was killed by Thai troops in a firefight in a disputed area known as the Emerald Triangle, where the borders of both countries and Laos meet.The incident soured relations between Phnom Penh and Bangkok -- causing the closure of border crossings as Cambodia banned fuel and gas imports from Thailand.It also caused a domestic political crisis in Thailand, where Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra has been suspended from office pending an ethics probe over her conduct during the row.A diplomatic call between Paeotongtarn and Hun Manet's father, former leader Hun Sen, was leaked from the Cambodian side, sparking a judicial investigation.Neighbouring Thailand already has military conscription for young and able-bodied men, who enter a lottery to determine whether they have to serve.","Cambodia's parliament in 2006 approved a law that would require all Cambodians aged 18 to 30 to serve in the military for 18 months.

More than 500 people, including civilians and soldiers, crossed into Thailand on Saturday after ethnic fighters launched an attack on a military base in Myanmar, according to the Thai army.Myanmar has been locked in civil conflict since the 2021 military coup, with the junta facing resistance from ethnic armed groups and pro-democracy forces.Saturday’s assault was carried out by the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA), which targeted a military base in Kayin state at around 3 pm local time (0800 GMT), the Thai military said in a statement.“The Myanmar soldiers attempted to resist and called for supporting firepower to defend their position but were ultimately unable to hold the line,” the statement said.Thai officials said around 100 Myanmar soldiers and 467 civilians crossed into Thailand. They were disarmed and given medical help and humanitarian aid by Thai military and police.Thai forces have stepped up patrols along the border in western Tak province, warning of a possible “violation of sovereignty by foreign armed forces”.Saw Thamain Tun, a leader of the KNLA’s political wing, confirmed the fighting near the border and said joint forces had “seized some front posts” from the Myanmar army.“Some (Myanmar troops) defected to our joint forces, but some of them ran into Thailand,” he told AFP.Karen armed groups have long opposed the military and now play a major role in resisting junta control in the border regions.The civil war has displaced large numbers of people, with around 81,000 refugees or asylum seekers from Myanmar currently in Thailand, according to the United Nations.The KNLA has been fighting for decades for greater autonomy for the Karen people in southeastern Myanmar.","More than 500 people, including civilians and soldiers, crossed into Thailand on Saturday.

Bangladesh’s interim government on Thursday officially revoked a long-standing directive from the Sheikh Hasina administration that required public officials to address her and other senior women officials as “sir. ” The order, in effect for nearly 16 years, was deemed ‘inappropriate’ by the Yunus- led government.The decision was announced by chief adviser of the government of Bangladesh in a post on X, following a meeting of the advisory council in Dhaka.

A 4.5 magnitude earthquake struck Myanmar on Friday, said the National center for seismology (NCS). The tremor occurred at a depth of 101 km, with its epicenter at 25.76 N latitude and 95.26 E longitude.There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries.This was the third earthquake to hit the country in July. Earlier, on July 7, a 4.6 magnitude earthquake shook the region at 10.40 am IST. The quake struck at a depth of 85 km.On July 3, another earthquake of magnitude 4.1 hit Myanmar early morning. Shallow earthquakes are generally more dangerous due to the stronger ground shaking they produce, potentially causing more damage and casualties.Myanmar has been facing increased seismic activity in recent months. On March 28, the country was hit by powerful earthquakes measuring 7.7 and 6.4 in central regions. In the aftermath, the world health organisation (WHO) raised concerns about rising health threats among displaced populations, including tuberculosis (TB), HIV, and vector- and water-borne diseases, as reported by ANI.Myanmar is highly vulnerable to moderate and large magnitude earthquakes, as well as tsunami threats along its coastline. The Sagaing Fault, which runs through key regions such as Sagaing, Mandalay, Bago, and Yangon, increases the seismic risk for nearly half of the country’s population.Despite being some distance from the fault, Yangon remains at significant risk due to its dense population. Historical records show that an earthquake in Bago in 1903 with a magnitude of 7.0 also impacted Yangon.","A 4.5 magnitude earthquake struck Myanmar on Friday.

LONDON: Tributes are pouring in from across the UK for Fauja Singh, the oldest marathon runner in the world, who died on Monday after being hit by a car in his Punjab village at the age of 114.Writer and filmmaker Captain Jay Singh-Sohal told TOI: “I met him many times. He was a very inspiring figure who took great pride in doing what he was doing and in maintaining his Sikh identity with a turban and uncut beard, and in turn, he inspired many others. Not only did he inspire people of all ages to be physically active, but he also promoted the Sikh identity and took pride in doing so and showing young Sikhs, in particular, that their religious adherence was not a barrier to achieving great things. ”Fauja Singh discovered running in his 80s as a means of remaining active and lifting boredom as he became older. He quickly became a celebrity.“He was very down-to-earth and humble regardless of his fame. He ate very simply — just daal and rice. His discipline, simple living, and deep humility left a lasting mark on me,” said MP Preet Kaur Gill.MP Tanmanjeet Singh said he would be “sorely missed.”“Despite his extraordinary and record-breaking achievements, he was completely down to earth and incredibly generous with his time,” recalled Hardeep Singh, deputy-director, Network of Sikh Organisations.Nick Bitel, London Marathon Group CEO, said: “Fauja Singh was an incredible, inspirational human being who epitomised the Spirit of the London Marathon. Our thoughts are with his family and friends.”Fauja Singh, now British, had been living back in Beas Pind, his birth village near Jalandhar, for the past five years, ever since the pandemic, when the accident happened.He was born in 1911 and had six children. One daughter died during childbirth in the 1980s and soon after that, his wife, Gian Kaur, died, and then his son, Kuldeep, died in an accident in front of him. That led to depression and so he came to the UK to stay with his son, Sukhjinder, and lived in Ilford. “He was a bit bored in an alien country where, at that time, there was not much Punjabi media. He went back to India to his family and then they sent him back to the UK. Then he started doing things for charity, like a 20km walk, and then he saw people running on TV and decided to do a marathon,” explained his British coach Harmander Singh, who met him in November 1999. Harmander trained him in just 11 weeks to run his first marathon, the London Marathon, in 2000, aged 89. Fauja Singh did nine marathons in total, his last one aged 101 in 2012 in London, which he completed in seven hours, 49 minutes.“He raised the profiles of charities and he always said it was the blessings of the beneficiaries of those charities that kept him going,” Harmander said. Fauja Singh liked his celebrity status as he got lots of attention, which kept him going, as many elderly people feel neglected.“He enjoyed the free socialising that came with his status and when he was invited by the former president of Pakistan, Pervez Musharraf, to run the Lahore Marathon, he couldn’t believe that a poor illiterate farmer who had never gone to school was rubbing shoulders with a head of state,” Harmander said. Fauja Singh walked or jogged for 10 miles a day and ate a minimal diet, and was very light in weight. “Some medical students did bone density tests on him and found his left leg had the bone density of a 30-year-old and his right leg had one of a 20-year-old, and his response was, ‘I always knew my left leg was weak’,” Harmander added.His running group “Sikhs In The City”, is raising money for a clubhouse for the route he used to run along which will be named after him. The group is also appealing for anyone whose life he touched to send messages for a memorial book.","Fauja Singh discovered running in his 80s as a means of remaining active and lifting boredom as he became older.

The catalogue entry refers to signs of restoration to tears in several places.Leighton met Gandhi when he visited London in 1931 to attend the Second Round Table Conference.At the time, Leighton was in a relationship with political journalist Henry Noel Brailsford, who was a passionate supporter of Indian Independence. It was through this connection that she was introduced to Gandhi and was one of the few artists admitted to Gandhi’s office to sit with him to sketch and paint him.In November 1931, Leighton showcased her portraits in an exhibition at the Albany Galleries in London.Journalist Winifred Holtby attended the opening and wrote: “The little man squats bare-headed, in his blanket, one finger raised, as it often is to emphasise a point, his lips parted for a word that is almost a smile… the statesman who knows just how to play on the psychology of friends and enemies alike.”","“Portrait of Mahatma Gandhi’ by British artist Clare Leighton sold for triple its estimate of £50,000-£70,000 (Rs 57 lakh to Rs 80 lakh) It was the top lot in the Travel and Exploration online sale and the first time this portrait has been sold at auction.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122542027,imgsize-22548,width-400,resizemode-4/122542027.jpg"
'Drunken stupidity': Two men jailed for destroying iconic Sycamore Gap tree in UK; incident caught on camera,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/drunken-stupidity-two-men-jailed-for-destroying-iconic-sycamore-gap-tree-in-uk-incident-caught-on-camera/articleshow/122517224.cms,"Representative Image





Two people were sentenced for over four years on Tuesday for destroying Britain's iconic 'Sycamore Gap' tree, a beloved global landmark recognised for its striking silhouette that appeared in a Hollywood film.The nearly 200-year-old sycamore stood magnificently in a distinctive dip alongside the historic Hadrian's Wall in northern England, serving as a favoured location for photographers, walkers and romantic proposals.Daniel Graham, 39, and Adam Carruthers, 32, were convicted last month for deliberately felling the tree with a chainsaw after travelling from their residences during the night in September 2023.They recorded their destructive act on Graham's mobile phone and subsequently boasted about it. Their friendship later deteriorated as public outrage intensified over their actions.Initially, both denied involvement in destroying the tree, which appeared in the 1991 film ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"" and caused damage to Hadrian's Wall, a UNESCO World Heritage Site constructed by Romans approximately 2,000 years ago.Their lawyers indicated that both men later acknowledged responsibility when speaking with probation officers. Carruthers' legal representative, Andrew Gurney, characterised the incident as ""drunken stupidity"".Judge Christina Lambert, while imposing four-year-and-three-month sentences, stated the men had felled the tree out of ""sheer bravado"".The National Trust, which manages the heritage site, reported in August signs of growth at the tree's base, suggesting potential regeneration.Recently, Northumberland National Park announced plans to display the largest section of the tree in an installation near its original location.","Daniel Graham, 39, and Adam Carruthers, 32, were convicted last month for deliberately felling the tree with a chainsaw.

Four members accused of stealing over 1 million pounds worth of jewellery from London’s Indian and South Asian communities were jailed Friday after they pleaded guilty to burglary.Jerry O’Donnell, Barney Maloney, Quey Adger and Patrick Ward, part of an organised crime network, have been sentenced for a total 17 years and one month after the Metropolitan Police led out a “comprehensive operation” against them.Head of investigation Met Police detective sergeant Lee Davison, said the gang “largely targeted the South Asian community throughout the capital,” as quoted by PTI.“This comprehensive operation enabled us to disrupt a key part of an organised crime network. As a result of the work conducted by specialist officers, a handful of serial criminals will now spend a substantial amount of time behind bars,” he added.Three of the men- O’Donnell, Maloney and Adger- were caught in July 2024 with stolen jewellery following a year-long intelligence-led investigation.Officers stopped their car after CCTV linked it to several burglaries. Inside, police found hundreds of stolen items, including a gold wedding ring, necklaces, and a solid gold hair pin.Each received sentences of over five years.Ward was arrested later at his home and identified as a key member of the same network. He was sentenced to two years and five months.As part of the investigation, officers also searched a Hatton Garden jewellery shop believed to be used for melting down stolen gold. They recovered 50,000 pounds in cash and eight kilos of jewellery, including a World War One officer’s Rolex, a gold locket with old photos, an engraved gold ring, and a gold pocket watch from Harlow Bros Ltd.Police said that dozens of people came forward after a public appeal in March, and many of the most recognisable items have been returned to their owners. However, officers are still working to trace the owners of the remaining stolen jewellery.The burglaries took place between December 2023 and July 2024 across south London areas such as Croydon, Sutton, and Wandsworth, and in counties including Surrey, Sussex, and Essex.","Jerry O’Donnell, Barney Maloney, Quey Adger and Patrick Ward, part of an organised crime network, have been sentenced for a total 17 years and one month.

Jury shown CCTV footage of two brothers assaulting police officers at Manchester Airport





A police officer has told a jury that she was left “absolutely terrified” after she was punched during a brawl with two men at the Manchester Airport last year. PC Lydia Ward from Greater Manchester was left with a broken nose in the incident that took place on July 23 last year at the Terminal 2 car park pay station, as reported by the BBC.She was allegedly attacked by Mohammed Fahir Amaaz, 20, and his brother Muhammad Amaad, 26. Both men are from Rochdale, Greater Manchester, and have denied the allegations.The jury heard that Amaaz was approached at a ticket machine by the female cop and two of her colleagues after they received a complaint that a man who fit his description had head-butted a customer at a Starbucks in the airport.Amaaz apparently resisted, and his brother then intervened. ""I was trying to keep hold of Mr Amaaz's arm and get it behind his back so I could get some cuffs on him,” said Ward. One of her colleagues was then pushed, and Amaaz started to kick him, said Ward.""I tried to grab him off so he could stop kicking PC Marsden. All I remember then is that he turned and he punched me straight in the face,” she said as reported by the BBC. ""I can't really remember where it landed but I know where my injuries were.I remember falling on the floor and everything went black.""""I was terrified to be honest. I was absolutely terrified. I had never experienced that level of violence towards me in my life,” she added. ""I didn't know who was going to come up at me next. I was scared of going after this male again and being punched in the face again.""Ward said people around them did not come up to help, and were “filming on their mobile phones"", ""Nobody came to assist. I felt everyone in that room was against us. To be honest, I was terrified,” she said.Footage from the bodycam that was presented in the court showed Ward was being comforted by one of her colleagues.Rosemary Fernandes, the lawyer representing Amaaz, suggested that her client was “taken by surprise” and was “shocked”. She also stressed that Amaaz had acted out in “lawful self-defence.” ""It is important you identify yourselves as police officers, isn't it?"" she asked.Ward said that they did not have the time for any “rational discussion” as the situation turned “violent quickly"". ""He could see I was a police officer and he could see I was a female as well,” she added.Amaaz was accused of assaulting PC Marsden and PC Ward, resulting in actual bodily harm, and also accused of assaulting PC Cook and Abdulkareem Ismaeil from Starbucks.His brother was accused of having assaulted PC Marsden, resulting in actual bodily harm. Both men have denied these allegations while the trial is going on.","PC Lydia Ward from Greater Manchester was left with a broken nose.

The cumulative effect

“Hide your strength and bide your time,” Deng Xiaoping, the transformative Chinese premier, once advised – a maxim that became shorthand for China’s post-Cold War foreign policy. It urged patience, strategic restraint and the quiet accumulation of national power, while avoiding confrontations that could derail domestic development. The idea —— shaped Beijing’s external posture for decades.For decades, Beijing followed that script closely.Under President Xi Jinping , that restraint has eroded. China today operates with a dual posture: overt where it can, ambiguous where it must. The shift is visible not only in rhetoric but in a pattern of calibrated actions – military, economic, legal and technological – that collectively alter realities on the ground without triggering open conflict.The change is not always announced through declarations or formal doctrine. Instead, it is visible in actions that appear isolated when viewed individually, but form a coherent strategy when taken together.This strategy operates in what analysts call the “gray zone”: the space between peace and war, where states pursue coercive objectives without crossing thresholds that would trigger direct military retaliation. And at the heart of China’s gray zone behaviour lies a method that strategists have come to describe as salami slicing.Do we not have checks and balances? Maybe international rules based order?International law, on paper, has been unambiguous. Yet Beijing’s response to adverse rulings has been equally consistent. When the International Court of Justice under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) ruled in July 2016 that China’s sweeping claims in the South China Sea had no legal basis, Beijing dismissed the verdict as “null and void” and “devoid of any binding force” and continued its activities unabated. The episode stressed again on a recurring dilemma for the international system: rules exist, but enforcement against a determined major power remains elusive.This tension – between legal clarity and strategic ambiguity – lies at the heart of China’s covert strategy.Salami slicing is not a Chinese term, or a formal doctrine codified in military manuals, nor is it confined to military affairs. The concept originated in Cold War Europe, where it described how political power could be consolidated gradually – slice by slice – without provoking decisive resistance.It refers to the pursuit of strategic objectives through a series of small, calibrated steps, each designed to fall below the threshold that would trigger military retaliation or unified international response. No single move is decisive, but together they transform the strategic landscape.According to the US National Intelligence Council, gray zone activities involve “coercive or subversive actions to achieve objectives at the expense of others in contravention of, or in the absence of, international norms,” while remaining below the threshold of armed conflict – a definition cited by the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission.Applied to China, salami slicing thrives on ambiguity. It exploits the hesitation of rivals, the slow machinery of international law, and the difficulty of mobilising collective responses to actions that appear non-violent, technical or civilian in nature. Over time, it creates new facts on the ground – or on the water – that become difficult to reverse.China’s gray zone activities span military, economic, cyber, legal, informational and space domains, and are deliberately structured to exploit:Nowhere has this approach been more systematically applied than in the South China Sea – but it does not end there.The South China Sea is not merely a regional waterway. It is one of the world’s most economically and strategically consequential maritime corridors, linking Northeast Asia with the Indian Ocean and Europe and carrying energy supplies, manufactured goods and raw materials essential to the global economy.According to the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), roughly one-third of global maritime trade passes through the South China Sea every year. China’s dependence on this maritime corridor is particularly high.CSIS data shows that in 2016, more than 64% of China’s maritime trade – valued at approximately $874 billion – transited these waters. Control over the sea, therefore, carries consequences far beyond geography; it shapes economic security, supply chains and strategic leverage, a reality that underpins Beijing’s long-term approach.It is against this backdrop that China’s expansive maritime claims must be understood.China claims “historic rights” over most of the South China Sea based on a map first published in 1947, marked by a series of dashes enclosing nearly the entire basin. This so-called nine-dash line overlaps with the exclusive economic zones (EEZs) of several Southeast Asian states, including the Philippines and Vietnam.Under the UNCLOS, coastal states are entitled to EEZs extending up to 200 nautical miles from their shores, granting them rights over resources such as fisheries and hydrocarbons. Many Southeast Asian economies rely heavily on access to these zones.China’s claims cut across this legal framework – but instead of enforcing them through direct military confrontation, Beijing has pursued control through incremental occupation and sustained presence.Rather than enforcing its position through direct confrontation, China has pursued control incrementally. The process that began in the 1970s with the seizure of the Paracel Islands, follows till today.The strategy became unmistakable in 2012, during a standoff at Scarborough Shoal, a small but strategically located reef just 120 nautical miles west of the Philippine island of Luzon.The confrontation began when Philippine authorities attempted to arrest Chinese fishermen operating within Manila’s EEZ. What followed was not a naval battle, but a prolonged game of manoeuvre. Chinese coast guard vessels, naval units and maritime militia ships blocked access to the shoal, eventually establishing de facto control.There was no formal declaration, no transfer ceremony, no shots fired. Philippine vessels withdrew. Chinese ships stayed.Multiple analysts have widely cited Scarborough Shoal as a textbook example of salami slicing: a gradual, attritional takeover that altered the status quo without triggering a military response.Scarborough was not an isolated case. It was part of a longer trajectory.China began asserting control over features in the South China Sea as early as the 1970s, when it took the Paracel Islands from Vietnam. In 1995, it occupied Mischief Reef, a submerged feature claimed by the Philippines and Vietnam. In 2012, Scarborough followed.According to the Wall Street Journal, from 2013 to 2016, Beijing escalated its approach by undertaking a massive land-reclamation programme across the Spratly Islands. Submerged reefs such as Mischief Reef and Subi Reef were transformed into artificial islands capable of hosting airstrips, deep-water ports, radar installations and military garrisons.In September 2015, President Xi Jinping stated publicly that “We are committed to maintaining peace and stability in the South China Sea, and China does not intend to pursue militarization” of the South China Sea.US officials later said satellite imagery showed the deployment of missile systems, aircraft hangars, jamming equipment and advanced sensors on several of these features, contradicting that assurance, reported WSJ.By the mid-2010s, China had established 27 outposts across disputed areas – 20 in the Paracels and seven in the Spratlys – significantly expanding its ability to project power and monitor activity across the sea.The Philippines sought to challenge China’s actions through legal means. In July 2016, the International Court of Justice under UNCLOS ruled overwhelmingly in Manila’s favour.The tribunal found that China’s historic rights claims under the nine-dash line had no legal basis, and that several features occupied by China lay within the Philippines’ EEZ and could not generate maritime entitlements of their own.China rejected the ruling outright, calling it “null and void” and refusing to participate in the proceedings. It did not vacate any occupied features, nor did it scale back its activities.The episode exposed a structural weakness in the international rules-based order: international courts can clarify law, but they lack enforcement mechanisms when major powers choose non-compliance. Scarborough Shoal remains under Chinese control. The facts on the water did not change.Since the ruling, China has only intensified gray zone maritime pressure rather than reducing it.According to the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission, Chinese coast guard and affiliated vessels over the years even in 2025 repeatedly harassed Philippine operations near contested features such as Second Thomas Shoal, where a small contingent of Filipino personnel remains stationed on a grounded naval vessel.These encounters have involved water cannons, deliberate blocking manoeuvres and collisions. At least one Filipino sailor was seriously injured during such clashes, according to a CNN report.Analysts say the objective is not immediate eviction, but gradual exhaustion – making continued presence increasingly costly and risky without provoking outright conflict. Helena Legarda, a maritime analyst, has described the approach as one that seeks to “make occupancy untenable over time.”China’s maritime posture increasingly relies on a layered force structure that blurs civilian and military roles.A key element of China’s strategy is the use of the country's maritime militia – ostensibly civilian fishing fleets organised and directed by state authorities – routinely shadow foreign vessels, block access to contested features and engage in aggressive manoeuvres.Operating alongside the coast guard and navy, these vessels intimidate foreign fishermen, shadow naval patrols and assert presence in disputed waters. Their civilian appearance complicates response options for rival states, which risk escalation if they use force.This blending of civilian and military roles allows China to apply pressure while maintaining plausible deniability – a hallmark of gray zone operations.At the Second Thomas Shoal, Chinese coast guard vessels have repeatedly obstructed resupply missions to a grounded Philippine naval ship used to assert sovereignty.This approach reflects what Chinese strategists have termed “cabbage tactics” – surrounding contested features with multiple layers of vessels to isolate them gradually.While the South China Sea offers the clearest illustration, salami slicing is not confined to maritime disputes.The US Commission documents a broad pattern of gray zone activities across domains:The People’s Liberation Army Air Force conducted thousands of incursions into Taiwan’s air defence identification zone (ADIZ) in 2024, averaging nearly three per day – a sustained pressure campaign short of invasion.Chinese coast guard vessels spent a record number of days operating near disputed islands administered by Japan, regularly entering territorial waters.Taiwan’s National Security Bureau reported an average of 2.4 million cyberattacks per day against government networks in 2024, attributing most to China’s cyber forces. US officials have warned that Chinese advanced persistent threat groups have infiltrated critical infrastructure networks to pre-position for potential disruptions.Beijing has timed trade investigations and regulatory actions around political events, restricted exports of critical minerals since late 2023, and selectively removed tariffs to reward diplomatic alignment – using market access as leverage.China has expanded the authority of its coast guard to detain vessels and personnel in waters it claims, providing a domestic legal veneer to contested actions. It has also launched antimonopoly investigations into foreign firms amid broader trade disputes.In 2024 and 2025, China conducted a series of proximity operations in space, demonstrating capabilities to interfere with or disable other satellites. A Chinese satellite firm with reported links to the PLA allegedly provided imagery to non-state actors involved in Red Sea attacks, according to US officials.One of the least visible — yet most consequential — arenas of gray zone competition lies beneath the ocean surface.Undersea cables carry an estimated 95% of global internet traffic, underpinning financial transactions, military communications and government services. According to the US-China Review Commission, Chinese research institutions affiliated with the PLA have studied cable-cutting techniques for more than a decade, securing patents for deep-sea severing technologies.In February 2025, Chinese scientists linked to the China Ship Scientific Research Center unveiled a design for an electric cutting device capable of severing armoured cables at depths exceeding 13,000 feet.Since 2023, multiple incidents involving Chinese-owned vessels have damaged undersea cables near Taiwan and in the Baltic Sea.In November 2024, a Chinese vessel dragged its anchor for more than 100 miles, severing cables connecting Sweden-Lithuania and Germany-Finland. European investigators later indicated suspected coordination with Russian intelligence.China has also delayed repairs by requiring permits for cable repair ships operating in waters it claims, prolonging outages and creating economic disruption. US officials have warned that Chinese repair vessels could also be used for espionage, exploiting a shortage of alternative repair capacity in the Asia-Pacific.Taken together, these activities demonstrate not only capability development but operational rehearsal for future contingencies.Beyond territory, China has pursued incremental influence through infrastructure finance, technology standards and institutional positioning.Building on the Belt and Road Initiative, Beijing’s Global Security Initiative has expanded security cooperation with low- and middle-income countries, frequently offering surveillance and policing systems supplied by firms such as Huawei.According to US assessments, these systems are often embedded in critical infrastructure, raising concerns about data access and service disruption during geopolitical crises.China has also sought greater representation in international standard-setting bodies, shaping technical norms in ways that favour its industrial and governance models. These moves rarely provoke immediate opposition but, over time, alter decision-making terrain.Each individual action – a patrol, a regulation, a cyber intrusion, a reef turned island – may appear manageable in isolation. None of these actions alone constitutes war. None demands immediate escalation. That is precisely the point. The strategic impact emerges only in aggregation.This is the essence of salami slicing: incremental steps that avoid red lines, exploit hesitation, and create new facts on the ground. By the time responses coalesce, the baseline has shifted.As the 2016 UNCLOS ruling demonstrated, law can clarify rights, but it cannot by itself reverse realities established through years of calibrated action.China’s gray zone strategy operates on that premise – that influence can be accumulated without war, and that patience, once urged by Deng Xiaoping, can be replaced by persistence under ambiguity.For the international system, the challenge remains unresolved: how to respond to change that is slow, deliberate and legally contested – but strategically decisive.","China operates with a dual posture: overt where it can, ambiguous where it must.

After years of detention and a death sentence, he resurfaced seeking the presidency, a bid that ultimately failed.

Symbolic weight, contested legacy





Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, once viewed as the Western-friendly face of Libya and heir apparent to longtime ruler Muammar Gaddafi, was killed in a “direct confrontation” after gunmen broke into his home, his office said on Tuesday. No further details of the incident were disclosed.Despite holding no official government post, Saif al-Islam was for years considered one of the most powerful figures in Libya, shaping policy and serving as a key interlocutor with Western governments during his father’s four-decade rule.Educated at the London School of Economics and fluent in English, Saif al-Islam cultivated close ties with Western capitals and was widely seen as a reformist figure within the Libyan system.He played a central role in Libya’s decision to abandon its weapons of mass destruction programme and negotiated compensation for families of victims of the 1988 Pan Am Flight 103 bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland.He frequently called for a constitution, political reform and respect for human rights, positioning himself as the figure who could reintegrate Libya into the international community after years of sanctions and isolation.That image collapsed when the 2011 uprising against Muammar Gaddafi erupted. Saif al-Islam publicly sided with his father and became one of the architects of the regime’s violent response to the revolt, referring to rebels as “rats”.“We fight here in Libya, we die here in Libya,” he told Reuters at the time. He warned that “rivers of blood” would flow and said the government would fight “to the last man and woman and bullet”.In a televised address, he cautioned: “All of Libya will be destroyed. We will need 40 years to reach an agreement on how to run the country, because today, everyone will want to be president, or emir, and everybody will want to run the country.”After Tripoli fell to rebels, Saif al-Islam attempted to flee to neighbouring Niger disguised as a Bedouin tribesman. He was captured by the Abu Bakr al-Sadiq Brigade militia and taken to the western town of Zintan, about a month after his father was killed by rebels.“I’m staying here. They’ll empty their guns into me the second I go out there,” he said in comments captured on an audio recording during his capture, according to Reuters.He spent about six years in detention in Zintan. Human Rights Watch said he did not allege physical abuse, though concerns were raised over prolonged solitary confinement. He said he was isolated and did not receive visitors, though he had access to television and books.In 2015, a Tripoli court sentenced him to death by firing squad for war crimes. The International Criminal Court also issued an arrest warrant against him for “murder and persecution”.Released in 2017 under an amnesty law, Saif al-Islam remained largely underground for years to avoid assassination, according to Libyan analyst Mustafa Fetouri. From 2016, he was allowed limited contact with people inside and outside Libya.In 2021, wearing traditional Libyan attire, he resurfaced publicly to file his candidacy for Libya’s planned presidential elections, seeking to draw on nostalgia for stability under his father’s rule.His candidacy proved deeply divisive. He was disqualified due to his conviction, and efforts to appeal were blocked by armed groups. The dispute became a major factor in the collapse of the election process and Libya’s return to political stalemate.“I’ve been away from the Libyan people for 10 years,” he told The New York Times Magazine in 2021. “You need to come back slowly, slowly. Like a striptease. You need to play with their minds a little.”Analysts say Saif al-Islam retained symbolic importance despite limited public engagement.“After Saif al-Islam was freed a few years ago, he proved incapable of delivering speeches or producing public statements through the press or social media,” Jalel Harchaoui of the Royal United Services Institute told Reuters. “Yet his symbolic significance remained substantial.”“Now that he has been slain, most pro-Gaddafi factions will experience both diminished morale and anger,” Harchaoui said, adding that one major obstacle to holding elections in Libya had been removed.","Saif al-Islam Gaddafi was killed in a ‘direct confrontation’ after gunmen broke into his home.

Pakistan has been invited to participate in upcoming talks between Iran and the United States aimed at easing tensions between the two countries, slated to take place on Friday in Turkey.“Pakistan has received the invitation for the upcoming talks between Iran and the United States,” Pakistan foreign office spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said while responding to a query, reported Dawn.Pakistan's deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar is expected to take part in the meeting, the daily reported citing a diplomatic source, adding that “Islamabad’s participation was seen as significant.”An Arab official told AFP on condition of anonymity that the meeting is likely to be held in Turkiye on Friday. The format of the talks remains unclear, though the official said the main meeting would take place that day.A regional official told Reuters that the priority of the talks was to avoid conflict and de-escalate tensions between Iran and the US, adding that several regional powers had been invited at the foreign ministers’ level.According to the official, countries invited include Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Egypt, Oman and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).US outlet Axios, citing two sources and a US official, reported that Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi was expected to meet US envoy Steve Witkoff in Istanbul to discuss a possible agreement related to Iran’s nuclear programme.Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian confirmed on Tuesday that he had instructed Araghchi to pursue “fair and equitable negotiations” in an environment “free from threats and unreasonable expectations”.The talks, he said in posts on X, would be held “within the framework of our national interests”.US President Donald Trump has said he is hopeful Washington would “work something out” with Iran but warned on Monday that “bad things would happen” if no deal was reached.In an interview with CNN on Sunday, Araghchi said: “President Trump said no nuclear weapons, and we fully agree. We fully agree with that. That could be a very good deal.”“In return, we expect sanctions to be lifted,” he added, while warning that Iran was prepared for war if talks failed, saying any conflict would likely spread beyond Iran.Turkiye has been leading diplomatic efforts to defuse tensions, with Araghchi visiting Istanbul last week and engaging with regional counterparts, including in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan.Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia and the UAE have assured Tehran that they would not allow their airspace or territory to be used for military action against Iran, while Jordan has said it would not act as a “launching pad” for any such action.","Pakistan has been invited to participate in upcoming talks between Iran and the United States.

"US-Russia nuclear treaty nears expiry, Kremlin warns of 'dangerous' moment: Why New START matters for global security",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/defence/international/us-russia-nuclear-treaty-nears-expiry-kremlin-warns-of-dangerous-moment-why-new-start-matters-for-global-security/articleshow/127897834.cms,"Putin Aide Medvedev Shoots APOCALYPSE Warning As Last US-Russia Nuclear Treaty Nears Expiry | Watch

What is the US-Russia nuclear treaty and why it matters



The Kremlin on Tuesday warned that the world was heading into a “dangerous” phase as the last remaining nuclear arms control treaty between the United States and Russia is set to expire this week, potentially leaving the two largest nuclear powers without any formal limits on their arsenals.The treaty, known as New START, is due to expire on Thursday. It is the final surviving agreement from a series of Cold War-era arms control deals that once governed nuclear competition between Washington and Moscow.“In just a few days, the world will be in a more dangerous position than it has ever been before,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists, including AFP, during a daily briefing.The Kremlin said it had proposed a one-year extension of the treaty but had received no formal response from Washington. “We still haven't received a response from the Americans to this initiative,” Peskov said.If the treaty lapses without replacement or extension, the United States and Russia would, for the first time in decades, be without any binding framework to limit or verify their strategic nuclear weapons. Moscow warned this would remove the only remaining mechanism to control the world’s two largest nuclear arsenals.US President Donald Trump, who oversaw the withdrawal of the United States from several international agreements, said in September that extending New START “sounds like a good idea,” but no concrete steps have followed.The treaty was signed in 2010 by then Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and US President Barack Obama, and came into force the following year. It included provisions for on-site inspections and data exchanges to ensure compliance.However, Russia suspended inspections during the COVID-19 pandemic, and broader talks on extending or replacing the treaty stalled as relations deteriorated following the war in Ukraine. Moscow has accused Washington of obstructing inspection missions on US territory.In 2023, Russia announced it was freezing its participation in New START, although it said it would continue to voluntarily adhere to the numerical limits set by the treaty.The warning comes amid rising military signalling on both sides. Moscow last year tested new nuclear-capable delivery systems without warheads, while Trump said he had ordered two US nuclear submarines to move closer to Russia.New START is the last remaining nuclear arms control treaty between the United States and Russia and is widely seen as a cornerstone of global strategic stability.Under the agreement, both countries are limited to 1,550 deployed strategic nuclear warheads each. The treaty also caps deployed intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles and heavy bombers at 700, with an additional limit of 800 launchers. These weapons are designed to strike an adversary’s key political, military and industrial targets in the event of a nuclear conflict.A central feature of New START is its verification regime, which allows for on-site inspections, notifications and data sharing to reduce the risk of miscalculation. While inspections have been halted since the pandemic and Russia’s suspension of participation, neither side has formally accused the other of breaching the warhead limits.The treaty was extended once in 2021, shortly after Trump’s successor took office, as the agreement allows only a single extension. With that option exhausted, any further continuation would require a new deal or informal political understanding.Analysts warn that the expiry of New START would end more than five decades of formal nuclear arms control between Washington and Moscow. Previous agreements, including the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty and the Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty, have already collapsed.Without a replacement framework, both sides would be free to expand their nuclear arsenals, though experts say large-scale increases would take time due to technical and logistical constraints. Over the longer term, the absence of limits and transparency could fuel a renewed arms race driven by worst-case assumptions.Efforts to negotiate a successor treaty face major hurdles. Trump has said he wants a broader agreement that includes China, an idea Beijing has rejected, arguing its arsenal is far smaller. Russia has countered that the nuclear forces of Britain and France should also be included, a proposal those countries oppose.With New START nearing expiration and no clear diplomatic breakthrough in sight, the future of US-Russia nuclear arms control remains uncertain, raising concerns about rising nuclear risks at a time of heightened global tensions.",New START is the last remaining nuclear arms control treaty between the United States and Russia.

A former nurse has pleaded guilty to fraud and drug possession after admitting to defrauding a Quebec medical clinic of more than $55,000 to obtain opioid medications.Lovedip Sandhu, a 35-year-old Canadian national and resident of Pierrefonds, entered her guilty plea in mid-January to charges of fraud over $5,000 and simple possession of narcotics. The offences stem from her work at a private plastic surgery clinic in Montreal in 2021, reports French-Canadian newspaper La Presse.Sandhu was employed at Clinique K, a plastic surgery clinic in Westmount, where she worked as a nursing assistant. Her duties included preparing patients for surgery, organising medication orders, and dealing with pharmaceutical companies on behalf of the clinic.Between March and September 2021, prosecutors say Sandhu carried out 75 fraudulent transactions without her employer’s knowledge. She forged the signature of the clinic’s owner, Dr Karl Schwarz, to place orders for opiates. She later collected the drugs from pharmacies and paid for them using the clinic’s credit cards.Through the scheme, Sandhu obtained 3,778 one-millilitre vials of sufentanil and 2,138 one-millilitre vials of hydromorphone.At the time of the offences, Sandhu was a registered member of the Quebec Order of Nurses and Nursing Assistants.She is no longer part of the professional body, having been expelled in 2022.Following her arrest in September 2021, Sandhu told police she had developed an addiction earlier that year due to health issues. She admitted initially taking medication from the clinic’s supply before her use increased.Police searches uncovered empty syringes and vials, several boxes of medication, and $11,000 in cash at her homes. Sentencing submissions in the case have been postponed until June.","Lovedip Sandhu, a 35-year-old Canadian national, entered her guilty plea in mid- January to charges of fraud over $5,000 and simple possession of narcotics.

Several other artists, including Bad Bunny and Kehlani, also used their acceptance speeches to address immigration enforcement and to highlight immigrant contributions in US and their rights.

Billie’s comments follow a long confrontation with the Trump administration after federal agents shot and killed two U.S. citizens last month. Nurse Alex Pretti and mother Renée Good were fatally shot during a federal crackdown in Minnesota. Eilish had publicly referenced the Pretti and Good shootings in social media posts before the Grammys.

US President Donald Trump and other MAGA leaders slammed the Grammys for their opposition to government policies, especially regarding ICE. Nicki Minaj, who has been leaning toward the Republican side lately, was also mocked by host Trevor Noah at the award show.

A Brazilian influencer who publicly supported US President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown has been detained by US immigration authorities, despite previously insisting that only criminals were targeted for deportation.Júnior Pena, whose full name is Eustáquio da Silva Pena Júnior, was taken into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on Saturday in New Jersey, according to Brazilian outlet Brazilian Times. Pena is known for his pro-Trump views and for posting videos about life in the United States as an immigrant.A source told the outlet that Pena’s detention was due to an administrative issue involving an immigration hearing. The hearing had reportedly been postponed, but the change was not properly recorded in the system, leading authorities to mark Pena as absent when he did not attend.Pena has a large online following, with around 1.3 million followers on TikTok and nearly 500,000 on Instagram. On his platforms, he often described the “reality of the USA” and openly voiced support for Trump.After Trump assumed office for his second term, the president promised an immigration crackdown that focused heavily on Latin American immigrants in its first six months.During that period, Pena told his Brazilian audience that those being targeted were criminals.“I wanted to tell you not to be so scared, there are many people scared. There are many influencers spreading fear among immigrants without having facts, evidence, or proof that so-and-so was deported,” Pena said in one video. He also claimed that those detained were “crooks.”The crackdown has led to the deaths of two American citizens named Renee Good and Alex Pretti in Minneapolis and triggered protests against ICE across several states.According to a December report citing Brazil’s Federal Police, 2,268 Brazilian nationals were deported from the United States in 2025, the highest number recorded since data collection began in 2020.Pena came to the US in 2009 and is currently being held at Delaney Hall Detention Center in Newark while his lawyer, Andrew Lattarulo, works to block his transfer to another state.His detention has sparked strong reactions online, with social media accusing him of “self-sabotage” and warning that he promoted an unrealistic version of the American dream. A GoFundMe campaign was launched to cover legal and court costs, reaching its $32,000 goal by Monday.","Júnior Pena was taken into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on Saturday in New Jersey.

Nancy Guthrie, the 84‑year‑old mother of Savannah Guthrie, co‑anchor of NBC’s Today show, was reported missing from her home near Tucson, Arizona, and authorities are now treating the case as a possible crime, law enforcement officials said.Nancy was last seen at her home in the Catalina Foothills area north of Tucson on the evening of Saturday, January 31, according to the Pima County Sheriff’s Department. Her family reported her missing to police around noon on Sunday, February 1, after she failed to arrive at church and could not be reached.Sheriff Chris Nanos said there were concerning signs at the residence, and law enforcement has officially declared the home a crime scene. Officials said there is reason to believe Guthrie did not leave her house on her own.“Nancy Guthrie is of great sound mind,” a sheriff’s official said, noting that the 84‑year‑old has no known cognitive issues. However, she has physical limitations and requires daily medication, which could be life‑threatening if she goes without it for too long.Nancy is described by authorities as about 5 feet 5 inches tall, weighing around 150 pounds, with brown hair and blue eyes.She lives alone at her residence near East Skyline Drive and North Campbell Avenue in Tucson.Law enforcement has launched a wide search effort, including volunteers, drones, helicopters and search dogs, but as of Monday Nancy had not been located. Sheriff Nanos said homicide detectives have been called in because of the unusual conditions found at her home.Savannah Guthrie was absent from the Today show on Monday as the search continued. In a statement read by colleagues on the broadcast, she thanked law enforcement and members of the public for their support and asked anyone with information to contact the Pima County Sheriff’s Department. Officials have asked neighbours to check home security footage and report anything unusual.No further details about Nancy’s disappearance have been released, and investigators have not identified any suspects.","Nancy Guthrie, 84, was reported missing from her home near Tucson, Arizona.

US President Donald Trump lashed out at a female reporter during a tense Oval Office exchange, snapping “You are the worst reporter” and telling her, “I don't think I've ever seen you smile,” after she pressed him about the latest Jeffrey Epstein document release.The confrontation unfolded when CNN’s Kaitlan Collins raised concerns about how the US Justice Department handled files linked to the convicted sex offender. She noted that “a lot of women who are survivors of Epstein are unhappy with” the redactions, adding that “entire witness interviews are totally blacked out.” Collins then asked what he would say to survivors who feel they have not received justice.Trump tried to shut down the line of questioning, replying: “I think it’s really time for the country to get on to something else, now that nothing came out about me”. He went further, saying, “Nothing came out about me other than it was a conspiracy against me, literally, by Epstein and other people. But I think it's time now for the country to maybe get on to something else like health care or something that people care about. ”As Collins continued, Trump lashed out. “You are the worst reporter. CNN has no ratings because of people like you. I don't think I've ever seen you smile. For 10 years I've never seen a smile on your face.You know why you're not smiling? Because you know you're not telling the truth.” He added: “You are so bad. You know, you are the worst reporter. No wonder. CNN has no ratings because of people like you.”CNN later described Collins as “an exceptional journalist” who reports “with real depth and tenacity”. As reporters were ushered out of the Oval Office, Trump was heard repeating that “she never smiles” while gesturing towards the press.The clash came as the political and legal fallout from the Epstein document releases continued on both sides of the Atlantic. In the United States, prominent figures including Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton are due to testify before Congress. Neither Trump nor the Clintons have been accused of criminal wrongdoing connected to Epstein.In the UK, former British ambassador to Washington Peter Mandelson resigned from the House of Lords amid controversy over his past links to Epstein, and British police said they were examining possible “misconduct in public office offenses”. The latest files have also revived scrutiny around Prince Andrew and others previously associated with the disgraced financier.","CNN’s Kaitlan Collins raised concerns about how the US Justice Department handled files linked to the convicted sex offender.

US F-35C downs Iranian Shahed-139 drone

Second maritime incident reported

Iran signals shift toward negotiations

White House confirms planned talks

Turkey and regional states involved

Nuclear issue remains central





The US military shot down an Iranian drone near an American aircraft carrier early Tuesday, heightening tensions between Washington and Tehran just as both sides were preparing for possible diplomatic talks later this week.US Central Command said the drone “aggressively approached” a US Navy aircraft carrier just before sunrise Tuesday with “unclear intent.”The incident unfolded hours after Iran’s president signaled a willingness to negotiate with the United States.The drone continued flying toward the ship despite “deescalatory measures taken by US forces operating in international waters,” Central Command spokesman Capt. Tim Hawkins said.An F-35C fighter jet from the USS Abraham Lincoln shot down the Shahed-139 drone. The aircraft carrier was sailing about 500 miles (805 kilometers) from Iran’s southern coast at the time, Hawkins said.Later Tuesday, Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps forces harassed a merchant vessel flying the American flag and carrying an American crew, according to Central Command.Two boats and an Iranian Mohajer drone approached the Stena Imperative “at high speeds and threatened to board and seize the tanker,” Hawkins said.The British military’s United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center said the incident appeared to have occurred in Iranian territorial waters. Iran had warned in recent days that the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard would conduct naval drills.The US destroyer USS McFaul responded and escorted the Stena Imperative with defensive air support. Central Command said the vessel is now sailing safely.Earlier Tuesday, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said he instructed Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi to “pursue fair and equitable negotiations” with the United States.The statement marked a significant turn for Pezeshkian, a reformist who has warned for weeks that unrest in Iran had moved beyond his control. It also suggested backing from Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has previously dismissed talks with Washington.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed that US special envoy Steve Witkoff has been planning to hold talks with Iranian officials in Turkey later this week, marking the first direct acknowledgment by the White House.“These talks, as of right now, are still scheduled,” Leavitt said when asked whether the drone incident could affect the plans.“President Trump is always wanting to pursue diplomacy first, but obviously it takes two to tango,” she said. “You need a willing partner to achieve diplomacy and that’s something that special envoy Witkoff is intent on exploring and discussing.”Turkey has been working behind the scenes to facilitate the talks as Witkoff travels through the region. A Turkish official said the location of the talks remained uncertain but that Turkey was prepared to support the process.Foreign ministers from Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have also been invited to attend, according to an official who spoke on condition of anonymity.The prospects for an agreement remain unclear, particularly as US President Donald Trump has added Iran’s nuclear program to a list of demands.Trump ordered the bombing of three Iranian nuclear sites during the 12-day war Israel launched against Iran in June.“Right now, we’re talking to them, we’re talking to Iran, and if we could work something out, that’d be great,” Trump said Monday. “And if we can’t, probably bad things would happen.”","US Central Command said the drone “aggressively approached” a US Navy aircraft carrier.

Indian-origin taxi driver Gurmeet Singh to be stripped of US citizenship over rape; hid crime during naturalisation process,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/indian-origin-taxi-driver-gurmeet-singh-to-be-stripped-of-us-citizenship-over-rape-hid-crime-during-naturalisation-process/articleshow/127897402.cms,"



The US Department of Justice has announced that it is seeking to revoke the citizenship of Gurmeet Singh , an Indian-origin man who became a naturalised US citizen after hiding a previous conviction for rape.The DOJ said Singh lied about his criminal history when he applied for US citizenship. He had previously kidnapped and sexually assaulted a female passenger in his taxi.The incident occurred after the woman fell asleep in the backseat of his car. Singh allegedly drove her to a side street, where she awoke to find him on top of her, holding a knife to her throat. He reportedly warned her to stop resisting if she wanted to live, then bound, gagged, blindfolded, and raped her.Singh became a US citizen on October 19, 2011, after hiding these acts during his naturalisation process. He was later convicted in May 2014 in New York of first-degree rape and second-degree kidnapping as a sexually motivated felony and sentenced to 20 years in prison.Taking away citizenship or Denaturalisation can only happen through a federal court ruling. It is a complicated process and is used only when someone lied to get citizenship or committed serious crimes.People born in the US cannot lose their citizenship. Only naturalised citizens can.Moreover, the Trump administration has reportedly told United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) offices to send 100 to 200 cases a month to the Justice Department for 2026, like the Singh one. For comparison, only about 120 cases were filed across the country between 2017 and 2025. The process puts pressure on the courts, but it helps protect the value of US citizenship according to some Republicans.US Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a press release: “This Department of Justice will continue to strip citizenship from those who commit heinous crimes and conceal them during the naturalization process. American citizenship is a great and sacred privilege that must be earned honestly.”US Attorney Joseph Nocella Jr. also weighed in on Singh's case: “The defendant in this case secured U.S. citizenship through deceit, and on the heels of committing the heinous crimes of rape and kidnapping. This case, brought to strip the defendant of citizenship that he did not earn and to which he was not entitled, demonstrates our Office’s commitment to protecting the American people and defending the sanctity of U.S. citizenship.”Singh’s case will now be heard in federal court, where a judge will decide whether the government has met the legal standard required to revoke his citizenship.","Gurmeet Singh became a US citizen on October 19, 2011, after hiding these acts during his naturalisation process.

She was lying next to her nephew when she awoke to find Awad with a handgun tucked into his waistband, committing the assault. After freeing herself, the victim grabbed her nephew and told Awad she would not report the attack if he left.Following the incident, the victim contacted her sister, who alerted the authorities. A search led to Awad being apprehended by police in Louisville, Kentucky, on January 16, 2026. He was extradited to Tennessee the following week and charged with aggravated rape with a weapon, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, and aggravated burglary.Awad was admitted to the US via the Green Card Lottery system, according to the Department of Homeland Security.“Horrendous immigration policies allowed this monster into our country and made victims of children and families,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin.She added, “This child rapist was allowed into our country by the Diversity Lottery program. Secretary Noem paused the diversity lottery to ensure no more Americans are harmed by this disastrous program. ICE lodged an arrest detainer to ensure he is not released onto our streets to victimise more children.”Since entering the United States in 2017 under the Diversity Lottery programme, Awad has accumulated a long criminal record, including domestic violence, intimidation, possession of a weapon, violation of a court order, and vehicle theft.ICE has placed Awad in removal proceedings and lodged a detainer to prevent him from being released into US communities while legal action continues.","Mena Mohsen Farez Nmn Awad, an Egyptian national, was charged with raping a 16-year-old girl while she slept in her own bed in Nashville, Tennessee.

Pakistan-born Anosh Ahmed, a former executive at Loretto Hospital in Chicago, has been arrested in Serbia after fleeing the United States following charges of defrauding the federal government of $290 million.US prosecutors have confirmed that they intend to seek his extradition.Ahmed was taken into custody on November 30, 2025, following the issuance of a global alert, known as a Red Notice, which is an international request by Interpol to locate and arrest a person.Assistant US Attorneys Sheri Mecklenburg and Kelly Guzman confirmed that Ahmed is in custody in Serbia: “As of now, the United States understands that Ahmed remains in custody in Serbia, pending extradition.”A Serbian court denied Ahmed’s request to be released to a hotel in Belgrade on December 30 and ordered him to remain in custody.Ahmed resigned in March 2021 after controversies during the Covid-19 pandemic involving improper vaccination incidents. Loretto Hospital gave shots to people who were not yet eligible, including workers at Trump Tower and members of an Oak Forest church.According to reporting by Block Club Chicago, Ahmed came to US as a child from Pakistan.Court documents allege that he obtained personal information of around 150,000 patients at Loretto Hospital and used it to submit fraudulent claims to the federal government.Ahmed and two others, Heather Bergdahl and Sameer Suhail, were charged in 2024 with embezzling over $15 million from the hospital by submitting fake invoices and false payment requests.Last year, Ahmed and three others were accused of filing nearly $900 million in fake claims for Covid-19 testing materials, with about $293 million paid out. The other people charged are Mohamed Sirajudeen, Mahmood Sami Khan, and Suhaib Ahmad Chaudhry. Prosecutors say Sirajudeen is expected to plead guilty before theA hearing for the case is set for February 13, 2026. Prosecutors said that if Ahmed is not extradited, they will adjust the evidence for the defendants who are on trial.","Pakistan-born Anosh Ahmed, a former executive at Loretto Hospital in Chicago, has been arrested in Serbia after fleeing the United States.

Texas journalist 'exposes' Indian recruiters behind 'H-1B only' job ads on LinkedIn: 'When I call the numbers...',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/texas-journalist-exposes-indian-recruiters-behind-h-1b-only-job-ads-on-linkedin-when-i-call-the-numbers-/articleshow/127894199.cms,"



Texas journalist Sara Gonzales, who knocked on the doors of a few H-1B addresses in Texas, exposing a 'major scam' in the state, has now targeted Indian recruiters offering 'H-1B only' jobs at various US locations on LinkedIn. Gonzales said she visited the websites of the companies and found a common pattern: most of the contact numbers given on the sites do not work, the companies have their offices in India; they have unpolished/ wrong choice of English words on their sites; and they rent out virtual remote coworking space so that they can have an address but no one is there.""Let me be clear to the fraudsters. We are not done. Keep watching. It may be you we are exposing very shortly,"" Gonzales said. The journalist added that it was her expose that prompted Texas Governor Greg Abbott to announce a freeze on H-1B hiring ban in state agencies. Also, Texas AG Ken Paxton announced an investigation into three private companies.Gonzales said she researched for an evening and found an avalanche of information about Indian recruiters posting 'H-1B only' ads on LinkedIn. Revealing their names and the companies they have been hiring for, Gonzales read out one advertisement that was offering jobs only for H-4s, who are dependents of H-1Bs.""This is the whole scheme. You get in, you get to bring your whole family, you bring your children. Then your children need to be taught by another H-1B. And that H-1B brings their family in, and they bring their children. It is a recurring, never-ending cycle,"" Gonzales said adding that H-1B is supposed to be used only when American talent is not found for some very niche skills.The IT consulting firms are double-dipping as they don't pay what they get from the companies to the H-1Bs they hire, the journalist alleged. ""If you are a Green Card holder, if you did immigrate to this country, if you came to this country as a foreign national and paid your dues, and you are now a Green Card holder, you still do not need to apply. We don't want you. We want the non-immigrant visas.

Second case

Third case





Federal prosecutors in Chicago have charged several foreign nationals with running vast Medicare and health insurance fraud schemes that allegedly siphoned more than $1 billion from US government programmes and private insurers by billing for medical equipment and tests that were never provided.Court filings describe shell companies, empty offices and false claims for items such as glucose monitors, catheters and diagnostic tests. Investigators say the schemes relied on stolen patient data and exploited weaknesses in the Medicare system.In the first case, prosecutors charged Anuar Abdrakhmanov, a citizen of Kazakhstan, with conspiracy to launder money linked to Medicare fraud. Court documents say he took over a legitimate medical supply company in Kentucky, Priority One Medical Equipment, and used it to submit about $666 million in false Medicare claims between March and August 2024. Abdrakhmanov entered the United States on a summer work visa in May 2023 that expired four months later but stayed in the country. He became a member and manager of Priority One in April 2024 after buying the company from its previous owner. During this period, Medicare received around 250 complaints from patients who said they never received the equipment they were billed for. Investigators also found that six Medicare beneficiaries in Illinois neither requested nor received glucose monitors or catheters and did not have diabetes.When authorities visited Priority One’s Kentucky office in July 2024, it was empty and not operating. Workers told investigators their only task was to collect mail and send photos of it via the encrypted app Telegram to a supervisor they had never met. Financial records show checks were sent by FedEx to Chicago suburbs, including one $1 million cheque that was misplaced and later recovered, earning the worker a $2,000 bonus. While Medicare suspended payments, Medigap insurers paid at least $450,000. Prosecutors say Abdrakhmanov then wired about $182,000 to Hong Kong and tried to send over $200,000 to other foreign accounts.A second case involves another Kazakhstan national, Tair Smagul, who lived in Chicago and is accused of laundering money tied to a separate Medicare fraud scheme. Prosecutors allege Smagul controlled Connecticut-based Medical Home Care Inc and took part in a nationwide operation that billed nearly $953 million for catheters that were often unnecessary or never delivered.Medicare reportedly got over 27,000 complaints about Medical Home Care. Patients interviewed by investigators said they never received any supplies, and doctors listed as having prescribed the equipment said they never approved itIn a third case, prosecutors charged Pakistani nationals Burhan Mirza and Kashif Iqbal with orchestrating a $10 million fraud involving diagnostic tests and medical equipment. Mirza allegedly ran a business in Pakistan, while Iqbal lived in Texas and worked with US-based accomplices to submit false claims using stolen patient information. Prosecutors say millions were routed through shell companies with fabricated names. Iqbal is also accused of lying to federal investigators about his role.","Federal prosecutors in Chicago have charged several foreign nationals with running vast Medicare and health insurance fraud schemes.

Indian-American businessman Kanwal Singh Rekhi, who became the first Indian-American to take a company public in Silicon Valley, said he is worried about the future amid the divisive atmosphere. The rhetoric against Indians has been heating up and policymakers are accusing Indians of cheating immigration policies, making it harder for Indians to get visas. The overall messaging is that Indians are not welcome in the US, Rekhi noted, saying that when he came to the US, the situation was different. America invited Indian talents not out of generosity but out of necessity.Rekhi traced back the migration of Indians to the US and said the country in the 1960s was not producing enough scientists and engineers and the US was falling behind the Soviet Union. ""So in 1967, with barely enough money to last a semester, I traveled from rural India to Michigan’s Upper Peninsula to pursue a master’s degree in engineering. When we beat the Soviets to the moon, the fate of India and the US became inextricably linked,"" the veteran businessman wrote for San Francisco Chronicle.""After working in the defense industry, I founded Excelan, a startup that produced the ethernet boards that were foundational to the early internet, making me the first Indian American to take a company public in Silicon Valley.At its height, we employed nearly 1,000 people, whose lives and the lives of their families were transformed when we were acquired. Later, as an investor, I funded over 100 startups that created tens of thousands of jobs and pumped billions of dollars into the economy. ""Immigrants are more likely to start a business because they have no safety net, and survival is mandatory.""When I founded my company in the early 1980s, Indian American entrepreneurs were rare. Today, we are everywhere. Roughly a quarter of startups in Silicon Valley involve Indian Americans as founders, investors or board members. Indian Americans have led some of the world’s most influential companies, including Google, Microsoft, Starbucks, IBM and Pepsi. Though we make up about 1.6% of the U.S. population, we account for over 10% of the country’s CEOs, physicians and professors. By nearly every metric — education, income, entrepreneurship — Indian Americans are a case study in what effective immigration policy can produce for the country.""Commenting on the H-1B row that Indians get the maximum of these non-immigrant work visas and then steal jobs from Americans, Rekhi said that it is true that most H-1Bs go to Indians but it is also true that American technology leadership is built in collaboration with foreign talent, particularly Indian talent, he said. The front offices in America and the back offices in India helped both countries and if this trend is reversed now, both will be affected.""India just became the fourth-largest economy in the world, and it will likely become the third-largest by 2030. It’s imperative that the world’s oldest democracy (America) and the world’s largest democracy (India) work together, not only to stay ahead of China on the technological front lines but to stem the rise of authoritarianism globally,"" the investor added.","Kanwal Singh Rekhi, the first Indian-American to take a company public in Silicon Valley, said he is worried about the future amid the divisive atmosphere.

As many Indian-Americans claimed that Republicans lost the election of Senate District 9 in Texas because of their growing hatred against Indians and Hindus, Florida Republican leader Chandler Langevin said this should be all the more reason to deport every Indian in Texas. ""If Republicans lost a special election because of an Indian voting bloc…then they have all the more reason to deport every Indian in Texas,"" Langevin said.In the past few weeks, North Texas has emerged as a seat of India-hatred pushed by politicians, American influencers, and social media commentators.

Texas AG Ken Paxton announced an investigation into three Indian firms that hired H-1B employees in past, asking them to furnish details of each of the employees. A major gold scam involving many Indians and Indian jewelry stores has also been busted in Texas.The loss in a local election in Texas sent MAGA into such a meltdown that a MAGA handle mistook Democrat Taylor Rehmet, who won the election, as an Indian -- going by the 'Rehmet' part of the name.Many MAGA commentators blamed Indian-American voters in the county for the loss -- though the number of Indian-American voters in the county would not have led to the swing, records revealed.President Donald Trump distanced himself from the defeat, though he endorsed Republican candidate Leigh Wambsganss. ""I’m not involved in that. That’s a local Texas race,"" Trump said after the stunning loss. Rehmet said Trump was a non-factor in the local poll and he was focused on the community.Hindu American Foundation executive director Suhag Shukla said Republicans did not have winning strategies with ICE agents shooting people in the streets, racist attacks being hurled on Indian-Americans and politicians calling for shutting down Hindu temples.The Indian-American Advocacy Council said Republicans didn’t lose because of ""Indian voting bloc"" as Indian-Americans are under 2% of the population in the county that went to the election. ""They lost because there are millions of decent, good-faith Americans who don’t want racism, xenophobia, and trash politics running their communities. That’s the truth.

The Merovingian Restaurant Scene.

Neo vs Merovingian | The Matrix Reloaded [IMAX]

Merovingian Resurrections





The year 1999 was a standout year for Hollywood movies. Perhaps the imminent threat of Y2K really released people’s creative juices. In that year, we got the Star Wars prequel classic The Phantom Menace, the misunderstood manifesto of machismo Fight Club, the creepy precursor to Kevin Spacey’s behaviour in American Beauty, the kid who could see dead people in The Sixth Sense, the goofy coming-of-age movie American Pie, and romantic escapades in Notting Hill.But if there is one movie which became part of the cultural lexicon, foreshadowing how all humans would become plugged into the machines and conned by algorithms for a deus ex machina, then it was The Matrix.The Matrix and its sequels (barring the unwatchable The Matrix Resurrections), as a sci-fi franchise, has had a cultural impact hitherto unseen.Many of the terms in The Matrix have become part of our lexicon. Red pill and blue pill became the choice between a hard truth and a comfortable illusion. Waking up meant realising we are surrounded by an illusion. It was the movie that made philosophy cool, that mainstreamed nerd culture, where we suddenly learned how Plato’s man in a cave could make a pretty great plot point because the action was that good.The Matrix also had a host of memorable characters like Neo, a messianic Jesus-like figure who would ultimately sacrifice himself like Jesus, but not before showing off some cool kung fu moves.Then there’s Trinity, named after the Holy Trinity, whose faith in Neo makes him the One. Morpheus, named after the Greek god of dreams, is the one who wakes people up from their slumber and tells them walk the path.Even the side characters are super cool.Take the Merovingian, a character so suave and French that his tie knot immediately became a fashion statement and he could Emmaneul Macron fashion tips.Suave, smug, impeccably dressed, and aggressively French, the Merovingian was an old program who survived by running a black-market empire inside the Matrix. His tie knot alone became a fashion statement. Named after the Frankish dynasty that once ruled large parts of Europe and later spawned myths about being descendants of Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene, the Merovingian’s symbolism was as in your face as a Truth Social post by the Orange one. He existed in the shadows of power, ancient, connected, and convinced of his own immorality.For those who don’t remember, the Merovingian (also called the Frenchman) is an old program (or operating system) that resides in the Matrix and operates a smuggling ring providing a haven for exiled programs. He is a trafficker of information, loves living the high life, has a partner who helps him run his criminal syndicate, talks with utmost smug superiority, keeps old programs like trophies, sells access to the powers-that-be, operates from private spaces as theatres of control, hides behind moral relativism as his philosophy (“It’s all a game, it’s always been a game”), and pretends he has all the answers.When Morpheus asks him in the restaurant scene, “Do you know why we are here?”, he replies without batting an eyelid: “I am a trafficker of information, I know everything I can. The question is, do you know why you are here?”And of course, he loves controlling programs around him, putting a tiny bit of code in a woman’s dessert as a means to control her.Not to mention that he believes he’s infallible, telling Neo during a fight: “Boy, I have survived your predecessors, and mark my words, I will survive you.”Remind you of anyone?Strip away the French, the programs, and the green tint, and the Merovingian is exactly like Jeffrey Epstein , the disgraced paedophile who appears to have been friends with every single individual of note in the WENA elite circle.The Merovingian’s lines could very well be Epstein’s guiding philosophies. The Merovingian’s worldview was transactional and cynical: “You see, there is only one constant… causality. Action. Reaction. Cause and effect.”Similarly, Epstein’s entire modus operandi was based on being a connector and facilitator who “knows things” and can “open doors”. The Frenchman also loved mocking the illusion of choice, which he claimed was between those with power and those without. Morality was a theatre for the poor. Both used different forms of hedonism — food, sex, language, aesthetics and more — as means of demonstrating control without force.Both archetypes posed resistance as futile, believing that the system would favour them forever. The Merovingian’s philosophy of causality mirrors this worldview perfectly. He rejects choice, mocks morality, and insists that all behaviour is simply a response to desire. Control the appetite, and you control the outcome.Epstein’s system operated on the same premise. He targeted vulnerability, ambition, fear and greed, reducing human agency to transaction. He controlled the most powerful people in the world, coerced them not through force but a degree of perverseness far beyond the realms of polite culture. Epstein did not need force because the system had already mastered what Manufacturing Consent described decades ago, a logic made only more unsettling by the fact that Noam Chomsky himself was someone Epstein was pally with.What makes the parallel even more chilling is how both figures overestimate their own permanence. The Merovingian boasts that he has survived every previous One and will survive Neo as well.Epstein behaved as if his insulation was eternal, as if his proximity to power made him untouchable. But intermediaries are only valuable until they are not. Once their utility fades (or their deeds become known) the system discards them without sentiment.When we meet the Merovingian again decades later (in The Matrix Resurrections), he is reduced to a ranting relic, stripped of relevance, furious not because he has lost morality, but because he has lost access. Epstein’s collapse follows the same structural logic. The moment the cost of protecting him outweighed the benefit, the network withdrew its shield.When The Matrix first came out, it was heralded as era-defining science fiction.Little did we know it was a foreshadowing of our lives, where we would all become so jacked into our devices that we would forget our real lives, where our every action would be judged by an algorithm tweak, where we would use small machines to peer into the lives of others instead of living our own. And that we would willingly submit ourselves, like Aldous Huxley predicted, not because of oppression but because of convenience.The real deus ex machina was never the machines with tentacles. It was the invisible architecture that learned how to manage human longing itself. And little did we know that the entire operating system was being run by a few men who could control each other’s guilt.",The Matrix and its sequels (barring the unwatchable The Matrix Resurrections) has had a cultural impact hitherto unseen. Red pill and blue pill became the choice between a hard truth and a comfortable illusion.

Imran Khan’s Sisters Allege Illegal Isolation, Stage Protest Outside Adiala Jail





A Pakistani anti-terrorism court (ATC) on Tuesday issued non-bailable arrest warrants against Aleema Khan, sister of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan in connection with a protest held in Islamabad in November 2024.According to news agency PTI citing a media report, the warrants were issued by the ATC in Rawalpindi after Aleema Khan failed to appear before the court despite earlier directions.The court also issued non-bailable arrest warrants against her two guarantors and ordered that all three be arrested and produced before it on Wednesday, without fail. Aleema’s application seeking exemption from personal appearance was rejected.The case, registered at Sadiqabad Police Station, relates to a protest at D-Chowk in Islamabad on November 24, 2024 and includes charges of protesting against the government, chanting anti-government slogans, vandalism and stone-pelting. ATC Judge Amjad Ali Shah conducted the hearing.The court also issued a show-cause notice to the Superintendent of Police (SP), Rawal, for failing to execute the arrest warrants.The SP has been directed to appear before the court on Wednesday and explain why Aleema Khan was not arrested and presented despite clear orders, according to Pakistani news website Express Tribune.During Monday’s hearing, Aleema Khan’s defence counsel sought a one-day exemption, citing difficulties in travel and daily affairs after her bank accounts, Computerised National Identity Card and passport were reportedly blocked. The court, however, did not accept the plea.The proceedings have drawn attention as Aleema Khan had earlier skipped multiple hearings in the case and appeared only after the court issued property seizure orders and several arrest warrants. She is among those nominated as accused in protest-related cases filed following the November demonstrations.The protest followed Imran Khan’s “final call” for nationwide demonstrations demanding the restoration of the party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) electoral mandate, the release of party leaders and the reversal of constitutional changes.The D-Chowk protest ended on November 26 after a security operation, with several cases registered across Rawalpindi district. In total, 29 cases linked to the protest have been filed in the district, with Imran Khan named in several and his wife, Bushra Bibi, charged in all 29 cases.","Pakistani anti-terrorism court issues non-bailable arrest warrants against Aleema Khan.

Troops ‘physically handicapped’ by vast terrain

Insurgency background and wider fallout





Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif said the country’s security forces are “physically handicapped” by the sheer size of Balochistan as they battle a fresh surge in militant violence, after authorities reported killing 177 insurgents in sweeping counter-terror operations across the province.Addressing the national assembly, Asif described the scale of the challenge facing troops deployed in Pakistan’s largest and least populated province, where coordinated attacks triggered one of the deadliest security crises in recent years. His remarks came after militants launched simultaneous assaults in multiple towns, targeting civilians, homes and security installations.“Balochistan constitutes over 40 per cent of Pakistan geographically...To control it is much more difficult than a populated city, and it needs deployment of massive forces. Our troops are deployed there and are in action against them (terrorists), but they are physically handicapped by guarding and patrolling such a big area,” Asif told lawmakers, as quoted by PTI.Security officials said the death toll of militants had risen to 177 in the past two days following large-scale raids and gun battles.The operations were launched after insurgents carried out coordinated attacks at 12 locations, with authorities confirming that at least 17 police and security personnel were killed, along with dozens of civilians.Asif said the weekend violence claimed 33 civilian lives and 17 members of the security forces. He ruled out talks with the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), saying no negotiations would be held with “terrorists” responsible for killing civilians, including women and children.Balochistan, which borders Iran and Afghanistan, has long faced a separatist insurgency driven by ethnic Baloch groups who accuse the central government of discrimination and exploitation. Authorities say groups such as the BLA have targeted security forces, infrastructure and projects linked to the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor.Train services between Balochistan and the rest of Pakistan remained suspended for a third day, while mobile and internet services were cut in several districts during clean-up operations. Provincial officials said services were expected to resume once the security situation stabilised.Asif dismissed claims that Balochistan had been neglected, saying the province had seen development, including multiple airports. He also rejected the “missing persons” narrative, alleging that names of militants killed in operations had appeared on such lists. “This narrative has been concocted. I also used to support this cause and protest over it. But, terrorists and criminal elements have hijacked all these narratives,” he said.","Khawaja Asif says security forces are 'physically handicapped' by sheer size of Balochistan.

In a bizarre case, police in Pakistan’s Rawalpindi district registered a case on Sunday of abduction against a “jinn” (supernatural spirit) following the disappearance of an 11-year-old boy, news agency ANI reported, citing ARY News.The incident occurred in the garrison city when the boy went missing from his home on January 21. After ten days without any sign of the child, his father approached the Taxila Police Station and filed a First Information Report (FIR).In the FIR, the father alleged that supernatural entities, known locally as jinns, had forced his son to run away.The complainant said that this is not the first time such an incident has occurred. He added that the jinns had “abducted” his son several times before.He highlighted that while the boy had returned home after previous incidents, this time ten days had passed without his return, prompting him to formally accuse the supernatural spirits of kidnapping.According to ARY News, similar claims have been reported in Pakistan’s legal system before. In Lahore, a mother had lodged a case against jinns over the disappearance of her married daughter, a matter that eventually reached the courts.A report by Dawn in September stated that a special investigation team of Lahore police was formed under the directions of the city's high court Chief Justice Aalia Neelam to probe the six-year-old case of the missing woman, believed to have been abducted by a jinn.The team, headed by Lahore Investigation DIG Zeeshan Raza, was tasked with locating and recovering the woman.","11-year-old boy went missing from his home in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, on January 21.

(With PTI inputs)





Combat-related deaths in Pakistan rose 43% month-on-month to 361 in January, data released on Monday by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) showed.The fatalities included 242 militants, 73 civilians, and 46 security personnel, according to the Islamabad-based think tank.At least 135 people were injured, among them 71 were civilians, 52 security personnel, and 12 militants.PICSS reported 87 militant attacks across Pakistan in January, a 28% rise from the 68 incidents recorded in December 2025. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa bore the brunt, with 58 incidents—38 in the mainland districts and 20 in the tribal areas. The restive Balochistan followed with 27 attacks, while Punjab reported two targeted incidents.Balochistan emerged as the main theatre of militant violence and security operations, recording its highest monthly militant death toll since the current insurgency began in 2001. While the province remained relatively calm for most of January, violence surged dramatically in the final two days. Coordinated attacks by the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) across at least 12 locations, followed by intensified security operations, placed the province at the centre of the conflict.At least 172 militants were killed, the majority in the final two days of last month.Security forces arrested at least 60 suspected militants during the previous month, while militant groups kidnapped eight individuals. In Punjab, 53 militants were arrested, 48 of them from Lahore, the state capital and Pakistan's second-largest city.Meanwhile, no militant attacks were reported in January from Sindh, Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), Islamabad, or the Gilgit-Baltistan region, according to the data.","Combat-related deaths in Pakistan rose 43% month-on-month to 361 in January.

Balochistan Crisis: Pakistan-Origin Commentator Takes Apart Islamabad, Exposes Lies On India

What is clear: the scale, coordination and symbolism of the violence mark a sharp escalation in a conflict long treated by Islamabad as containable.

Why it matters

The big picture

What's different now is the interplay of three key factors:

Zoom in: What is ""Herof""?

Herof Phase 2.0 expands on that template:

Geographic spread: Violence has been reported in Quetta, Noshki, Mastung, Kalat, Kharan, Panjgur, Gwadar, Pasni, Turbat, Kech and Awaran.

Operational depth: Suicide bombings, vehicle-borne explosives and armed assaults occurred almost simultaneously.

Human footprint: For the first time, women are reported to be participating in direct combat roles alongside men.

What they are saying

Between the lines

Zoom in: Bashir Zaib's message

The regional angle

What’s next

The bottom line





Pakistan's latest surge of violence in Balochistan reflects a deepening, not isolated, security crisis as the Baloch Liberation Army escalates its campaign through ""Operation Herof.""Over several days, the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) unleashed what it calls ""Operation Herof, Phase 2.0,"" a wave of coordinated attacks across Balochistan that included suicide bombings, gun assaults and arson in major towns and remote districts alike.Pakistani authorities say dozens of civilians and security personnel were killed, followed by one of the largest counterterrorism strikes in decades. Officials claim more than 130 militants were killed in 48 hours alone. However, the BLA has refuted these official claims and reiterate that it inflicted severe casualties on Pakistan forces.Balochistan sits at the intersection of Pakistan’s security, economy and foreign policy- and all three are now under strain. The province anchors China’s Belt and Road ambitions through the port of Gwadar, hosts globally significant mineral deposits at Reko Diq, and borders both Iran and Afghanistan at a time of regional instability.As analyst Michael Kugelman put it after the attacks, ""Today’s attacks in Balochistan should serve as a wake up call to those… keen to invest in Pakistan’s critical mineral reserves."" He warned that many of those reserves lie in areas now directly hit by violence- and that resentment over ""external exploitation of local resources"" is central to the insurgency.For Islamabad, the stakes go beyond security. Investor confidence, relations with Beijing, and Pakistan’s credibility as a destination for critical minerals are all on the line.Balochistan's troubles are hardly new, but they're shiftingSince Pakistan's birth, Baloch ethnic factions have, time and again, risen up against the central government. They've sought more autonomy, a larger share of the country's wealth, or even complete independence. Each insurrection has been met with military force, temporary quiet, and, ultimately, unaddressed issues.First, economic importance. Balochistan is now crucial to Pakistan's economic story. Think of the Chinese-funded projects and the West's interest in copper, gold, and rare minerals.Second, political disillusionment. Elections since 2018 have been widely criticized, and the space for peaceful opposition has shrunk. This has intensified the feeling that political solutions are impossible.Third, the evolution of militant groups. Organizations like the BLA have become more dangerous, adept at using the media, and ideologically focused. They've adopted tactics from global insurgencies while staying rooted in local grievances.As per a report in the Native Voices: ""Herof is a Balochi literary term meaning ""black storm"", commonly used in Baloch poetry, including by the veteran poet Karim Dashti.""The BLA first used the term in August 2024, launching Herof 1.0 with attacks across 12 districts. That campaign shocked authorities by striking areas previously considered relatively stable, including Lasbela and Musakhel, and by introducing a female suicide bomber into the group’s operations.An intelligence officer cited by Native Voices estimated 800 to 1,000 fighters may be involved- a number that suggests months of recruitment, training and coordination.Pakistani officials describe the violence as foreign-orchestrated terrorism.Balochistan chief minister Sarfraz Bugti said security forces killed 145 members of what he termed ""Fitna al-Hindustan,"" the state’s label for the BLA. He claimed militants aimed to seize hostages and storm government installations, and alleged backing from India and Afghanistan- accusations both countries deny.Residents recount chaos and fear. ""(It) was a very scary day in the history of Quetta,"" said Khan Muhammad, a local resident, describing armed men openly patrolling streets before security forces moved in.India’s foreign ministry rejected Pakistan’s claims, calling them ""baseless,"" and urged Islamabad to address ""long-standing demands of its people in the region"" instead of deflecting blame outward.As per the Native Voices, the Baloch resentment has roots in a series of flashpoints.Several incidents hardened public anger: the killing of university student Hayat Baloch by paramilitary forces in 2020; the death of Malik Naz inside her home the same year; the crackdown on the Haq Do Tehreek protests in Gwadar; and the custodial killing of Baalach Mula Baksh in 2023. Each episode sparked protests. Each was followed by arrests, internet shutdowns, or worse.The arrest of activist Dr Mahrang Baloch in 2025 marked another turning point. To many young Baloch, her detention signaled that even peaceful dissent had become intolerable. Analysts say that belief has fed recruitment into armed groups, including among women, a shift now visible on the battlefield.Each episode narrowed political space- and widened the insurgency’s recruitment pool.As Kugelman noted, framing the crisis solely around body counts ""telegraphs your policy failures- because the question is why are there so many fighters to start with."" Analysts argue the BLA has successfully tapped into accumulated resentment, especially among young Baloch who see peaceful activism punished and armed resistance rewarded with attention.One of the most striking elements of Herof II has been its media choreography.As per the Native Voices, the BLA released new footage of its leader Bashir Zaib, seated on the back of a motorcycle, moving through rugged terrain believed to lie between Kharan and Chagai- a region synonymous with mineral wealth.Observers see layered symbolism: mobility, control and defiance. A senior Baloch journalist described the location choice as deliberate- close to Reko Diq and other high-profile mining sites that have drawn interest from companies like Barrick Gold and financiers such as the Asian Development Bank.The subtext to Islamabad and investors alike: the insurgency can operate where Pakistan’s economic future is being planned.Timing matters.Analysts believe the BLA launched Herof II amid unrest in neighboring Iran’s Baloch-populated regions and persistent instability in Afghanistan to amplify its message beyond Pakistan’s borders.Balochistan’s long frontier with Iran- and proximity to Gulf shipping lanes- means sustained violence here resonates in Middle Eastern, US and European policy circles, particularly as Western governments search for alternatives to Chinese-dominated mineral supply chains.The message appears aimed as much at foreign capitals as at Islamabad.In the short term, security operations will intensify. Expect heavier troop deployments, stricter controls around mining projects, transport corridors and Chinese-linked infrastructure, and continued information blackouts during operations. Islamabad will likely double down on its claims of foreign sponsorship, even as evidence remains contested.The longer-term trajectory is murkier.The paradox facing Pakistan is stark: Balochistan is now too economically important to ignore- but remains too politically neglected to stabilize.Unless that gap is addressed, the ""black storm"" the BLA invokes may only deepen, reshaping the conflict from a peripheral insurgency into a central challenge to the state.The spy-action film Dhurandhar has inadvertently revived global interest in the region by featuring elements that touch on Pakistan’s underworld and geopolitics set around Baloch communities.Dhurandhar revolves around a simple but unsettling idea: in covert conflict, what matters most is not the spectacle of action but the slow, almost invisible shifts beneath it. That logic offers a useful lens for what’s happening in Balochistan.Today, Balochistan can no longer be treated only as a security issue measured through attacks and casualties. It has become a political problem rooted in governance, representation, and legitimacy, and it cannot be managed through messaging, denial, or communication blackouts.","Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) unleashed what it calls ""Operation Herof, Phase 2.0,"" a wave of coordinated attacks across Balochistan that included suicide bombings, gun assaults and arson in major towns and remote districts alike.

Emergency teams have been deployed in multiple cities.No reports of civilian casuality has been reported by the officials as of now.Confirming the attack, a senior official stated that the attack was ""coordinated but poorly executed."" He also said that the insurgents could not inflict damage due to the swift security response.""The attacks failed due to poor planning and rapid collapse under an effective security response.""The situation is yet to get under control, as per the reports.For decades, Pakistan has faced a separatist insurgency in Balochistan, a mineral-rich southwestern province bordering Afghanistan and Iran, where rebels have repeatedly targeted security forces, foreign nationals, and people from outside the region.","At least 15 civilians, 18 security personnel and 92 rebels were killed after Baloch separatist fighters carried out a “coordinated” wave of attacks across 12 locations in Pakistan’s Balochistan province.

Pak PM Shehbaz Sharif Says He Begged For Funds With Asim Munir As Pakistan Buys Global Influence





Pakistan prime minister Shehbaz Sharif revealed that both he and field marshal Asim Munir were forced to 'beg' billions in loans from friendly nations to bridge the country’s external financing gap.Speaking to leading exporters and business leaders at an event in Islamabad, Sharif said Pakistan’s growing dependence on foreign loans is humiliating and often forces officials to agree to unjustifiable demands.""We feel ashamed when Field Marshal Asim Munir and I go around the world begging for money,” he said, reported ANI citing local news.“Taking loans is a huge burden on our self-respect. Our heads bow down in shame.We cannot say NO to many things they want us to do,” Sharif added.Sharif praised Pakistan’s key allies—China, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar—for standing by Islamabad through difficult times, calling China the country’s “all-weather friend.”This is not the first time the premier has expressed discomfort over seeking loans. In January 2023, he said it embarrassed him to ask for further loans, despite acknowledging Saudi Arabia’s financial support.He has repeatedly stressed the need for Pakistan to achieve self-sufficiency and reduce dependence on IMF programmes.Notably, Pakistan is currently facing a severe debt crisis, with total public debt exceeding Rs 76,000 billion as of March 2025, nearly doubling in just four years. The nation relies heavily on IMF bailouts and loans from China--particularly for China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) projects--to manage debt servicing and avoid default.In September 2024, the IMF approved a $7 billion bailout for Pakistan under its Extended Fund Facility (EFF), followed by a $1.4 billion loan under its climate resilience fund in May 2025, aimed at strengthening economic stability and climate resilience.","Pak PM Shehbaz Sharif Says He Begged For Funds With Asim Munir.

Imran Khan Tagged ‘Security Threat’ As Pakistan Army Launches Fiercest Public Attack In Years





The Pakistani government is doubling down on its legal offensive against jailed former prime minister Imran Khan and prominent activists, framing the measures as essential for “national security. ” However, as prison doors remain barred to visitors and human rights lawyers face decade-long sentences, critics warn that the country’s democratic space is vanishing under the shadow of military influence.Officials say restrictions placed on Khan, including the suspension of prison visits, were imposed after he violated jail rules that prohibit political activity and the dissemination of what authorities describe as anti-state narratives. The government and military deny claims that the measures amount to illegal isolation or an attempt to silence him.Interior minister Talal Chaudhry has rejected allegations of mistreatment, calling Khan “the most privileged prisoner in Pakistan” and citing access to facilities such as gym equipment and a personal cook. He said the restrictions were lawful and in line with prison regulations.The government also dismisses accusations that the military is driving political decisions.“The civilian government is [taking] decisions. We are all working hand in glove,” Chaudhry said, praising the chief of defence forces as “doing a marvellous job,"" as quoted by BBC. Security sources insist the military operates strictly within constitutional and legal limits.Military spokespersons have argued that certain political narratives pose a growing threat to national security, particularly when a convicted politician is accused of using prison meetings to mobilise public opinion against state institutions. Officials say such actions cross the boundary from political expression into matters of national defence.Authorities stress that legal action against politicians, activists and lawyers is based on violations of existing laws, including the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (PECA), rather than an effort to suppress dissent. “Attempts to frame law-breaking as democracy or human rights are entirely misplaced,” Chaudhry said.The same legal rationale underpinned the recent conviction of human rights lawyer Imaan Mazari and her husband, Hadi Ali Chattha. The couple were sentenced to 10 years in prison after being found guilty of sharing what the state described as anti-state content on social media.According to prosecutors and the court ruling, their online activity involved “disseminating and propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups” and undermined state institutions. Defending the verdict, information minister Attaullah Tarar said it reflected the proper application of the law, posting on X: “As you sow, so you shall reap!”The government maintains that these measures are necessary to prevent destabilisation and ensure accountability, regardless of an individual’s political profile or public standing.Critics, however, argue that the cases of Khan and Mazari show that he is not the only one being silenced, and warn that the space for dissent in Pakistan is narrowing as the military’s influence continues to loom large over civilian life.",Pakistani government doubles down on legal offensive against jailed former PM Imran Khan.

Imran Khan Tagged ‘Security Threat’ As Pakistan Army Launches Fiercest Public Attack In Years





Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) on Tuesday expressed serious concern over the health of its jailed founder and former prime minister Imran Khan . The party stated that credible reports suggest that he is suffering from a serious eye condition that could lead to permanent vision loss if not treated urgently.In a statement posted on social media, the party said that Imran had reportedly been diagnosed with central retinal vein occlusion in his right eye, describing it as a dangerous blockage of the retinal vein that requires immediate and specialised medical care.PTI demanded that Imran be allowed an “unrestricted meeting” with his family and be shifted to a hospital of his choice for treatment, news agency ANI repeorted citing Dawn.According to the party, medical experts who examined Imran inside Adiala jail warned that the condition was extremely sensitive and carried a high risk of permanent damage if not treated promptly.PTI alleged that despite this advice, jail authorities were insisting on providing treatment within the prison, even though the specialist reportedly said such care required an operation theatre and advanced medical facilities.Calling the approach “reckless”, the party said Imran’s eyesight and overall health were in “grave danger”. It also claimed that Imran last met his personal physician in October 2024 and that no further examination had been allowed since then, despite directives from the Islamabad High Court. PTI added that a petition seeking regular medical check-ups had been pending since August 2025.“This is a blatant violation of court orders and a gross breach of fundamental human rights,” the party said, alleging that the government was prioritising political vendetta over a prisoner’s health.PTI warned that if Imran suffered permanent damage to his eyesight, the government and the Adiala jail administration would be held responsible for obstructing his treatment despite medical advice and court orders.The party appealed to the judiciary to treat the issue as one of health and human life rather than politics and demanded that Imran be allowed to undergo treatment at Shaukat Khanum Hospital or any other reputable hospital of his choice.Shaukat Khanum Hospital, founded by Imran Khan, also voiced concern, stating that it was “gravely concerned” about his condition.While expressing confidence in the doctors currently attending to him, the hospital requested that its medical team be allowed immediate access to examine Imran and participate in his care to reassure those concerned about his welfare.Meanwhile, Imran Khan’s sisters questioned the authenticity of reports about his eye condition, saying they had received no official information from jail authorities. Speaking to reporters outside Adiala jail, Noreen Khanum said the family had not been informed of any such diagnosis.“If this is true, we should have been informed so that we could have taken him to the hospital for treatment,” she said, alleging that rumours were being spread to mislead and distress people. She maintained that Imran was healthy and warned against any harm being caused to him.Another sister, Aleema Khanum, said that the jail administration was not sharing updates with the family or legal team and questioned how such information could be leaked without official involvement.“We have just one demand: release Imran Khan,” she said, adding that he had remained incarcerated for over two-and-a-half years because he refused to seek release through a deal.Uzma Khanum said that she last met Imran on December 2 last year and that he did not mention any eyesight issues during that meeting, according to Dawn.However, she recalled that during an earlier visit he had complained of an infection in his right eye and was only given eye drops. “At present, we don’t know anything about the condition of his eye as we are not allowed to meet him,” she said.PTI later claimed that Aleema Khanum was stopped by the police while returning from Adiala jail. The opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan alleged that Imran’s sisters were “wrongfully confined” and described it as another misuse of state power.The alliance demanded access for Imran’s family, respect for the right to peaceful assembly and movement, and action against those responsible.Separately, PTI lawmakers arrived at the Islamabad High Court to file a fresh petition seeking permission to meet Imran. PTI chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said Tuesdays were designated for meetings but repeated requests had gone unanswered. He stressed that meeting a prisoner was a legal right and expressed concern over the health of both Imran and his wife, Bushra Bibi.","Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) expressed serious concern over the health of its jailed founder and former prime minister Imran Khan.

Is a wider terror alliance forming? Pakistan's Lashkar commander admits links to Hamas,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/is-a-wider-terror-alliance-forming-pakistans-lashkar-commander-admits-links-to-hamas/articleshow/127690725.cms,"(IANS photo)

Hamas Seeks To Place 10,000 Police In New US-Backed Gaza Authority Ahead Of Disarmament Talks





Is a bigger terror nexus in the making? A senior Lashkar-e-Taiba commander operating from Pakistan has openly acknowledged links with Hamas, a Middle East-based group often at violent odds with Israel. The two US-designated terrorist organisations have held meetings to discuss expanding their scale and cooperation.This development comes against the backdrop of US President Donald Trump 's proposal to send Pakistani troops to Gaza as part of his ‘Board of Peace’ initiative, aimed at promoting stability and peace in the war-torn region.The proposal was signed and accepted by Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif .While, in a video, a commander of the Pakistani Markazi Muslim League, regarded as the political front of LeT, admitted that he met with Hamas leadership in Doha in 2024.According to a report by the US-based Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI), the well-documented nexus between Hamas and terror groups Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad operating openly on Pakistani soil could undermine international counterterrorism efforts, endangering both regional stability and Western security interests. On January 15, 2026, the US-led intergovernmental organisation Board of Peace, whose stated purpose is to “promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict” in Gaza, was established.On January 18, US President Donald Trump, acting as chair of the organisation, invited Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to join it. However, Pakistan allows Hamas representatives to operate freely on its soil, participate in public events, and forge alliances with local militant groups. This conduct undermines Western efforts to diplomatically isolate Hamas and raises serious questions about whether the United States should continue to regard Pakistan as a 'major non-Nato ally'.The partnership between Lashkar-e-Taiba and Hamas is emerging as a new terror nexus, which could draw the attention of countries like India, Israel, and the United States.The world focuses on demilitarising Hamas in Gaza, ignoring Pakistan’s increasing role as a potential safe haven could allow the group to regroup and strengthen after its Middle East operations.Months ago, Hafiz Saeed-led Lashkar suffered a major setback in India’s Operation Sindoor , when precision strikes destroyed its headquarters in Muridke. The organisation may now seek a base farther from India.The recent confession by LeT commander Faisal Nadeem indicates the formation of a front that could engage the attention of nations such as India. Pakistan has a long history of cultivating terror groups that target India, while Hamas continues similar operations against Israel.The MEMRI report also highlighted videos and images from recent events in Pakistan, including the January 2026 LeT-linked gathering in Gujranwala, featuring senior Hamas representative Naji Zaheer alongside LeT operative Rashid Ali Sandhu. These developments underline the growing nexus between Hamas and Pakistan-based terrorist groups. The mastermind of the Pahalgam terror attack in April 2025, Saifullah Kesari, was also reportedly with Nadeem in Doha, a fact the commander confirmed.",A senior Lashkar-e-Taiba commander operating from Pakistan has openly acknowledged links with Hamas.

NEW DELHI: India advised Pakistan to ""introspect"" on some of its recent moves, including the 27th Amendment that gave ""life-time immunity to its chief of defence forces” Asim Munir ""It could start by asking itself how it has let its armed forces engineer a constitutional coup through the 27th amendment and giving life-time immunity to its Chief of Defence Forces,” said India’s permanent representative to the UN, ambassador Parvathaneni Harish on Tuesday.Further, he said that Pakistan is ""well advised to introspect about the rule of law.""Pakistan’s Parliament passed the 27th Constitutional Amendment in November last year under its Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s government, granting lifelong legal immunity to field marshal Asim Munir. The amendment provides protection from prosecution for actions taken during his tenure, drawing sharp criticism from opposition parties and civil society groups over concerns of accountability and constitutional overreach.Harish strongly criticised Pakistan for raising the Kashmir issue again at the UN and said that the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir ""has been, is, and will always remain an integral and inalienable part of India"".Speaking on the Indus Waters Treaty , Harish said that Pakistan has ""violated the spirit of the Treaty by inflicting three wars and thousands of terror attacks on India"".“Throughout these six and a half decades, Pakistan has violated the spirit of the Treaty by inflicting three wars and thousands of terror attacks on India.Thousands of Indian lives have been lost in Pakistan-sponsored terror attacks,” he said.In the wake of the Pahalgam terror attack, he said India was “compelled to finally announce that the Treaty will be held in abeyance until Pakistan, a global epicentre of terror, credibly and irrevocably ends its support for cross-border and all other forms of terrorism.”","Pakistan's Parliament passed the 27th Constitutional Amendment in November last year under its Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s government, granting lifelong legal immunity to field marshal Asim Munir.

"Wedding horror in Pakistan: 7 killed, 25 injured after suicide bomber targets marriage ceremony",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/wedding-horror-in-pakistan-7-killed-25-injured-after-suicide-bomber-targets-marriage-ceremony/articleshow/127364816.cms,"



A wedding celebration turned into a scene of devastation in Pakistan’s north-west after a suicide bomber blew himself up among guests, killing at least seven people and injuring around 25 others, officials said. The attack took place on Friday night in Dera Ismail Khan district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.Police said the blast occurred at the home of Noor Alam Mehsud, a pro-government peace committee leader, where a marriage ceremony was under way. Witnesses said guests had been dancing to the beat of drums when the attacker struck, detonating an explosive vest inside a crowded room.District Police Officer Sajjad Ahmed Sahibzada confirmed it was a suicide bombing. The force of the explosion caused part of the roof to collapse, trapping several people under debris and complicating rescue efforts. An emergency was declared at the District Headquarters Hospital as ambulances rushed casualties from the site.Bilal Ahmed Faizi, spokesperson for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Rescue 1122, said multiple ambulances, along with fire and disaster response vehicles, were deployed. Rescue teams worked through the rubble to pull out victims, with some of the wounded reported to be in critical condition.No group immediately claimed responsibility. However, suspicion is likely to fall on Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Pakistani Taliban, which has carried out frequent attacks in the region. The group is separate from but allied with the Afghan Taliban and has grown more active since the Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan in 2021. Many TTP fighters are believed to operate from across the border.Authorities sealed off the area and launched an investigation. Initial reports suggested that Waheedullah Mehsud, also known as Jigri Mehsud, was among those killed.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Sohail Afridi condemned the attack and sought a report from the provincial police chief, saying those responsible would be brought to justice. Governor Faisal Karim Kundi also expressed grief and ordered that the injured receive full medical support.","Attack took place in Dera Ismail Khan district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

Massive power blackout pushes Chile into chaos,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/massive-power-blackout-pushes-chile-into-chaos/articleshow/118570148.cms,"Why did the blackout happen?

Present situation



A major power outage left much of Chile in darkness, disrupting daily life, halting transport, and forcing businesses to stay shut on Tuesday. The government declared a state of emergency and imposed a mandatory curfew until 6 am Wednesday, (local time) as officials scrambled to restore electricity.The blackout, which began in the late afternoon, took down the internet and mobile networks, stranded public transport, and even obstructed the country’s crucial copper mining operations. Water shortages were also reported as electric pumps failed while hospital and government buildings resorted to functioning on emergency generators.Traffic lights failed and subway services in Santiago along with other cities were put to a standstill, leaving passengers trapped in dark tunnels. Daily activities such as classes, football matches and restaurants and cinema business were also suspended, leading to revenue loss around the country.Interior minister Carolina Toha described the situation as a crisis, though the exact cause of the outage remained unclear.“Our priority is public safety,” she said, announcing that security forces had been deployed to control traffic and prevent disorder. “Obviously, this was something no one planned for.”By 10 pm, more than five hours into the blackout, none of the 14 affected regions had fully recovered electricity, leaving at least 7 million people without power.Chile’s grid operator, the National Electrical Coordinator, attributed the blackout to the failure of a disrupted high-voltage transmission line that was the backbone of the system carrying power from the Atacama desert of northern Chile to the capital in the country’s central valley. However, the exact reason for the breakdown of the grid, still remains unknown.Speaking to news agency AP, a Santiago resident Jorge Calderón described the scene as “chaos.” He worried about food spoiling in the summer heat, while others feared being trapped in lifts or stuck in their homes without working elevators.Authorities worked to evacuate people from subway stations in cities including Santiago and Valparaíso, while transport minister Juan Carlos Muñoz urged residents to stay home, warning that just merely 27 per cent of the capital’s traffic lights were functional.At Santiago International Airport, emergency power was activated, though officials cautioned that flights might be disrupted. Meanwhile, Chile’s state-owned copper giant, Codelco, also confirmed its mining operations had been severely affected by the outage.Videos circulating on social media showed scenes of confusion across Chile, a country stretching over 4,300 km (2,600 miles) along the Pacific coast. In the capital city of Santiago, people used their mobile phones as torches in the underground metro, while police were seen helping evacuate buildings.Efforts to restore electricity continued through the night, however, with millions still in darkness, the government remained on high alert.","At least 7 million people in Chile were left without power on Tuesday.

United States Vice President JD Vance recalled a heated exchange of words with a Ukrainian immigrant in the backdrop of the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, which broke out in February 2022.Sharing the run-in with the Ukranian-American man, Trump's deputy said immigrants must identify themselves as Americans and should look out for the interests of the United States.""During my senate campaign in 2022, I met a Ukrainian-American man in NE Ohio. He was very angry about my views on the conflict, and my desire to bring it to a rapid close. ""You are trying to abandon my country, and I don't like it."" ""Sir, I replied, ""your country is the United States of America, and so is mine,"" Vance posted on X.Calling it offensive for an immigrant to ""use"" the USA to settle ethnic rivalries, Vance said: ""One of the most important parts of assimilation is seeing ""your"" country as the USA"".""I always found it offensive that a new immigrant to our country would be willing to use the power and influence of their new nation to settle the ethnic rivalries of the old.

Vance wrote.Vance's post comes days after the United States aligned with Russia at the United Nations, voting against a resolution condemning Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.The move, under newly elected US President Donald Trump, has strained US-Europe ties and raised doubts about Washington’s shifting stance on the Russia-Ukraine war.The UN general assembly vote saw the US and Russia opposing a Europe-backed Ukrainian resolution that directly accused Moscow of aggression and demanded an immediate withdrawal of Russian troops. The resolution was passed with 93 votes in favour, 18 against, and 65 abstentions.","US Vice President JD Vance recalled heated exchange of words with a Ukrainian immigrant in 2022.

‘Tyranny of the judiciary’: Elon Musk blasts federal judge for blocking Trump’s refugee order,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/tyranny-of-the-judiciary-elon-musk-blasts-federal-judge-for-blocking-trumps-refugee-order/articleshow/118569781.cms,"Elon Musk

Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has criticised the US judiciary following a federal judge’s decision to block President Donald Trump’s executive order pausing refugee admissions . Musk, in a post on X, questioned the judiciary’s power over presidential authority, calling it a threat to democracy.“If any judge anywhere can block every presidential order everywhere, we do not have democracy, we have tyranny of the judiciary,” Musk wrote.Musk’s remarks come after US District Judge Jamal Whitehead, a Biden-appointed judge based in Seattle, issued an injunction against Trump’s directive, which sought to indefinitely halt refugee admissions. The judge ruled that the order effectively nullified existing federal law and overstepped the president’s authority.“To be sure, the president has substantial discretion … to suspend refugee admissions, but that authority is not limitless,” Whitehead said in his ruling from the bench. “I cannot ignore Congress’ detailed framework for refugee admissions and the limits it placed on the president’s ability to suspend the same. … Our system of separated powers demands no less.”Musk’s criticism reflects growing frustration among some conservatives and Trump allies over judicial interventions in executive actions. The court’s decision is one of several recent rulings blocking key elements of Trump’s policies since his return to office. Judges have also halted his administration’s freeze on federal grants and foreign aid, as well as efforts to give Elon Musk’s allies in the Department of Government Efficiency access to vast government databases containing sensitive financial and personal data.Whitehead’s ruling, issued after a hearing on a lawsuit brought by refugees and resettlement groups, temporarily halts the Department of Homeland Security from enforcing Trump’s order. Opponents of the directive argued that it left many would-be refugees stranded overseas after they had sold their belongings in preparation for their scheduled resettlement.“The defendant agencies’ implementation of the order likely violates bedrock principles of administrative law by vastly expanding the scope of the order with no reasoned explanation [and] no advance notice,” Whitehead stated.The Justice Department has indicated that it may appeal the ruling. Government attorney August Flentje urged Whitehead to pause his injunction while the administration considers its next steps, but the judge said he would rule on that request after issuing a formal written order.Musk’s post reignited debate over the judiciary’s role in reviewing executive actions. While critics argue that judicial intervention is necessary to check presidential overreach, Musk and others see it as an impediment to governance.The US Constitution grants courts the authority to block executive orders that violate the law or the Constitution, a fundamental aspect of the separation of powers. However, Musk’s comments align with Trump’s longstanding grievances against judicial interference, particularly when it comes to immigration policy .As Trump’s administration pushes forward with its agenda, legal battles over executive authority are likely to continue, with Musk emerging as one of the most vocal critics of judicial intervention in governance.","Elon Musk has criticised the US judiciary following a judge's decision to block President Donald Trump’s executive order pausing refugee admissions.

Indian-American politician Vivek Ramaswamy announced his run for governor of Ohio , with a bold proposal to introduce the same civic education for all in the state.He suggested that every high school senior in Ohio should pass the ""same civics test"" required for legal immigrants to become ""naturalised"" US citizens.He said that this will help students better understand American values and history, fostering a sense of pride and patriotism.""We need to teach our young people to be proud of our country and state, not ashamed of it,"" Ramaswamy said. ""They should learn what it means to be American and recite the pledge of allegiance. You can’t respect a country if you don’t know the basic things about it.""Ramaswamy, 39, first gained attention as a conservative critic of liberal corporate policies. He ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024 but dropped out after finishing fourth in the Iowa caucuses. Since then, he has strongly supported Donald Trump and his political agenda.Announcing his campaign, he said, ""I am honoured to announce my candidacy to serve as the next governor of the state of Ohio.""Ramaswamy also promised to make Ohio a leader in a ""second industrial revolution"" in the US.On Tuesday, President Donald Trump endorsed Ramaswamy, writing on Truth Social, “Vivek Ramaswamy is running for governor of Ohio. I know him well, and he is something special. He’s young, strong, and smart... He will be a great governor of Ohio and has my complete and total endorsement!”Elon Musk also showed his support on X, writing, “Good luck, you have my full endorsement!” Ramaswamy replied, “Thank you, Elon. Let’s roll!”Ramaswamy, who was Trump’s rival in the GOP’s 2024 presidential race, later joined his campaign team. Although he was nominated for an administration role overseeing DOGE alongside Musk, he chose to pursue his bid for Ohio governor instead.","Indian-American politician Vivek Ramaswamy announced his run for governor of Ohio.

Concerns over spending cuts and debt



Democratic opposition and public backlash



Republican divisions and senate dynamics



House Republicans have passed a budget resolution , a crucial step in advancing former President Donald Trump's economic agenda, which includes $4.5 trillion in tax breaks and $2 trillion in spending cuts . The GOP-controlled House approved the measure in a narrow 217-215 vote, overcoming opposition from Democrats and hesitation from some Republican lawmakers.House Speaker Mike Johnson, operating with a slim majority, worked to secure support amid resistance from Democrats and concerns among GOP members. Trump personally lobbied lawmakers, making calls to those on the fence and inviting Republicans to the White House to rally backing.“On a vote like this, you’re always going to have people you’re talking to all the way through the close of the vote,” Majority Leader Steve Scalise said ahead of the vote. “It’s that tight.”The budget resolution is designed to extend tax cuts secured during Trump’s first term, which are set to expire later this year, while also implementing significant reductions in federal spending . The next phase involves extensive committee hearings to draft specific legislation, followed by a Senate review. The Senate has already proposed a scaled-back version, and further negotiations are expected.Beyond the budget resolution, lawmakers face upcoming votes on unrelated spending matters, including a deal to prevent a government shutdown before the March 14 funding deadline.The proposal includes substantial cuts to federal programs, notably $880 billion from health care expenditures, including Medicaid, and $230 billion from agricultural programs such as food stamps. While GOP leaders argue the budget framework does not explicitly target Medicaid, some lawmakers sought assurances that critical social programs would not be slashed.Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., emphasized Trump's commitment to preserving Medicaid. “The president was clear about that. I was clear about that,” Lawler said. “We will work through this, but the objective today is to begin the process.”At the same time, fiscal conservatives worry that the budget might exacerbate the national debt, which stands at $36 trillion. The cost of extending tax breaks—estimated at $4.5 trillion over a decade—outweighs the proposed $2 trillion in spending cuts, raising concerns among deficit hawks.Democrats strongly oppose the measure, labeling it a “Republican rip-off” and a betrayal of American families. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries condemned the proposal, stating, “Our very way of life as a country is under assault.”Public criticism is also mounting as billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency implements mass layoffs across federal agencies, leading to voter unrest at town hall meetings.Despite the House’s approval, divisions remain within the GOP. Some Republican lawmakers, particularly those in the Congressional Hispanic Conference, have raised concerns about potential cuts to Medicaid, food stamps, and Pell Grants. Rep. Tony Gonzales, R-Texas, and other GOP members stressed the need to protect essential social programs while advancing Trump’s economic priorities.Senate Republicans have introduced a separate $340 billion package focusing on border security and deportation efforts, with plans to address tax cuts later in the year. Some GOP senators view the House’s approach as more comprehensive but acknowledge the challenges of securing final approval.“I’m holding my breath. I’m crossing my fingers,” said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas. “I think a one-shot is their best opportunity.”Johnson’s leadership faces increasing pressure as the GOP’s slim majority leaves little room for dissent. The budget resolution now moves into a lengthy process of committee deliberations and Senate negotiations. House Budget Committee Chairman Jodey Arrington argues that the economic projections underlying the proposal, which assume growth from 1.8% to 2.6%, would generate $2.6 trillion in savings over a decade and help reduce the deficit.However, some fiscal advocacy groups view these projections as overly optimistic, casting doubt on whether the plan will ultimately achieve its intended financial targets. As the debate unfolds, both parties are gearing up for a prolonged battle over spending priorities and economic policy.","The GOP-controlled House approved the measure in a narrow 217-215 vote.

The veteran host Jon Stewart took his signature outrage to a new level Tuesday night—literally drawing blood during an explosive segment on The Daily Show .Playing a mock employee of Elon Musk ’s Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ), Stewart brought out a calculator and a “World’s Most Dad” mug—a pointed jab at Musk’s ever-expanding family—before setting his sights on government waste. But when he turned his fury on Joe Biden’s modest prescription drug negotiations, things took a painful turn.“F—king thanks! Come on!” Stewart shouted, smashing the mug on his desk as a clip of Biden played onscreen. Moments later, he winced, hiding his hand under the desk before admitting, “I’ll be going to the hospital soon.”When he finally revealed his injury, the audience gasped at the sight of blood. “It’s fine!” he reassured them with a grin. Later, he promoted the episode as a “bloody good” one, quipping, “Emphasis on the bloody. I’m an idiot.”Beyond the theatrics, Stewart argued that DOGE was “cutting in the wrong places,” calling out corporate subsidies instead. “We’re getting f—cked at a Diddy party, and they’re making us buy the baby oil,” he cracked, referencing the embattled rapper’s legal troubles.He ended with an attempt at a MAGA-style slogan: Make America Not Governed In Obviously Negative—only to panic when he realized it spelled “MANGION,” one letter shy of UnitedHealthcare CEO shooter Luigi Mangione.“Oh! Abort, abort, abort,” he yelled, before urging action: “I’m kidding—no vigilantes. But do something!”","The veteran host took his signature outrage to a new level Tuesday night.

Confirmation of Death

Lying in State and Funeral Preparations

The Funeral Ceremony

The Period of Sede Vacante

The Conclave: Electing a New Pope

The White Smoke: A New Pope is Chosen

As Pope Francis, 88, remains critically ill in a Rome hospital due to a severe lung infection and other complications, Catholics around the world are preparing for what could be the end of his papacy. While his doctors have reported slight improvements, his age and medical history make his condition uncertain. If Pope Francis were to pass away, the Catholic Church would follow a centuries-old process designed to ensure an orderly transition of power. From the confirmation of his death to the election of a new pope, every step is carefully structured.When a pope dies, his death is officially confirmed by a Vatican doctor and the Camerlengo (Cardinal Chamberlain), who temporarily takes charge of the church’s administration. Historically, the Camerlengo would tap the pope’s forehead with a small silver hammer and call his name three times to ensure he was truly deceased. While this ritual is no longer followed, the Camerlengo still plays a crucial role. His immediate duties include securing the pope’s private apartments, destroying the Fisherman’s Ring to prevent forgery, and beginning the process of planning for the funeral and the election of a new pope.After death is confirmed, the pope’s body is dressed in traditional white papal garments and placed in a wooden coffin lined with zinc. In the past, popes were displayed for viewing in the Apostolic Palace, but Pope Francis has simplified this tradition. Instead, his body would be taken directly to St. Peter’s Basilica, where the public can pay their respects. The funeral takes place between four and six days after death. Unlike previous popes, who were buried in three nested coffins, Francis has decreed that he will be buried in a single wooden coffin lined with zinc. He has also requested burial in St. Mary Major Basilica rather than the traditional tombs in St. Peter’s Basilica.A special document, known as the rogito, summarizing the pope’s life and papacy, is placed inside the coffin along with coins minted during his time as pope. The coffin is closed the night before the funeral, and his face is covered with a white silk veil. The pope’s funeral is one of the most solemn and significant events in the Catholic Church, attended by world leaders, religious figures, and thousands of mourners. The funeral mass is traditionally led by the Dean of the College of Cardinals and takes place in St. Peter’s Square.From the moment the pope dies until a new one is elected, the Catholic Church enters a period called Sede Vacante (Latin for ""the seat is vacant""). During this time, the College of Cardinals oversees the Vatican but cannot make major decisions. The governance of the church is limited to essential functions, and preparations begin for the election of the next pope. This period lasts anywhere from 15 to 20 days, allowing cardinals from around the world to travel to Rome for the conclave.The election of a new pope takes place in a highly secretive gathering called the Conclave, which is held in the Sistine Chapel. Only cardinals under 80 years old can vote. The process follows strict rules to ensure fairness and prevent outside influence. Before voting begins, each cardinal swears an oath of secrecy. Multiple rounds of voting take place, and a candidate must receive a two-thirds majority to be elected. If no decision is reached, black smoke is released from a chimney above the Sistine Chapel, signaling to the public that the voting is still ongoing.Once a new pope is chosen, white smoke is released from the Sistine Chapel, signaling that a decision has been made. The newly elected pope is then asked whether he accepts the role. If he agrees, he chooses a new papal name and is dressed in white. He is then introduced to the world from the balcony of St. Peter’s Basilica, where a senior cardinal proclaims the famous words: “Habemus Papam”—“We have a pope.” This marks the official beginning of a new papacy and ensures the continuation of the Catholic Church's leadership.","Pope Francis, 88, remains critically ill in a Rome hospital due to a severe lung infection and other complications.

Watch: Donald Trump hands out ‘Trump was right about everything’ caps in the Oval Office,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/watch-donald-trump-hands-out-trump-was-right-about-everything-caps-in-the-oval-office/articleshow/118570794.cms,"President Donald Trump , never one to shy away from a branding opportunity, handed out red baseball caps labeled "" Trump was right about everything "" in the Oval Office . """"Give me all of them. Look, see that? Trump was right about everything. Just came in. Somebody said. I said, this was sent in by a fan. I said, I think we should make some of them right. But we were pretty much, you want one?"" Trump said, presenting the caps with the flair of a seasoned showman.He then teasingly singled out a journalist, questioning whether he was ""allowed"" to accept one. ""Are you allowed to take one? Because he'll consider it. I know him well. He's sort of a stiff. Brian, you're not a stiff. You're sort of a stiff guy. He'll take other things, but not a free hand. Always say yes to the president. Always say yes to the president. Would anybody like one?""Trump’s gesture comes amid growing tensions between his administration and the White House press corps. The White House recently announced it would take control of media access, stripping the White House Correspondents' Association (WHCA) of its long-held authority to decide which journalists cover presidential events. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that the move was necessary to end the WHCA’s “monopoly” and allow access to more outlets.The decision has sparked criticism, with WHCA President Eugene Daniels warning that it undermines press freedom . ""This move tears at the independence of a free press in the United States. It suggests the government will choose the journalists who cover the president,"" Daniels said. Fox News’ Jacqui Heinrich also questioned the decision, saying it gave power to the White House rather than the people.The changes come as Trump continues to feud with major media outlets. His administration recently barred the Associated Press from presidential events over a dispute regarding the naming of the Gulf of Mexico as the “Gulf of America.” Trump has called AP a “terrible” and “radical left” organisation, while standing by his decision to rebrand the body of water. ""I'm just admiring it as I look at it. I'm getting teary-eyed,"" he remarked during a briefing, gesturing toward a map labeled ""Gulf of America.""Trump has long had a contentious relationship with the media, frequently dismissing critical coverage as “fake news.” In a recent exchange aboard Air Force One, he mocked a HuffPost reporter who asked about a controversial remark by Vice President JD Vance. “I don’t know even what you’re talking about. Neither do you. Who are you with?” Trump quipped. Upon learning the reporter was from HuffPost, he responded, “Oh, no wonder. I thought they died. Are they still around? I haven’t read them in years. I thought they died.”","President Donald Trump handed out red baseball caps labeled "" Trump was right about everything "" in the Oval Office.

Apple to fix iPhone dictation bug that briefly typed 'Trump' instead of 'racist',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/apple-to-fix-iphone-dictation-bug-that-briefly-types-trump-instead-of-racist/articleshow/118570275.cms,"Apple is addressing a peculiar glitch in its automatic dictation feature after some iPhone users reported that the word “racist” momentarily appeared as “Trump” before correcting itself. The issue, which sparked controversy after a viral TikTok post, has led to accusations of political bias against the tech giant.The problem was replicated multiple times and appeared to stem from phonetic similarities between the two words, according to an Apple spokesperson. “We are aware of an issue with the speech recognition model that powers Dictation and we are rolling out a fix today,” the company said in a statement.Artificial intelligence expert John Burkey, a former member of Apple’s Siri team, suggested that the glitch might not have been purely technical. “This smells like a serious prank,” Burkey said. “The only question is: Did someone slip this into the data or slip into the code?” He noted that the issue arose after a server update but doubted that Apple’s AI training data was the root cause.The controversy follows Apple’s recent struggles with AI-powered features. Last month, the company disabled a key function of its Apple Intelligence system after it generated inaccurate news summaries. In 2018, Siri faced backlash when it briefly displayed a nude image in response to a question about Donald Trump, an issue linked to Wikipedia edits.The latest glitch surfaced shortly after Apple announced a $500 billion investment in the US over the next four years, including plans to manufacture AI servers at a new facility in Houston. The commitment came after Apple CEO Tim Cook met with President Donald Trump last week, reaffirming the company’s pledge to boost domestic investments.","Apple's automatic dictation feature appeared to mistake the word ""racist"" for ""Trump"" The company is rolling out a fix to fix the problem.

Recently, a directive was issued requiring employees to submit five bullet points summarising their weekly accomplishments or face potential job termination. While the Office of Personnel Management initially suggested compliance was voluntary, later guidance implied possible consequences for non-responsiveness.This approach mirrors Musk’s management tactics at his own companies, where he has pushed for high accountability and frequent performance evaluations. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt defended the policy, saying over a million federal employees had already complied and the administration was working as a ""unified team.""However, the policy has sparked confusion and resistance among government workers, with some fearing retaliation for non-compliance. Reports suggest that many employees were left uncertain about whether the requirement was mandatory, leading to mixed responses. One anonymous worker admitted submitting their report simply to avoid repercussions.Musk has been vocal on X about his stance, calling the request ""utterly trivial"" and criticising those who failed to comply. He also shared news of rising unemployment in Washington, posting, ""The DC swamp is actually draining.""The controversy surrounding Musk’s role in government operations extends beyond workforce policies. His company, SpaceX, is reportedly in the running to replace a $2 billion federal contract currently held by Verizon for modernising air traffic communications. Concerns have been raised about conflicts of interest, with some experts questioning Musk’s access to government decision-making processes. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has already begun testing Starlink terminals at its facilities, a move seen as a prelude to a potential contract shift.Musk’s influence within the Trump administration has drawn criticism from both Democrats and some Republicans, with polling indicating that a significant portion of Americans view his involvement in government as concerning. Despite this, his allies maintain that his presence is necessary to drive efficiency and accountability within federal operations.","The viral post, purportedly an email to HR, listed explicit details of personal activities in place of a standard work report.

Trump’s gold card visa scheme likely to impact Indians planning to apply for green cards through EB-5 route,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-gold-card-visa-scheme-likely-to-impact-indians-planning-to-apply-for-green-cards-through-eb-5-route/articleshow/118569497.cms,".

(This story originally appeared in on Feb 26, 2025)

The announcement by US President Donald Trump on Tuesday on the launch of a gold card investor visa programme , for wealthy immigrants, is likely to impact many Indians who are looking at applying for US green cards or permanent residency through the EB-5 visa route .President Trump told reporters on Tuesday that the new gold card scheme, which would replace the current EB-5 visa programme, would cost around $5 million dollars per applicant.“We’re going to be selling a gold card. You have a green card. This is a gold card,” the US President told reporters in his Oval Office. He described the new programme as ‘green card privileges plus’ that would offer recipients a route to citizenship in the US and added that he had previewed the programme as ready to launch in two weeks.“They’ll be wealthy and they’ll be successful, and they’ll be spending a lot of money and paying a lot of taxes and employing a lot of people, and we think it’s going to be extremely successful,” President Trump said about the gold card programme.In a related announcement, US secretary of commerce Howard Lutnick, who addressed reporters along with the president, said the gold card programme would replace the current EB-5 visa programme.Ajay Bhutoria, a Silicon Valley based Democrat and advocate for immigration reform, has raised concerns over President Trump’s new ‘gold card’ proposal. “I’ve spent years pushing for immigration reforms that bring fairness and opportunity to the millions of talented, skilled individuals caught in the green card backlog—people who have played by the rules, contributed to our economy, and waited decades for a chance at stability. So, when I hear about these $5 million ‘gold cards’—a new path to citizenship for wealthy foreigners who can pay to create jobs—it raises serious concerns for me,” he said.He described the announcement as a pay-to-play scheme that sidelines the people who have been the backbone of the US workforce and communities. “The idea that you can buy your way into a green card and citizenship for $5 million, while millions of skilled workers—engineers, doctors, tech experts—languish in a backlog that stretches over 50 years for some, especially from countries like India, is a slap in the face. These are individuals who have already proven their worth, paying taxes, driving innovation, and building lives here. They won’t benefit from this. Instead, we are rolling out a red carpet for the ultra-wealthy, no backlog is required, just a fat check. That’s not sophistication—it is elitism dressed up as policy,” Bhutoria said.He also added that replacing the EB-5 programme, which at least had a framework for job creation, with the ‘Trump gold card’ felt like a step backward. “It’s not about building a merit-based system—it’s about who can afford the entry fee. We need solutions that clear the backlog, support families, and strengthen our economy inclusively, not auction off citizenship to the highest bidder,” Bhutoria said.The EB-5, or employment-based fifth preference category, visa is an immigrant investor programme administered by the US Citizenship and Immigration Services. It provides a path for eligible investors to get US green cards by investing in new commercial enterprises in the US and creating at least 10 new, full-time jobs for Americans. The minimum investment requirement to qualify under the EB-5 programme is $1,050,000 or $800,000 if the investment is made in a qualifying infrastructure project or targeted employment area. EB-5 applicants have the choice of investing directly or through a larger investor pool via regional centres which are approved by the USCIS.",US President Donald Trump on Tuesday on the launch of a gold card investor visa programme.

Zelenskyy to visit US for economic pact amid Donald Trump’s pressure on Ukraine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/zelenskyy-to-visit-us-for-economic-pact-amid-donald-trumps-pressure-on-ukraine/articleshow/118569365.cms,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is expected to visit Washington on Friday to finalize an economic partnership with the United States, potentially securing American investment in Ukraine’s rare earth minerals sector as part of a postwar agreement.Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, President Donald Trump said, “I hear that he’s coming on Friday. Certainly, it’s okay with me if he’d like to. He would like to sign it together with me.” He described the deal as a “very big deal.”A senior administration official, while cautioning that plans remain fluid, indicated that Zelenskyy’s visit was likely given the current diplomatic posture. The agreement reportedly involves granting the US significant stakes in Ukraine’s rare earth minerals industry, a key sector in global technology and defense production.Trump has recently escalated pressure on Zelenskyy, labelling him a “dictator” and blaming Ukraine for the war that Russia initiated in 2022. His administration initially proposed that Ukraine allocate $500 billion in future revenue to the US as de facto reparations for the military and humanitarian aid it has received. Zelenskyy rejected that offer but has continued negotiations to reach a modified deal.“We’re saying, look… we want to get that money back,” Trump said on Tuesday, again overstating the total US aid sent to Ukraine, which stands at approximately $120 billion since the war began. He falsely claimed the US had provided $350 billion in aid and that European support for Ukraine was structured as a loan, a claim widely disputed.Some of Trump’s allies, including Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), have suggested that US economic involvement in Ukraine’s mineral sector would serve as a form of security guarantee, as Washington would have a vested interest in protecting its investments. However, Trump has signaled that Europe, rather than the US, should be primarily responsible for Ukraine’s military security in the future.","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is expected to visit Washington on Friday to finalize an economic partnership with the United States.

String of aviation disasters raises alarm

January 2024: A US Army helicopter collided with an American Airlines plane near Washington, DC, killing 67 people.

February 2024: A medical jet plummeted into a Philadelphia street, exploding on impact and killing seven.

Last week: A Delta flight crash-landed in Toronto, flipping upside down and bursting into flames.

A terrifying near-miss at Chicago Midway Airport on Tuesday morning saw a Southwest Airlines plane come within moments of disaster, forced to abort landing at the last second as a private jet rolled across its path without authorization.Southwest Flight 2504 , a Boeing 737 inbound from Omaha, Nebraska, was mere feet from touching down when the private Challenger 350 suddenly moved onto the runway, creating a potentially catastrophic scenario.Shocking footage captured the moment the Southwest pilots had to react instantly—yanking the plane back into the air just before impact. Passengers onboard felt the engines surge as the aircraft climbed sharply to avoid a deadly crash.“The crew followed safety procedures, and the flight landed without incident,” Southwest Airlines later confirmed, though the dramatic moment left many shaken.The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has launched an investigation into the unauthorized movement of the private jet, which departed for Knoxville, Tennessee, shortly after the incident. Officials are examining whether pilot error, miscommunication, or an air traffic control oversight led to the close call.While no injuries were reported, aviation experts say the event underscores growing concerns about runway safety and near-collisions at major airports.This near-disaster comes amid a wave of aviation tragedies making headlines in recent weeks:As federal investigators piece together what went wrong in Chicago, one thing is clear—the margin for error in the skies is razor-thin.","A Southwest Airlines plane was forced to abort landing at Chicago Midway Airport on Tuesday morning.

'On the train or in front of it'

Democrats fight back: ‘Way of life under assault’

The GOP’s balancing act

Senate GOP’s backup plan

Johnson’s high-stakes gamble

Against fierce opposition from Democrats—and even resistance within his own party—House Speaker Mike Johnson is making a high-stakes push to pass a Republican budget blueprint that would extend Donald Trump’s sweeping tax breaks while slashing federal spending. With votes hanging in the balance Tuesday evening, Johnson faces an uphill battle to deliver on what Trump has called his “big, beautiful bill.”With razor-thin control of the House, Johnson is in damage control mode, working feverishly to keep his caucus together. GOP leaders insist the bill is a crucial step in Trump’s plan to overhaul government spending, promising $4.5 trillion in tax breaks while cutting $2 trillion from federal programs. But with tensions running high, even some Republicans are balking at the scale of the cuts.“There may be a vote tonight, there may not be,” Johnson admitted after a closed-door meeting at the Capitol. Despite the uncertainty, he remains confident. “Everybody wants to be on this train, and not in front of it.”Johnson is working to reassure GOP lawmakers that the bill’s details will be ironed out in the coming weeks. In a show of force, Trump has summoned key Republicans to the White House to rally support.House Democrats are vowing to block the bill, decrying it as a massive giveaway to the wealthy at the expense of working Americans. Standing on the Capitol steps flanked by constituents, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries condemned the plan.“Our very way of life as a country is under assault,” Jeffries declared. “House Democrats will not provide a single vote to this reckless Republican budget—not one.”At the heart of the fight is the proposed $880 billion cut to the committee overseeing health care programs, including Medicaid, and a $230 billion reduction to the agriculture committee that funds food stamps. Many Republican lawmakers, particularly those in competitive districts, worry the cuts will backfire politically.Republicans find themselves in a familiar dilemma: championing spending cuts in theory but struggling to enact them without alienating their constituents. Johnson insists Medicaid isn’t explicitly targeted in the bill’s framework, but some lawmakers demand concrete protections.“The president was clear about that. I was clear about that,” said Rep. Mike Lawler (R-N.Y.), emphasizing Trump’s commitment to shielding Medicaid. “We will work through this, but the objective today is to begin the process.”Meanwhile, fiscal conservatives are withholding support, arguing the bill doesn’t do enough to reduce the national debt, which has now surpassed $36 trillion.“I’m not voting for that,” said Rep. Warren Davidson (R-Ohio), citing concerns that the tax cuts far outweigh spending reductions.Skeptical that Johnson can deliver, Senate Republicans have floated a more modest $340 billion package, prioritizing funding for Trump’s deportation and border security agenda while delaying tax cut negotiations. Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) is rooting for Johnson’s broader package but is keeping expectations in check.“I’m holding my breath. I’m crossing my fingers,” Cornyn said. “I think a one-shot is their best opportunity.”With one of the slimmest majorities in modern history, Johnson has little margin for error. House leaders are trying to convince members that this is just a first step, not the final product.Budget Committee Chairman Jodey Arrington (R-Texas) acknowledged the competing pressures between deficit hawks and moderates in swing districts.“Some members have a higher level of sensitivity to spending reforms,” Arrington said.Still, he argues that the Republican growth projections—assuming a rise from 1.8% to 2.6% in economic expansion—would generate $2.6 trillion in savings over a decade.With Democrats determined to block the bill and Republicans divided over its scope, Johnson faces a defining test of his leadership. The fate of Trump’s ambitious tax and spending plan now hangs in the balance as Washington braces for a battle that could reshape the country’s fiscal future.","House Speaker Mike Johnson is in damage control mode, working feverishly to keep his caucus together.

New York City is terminating a $220m deal with the Pakistan-owned Roosevelt Hotel to house a migrant shelter following a prolonged MAGA meltdown over use of American taxpayer money to facilitate immigration to the US.Under pressure from the federal government and MAGA hardliners, Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat who gravitated to the Trump orbit after facing corruption charges from the Biden administration, announced closure of the site that is said to have housed tens of thousands of migrants in its 1025 rooms at $ 200 a night.The site opened in May 2023 to serve as both a new arrivals center and shelter for asylum seekers under a three-year $ 220 million deal with government-run Pakistan International Airlines, which owns the hotel, having bought out a Saudi stake in it for $ 36.4million in 2005.At peak traffic in 2023 when around 4000 migrants were arriving in the city each week, the sight of asylum seekers camping outside the hotel waiting to be processed triggered MAGA hardliners and even some New Yorkers, as Trump and his supporters complained about Democrats housing ""illegal immigrants"" in ""luxury hotels"" at the expense of US taxpayers.""A taxpayer-funded hotel for illegal migrants is owned by the Pakistani government, which means NYC taxpayers are effectively paying a foreign government to house illegals in our own country.

The technical team will mainly engage with key ministries, including planning, finance, climate change, petroleum, water resources, the Federal Board of Revenue, disaster management agencies, and provincial governments.Without going into specifics, the IMF resident representative in Islamabad, Mahir Binici, confirmed the engagements spanning over three weeks from now.""An IMF staff team is scheduled to visit Pakistan in early to mid-March for discussions around the first review under Pakistan's Extended Fund Facility-supported programme and the authorities' request for assistance under a Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) arrangement. In this regard, a technical team will be in Pakistan starting in late February to discuss technical issues related to a possible RSF arrangement,"" he said.Official sources said the relevant authorities, particularly the ministries of planning and finance, had prepared documentation for the Climate-Related Public Investment Management Assessment (C-PIMA) for coming budgets in line with policy advice of the IMF and the World Bank.Talking about the first biannual review of the 39-month EFF, the sources said Pakistan had completed all but one structural benchmark as of now. However, Pakistan missed several indicative targets given the changing domestic and international macroeconomic conditions.The only outstanding benchmark pertains to the required amendments to the Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF) by the end of December. However, other sub-conditions of these entities regarding governance structure and financial safeguards have already been met.The funding under RSF is made available to nations who commit high-quality reforms to build resilience against climate catastrophes through adaptation and is repayable over 30 years, including a 10-year grace period and is normally cheaper than EFF terms.In October last year, Pakistan formally requested the IMF to top up its USD 7 billion EFF with another USD 1.2 billion RSF.The Fund had already advised Pakistan to invest 1 per cent of GDP per year (over Rs 1.24 trillion at the current year's estimate) in climate resilience and adaptation reforms to be ready to fight repeated and increasing cycles of extreme weather conditions, particularly floods and sustain economic growth and reverse inequalities.Such an investment in climate-adaptive infrastructure can reduce the negative growth impact of a natural disaster shock by one-third while ensuring a quicker and more complete recovery, the IMF suggested.The IMF noted that about 1 per cent of GDP investment in adaptation infrastructure would increase Pakistan's climate resilience and buffer climate shocks.These investments would reduce the growth impact of a natural disaster shock by about a third and return Pakistan to its previous GDP level more quickly.According to the IMF, Pakistan's living standards have been declining for decades, and despite a similar starting point in the early 1980s, Pakistanis' incomes had stagnated and fallen behind regional peers.At the same time, poverty rates remained elevated, and social development indicators also lagged behind those of peers.This had been accompanied by weak human capital outcomes, low fiscal capacity, protection for favoured industries, and a large state footprint. Contributions to growth from human capital and efficiency gains were low, and health and education indicators, while improving in recent years, still lag behind regional and lower-middle-income peers. Human capital spending as a share of GDP has steadily declined.The consequences of these structural weaknesses have been exacerbated by increasingly high climate vulnerability.""Pakistan's climate faces a rate of warming significantly higher than the global average. This will bring increasingly greater climate variability and extreme events, including reduced water availability, more severe and longer droughts, accelerated glacial melt, more variable and intense monsoons accompanied by floods and landslides, and sea-level rise encroaching on coastal settlements and infrastructure,"" it said.The negative macroeconomic consequences of such a shift have already been felt. Climate and weather-related disasters, which have increasingly been exacerbated by climate change, resulted in USD 29.3 billion in economic losses over 1992-2021, equivalent to 11.1 per cent of 2020 GDP, which slowed developmental gains.More recently, the floods of 2022 killed 1,700 people, displaced eight million, increased the poverty rate by up to four percentage points, and brought economic losses equivalent to 4.8 per cent of FY22 GDP, with reconstruction needs estimated at 1.6 times the budgeted national development expenditure of FY23.The disaster was exacerbated by Pakistan's weak urban planning, infrastructure and water resource management, according to Dawn.","Pakistan had requested USD 1 billion to address the impact of climate change. The technical team will mainly engage with key ministries, including planning, finance, climate change, petroleum, water resources, the Federal Board of Revenue, disaster management agencies, and provincial governments.

"No passengers, no planes: China-funded $240m Gwadar airport sits idle",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/no-passengers-no-planes-china-funded-240m-gwadar-airport-sits-idle/articleshow/118512631.cms,"Gwadar airport in Pakistan (Pic credit: AP)

With no passengers and no planes, Pakistan's newest and most expensive airport is a bit of a mystery. Entirely financed by China to the tune of $240 million, it's anyone's guess when New Gwadar International Airport will open for business. Located in the coastal city of Gwadar and completed in Oct 2024, its a stark contrast to the impoverished, restive southwestern Balochistan province around it.For the past decade, China has poured money into Balochistan and Gwadar as part of a multibillion dollar project that connects its western Xinjiang province with Arabian Sea, called the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor or CPEC.Authorities have hailed it as transformational but there's scant evidence of change in Gwadar. The city isn't connected to the national grid - electricity comes from Iran or solar panels - and there isn't enough clean water. An airport with a 400,000 passenger capacity isn't a priority for the city's 90,000 people.""This airport is not for Pakistan or Gwadar,"" said Azeem Khalid, an international relations expert who specialises in Pakistan-China ties. ""It is for China, so they can have secure access for their citizens to Gwadar and Balochistan.""CPEC has catalysed a decadeslong insurgency in resource-rich and strategically located Balochistan. Separatists, aggrieved by what they say is state exploitation at the expense of locals, are fighting for independence - targeting Pakistani troops and Chinese workers in the province and elsewhere. Members of Pakistan's ethnic Baloch minority say they face discrimination by govt and are denied opportunities available elsewhere in the country, charges govt denies.Pakistan, keen to protect China's investments, has stepped up its military footprint in Gwadar to combat dissent. The city is a jumble of checkpoints, barbed wire, troops, barricades, and watchtowers. Roads close at any given time, several days a week, to permit the safe passage of Chinese workers and Pakistani VIPs.Intelligence officers monitor journalists visiting Gwadar. Its fish market is deemed too sensitive for coverage.Many locals are frazzled. ""Nobody used to ask where we are going, what we are doing, and what is your name,"" said Khuda Bakhsh Hashim, 76. ""We used to enjoy all-night picnics in the mountains or rural areas. We are residents. Those who ask should identify themselves as to who they are.""Hashim recalled when Gwadar was part of Oman, not Pakistan, and was a stop for passenger ships heading to Mumbai. People didn't go hungry and found work easily, he said.But Gwadar's water has dried up because of drought and unchecked exploitation. So has the work. Govt says CPEC has created some 2,000 local jobs but it's not clear whom they mean by ""local"" - Baloch residents or Pakistanis from elsewhere in the country. Authorities did not elaborate.There is a perception Gwadar is dangerous or difficult to visit - only one commercial route operates out of its domestic airport, three times a week to Karachi, Pakistan's largest city. There are no direct flights to Balochistan's provincial capital of Quetta, or national capital of Islamabad.Security concerns delayed the inauguration of the international airport. There were fears the area's mountains - and their proximity to the airport - could be the ideal launchpad for an attack. Instead, PM Shehbaz Sharif and his Chinese counterpart Li Qiang hosted a virtual ceremony. The inaugural flight was off limits to media and public.","Gwadar is Pakistan's newest and most expensive airport. Entirely financed by China to the tune of $240 million.

ISLAMABAD: A mob enraged by a local’s murder over a trivial parking dispute snatched the suspect, a watchman, from police and lynched him in the mountainous Galiyat region of Pakistan's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Sunday. Several police officers were wounded in the violence in a neighbourhood under the jurisdiction of Changla Gali police station, around 80km from Islamabad.Police said Imran Abbasi, a local, had parked his car in the designated area of a housing society and left for home. When he returned the next day, he got into a fight with the watchman, Khan Zaman, who allegedly stabbed him to death and wounded his brother.As word spread about the murder, a mob milled in the area and burned down five houses in the residential society.Police apprehended the culprit, who was hiding in the basement of a building, and were about to take him away when the mob swooped on him and beat him to death with sticks and stones.Lynchings are common in Pakistan and several instances of mob violence have taken place in the past decade. Many people have been lynched for alleged blasphemy, while mobs have also murdered suspects in street crimes.In June 2024, a suspected robber was lynched by a mob in the southern port city of Karachi. The suspect, armed with a pistol, had attempted to rob a citizen, who put up resistance and was joined by others standing nearby. The mob got hold of the suspect and hit him with blunt weapons, resulting in his death on the spot.In May 2024, another mob lynched a suspected robber in Karachi's Orangi town while police saved his accomplice from being killed.The same month, police rescued a Christian man from angry people, who wanted to lynch him and attacked the homes of other minority members in Punjab’s Sargodha district on charges of alleged blasphemy. Workers at a Sialkot garment factory tortured and burned to death their Sri Lankan general manager in 2023 for alleged blasphemy.","Imran Abbasi, a local, had parked his car in the designated area of a housing society and left for home.

Militancy in Balochistan



Airport inauguration delayed due to security concerns



Pakistan’s newest airport in Gwadar, fully funded by China at a cost of $240 million, remains unused months after its completion in October 2024.Spread over 4,300 acres of land. the airport is Pakistan's largest international airport and was officially opened on January 20 this year. Work started on Gwadar airport in 2019.The Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) PK 503 aircraft was the first commercial flight to arrive at the new airport after its inauguration carrying commercial passengers and high-ranking officials.However, the airport, designed to handle 400,000 passengers annually, has no scheduled flights.The New Gwadar International Airport is part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ), a multi-billion dollar project aimed at linking China’s Xinjiang province with the Arabian Sea. While officials have called it a major development, many in Gwadar say they see little benefit.Gwadar, located in Pakistan's Balochistan province , lacks basic infrastructure such as a stable electricity supply and clean water.""This airport is not for Pakistan or Gwadar,"" Azeem Khalid, an expert in Pakistan-China relations was quoted as saying by the news agency Associated Press (AP). ""It is for China, so they can have secure access for their citizens to Gwadar and Balochistan.""The airport’s construction comes amid ongoing security challenges in Balochistan. Separatist groups in the province oppose what they call exploitation of local resources, targeting both Pakistani security forces and Chinese workers.Pakistan has increased its military presence in Gwadar to protect Chinese investments, leading to more checkpoints and restrictions on movement. Roads are often closed to ensure the safety of Chinese workers and high-ranking officials.""Nobody used to ask where we are going, what we are doing, and what is your name,"" 76-year-old Gwadar resident Khuda Bakhsh Hashim was quoted as saying by the AP. ""We are asked to prove our identity, who we are, where we have come from. We are residents. Those who ask should identify themselves as to who they are.""Authorities claim CPEC has created 2,000 jobs, but there is no clarity on whether these positions were given to local Baloch residents or people from other parts of Pakistan.Gwadar remains largely disconnected, with only one commercial flight route operating three times a week to Karachi. There are no direct flights to Quetta, the provincial capital, or Islamabad.Militancy in Balochistan has increased in recent years, with attacks rising after 2021. Groups such as the Baloch Liberation Army have carried out multiple attacks, particularly after the Pakistani Taliban ended a ceasefire in 2022.Earlier, the airport’s opening was postponed due to security risks. Authorities feared that nearby mountains could be used to launch attacks. Instead, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Chinese Premier Li Qiang held a virtual inauguration. The first flight landed without media or public presence.Abdul Ghafoor Hoth, a local leader from the Balochistan Awami Party, said no local residents were hired to work at the airport.""Not a single resident of Gwadar was hired to work at the airport, not even as a watchman,"" he was quoted by AP.Hoth had led protests in December demanding better living conditions in Gwadar. The demonstrations lasted 47 days before authorities promised to address local concerns, including improved access to water and electricity. Since then, no progress has been made on these commitments.","Gwadar airport is Pakistan's largest international airport and was officially opened on January 20 this year.

For several weeks, any visits by family members, doctors, or lawyers were blocked. They want to break me through this torture and hardship, but I will stand firm for the genuine freedom of the Pakistnation.""Under the constitutional amendment, the term for the chief justice of Pakistan has been set at three years.

"Asmongold blasts Twitch over gambling ads, calling out streamers for what he sees as hypocrisy",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us-streamers/asmongold-blasts-twitch-over-gambling-ads-calling-out-streamers-for-what-he-sees-as-hypocrisy/articleshow/126028442.cms,"Asmongold criticized Twitch for allowing gambling-related ads to run during streams while creators publicly condemn gambling content. He argued that running ads makes streamers complicit, calling the debate “over” and accusing the platform of hypocrisy. With sports betting and fantasy ads still allowed, Asmongold says Twitch and its creators can no longer claim a moral high ground.

Why Asmongold says the gambling debate on Twitch is already over





Asmongold has reignited the long-running debate over gambling on Twitch, this time turning his frustration toward both the platform and fellow creators. The veteran streamer criticized Twitch for allowing gambling-related advertisements to appear during streams, despite its public stance against certain gambling content.While Twitch banned streams tied to unregulated casino sites in 2022, Asmongold argues the platform’s continued promotion of sports betting and fantasy sports exposes a contradiction that undercuts years of moral outrage from creators. In his view, the issue is no longer about policy nuances but about honesty. If gambling ads are running, he believes the platform and streamers who enable ads, are already complicit, whether they admit it or not.Asmongold didn’t mince words when addressing the situation on stream. “Right now, if you’re streaming on Twitch and you’re running ads, you are supporting gambling, period,” he said. “I don’t want to hear anymore or anybody ever virtue signal about gambling again. It’s over. Gambling has won. No more high roads.”He went even further, adding, “I never want to hear anybody streaming on Twitch, ever again, talking about how bad gambling is, or complaining about gambling.Saying Rainbet or Stake are bad. Uh-huh, it’s over. It’s done. Gambling is here, and it’s here to stay.”The comments come amid renewed scrutiny of Twitch’s advertising ecosystem. While the platform prohibits creators from streaming slots and casino games from unregulated websites, it still permits sports betting, poker, blackjack, and fantasy sports, the same categories now appearing in widespread in-stream ads. That distinction, according to Asmongold, makes public condemnations of gambling feel performative rather than principled.Ironically, Asmongold himself streams primarily on Kick, a platform backed by Stake, one of the gambling sites Twitch bans from creator partnerships. He has never branded himself as a gambling streamer, but his move to Kick adds complexity to his critique and underscores how deeply gambling money is embedded across streaming platforms.Ultimately, Asmongold’s message isn’t a call for stricter bans, it’s a demand for consistency. In his eyes, Twitch and its creators can’t claim the moral high ground while profiting from gambling-ad dollars, and pretending otherwise only fuels cynicism among viewers already skeptical of platform ethics.Also Read: “You’re a vulture”: Tomi Lahren explodes at Candace Owens and warns Erika Kirk against giving conspiracies more oxygen","Asmongold criticized Twitch for allowing gambling-related ads to run during streams.

Erika Kirk’s Fiery Warning Sparks Candace Owens' Clapback — Inside The 'Conspiracy' War

Erika Kirk calls meeting with Candace Owens “very productive”





Erika Kirk has offered a rare public assessment of her long-awaited sit-down with Candace Owens, calling the meeting “very productive” despite months of tension fueled by conspiracy theories surrounding her husband’s killing. Since conservative activist Charlie Kirk was fatally shot in September, Owens, once considered a close ally, had promoted unsubstantiated claims that questioned the official narrative of his death.Those theories deeply angered Kirk’s widow, who has since taken over leadership of Turning Point USA and publicly urged Owens to stop. Their private, hours-long conversation now marks a fragile attempt to reset a relationship strained by grief, mistrust, and public scrutiny.Following the four-and-a-half-hour meeting, Kirk shared a brief message on X, writing, “Had a very productive conversation with [Owens]. More to come from both of us.” Owens echoed the sentiment, saying, “We agreed much more than I had anticipated. Of course, we also disagreed on various points and people as well. Most importantly, we were able to share intel and clarify intent.”The meeting came after Owens repeatedly speculated that forces beyond the accused gunman were involved in Kirk’s assassination, including claims implicating foreign governments and even Turning Point USA associates.Law enforcement, however, maintains that Tyler Robinson acted alone. Prosecutors allege Robinson shot Kirk during an outdoor event at Utah Valley University and later texted his roommate, “I had enough of [Kirk’s] hatred. Some hate can’t be negotiated out.”Despite acknowledging the official account during her podcast, Owens continued to express doubt. “I said one of the reasons why I really want to sit down is because I want to walk out of here and feel confident saying to my audience, ‘Hey, there's stuff going on behind the scenes, but Tyler Robinson shot Charlie Kirk,’” she said. Yet Owens added that a conversation with Turning Point’s lawyer left her unconvinced, stating, “I don't believe that Tyler Robinson pulled the trigger. ”For Erika Kirk, the meeting appears less about agreement and more about containment. With Turning Point USA under intense pressure and legal proceedings ahead, her willingness to engage Owens signals an effort to prevent further damage, even as fundamental disagreements over Charlie Kirk’s death remain firmly unresolved.Also Read: Candace Owens accuses Erika Kirk of evading answers as ‘Egyptian plane’ theory resurfaces in Charlie Kirk murder case","Erika Kirk met privately with Candace Owens after months of frustration over conspiracy claims surrounding Charlie Kirk’s assassination.

Megyn Kelly explains how she helped Erika Kirk and Candace Owens talk face to face





Megyn Kelly has finally explained what she was doing behind the scenes as tensions grew between Candace Owens and Erika Kirk. As the public fight got louder, many viewers questioned why Kelly stayed mostly silent. On her show, The Megyn Kelly Show, Kelly said her silence was not avoidance. Instead, she was working quietly to help both sides talk. Kelly made it clear she wanted facts to come first, not rumors. She also pushed back on claims that Candace Owens accused Erika Kirk of planning Charlie Kirk ’s murder.Megyn Kelly said that claim was not true at the time and she corrected it publicly when asked. Her goal, she explained, was simple: stop false claims, protect people who are grieving, and help reduce the damage caused by public attacks.According to Kelly, this effort led to a long, private meeting between Candace Owens and Erika Kirk that helped calm things down.Megyn Kelly said the situation started when Ben Shapiro told her that Candace Owens had accused Erika Kirk of being behind Charlie Kirk’s murder. Kelly said she was shocked and had her team check the facts. After reviewing Candace’s past statements, Kelly said clearly, “That’s actually not true.”She explained that while Candace criticized Turning Point USA, Erika Kirk was not its CEO at the time of Charlie Kirk’s death. Kelly stressed that facts matter and said, “We are relentlessly factual here in this program.”As the conflict grew, Erika Kirk spoke publicly on Fox News with Harris Faulkner and later on CBS News with Bari Weiss. During that CBS town hall, Erika Kirk directly addressed Candace Owens. When asked what she wanted to say, Erika replied, “Stop. That’s it. That’s all I have to say. Stop.”Candace Owens responded by saying she was not lying and believed she was investigating Charlie Kirk’s murder. Megyn Kelly disagreed. She said, “I think they have the true killer of Charlie Kirk in custody. His name is Tyler Robinson.” Kelly added that while others are free to believe different theories, she does not share those views.Megyn Kelly also spoke openly about her personal feelings. She said she cares deeply about Erika Kirk and understands she is grieving. At the same time, she said Candace Owens has the right to criticize media actions without being accused of something she did not say.The turning point came on Monday, when Erika Kirk and Candace Owens met in Nashville for four and a half hours. After the meeting, Candace posted on X, “Erika and I had an extremely productive 4 1/2 hour meeting… tensions were thawed.” Erika shared a similar message, calling it a “very productive conversation.”Megyn Kelly then revealed her role. She said Erika Kirk called her weeks earlier and asked her to help set up the meeting. Kelly agreed and contacted Candace Owens, who replied, “Absolutely, I’m thrilled it’s you. I’m in.” While the meeting ended up being private, Kelly said she supported that choice fully.Megyn Kelly closed with a blunt message to critics attacking her online. She said they had no idea what was happening behind the scenes and added that real conversations matter more than online fights.Also Read: John Crist Reveals Public Drama Hides Private Friendships Between Candace Owens, Tucker Carlson And TPUSA","Megyn Kelly has finally explained what she was doing behind the scenes as tensions grew between Candace Owens and Erika Kirk.

John Crist describes private interactions involving Candace Owens, Tucker Carlson, Marjorie Taylor Greene, and Turning Point USA





Comedian John Crist has sparked fresh debate after saying that Candace Owens, Tucker Carlson, Marjorie Taylor Greene, and Turning Point USA staff are actually friendly with each other when cameras are off. His comments are now spreading again on social media. This comes at a tense time, as these same figures are publicly clashing over the death of Charlie Kirk , the founder of Turning Point USA.Charlie Kirk was assassinated on September 10, 2025, during a Turning Point USA event at Utah Valley University, according to official reports. Since then, the situation has grown more heated.Candace Owens has shared several theories about Kirk’s death and has claimed that some people inside Turning Point USA may be linked to what happened.Tucker Carlson has also said he does not trust the FBI investigation. Marjorie Taylor Greene has voiced support for parts of their concerns.In the middle of all this public fighting, John Crist’s comments suggest something very different is happening behind closed doors.John Crist spoke about this on the December 10 episode of the “Net Positive With John Crist” podcast after attending a recent Tucker Carlson event.He said everyone many people think are enemies were actually calm and friendly in person.Crist said:“And I was like, I go, all right, this is what, and this is what I always have thought about those kind of things, and I’ll just say it out loud for everybody, listening, and I’ve said this before in some kind of context. There was Turning Point people there. And Candace Owens was there. Marjorie Taylor, Tucker Carlson. I hate to say this out loud, out loud. Everybody friends. Everybody friends.”Crist then compared it to politics in Washington, saying public fights do not always match private behavior.He said:“And I’ve said that before, and I go, oh, I, and I think, I’ve heard before about Washington, DC. It’s like, we saw like the Democratic majority leader and like the Republican, they’re at dinner. I go, yeah, everybody friends. And everybody, like, kind of in, like, we would see, like, let’s say, like Theo’s, good buddy of ours, he would be, like, doing something. You were like, oh, yeah, they, it’s kind of just they, for the thing, for their job. ”Crist added that he was surprised, because he believed they would be openly fighting.Meanwhile, Candace Owens, in a November 12 YouTube video, claimed that Utah Valley University warned Turning Point USA about safety concerns before Kirk’s event.Owens said:“UVU recommended to Turning Point that they not hold the event in the amphitheatre because of safety reasons. ‘Not a good idea because we can’t shut this area down. It’s not a good idea because there’s no control here. We cannot control the flow of traffic coming in and out of this amphitheatre.’”She added:“But, Turning Point insisted that that was where they wanted to have the event. It was because Turning Point insisted, that the event wasn’t held outside. Now, I can tell you, having done these events, that was the first thing, among many, that struck me as odd, that anyone could just walk into…that’s the whole point of safety.”Candace Owens has also claimed that Charlie Kirk messaged a Turning Point USA member shortly before his death. These claims remain allegations, and no official agency has confirmed them.Also Read: What Really Happened Between Candace Owens And Erika Kirk?

Wedding bells soon? FBI director Kash Patel’s girlfriend Alexis Wilkins fuels engagement buzz online,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/wedding-bells-soon-fbi-director-kash-patels-girlfriend-alexis-wilkins-fuels-engagement-buzz-online/articleshow/125994978.cms,"Kash Patel Justifies Using FBI Aircraft To Visit Girlfriend Alexis Wilkins





It’s not every day that an FBI director finds himself at the centre of a social-media nudge toward matrimony — but Kash Patel ’s love life is suddenly trending almost as much as his job.Patel’s country-singer girlfriend, Alexis Wilkins , appears to be waging a very public, emoji-laced “propose already” campaign, amplifying hints, reposts and playful prods that suggest she’s ready for an engagement ring sooner rather than later.The online cheerleading comes at an awkward moment for the 45-year-old FBI chief, whose relationship with the 27-year-old aspiring musician has already drawn scrutiny over his alleged use of bureau perks to visit and protect her. Still, Patel has stood firmly by Wilkins — and she seems more than happy to stand right beside him, preferably with a ring involved.On Monday Wilkins shared an X post by right-wing activist Xaviaer DuRousseau praising Patel after news of foiled New Year’s Eve bomb plots in Los Angeles.DuRousseau wrote, “God bless you @FBIDirectorKash 🙏🏾 And please propose to my friend soon 😌” Wilkins responded, “Xaviaer over here with facts 😉” She later reposted his Instagram story, adding, “Ride or D1e KING over here 🫶 @xaviaer.”Katie Miller, wife of former Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, teased Patel and Wilkins’ appearance on her podcast, asking, “Where’s her ring?” with both Patel and Wilkins laughing in the clip.Patel defended their relationship in an X post, calling Wilkins “the woman I’m proud to call my partner in life,” and “a country music sensation who has done more for this nation than most will in ten lifetimes.”Insiders told MS Now that Patel twice ordered Wilkins’s security detail to drive a friend home and in one instance shouted at the team leader to comply. News of Patel’s use of $60 million in private jet services and the assignment of SWAT agents prompted national outcry.Rumours that Patel’s position is at risk have circulated, following criticism of his handling of cases including the Brown University mass shooting. White House Secretary Karoline Leavitt dismissed speculation that Patel would be dismissed, posting a photograph of Patel with President Donald Trump from November.","Kash Patel’s country-singer girlfriend, Alexis Wilkins, appears to be waging a very public, emoji-laced “propose already” campaign.

A forced pivot to Canada

Innovation versus immigration politics

Living with permanent uncertainty









For nearly a year, Delaram Pouyabahar planned her next academic step around a postdoctoral position at Harvard University. Interviews, fellowship applications, visa paperwork and a consular interview in Toronto were all completed. Then, in early June 2025, a new US travel ban quietly brought those plans to a halt.The policy, announced on June 4, expanded the scope of the 2017 travel ban to 19 countries, including Iran. Unlike the earlier ban, which still allowed many students and academic researchers to enter the US after delays or special approvals, the new rules removed those pathways altogether. According to Pouyabahar’s own public account, her visa process simply stalled after the ban took effect, leaving her unable to take up the Harvard postdoc she had spent months preparing for.Pouyabahar is not an obscure or early stage applicant. She is an Iranian born computational biologist specialising in machine learning methods for single cell RNA sequencing, a fast growing area at the intersection of AI and life sciences. One of her Nature journal papers has been cited more than 200 times, an unusually high figure for an early career researcher and a marker of broad influence within the field.Her work focuses on developing tools that help scientists interpret complex biological data, methods that are now used by research groups worldwide.In a global academic system that prizes measurable impact, citation counts and journal quality, her profile places her among the most competitive candidates for elite postdoctoral positions.The 2025 travel ban goes further than its 2017 predecessor. While the earlier policy eventually allowed exemptions for F and J visas covering students, postdoctoral researchers and visiting scholars, the new version offers no such carve outs. New entries from affected countries are blocked regardless of academic credentials or institutional sponsorship.Higher education associations and university immigration offices estimate that thousands of prospective students and scholars, potentially more than 10,000, could be affected by the policy. At institutions such as Harvard, administrators have warned that dozens of incoming researchers from banned countries may be unable to take up their positions.When draft versions of the ban appeared in media reports in March 2025, Pouyabahar attempted to accelerate her timeline. She rescheduled her PhD defence at short notice, preparing in just two weeks in the hope that an earlier completion date might protect her plans.Those efforts proved futile. The ban was announced only weeks after her visa interview, and she has said she never received a response. When she asked about the possibility of an exemption, she was told it was unlikely to help under the new policy framework.With the US option closed, Pouyabahar redirected her career to Canada, where she was already based and where immigration pathways for researchers remain more predictable. The move allowed her to continue her work, but it came at the cost of abandoning a carefully planned transition to one of the world’s most prestigious research environments.Her experience reflects a broader pattern among Iranian scholars affected by the ban. Many have quietly rerouted their careers to Canada or Europe, while others have delayed projects, lost funding opportunities or put academic plans on hold altogether.Economists and science policy researchers have consistently shown that high skilled immigrants play an outsized role in US innovation. Foreign born scientists account for a disproportionate share of patents, startups and breakthrough research, particularly in fields such as biotechnology and artificial intelligence.Critics argue that policies which exclude researchers like Pouyabahar undermine America’s scientific and economic competitiveness. Supporters of the ban frame it as a national security measure. What stands out, however, is how muted the political and public response has been compared with the airport protests and legal battles that followed the 2017 travel ban.Beyond the immediate career impact, Pouyabahar has described the psychological toll of the process, pointing to months of uncertainty over visa status, the risk of frozen grants and the constant fear of sudden policy changes.Reflecting on the outcome, she has said that in the current political climate she feels a sense of reluctant relief at not entering a system where immigration status can be overturned overnight.

Trump orders blockade of Venezuelan oil tankers: Oil prices jump; supply risks rise,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trump-orders-blockade-of-venezuelan-oil-tankers-oil-prices-jump-supply-risks-rise/articleshow/126029793.cms,"Venezuela EXPLODES: Pro-Maduro Rallies Sweep Caracas After Trump Seizes Oil Tanker | Watch

Oil prices rose sharply on Wednesday after US President Donald Trump ordered ""a total and complete"" blockade of all sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela, stoking fresh geopolitical tensions at a time when markets are already wary about weak global demand.Brent crude futures climbed 57 cents, or 0.9%, to $59.50 a barrel by 0135 GMT, while US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude gained 59 cents, or 1%, to $55.86 a barrel.The rebound came a day after oil prices settled near five-year lows, pressured by progress in Russia-Ukraine peace talks. A potential deal could lead to easing of Western sanctions on Moscow, increasing supply in an already well-supplied market.Earlier on Tuesday, Trump ordered a blockade of sanctioned oil tankers linked to Venezuela and said he now regarded the country’s rulers as a foreign terrorist organisation.The move could disrupt about 0.4–0.5 million barrels per day of supply and lift prices by $1–2 per barrel, according to a US oil trader.""In regard to pricing impacts, we should see the prompt physical premiums reacting more than flat price, especially natural Merey replacements in the Gulf Coast like Canadian and Colombian Castilla blends, though the total loss of supply would be less than 200,000 barrels per day for the Chevron equity cargoes,"" Matias Togni, analyst at oil market insights firm Next Barrel, told Reuters.Another analysts said that the oil market is currently well supplied, but warned that if the blockade remains in place for an extended period, crude prices could move higher.It remains unclear how the US will enforce the blockade or whether it will deploy the Coast Guard, as it did last week. In recent months, Washington has moved warships into the region.Trump’s latest move follows the US seizure of a sanctioned oil tanker off Venezuela’s coast last week, stepping up pressure on the government of President Nicolas Maduro, whom Trump has accused of allowing drugs to enter the US.Since the seizure, Venezuela’s crude exports have fallen sharply. While many tankers lifting oil from the country are under sanctions, others transporting Venezuelan crude, as well as oil from Iran and Russia, remain unsanctioned. Tankers chartered by Chevron are also shipping Venezuelan crude to the US under a prior authorisation from Washington.","Brent crude futures climbed 57 cents, or 0.9%, to $59.50 a barrel by 0135 GMT.

Republican senator Eric Schmitt took to social media to slam the Democratic states that are trying to block the Trump administration's H1-B crackdown.In a lengthy post on X, Schmitt described how each Blue state is using the visa programme for certain reasons and hence trying to block the GOP crackdown.The MAGA senator said: ""20 Democrat states are suing the Trump Administration to block its H-1B visa crackdown. These states claim they need H-1Bs to import skilled foreign workers. But let's take a look at how they're actually using these visas.""Schmitt first attacked Blue stronghold and Gavin Newsom's territory of California. He said that California's AG, Rob Bonta, accused the Trump administration of trying to ""shut out the skilled workers America depends on.""Schmitt said that California has been the site of some of the most ""egregious H-1B abuse.""He used the example of Southern California Edison: Hundreds of US tech workers were laid off and then forced to train their H-1B replacements just to receive their severance package.One laid-off American worker said: ""They told us they could replace one of us with three, four, or five Indian personnel and still save money. They said, we can get four Indian guys for cheaper than the price of you.""Eric then took aim at Democratic Tony Ever's Wisconsin. The Republican claimed that motorcycle manufacturer Harley Davidson, headquartered in Milwaukee, has been sued in federal court for partnering with Indian outsourcing firms to lay off Wisconsin IT workers and force them to train their H-1B replacements.Like other Blue strongholds, Eric said that multiple major companies in Connecticut have fired American tech workers in high numbers and forced them to train their H-1B replacements.Eric claimed that one laid-off American in Connecticut was forced to train 10 additional workers back in India via web conferencing.Schmitt said that Illinois is ""another plaintiff."" He claimed that Illinois' Democratic senator Dick Durbin has been pushing for H-1B reform for decades.The US workers who were fired in the state put American flags outside their cubicles in protest before they left.Eric said that New Jersey is ""home to Toys ""R"" Us, which brought in H-1B workers from India to shadow employees for weeks (even following them to the restroom) so the foreign workers could create manuals on how to do the jobs themselves. Then the Americans were laid off.""Eric said that Microsoft recently announced mass layoffs while applying for thousands of H-1B visas in the Blue stronghold.Schmitt claimed that Minnesota's largest employers have laid off hundreds of IT workers and outsourced them to India.

Bondi Beach shooting : 11 dead, shooters seized





As panic spread across Sydney’s Bondi Beach during a deadly shooting at a Hanukkah celebration, one man put his life on the line to stop the gunfire.His name is Ahmed al Ahmed, a 43-year-old fruit shop owner who is now being hailed as a hero for tackling and disarming one of the attackers. The heroic act was caught on camera and went viral following the shooting.Ahmed is a father of two from Sydney’s south. He was walking past the area when two gunmen opened fire near the Chanukah By The Sea, a Jewish celebration on Sunday. The gathering was held near a children’s playground and hundreds of families were there for the event.Footage online shows Ahmed, dressed in a white shirt, crouching behind parked cars as shots ring out. At the right moment, he rushed forward and grabbed one of the gunmen from behind, placing him in a headlock. After a violent struggle lasting several seconds, Ahmed wrestles the shotgun from the attacker, forcing him to retreat.In the video, Ahmed can later be seen sitting on the ground as bystanders rush to help him. A towel is brought to stop the bleeding from his leg. He was shot twice. Despite being wounded, he remains conscious and places the seized weapon against a tree.His cousin, Mustafa, spoke to 7News and said Ahmed was undergoing treatment in the hospital.“He’s in hospital and we don’t know exactly what’s going on inside,” Mustafa said. “We do hope he will be fine. He’s a hero 100 per cent.”Ahmed was reportedly due to undergo surgery and had no prior experience handling firearms. According to family members, he acted out of instinct to protect others.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised the heroic act, describing it as “the pinnacle of Jewish heroism”.Police said two shooters were involved in the attack. One was shot dead at the scene, while the other was critically injured and taken into custody.Moments after Ahmed disarmed the first attacker, police moved in. An officer approached from behind the bridge and shot the remaining gunman dead. Separate footage later showed officers administering CPR to one of the suspects.At least 11 were killed in the attack. Twenty-nine others were taken to the hospital. NSW Ambulance said more than 26 resources were deployed, including helicopters and specialist paramedics. Several patients were treated at the scene, with others transported to hospitals across Sydney.Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the scenes were “shocking and distressing."" He added that police and emergency services were working to save lives.

Trump Roasted Over 'Lack Of Empathy' After Insensitive Remark On Brown University Shooting

(Photo released by police)

Hundreds of tips, but questions over cameras and campus security





A city on edge as victims’ stories emerge









Police investigating the deadly shooting at Brown University have released a new video timeline and clearer images of a masked suspect, as authorities continue an intensive search across Providence with no arrest yet made. The attack on Saturday left two students dead and nine others wounded.At a news conference on Tuesday, Providence Police Chief Oscar Perez presented what he described as an “enhanced” compilation of surveillance footage showing a person of interest moving around the Brown campus and nearby streets. The video appears stitched together from home security cameras and shows the suspect walking for about an hour, beginning shortly after 2 pm, within a few blocks of the engineering building where the shooting occurred at 4.03 pm.In all publicly released footage, the suspect’s face is either masked or turned away. Investigators have described him only in broad terms: stocky, about 5 feet 8 inches tall, wearing dark or brown clothing, including a jacket, hat, gloves and a shoulder bag. In some clips, the person is seen passing the same properties multiple times. In another, he abruptly turns and runs in the opposite direction when someone approaches.Footage taken minutes after the shooting shows the person walking away from a parking lot and continuing along a nearby street. Chief Perez said investigators believe the individual was “casing” the area beforehand, adding that such behaviour is typical of criminals preparing for an attack.Police, working alongside the FBI and state authorities, said around 200 tips have been received so far. Officers have been canvassing homes, yards and dumpsters in surrounding neighbourhoods, urging residents to recheck their camera systems for even fleeting images that could help identify the suspect.“We’re looking for a moment that is shorter than someone taking a breath,” Perez said. Despite Brown University having around 1,200 campus cameras, officials confirmed there is no clear footage from inside the engineering building itself, a gap that has frustrated investigators and raised wider concerns about security.Attorney General Peter Neronha said the investigation was going “really well” but urged patience, warning against speculation about motive or ideology. Brown President Christina Paxson defended the university’s emergency response, explaining why campus sirens were not activated, saying this could have driven people towards danger rather than away from it.Providence remained tense on Tuesday, with extra police deployed to schools and all after-school activities cancelled as a precaution. Parents spoke of fear, while students questioned whether security measures alone could prevent such violence.Details have also emerged about the victims. Two wounded students had been released from hospital, while others remained in critical or stable conditions. Among those killed was 19-year-old Ella Cook, a sophomore described by her church as a bright and uplifting presence. The other victim, 18-year-old MukhammadAziz Umurzokov, a freshman majoring in biochemistry and neuroscience, had long dreamed of becoming a neurosurgeon after overcoming serious health challenges as a child.","Police have released a new video timeline and clearer images of a masked suspect.

The attendee, who did not speak to the Reiners at the party, said that people seemed to be very aware of Nick Reiner's history with drug abuse, which the family has discussed publicly.Another attendee said that he did not witness the dispute, but he recognised Rob Reiner in the crowd and noticed the younger Reiner hovering at the fringes of the informal gathering.The guest said that he and other attendees were worried and that several people commented to him on Nick Reiner's behaviour, saying he looked anxious and uncomfortable in a way that deeply unsettled them. A third person who attended the party said that he saw the Reiners but did not see the argument.

Maduro’s response and regional fallout







US President Donald Trump has sharply escalated his confrontation with Venezuela, ordering what he called a “total and complete” blockade of sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving the country and declaring the Maduro government a “foreign terrorist organisation”.Announcing the decision late on Tuesday, Trump accused President Nicolás Maduro’s government of using oil revenues to finance drug trafficking and organised crime, while vowing to expand the US military presence around the South American nation. The announcement follows weeks of rising tension, including naval deployments, air patrols and the seizure of an oil tanker off Venezuela’s coast.Trump’s order targets all sanctioned oil vessels travelling to and from Venezuela, effectively formalising what oil traders say had already become a de facto embargo after US forces seized a tanker last week carrying an estimated two million barrels of Venezuelan crude.Since then, several tankers loaded with oil have remained in Venezuelan waters rather than risk interception.The administration has moved thousands of troops and nearly a dozen warships into the Caribbean, including an aircraft carrier, alongside maritime patrol aircraft and helicopters capable of tracking shipping routes across the region. While the White House has not detailed how the blockade will be enforced, analysts expect the US Navy and Coast Guard to play a central role.Oil markets reacted cautiously, with prices edging higher amid fears that Venezuelan exports could fall sharply. Venezuela produces about one million barrels of oil a day, exporting most of it. Any prolonged disruption could remove close to a million barrels a day from global supply, although traders note that supplies remain ample for now.The impact has been compounded by a cyberattack this week that disrupted systems at PDVSA, Venezuela’s state oil company, further slowing exports. Economists warn that a sustained blockade could trigger shortages of food and medicine by cutting off the country’s ability to earn foreign currency.Maduro’s government has condemned the blockade as illegal and accused Washington of piracy and economic warfare. In a statement, Caracas said Trump was violating international law and the principle of free navigation, adding that Venezuela would raise the issue at the United Nations.Speaking before Trump’s announcement, Maduro said the US was seeking to “colonise Venezuela” to seize its oil, gas and mineral wealth, and pledged to defend the country’s sovereignty. Venezuelan officials have also accused neighbouring Trinidad and Tobago of cooperating with the US during last week’s tanker seizure.Washington insists the military campaign is aimed at stopping drugs reaching the United States. Since early September, US forces have carried out more than 20 strikes on boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific, killing at least 95 people, according to official figures. The Pentagon has defended the strikes as lawful and effective, despite growing scrutiny from lawmakers.","US President Donald Trump has sharply escalated his confrontation with Venezuela.

Women drugged and raped by Colorado cardiologist on dates sue Tinder and Hinge for ‘accommodating rapists’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/women-drugged-and-raped-by-colorado-cardiologist-on-dates-sue-tinder-and-hinge-for-accommodating-rapists/articleshow/126021772.cms,"



Six women who say they were drugged and raped by a former Colorado cardiologist have filed a civil lawsuit against Match Group, the parent company of Tinder and Hinge, accusing the dating platforms of negligence and of “accommodating rapists” by allowing a known offender to remain active for years. The suit, filed in Denver district court, alleges that repeated reports about the man were ignored or mishandled, enabling him to continue meeting and assaulting women through the apps, as reported by The Guardian.According to the complaint, Match Group failed to act decisively after receiving multiple reports that Stephen Matthews, a Denver cardiologist, had drugged and sexually assaulted women he met on Hinge.The plaintiffs argue that even after assurances that Matthews had been “permanently banned”, his profile remained active or reappeared, allowing him to continue matching with users.The lawsuit claims the company fostered a “breeding ground for sexual predators”, alleging that known abusers were allowed to circulate freely on its platforms without adequate warnings to users.The women also accuse Hinge of operating a “defective” reporting system, arguing that users can unmatch with a victim before a report is filed, causing the reporting option to disappear.The suit further alleges that banned users can easily return to Match Group apps without changing key identifying details such as their name, date of birth or profile photos.Matthews was first reported to Hinge in 2020, according to the lawsuit, yet remained on dating apps until 2023. In October 2024, he was sentenced to 158 years to life in prison after being convicted on 35 counts related to drugging and sexually assaulting at least 11 women between 2019 and 2023.One plaintiff told CBS News that she met Matthews through Hinge in 2023 and believed she had been drugged shortly after arriving at his home. She later learned that women had reported him to the app years earlier. “Hinge was liable for giving him a platform,” she said, adding that the company had the resources to prevent further harm.The lawsuit draws heavily on an 18-month investigation by the Dating App Reporting Project, which found that Match Group had long been aware of serious safety issues on its platforms but did not publish promised transparency reports or fully address repeat-offender risks.Match Group has said it takes reports of misconduct seriously and is investing in safety measures such as AI moderation, identity verification and cooperation with law enforcement. Company executives have also acknowledged that stricter safety tools can reduce user numbers but say they are necessary for long-term trust.The women are seeking unspecified damages and say the lawsuit is intended to force meaningful changes in how dating apps handle reports of sexual violence. “Using a dating app should not mean accepting preventable danger,” one survivor said.","Six women have filed a civil lawsuit against Match Group, the parent company of Tinder and Hinge.

US travel ban: What the new proclamation says

The new proclamation continues full restrictions and entry limitations of nationals from the original 12 high-risk countries: Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen.

It adds full restrictions and entry limitations on five additional countries based on recent analysis: Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, South Sudan, and Syria, as well as individuals holding Palestinian-Authority-issued travel documents.

The new order imposes full restrictions and entry limitations on two countries that were previously subject to partial restrictions: Laos and Sierra Leone.

It continues partial restrictions on nationals from four of the seven original high-risk countries: Burundi, Cuba, Togo, and Venezuela.

The new proclamation lifts the existing ban on non-immigrant visas from Turkmenistan as it has engaged productively with the United States.

This adds partial restrictions and entry limitations on 15 additional countries: Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Benin, Cote d’Ivoire, Dominica, Gabon, The Gambia, Malawi, Mauritania, Nigeria, Senegal, Tanzania, Tonga, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.

The proclamation includes exceptions for lawful permanent residents, existing visa holders, certain visa categories like athletes and diplomats, and individuals whose entry serves U.S. national interests.

The proclamation also narrows broad family-based immigrant visa carve-outs that carry demonstrated fraud risks, while preserving case-by-case waivers.

In June, President Donald Trump announced that citizens of 12 countries would be banned from visiting the United States and those from seven others would face restrictions.The Trump administration said in its announcement of the expanded travel ban that many of the countries from which it was restricting travel had “widespread corruption, fraudulent or unreliable civil documents and criminal records” that made it difficult to vet their citizens for travel to the U.S.It also said some countries had high rates of people overstaying their visas, refused to take back their citizens who the U.S. wished to deport or had a “general lack of stability and government control,” which made vetting difficult.Also includedIndividuals holding Palestinian Authority issued travel documentsLaosSierra Leone","In June, President Donald Trump announced that citizens of 12 countries would be banned from visiting the United States and those from seven others would face restrictions.

The Immigration and Customs Enforcement called Minnesota Rep Ilhan Omar a liar for alleging that her son was pulled over by federal agents. The ICE said the agency has absolutely zero record of its officers or agents pulling over Congresswoman Omar’s son. Calling it a PR stunt, the ICE said Ilhan Omar's allegation did not come with any evidence. The agency also addressed the fine print of the allegation and said they don't target people by skin color, race or ethnicity. ""Allegations that ICE engages in ‘racial profiling’ are disgusting, reckless and categorically FALSE. What makes someone a target for immigration enforcement is if they are illegally in the U.S.—NOT their skin color, race, or ethnicity.Under the Fourth Amendment of the US Constitution, DHS law enforcement uses “reasonable suspicion” to make arrests,"" the agency said.In a recent interview, Ilhan Omar said her son was pulled over by ICE agents and was asked to show his proof of citizenship. His son had his passport as he always carries this and he was let go, Ilhan Omar said adding that this was not the first time that her son was targeted. ICE once entered a mosque where her son was praying and since then her son always keeps his passport with him.""They are looking for young men who look Somali that they think are undocumented,"" Ilhan Omar said.After Ilhan Omar's allegation, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said ICE acts with the “utmost professionalism.” “Anyone pointing the finger at law enforcement officers instead of the criminals are simply doing the bidding of criminal illegal aliens,” she said in a statement. But now ICE has refuted the incident.The Somali-origin Congresswoman became a US citizen in 2000 but now calls for deporting her getting louer as President Donald Trump said Ilhan Omar gained US citizenship by marrying her brother. Omar dismissed the rumors long ago and asserted that none of her three husbands is a brother.

H-1Bs getting 221(g) slip from visa officers after social media vetting begins: What does this mean?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/h-1bs-getting-221g-slip-from-visa-officers-after-social-media-vetting-begins-what-does-this-mean/articleshow/126019667.cms,"What is a 221(g) slip?





After the US State Department started social media vetting on December 15, there is now no immediate approval or rejection of visa appeals and candidates are issued a 221(g) slip. Candidates are also being asked whether they made their social media accounts public and then the visa approval status is updated online. Users on Reddit shared that some saw their status changed to 'approved' by the end of the day while some said they are still waiting even after two days. The visa officers are also keeping the passports of the candidates which, according to Reddit, is a sign that the request will be approved sooner -- if the officer returns to passport, many believe the request may take two to three months.A 221(g) slip is a notice given by a US consular officer after a visa interview saying your visa cannot be approved right now under Section 221(g) of the U.S. Immigration and Nationality Act. It does not mean a denial—it means the case is temporarily refused pending more action. But now everyone is getting this slip. It means additional documents are needed or the case requires administrative processing or some clarification is required.The slip comes in various colors and now almost all candidates are getting white slip. There is no standard meaning of the colors worldwide and they may vary from consulate to consulate but after social media vetting started, the standard meaning the 221(g) slip conveys is that the decision is pending for social media vetting.According to immigration experts, the color of the slip does not determine the outcome, the written instructions do.For social media vetting, H-1B and H-4 visa appointments have been deferred all of a sudden and the H-1Bs of India were the worst hit. Many Indian H-1Bs flew to India to attend their visa stamping in India only to find that the date has been deferred to April, May next year.

""Exactly, gives us hope that the system is correcting itself,"" another wrote.

""If this post is real then it is an almost cartoonishly perfect example of how the system is being misused by corporations,"" a third user wrote.

""They made the decision to withdraw my application for the H-1B visa barring risk of rejection because the new role was “too general” to be qualified for the H-1B visa.

Pakistan’s Asim Munir Threatens India With 'Severe Response' In First Speech After Becoming CDF





In a first since partition, a course on ancient language Sanskrit has been introduced in a university in Pakistan, The Tribune reported. The Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS) has introduced the course, with Hindu mythologies like Mahabharat and Gita on the cards too.“People ask me why I’m learning Sanskrit. I tell them, why should we not learn it? It is the binding language of the entire region. Sanskrit grammarian Panini’s village was in this region. Much writing was done here during the Indus Valley Civilisation. Sanskrit is like a mountain--a cultural monument. We need to own it. It is ours too; it’s not tied to any one particular religion,” The Tribune quoted associate professor, Shahid Rasheed, who is at the heart of the initiative saying.“A significant collection of Sanskrit palm-leaf manuscripts were catalogued in the 1930s by scholar JCR Woolner, but no Pakistani academic has engaged with this collection since 1947. Only foreign researchers use it. Training scholars locally will change that,” the news outlet quoted the director of the Gurmani Centre, Ali Usman Qasmi, saying.“In 10-15 years, we could see Pakistan-based scholars of the Gita and the Mahabharata,” Qasmi added.The Sanskrit course began as a three-month weekend workshop only to eventually become a four-credit university course after it received an overwhelming response.“After we saw the response, we decided to introduce it as a proper university course. Even though the number of students is still small, we hope it will grow over the next few years. Ideally, by spring 2027, we should be able to teach the language as a year-long course,” the director said.","A course on ancient language Sanskrit has been introduced in a university in Pakistan.

Mistook bomb for toy: Blast at Pakistan school in Waziristan; two children killed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/mistook-bomb-for-toy-blast-at-pakistan-school-in-waziristan-two-children-killed/articleshow/125926997.cms,"



Two children have been killed and more than a dozen others injured in a blast at a seminary in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, in an incident that has deepened anxiety in a region already struggling with insecurity.Police said the explosion occurred in North Waziristan’s Mir Ali area at about 2pm after students brought a mortar shell into Madressah Shams-ul-Quran, having mistaken it for a toy they found outside, Dawn reported.The device detonated while the children were playing with it, killing two instantly and injuring 16 others. Several of the wounded were later transferred to hospitals in Bannu and nearby districts.Local officials said security forces had earlier warned residents that an unexploded mortar had landed in the area and urged civilians to avoid it. However, the warning did not reach everyone, and the children unknowingly carried the device into the seminary, as per Dawn.The incident came amid growing concern about public safety in North Waziristan, which on the same day saw a separate overnight attack that destroyed a government primary school in Mir Ali. Officials said explosives were planted at the building in Ayaz Kot, leaving more than 600 children without a place to study.Much of the structure was reduced to rubble, prompting authorities to seal the site and begin planning temporary arrangements for classes.Parents and elders condemned the destruction as a deliberate assault on the community’s future. One elder said the school had been “the heart of our community”, describing its loss as an attack on children’s hopes, Express Tribune reported.Security forces have launched a search operation, though no group has claimed responsibility. District officials called the bombing an “anti-education act” and promised those responsible would be brought to justice. Initial assessments suggest the explosives were detonated remotely or with a timer.","Two children killed and more than a dozen others injured in blast at a seminary in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

It started with a simple question —— and ended in full-blown comedy inside Pakistan’s National Assembly.During Monday’s session of the National Assembly in Islamabad, Speaker Ayaz Sadiq found ten PKR 5,000 notes on the chamber floor and called for the owner to identify them.“Whose money is this? Whoever it belongs to, please raise your hand,” the Speaker asked, waving the bundle of notes in the air.Within seconds, 12–13 MPs raised their hands to claim the money. On seeing this, the Speaker quipped, “There are 10 notes, yet 12 owners.” Proceedings were briefly halted amid the laughter and confusion.A video of the episode went viral on social media, with many Pakistanis mocking their lawmakers. According to the viral video, the money was later retrieved by Muhammad Iqbal Afridi, an MP from Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party, who collected it from the Assembly office.As the video gained traction, critics called for the MPs who raised their hands to be held in contempt of Parliament and dismissed.“The Speaker missed 25 calls from Sharif brothers,” tweeted Mahnoor Asif. Another user commented, “They take salaries and perks in millions, yet this is their state.”A user said, ""This is the time of the Parliament and the parliamentarians present in the Parliament Five thousand notes, one person's pocket and claimants of money—12 members of the National Assembly have raised their hands.

Pakistan’s military and intelligence agencies face the daunting task of differentiating between groups that sometimes share fluid alliances or conflicting rivalries. Heavy-handed military operations risk alienating local populations and driving recruitment, while political engagement with some groups risks being seen as appeasement. International implications India, Iran, and even China watch these internal Trojan horses with varying stakes. India’s support to Baloch separatists, Iran’s concerns about Baloch unrest along its border, and China’s economic interests in Balochistan add layers of strategic complexity.

Conventional approaches falter

Military campaigns may suppress one group temporarily but provide recruits and sympathy to another.

Political negotiations get undermined when factions splinter or external events shift local calculations—such as the Taliban’s victory in Afghanistan.

Economic development efforts in Balochistan are hampered by ongoing violence but are critical to addressing root causes.

Cross-border sanctuaries and international gray zones complicate decisive action.

Multi-pronged strategy

Enhanced Border Security and Regional Diplomacy Strengthening border management with Afghanistan and Iran, paired with robust diplomatic engagement, can limit militant sanctuaries and cross-border flows.

Balochistan ground sweeps





The challenges Pakistan faces today are often described in binary terms — a threat here, a conflict there — but the reality is far more chaotic and intricate, much like the scientific conundrum known as the ""three-body problem"". This problem, rooted in physics and celestial mechanics, deals with predicting the motions of three gravitational bodies interacting with each other. The paradox is that while two bodies' orbits can be predicted with relative simplicity, introducing a third body creates a system so unstable and non-linear that exact forecasts become practically impossible. Pakistan's existential security dilemmas resemble this dynamic complexity: three powerful, interrelated forces that simultaneously influence and destabilize the country’s internal and external equilibrium.These three forces are the Taliban , the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan ( TTP ), and the Baloch insurgency.Individually, each represents a serious security threat. Collectively, their interactions generate overlapping, tangled challenges that confound policy, military strategy, and diplomatic efforts.Recent escalations are a stark reminder of this peril. In October 2025, Pakistan launched airstrikes in Kabul and other Afghan sites targeting TTP leader Noor Wali Mehsud, prompting Taliban retaliation on Pakistani border posts and further Pakistani precision strikes killing dozens of militants.Meanwhile, Baloch attacks surged 53% in 2024 to 938 incidents with over 1,002 fatalities, spilling into 2025 with high-profile hits on CPEC projects.Over 300 attacks rocked Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2025 alone, mostly TTP-led.For the first time since 2015, the number of terror attacks in Pakistan crossed the 900-mark.Grasping their interplay is crucial to understanding why Pakistan’s security apparatus struggles to restore stability — and why conventional approaches have so far failed.The Taliban, an Islamist militant group born in Afghanistan in the mid-1990s, rose to international prominence with its capture of Kabul in 1996.Following the US invasion after 9/11, the group was ousted but persisted with insurgency tactics. The Taliban's return to power in Afghanistan in 2021 reshaped regional dynamics and profoundly impacted Pakistan.For Pakistan, the Taliban's ascendance is something of a double-edged sword. On one hand, Islamabad sees the group as a strategic asset to exert influence in Kabul and counter Indian presence in Afghanistan. On the other hand, the Taliban's ideological affinity with Pakistan's own Pashtun tribal regions and cross-border networks complicates Islamabad's control over militancy within its own borders.The Taliban's ideology and governance style also inspire elements within Pakistan, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the tribal belt. This ideological inspiration runs parallel to fears that the group's Afghan governance failures or hardline policies could spill over, destabilising Pakistan’s own tribal regions.The Afghan Taliban's 2021 takeover initially promised Pakistan leverage against India, but it backfired spectacularly. Kabul's refusal to dismantle TTP sanctuaries hosting 6,000-6,500 fighters armed with leftover NATO weapons has fueled Islamabad's woes. Tensions peaked in December 2025 with heavy cross-border fire exchanges killing five Afghans, amid soured ties since 2021.Experts like Tahir Khan note the Taliban's inaction strains relations, pushing Pakistan to airstrikes that risk radicalising more TTP factions toward rivals like ISKP. Failed Istanbul peace talks in October 2025 saw Pakistan threaten to ""obliterate"" the Taliban regime after unmet demands on TTP expulsion. Sirajuddin Haqqani dismissed TTP as Pakistan's ""internal matter,"" vowing forceful responses to violations.This dynamic grants TTP ""strategic depth"" unparalleled in its history, enabling mergers and centralisation under Mehsud. As analyst Hazrat Ali warns, Pakistani pressure on Kabul could splinter TTP, worsening regional chaos.Pakistan’s newly appointed armed forces chief Gen. Asim Munir recently called on Afghanistan’s Taliban government to choose between maintaining ties with Islamabad or supporting the Pakistani Taliban.Munir said that a “clear message” had been delivered to the Taliban government in Kabul: it must decide between Pakistan and “Fitna al-Khawarij,” a term authorities use for the outlawed Pakistani Taliban, known a s Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan.While the Afghan Taliban exerts influence across the border, the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan represents a homegrown, highly violent insurgency directly challenging the Pakistani state’s writ. Originating as an umbrella militant organisation around 2007, the TTP embodies a coalition of various Islamist militants and tribal groups united against Islamabad's military operations.The TTP has been responsible for some of the deadliest terrorist attacks in Pakistan over the past decade, targeting military installations, government buildings, schools, and civilian populations. Despite several attempted peace negotiations, the TTP's fractured yet resilient network has shown a capacity to regroup, regrouping largely within the tribal regions of northwestern Pakistan and even spilling across the Afghan border during periods of instability.The group opposes Pakistan’s state institutions vehemently and views the military, intelligence agencies, and secular political frameworks as existential enemies. Unlike the Afghan Taliban, which now nominally controls Kabul, the TTP pursues a more violent, confrontational agenda rooted in the Pakistani context.The TTP roared back post-Taliban victory. In 2024, it drove over half of 900+ attacks in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, killing 560+, with 67% targeting security forces. By 2025, its operations hit 600+ confrontations, surpassing all of 2024.A stark October 8, 2025, ambush in Kurram killed 11 Pakistani soldiers, including two officers, via roadside bombs and heavy weapons—exposing border vulnerabilities.TTP now eyes tribal belt control, mirroring Afghan Taliban's path, per CTC West Point analysis. Mehsud's unification of splinters has boosted recruitment, with propaganda invoking Baloch grievances to broaden appeal.Security data shows 96% of attacks in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, blending armed assaults and IEDs, as TTP demands military divestment from businesses. This resurgence, analysts say, stems from Afghan havens, turning Pakistan's past militant proxies into monsters.Simultaneously, Pakistan faces an insurgency in Balochistan—a sprawling, resource-rich, but underdeveloped southwestern province. The Baloch nationalist movement goes back decades, demanding greater autonomy, resource control, and sometimes outright independence. The insurgency has fluctuated in intensity but remains a persistent thorn in Islamabad’s side.Baloch militants have targeted Pakistani security forces, infrastructure projects, and economic installations such as the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)—a flagship regional development initiative. The province's rugged terrain and Baloch tribal dynamics create a challenging environment for Pakistani counterinsurgency efforts.Unlike the religious militancy of the Taliban and TTP, the Baloch insurgency is rooted in ethnic nationalism and grievances over political marginalization, economic neglect, and human rights abuses. This ideological and geographical distinctiveness makes it harder for the Pakistani state to craft a unified internal security strategy.Attacks ballooned to 327 sites across 25 districts in 2024, with 80% fatality spike to 1,002+. The March 11, 2025, Jaffar Express hijacking by BLA-Jeeyand killed 26 hostages and kidnapped 400+, showcasing tactical evolution from hit-and-runs to coordinated ops.CPEC remains prime target: Operation Dara-e-Bolan in January 2024 and March 2025 barrages hit Chinese workers, amid Israel-Iran and India-Pakistan tensions stoking fears of wider nexuses. BLA's sophistication targets BRI, militarizing the region further.Unlike TTP's jihadism, Baloch fights for autonomy, but heavy state crackdowns alienate locals, per CTC analysis. Injuries rose to 689, property losses to 546, signaling expanded reach despite counter-ops killing 76 insurgents.Here lies Pakistan’s three-body problem: the Taliban, TTP, and Baloch insurgency don’t operate in isolation.Their influences collide, interact, and ripple across Pakistan’s geopolitical landscape in unpredictable ways.Traditional counterinsurgency and counterterrorism strategies rely on clear, identifiable enemies that can be neutralised through military might, intelligence operations, or negotiated settlements. The three-body dynamic, however, forces Pakistan to wrestle with fluid, overlapping, and at times contradictory challenges.In essence, each ""body"" in this problem pulls Pakistan’s security landscape in different directions, making any single policy or operation insufficient.Addressing this three-body problem requires Pakistan to adopt a holistic, integrated strategy that acknowledges the distinct yet intertwined nature of these challenges.Pakistan's military has intensified operations since mid-2025 to counter the Taliban-TTP-Baloch nexus, focusing on intelligence-based strikes (IBOs), cross-border actions, and sustained ground campaigns amid over 1,000 attacks nationwide. These efforts emphasize decapitation of TTP leadership, border denial, and Baloch insurgency suppression, though resource strains from multi-front threats limit gains.The army launched precision airstrikes into Afghanistan targeting TTP hideouts. On October 9, 2025, raids hit Kabul, Khost, Jalalabad, and Paktika, aiming at TTP chief Noor Wali Mehsud's headquarters, killing dozens of militants despite his survival claim. Retaliatory Taliban attacks on border posts prompted further Pakistani strikes on October 11-12, neutralizing Taliban brigades and TTP operatives.Recent IBOs in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa yielded kills: December 5-6 saw nine TTP fighters eliminated in Tank and Lakki Marwat districts. September 13 clashes in South Waziristan and Lower Dir killed 35 militants but cost 19 soldiers, highlighting ambush risks. December 6-7 Chaman border strikes destroyed three Taliban bases, killing 23 fighters after ceasefire violations.Operation Azm-e-Istehkam, ramped up in summer 2025, reports near-daily TTP neutralizations in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, addressing a terrorism surge to highest levels since 2015.In Balochistan, May 2025 operations deployed over 40 vehicles in Surab, Zehri, and Khuzdar, declaring areas ""sensitive"" to hunt Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) amid 70+ attacks under Operation Herof. August 30 actions post-BLA civilian strikes killed five insurgents and captured two in Kech, part of Azm-e-Istehkam's escalation.Security forces targeted BLA convoys, camps, and intelligence squads, seizing arms despite BLA claims of 25 blockades and 15 camp captures in 2024-2025. These ops focus on CPEC protection, countering 938 incidents with 1,002 fatalities in 2024 extending into 2025.The ongoing volatility reveals that no single strategy will yield a definitive victory; instead, Pakistan must adopt nuanced, integrated policies that combine hard military pressure with political dialogue, regional diplomacy, and socioeconomic inclusion.The future of Pakistan’s sovereignty and regional peace depends on how skillfully it navigates this chaotic three-body problem, turning a disordered struggle into a managed equilibrium before the forces pull the nation into further unrest and fragmentation.","Pakistan’s western tribal belt and Balochistan both border Afghanistan and Iran, turning these regions into transnational conflict zones.

Pakistan ex-ISI chief jailed: Faiz Hameed convicted after court martial; handed 14 years in prison,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-ex-isi-chief-jailed-faiz-hameed-convicted-after-court-martial-handed-14-years-in-prison/articleshow/125908182.cms,"Uncertainty Over Pakistan’s Top Military Post Could Trigger Conflict: Analyst





A Pakistani military court has sentenced former inter-services intelligence (ISI) director general Lt Gen (retd) Faiz Hameed to 14 years in prison after a 15-month-long court-martial on multiple charges, including political interference and violations of the official secrets act.The Field General Court Martial, held under the Pakistan army act, found Hameed guilty on four counts - engaging in political activities, misuse of authority and state resources, violation of the official secrets act, and causing wrongful loss to individuals. The military did not identify who suffered such losses. Officials said Hameed was provided full legal rights and representation during the proceedings. He retains the right to appeal.Hameed, once considered a close confidant of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan , had been detained in 2024 after an internal investigation linked to the Top City housing project near Islamabad. Until Thursday's announcement, neither the charges nor details of the probe had been formally disclosed by the government or the military.Security analyst Syed Muhammad Ali told AP that the verdict followed “a lengthy investigation that gave the former ISI chief ample opportunity to defend himself.”He added: “The decision signals the military leadership’s intent that no officer, regardless of rank, will be allowed to engage in politics, and Hameed’s case has been made an example for all retired officers.”Hameed’s downfall marks a rare instance of a high-ranking former military official facing such a stiff sentence in Pakistan, where the army holds significant institutional influence and senior-level prosecutions are uncommon.His political proximity to Imran Khan had long drawn attention. Khan - who was ousted in 2022 through a no-confidence vote and has since criticized the military and political leadership for his removal - is serving multiple jail terms on graft and other charges. The military, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s government and the US have all denied Khan’s claim that they engineered his exit.","Lt Gen (retd) Faiz Hameed sentenced to 14 years in prison.

Putin 'BOMBS' Ukraine With Russia's 9M729 Cruise Missile; Is This Why Trump Ordered Nuclear Tests?

What is the 9M729?





Russia has, in recent months, used a cruise missile against Ukraine that led US President Donald Trump to withdraw from a key nuclear arms control pact with Moscow back in 2019.The 9M729 missile, reportedly developed in secret, prompted the United States to withdraw from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty during Donald Trump’s first term.Signed in 1987 by-then US President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev near the end of the Cold War, the INF Treaty banned all ground-launched missiles with ranges between 500 and 5,500 kilometers.The agreement aimed to reduce the concentration of potentially nuclear-armed weapons deployed by Russia and Nato across Europe, as cited by the Kyiv Independent.Russia has launched the 9M729 missile at Ukraine 23 times since August and had previously fired it twice in 2022, a senior Ukrainian official said, as cited by Reuters.Washington has accused Russia of violating the treaty by developing the 9M729 missile, which it says can travel well beyond the 500 km (310 miles) limit, a claim that Moscow has denied.According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies’ Missile Threat project, the missile is capable of carrying either a nuclear or conventional warhead and has a range of up to 2,500 km. One such missile fired by Russia on October 5 flew more than 1,200 km before striking Ukraine, a military official said, as cited by Reuters.""Russia's use of the INF-banned 9M729 against Ukraine in the past months demonstrates (President Vladimir) Putin's disrespect to the United States and President Trump's diplomatic efforts to end Russia's war against Ukraine,"" Andrii Sybiha, Ukraine's foreign minister, said in written remarks to Reuters.Images from the aftermath of a Russian strike on October 5 showed debris from a residential building hit in the Ukrainian village of Lapaiivka, where four people were killed.The village lies more than 600 km from Russian territory, and the fragments included two missile parts, one of them a tube with wiring, both marked 9M729, as reported by Reuters.Meanwhile, Russia has tested its nuclear-powered Burevestnik cruise missile last week and announced on Wednesday that it had also conducted a test of its nuclear-powered Poseidon torpedo.Trump on Friday also reaffirmed plans to resume nuclear testing, days after announcing that he had instructed the Pentagon to restart weapons tests.","The 9M729 missile, reportedly developed in secret, prompted the United States to withdraw from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty during Donald Trump’s first term.

'This is no way to treat US representative': Nancy Mace accused of cursing at TSA officers; congresswoman denies allegations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/this-is-no-way-to-treat-us-representative-nancy-mace-accused-of-cursing-at-tsa-officers-congresswoman-denies-allegations/articleshow/125008806.cms,"Nancy Mace refutes claims, calls it 'fake'





Representative Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) on Friday reportedly cursed at police officers and Transportation Security Administration personnel at Charleston International Airport, calling them “f***ing incompetent” and demanding treatment she believed befitted a member of Congress, according to an incident report.The episode took place this week when officers from the Charleston County Aviation Authority Police Department arrived at the ticketing curb at 6.30 am and, finding no sign of the congresswoman, located her around 7 am at a trusted traveller checkpoint.The report says Mace began shouting at officers, insisting “this is no way to treat a US representative” as she was escorted to her gate.“The entire walk to gate B-8 she was cursing and complaining and often doing the same into her phone,” an officer wrote.“After standing in the vicinity of B-8 for several minutes with her continuing her tirade, she finally boarded the aircraft.”Mace called the reports fake news. On X, Mace shared a video of her arrival and challenged media accounts, writing “for the FAKE NEWS: This is the entrance ALL Members of Congress use at the airport. Are you going to write that Senators Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott use the same entrance or no? Or no?”A spokesperson for Mace, Cameron Morabito, told Newsweek via email, “Apparently, simply arriving at an airport now makes headlines if you’re leading the race for Governor.We are forced to take the Congresswoman’s safety extremely seriously. After the world watched Charlie Kirk’s assassination, the threats against her have only intensified. Our security procedures are based solely on legitimate safety concerns, and any attempt to politicise this reality is both dangerous and reckless. ”Mace also criticised The Post & Courier of Charleston, accusing the paper of getting the story “wrong” and asserting, “Once again, The Post and Courier gets it wrong.All federally elected officials including Senators Scott and Graham use the same Crew Member Access Point at airports. That’s the federal security protocol. Maybe check your facts next time.”She further accused her fellow gubernatorial candidate Alan Wilson of “spying on me at the airport” and wrote, “I wish Alan Wilson spent as much time prosecuting p*dophiles as he does spying on me at the airport.”The episode also comes as airport security and TSA personnel face heightened pressure amid the ongoing govt shutdown, which has strained staffing and operations.It remains unclear whether TSA or airport police will take any disciplinary action related to the confrontation. According to a Trafalgar Group poll published earlier this month, Mace trailed Lieutenant Governor Pamela Evette in the South Carolina gubernatorial primary with 15.8 percent to Evette’s 19.9 percent.Attorney General Alan Wilson secured 12.4 percent, Representative Ralph Norman 9.3 percent and State Senator Josh Kimbrell 1.3 percent. More than 40 percent of voters remained undecided. TSA supervisor Johnny Lynch told Fits News he planned to file a report with his superiors about Mace’s “unacceptable behaviour.”","Representative Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) reportedly cursed at police officers and Transportation Security Administration personnel at Charleston International Airport.

What does the new e-passport rollout actually mean?

New e-passport = chip inside: The upgraded passport contains an electronic chip with digitised passport data to speed up immigration clearance and improve security. Applicants will be able to upload a digital, ICAO-compliant photo, signature and supporting documents through the new portal.

No extra biometrics or fees: The Indian Embassy in Abu Dhabi and the Consulate in Dubai stated explicitly that biometric collection rules and passport fees remain unchanged for applicants in the UAE. If you’ve given biometrics for a recent passport, you will not be asked again just because of the e-passport introduction.

Who issues them: The Embassy and Consulate will process applications through the Passport Seva Portal (GPSP 2.0) with support from BLS International for on-the-ground services. Missions say they can handle large volumes around 1,600 passports a day across the UAE to speed renewals and new issues.

Indian expats in the UAE can finally put the rumours to rest. During a press conference held on October 30, 2025 by the Embassy of India in Abu Dhabi and the Consulate General of India in Dubai, officials clarified that the rollout of India’s new chip-enabled e-passport will not involve any extra biometrics, new procedures, or fee changes for applicants in the UAE.

The White House turned into a haunted mansion with a presidential twist on Thursday night, as President Donald and Melania Trump hosted a Halloween spectacle straight out of a comic book.Superheroes, dinosaurs, and even pint-sized Trumps and Melanias stormed the South Lawn — while the First Couple, skipping costumes, made a dramatic entrance to the spooky strains of Thriller, AP image.They handed out chocolate to hundreds of costumed children, just hours after the president returned from a five-day swing through Asia.The Trumps took a particular liking to three siblings dressed as a Secret Service agent, the President and the First Lady.Trump gave his doppelganger a high-five before asking the trio to turn around and pose for photographs. The President pointed to the young girl and appeared to mouth, “Melania,” to reporters.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt and deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller were among the administration officials partaking in the festivities.Leavitt and her husband, Nicholas Riccio, brought their 1-year-old son in an adorable jack o’lantern outfit.Miller, wearing a suit and tie, was spotted trying to wrangle his young son, who appeared to be in a ghost costume, while his wife, Katie, held their other child, both dressed as skeletons.One of the most unusual costumes belonged to a boy who came dressed as a filthy toilet, with a “wide load” sign on the back. Trump seemed amused by the party pooper and gave him a chocolate bar. One of the most clever ensembles may have been a family who outfitted their wagon to look like a McDonald’s drive-thru.The Halloween event is an annual White House tradition. Last year, former President Joe Biden awkwardly pretended to bite several infants in the rope line, including one dressed up as a chicken.Perhaps the most memorable Trump Halloween moment took place in 2019, when he placed a candy bar on the head of a kid in a Minion costume during his first term. Trump did it again this year, with a youngster in an unidentified costume with particularly flat headgear.","The White House turned into a haunted mansion with a presidential twist on Thursday night.

Thanksgiving travel at risk

What Happens if the Shutdown Continues?

Military:

Federal civilian workers:

Air traffic controllers:





Nearly a month into the shutdown, food banks across the country were straining to meet rising demand from hundreds of thousands of federal workers who were furloughed or working without pay and were bracing for an even bigger surge as benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program were set to lapse on Nov. 1.More than one in eight Americans depended on food stamps from SNAP, according to the US Department of Agriculture. Recipients received an average of $187 a month on a prepaid card to buy groceries, and many families relied on those benefits as their main source of money for food, CBS news reported.The Community Table Food Bank in Arvada, Colorado, was so inundated with people on Thursday that it had to temporarily close. Before it did, Danielle Brann, a SNAP recipient, obtained essentials including ham and crackers and cans of spaghetti sauce.“The line started at 9 o’clock this morning and I don’t remember ever seeing it this busy. I mean they’re turning people away. So it’s more of a demand for sure,” Brann said.In Delaware County, Pennsylvania, the Loaves and Fishes Food Pantry also had to turn people away on Tuesday because food was leaving the shelves faster than it could be restocked.Vice President JD Vance and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned that Americans could face a travel “disaster” as Thanksgiving approaches next month without an end in sight to the govt shutdown.Their comments came after Vance hosted a roundtable of aviation, travel and union leaders at the White House, during which they aired their concerns with the current state of the industry and worked out potential, temporary solutions to ease the strain on Federal Aviation Administration employees who were being forced to work without pay to ensure Americans could fly safely, two White House officials told CNN.“Look it could be a disaster. It really could be, because at that point you’re talking about people have missed three paychecks. They’ve missed four paychecks. How many of them are not going to show up for work?” Vance said.“That’s going to lead to massive delays. We want people to be able to get home for Thanksgiving. We want people to be able to travel for business,” he continued.Air traffic control staffing problems spiked over the weekend, raising concerns about growing disruption Duffy added, “Our traffic will be snarled, but it will be a disaster in aviation.”More than a million active-duty service members in the United States would have missed their pay cheques on Friday if the Trump administration will not intervene, BBC reported.About a quarter of military families were considered food insecure, and 15% relied on Snap or food pantries, according to research firm Rand. Meanwhile, the Military Family Advisory Network estimated that 27% of families had £380 or less in emergency savings.The Pentagon said it had accepted a $130m gift from a wealthy donor to help pay salaries during the shutdown, which worked out to $100 for each of the 1.3 million service members expecting to be paid.The White House planned to pay the troops on 31 October by using money from a military housing fund, a research-and-development account and a defence procurement fund, according to Axios.Earlier this month the administration made payroll by moving $6.5bn from military research. More than 160 families told the National Military Family Association that they had been underpaid during the shutdown, some by hundreds of dollars and others by thousands.If the shutdown continues, then some 4.5 million paycheques would have been withheld from civilian employees, representing about $21bn in missing wages, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center.Furloughed employees were typically paid after shutdowns ended, although Trump had threatened to withhold pay and was attempting to fire thousands of workers, a move being challenged in court.Thousands of air traffic controllers missed their first paycheques this week. And if it continues, then the flight delay will also continue.Because they are considered essential workers, the workers must continue to do their jobs without pay during the shutdown. Since 1 October, numerous controllers have called in sick and now many report they are getting second jobs.","More than one in eight Americans depended on food stamps from SNAP, according to the US Department of Agriculture.

UAE petrol and diesel prices in November 2025: Will drivers finally get relief at the pump?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-petrol-and-diesel-prices-in-november-2025-will-drivers-finally-get-relief-at-the-pump/articleshow/124985814.cms,"UAE motorists eagerly await November’s petrol price update

Fuel Type Price in AED Price in INR (Approx.) Super 98 AED 2.77/L ~₹63.71/L Special 95 AED 2.66/L ~₹61.18/L E-Plus 91 AED 2.58/L ~₹59.34/L Diesel AED 2.71/L ~₹62.33/L

November 2025 fuel prices

What’s Driving the November price Buzz?

Oil prices dropped to around $65 a barrel, raising hopes for a price cut.

Then global supply tensions and sanctions sent prices jumping again up by nearly 5% in one day.

What will become cheaper if prices drop in November?

Daily Commutes Get Cheaper: If you drive to work five days a week, your monthly fuel spend could drop by AED 15–40, depending on distance and car type. It may not feel like a jackpot but over a year, that’s a few brunches saved.

School Runs for Parents: Parents doing multiple school pick-ups and drop-offs will feel this the most. With fewer refills, you save not just dirhams… but also those “Why are we stopping for petrol again?” kid complaints.

Delivery & Ride-Hailing Services: Talabat, Deliveroo, Careem, Uber, RTA taxis, chauffeur services, all rely heavily on petrol costs. If fuel drops, operating costs drop and sometimes customers enjoy lower delivery fees or promo rides.

Business Transport & Logistics: Couriers, small business vans, carpenters, maintenance and AC technicians, all feel the heat when fuel rises. Cheaper petrol can mean:

Lower service charges Fewer fuel surcharges Better deals for customers

Weekends and Road Trips Become More Tempting: Lower fuel prices = guilt-free drives to Abu Dhabi, Fujairah, Ras Al Khaimah or Hatta. A small drop in fuel cost could shave off AED 5–15 per road trip enough to justify that karak stop.

Explained: Why Saudi Arabia rejected Lionel Messi’s offer to join the Pro League,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/explained-why-saudi-arabia-rejected-lionel-messis-offer-to-join-the-pro-league/articleshow/124983032.cms,"Inter Miami forward Lionel Messi. (AP Photo)

Why Saudi rejected Messi's offer





Socrates

“Messi’s team contacted me and expressed his desire to play in Saudi Arabia during the MLS break to stay active and prepare for the 2026 World Cup,” Hammad said. “I presented the offer to the minister of sports, but he rejected it, confirming that the Saudi league would not serve as a preparation platform for other tournaments.”

“Messi set certain conditions and wanted to reunite with former Barcelona teammates,”

“while Ronaldo embraced the challenge of adapting to a new culture when he joined Al Nassr in 2022.”

“We brought the greatest player in history to our city, and now he’s chosen to stay, this strengthens our dream of building a lasting football legacy,”

Ronaldo’s enduring bond with Saudi Arabia

“My family always supports my decisions, and we're happy here in Saudi Arabia. The people treat us in an incredibly warm way. That's why we want to live here and build our lives here.”

“I will stay two more years as a football player, but also for life because my contribution to this country is not only for football... I want to be part of the country's growth forever.”

“We don't need to prove anything to anyone. I'm here on the Red Sea because I love it. My family and I feel at peace here... I love the culture. I'd just say: come and see it for yourself.”

The message behind the rejection









For a league once defined by its hunger for global validation, the Saudi Pro League seems to have entered a new phase, one of self-assurance. In recent years, Saudi Arabia has spent vast sums luring superstars such as Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymar, and Karim Benzema, positioning itself as football’s bold new frontier.So when Lionel Messi ’s team came knocking, proposing a short-term deal for the Argentine icon to play in Saudi Arabia during the Major League Soccer (MLS) off-season, one might have expected the Kingdom to seize the chance with open arms.Instead, the offer was politely but firmly declined.The revelation came from Abdullah Hammad, CEO of the Mahd Sports Academy, who shared the details during thepodcast hosted by Thmanyah. He said Messi’s representatives had approached him during the Club World Cup, suggesting a temporary four-month stint while the MLS paused.The decision marked a subtle but significant statement, a league once reliant on marquee names to attract attention now choosing principle over spectacle.Hammad compared the offer to David Beckham’s brief loan spell at AC Milan during his MLS years but noted that Saudi Arabia’s vision differs. The Roshn Saudi League, he said, is building, not acting as afor global stars between seasons.The episode also revealed contrasting philosophies between Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo.Hammad observed,Messi, who left Paris Saint-Germain in 2023, joined Inter Miami instead, where he recently extended his contract until 2028. According to, the deal is worth around €11 million annually, with bonuses pushing it close to €17 million, alongside major partnerships with Apple and Adidas, and a share of MLS streaming revenues.said Inter Miami co-owner David Beckham.The rejection of Messi’s offer underscores how far Saudi football has come. Once seen as a lavish detour for ageing stars, the Pro League is now asserting itself as a serious sporting ecosystem with its own ambitions, not merely a rest stop for players between continents.The country’s vast investment in football, coupled with plans to host the 2034 FIFA World Cup , reflects a long-term commitment to the sport’s growth. As Hammad put it, “The Saudi league would not serve as a preparation platform for other tournaments,” a line that captured both the maturity and the intent of a nation charting its own course.If Messi’s chapter in Saudi football never began, Ronaldo’s story continues to deepen. Earlier this year, after extending his Al Nassr contract until 2027, he declared Saudi Arabia his permanent home.In an interview shared via Al Nassr’s YouTube channel following the contract extension, Ronaldo said:He described the Kingdom as “a land of peace and safety,” adding:Saudi Arabia’s decision to turn down Messi wasn’t just about sport, it was about symbolism. The Kingdom’s football leadership appears determined to shift from buying fame to building legacy.If Messi’s approach had carried a sense of ambition and permanence rather than a brief off-season stint, the outcome might have been different.

US President Donald Trump on Friday reaffirmed that the US would resume nuclear testing, following his announcement this week that he was directing the Pentagon to restart the weapons tests.While talking with reporters on Air Force One in midair, Trump gave an indirect answer when asked whether he would include the traditional underground nuclear tests that were common during the Cold War.“You’ll find out very soon. But we’re going to do some testing, yeah,” Trump said on Air Force One. “Other countries do it. If they’re going to do it, we’re going to do it. I’m not going to say here.”On Wednesday, Trump directed the Pentagon to immediately begin testing US nuclear weapons on an equal basis to China and Russia. “The United States has more Nuclear Weapons than any other country,” the President wrote in a Truth Social post.“This was accomplished, including a complete update and renovation of existing weapons, during my First Term in office. Because of the tremendous destructive power, I HATED to do it, but had no choice! Russia is second, and China is a distant third, but will be even within 5 years.”The announcement came less than an hour before his highly anticipated meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea on trade.Trump initially ignored a question from a reporter on the announcement during his meeting with Xi, but told reporters afterwards that the news “had to do with others” when asked whether it had to do with Xi.“They seem to all be nuclear testing. We have more nuclear weapons than anybody,” the President said. “We don’t do testing, and we halted it many years ago, but with others doing testing, I think it’s appropriate that we do also,” he continued.North Korea is the only country that has carried out nuclear testing since the 1990s. Russia has been testing nuclear-capable weapons, which does not include setting off actual bombs. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has been testing missiles capable of having nuclear warheads as recently as this week.The United States conducted 1,054 nuclear tests between 1945 and 1992, most of them in Nevada, before halting amid growing environmental concerns and Cold War fatigue.During the 1950s, above-ground tests escalated tensions with the Soviet Union. President Eisenhower announced a pause in testing in 1958, assuming the Soviet Union would reciprocate, Axios reported.When the Soviets resumed tests in 1961, the US followed suit. In 1963, the US, the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union signed the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty to end tests in the atmosphere, outer space and underwater, driven by environmental concerns and fallout from the Cuban Missile Crisis.The Threshold Test Ban Treaty of 1974 limited underground tests to yields below 150 kilotons. In 1992, Congress passed a resolution prohibiting underground nuclear tests unless another state conducted one, establishing the current moratorium. President Clinton signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in 1997, but the Senate rejected ratification on national security grounds. Globally, as of August 2025, 187 state parties have signed the CTBT and 178 have ratified it.The US has signed — but not ratified — the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, leaving President Trump free under law to resume nuclear testing. His announcement has revived painful memories of the Cold War era, when open-air detonations sickened thousands across the American West. Lawmakers from Nevada, which hosted hundreds of tests, condemned the plan as both a public health hazard and a geopolitical provocation that could “lead to World War III,"" Politico reported.Experts argue there’s no technical need for renewed testing, noting the US already certifies its nuclear arsenal as safe through advanced simulations and experiments. Each new test could cost $140 million and risk reigniting global tensions. Trump allies, however, claim testing would project strength to China and Russia. Analysts warn such a move could alienate US allies, undermine nuclear restraint, and spark a new arms race just as key arms control treaties near expiration.","US President Donald Trump on Friday reaffirmed that the US would resume nuclear testing.

US President Donald Trump instructed his administration’s lawyers to seek court clarification on legally funding the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Programme (SNAP) after federal judges ordered the use of emergency funds in November to cover food stamp benefits.The rulings by federal judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island rejected a US Department of Agriculture (USDA) claim that it could not use a contingency fund to help cover the benefits, which were due to start distribution tomorrow amid the monthlong govt shutdown.“I do NOT want Americans to go hungry just because the Radical Democrats refuse to do the right thing and REOPEN THE GOVERNMENT. Therefore, I have instructed our lawyers to ask the Court to clarify how we can legally fund SNAP as soon as possible,"" the president wrote in a post on Truth Social.“It is already delayed enough due to the Democrats keeping the Government closed through the monthly payment date and, even if we get immediate guidance, it will unfortunately be delayed while States get the money out. If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding, just like I did with Military and Law Enforcement Pay,"" Trump added.He demanded the Democrats to quit this, and immediately reopen the government and warned, ""If you use SNAP benefits, call the Senate Democrats, and tell them to reopen the Government, NOW! Here is Cryin’ Chuck Schumer’s Office Number: (202) 224-6542.""Two federal judges on Friday ordered the federal govt to use contingency funds to maintain the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Programme (SNAP) benefits during the ongoing shutdown, following legal challenges from Democratic state attorneys general and governors in 25 states and the District of Columbia, AP reported.In Providence, Rhode Island, U.S. District Judge John J. McConnell ruled from the bench in a case brought by cities and non-profit organisations that the programme must be funded using at least the contingency funds and asked for a progress update by Monday. He also ordered that all existing waivers of SNAP work requirements, which the USDA had terminated for older adults, veterans and others, continue to be honoured.In Boston, U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani issued a written opinion calling the USDA’s suspension of benefits “unlawful” and directed the federal govt to inform the court by Monday whether it would use the emergency reserve funds to provide reduced SNAP benefits for November or fully fund the programme using both contingency funds and additional resources. “Defendants’ suspension of SNAP payments was based on the erroneous conclusion that the Contingency Funds could not be used to ensure continuation of SNAP payments,” she wrote. “This court has now clarified that Defendants are required to use those Contingency Funds as necessary for the SNAP programme.”The administration said it wasn’t allowed to use a contingency fund of about $5 billion for the program, which reversed a USDA plan from before the shutdown that said money would be tapped to keep SNAP running. The Democratic officials argued that not only could that money be used, but that it must be. They also said a separate fund with around $23 billion is available for the cause.",Two federal judges on Friday ordered the federal govt to use contingency funds to maintain the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Programme (SNAP) benefits during the ongoing shutdown.

'Why don't you engage with Hinduism too': Hindu American Foundation asks JD Vance as he comes clean on wife's religion,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/why-dont-you-engage-with-hinduism-too-hindu-american-foundation-asks-jd-vance-as-he-comes-clean-on-wifes-religion/articleshow/125004636.cms,"JD Vance was at the center of a major controversy after he said he hopes that his Hindu wife would one day convert to Christianity.

'She Has No Plans To Convert': JD Vance Clarifies Amid Row Over Remark On Wife's Faith





As Vice President JD Vance addressed the row over his statement about his wife Usha Vance's religion and made it clear that it was her faith that helped him reconnect with his own religion, the Hindu American Foundation asked the VP why he never thought of engaging with Hinduism as well. The organization said that, given the present anti-Hindu sentiment online, his public acknowledgement of the positive impact of Hinduism on him would be more reasonable.Accused of throwing his wife's religion under the bus, JD Vance said it's disgusting to interpret his statement in this way. JD Vance said Usha Vance is not a Christian and has no plans to convert but like many people in an interfaith marriage or an interfaith relationship, he hopes that she may one day see things as he does. ""Regardless, I'll continue to love and support her and talk to her about faith and life and everything else, because she's my wife,"" Vance said, adding that Usha is the most amazing blessing in his life and she encouraged him to re-engage with his faith.In 2019, JD Vance was baptized, years after his marriage to Usha Vance. Before that, he was an agnostic, as he called himself. He said Usha was also an agnostic when they first met.Vance defended his hope to see his wife converted and called it a Christian belief. ""Yes, Christians have beliefs. And yes, those beliefs have many consequences, one of which is that we want to share them with other people. That is a completely normal thing, and anyone who's telling you otherwise has an agenda,"" Vance said.But the religion controversy did not end with Vance's statement. The Hindu American Foundation expected him to engage with Hinduism.""If you did you may well learn that Hinduism doesn’t share the need to wish your spouse comes around to see things as you do in terms of religion. Hinduism is inherently inclusive and pluralistic in this way. We do not seek to convert anyone. We embrace the idea that there are multiple ways of conceiving of the Divine. Yet, there remains a compulsion, from some religious communities, to convert us to another way of thinking, that goes beyond mere dialog and sharing of differing opinions,"" the foundation said.HAF countered the belief that the path of salvation is only through Christ and asked if Hindus in America do not have religious freedom. ""Some of the most vocal voices in your base seem to not actually believe religious freedom — one of the core concepts this nation was founded upon, as you well know — should extend to Hindus,"" it said.","JD Vance said Usha Vance is not a Christian and has no plans to convert.

Former vice president Kamala Harris went on a furious rant on President Donald Trump , slamming his decision to build a new $300 million ballroom at the White House, demolishing the East Wing, while millions of Americans face the loss of food aid during the ongoing government shutdown.Speaking on The Weekly Show with Jon Stewart podcast, Harris accused Trump of prioritising luxury over lives. “Are you f--king kidding me?” she said angrily. “This guy wants to create a ballroom for his rich friends while completely turning a blind eye to the fact that babies are going to starve when the SNAP benefits end in just hours from now. Come on.”She went on to criticise what she described as Trump’s obsession with image and excess. “I’m not going to be distracted by, ‘Oh, does the guy have a big f--king hammer?’ What about those babies?” Harris said, drawing a contrast between the lavish project and struggle of low-income families.The MAGA chief's ballroom project is estimated to cost around $300 million and involves tearing down the East Wing of the White House to make way for a 90,000-square-foot hall. The White House has maintained that the expansion is funded entirely by private donors and no taxpayer money is used, but Democrats have denounced it as wasteful and tone-deaf amid the cost-of-living crisis.The shutdown has already jeopardised federal food assistance for nearly 40 million Americans and threatens to raise healthcare costs as subsidies under the Affordable Care Act are set to expire.Harris urged action on behalf of working families, pointing out what she called Trump’s misplaced priorities. “It costs $8 billion to keep SNAP going for poor children? Come on. And taxpayer dollars, by the way,” she said, referencing Trump’s earlier $20 billion bailout to Argentina.","Former vice president went on a furious rant on The Weekly Show with Jon Stewart podcast.

Indian-origin Woman Confronts JD Vance On Wife Usha’s Faith And Trump’s Immigration Crackdown





US vice-president JD Vance ignited a fierce controversy on religious freedom in MAGA-infused America this week after hoping his wife Usha, daughter of practising Hindus, would take up his Christian faith even though he acknowledged she has the “free will” not to.The remarks, made before a large conservative audience at a Turning Point USA event at the University of Mississippi on Wednesday night, sparked a volatile debate on social media about the balance of personal faith and public life in their inter-religious marriage.While Vance's stand drew applause from the conservative youth audience, they triggered a robust backlash from many Indian-American and pro-Hindu commentators, with critics branding it ""Hinduphobic"" pandering to MAGA's Christian nationalist base with an eye on his political future.Taunted by a social media influencer, who wrote “It’s weird to throw your wife’s religion under the bus, in public, for a moment’s acceptance by groypers,” Vance lashed back on Friday. “My wife- is the most amazing blessing I have in my life. She herself encouraged me to reengage with my faith many years ago. She is not a Christian and has no plans to convert, but like many people in an interfaith marriage--or any interfaith relationship--I hope she may one day see things as I do,” he wrote.“Regardless, I'll continue to love and support her and talk to her about faith and life and everything else, because she's my wife,” he added.The spark for the explosive debate came during a question-and-answer session earlier this week when Vance was asked by an Indian-origin student how, among other things, he was making sure his children did not overlook their mother’s Hindu heritage and why immigrants had to embrace Christianity “to be one of you guys” and show that they love America.Vance acknowledged his wife grew up in a Hindu family though he insisted it was not in a particularly religious household, implicitly contradicting his wife (who was not present at the event) who has spoken of her parents and grandparents being observant Hindus. In fact, he asserted, they were both agnostic or atheist when they met, although several photos online show they also got married in a Hindu ceremony. The couple, with their children, also visited the Akshardham Temple during a recent India visit.The Vances have three children, Ewan, Vivek, and Mirabel. Usha’s parents, Radhakrishna “Krish” Chilukuri and Lakshmi Chilukuri, immigrated from Andhra Pradesh, India to the United States in early 1980s.Vance then went on to speak of his own belief in the Christian gospel and said “I hope eventually my wife comes to see it the same way,” while disclosing that their two older children attend a Christian school, and their eight-year-old son recently received his First Communion. He also revealed that Usha attends Mass with him most Sundays, a revelation that triggered much anguish among ardent Hindus who accused him of trying to convert her.Vance though defended his stand of publicly encouraging his wife to embrace his faith. ""Yes, Christians have beliefs. And yes, those beliefs have many consequences, one of which is that we want to share them with other people,"" he wrote.""We hope you may, one day, see that the Bhagavad Gita is the truth,"" one critic on X clapped back snarkily.","US vice-president JD Vance ignited a fierce controversy on religious freedom in MAGA-infused America.

Indian-origin MAGA commentator Dinesh D'souza endorsed Vice President JD Vance's statement on Second Lady Usha Vance's religion and explained that every true Christian wants to share the love of Christ.

Hindu groups condemned JD Vance for distancing himself from his wife's faith though in the past he himself said that his wife's faith helped him reconnect with his faith and he got baptized in 2019. In his controversial statement, Vance also called Usha Vance 'agnostic' though Usha Vance said she belonged to a religious Hindu family.""As I've told her, and I've said publicly, and I'll say now in front of 10,000 of my closest friends: Do I hope eventually that she is somehow moved by the same thing that I was moved by church? Yeah, I honestly do wish that because I believe in the Christian Gospel, and I hope eventually my wife comes to see it the same way.But if she doesn't, then God says everybody has free will, and so that doesn't cause a problem for me,"" JD Vance said making it clear that he spoke about it with Usha as well.Photo of JD Vance and Usha Vance's Hindu marriage, their Indian sartorial choices on several occasions and the very fact that they named one of their sons 'Vivek' -- an Indian Hindu name -- were pointed out as a major discourse took place on how Vance has been deliberately lying only to pander to the Christian MAGA base.Usha Vance's choice of faith is not a matter of speculation as the Second Lady, in a not-so-old interview, clarified that she has no intention of converting to Christianity. But social media debate shed light on similar cases that took place in the past like Bobby Jindal and Nikki Haley.

Why It Matters



Can Trump Actually Do It?



In 2013, Democrats led by Harry Reid scrapped the filibuster for most executive-branch nominees.

In 2017, Republicans under Mitch McConnell extended that change to Supreme Court nominations.





As the US government shutdown drags on, Donald Trump has demanded that Senate Republicans “play their TRUMP CARD” and get rid of the filibuster. But what exactly is this rule, why does it matter, and can a president really make it vanish?In a late-night Truth Social post, President Donald Trump urged Senate Republicans to “end the filibuster,” the rule requiring 60 votes to pass most legislation, to break the deadlock over government funding.Republicans currently control 53 of the 100 Senate seats, short of the 60 needed to overcome Democratic opposition. Trump’s demand revives a long-running Washington debate about whether the Senate’s tradition of extended debate protects democracy or paralyses it.The filibuster is a procedural rule unique to the US Senate that allows a minority of senators to delay or block a bill by continuing debate indefinitely. To end debate and move to a final vote, the Senate must invoke “cloture”, which needs three-fifths of the chamber, or 60 votes.Originally meant to protect the rights of the minority, the filibuster has become a tool of partisan gridlock. Today, senators rarely hold the floor for hours as in the past; simply threatening to filibuster is enough to stall legislation.As a result, most major bills need bipartisan support to pass.Only budget reconciliation bills, which deal with taxes or spending, can bypass the filibuster and pass with a simple majority.Facing a shutdown that has frozen federal programs and threatened health-care subsidies, Trump called on Republicans to “play their TRUMP CARD” and eliminate the filibuster entirely.The president’s message came after Senate Democrats blocked a funding bill, demanding the reinstatement of certain health-insurance subsidies linked to the Affordable Care Act. Republican leaders, including Senate Majority Leader John Thune, have so far resisted calls to change the rule, saying the White House has not formally pressed them to do so.This is not Trump’s first clash with the filibuster. During his first term he also demanded its removal to speed up legislation, but Senate Republicans then, as now, declined to take that step.Getting rid of the filibuster would reshape the Senate and the balance of power in Washington.Short-term effect: Republicans could pass spending bills and other legislation with 51 votes, ending the shutdown without Democratic support.Long-term risk: Once the rule is gone, Democrats could use the same simple-majority standard if they regain control, advancing sweeping policies opposed by conservatives.That is why many senators, including traditionalists in both parties, are wary of what is known as the “nuclear option.” They fear it would destroy the Senate’s character as a deliberative body designed to slow down the legislative process and force consensus.No. The president cannot unilaterally change Senate rules.Under the US Constitution, each chamber of Congress sets its own rules. The only way to eliminate or weaken the filibuster is for a majority of senators to vote for a rule change or to create a new procedural precedent, often referred to as the “nuclear option.”This has been used before:But those moves applied only to appointments, not legislation. Extending the “nuclear option” to all bills would be a much bigger and more controversial step.Given the current numbers, Republicans would need at least 51 votes to make that change. Several GOP senators, including moderates, have expressed opposition, meaning Trump’s call may remain symbolic unless the party unites behind him.What’s NextUnless the rule changes, the 60-vote threshold remains in place, forcing both sides to negotiate a funding compromise to reopen the government.If Republican leaders sense growing political damage from the shutdown, pressure may mount to test the “nuclear option.” But doing so could permanently alter how the Senate works and change how every future president, Democrat or Republican, governs.For now, the filibuster stands: part guardrail, part chokehold, and a reminder that in Washington, breaking the rules is always easier to say than to do.","The filibuster is a procedural rule unique to the US Senate that allows a minority of senators to delay or block a bill by continuing debate indefinitely.

Erika Kirk, widow of MAGA activist Charlie Kirk , made an emotional return to the public stage on Wednesday as she joined vice president JD Vance at a Turning Point USA campus event at the University of Mississippi.It was Erika's first time speaking at the conservative event, since Charlie's assassination seven weeks earlier at Utah Valley University by a fatal sniper shot.Speaking to nearly 10,000 students, Erika talked about courage in the face of tragedy and shared that she had invited Vance to speak at the event.“When our team asked my dear friend, Vice President JD Vance, to speak today, I really prayed on it because, obviously, it’s a very emotional, emotional day,” she said. “But I could just hear Charlie in my heart. I could just hear him say, ‘Go reclaim that territory, babe.’ The battle’s already won. God’s love conquers.

'One Arrow, Two Targets': Indian Navy Sends Subtle Warning Message to China and Pakistan





Pakistan, heavily dependent on the waters of the Indus basin, faces a acute risk of insufficient water storage after India suspended the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) earlier this year, according to the Ecological Threat Report 2025.The report, released by the Institute for Economics and Peace, a Sydney-based independent and non-profit think tank, says the suspension gives India the ability to control the westward flow of the Indus and its tributaries into Pakistan. The move came after India decided to put the treaty in abeyance as a punitive measure following the Pakistan-sponsored Pahalgam terror attack on April 22 this year.This marks a major setback for Pakistan, whose agriculture depends 80 per cent on the Indus River system. The report highlighted that Pakistan’s dams can currently hold only about 30 days of Indus flow, leaving the country highly vulnerable to disruptions.“Pakistan lacks sufficient storage to buffer variations,” the report warned, adding, “If India were truly to cut off or significantly reduce Indus flows, Pakistan’s densely populated plains would face severe water shortages, especially in winter and dry seasons.Indeed, about 80 per cent of Pakistan’s irrigated agriculture depends on Indus basin rivers.”While India’s infrastructure limits its ability to completely stop river flows, even small disruptions could have ""disastrous"" short-term effects on Pakistan’s farm sector.In May, India carried out “reservoir flushing” operations at the Salal and Baglihar dams on the Chenab River without notifying Pakistan. This process, used to remove silt by draining reservoirs, had been restricted under the treaty due to the risk of sudden downstream changes.The impact was immediate: parts of the Chenab River in Pakistan’s Punjab ran dry for several days when India shut the dam gates and later released sediment-filled torrents upon reopening them.The Indus Waters Treaty, signed in 1960 and mediated by the World Bank, has long acted as a key tool for water-sharing and conflict resolution between the two countries. It governs the use of the Indus River and its six major tributaries -- five on the left bank and one on the right.","India suspended the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) earlier this year.

Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan’s (TTP) second-in-command Amjad, a key figure in the banned militant group, was killed along with three other militants when security forces foiled an infiltration attempt from Afghanistan into Pakistan, the army said on Thursday.According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), cited by PTI, the militants tried to cross the Pakistan-Afghanistan border in Bajaur district on Wednesday night when their movement was detected.“The troops effectively engaged and thwarted the militants' attempt to infiltrate,” the statement said, adding that four militants, including high-value target Amjad alias Mazahim, were “sent to hell.”Amjad, who served as deputy to TTP chief Noor Wali and headed the group’s Rehbari Shura, was among Pakistan’s most wanted militants, carrying a bounty of Rs five million. The ISPR said he was “actively involved in perpetuating numerous terrorist activities inside Pakistan while residing in Afghanistan.”The army also urged the interim Afghan government to take “concrete measures to ensure that Afghan soil is not used by militants to perpetrate terrorism against Pakistan.”Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif lauded the security forces for eliminating the TTP commander and his aides. Prime Minister Shehbaz said the security forces, through their professional expertise, eliminated the highly wanted TTP commander Amjad and thwarted “the nefarious designs of the enemies of Pakistan's sovereignty.” He added, “We will continue to defeat the elements that harm innocent people. ”The operation in Bajaur came a day after six Pakistani soldiers, including a captain, were martyred during an intelligence-based operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Kurram district, where seven terrorists were also gunned down.Formed in 2007 as an umbrella organisation of several militant outfits, the TTP seeks to impose its strict version of Islam across Pakistan.

'Pakistan’s patience has run its course'



Growing tensions on the border







Pakistan has admitted to having an agreement with the United States that allows the use of drones within its territory, TOLOnews reported, citing Afghan and diplomatic sources. The acknowledgment, made during the latest round of Pakistan-Afghanistan peace talks in Turkey.According to TOLOnews, the Pakistani delegation said it “cannot break” the agreement with Washington that authorises drone operations. Afghan negotiators, in response, demanded written guarantees that Pakistan would not allow US drones to use its airspace or strike Afghan territory. Sources familiar with the talks, cited by TOLOnews said Pakistan’s delegation initially agreed to these conditions but later reversed its position after receiving instructions from Islamabad, saying it had “no control over US drones and could not ensure action against ISIS. ” Qatari and Turkish mediators were reportedly taken aback by the sudden shift in stance.The Afghan side reiterated that the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) issue was Pakistan’s own internal problem. “The Islamic Emirate has repeatedly emphasised, and again reaffirmed, that insecurity in Pakistan is a domestic matter,” TOLOnews quoted its delegation as saying, adding that Afghanistan remains committed to ensuring no group uses its soil to harm other nations.The disclosure came as four days of talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan in Istanbul collapsed without agreement. Pakistan’s information minister Attaullah Tarar said the dialogue “failed to bring about any workable solution,” blaming Kabul for refusing to act against militants responsible for cross-border attacks. “Pakistan’s patience has run its course,” Tarar said, adding that Islamabad “would continue to take all possible measures necessary to protect our people from terrorism. ”Pakistani Defence Minister Khawaja Asif issued a strong warning to the Taliban regime, vowing that Islamabad could “strike deep into Afghanistan” if further attacks occurred. “If their territory is used and they violate ours, we will retaliate — we surely will,” Asif told reporters. In a separate post on X, he cautioned Kabul against testing Pakistan’s “resolve and capabilities at its own peril and doom.”The breakdown in talks follows weeks of escalating border clashes that left dozens dead. Pakistan’s military earlier this month struck what it described as TTP hideouts inside Afghanistan, prompting retaliatory attacks that killed Pakistani soldiers. Though a ceasefire brokered by Qatar on 19 October remains technically in effect, all major crossings between the two countries remain closed, with hundreds of trucks stranded.Islamabad insists that the Afghan Taliban continues to shelter militants who launch attacks in Pakistan, a charge Kabul denies. The UN has expressed concern over the failed negotiations, urging both sides to avoid renewed fighting.","Pakistan has admitted to having an agreement with the United States that allows the use of drones within its territory, TOLOnews reported.

Escalation Fears Mount As Pakistan-Afghanistan Talks End Without Conclusion In Turkey

Operation Sindoor







Days after Jaish-e-Mohammed announced the formation of its first-ever women's wing, 'Jamaat-ul-Mominaat', the JeM's chief Masood Azhar has released a 21-minute audio message from group's Bahawalpur headquarters, Markaz Usman o Ali, outlining a detailed plan for training, indoctrinating, and deploying women under the new unit, as local media reported.According to media reports, in the audio, Azhar explains how women will be recruited, trained, and integrated into his long-term ""global jihad"" mission, mirroring the structure of JeM's long-running male training programme.Azhar declares that just as men undergo the 15-day ""Daura-e-Tarbiat"" course, women joining 'Jamaat-ul-Mominaat' will be trained through an induction course named ""Daura-e-Taskiya"", conducted at Markaz Usman o Ali in Bahawalpur.For the past two decades, JeM's ""Daura-e-Tarbiat"" has served as the primary indoctrination stage for male recruits, convincing them that jihad against India guarantees paradise. Azhar now intends to extend the same ideological training to women.In his speech, the wanted terrorist promises that any woman who joins Jamaat-ul-Mominaat “will go straight to paradise from her grave after death.”He added that women completing the first course will advance to a second stage, ""Daura-Ayat-ul-Nisah,"" which will teach how Islamic texts ""instruct women to conduct jihad.""Justifying the formation of a female brigade, most-wanted terrorist Azhar claimed, ""The enemies of Jaish have put Hindu women into the army and set up female journalists against us,"" declaring that he is ""mobilising his women to compete and fight against them.""He asserts that JeM’s male Mujahids will work alongside this new female unit, saying the women’s brigade will ""spread Islam across the world.""Azhar also announces that Jamaat-ul-Mominaat branches will be opened in every district of Pakistan , each headed by a District Muntazima responsible for recruiting local women. He lays down strict communication rules, stating, ""Women joining the brigade must not speak to any unrelated men through phone or messenger, except their husbands or immediate family members.""According to IANS, the women’s wing will be led by Sadiya Azhar, sister of Masood Azhar. Her husband, Yusuf Azhar, was killed during Operation Sindoor on May 7, when Indian forces targeted JeM’s previous base, Markaz Subhanallah.""His other sister Samaira Azhar, and Afeera Farooq, widow of Pulwama attacker Umar Farooq, are also part of the leadership,"" sources confirmed, adding that “they are tasked with conducting daily online sessions to motivate and recruit women.”JeM has since verified these details in a new poster naming Umme Masood (real name Samaira Azhar) as the instructor for online classes, conducted five days a week from October 25.Azhar further reveals that Jamaat-ul-Mominaat includes “4–5 women whose male relatives were killed in encounters with the Indian Army,” who will inspire new recruits under a campaign called “Shoba-e-Dawat.”He urges women cadres to read his book “Ae Musalman Behna” (O Muslim Sister) as part of their indoctrination.It is significant that 14 members of Masood Azhar’s family were killed in India’s Operation Sindoor, including Yousuf Azhar, Jameel Ahmed, Hamza Jameel, and Huzaifa Azhar. Azhar now claims that his elder sister Hawa Bibi also died in the same strike.In the audio, an emotional Azhar recounts that he had conceptualised the idea of a women’s brigade with his sister before her death.In retaliation for the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir, which claimed the lives of 26 civilians, India launched a major military operation targeting Pakistan-based terror infrastructure. The counterterror action, named Operation Sindoor, struck nine key terror hubs across Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.The strikes destroyed major bases of Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), including their headquarters in Bahawalpur and Muridke, which were reduced to rubble by precision airstrikes carried out by the Indian armed forces.In response, Pakistan attempted retaliation by launching multiple drones and missiles towards Indian territory the following night. However, India’s advanced air defence systems swiftly intercepted and neutralised the incoming threats, preventing any casualties or damage.India then answered this provocation with targeted strikes on crucial Pakistani airbases, including the strategically significant Nur Khan Airbase and Rahim Yar Khan Airbase.The heightened military tensions between the two neighbours were eventually de-escalated following a mutual peace agreement, initiated by Pakistan’s Director General of Military Operations (DGMO).Since then, these outfits have reportedly relocated to Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) region to avoid further strikes. Their leaders have been issuing propaganda messages and appeals for funds to rebuild their networks.Media sources also reveal that Masood Azhar has been aggressively collecting donations. During his September 27 address at Markaz Usman o Ali, he publicly appealed for financial support.JeM is now collecting a donation of 500 PKR from every woman enrolling in the new course and requiring them to fill out online registration forms.Earlier, on October 8, Masood Azhar formally announced the formation of Jamaat-ul-Mominaat, followed by an event titled “Dukhtaran-e-Islam” in Rawalakot, PoK, on October 19, aimed at drawing women into the organisation.While groups like ISIS, Boko Haram, Hamas, and LTTE have long deployed women in combat and suicide missions, organisations such as JeM, LeT, and Hizbul Mujahideen had largely avoided such practices -- until now. Security agencies believe JeM’s latest move signals its intent to train and deploy female suicide bombers in future terror operations.","Jaish-e-Mohammed announces formation of women's wing, 'Jamaat-ul-Mominaat' JeM's chief Masood Azhar releases 21-minute audio message from group's Bahawalpur headquarters, Markaz Usman o Ali.

What Afghanistan said







Pakistan has issued a stark warning to the Taliban regime in Afghanistan after the peace talks in Turkey failed to bear any outcome on Tuesday. Boasting Pakistan's defence arsenal, its Pakwarned that ""not require to employ even a fraction of its full arsenal to completely obliterate the Taliban regime and push them back to the caves for hiding. ""“Let me assure them that Pakistan does not require to employ even a fraction of its full arsenal to completely obliterate the Taliban regime and push them back to the caves for hiding. If they wish so, the repeat of the scenes of their rout at Tora Bora, with their tails between the legs, would surely be a spectacle to watch for the people of the region,” Dawn reported Asif saying.Kabul has blamed Pakistan for the failed peace talks in Turkey after Islamabad disagreed ""to stop violating Afghan airspace and prevent US drone flights,"" Tolo News reported citing sources.The violence, which left more than 70 people dead and wounded hundreds more, erupted after a series of explosions in Kabul on October 9, attacks that Taliban authorities have attributed to Pakistan. The two sides had been engaged in peace talks in Istanbul at the time.Pakistan information minister Attaullah Tarar on Wednesday informed in a post on X that the talks between the two nations had no conclusion as the ""Afghan side gave no assurances, kept deviating from the core issue.""""Regrettably, the Afghan side gave no assurances, kept deviating from the core issue and resorted to blame game, deflection and ruses,"" AFP quoted Tarar saying. ""The dialogue thus failed to bring about any workable solution.""Adding to this, Asif took a more firm stance warning Afghanistan against any ""terrorist attack or any suicide bombing inside Pakistan"".“We have borne your treachery and mockery for too long, but no more. Any terrorist attack or any suicide bombing inside Pakistan shall give you the bitter taste of such misadventures. Be rest assured and test our resolve and capabilities, if you wish so, at your own peril and doom,” Dawn quoted Asif saying.Though there has been no direct statements from Kabul's side, media reports stated that the talks broke down as ""Pakistani delegation reportedly presented demands that were also unacceptable to both sides.""According to Tolo News, sources said Islamabad pressed the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan to formally classify the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) as a terrorist organization and to act against the group.Reacting to this, Afghanistan defence minister Mawlawi Mohammad Yaqoob Mujahid, said, “Pakistan and other countries use the label of terrorism for political purposes against their opponents.”However, a Pakistani security source said the Afghan delegation initially agreed to act decisively against the TTP but repeatedly backtracked under instructions from Kabul, AFP reported.Following the October 9 Kabul explosions, the Taliban launched a border offensive—prompting Pakistani strikes in response. A 48-hour ceasefire collapsed before a new truce was reached on October 19 in Doha, with Qatar and Turkey mediating. The border has now been shut for over two weeks, allowing only expelled Afghans to cross, leaving goods stranded and spoiling in places like Spin Boldak.","Kabul has blamed Pakistan for the failed peace talks in Turkey after Islamabad disagreed ""to stop violating Afghan airspace and prevent US drone flights,"" Tolo News reported citing sources.

Pakistan's defence minister Khawaja Asif on Tuesday warned Afghanistan that if the attack on Islamabad continues, then they will give a 50 times stronger response, and accused Kabul of acting as a puppet for India.The remarks came after peace talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan in Istanbul dramatically collapsed.Speaking on Geo News programme ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada ke Saath’, Asif Kabul, using Pakistan’s familiar playbook of deflection, claimed that Kabul was merely a puppet in India’s hands.He said “I would compliment their delegation, but the people in Kabul pulling the strings and staging the puppet show are being controlled by Delhi.""""India is compensating for its defeat on their western border through Kabul. The junta there (in Afghanistan) has elements that have visited India and visited their temples,"" Asif claimed. ""India wants to engage in a low-intensity war with Pakistan. To achieve this, they are using Kabul,"" he added.When asked to comment on threats by Afghanistan that they would “attack Islamabad” in the event of further hostilities, Asif replied: “If Afghanistan even looks at Islamabad, we will gouge their eyes out.“They can employ the use of terrorists and they already are. Over the past four years, they have been using terrorists,” he added.“There should be no doubt that Kabul is responsible for the terrorism in Pakistan. Kabul is a tool for Delhi. If they want to, God forbid, attack Islamabad, we will give a befitting response. A response 50 times stronger,” the defence minister said.Kabul had previously rejected Islamabad’s accusations as unfounded.Still, the Pakistani minister praised the Afghan negotiators for their cooperation — even as he directed sharp criticism at the Kabul leadership.This is not the first time. Earlier also, Pakistan claimed India was behind a recent assault in Afghanistan. Ministry of external affairs dismissed Pakistan’s accusations that India was behind a recent assault in Afghanistan, saying Islamabad’s record of harbouring terrorism was well knownAt the weekly press briefing, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, “Three things are clear. One, Pakistan hosts terrorist organisations and sponsors terrorist activities. Two, it is an old practice of Pakistan to blame its neighbours for its own internal failures. Three, Pakistan is infuriated with Afghanistan exercising sovereignty over its own territories.""The remarks followed the collapse of the latest round of peace talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan in Turkey. According to Afghan and Pakistani sources cited by Reuters, both sides had earlier agreed to a ceasefire on October 19 in Doha but failed to make progress in Istanbul.Each country blamed the other for the stalemate. The discussions, mediated by Turkey and Qatar, concluded on Monday without any breakthrough.","Pakistan's defence minister Khawaja Asif warned Afghanistan that if the attack on Islamabad continues, then they will give a 50 times stronger response.

Afghanistan Stops Border Operations Against Pakistan Following Mediation By Gulf Countries





Negotiations between Afghanistan and Pakistan to secure a lasting truce after their bloodiest clashes in years were deadlocked Tuesday, with a Pakistani security source saying a ""last-ditch effort"" was under way. Dozens were killed on both sides of the border in the worst such violence since the Taliban returned to power in 2021.The one-time allies have had frosty relations since then, with the Taliban govt denying accusations from Islamabad that it harbours militant groups which stage attacks in Pakistan. After an initial 48-hour ceasefire between the neighbours lapsed, a second truce emerged on Oct 19 after talks in Doha, mediated by Qatar and Turkiye, though its terms remain unclear. Talks in Istanbul began Saturday and aimed to establish long-term peace.A Pakistani security source said the Afghan Taliban delegation initially agreed to Islamabad's call for ""credible and decisive action"" against the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan militant group. But the Afghan side ""reversed its position repeatedly after instructions from Kabul"", said the source, who was not authorised to discuss the peace talks publicly.Pakistan's defence minister Khawaja Asif had warned on Saturday that failure to reach a deal could lead to ""open war"". Abdul Mateen Qani, spokesman for Afghanistan's interior ministry, said that any attack would be met with a response ""that will serve as a lesson for Pakistan and a message for others"".","Dozens killed on both sides of the border in the worst such violence since the Taliban returned to power in 2021.

In a rare confession, Pakistan has admitted to having an agreement with a ""foreign country"" which allowed it to carry drone strikes on Afghanistan soil, Tolo News reported citing source. It has sought retreat from the Turkey talks asking the Afghan side to ""accept that Pakistan has the right to carry out attacks on Afghan soil during TTP assaults. ""The report, however, did not reveal the ""foreign country"" under question.It further said that because of the agreement, Pakistan ""cannot prevent such strikes because breaking the agreement is not possible.""According to the report, the source claimed there was a lack of coordination within the Pakistani delegation, suggesting that rather than putting forward a coherent case, they seemed more inclined to backtrack and walk away from the talks.The Islamic Emirate’s delegation has argued that the TTP matter is Pakistan’s own longstanding internal issue, not something that concerns Afghanistan.This came after reports suggested that there was a deadlock in the Pakistan-Afghanistan truce talks with both the nations blaming each other for failure to reach a deal.There has been no official comment about the status of the talks.","Pakistan has admitted to having an agreement with a ""foreign country"" which allowed it to carry drone strikes on Afghanistan soil.

Twin Trouble For Pak! After India, Afghanistan May Restrict River Water Supply To Pakistan

Pak, Afghan play the blame game







Pakistan, Afghanistan peace talks in Turkey have hit an impasse with both the nations pointing fingers at each other for failure to reach a deal, the Associated Press reported on Tuesday. Istanbul has been consistent in its efforts to end the deadlock, however, there has been no immediate confirmations whether a fourth day of talks would be held.The Istanbul talks form a key element of a wider diplomatic effort to defuse months of rising friction between Islamabad and Kabul over cross-border militancy and alleged safe havens, long-standing flashpoints that have only intensified since the Taliban reclaimed power in Afghanistan four years ago.There has been no official statement about the status of the talks.Pakistan and Afghanistan have blamed each other for the deadlock, as efforts to build on last month’s ceasefire remain stalled. Both sides accused the other of lacking seriousness in talks aimed at easing cross-border tensions that recently erupted into deadly clashes.Pakistani security officials involved in the negotiations said Kabul was refusing to accept what Islamabad considers “logical and legitimate” demands -- assurances that Afghan soil would not be used for attacks in Pakistan, according to AP.They argued that the Taliban delegation had been reluctant to commit to concrete guarantees and repeatedly sought guidance from Kabul before making decisions.The Afghan side, however, countered those claims. While Kabul did not immediately issue a formal response, state-run broadcaster RTA asserted that Afghanistan has “made every effort to hold constructive talks,” but that “the Pakistani side does not seem to have this intention.” The accusation mirrors Pakistan’s criticism and underscores a widening diplomatic rift.Despite the stalemate, Turkish officials and other international mediators have been working to preserve the ceasefire brokered in Doha on October 19, after fighting along the border left dozens of soldiers, militants and civilians dead on both sides.","Pakistan and Afghanistan have blamed each other for the deadlock, as efforts to build on last month’s ceasefire remain stalled.

Should India Engage With Taliban Amid Pak-Afghan Truce? Ex-Diplomat Explains| India Connect





The latest round of peace talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan has reportedly hit a stalemate, with Islamabad accusing the Afghan Taliban of taking an “illogical and detached” position on key security issues, including cooperation against cross-border militancy, Geo News reported.The second phase of discussions, held in Istanbul on Saturday, came a week after the initial negotiations in Doha following an October 16 ceasefire that ended the deadliest border clashes between the two sides since the Taliban seized power in 2021.Citing official sources, Geo News said Pakistan presented “clear, evidence-based and solution-oriented” demands urging Kabul to act against militant groups operating from Afghan soil. However, the Taliban delegation allegedly remained “unwilling to cooperate or acknowledge ground realities.”The talks in Istanbul, mediated by Turkey’s intelligence chief Ibrahim Kalin, focused on creating a joint monitoring mechanism to curb militant movement across the border and facilitate smoother trade. Radio Pakistan reported that both sides also discussed the possibility of a long-term political framework to stabilise relations.According to reports, Turkey is attempting to bridge the gap by helping the Taliban delegation understand the seriousness of Pakistan’s security concerns. Islamabad has reportedly conveyed its final position, warning that any tolerance or shelter for militants targeting its territory “will not be acceptable.”Sources told Geo News that progress in the talks now hinges entirely on the Taliban’s attitude and readiness to cooperate in good faith. Pakistani officials described the Taliban’s responses during the exchanges as “illogical and detached from ground realities,” further deepening doubts about Kabul’s sincerity.During the discussions, Pakistan pressed the Taliban regime to dismantle terrorist networks and prevent militant infiltration. Kabul’s delegation submitted a written response to Islamabad’s proposals late Sunday night.The ongoing negotiations mark the second round of peace efforts, following the Doha talks where both sides agreed to a ceasefire mediated by Qatar and Turkey after intense cross-border clashes.The conflict saw multiple days of heavy clashes across the border of two neighbours. Pakistani forces claimed they killed over 200 Taliban fighters, while 23 soldiers lost their lives, according to media reports. Following the violence, key border crossings were shut, citing security concerns.Meanwhile, Pakistani defence minister Khawaja Asif has warned of an “all-out war” if the peace efforts fail.","The latest round of peace talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan has reportedly hit a stalemate.

She claimed that remaining in Bangladesh, which was battling widespread protests against Hasina, would have endangered her life and the ""safety of those around her"".“Staying would not only have put my life in danger, but also the lives of those around me,"" she said, speaking in an exclusive interview with The Independent.Despite fleeing the country and the Awami League being banned in Bangladesh, she maintains that she is still committed to “restoring democracy” in the country.Hasina described the August protests in Bangladesh as a “violent insurrection.”“As a leader, I ultimately take leadership responsibility, but the claim that I ordered or wished for the security forces to open fire on the crowds is simply wrong,"" she said.She added that she blames the high number of casualties on “breakdowns in discipline among security forces on the ground.” Hasina said her government had launched an independent inquiry into the initial killings, which was later shut down by the interim administration that replaced her.She said that she would “neither be surprised nor intimidated” if Bangladesh’s International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) sentenced her to death, calling the proceedings “a sham trial” motivated by political revenge.“The ICT is a sham court presided over by an unelected government consisting of my political opponents. Many of those opponents will stop at nothing to get rid of me,"" Hasina said, as cited by The Independent.What began last July as a movement by university students demanding the removal of job quotas for relatives of independence war veterans soon grew into a nationwide uprising in Bangladesh, which ultimately led to Hasina fleeing the country.Hasina disputed the widely reported death toll from the student-led protests, saying that “the 1,400 figure is useful to the ICT for propaganda purposes but is probably inflated.”Meanwhile, the interim government's chief prosecutor, Tajul Islam, has called Hasina the “mastermind and principal architect” behind the alleged crimes against humanity during the student-led uprising.","Ousted Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has said she fled the country on August 5 last year “out of necessity” She claimed that remaining in Bangladesh, which was battling widespread protests against Hasina, would have endangered her life and the ""safety of those around her"" Hasina described the August protests in Bangladesh as a “violent insurrection”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124988908,imgsize-637906,width-400,resizemode-4/sheikh-hasina-ani.jpg"

Afghanistan’s interior minister Sirajuddin Haqqani has issued a stern warning to Pakistan, saying Kabul’s patience should not be mistaken for weakness as both sides agreed to maintain a fragile ceasefire after days of failed negotiations.Haqqani warned that if Afghanistan’s patience was tested again, the country would deliver a “crushing” response. “Defending our territory is among our priorities,” he said. “Yet despite all this, the path of understanding remains open. But if someone commits aggression, we have fought the emperors of the world and it is no difficulty for us to defend our territory,” the interior minister said as quoted by TOLOnews.Haqqani added that Afghanistan may lack long-range missiles or heavy weapons but has “strong resolve and determination in the battle against aggression.” Without naming Pakistan, he accused some nations of violating the sovereignty of others “to preserve their interests.” “Afghans have proved themselves in the battlefield,” he warned. “If our patience is tested again, our response will be very crushing,” he said, as per TOLOnews.His comments came soon after Turkey announced that Pakistan and Afghanistan had agreed to uphold a ceasefire following days of tense talks in Istanbul, mediated by Turkey and Qatar. The ceasefire deal, confirmed on Thursday, aims to prevent further border clashes that have recently left dozens of soldiers and civilians dead. The two sides are set to reconvene in Istanbul on November 6 to finalise a monitoring and verification mechanism, including penalties for any violation of the agreement.Despite the progress, the border remains shut, with hundreds of trucks and refugees stranded on both sides.

Pakistani officials reiterated that their main demand was for Afghanistan to take “clear, verifiable and effective action” against militant groups operating on its soil.Tensions spiked earlier this month when Kabul accused Pakistan of launching airstrikes inside Afghanistan, including one that hit a market in the east.

NEW DELHI: Ousted Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Wednesday said she lives freely in New Delhi, and “would love to go home” but remains cautious, given her family’s violent past.“I would of course love to go home, so long as the government there was legitimate, the constitution was being upheld, and law and order genuinely prevailed,” Hasina told Reuters in her first media engagement after her dramatic fall from power last year.The 78-year-old Awami League chief fled to India in August 2024 after a deadly student-led uprising ended her 15-year rule. An interim government led by Muhammad Yunus has ruled Bangladesh since Hasina’s ouster and has promised to hold elections in February 2026.Sitting in the Indian capital, Hasina said she won’t return to Bangladesh under any government formed through elections that exclude her party.Hasina further warned that millions of Awami League supporters would boycott next year’s national election, after the party was barred from contesting the polls.“The ban on the Awami League is not only unjust, it is self-defeating,” she said in emailed responses to Reuters.“The next government must have electoral legitimacy. Millions of people support the Awami League, so as things stand, they will not vote. You cannot disenfranchise millions of people if you want a political system that works,” she added.Once praised for transforming Bangladesh’s economy, Hasina now faces charges of crimes against humanity over a brutal crackdown on student protests in mid-2024.A verdict from the International Crimes Tribunal is expected on November 13, Reuters reported.A United Nations report estimates that up to 1,400 people were killed and thousands more injured, mostly by security forces’ gunfire, during the unrest between July 15 and August 5, marking Bangladesh’s deadliest violence since the 1971 war of independence.“These proceedings are a politically motivated charade,” Hasina said, denying the allegations. “They’ve been brought by kangaroo courts, with guilty verdicts a foregone conclusion. I was mostly denied prior notice or any meaningful opportunity to defend myself,” she added.Despite her exile, Hasina remains hopeful about her party’s future.“It’s really not about me or my family,” she said. “For Bangladesh to achieve the future we all want, there must be a return to constitutional rule and political stability. No single person or family defines our country’s future.”",Ousted Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina says she lives freely in New Delhi.

India-Bangladesh trade tensions :







Pakistan has granted Bangladesh access to Karachi Port in an effort to revitalize bilateral trade, marking a notable outcome of the 9th Pak–Bangladesh Joint Economic Commission (JEC) meeting -- the first such dialogue in two decades. The development arrives at a sensitive moment, as Dhaka’s relations with New Delhi grow increasingly strained following the fall of the Sheikh Hasina regime.According to the Pakistani news outlet Samaa TV, the port access would allow Dhaka to expand its trade network with China and Central Asian countries.According to the official statement, the two sides emphasized stronger cooperation between their national shipping lines, the news outlet reported.Pakistan’s decision to open Karachi Port to Bangladeshi vessels is expected to streamline trade routes for Dhaka, while also expanding opportunities for commercial engagement across regional and neighboring markets.Trade tensions between India and Bangladesh have been rising, with New Delhi imposing a series of restrictions on Dhaka’s exports this year. Most recently, India banned the import of select jute products and ropes from Bangladesh via all land routes, requiring shipments to be rerouted through the Nhava Sheva seaport in Maharashtra.These measures follow multiple earlier curbs that limited a wide range of Bangladeshi goods, including garments, processed foods, and jute fabrics, to seaborne entry only. India also withdrew a key transshipment facility in April, further tightening trade access and signaling a deepening strain in bilateral commercial ties.The latest trade curbs unfold amid heightened political friction, following comments made in China by Bangladesh’s interim government chief Muhammad Yunus that sparked sharp criticism across India’s political spectrum. Ties have also deteriorated over Dhaka’s inability to prevent rising violence against minorities, particularly the Hindu community.","Pakistan has granted Bangladesh access to Karachi Port in an effort to revitalize bilateral trade.

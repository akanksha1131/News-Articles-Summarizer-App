And the woman was very violent. She's a very radical person. Very sad what happened. Her friend was very radical,"" Trump said.""You can't be treating law enforcement that way, whether it's ICE or Border Patrol or our police and men and women. You can't do that,"" he added.The US President also took a sharp jibe at his predecessor Joe Biden, accusing him of allowing people to pour through an open border.""You know, the law enforcement our country is doing really well despite the fact that Sleepy Joe Biden allowed people to pour through an open border. Crime stats just came out. We have the best crime stats on record, despite all the criminals he allowed into our country. We've gotten a lot of them out,"" Trump said.""We have to respect our law enforcement at a very minimum.

Iran Street Fire: 500+ Killed, Say Activists As Tehran Blames Israel & U.S. For Unrest | WATCH





Several supporters of Iran’s exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi were injured on Sunday after a U-Haul truck drove into a crowd during a protest in Los Angeles, triggering chaos and clashes near a federal building in the city’s Westwood neighbourhood.The incident occurred as several hundred demonstrators had gathered to express solidarity with anti-government protests in Iran and oppose the country’s clerical leadership. The rally was part of growing global demonstrations backing protesters inside Iran, where unrest has intensified in recent weeks.According to ABC7 news, a U-Haul box truck drove down a street crowded with marchers, forcing protesters to scramble out of the way. Witnesses said demonstrators then ran after the speeding vehicle and attempted to stop the driver. The truck was later found several blocks away, surrounded by police vehicles, with its side mirrors shattered.A banner on the truck read: “NO SHAH. NO REGIME. USA: DON’T REPEAT 1953. NO MULLAH.” Several protesters were seen tearing signs off the vehicle.According to the video, demonstrators swarmed the truck, punched the driver and used flagpoles to break through the driver’s side window.Shattered glass and debris were scattered across the area as police worked to contain the crowd, ABC7 News reported.Los Angeles police confirmed officers responded to the scene but did not immediately say whether any arrests were made. The Los Angeles Fire Department said two people were evaluated by paramedics but both declined medical treatment. No ambulances were called.""We can confirm that a U-Haul truck plowed through a group of protesters this afternoon. We are still gathering information and do not have the number of injuries as of now,"" LA police department said.Chaos intensified shortly before 3.30 pm when crowds surrounded the U-Haul. Eyewitnesses reported that some protesters smashed the truck’s windows as tensions escalated. Eventually, the crowd pulled a man from the vehicle and law enforcement appeared to take him into custody. As officers escorted him away, some protesters attempted to punch him and strike him with flagpoles.Later, LAPD issued a dispersal order. By around 5 pm, the crowd disappeared, with only about 100 protesters remaining at the scene. The U-Haul was later seen stationary, surrounded by crime scene tape, broken glass and debris.Protesters again flooded the streets of Tehran and Iran’s second-largest city on Sunday, despite a government-imposed internet blackout aimed at limiting the flow of information.Human rights groups estimate that more than 580 people have been killed and over 10,600 detained since the unrest began. Iranian authorities have not released official figures, according to USA Today.The protests initially began in late December over economic hardship but quickly expanded into broader anti-government demonstrations. Iran’s economy has been under severe strain, with the national currency collapsing, inflation hovering around 40%, and prices rising sharply for basic goods such as meat and rice.The unrest has also been fueled by anger over past crackdowns, including the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini in police custody, which triggered nationwide protests.Some demonstrators in Iran have chanted slogans in support of Reza Pahlavi, the son of Iran’s last shah, who has repeatedly called for protests. Earlier, Pahlavi urged Iranian security forces and government employees to side with demonstrators.“Employees of state institutions, as well as members of the armed and security forces, have a choice: stand with the people and become allies of the nation, or choose complicity with the murderers of the people,” Pahlavi wrote on social media.The violence in Los Angeles comes as tensions surrounding Iran’s protests draw increasing international attention, with US President Donald Trump warning Tehran against violently suppressing peaceful demonstrators.“We’re watching it very closely,” Trump has said. “If they start killing people like they have in the past, I think they’re going to get hit very hard by the United States.”",Several supporters of Iran's exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi were injured on Sunday after a U-Haul truck drove into a crowd during a protest in Los Angeles.

""Speed Does Africa""

White Speed shows up in Kenya despite warnings from Speed’s team





IShowSpeed was once again stunned and confused during his Africa tour when a familiar face appeared unexpectedly. A viral clip from his Kenya livestream shows the popular streamer clearly at a loss for words after seeing White Speed, the well-known stream sniper, appear despite earlier warnings from management. The moment went viral across social media as fans reacted to Speed's dumbfounded expression and awkward silence. The incident occurred on January 11, 2026, during Speed's visit to Kenya, where hordes of people flocked to witness him streaming in public.The Kenya stream was part of the widely followedtour by IShowSpeed, which has already drawn huge attention across multiple countries. His Nairobi livestream attracted over 200,000 live viewers and even caused traffic disruptions as fans filled the streets. While the tour has been praised for its energy and fan engagement, the unexpected return of White Speed added a chaotic twist. Speed's team had previously warned the stream sniper to stop following him, making the Kenya appearance all that more surprising.White Speed, also known online as Gooonki or Tiki Wackowski, first caught attention during Speed’s South Africa streams. He is known for closely copying Speed’s behavior, outfits, and expressions, often appearing suddenly in public streams.According to past clips, White Speed has claimed that he spent all his money traveling just to follow Speed across locations. His actions have divided viewers, with some finding the situation funny and others calling it concerning.In the Kenya stream, Speed’s reaction portrayed him as being uncertain about what to do with the situation. Speed was told to steer clear of White Speed, just like in the past occurrences that triggered the security team to intervene. In the past, there was one instance that involved White Speed hanging on top of a building in South Africa. In the Kenya experience, Speed did not get involved with White Speed.Despite the disruption, the audience was still caught up in the unpredictability of Speed’s live streaming. While some laughed at the level at which White Speed had escalated, others showed support for Speed’s side for attempting to maintain the parameters. This video also contributed to the experience of live streaming on public platforms, especially when the live streamer’s actions can be so easily followed.As IShowSpeed continues his journey in Africa, the Kenya event is a reminder of the dangers that may be involved in these public streams. As for whether White Speed will make an appearance, that remains uncertain. For now, the event continues Speed’s long journey that has included some entertaining moments in Africa.Also Read: MrBeast celebrates Beast Games season 2 hitting #1 in the USA","White Speed, the well-known stream sniper, appeared unexpectedly during IShowSpeed's Africa tour.

Warning to ISIS

Palmyra attack and escalating response

Tensions flare in Aleppo

US role and ongoing mission





The United States carried out “large-scale” retaliatory strikes against Islamic State targets across Syria on Sunday, following last month’s ambush near Palmyra that killed two US soldiers and an American civilian interpreter.US Central Command said the strikes began around 12.30 pm ET and were conducted alongside partner forces, hitting multiple ISIS targets across the country. A US official told CNN that more than 90 precision munitions were fired using more than two dozen aircraft.Saturday’s strikes are part of Operation Hawkeye Strike, the Trump administration’s response to the December attack that killed Sgt. Edgar Brian Torres-Tovar, Sgt. William Nathaniel Howard, and civilian interpreter Ayad Mansoor Sakat while they were supporting Operation Inherent Resolve, the US-led mission to defeat ISIS.US Central Command said the strikes were aimed at preventing future attacks and degrading ISIS’s remaining capabilities in Syria.“The strikes today targeted ISIS throughout Syria as part of our ongoing commitment to root out Islamic terrorism against our warfighters, prevent future attacks, and protect American and partner forces in the region,” the command said in a statement on X.“Our message remains strong: if you harm our warfighters, we will find you and kill you anywhere in the world, no matter how hard you try to evade justice,” US Central Command said.The December ambush marked the first deadly attack on US personnel in Syria since the overthrow of longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad in December 2024. Torres-Tovar, 25, of Des Moines, Iowa, and Howard, 29, of Marshalltown, were members of the Iowa National Guard. Three other Guard members were injured.Operation Hawkeye Strike was launched on December 19 with a large-scale operation that hit roughly 70 ISIS targets across central Syria. The United States and Jordan also carried out a previous round of strikes under the same operation last month.A day before Saturday’s strikes, Syrian officials said their security forces had arrested the military leader of ISIS’s operations in the Levant.Saturday also saw intense clashes in northern Syria’s Aleppo city, where Syrian government forces deployed in the Kurdish-majority Sheikh Maqsoud neighborhood after days of fighting with Kurdish fighters that left dozens dead and wounded.According to Syria’s state news agency SANA, two Kurdish fighters blew themselves up while surrounded by security forces, causing no casualties. Gunfire was reportedly still heard around noon as security forces urged residents to stay indoors. Later in the day, an explosive drone struck the Aleppo Governorate building shortly after a press conference by two Cabinet ministers and a local official.The clashes began Tuesday in Sheikh Maqsoud, Achrafieh, and Bani Zaid after negotiations between the government and the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) stalled over integrating Kurdish forces into the national army. Government forces have since taken control of Achrafieh and Bani Zaid. Five days of fighting killed at least 22 people, including civilians on both sides, according to AP.The United States on Saturday called on the Syrian government and Kurdish authorities to return to negotiations, AFP reported. Conflicting reports emerged from Aleppo, with authorities claiming a halt to fighting and the transfer of Kurdish fighters out of the city, which the Kurdish forces denied.The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces have long been the United States’ main partner against ISIS, but since Assad’s ouster, Washington has increasingly coordinated with Syria’s central government in Damascus. Syria recently joined the global coalition against ISIS.Despite President Donald Trump’s skepticism about US involvement in Syria, hundreds of American troops remain deployed as part of Operation Inherent Resolve. In April, the Pentagon announced plans to cut troop levels in half, and in June US envoy Tom Barrack said the United States would eventually reduce its bases in the country to one.","The United States carried out “large-scale” strikes against Islamic State targets across Syria on Sunday.

A pair of Minneapolis women were seen following and taunting ICE agents just days after the fatal shooting of protester Renee Nicole Good, according to footage shared across social media.The footage showed unidentified women being confronted by masked ICE agents in the streets, as one agent warned them: ""Don't make a bad decision today.""""If I continually see you following us, interfering with us, honking your horn, blocking our cars, you have a very high probability of making a really bad decision and being arrested today, okay?"" the officer warned one woman in her car.The woman grinned and responded: ""I think I'm making exactly the right decision.""A man nearby then yelled from the street: ""Why are you giving her a warning? She's not interfering, she's just following.""As the ICE agent again told the woman in the car to ""not make a bad decision today and ruin your life"", she chuckled and replied: ""Oh, bad decisions, that's funny coming from you.""As the ICE agent told the woman to ""have a nice day"" she responded: ""I hope you have a terrible day.""The footage received millions of hits when it was shared to X by Fox News reporter Matt Finn, as many on social media criticised the women for antagonising ICE agents so soon after the shooting of Good.In footage shared by Finn, an ICE agent was seen confronting another woman for allegedly following and harassing federal agents.

She reversed to head back down the road as an agent tried to open the driver""s side door handle before she drove off. Three shots then rang out.Good lost control of the SUV and slammed it into parked cars and a light pole at high speed, prompting screams from onlookers.

US President Donald Trump has directed senior special forces commanders to begin preparing ""contingency plans for a possible invasion of Greenland"", reported the Daily Mail on Sunday.The move, however, has reportedly run into resistance from top military officials who are questioning both its legality and political feasibility.According to the report, Trump has asked the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) to draft an invasion plan. However, the proposal is said to be facing pushback from the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who argue that any such operation would be unlawful and lack congressional backing.""The generals think Trump's Greenland plan is crazy and illegal. So they are trying to deflect him with other major military operations. They say it's like dealing with a five-year-old,"" a diplomatic told the Mail.“They have tried to distract Trump by talking about less controversial measures, such as intercepting Russian 'ghost' ships - a clandestine network of hundreds of vessels operated by Moscow to evade Western sanctions - or launching a strike on Iran,” a source told the Mail.Sources familiar with the matter told the Mail that hardline figures within Trump’s inner circle, particularly policy “hawks” led by adviser Stephen Miller, have grown increasingly assertive after what they see as the successful operation to capture Venezuela’s leader Nicolas Maduro.Emboldened by that outcome, they are now pushing for swift action to take control of Greenland before Russia or China is able to expand its influence in the Arctic.Trump’s interest in Greenland may also be driven by domestic political considerations. With mid-term elections approaching later this year, there is concern that the president may seek a dramatic foreign policy move to divert attention from the US economy, amid fears Republicans could lose control of Congress to Democrats,"" the Mail reported, citing British diplomatic sources.Such an action would place Trump on a direct collision course with European leaders and could trigger a profound crisis within the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato), potentially bringing the alliance to breaking point.Diplomatic officials have also reportedly conducted internal war-gaming exercises examining what they describe as an “escalatory scenario,” in which Trump could use military force or sustained political pressure to weaken Greenland’s ties with Denmark.A classified diplomatic cable reportedly outlines a “worst-case” outcome that would result in “the destruction of Nato from the inside.”“Some European officials suspect this is the real aim of the hardline MAGA faction around Trump. Since Congress would not allow Trump to exit Nato, occupying Greenland could force the Europeans to abandon Nato. If Trump wants to end Nato, this might be the most convenient way to do it,” it added.Meanwhile, political parties in Greenland on Saturday issued a joint statement denouncing US President Donald Trump's pressure to seize the Danish autonomous territory.""We don't want to be Americans, we don't want to be Danish, we want to be Greenlanders,"" the leaders of five parties in parliament said.""The future of Greenland must be decided by Greenlanders,"" they added.This came hours after Trump once again spoke about taking action on Greenland, saying the US would have to do “something” or risk Russia and China stepping in. He said Washington does not want Moscow or Beijing as its “neighbours”.""We are going to do something on Greenland, whether they like it or not, because if we don't do it, Russia or China will take over Greenland -- and we're not going to have Russia or China as a neighbour. I would like to make a deal the easy way but if we don't do it the easy way, we're going to do it the hard way,"" Trump said.""And by the way, I'm a fan of Denmark as well. They've been very nice to me. I'm a big fan but the fact that they had a boat land there 500 years ago doesn't mean that they own the land. We had lots of boats go there also. But we need that because if you take a look at outside of Greenland right now, they are Russian destroyers, Chinese destroyers and bigger there are Russian submarines all over the place. We're not going to have Russia or China occupy Greenland and that's what they're going to do if we don't. We will do something with Greenland either the nice way or the difficult way,"" he added.Denmark has also warned that its troops are under orders to “shoot first and ask question later” if Greenland comes under attack, as concerns grow in Europe over the US openly discussing possible military action against the Arctic territory.Earlier, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen rejected Trump’s claims that the US “needs” Greenland for security reasons, calling them an “unacceptable pleasure”.","US President Donald Trump has directed senior special forces commanders to begin preparing ""contingency plans for a possible invasion of Greenland"" However, the proposal is said to be facing pushback from the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who argue that any such operation would be unlawful and lack congressional backing.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126461661,imgsize-35532,width-400,resizemode-4/us-president-trump.jpg"

Canada Rejects 74% Indian Student Visas In August, Citing Fraud, As Ties With India Hit New Low





The Canada administration is not opening its Parents and Grandparents Program (PGP) in 2026 either and continuing with the halt that it announced in 2025. The agency will process the applications received before 2025 and a maximum of 10,000 applications will be processed. As of now, the program is not open to accepting any new applications. Those who are looking to bring their parents and grandparents to Canada are being advised by immigration experts to opt for a super visa, which will not give parents or grandparents permanent residency in Canada but they can stay for upto five years in Canada, and the visa can be renewed.A few years ago, the administration found that over 40,000 parent and grandparent sponsorship applications were still pending at the end of 2023. The huge backlog has to be cleared first to allow new sponsorships and so the halt was put in place in 2025 and will be continued in 2026 as well.After announcing a halt on new applications on January 1, 2025, the IRCC invited potential sponsors who submitted an interest to sponsor for, in 2020 to apply for the 2025 intake. That process started from July 28, 2025 and ended on October 9, 2025. The IRCC said they sent 17,860 invitations over approximately 2 weeks but they will accept 10,000 complete applications.The program was designed to reunite immigrants in Canada who have become permanent residents, which means only permanent residents in Canada could sponsor their parents and grandparents to enter Canada. This program also allows parents and grandparents to work in Canada and to get provincial healthcare, which the super visa does not.The sponsors of this immigration program are canadian citizens who agree to financially support the sponsored individuals for 20 years, starting from the day the parents or the grandparents become permanent residents.Canada plans to reduce the total number of new permanent residents in Canada by four per cent from last year, stating it will only grant permanent resident status to a total of 380,000 in 2026.","The Canada administration is not opening its Parents and Grandparents Program (PGP) in 2026 either.

Oil Tankers Flip Trump’s Game? Venezuela’s ‘Dark Mode’ Fleet TRICKS US, Then Comes Back. Here’s Why





US President Donald Trump on Sunday shared an image of his Wikipedia page that described him as the “Acting President of Venezuela”.Shared on Truth Social , the image listed Trump as assuming office on January 20, 2025, and remaining incumbent as of January 2026. It also identified US Vice President JD Vance as his deputy.However, the image appeared doctored, as no official documentation or legal framework exists indicating that the US president holds any governing role in Venezuela as of now.The controversial post comes amid major political and military developments in Venezuela following a US-led operation that resulted in the capture of former Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro. Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were detained during a US military operation in Caracas and flown to New York.The pair are being held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn and face federal charges related to drug trafficking and alleged cooperation with gangs designated by the US as terrorist organisations. Maduro, however, has denied the allegations.US officials told CBS News that the operation was carried out by the US Army’s Delta Force following months of military build-up in the region, including the deployment of the aircraft carrier USS Gerald R.Ford and other naval assets in the Caribbean.Following Maduro’s removal, Venezuela’s vice president and oil minister, Delcy Rodríguez, was formally sworn in last week as the country’s interim president. Rodríguez, a 56-year-old lawyer and senior figure within the ruling political movement, took the oath before the National Assembly, which is headed by her brother, Jorge Rodríguez.A total of 283 lawmakers elected in parliamentary elections held in May were also sworn in. Most opposition parties boycotted the vote, leaving the legislature dominated by pro-government figures. The only lawmaker absent from the ceremony was Cilia Flores, who remains in US custody, Reuters reported.Earlier, in a statement made in Washington, US President Trump said that the United States would “run” Venezuela temporarily during a transition period and would “get the oil flowing”. He later said the US was “in charge” of Venezuela. However, Secretary of State Marco Rubio sought to clarify the administration’s position, saying the US does not intend to directly govern the country but will enforce an “oil quarantine” as part of efforts to influence policy outcomes.","US President Donald Trump on Sunday shared an image of his Wikipedia page that described him as the “Acting President of Venezuela” The image listed Trump as assuming office on January 20, 2025, and remaining incumbent as of January 2026.

US President Donald Trump said on Sunday that the US military was studying “very strong options” for a potential military action against Iran, amid reports of deadly crackdowns against the country's mounting anti-government protests.Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump suggested Iran may have crossed a red line he had previously set regarding the killing of protesters.“They're starting to, it looks like,” he said when asked if that line had been crossed.“Some people, who were not supposed to be killed, have been killed...

Around 192 people were reported killed by Sunday morning, though the true toll remains unclear due to an ongoing internet blackout.Senior regime officials signaled a hardening stance, with some suggesting protesters should face the death penalty, while another likened them to terrorists.","US President Donald Trump said on Sunday that the US military was studying ""very strong options"" for a potential military action against Iran.

On January 7, 2026, Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old poet and mother was fatally shot and killed by an ICE agent in Minneapolis. The shooting took place at East 34th Street and Portland Avenue just blocks away from where a Minneapolis officer murdered George Floyd in 2020.The incident not only revived the city's history of killings by federal agents but also sparked off weeks of protests against the agency and the Trump administration. The video of the entire incident has been shared far and wide online, buzzing social media condemning the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency and calls for its closure.While the world has been reeling with the brutal incident, U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem characterised Good's actions as an ""act of domestic terrorism"". This is one of the many comments from the Trump administration whose officials including Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, have all sided with the agency in the act.Recently, in an interview with CNN Noem appeared to smirk as she admitted that the ICE agent who killed Renee Good may have called her a ""f****** b****"" moments after fatally shooting her.When asked if it was agent Jonathan Ross' voice calling Renee Good the vile words, Noem replied: “I can‘t determine which one it is, but it could be, sir,” before giving a brief smile.Her blatant and off-putting reaction disappointed the viewers who have not been happy with the DHS Secretary for a while now. “That smirk at the end is the smile of a satisfied puppy killer,” wrote one user on X. “Note Noem’s smile at the end,"" added another.""Satisfied puppy killer"" isn't just a random comment, it refers to an anecdote from Noem's memoir in which she described killing her 14-month-old dog, Cricket, because the puppy was difficult to train. Yes, being blasé about killing and death isn't new to Noem.“Cricket was a wirehair pointer, about 14 months old,” wrote the former South Dakota governor in her book 'No Going Back: The Truth on What’s Wrong with Politics and How We Move America Forward' published in May 2024. She added that the female dog had an ""aggressive personality"" and needed to be trained to be used for hunting pheasant.While she hoped to calm the young pooch down and teach her how to behave, she was unfortunately going, “out of her mind with excitement, chasing all those birds and having the time of her life”.She wrote that she ""hated the dog"" whom she described as ""a picture of joy."" It had proved itself “untrainable”, “dangerous to anyone she came in contact with” and “less than worthless … as a hunting dog”.“At that moment,” Noem said, “I realised I had to put her down.” “It was not a pleasant job,” she wrote, “but it had to be done. And after it was over, I realised another unpleasant job needed to be done.”Incredibly, Noem's tale of slaughter did not end there. She also wrote about her family's male goat that was nasty and mean”, because it had not been castrated. It smelled “disgusting, musky, rancid” and “loved to chase” Noem’s children, knocking them down and ruining their clothes.She decided to kill the untamed goat the same way she had just killed Cricket, the dog.In the book, she added that she includes the story of killing her dog to illustrate her willingness, in politics as well as in South Dakota life. She also reflected on her sharing of peculiar information, adding: “I guess if I were a better politician I wouldn’t tell the story here.”","U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem characterised Renee Nicole Good's actions as an ""act of domestic terrorism"" In an interview with CNN Noem appeared to smirk as she admitted that the ICE agent who killed Renee Good may have called her a ""f****** b****"" In her memoir Noem described killing her 14-month-old dog because the puppy was difficult to train.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126473226,imgsize-33316,width-400,resizemode-4/39satisfied-puppy-killer39-kristi-noem39s-39dog-killing39-story-resurfaces-amid-ice-murder-row.jpg"

She added that enforcement unfairly targets minorities.“It ends up being black and brown people” who are arrested most often, she claimed.Larsson’s posts became more confrontational as she compared ICE agents to criminals. “Idk about yall but I’d rather have someone smoking crack on my couch than a f**king ICE agent ewwwwwwwww,” she wrote. “They’re criminals too.

Donald Trump’s renewed noise about taking control of Greenland has pushed the Arctic island back into global focus. Framing the idea as a matter of “national security,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, “We need Greenland,” just days after what he described as a successful military intervention in Venezuela. The remarks may sound extreme, but behind the political bluster, some of the world’s richest men have already been quietly investing in Greenland for years.Trump’s interest in Greenland did not begin recently. According to Forbes, his former national security adviser John Bolton said Trump first floated the idea of buying Greenland in late 2018. Bolton said Trump told him that “a prominent businessman he knew had suggested that the U.S. buy Greenland,” later identifying that businessman as Ronald Lauder.Trump and Lauder share a long personal history, having attended the Wharton School of Business at the same time. Lauder has also been a major funder of conservative political candidates and causes. His business interests have extended to Greenland as well. The Danish newspaper Politiken reported that Lauder invested in an unprofitable Greenlandic freshwater bottling company co-owned by Jørgen Wæver Johansen, the local chair of the governing Siumut party in Nuuk and the husband of Greenland’s foreign minister, Vivian Motzfeldt.The investment raised concerns about potential political interference.Some of the biggest names in tech have also placed bets on Greenland, though through mineral exploration rather than politics. Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates and Michael Bloomberg have invested in KoBold Metals, a company using AI-powered technology to search for rare earth minerals used in electronic devices. These investments began in 2019.The backing came through Breakthrough Energy, a fund led by Gates that aims “to accelerate green energy innovation and build the industries of the future.” Forbes reported that Breakthrough Energy participated in KoBold’s Series C funding round in December 2024, which valued the company at just under $3 billion following a $537 million capital raise. Earlier, in 2022, Sam Altman invested through his venture fund Apollo Projects during KoBold’s Series B round, which totaled $192.5 million. An SEC filing cited by Forbes shows the company is now in the process of raising more funds, potentially returning to its billionaire backers as Greenland draws fresh attention.Not all of these investments are viewed as purely commercial. Speaking to Forbes, Arctic security expert Marc Jacobsen, an associate professor at the Royal Danish Defence College, said Lauder’s Greenland investments were unlikely to have “any economic substance.” He added, “What is important here is the close link to Greenlandic decision makers. This is about strategy and gaining control.”Jacobsen also told Forbes that American presence in Greenland has increased in recent years, partly due to new direct flights between New York and Nuuk. “There are more Americans in Greenland than ever before,” he said, adding that “it can be difficult to know if they're only tourists or if they also have an interest in ‘strategic investments’.”Elon Musk has taken a more public stance. Writing on X last January, Musk voiced support for U.S. annexation, saying, “If the people of Greenland want to be part of America, which I hope they do, they would be most welcome.”Meanwhile, Greenland’s own leaders have been firm in rejecting the notion that the island should be up for grabs. In a joint statement, Greenland’s political parties declared, “We do not want to be Americans… we want to be Greenlanders,” emphasizing self-determination and criticizing external pressure.","Donald Trump's renewed noise about taking control of Greenland has pushed the Arctic island back into global focus. Some of the world’s richest men have already been quietly investing in Greenland for years.

Christian Nationalist Dale Partridge says his marriage is not ""ideal"" because his wife isn't white.

Dale Partridge telling the world that none of his daughters will make an ""ideal"" wife.

So Dale Partridge offers up his own marriage to the defense of a false pastor, arguing for the “not ideal/not a sin” view of “interracial” marriage.

At some point you gotta blame women for letting losers like this procreate.





Christian nationalist commentator and pastor Dale Partridge faced backlash after saying interracial marriage is not “ideal.""However, he praised his own marriage to a Mexican American woman as loving and successful, which the internet called hypocritical.Partridge shared his views in a lengthy post on X, where he said he agreed with fellow Christian nationalist Joel Webbon, who has argued that interracial marriage falls outside God’s “normative design.""Partridge said he had been married for 16 years and that he does not believe interracial marriage is a sin.“Interracial marriage is not the ‘ideal,’” Partridge wrote.The Christian added that interracial marriage can be 'glorious'. “Now, like Joel, I do not believe it is sinful, and if providence positions two Christians from different ethnic backgrounds to unite in marriage, it can be a glorious thing (which it has been for us).”He argued that marriages between people of different ethnic backgrounds face added challenges that couples of the same ethnicity do not. These include “overcoming different family expectations and cultural traditions”, as well as a wife’s assimilation into her husband’s culture.Partridge added that a husband must learn how his wife’s “ethnos has shaped her instincts, sensitivities, and assumptions”.However, Partridge believed it is more difficult for people to bond if they belong to different cultures. “But unity has undoubtedly been more difficult for us than for couples who share the same ethnic background.”In a follow-up post, Partridge defended his position by arguing that race and culture were historically inseparable. He rejected the notion that modern-day multiculturalism is just a social construct. “For most of human history, a people shared blood, land, language, customs, religion, and social expectations,” he wrote. “Race was not an abstract concept; it was embodied in culture.”He said recognising that interracial marriages carry additional hurdles was not a moral judgement.The comments stirred a row on the internet, including among Christians married to interracial partners.","Dale Partridge says interracial marriage is not 'ideal' because his wife isn't white.

US Congressman Ro Khanna has said he was “horrified” by conditions at a California immigration detention centre after speaking directly with dozens of detainees who described a lack of medical care, poor food and degrading living conditions, even worse than what animals live in.In a post on X and in interviews following his visit, the Indian-origin Congressman said the California City ICE Detention Facility was marked by “a violation of human rights”. The privately run centre is located in the Mojave Desert and opened in late August last year under a contract with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).Khanna said he spoke with 47 detainees during his visit on January 5. “One man with blood in his urine had not been able to see a doctor, another complained of rocks in the food, another of not having a long sleeve shirt, shivering at night,” he said.He later told KQED the conditions amounted to “systemic neglect”.“We’re treating these people like animals, not like human beings … It’s an embarrassment for the country,” Khanna said.Khanna only asked for people to be treated with dignity. “Whatever you think about the consequences for people who are undocumented, we should all agree that you treat people with dignity.”The visit comes as ICE detains more people than at any point in its history, with roughly 69,000 people in custody as of late December, under President Donald Trump’s MAGA-aligned immigration crackdown.Detention-related deaths have also surged, with 32 reported in 2025, the highest number in more than two decades.Khanna said he spent about three hours at the facility with an aide. He was told there were more than 1,400 detainees, including 215 women, though ICE data from December listed 922 people in custody. The facility is set to become the largest ICE detention centre in California, with capacity for nearly 26,000 detainees.Officials gave him a tour of the centre and Khanna said his conversations with detainees revealed disturbing things.“During the tour, [the warden and other prison officials] were showing us they were going by the book,” he said. “Then when we met the detainees, I was just floored.”Detainees described undrinkable water, repeated lockdowns, no-contact family visits and severe delays in medical care. Khanna said he saw only one doctor attending to around 40 patients during his visit. “It was really dehumanizing, and many of them were in tears,” he said.CoreCivic, which operates the facility, rejected claims of neglect. A company spokesperson said health and safety were a top priority and that detainees have daily access to medical and mental health services.","Congressman Ro Khanna says he was 'horrified' by conditions at a California immigration detention centre.

What Pivotal Philanthropies Foundation does

Mental health resources for young people

Efforts aimed at reducing political violence

Programmes supporting women’s participation and leadership in the workplace

A major shift in philanthropic power





Bill Gates has transferred $7.9 billion to a nonprofit controlled by Melinda Gates, according to recent tax filings, marking one of the largest single charitable transfers ever reported. The move dramatically expands the scale of Melinda Gates’ independent philanthropic work and immediately places her foundation among the world’s most highly capitalised private charities.The funds were transferred in late 2024 to the Pivotal Philanthropies Foundation, the tax-exempt foundation arm of Melinda Gates’ broader organisation, Pivotal Ventures. Public filings show that once the transfer was completed, the foundation ranked among the largest private philanthropic entities globally by assets.The donation was made under a $12.5 billion agreement reached in 2024, after Bill and Melinda Gates decided to end their joint philanthropic work at the Gates Foundation, which they built together over several decades. The couple divorced in 2021 but initially continued collaborating through the foundation.A spokesperson for Pivotal confirmed that the $7.9 billion transfer was part of that agreement and that the commitment has now been fulfilled in full.The Gates Foundation did not respond to requests for comment regarding the filing.Pivotal Philanthropies Foundation was established in 2022 and operates alongside Pivotal Ventures, which Melinda Gates has led for more than a decade. While Pivotal Ventures blends grant-making with venture-style investments, the foundation structure allows for large-scale, long-term charitable funding.According to its most recent tax filing, the foundation distributed $875 million in 2024 alone. Its funding supports initiatives primarily focused in the United States, while also engaging with partners and organisations that operate internationally. Key areas of work include:The filing shows the foundation operates with a relatively small leadership structure. Melinda Gates is listed as a director, alongside senior advisers responsible for governance, finance and oversight.Beyond the headline figure, the transfer represents a significant rebalancing of philanthropic influence. For years, Bill and Melinda Gates jointly shaped global giving through the Gates Foundation. This move places nearly $8 billion under Melinda Gates’ sole philanthropic direction, giving her independent authority to define priorities and deploy capital at scale.Before the transfer became public, Bill Gates’ net worth stood at about $118 billion, while Melinda Gates was valued at $17.7 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.Single donations of this magnitude are exceptionally rare, even among the world’s wealthiest individuals. Unlike pledges spread across decades, the Gates transfer involved nearly $8 billion moved at once, immediately reshaping the balance of assets in global philanthropy.In scale, structure and timing, Bill Gates’ $7.9 billion transfer to Melinda Gates’ nonprofit stands as one of the most consequential charity movements of the modern era.",Bill Gates has transferred $7.9 billion to a nonprofit controlled by Melinda Gates.

CDS Anil Chauhan Reveals Why Pakistan Rushed To Promote Asim Munir After Op Sindoor Setback

Def experts: Azhar’s statement sign of post-Sindoor frustration





A new audio recording purportedly featuring Maulana Masood Azhar , the elusive chief of terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), has surfaced on social media, boasting that his organisation now commands ""thousands"" of suicide bombers who are prepared for immediate deployment.The clip has surfaced at a time when Pahalgam attack mastermind and Lashkar-e-Taiba deputy chief Saifullah Kasuri was captured on video claiming that the Pakistani army had invited him to lead the funeral prayers of its soldiers after Operation Sindoor - conducted by India in May last year following the terror attack in J&K. Both clips were posted on Telegram and X by pro-ISI accounts.The messages are being viewed as a desperate propaganda attempt to revitalize a group reeling from devastating losses inflicted by the Indian armed forces during the operation. Kasoori's speech was made from a school with hundreds of children visible in the audience while Azhar too is seemingly addressing a public gathering, sources said.In another video, Kasuri has also welcomed the growing diplomatic and military ties between Pakistan and Bangladesh. The latest recording features a defiant Azhar claiming that the sheer number of his followers would ""cause an uproar in the global media"" if fully revealed.Azhar said new recruits are driven by the obsession of attaining ""martyrdom"".Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) Masood Azhar asserts that these recruits are driven by a fanatical obsession with “martyrdom”, explicitly stating that they do not seek material comforts like cars, motorcycles or foreign visas. “They only ask Allah for one thing: martyrdom,” the UN-designated terrorist claimed, attempting to project a picture of high morale and spiritual conviction among his cadre.However, defence experts suggested this was little more than a “hollow threat” and a sign of severe frustration arising out of Operation Sindoor, a series of precision strikes by India in May 2025 that decimated JeM’s infrastructure and eliminated at least 10 of Azhar’s close relatives and top aides in Bahawalpur.“This audio appears to be a calculated effort to save face after the group’s leadership was ‘torn to pieces’, as recently admitted by other JeM commanders,” said a source. Interestingly, Azhar has not been seen in public since a 2019 blast at his Bahawalpur hideout, leading to persistent rumours about his health and location.This latest audio, while lacking visual proof of his life, indicates that the terror mastermind is still attempting to operate from the shadows, deep within a safe haven in Pakistan. Security agencies are now closely analysing voice samples and metadata of the clip to track its origin and assess the current threat level posed by the group’s surviving sleeper cells, sources said.","A new audio recording purportedly featuring Maulana Masood Azhar has surfaced on social media, boasting that his organisation now commands ""thousands"" of suicide bombers.

Open Letter From Pakistan Backs India As Baloch Leader Signals Diplomatic Break With Islamabad





A fresh surge of enforced disappearances has been reported across Balochistan, Karachi, and adjoining regions, with nine more Baloch citizens allegedly taken away by Pakistsecurity agencies in recent weeks.Human rights defenders stated that these incidents follow a familiar pattern: individuals are arrested without warrants, held in secret locations, and never brought before a court, as reported by The Balochistan Post.According to The Balochistan Post, sources in Mand, Kech district, stated that Abdullah, son of Iqbal, was whisked away and shifted to an unknown facility. In Karachi, 24-year-old student Hamdan, son of Muhammad Ali, was detained by CTD officials in the Golimar area, with no subsequent legal proceedings or public acknowledgement of his custody.On November 2, 2025, three youths, Dawood Baloch, Usman Baloch, and Hakeem Majeed Baloch, were picked up during early-morning raids in Bhatta Colony by teams from Military Intelligence and the CTD. Their whereabouts remain undisclosed.Additional cases include the late-night detention of religious instructor Zubair from Quetta's Lak Pass area on November 20; the abduction of labourer Muhammad Iqbal Marri from outside the Rakhni Sessions Court in Barkhan on December 26; and the raid in Mastung on 11 December in which Frontier Corps and CTD personnel allegedly took 21-year-old herder Saeed Ahmed.Families say none of these detainees have resurfaced. According to another report, 17-year-old student Jamal Murad was apprehended in Gwadar on 2 January by CTD and Military Intelligence operatives, after which he disappeared.The Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP) continued its protest camp outside the Quetta Press Club, marking its 6,052nd day. Families, including the relatives of Nasreena Baloch, reportedly detained during a raid in Hub Chowki, joined the demonstration.Her family stated that local police refused to register an FIR, while the Hub Press Club was locked to stop their press briefing, as highlighted by The Balochistan Post.VBMP Chairman Nasrullah Baloch accused state institutions of weaponising national security to intensify enforced disappearances, even targeting Baloch women. He said detainees are denied legal rights, courts are bypassed, and new laws merely protect extrajudicial actions.He called on national and international bodies to take meaningful steps to end the crisis and secure the release of all missing persons, as reported by The Balochistan Post.","A fresh surge of enforced disappearances has been reported across Balochistan, Karachi, and adjoining regions.

Pakistan on Saturday claimed that Iraq has expressed “keen interest” in acquiring JF-17 Thunder fighter jets and Super Mushshak training aircraft, following talks between the air chiefs of the two countries.According to a statement issued by the Pakistan Army, air chief marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu, chief of air staff of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF), met lieutenant general staff pilot Mohanad Ghalib Mohammed Radi Al-Asadi, commander of the Iraqi Air Force, during an official visit to Iraq.The discussions focused on enhancing bilateral military cooperation, including joint training, capacity building and operational coordination.“The Iraqi air chief praised PAF’s professionalism and technological advancement, expressed interest in benefiting from PAF’s world-class training and expressed keen interest in JF-17 Thunder fighter jets and Super Mushshak trainer aircraft,” the statement said, as quoted by news agency PTI.Both sides also agreed to pursue joint exercises and training initiatives to strengthen interoperability between the two air forces.The JF-17 Thunder is a single-engine, lightweight combat aircraft jointly developed by China’s Chengdu Aircraft Corporation and the Pakistan Aeronautical Complex.Pakistan has claimed that the aircraft proved its capabilities during last year’s conflict with India, although its effectiveness remains disputed.Pakistan had also deployed Chinese-origin J-10 fighter jets during the May 7–10 hostilities with India.The development comes days after Pakistan and Bangladesh air chiefs held talks on the “potential procurement” of JF-17 jets by Dhaka. However, Bangladesh has not officially confirmed any such plan.Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif recently claimed that the country has seen increased interest in its fighter aircraft following the May 2025 standoff with India. Reports have also suggested that Pakistan is exploring similar defence deals with other countries, including Saudi Arabia, amid ongoing financial pressures.Notably, Pakistan has repeatedly relied on International Monetary Fund support in recent years, with the IMF approving a $7 billion bailout in September 2024 and an additional $1.4 billion loan in May 2025.",Iraq has expressed “keen interest’ in acquiring JF-17 Thunder fighter jets and Super Mushshak training aircraft.

Widespread protests erupted in Pakistan’s Sindh province after a young Hindu farmer was killed by a landlord in Badin.According to a report by Pakistan's news outlet the Nation, Kailash Kolhi was shot dead by an influential landlord, Sarfaraz Nizamani, over the construction of a hut on his land.Following Kolhi’s death, demonstrators staged sit-ins on the Badin–Hyderabad National Highway and the Badin–Thar Coal Road. Hundreds of vehicles remained stranded for hours as protesters demanded justice for the killing of Kolhi and vowed not to disperse until those responsible are arrested.According to a statement shared by activist Shiva Kachhi, the protest has been ongoing without pause.“The protest for the arrest of the killers of the martyred Kailash Kolhi is making history. Shiva Kachhi, Chairman of Pakistan Darawar Ittehad, is leading the historic protest sit-in. This was not just a protest—it was the cry of a wounded conscience. From 10:00 am yesterday until late into the night, the sit-in continued without pause, proving that the demand for justice cannot be silenced,” Kachhi said in a social media post on X.“Men, women, elderly people, and innocent children stayed on the streets with one voice and one demand: justice for Kailash Kolhi.Arrest the killers. Despite exhaustion, hunger, and the cold of the night, the determination of the protesters remained unshaken. Kailash Kolhi’s only ‘crime’ was that he was poor, marginalised, and courageous enough to exist in a system that protects the powerful and crushes the weak. The tears of his children, the grief of his mother, and the silent agony of his widow are today questioning the entire system: Is the blood of the poor so cheap?” he added.Earlier, the victim’s family and community members staged a protest by placing the body at Piru Lashari Stop, where the SSP Badin assured them that the accused would be arrested within 24 hours.The incident occurred four days ago in Raho Kolhi village in the Piru Lashari city area. Despite assurances from district police officials, the main accused has yet to be arrested.The ongoing protest has drawn participation from leaders and workers of several political, nationalist, religious, and social organisations, including Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI), Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), Jiye Sindh Mahaz, Qaumi Awami Tehreek, Jeay Sindh Qaumi Mahaz (Bashir Qureshi group), and Awami Tehreek, The Nation reported.","Kailash Kolhi was shot dead by an influential landlord, Sarfaraz Nizamani, over the construction of a hut on his land.

The world has not seen a bigger criminal.”Asif also appeared to raise the issue of penalising those he termed as enablers of such crimes, beginning a sentence with, “And what does the law say about those who support such criminals…” before the show’s anchor, Hamid Mir, interjected and called for a break.Mir warned that Asif’s remarks risked being interpreted as a veiled reference to US President Donald Trump, and indicated that Asif would not remain on air after the break.Pakistan does not have formal diplomatic relations with Israel and has historically expressed strong support for the Palestinian cause. Islamabad also maintains close ties with Iran, another regional critic of Israeli policies.The international criminal court (ICC) has previously issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu in connection with alleged war crimes in Gaza, a legal development referenced during the interview.","Khawaja Asif said the US should apprehend Netanyahu “just as Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro was taken away” He added that Turkey could also seize the Israeli leader, and “Pakistanis are praying for it” Asif also appeared to raise the issue of penalising those he termed as enablers of such crimes.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126438854,imgsize-837064,width-400,resizemode-4/khawaja-asif-file.jpg"
Gen Z uprising in Pakistan? PhD student's article challenges those in power — why it was taken down,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/gen-z-uprising-in-pakistan-phd-students-article-challenges-those-in-power-why-it-was-taken-down/articleshow/126409692.cms,"Badshahi Mosque, Lahore (AP photo)





Is Pakistan heading towards a Gen Z uprising? A PhD student from the country has sparked a debate after critically examining present-day Pakistan, under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and army chief and de facto power centre Asim Munir , without naming either directly.The piece, written through a lens that shows contrast in powerful boomer generation and youth of Gen Z-Alpha, quickly struck a chord online and became a flashpoint for what many described as a quiet rebellion. It highlighted the widening divide between Pakistan’s ruling establishment, often referred to as “Boomers,” and its increasingly restless Gen Z population.The article, titled “It is over,” was written by US-based PhD student Zorain Nizamani and published in Pakistan’s daily The Express Tribune on January 1. It was later taken down, reportedly following pressure from the Pakistani military.“For the older men and women in power, it's over. The young generation isn't buying any of what you're trying to sell to them. No matter how many talks and seminars you arrange in schools and colleges, trying to promote patriotism, it isn't working,” Nizamani wrote.Writing from the perspective of Gen Z and Generation Alpha, Nizamani rejected what he described as an imposed narrative of patriotism pushed by those in power, arguing that such efforts no longer resonate with young Pakistanis.“Young minds, the Gen Z, the alphas, they know exactly what is happening, and despite your consistent efforts of trying to 'sell' your views of patriotism to them, they are seeing right through it. Thanks to the internet, thanks to whatever little education we have left, despite your best efforts of keeping the masses as illiterate as possible, you have failed. You have failed to tell people what to think, they are thinking for themselves. They might be a little too scared to speak their minds because they prefer breathing,” Nizamani wrote.He argued that forced patriotism, speeches and seminars cannot replace justice, opportunity and basic rights, and said young people clearly see corruption, inequality and hypocrisy despite censorship and propaganda.Nizamani also highlighted generational differences over economic freedom, writing, “The Gen Z wants erased restrictions on freelancing, the boomers want to increase regulations on freelancing.”Concluding his article, he wrote: “Boomers, we have had enough. We aren't buying your narrative anymore. It's worn out.”The article drew support from followers of former prime minister Imran Khan, who is currently incarcerated. The Canada wing of Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaaf (PTI) shared the article on X, highlighting its key points.“Zorain Nizamani's article ‘It is Over’ was removed from eTribune most likely for exposing the reality: DG ISPR's university visits are futile. The youth see through propaganda and are no longer easy to mislead or control,” the PTI Canada wing said.Pakistani activist Mehlaqa Samdani also linked the article’s removal to censorship. “Not surprisingly, this article is no longer accessible through the Express Tribune's digital edition, exactly the kind of censorship Zorain talks about,” she wrote.The episode has intensified online debate over whether Pakistan’s younger generation is moving from quiet disillusionment toward open resistance against an entrenched establishment widely seen as out of touch.","US-based PhD student Zorain Nizamani wrote an article on Pakistan's ruling establishment.

No IMF Loan In 6 Months? Pakistan Defence Minister’s Jet Export Claim Collapses Under Debt Reality

Pakistan's repeated reliance on IMF

Bangladesh shows interest in Pak's JF-17

Pak seeks JF-17 deal with Saudi Arabia





Pakistan on Tuesday expressed confidence that it may no longer need financial assistance from the International Monetary Fund within six months, with Pakistan defence minister Khawaja Asif claiming the country had seen a surge in aircraft orders following a four-day military standoff with India in May, Geo TV reported.Speaking on a Geo News programme, Asif made a fanciful claim while arguing that the May 2025 India-Pakistan conflict showcased Pakistan's ""resolve and military effectiveness"" to the world.Military tensions escalated in May 2025 after Pakistan-sponsored terrorists carried out a terror attack in Pahalgam, killing 26 civilians in April. India responded with a strong military operation, launching Operation Sindoor, under which it targeted and destroyed multiple terror camps and Pakistani military facilities.However, Khawaja Asif, appearing disconnected from the ground reality, made such statements after a Bangladeshi defence delegation met Pakistan's air chief to discuss a potential sale of the JF-17 Thunder, the multi-role fighter aircraft jointly developed by China and Pakistan.There are also reports of talks between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia to convert about $2 billion in Saudi loans into a JF-17 fighter jet deal, according to two Pakistani sources cited by Reuters.According to Arab News, several countries have since stepped up defence engagement with Pakistan.“Right now, the number of orders we are receiving after reaching this point is significant because our aircraft have been tested,” defence minister Asif told Pakistan’s Geo News channel.“We are receiving these orders, and it is possible that after six months we may not even need the IMF,” he said.Pakistan markets the Chinese co-developed JF-17 as a lower-cost multi-role fighter and has positioned itself as a supplier offering aircraft, training and maintenance outside Western supply chains.“I am saying this with full confidence,” Asif said. “If all these orders materialise over the next six months, we will not need the IMF.”Pakistan has repeatedly turned to the International Monetary Fund over the years, for financial support to stabilise its fragile economy, with such assistance tied to strict conditions including fiscal reforms, subsidy cuts and revenue-enhancing measures.In September 2024, the IMF approved a $7 billion bailout for Pakistan under its Extended Fund Facility (EFF), followed by a separate $1.4 billion loan under its climate resilience fund in May 2025, aimed at bolstering the country’s economic stability and climate resilience.Demonstrating Dhaka’s efforts to move closer to Islamabad, Bangladesh has expressed “potential interest” in acquiring the JF-17 Thunder fighter aircraft from Pakistan, along with plans to resume direct flights between the two countries from January 29 after a gap of more than a decade.The JF-17, jointly developed by China and Pakistan, was deployed by Pakistan against India during the May 7–10 hostilities. In November last year, Indian Air Force chief Air chief Marshal A P Singh said the aircraft was among at least five high-tech Pakistani fighters shot down during Operation Sindoor.This latest development and closeness between Pakistan and Bangladesh comes under the pretext of Dhaka's straining relations with India.Pakistan and Saudi Arabia are also in talks to convert around $2 billion in Saudi loans into a JF-17 fighter jet deal, as two Pakistani sources told Reuters, in a move that would deepen military cooperation between two Islamic nations. Pakistan and Saudi signed a mutual defence pact last year.The discussions highlight efforts by the long-time allies to operationalise defence cooperation at a time when Pakistan is under acute financial strain and Saudi Arabia is recalibrating its security partnerships amid uncertainty over US commitments in the Middle East.","Pakistani defence minister Khawaja Asif says country may not need IMF help in six months.

Own goal? Pakistan admits political-criminal-terror nexus on its soil; report flags rising violence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/own-goal-pakistan-admits-political-criminal-terror-nexus-on-its-soil-report-flags-rising-violence/articleshow/126374963.cms,"Explained: The Sindhudesh Push In Karachi And The Historical Fractures Driving Pakistan’s Turmoil





Pakistan’s Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry on Tuesday said that nearly 71% of terrorist incidents reported in 2025 originated from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP). He attributed this concentration to a “politically conducive environment and the flourishing political-criminal-terror-nexus which is flourishing there”.Data released by the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) reinforces the scale of the surge. KP recorded the sharpest rise in violence, with “fatalities rose from 1,620 in 2024 to 2,331 in 2025” — a year-on-year increase of more than 40%.The broader national picture is even starker. According to the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS), 2025 was the “deadliest” year in a decade, with 3,387 combat-related deaths. These included 2,115 terrorists, 664 security personnel, 580 civilians and 28 members of pro-government peace committees. PICSS said violence intensified in both “tempo and lethality”, pushing multiple security indicators to their highest levels in years.“Militant attacks climbed to their highest annual total since 2014, and the use of suicide bombings and small drones showed a clear upward trend,” the report said.Suicide attacks rose by 53%, while terrorist incidents overall increased to 1,063 — the highest since 2014.Security forces and civilians also bore rising costs. Security personnel fatalities rose 26% to their highest level since 2011, while civilian deaths increased by 24%, marking the worst toll in a decade. Injuries surged by 53% to 2,263, with sharp rises across all categories.The violence has been most acute in KP and Balochistan. In Bannu alone, Deputy Inspector General Sajjad Khan said 27 police personnel were killed in 134 attacks during 2025. Police carried out 168 intelligence-based operations, arresting 105 militants and killing 65, he said.Pakistan frequently accuses Afghanistan’s Taliban authorities of sheltering the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a militant group blamed for a sharp increase in attacks inside Pakistan since 2021. Afghan officials reject the allegations, insisting they do not permit their territory to be used for attacks against other countries.While the TTP operates independently from Afghanistan’s Taliban, the two groups maintain close ties.Relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan have deteriorated since October, when border clashes followed explosions in Kabul on Oct. 9 that Afghan officials attributed to Pakistan. Although Qatar later helped mediate a ceasefire, talks hosted by Turkey in November failed to produce a lasting agreement.","KP recorded the sharpest rise in violence, with “fatalities rose from 1,620 in 2024 to 2,331 in 2025’ The broader national picture is even starker. 2025 was the “deadliest” year in a decade, with 3,387 combat-related deaths.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126375028,imgsize-1338682,width-400,resizemode-4/photo-credit-ap.jpg"

ISLAMABAD: The polio vaccination campaign in Pakistan's merged districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa fell short of its target, leaving over 935,000 children under five unvaccinated, officials said, citing security challenges and population displacement as key hurdles, The Express Tribune reported.According to The Express Tribune, citing authorities, thousands of families from North and South Waziristan, Bajaur, and other merged districts have migrated to different parts of the country, complicating monitoring and vaccination efforts.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Khyber Pakhtunkhwa reported 19 polio cases in 2025, including four each in North Waziristan, Lakki Marwat, and Tank; three in Bannu; two in Torghar; and one each in Dera Ismail Khan and Lower Kohistan, as reported by The Express Tribune.Officials noted that staffing and operational support for WHO and Unicef programmes in the merged districts were reduced last year, while WHO funding cuts also affected campaign coverage, leaving children in these areas at heightened risk.In Sindh, more than 12,000 children under five were reportedly missed during the final polio drive of 2025 in Hyderabad and surrounding areas, according to The Express Tribune.Refusals were recorded mainly in Cantonment areas and municipal towns such as Hussainabad, Preetabad, Qasimabad, and Tando Jam, with absent households and parental refusals cited as primary reasons.Despite these gaps, the nationwide anti-polio campaign successfully vaccinated more than 44.6 million children across Pakistan, according to The Express Tribune.Punjab led with 22.9 million children vaccinated, followed by Sindh with 10.6 million, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with 7.15 million, and Balochistan with 2.58 million.Officials said contributions from other regions also added to the national tally.Authorities warned that without sustained vaccination efforts, particularly in displaced and high-risk populations, children in the merged districts remain vulnerable to polio, The Express Tribune reported.","Polio vaccination campaign in Pakistan's merged districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa fell short of its target.

Open Letter From Pakistan Backs India As Baloch Leader Signals Diplomatic Break With Islamabad





Baloch leader Mir Yar Baloch has raised a “serious threat” warning over deepening China–Pakistan ties, claiming that China could deploy its military forces in Pakistan’s Balochistan region in the coming months.In an open letter to external affairs minister S Jaishankar, posted on X on New Year’s Day, Mir Yar Baloch said Baloch representatives view the growing strategic partnership between Islamabad and Beijing as “dangerous.”He said Balochistan has “faced decades of repression under Pakistan’s control,” including what he described as “state-sponsored violence” and “human rights abuses.”""The people of Balochistan have endured Pakistan's state occupation, state-sponsored terrorism, and egregious human rights atrocities for the past seventy-nine years. The time has now arrived to eradicate this festering affliction at its roots, ensuring lasting peace and sovereignty for our nation, "" he wrote.In his letter to EAM Jaishankar, Mir Yar Baloch said that China and Pakistan are rapidly moving toward the final stages of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a major Belt and Road Initiative project led by Chinese President Xi Jinping that passes through Balochistan.“The Republic of Balochistan views the escalating strategic alliance between Pakistan and China as profoundly dangerous.We warn that China, in collaboration with Pakistan, has advanced the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) to its final phases,” he said.He warned that unless Baloch resistance and defence forces are strengthened, the region could soon see direct Chinese military involvement.“Should the capabilities of Balochistan's defense and freedom forces not be further bolstered and if they continue to be overlooked as per longstanding patterns, it is conceivable that China could deploy its military forces in Balochistan within a few months,” the letter stated.Mir Yar Baloch also said that any Chinese troop deployment without the approval of the local people could have serious consequences for the region.“The presence of Chinese boots on Balochistani soil without the will of the 60 million Baloch people would pose an unimaginable threat and challenge to the futures of both Bharat and Balochistan,” he wrote.China and Pakistan have repeatedly rejected claims that CPEC has a military angle, saying the project is only economic. India, however, has always opposed CPEC, pointing out that it passes through Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir and affects India’s sovereignty and security.Earlier this year in the Rajya Sabha, minister of state for external affairs Kirti Vardhan Singh repeated India’s stance. In a written reply, he said: “Government's position on CPEC is clear and consistent. Government has consistently protested to parties concerned over the inclusion of the so-called 'China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)', which passes through parts of the Indian Union Territories of Ladakh and Jammu & Kashmir under illegal occupation of Pakistan, as a flagship project of 'OBOR/BRI' and asked them to cease these activities. Any proposed participation of third countries or expansion of the so-called CPEC projects to third countries is unacceptable.”Mir Yar Baloch also praised India’s recent counterterror military actions, highlighting Operation Sindoor, which targeted key terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir after the Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 people.“We commend the bold and resolute actions undertaken by the Modi Government in the previous year through Operation Sindoor, particularly targeting terrorism hubs facilitated by Pakistan and directed against the Pakistani military in response to Pahalgam terror attack. These measures demonstrate exemplary courage and a steadfast commitment to regional security and justice,” he wrote.There has been no official response so far from the Union government, or from Chinese or Pakistani authorities, to Mir Yar Baloch’s claims.",Baloch leader Mir Yar Baloch has raised a “serious threat” warning over deepening China–Pakistan ties.

Why the annual exchange matters



Historical context



Limits of the agreement







NEW DELHI: India and Pakistan on Thursday exchanged, through diplomatic channels, the list of nuclear installations and facilities covered under the Agreement on the Prohibition of Attack against Nuclear Installations and Facilities, the ministry of external affairs said.The exchange took place simultaneously in New Delhi and Islamabad, in keeping with the provisions of the bilateral agreement that governs the protection of nuclear infrastructure in both countries.According to the MEA, the agreement requires India and Pakistan to inform each other of the nuclear installations and facilities covered under the pact on 1 January of every calendar year. Thursday’s exchange marked the 35th consecutive exchange of such lists, with the first taking place on 1 January 1992.The annual exchange has continued uninterrupted for over three decades, even during periods of heightened political and military tension between the two neighbours.The Agreement on the Prohibition of Attack against Nuclear Installations and Facilities was signed on 31 December 1988 and entered into force on 27 January 1991, following the exchange of instruments of ratification by both sides.Under the agreement, both India and Pakistan commit themselves to refrain from undertaking, encouraging or participating in any action aimed at causing destruction of, or damage to, nuclear installations or facilities in the other country.The scope of the agreement is broad. Nuclear installations and facilities covered under the pact include nuclear power plants, research reactors, fuel fabrication units, uranium enrichment facilities, isotope separation plants, reprocessing units and sites storing significant quantities of radioactive material, whether fresh or irradiated.The agreement also specifies that both countries must exchange information on the locations of these facilities, typically in the form of latitude and longitude coordinates, once every year.The annual exchange of lists is designed to reduce the risk of accidental, miscalculated or deliberate attacks on sensitive nuclear infrastructure during periods of conflict or crisis.By formally identifying protected sites, the agreement seeks to prevent scenarios in which conventional military operations could inadvertently escalate into a nuclear crisis. An attack on a nuclear installation, even with conventional weapons, could have catastrophic humanitarian, environmental and strategic consequences.Security analysts view the exchange as a confidence-building measure that helps maintain a minimum level of predictability between two nuclear-armed neighbours with a long history of conflict.Notably, the exchange has continued even during times of strained relations, including after major crises such as the Kargil conflict, the 2001–02 military standoff, the 2016 Uri attack and the 2019 Pulwama attack and Balakot air strikes.When the agreement was negotiated in the late 1980s, both India and Pakistan were moving steadily towards overt nuclear capability, though neither had yet conducted nuclear tests. Concerns over pre-emptive strikes on nuclear facilities, particularly in the context of regional instability, were central to the discussions.The agreement was one of the earliest formal nuclear confidence-building measures between the two countries and predated their 1998 nuclear tests, after which both openly declared themselves nuclear weapon states.Since entering into force in 1991, the agreement has remained intact despite the absence of progress on broader nuclear arms control or risk-reduction mechanisms in South Asia.While the pact prohibits attacks on nuclear installations and facilities, it does not restrict the development, deployment or use of nuclear weapons themselves. Nor does it include verification mechanisms beyond the annual exchange of lists.The agreement also does not cover missile bases, command and control centres or other strategic military assets linked to nuclear weapons.Even so, diplomats and experts argue that the continued observance of the agreement reflects a shared recognition of the dangers posed by attacks on nuclear infrastructure.More than three decades after it came into force, the agreement remains one of the few enduring pillars of nuclear risk reduction between India and Pakistan.In an environment marked by limited dialogue and recurring tensions, the uninterrupted annual exchange of nuclear installation lists serves as a reminder that both sides continue to acknowledge the need to prevent catastrophic escalation.For now, the routine exchange remains a rare example of sustained institutional cooperation between the two countries in the nuclear domain.","India and Pakistan exchange list of nuclear installations and facilities covered under the Agreement on the Prohibition of Attack against Nuclear Installations and Facilities.

ISLAMABAD: Traders across Pakistan have threatened a nationwide shutdown on January 16 if the government does not withdraw its decision to make the installation of Point of Sale (POS) machines mandatory, warning that the move would further burden small businesses and open new avenues for harassment by tax officials, as reported by Dawn.According to Dawn, the warning came during a protest rally held in Islamabad, where traders attempted to march from Aabpara Chowk towards the Red Zone to demonstrate against the Federal Board of Revenue's (FBR) directive.However, heavy police deployment stopped the procession near the Serena Hotel, forcing demonstrators to hold a sit-in at the spot.The protest was organised by the All Pakistan Anjuman-i-Tajran in collaboration with the Traders Action Committee and drew participation from shopkeepers and market representatives from Islamabad and Rawalpindi.Leaders of various trader bodies addressed the gathering, accusing the government of targeting small businesses instead of addressing large-scale corruption.Addressing the crowd, Ajmal Baloch, president of the Traders Action Committee in Islamabad, described the compulsory installation of POS machines as a ""black law"" designed to intimidate traders rather than reform the tax system.He claimed that under the guise of documentation, traders would be exposed to greater harassment and bribery demands by tax officials.Citing an International Monetary Fund assessment, Baloch alleged that corruption in Pakistan amounts to nearly PKR 53 trillion annually, with the FBR accounting for a major share.He accused the department of selectively targeting small shopkeepers while ignoring large-scale corruption.He also alleged that many FBR officials own assets beyond their known sources of income and that their families enjoy foreign education and luxurious lifestyles.The protest leaders also highlighted alleged irregularities in customs operations, claiming that consignments of legally imported goods had been seized and partially returned, while the rest allegedly disappeared, as highlighted by Dawn.Warning of tougher action ahead, the traders announced that if the government attempted to forcibly install POS machines or seal shops, they would block a major arterial road in Islamabad and stage a sit-in at Zero Point on January 16.They further threatened a countrywide shutdown strike if their demands were ignored.The protesters appealed to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to intervene and protect traders from what they described as arbitrary and heavy-handed actions by tax authorities, as reported by Dawn.","Traders across Pakistan have threatened a nationwide shutdown on January 16 if the government does not withdraw its decision to make the installation of Point of Sale (POS) machines mandatory.

Pakistan army chief field marshal Asim Munir hosted his daughter’s wedding last week in the garrison city of Rawalpindi, where she was married to her first cousin, Abdul Rehman, according to Pakistani media reports.The ceremony was attended by senior political leaders and top military officials but was kept low-key due to security considerations, with no official photographs released.Among those present at the ceremony were Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari, prime minister Shehbaz Sharif, deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar, Punjab chief minister Maryam Nawaz, the chief of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), and several serving and retired senior army officers, including former army chiefs.Pakistani journalist Zahid Gishkori said around 400 guests attended the event, which was deliberately kept subdued.Gishkori, in a video posted on social media platform YouTube, confirmed the family connection between the bride and groom. “Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir's daughter Mahnoor married his brother's son, ex-army captain turned civil servant Abdul Rehman Qasim,” he said.The groom, Abdul Rehman, is Munir’s nephew. According to local media, he previously served in the Pakistan Army as a captain before joining the civil administration through a quota reserved for army officers.He currently serves as an assistant commissioner.Munir has four daughters, and last week's ceremony marked the wedding of his third daughter.The wedding coincided with the arrival of UAE President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan in Pakistan on the same day, prompting speculation on social media about a possible link between the two events.

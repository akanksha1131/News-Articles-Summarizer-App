'MIT wants a free Palestine': Indian-American student Megha Vemuri on Israel's 'genocide' in commencement speech,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/mit-wants-a-free-palestine-indian-american-student-megha-vemuri-israels-genocide-in-commencement-speech/articleshow/121505039.cms,"Indian-American student Megha Vemuri Israel's 'genocide' in commencement speech (Pic credit: @KassyAkiva)





At a politically charged commencement ceremony on Thursday, MIT ’s class of 2025 president Megha Vemuri, an Indian-American student, used her platform to deliver a bold pro-Palestinian message, sharply criticising the university’s ties to Israel and calling on fellow graduates to take a stand.Wearing a red keffiyeh, a symbol of Palestinian solidarity, Vemuri addressed a crowd of graduates, families, and faculty, saying, “You showed the world that MIT wants a free Palestine.”Her remarks came amid ongoing nationwide campus unrest over the war in Gaza and US university connections to defence and research institutions tied to the conflict. In her speech, Vemuri acknowledged the uncertainty gripping academia and the intense pressures faced by student activists.“It is no secret that at this time, academic institutions across the country are shrouded in a dark cloud of uncertainty,” she said. “There is a lot of fear in many of our hearts.”Vemuri pointed to MIT’s research links with the Israeli military as a source of shame and moral conflict for the institution. “The Israeli occupation forces are the only foreign military that MIT has research ties with,” she said. “This means that Israel’s assault on the Palestinian people is not only aided and abetted by our country, but our school.”She noted that both MIT’s undergraduate body and its graduate student union had, in recent months, voted “overwhelmingly to cut ties with the genocidal Israeli military.”“You faced threats, intimidation and suppression coming from all directions, especially your own university officials, but you prevailed,” she told graduates. “Because the MIT community that I know would never tolerate a genocide.”Referring to the destruction of higher education infrastructure in Gaza, Vemuri added: “There are no universities left in Gaza. We are watching Israel try to wipe Palestine off the face of the earth, and it is a shame that MIT is a part of it.”The student leader concluded her address with a symbolic gesture, asking graduates to turn their MIT class rings so that the emblem faced outward—a tradition symbolising their move into the wider world. But her message was pointed.“We carry with us the obligation to do everything we can to stop it,” she said. “MIT is directly complicit in the ongoing genocide of the Palestinian people.”","Megha Vemuri, an Indian-American student, used her platform to deliver a bold pro-Palestinian message.

"Donald Trump rages against court ruling on tariffs, calls on Supreme Court to act quickly",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-rages-against-court-ruling-on-tariffs-calls-on-supreme-court-to-act-quickly/articleshow/121503800.cms,"US President Donald Trump

Disappointment in judicial picks

Tariffs and legal battle continue





US President Donald Trump wrote a fiery post on social media on Thursday night after a federal court ruling challenged the legality of his proposed tariffs, criticising the judiciary and taking aim at prominent conservative legal figures.The controversy stems from a recent decision by the US court of international trade, which on Wednesday ruled that Trump had exceeded his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) in attempting to implement new tariffs. However, a day later, the US court of appeals for the federal circuit issued a temporary stay, allowing the tariffs to remain in place for now.Reacting to the development on Truth Social, Trump blasted the court of international trade’s ruling as “incredible” and politically motivated. “Where do these initial three Judges come from?” Trump wrote. “Is it purely a hatred of ‘TRUMP?’ What other reason could it be?”In a striking departure from usual Republican rhetoric, Trump also lashed out at the Federalist Society, a conservative legal group influential in shaping his judicial nominations during his presidency. He specifically targeted Leonard Leo, co-chairman of the organisation’s board, accusing him of giving “bad advice” and harbouring personal ambitions.“It was suggested that I use The Federalist Society as a recommending source on Judges,” Trump posted. “I did so, openly and freely, but then realized that they were under the thumb of a real ‘sleazebag’ named Leonard Leo, a bad person who, in his own way, probably hates America.”Trump expressed frustration over some of the judges he appointed while in office, blaming the Federalist Society for pushing names that he now regrets. “I am very proud of many of our picks, but very disappointed in others,” he wrote. “They always must do what’s right for the Country!”Trump concluded his lengthy post by reiterating support for his proposed tariffs, which he insists are crucial for America’s economic security. “The ruling by the US Court of International Trade is so wrong, and so political!” he declared, expressing hope that the Supreme Court would overturn the decision “quickly and decisively.”“The President of the United States must be allowed to protect America against those that are doing it Economic and Financial harm,” he added.","US President Donald Trump wrote a fiery post on social media on Thursday night after a federal court ruling challenged the legality of his proposed tariffs.

Macron and Hegseth to address China and the Ukraine war at Singapore security forum,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/macron-and-hegseth-to-address-china-and-the-ukraine-war-at-singapore-security-forum/articleshow/121501766.cms,"US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth (left) and French President Emmanuel Macron (right) (Image credit: AP)





SINGAPORE: French President Emmanuel Macron and US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth are among the world leaders, diplomats and top defence officials in Singapore this weekend for a security forum that will focus on China's growing assertiveness, the global impact of Russia's war on Ukraine and the flare-up of conflicts in Asia.Macron opens the conference with a keynote address Friday night that is expected to touch on all of those issues, as well as the pressure the hefty tariffs announced by President Donald Trump's administration is putting on Asian allies.It's Hegseth's first time to the Shangri-La dialogue, hosted by the International Institute for Security Studies, which is taking place against the backdrop of heightened rhetoric between Beijing and Washington due to the Trump administration's threat of triple digit tariffs on China, and some uncertainty in the region over how committed the US is to the defence of Taiwan, which also faces possible 32 per cent American tariffs.China claims the self-governing democracy as its own, and Chinese President Xi Jinping has not ruled out taking it by force. China sends military aircraft, ships and spy balloons near Taiwan as part of a campaign of daily harassment, and currently has an aircraft carrier in the waters southeast of the island.Hegseth told reporters before he boarded his plane for Singapore that Washington's policies were meant to deter a Chinese invasion of Taiwan.""We seek no conflict with anybody, including the Communist Chinese,"" he said. ""We will stay strong for our interests. And that's a big part of what this trip is all about.""China, which usually sends its defense minister to the Shangri-La forum, appears to be sending a lower-level delegation this year but has not said why.Hegseth's trip to Singapore is his second to the region since becoming defence secretary, following a March visit to the Philippines, which has seen escalating confrontations with China over competing territorial claims in the South China Sea That trip, which also included a stop in Japan, brought a degree of relief over growing concerns from the Philippines and others in the region about US support from a president who has taken more of a transactional approach to diplomacy and seems wary of foreign engagements.The US has been pursuing a ""free and open Indo-Pacific"" policy, which includes regularly sailing warships through the Taiwan Strait and in the South China Sea, which is claimed almost in its entirety by China.The European Union has adopted a more economics-driven approach, but several European nations have also regularly taken part in the freedom of navigation exercises, including France which sent a carrier strike group on a five-month mission through the Indo-Pacific that concluded in April.In its published Indo-Pacific strategy, France has underscored the need to ""preserve a rules-based international order"" in the face of ""China's increasing power and territorial claims"" and its global competition with the United States.France's own ties to the Indo-Pacific are strong, with more than 1.6 million of its citizens living in the region in French overseas territories.In his speech, Macron is expected also to stress that the war in Ukraine is having a worldwide impact and that Russia seeks to destabilize Asia, the French president's office said.While democracies from the region, including Australia, South Korea and Japan, have been aiding Ukraine, China has been growingly supportive of Russia and North Korea has sent troops to fight for Moscow.The conference comes as civil war continues to rage in Myanmar, creating a massive humanitarian crisis that has only been compounded by the effects of a devastating earthquake that hit in March.It also follows the outbreak of violence this week on the Thai-Cambodian border, in which a Cambodian soldier was killed in a brief exchange of fire between the two sides. Thailand and Cambodia have a long history of land disputes, though Thailand said after the short skirmish that the situation had been resolved.Of greater concern, nuclear-armed neighbours India and Pakistan came to the brink of war earlier this month in their most serious military confrontation in decades. The two armies exchanged gunfire, artillery strikes, missiles and drones that killed dozens of people, and Pakistan shot down several Indian planes before the a truce was declared.","French President Emmanuel Macron and US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth are among the world leaders, diplomats and top defence officials in Singapore this weekend.

A Chinese paraglider had a miraculous escape after being swept nearly 29,000 feet into the sky by a powerful updraft over the Qilian Mountains in Gansu Province.Peng Yujiang, an experienced B-level paraglider, was testing a second-hand harness on Saturday when the wind suddenly picked up and lifted him high into the upper atmosphere — without any oxygen equipment.“I had just bought a second-hand paragliding harness and wanted to test it, so I was conducting ground parachute shaking,” Peng told China Central Television (CCTV). “After a while, the wind suddenly picked up and lifted me into the air. I tried to land as soon as possible, but I failed.”Amateur video aired by Chinese state media showed Peng drifting through thick clouds, his face and clothing caked in ice as he battled the freezing conditions at an altitude of 8,598 metres (28,208 feet).He described being trapped inside dense cumulonimbus clouds and completely disoriented. “It was terrifying — everything around me was white. Without the compass, I wouldn’t have known which direction I was heading. I thought I was flying straight, but in reality, I was spinning,” he said.Despite nearly losing consciousness and losing feeling in his hands due to the cold, Peng managed to navigate his way out using his compass and stayed in contact with teammates via radio.“As soon as I came out of the clouds, I was very excited because I had survived,” he recalled. “The scariest moment was when I tried to pull out of the spiral and failed and when the canopy nosedived. It’s still frightening to think about.”Peng, who has been paragliding for over four years, said the experience has left him shaken. “I’m not sure about the future, but for now I definitely won’t fly for a while,” he added.","Peng Yujiang, an experienced B-level paraglider, was testing a second-hand harness on Saturday when the wind suddenly picked up and lifted him high into the upper atmosphere.

Russia Signs Big Deal With Pak, Assures Big Help Amid Ongoing Tensions





A Russian deputy mayor and prominent veteran of Moscow’s war in Ukraine was killed in a suspected bombing in southern Russia, officials confirmed on Thursday.The 34 year old Zaur Aleksandrovich Gurtsiev died in an early morning explosion on a street in Stavropol, along with another man. The blast was caused by a “homemade explosive device,” as per investigators cited by CNN.Russia’s Investigative Committee said “As part of the investigation, the scene of the incident is being inspected, examinations are being ordered, and the necessary investigative actions are being carried out to establish all the circumstances of the incident.”Stavropol region governor Vladimir Vladimirov said on Telegram that “all versions are being considered, including the organisation of a terrorist attack” possibly linked to Ukraine.Gurtsiev had risen to prominence through the Kremlin-backed “Time of Heroes” programme, launched by President Vladimir Putin to promote war veterans into public office. According to the programme’s website, Gurtsiev led aerial operations during Russia’s controversial siege of Mariupol in 2022.“He introduced his developments in the technology of targeting missiles, which allowed them to increase their accuracy and effectiveness many times over, including hitting the Azov supply base,” the site states.The capture of Mariupol followed an 86-day siege that left much of the city in ruins. UN estimates suggest 90% of residential buildings were either damaged or destroyed, with around 350,000 people forced to flee. Ukrainian officials claim up to 20,000 civilians were killed, though that figure remains unverified.Gurtsiev’s death comes amid a string of attacks on Russian military figures inside the country. Last month, authorities arrested an alleged Ukrainian agent in connection with a car bomb that killed General Yaroslav Moskalik, a top officer in Russia’s military command.In February, Armen Sarkisyan, a pro-Russian militia leader in eastern Ukraine, died in a bombing in central Moscow.","Zaur Aleksandrovich Gurtsiev died in an early morning explosion on a street in Stavropol, along with another man.

What does Israel want?

What does Hamas want?





Israel has agreed to a new US-backed proposal for a temporary ceasefire with Hamas, the White House confirmed on Thursday, in what could mark a major step toward halting the devastating war in Gaza and securing the release of more hostages.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that Israel has “backed and supported” the plan, which came after recent efforts by US President Donald Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff.Witkoff had earlier expressed cautious optimism about mediating a breakthrough deal, which would pause hostilities and pave the way for the return of hostages captured.In a statement, Hamas said it had received the proposal and was “reviewing it responsibly to serve the interests of our people, provide them relief, and achieve a permanent ceasefire in the Gaza Strip.”Previously, Hamas had said it reached a “general framework” agreement with the US envoy, outlining steps toward a lasting ceasefire. The framework included a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, increased humanitarian aid, and a handover of governance from Hamas to a politically independent Palestinian committee.More than 54,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, have been killed since Israel resumed its military offensive in March, according to Gaza health officials.The October 7 attack by Hamas, which triggered the conflict, left 1,200 Israelis dead and 251 taken hostage.Although the full details of the proposal have not been made public, sources close to the negotiations say that the ceasefire would see Israeli troops pull back to earlier positions and allow for the release of 10 living hostages and several bodies in exchange for over 1,100 Palestinian prisoners, including those 100 serving long sentences on conviction of the deadly attacks.It also calls for a 60-day halt in fighting. Notably, the plan includes the assurance that Israel will not resume military operations once the hostages are freed.Hundreds of aid trucks would also be allowed into Gaza each day during the truce, a vital lifeline for a population suffering under a months-long blockade that has brought many to the brink of famine.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has long maintained that the war will not end until all hostages are freed and Hamas is either dismantled or forced into exile. He also declared that Israel will retain long-term control over Gaza and promote what he describes as the voluntary emigration of a large portion of its population.However, plans to resettle Gaza’s population have been firmly rejected by Palestinians and much of the international community, with experts warning that such a move would likely breach international law.Hamas has made clear it will release the remaining hostages, its sole leverage, only in exchange for the release of more Palestinian prisoners, a permanent ceasefire, and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. The group has also signalled its willingness to relinquish control to a politically independent Palestinian committee that would lead reconstruction efforts.Hamas is still holding 58 hostages, of which only a third are believed to be living. However, As the war lingers on, their lives continue to be in danger.","Israel has agreed to a new US-backed proposal for a temporary ceasefire with Hamas, the White House confirmed on Thursday.

Fake citations and AI concerns

White House sidesteps AI questions

Mixed reception from medical community





US President Donald Trump administration's report on children’s health, touted as a “clear, evidence-based foundation” for policy action, is under scrutiny after it was found to contain multiple fabricated citations. The controversial report, issued last week by the presidential Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) Commission, referenced studies that do not exist and misattributed authorship to real researchers.The report, which was meant to guide federal action on children’s health concerns such as mental illness, asthma medication, and the impact of drug advertising, has now drawn widespread criticism from experts for lacking academic rigour.Among the false references was a study supposedly authored by Columbia University epidemiologist Katherine Keyes. The paper, which the report cited on adolescent mental health and substance use, does not exist, and Keyes herself denied ever having written it.""It makes me concerned about the rigour of the report, if these really basic citation practices aren't being followed,"" Keyes told reporters.The discrepancies were first exposed by the news outlet NOTUS and further investigated by The New York Times, which uncovered additional faulty references. In response, the White House uploaded a revised version of the report with corrected citations by Thursday afternoon.Medical journalism expert Dr Ivan Oransky, co-founder of the watchdog site Retraction Watch, said the nature of the errors suggested the use of generative artificial intelligence.At a Thursday press briefing, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt deflected questions about the report's preparation, referring inquiries to the department of health and human services (HHS).Emily Hilliard, a spokesperson for HHS, did not confirm whether AI had been used but dismissed the citation issues as “minor citation and formatting errors.”“The substance of the MAHA report remains the same — a historic and transformative assessment by the federal government to understand the chronic disease epidemic afflicting our nation's children,” Hilliard said.While some health researchers support the report’s critiques of synthetic chemicals and ultraprocessed foods in the American diet, others are deeply concerned about its claims. Notably, the report suggests that routine childhood vaccines could be harmful, a claim widely disputed by scientists and public health officials who argue it reflects a flawed understanding of immunology.The revelation of fake citations has only deepened scepticism. “It undermines confidence in the report’s findings,” said Keyes.","Report on children's health cited studies that do not exist and misattributed authorship to real researchers.

Target: 3,000 arrests a day

Homeland security: Leadership changes will help fulfill mandate

ICE staff urged to stay the course





In the latest wave of leadership changes at US immigration and customs enforcement (ICE), several senior officials are stepping down or shifting roles, the agency announced on Thursday. This marks the third major leadership shake-up at the agency in recent months, amid mounting pressure from US President Donald Trump's administration to significantly ramp up deportations.Kenneth Genalo, ICE’s top deportation official, is retiring, while his deputy, Garrett Ripa, will return to a regional leadership post in Florida. Meanwhile, Robert Hammer, who led the agency's homeland security investigations (HSI) division, is being reassigned within ICE.These changes come as the Trump administration continues to struggle to fulfil Trump’s campaign promises of mass deportations. Despite bolstering efforts with personnel from other federal law enforcement agencies, ICE has been constrained by limited resources.The leadership overhaul was announced just a day after senior White House advisor Stephen Miller told Fox News that the administration had set an ambitious new target: 3,000 ICE arrests per day, more than four times the current rate.ICE had made over 66,000 arrests in the first 100 days of Trump’s presidency, averaging about 660 per day.“We are looking to set a goal of a minimum of 3,000 arrests for ICE every day,” Miller said. “President Trump is going to keep pushing to get that number up higher each and every single day.”Echoing the urgency, top immigration official Tom Homan told reporters Thursday, “I’m not satisfied with the numbers. We need to increase.”The department of homeland security defended the leadership changes, calling them necessary to deliver on Trump’s hardline immigration agenda.“Organizational realignments will help ICE achieve President Trump and the American people’s mandate of arresting and deporting criminal illegal aliens and making American communities safe,” the department said in a statement.Thursday’s shake-up follows the February removal of two other senior officials overseeing deportation efforts. Soon after, ICE’s acting director Caleb Vitello was also removed from his position.Amid growing uncertainty and operational demands, ICE’s acting leader Todd Lyons sent a message of support to staff on Thursday.“I say this with complete understanding that change is hard — but please know that our entire leadership team is here to support you,” Lyons wrote in an internal email obtained by The New York Times. “I’m proud to work alongside each of you, and I will always have your backs.”","Kenneth Genalo, ICE’s top deportation official, is retiring, while his deputy, Garrett Ripa, will return to a regional leadership post in Florida.

Trump's tariffs to remain in effect after court grants stay - REUTERS





US President Donald Trump on Thursday received temporary approval to continue collecting tariffs under emergency powers, just a day after a separate court ruled that he had exceeded his authority by imposing sweeping levies on foreign imports.The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit allowed the April 2 tariffs to remain in place while the White House appeals the trade court’s decision.""The request for an immediate administrative stay is granted to the extent that the judgments and the permanent injunctions entered by the Court of International Trade in these cases are temporarily stayed until further notice while this court considers the motions papers,"" the court's order said, cited by The Independent.Earlier on Wednesday, the US court of international trade had ruled that Trump unlawfully invoked emergency powers under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to declare a national emergency and slap tariffs on imports from nearly every country in the world. However, the Trump administration protested the court's ruling, initiating an appeal proceeding against the decision.The ruling came as a major blow to Trump, whose turbulent trade policies rattled global markets, triggered supply chain chaos, and sparked concerns about inflation and sluggish growth.Trump’s tariff policies are challenged in at least seven lawsuits. The US court of international trade's ruling stemmed from two combined cases: one from a group of five small businesses, and another from 12 US states.“The reason that he chose IEEPA was he thought he could do this unilaterally without much oversight by Congress,” said Jeffrey Schwab, senior counsel at the Liberty Justice Center, who represented the small businesses. “The court saw through that.”In its decision, the trade court pointed out that America has run trade deficits for nearly 50 years, hardly an urgent or unforeseen crisis.Another judge, US district Judge Rudolph Contreras, also issued a narrower ruling on Thursday blocking tariffs applied to two Illinois-based educational toy companies, further complicating the president’s strategy.The original IEEPA tariffs, introduced on what Trump called ""Liberation Day,"" included up to 50 per cent duties on countries with trade surpluses against the US, and a 10 per cent baseline tariff for most others. Though Trump paused the steeper levies for 90 days to allow time for negotiation, he kept the lower ones in place.","The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit allowed the April 2 tariffs to remain in place while the White House appeals the trade court’s decision.

Authorities in Tamaulipas, northeastern Mexico, have discovered five bodies during the search for members of a local band feared to have been kidnapped.The musicians, aged between 20 and 40, disappeared on Sunday after last being seen at a bar in the city of Reynosa, close to the US border. According to relatives, they had received ransom demands following the disappearance, AFP reported.State officials confirmed the discovery on Thursday, saying, “Investigations led to an area where five bodies were located.” The statement, released via social media, added that the remains are believed to match the “preliminary characteristics” of the missing members of the band Fugitivo.The group had reportedly been hired for a concert, but family members said the location turned out to be a deserted lot. Loved ones have since staged protests, urging officials to intervene more swiftly.“We’ve been receiving extortion calls,” said the sister of one of the missing musicians, speaking anonymously due to safety concerns.Tamaulipas is one of Mexico’s most dangerous regions, plagued by criminal groups involved in drug trafficking, people smuggling, and extortion. Musicians in the country have previously been targeted by cartels who pay them to sing about their exploits.Since 2006, criminal violence in Mexico has claimed over 480,000 lives and left around 120,000 people missing.","Musicians aged between 20 and 40 disappeared on Sunday.

MAGA activist Laura Loomer threatened that she will confront Chinese president Xi Jinping 's daughter who lives in Massachusetts, protected by PLA guards. ""Communists don't belong in our country. I think I'm going to confront her on video and ask her about her father,"" Laura Loomer said as US announced a major crackdown on Chinese students.Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced Wednesday that the US will begin revoking visas of Chinese students, including those with connections to the Chinese Commuist Party or studying in critical fields. Rubio said that the visa criteria for China and Hong Kong will be revised and some strict scrutiny will be imposed.Xi Jinping's daughter studied I Harvard in 2010 under a pseudonym. Xi Mingze studied French at Hangzhou Foreign Language School (2006–2008) and briefly attended Zhejiang University before enrolling at Harvard University in 2010 under a pseudonym. She graduated in 2014 with a Bachelor of Arts in psychology and reportedly returned to Beijing. There are unverified claims that she returned to Harvard for graduate studies in 2019.Xi Mingze’s low profile is a deliberate CCP strategy to shield her from scrutiny.

In 2022, US epresentative Vicky Hartzler claimed Xi Mingze was living in the US though there is no confirmation on whether she lives in the US or China.

Referring to the Indus Water Treaty (IWT), Pakistan Army chief, General Asim Munir, on Thursday described it as a ""red line"" for his country and declared that Islamabad would ""never compromise"" on the water issue.Munir made the remarks while talking to vice-chancellors of different universities, principals, and senior teachers and educators, according to the army.“Water is Pakistan's red line, and we will not allow any compromise on this basic right of 240 million (24 crore) Pakistanis,” he said, speaking about India's move to keep the IWT in abeyance following last month's Pahalgam terrorist attack.Pakistani leaders have repeatedly threatened India over New Delhi's suspension of the Indus treaty. Signed in September 1960, the agreement stands suspended for the first time.Tensions between the two rivals soared after the April 22 attack, in which Pakistan-backed terrorists killed 26 men in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam. The victims included 25 tourists and a local.India carried out precision strikes as part of Operation Sindoor on terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir in the early hours of May 7.It was followed by Pakistan’s attempt to attack Indian military bases on May 8, 9, and 10.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif wrapped up a five-day, four-nation diplomatic tour in Tajikistan on Thursday, aiming to bolster regional ties and challenge India's terrorism accusations.The tour, spanning Iran, Turkiye, Azerbaijan, and Tajikistan, came after a tense military standoff with India earlier this month. Joined by Field Marshal Asim Munir and foreign minister Ishaq Dar, Sharif sought to project Pakistan as a peace-seeking nation amid rising regional friction.The tour's backdrop was a May 9-10 clash. Media outlets posted on Thursday videos of Sharif, during his Azerbaijan visit, purportedly admitting to India's preemptive BrahMos missile strikes on Pakistani military sites impeding Pakistan's attempts to retaliate. However, neither Pakistani outlets nor Azerbaijan's government have confirmed Sharif's statement about BrahMos. TOI was unable to independently verify the authenticity of the video.Sharif's mission was clear: counter India's global push - visiting over 30 countries to brand Pakistan a terror sponsor, a charge Islamabad rejects. In Azerbaijan, he stressed Pakistan's willingness to discuss Kashmir and terrorism with India, saying, ""If India engages sincerely, we're ready.""This stance, reiterated in Tajikistan, framed Pakistan as a peace broker while painting India as belligerent. Talks with Turkiye's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev aimed to lock in support against India's rhetoric.In Tajikistan, Sharif shifted focus to economic and security ties with Central Asia, a region where India and Pakistan compete for sway. The tour, just two weeks after the standoff, reflects Pakistan's haste to reshape its image. Yet, India's narrative of counterterrorism retains global traction.With a fragile pause in conflict hanging in the balance, the Pakistan PM's peace calls face an uphill battle against India's military-first approach. Meetings in Turkiye and beyond highlighted Pakistan's reliance on allies to offset India's influence. Still, the tour's success hinges on whether these overtures can pierce India's diplomatic armor.The broader India-Pakistan rivalry played out vividly here - diplomacy and perception as fiercely contested as their borders. Sharif's tour, while crisp in intent, navigates a murky web of unverified claims, strategic posturing, and regional ambitions, leaving the path to peace as elusive as ever.","Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif wrapped up a five-day, four-nation diplomatic tour in Tajikistan on Thursday.

NEW DELHI: Top Lashkar-e-Taiba commander and one of the plotters of the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack Saifullah Kasuri made inflammatory remarks against India at a rally in Lahore on Wednesday. Surrounded by Pakistani security forces, fellow terrorist commanders and officials of Pakistan's intelligence agency, ISI, Kasuri seemed to relish the infamy he had attracted for the massacre of innocent civilians marked out on the basis of their faith.""I have become more famous since being accused of the attack,"" he gloated, as per information reaching here.Kasuri, who had earlier disclaimed responsibility for the slaughter in Pahalgam, was sharing the stage with US-designated terrorist Talha Saeed, son of Lashkar chief Hafiz Saeed , along with Malik Ahmad Khan, speaker of the Punjab assembly - something that once again laid bare Pakistan's claim of having taken action against terrorists.Talha publicly lauded Pakistan's so called Bunyan al-Marsoos operation, in retaliation to India's Operation Sindoor. ""Allah loves those who engage in jihad,"" he said while Kasuri and others cheered.The speeches appeared to be meant to rally members of the jihadi outfit after India's successful precision strikes on the Lashkar headquarters in Muridke which killed several terrorists.In an apparent reference to PM Narendra Modi's remarks a few days ago, Kasuri said they were not afraid of bullets.""Narendra Modi samajhta hai hum goliyon se darne wale hain? Ye uski bhool hai (Modi is mistaken if he thinks we are scared of bullets),"" he said. Addressing at a rally at Bhuj earlier this week, the PM had said Pakistan should be ready to face India's bullets if it did not stop using terror as a weapon.Kasuri had earlier claimed that he had no role to play in the Pahalgam carnage. On Wednesday, he was all fire and brimstone.While claiming that Pakistan had avenged the 1971 war and the vivisection of Pakistan by the then PM Indira Gandhi, Kasuri went on to praise Pakistan's cyber team for 'targeting' India's critical infrastructure pertaining to communications and railways.During the rally, he also referenced the upcoming elections and asked the people of Kasur (his hometown) if they'd support him running against Modi in the next election. He styled himself as a thorn in India's side. ""Main rehta hun Hindustan ke dil me kaante ki tarah. Apne rab ka shukr karta hu. Agla election Modi ke muqable mai na lad lun,"" he said.He also said that India had tried a lot to isolate Pakistan and specific individuals, but now it was they who stood isolated. Kasuri was spotted in Kanganpur army base in Punjab in the run-up to the Pahalgam attack where he exhorted Pakistani soldiers and spewed venom against India.On Hafiz Saeed's instructions, Kasuri, Talha and Sheikh Sajjad Gul of The Resistance Front are learned to have sent in highly trained terrorists for a ""spectacular attack' in Pahalgam.Kasuri, who was earlier president of Milli Muslim League, was also part of Jamaat-ud-Dawa's coordination committee, the 'charity' wing of Lashkar.

Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has publicly admitted, once again that Indian missiles, including the supersonic BrahMos, struck multiple locations deep inside Pakistan, including an airport in Rawalpindi.Speaking at a trilateral summit in Lachin, Azerbaijan, Sharif described how Indian strikes hit multiple targets in Pakistan before it could mount its planned retaliation.Speaking at the Pakistan-Turkiye-Azerbaijan Trilateral Summit in Lachin, Azerbaijan, Sharif described the sequence of events and Pakistan's intended response. ""We on 9th and 10th night we decided to respond in a measured fashion to Indian aggression,"" he said.""And we had decided that at 4:30 in the morning after Fajr prayers, Pakistan armed forces led very ably by our Field Marshal Chief Army Staff sitting here, Syed Asam Munir to teach a lesson to our enemy. But before that hour reached India again launched missile attacks, BrahMos and hit Pakistan's various provinces including airport in Rawalpindi and other places.""This is not the first time that Sharif has confirmed that Operation Sindoor caused severe damage in Pakistan, earlier speaking at a ceremony the Pakistani PM had acknowledged that Indian missiles struck Nur Khan Airbase in Rawalpindi and other locations.Earlier, speaking at a ceremony, he said, “At around 2.30am on May 10, General Syed Asim Munir called me on secure line and informed me that India's ballistic missiles have hit Nur Khan Airbase and other areas.”Operation Sindoor, launched by India on May following the Pahalgam terror attack, targeted terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan and PoK, killing over 100 militants. The strikes targeted nine terror launchpads in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, and was followed by the destruction of 11 Pakistani airbases after failed attempts by Pakistan to target Indian military positions.The situation de-escalated only after both sides agreed to a halt in military actions during a meeting between the Directors General of Military Operations on May 10.In the aftermath, Sharif had also made repeated appeals for dialogue, calling for talks on peace, terrorism, water, and Kashmir. Speaking in Tehran earlier this week, Sharif had said, “We want to resolve all disputes, including the Kashmir issue and the water issue, through negotiations and are also ready to talk to our neighbour on trade and counter-terrorism.” However, he warned, “But if they choose to remain aggressors, then we shall defend our territory… like we have done a few days ago. ”India has firmly rejected these overtures. At a press briefing, mministry of external affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal reaffirmed New Delhi’s position, stating, “Terrorism and talks cannot go together… Talks on J&K will be held only on the vacating of PoK and when Pakistan hands over the territory to us.”He also confirmed that the Indus Waters Treaty will remain suspended until Pakistan “credibly and irrevocably abjures its support to cross-border terrorism”, adding, “Water and blood cannot flow together.”","Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif has publicly admitted, once again that Indian missiles, including the supersonic BrahMos, struck multiple locations deep inside Pakistan.

In a video which has gone viral on social media, Pakistani actor Hina Bayat highlighted the issue of lack water at Pakistan's busiest Jinnah International Airport, in the country's largest city, Karachi.In the video, Bayat said, ""Today is Youm-e-Takbir. I am standing here at Karachi International Airport, and on a day when we should be celebrating Pakistan’s achievements, I see that there is no water in any of the washrooms here.

And no one is willing to admit these are mistakes which need to be fixed. So many new projects are being launched, new trains are being discussed — but the old systems, like availability of water in the washrooms of an international airport, are being ignored.It’s truly unfortunate,"" she added.The video went viral on Indian social media, as it comes in the backdrop of India putting in abeyance the Indus Water Treaty with Pakistan.Putting the water agreement in abeyance is among several diplomatic and military steps taken by India in retaliation to the terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam.

Families allege ‘fake encounter’ after three missing men found dead in Balochistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/families-allege-fake-encounter-after-three-missing-men-found-dead-in-balochistan/articleshow/121437104.cms,"



A fresh wave of suspected fake encounters in Balochistan has led to public anger, as rights activists accuse security forces of killing people in custody and staging the events to look like clashes.Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) on Monday claimed it had killed three militants in an operation in the Tang Kiryar area of Barkhan district. The bodies of Abdul Rehman Buzdar, Fareed Buzdar, and Sultan Marri were later shifted to the Basic Health Unit hospital in Rakni.However, the families of the deceased and Baloch rights groups strongly disputed the official account. They said all three had been missing for months, victims of enforced disappearance, and insisted the encounter was fake.The activists alleged that ""the men were executed after being kept in illegal detention.”A CTD spokesperson said that the men died during an exchange of fire and that weapons were recovered from the scene. But this version of events has been widely rejected.In a separate incident, another youth, Ghaus Bakhsh, was found dead in Awaran district’s Kolwah tehsil. He had reportedly been summoned to a nearby military camp, and his body was discovered just hours later, bearing visible signs of torture.This added to growing suspicions of custodial killings.The Balochistan Post reported both incidents, saying the deaths follow a pattern seen in other districts such as Dukki, Ziarat and Quetta. In those cases too, individuals who had previously gone missing later turned up dead in what were officially described as security operations.Human rights groups and Baloch activists say these cases point to a disturbing trend of state-led violence. They are calling for independent investigations and international attention to ensure accountability. “This is part of a systematic campaign,” said one rights campaigner. “There needs to be an end to the impunity,"" they added.",Rights activists accuse security forces of killing people in custody and staging the events to look like clashes.

Poll Do you believe that climate change is contributing to extreme weather events in Pakistan? Yes No





At least 14 people were killed and more than 100 injured after powerful windstorms swept across central and northern Pakistan following a days-long heatwave, officials confirmed on Sunday.The storms, described as “particularly destructive” by authorities, battered the provinces of Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa as well as Islamabad on Saturday afternoon and evening.Mazhar Hussain, spokesperson for the Punjab disaster management authority, was quoted by news agency AFP as saying, “This windstorm was particularly destructive. The wind speed was very high. There was so much dust in it that visibility was greatly reduced.”According to him, the extreme weather followed several days of intense heat, with temperatures exceeding 45°C. “There were three to four days in the recent heatwave where temperatures went up quite a lot,” he added, attributing the sudden storm to the intense build-up of heat.The majority of casualties were caused by collapsing roofs and walls, while at least two people died after being struck by solar panels dislodged by high-speed winds.In one tragic incident, lightning claimed the life of one man and injured three others.The storms uprooted trees, knocked over electric poles, and caused significant damage to vehicles and infrastructure. Social media was flooded with dramatic videos showing the aftermath, including a viral clip filmed inside a passenger plane struggling to land in Lahore before being diverted to Karachi amid severe turbulence.Islamabad and surrounding areas have also seen multiple unusual hailstorms over April and May, damaging vehicles and solar panels—marking a growing trend of erratic and extreme weather events in the country.Pakistan is widely recognised as one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change, with early summers and intense heatwaves becoming increasingly common.India is also battling extreme temperatures. According to news agency ANI, Rajasthan's Jaisalmer hit 48°C, forcing locals indoors. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) warned that severe heatwave conditions will continue in Rajasthan until May 27 and in Punjab, Haryana, and Jammu and Kashmir until May 26.Meanwhile, heavy monsoon rainfall has already arrived on India’s west coast, with IMD forecasting intense downpours over Kerala, Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Goa in the coming week.Back in Pakistan, the Meteorological Department has predicted more storms on Sunday, raising concerns about further damage and casualties.","Powerful windstorms swept across central and northern Pakistan following a days- long heatwave.

Abdul Latif Baloch, a well-known journalist in Pakistan's Balochistan province, was shot dead inside his home in Mashkay, in the wee hours of Saturday.The Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC), a local rights group, confirmed that he was shot by state-backed armed groups at around 3 am, in front of his wife and children, reported news agency ANI.Latif was respected for his fearless coverage of human rights abuses and military operations in Balochistan. His work focused on enforced disappearances, extrajudicial killings, and the struggle of ordinary Baloch citizens. His death underlines the extreme risk faced by reporters in Pakistan.This incident comes just months after his son, Saif Baloch, and seven other family members were reportedly abducted by security forces and later found dead. Activists describe these patterns of violence as part of Pakistan’s “kill and dump” policy, used to silence dissent and suppress the Baloch identity.Shalee Baloch of the Baloch Women Forum described the killing as part of “systemic violence” against the Baloch people. She urged international organisations and media to intervene, saying silence from the global community is enabling further bloodshed.Human rights groups and press freedom organisations have condemned the assassination and are calling for urgent international pressure on Pakistan with regard to Balochistan.

Jailed former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan has ruled out any negotiations with Pakistan's civilian government, declaring that only talks with the country’s military establishment are meaningful.In a post on X, Khan said, “Engaging in any talks with the puppet Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) government is pointless. This illegitimate Form-47 installed government has already wasted two months. Its only objective is to cling to false authority. It holds no real power.”Khan, who has been behind bars since August 2023 in multiple cases following the collapse of his government in April 2022, stressed that negotiations would only be held with those who actually “hold power”, the military establishment, and only in the national interest.“I do not fear hardship as my resolve remains strong,” he said, while alleging that political cases, abductions, and forced press conferences were being used to dismantle his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party. “All prove that the rule of law has been entirely dismantled. What we now have is the law of the jungle,” he added.Reiterating his stance from earlier this week, Khan stated that May 9, 2023, the day of violent protests after his arrest, was a “false flag operation” designed to crush PTI.“No CCTV footage has been presented to this day... The truth will be evident to all if the CCTV footage of that day is made public,” he added, as reported by news agency PTI.In a separate post, Khan also dismissed media reports suggesting that a deal was in the works with the military. “No one has approached me for any negotiations. News claiming otherwise is entirely false,” he said, adding that despite harsh jail conditions, including denial of access to his children and physician, he remains steadfast.He recently took a swipe at Army chief General Asim Munir’s promotion to Field Marshal, saying “it might have been more fitting to give him the title of ‘King’ instead, because right now, the country is ruled by the law of the jungle. And in the jungle, there is only one king,” as per PTI.Meanwhile, the Punjab government said Khan has refused to undergo polygraph and voice analysis tests in 12 terrorism cases linked to the May 9 riots for the third consecutive time.Pakistani Punjab’s information minister Azma Bokhari accused Khan of defying court orders, saying he made repeated excuses to avoid the tests. “He must understand this is Adiala Jail, not his Bani Gala residence,” she said.The trial in the GHQ attack case, which was last heard in February, has been adjourned again until May 29. Separately, the hearing in the Toshakhana-II case was postponed to May 26.Khan’s party has also urged the Islamabad High Court to speed up hearings in the Al-Qadir Trust case involving Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi. Protests continue outside the court, with party members demanding Khan’s release and denouncing what they call “unjust incarceration.”",Former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan has ruled out any negotiations with Pakistan's civilian government.

COLOMBO: A Sri Lankan court sentenced on Thursday two former ministers from the government of deposed president Gotabaya Rajapaksa to decades in prison in a landmark corruption case.Ex-sports minister Mahindananda Aluthgamage and former trade minister Anil Fernando were found guilty by the Colombo High Court of misappropriating 53 million rupees ($177,000) of state funds.The pair were also fined $2,000 for using government money to donate board games, including 14,000 carrom boards and 11,000 draughts sets, in an attempt to boost the failed 2015 re-election bid of Gotabaya's elder brother, Mahinda Rajapaksa.Aluthgamage was sentenced to 20 years in jail. Fernando was sentenced to 25 years.Aluthgamage is now the most senior member of a Rajapaksa-led cabinet to be successfully prosecuted for corruption.The cases against both men were initiated six years ago, when the Rajapaksa brothers were out of power, but the case had been making slow headway until a new government took office last year.Aluthgamage also faces a separate investigation into allegations that he authorised in 2022 a payment of $6.09 million to a Chinese supplier for a fertilizer shipment that was never delivered.He caused a stir in 2020 when he accused Sri Lanka's national cricket team of rigging the 2011 World Cup final in favour of India, triggering an investigation that ultimately failed to substantiate his claims.Aluthgamage, who served as sports minister from 2010 to 2015, said in June 2020 that he had ""not wanted to disclose"" the alleged match-fixing plot at the time.""In 2011, we were supposed to win, but we sold the match. I feel I can talk about it now. I am not implicating players, but certain sections were involved,"" he said.Sri Lanka lost the final at Mumbai's Wankhede stadium by six wickets.

The climbers hire thousands of people in Nepal to assist their climbs by carrying gear, cooking food and generally taking care of them as they spend weeks in the mountains.Nepal's government collects money from the climbers through permit fees.The end of May also marks the end of the popular spring mountaineering season, when climbers finish their adventures and retreat from the peaks before the monsoon season brings foul weather.""This day is celebrated also to mark the end of the climbing season where we gather climbers and the community,"" Jiban Ghimire of Shangri-La Nepal Trek said.According to Nepal's Department of Mountaineering, 468 foreign climbers from 57 countries received permits to climb Everest by the end of May, along with a roughly equal number of Nepalese mountain guides.Many were able to scale the peak, but officials were still working to verify how many reached the 8,849-metre (29,032-foot) summit. Climbers must report to the department with proof they reached the summit and cleared their garbage before they are issued the official certificate.Famed Sherpa guide Kami Rita reached the Everest summit for the 31st time Tuesday, breaking his own record for the most climbs to the top of the famed mountain.","Nepal's mountaineering community celebrated the conquest of the world's highest mountain with a rally.

Kathmandu is bracing for two opposition rallies on Thursday, one led by the ruling CPN-UML and the other by the royalists as the nation marks Republic Day.The Communist Party of Nepal- Unified Marxist Leninist (CPN-UML) have called for a cultural parade from Bhrikutimandap to Ratnapark in celebration of Republic Day.The rally is expected to be attended by party leaders, cadres, and artists showcasing cultural processions promoting the republican system. The rally has been routed through the venue where the royalists will be starting their indefinite protest starting today, calling for the restoration of the monarchy.The royalist and Hindu nationalist parties, including Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP) and RPP-Nepal, along with over 45 other aligned organisations, have announced protests against the republic.The main protest is being organised by the Joint People's Movement Committee for the Restoration of Monarchy, led by Navaraj Subedi. The committee has said that the protest will start from Shanti Batika near the iconic ""RPokhari"" translated as Queen's Pond.Although both sides have pledged peaceful rallies, tensions have risen following a controversial statement by Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli , who claimed that Kathmandu would be ""under UML's control"" on Republic Day, prompting backlash from royalist leaders.The royalist leaders had announced that the protest would be peaceful, but raised concerns over potential state suppression in light of the prime minister's remarks.To manage potential unrest, authorities have prepared to deploy 4,500 security personnel throughout Kathmandu. Traffic disruptions and public inconvenience are expected in the core areas of the city.In the wake of the possible conflict between the parties, the District Security Committee of Kathmandu has scheduled the programs at different times.Kathmandu Chief District Officer (CDO) Rishiram Tiwari coordinated with Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP) Chairman Rajendra Lingden, who agreed to start the royalist event only after UML's program ends. Kathmandu police chief SSP Bishwa Adhikari stated that a security plan has been prepared in coordination with both parties.Lingden confirmed to the CDO that the pro-monarchy program will commence in the afternoon and that preparations are being made accordingly.

Bangladesh: Khaleda Zia’s backers demand new election,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-khaleda-zias-backers-demand-new-election/articleshow/121466863.cms,"AP image





Tens of thousands of students and youths from a leading Bangladeshi political party rallied in the capital, Dhaka, on Wednesday, calling for a general election in December as discontent grows with the interim government appointed after the ouster of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in August.Activists from three groups linked to the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, or BNP, headed by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia gathered on the streets outside its party headquarters, under heightened security.Wednesday's rally was held after weeks of political tensions after interim leader and Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus threatened to quit and the influential military chief publicly declared his support for an election in December.Zia, who has been suffering from ill-health for several years, recently returned to Bangladesh after four months of medical treatment in London, putting further pressure on Bangladesh's interim government to call an election.""We have come here to respond to the call for the unity of the young people. We want democracy, we want election. Next election should be held soon, not later than December,"" Jahangir Hossain, a student activist, told The Associated Press.""We are united for democracy.""Hasina, Zia's archrival, has been in exile in India since she was toppled last year by a mass uprising. Her party, the Awami League, was also banned by the interim government.The BNP's acting chairman, Tarique Rahman, Zia's elder son, addressed the rally later on Wednesday by video link from London, where he is in exile.Detailing his party's future plans for youth and others, Rahman reiterated his call for the next elections to be held in December and asked his supporters to prepare.""The polls must be held by December. It has to take place within December,"" he said.The interim government has been shaken by a series of protests, including by civil servants, primary school teachers and employees at the national revenue service in recent weeks. Many, including New York-based Human Rights Watch, accuse the government of failures in prosecuting organized crime figures responsible for killing and injuring hundreds of people. The rights group in a statement this month blamed the interim administration for legislative initiatives that undermine fundamental freedoms,Business bodies have also criticized Yunus over the weakness of the economy and labor unrest.When Yunus came to power, he promised to make reforms in areas including the election law, women's rights and general administration, but the process has been slow and his critics believe he is using delaying tactics to remain in power.The 10 months of rule under Yunus also marked a visible rise of influence by Islamists in the Muslim-majority country, which is governed largely by a secular constitution and legal system. A fatigued military, which has been out of barracks since July last year to maintain law and order, is unhappy because of the delay in returning to democracy.The BNP recently met with Yunus and reiterated its demand for an election in December, saying that if Yunus quits, the country will find an alternative leader. But Yunus' associates later said he was staying.Yunus promised to hold an election by June 2026, depending on the extent of reforms it has undertaken. The BNP, which is hopeful of forming the next government with the absence of Hasina's Awami League, said the pace of implementation of reforms should not be an excuse to delay the election and argued that the reform is a continuous process.","Bangladesh's interim government has been shaken by a series of protests in recent weeks.

Meghan Markle 'invisible' to Montecito community? Neighbours complain the couple hasn't tried to 'fit in',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/meghan-markle-invisible-to-montecito-community-neighbours-complain-the-couple-hasnt-tried-to-fit-in/articleshow/121494784.cms,"Meghan Markle Breaks Silence On Money Struggles - Billionaire Ally Steps In With Shocking Revelation





Since stepping away from royal life in 2020, Meghan Markle and Prince Harry have settled California their home — but their neighbours say the couple have shown little interest in becoming part of the local community.Richard Mineards, a local journalist, told the Daily Mail that while the Duke of Sussex is known to be warm and approachable, his wife has kept a much lower profile.Mineards recalled an incident where Markle reportedly turned away an elderly local historian who wished to present her with a copy of his documentary about the area. “The old man never got past the gate,” he said, adding that Markle “doesn’t play the community game.”The journalist contrasted Markle’s distant approach with that of fellow Montecito resident Oprah Winfrey, who is well-known for her visible presence at charity events.Meghan has remained practically invisible to her neighbours ever since the couple purchased their $14 million home, which has now doubled in value, Mineards said.“She’s there, of course, but she shows herself very little. Her relationship with Montecito is … distant, shall we say,” he said, adding that the former actress has managed to “cultivate a very controlled image” of herself.“She pays attention to every appearance, every word, every gesture,” the New York Post quoted.Meanwhile, Mineards described Prince Harry, 40, as “always charming, approachable, with that very recognizable Windsor accent.”The prince “has kept his good natured side,” he said.“He smiles, shakes hands, and willingly exchanges a few words.”The reporter also noted that many locals have seen Harry out and about, whether at the beach, visiting an organic coffee shop, or cycling in the nearby hills with his security following in a Range Rover.","Meghan Markle has kept a low profile since moving to Montecito, California, with Prince Harry.

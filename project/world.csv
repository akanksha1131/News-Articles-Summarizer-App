Recent designated survivors



Here are the designated survivors from recent years:



2024: Education Secretary Miguel Cardona

2023: Labor Secretary Marty Walsh

2022: Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo

2021: No designated survivor due to limited attendance amid COVID-19

2020: Interior Secretary David Bernhardt

2019: Energy Secretary Rick Perry

Secretary of Veterans Affairs Doug Collins has been selected as the designated survivor for President Donald Trump's 2025 joint address to Congress , White House sources confirmed shortly before the speech on Tuesday night.The tradition of appointing a designated survivor ensures continuity of government in the event of a catastrophic incident during the address, which is attended by the president, vice president, and the full line of succession. Collins, a former representative from Georgia, was confirmed as VA Secretary on February 4 and is 17th in the presidential line of succession .A designated survivor is a cabinet member chosen to remain at a secure, undisclosed location during the address. This precaution ensures that a government leader remains available to take charge if an emergency incapacitates those in attendance.While the US Constitution establishes the line of succession, the modern order was set by the Presidential Succession Act of 1947. Vice President JD Vance is first in line, followed by House Speaker Mike Johnson, Senate President Pro Tempore Chuck Grassley, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. The list continues through other cabinet members, with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem being 18th.Since nearly all these officials attend the joint session, a designated survivor is selected to stay away.The practice of appointing a designated survivor is believed to have started during the Cold War in the 1950s, though it was first officially recorded in 1981 when Education Secretary Terrel Bell was given the role.The selection process remains classified, but the individual must meet presidential eligibility criteria: being a natural-born US citizen and at least 35 years old. Some past cabinet members, such as former Secretaries of State Madeleine Albright and Henry Kissinger, were ineligible due to being born outside the USFormer Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala, designated in 1996 under President Bill Clinton, recalled her experience, saying, “I was shown the Situation Room and the White House staff talked seriously about the responsibility of the designated survivor.”Past designated survivors have shared their experiences, revealing they are accompanied by security personnel, including a military officer carrying the ""nuclear football.""Former Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, who was chosen in 2000, described his experience, saying, “It’s fun. You’re sitting there, you’re being watched. You got security. And there are a few thrills.”Former Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, who was designated in the 1990s, recalled in a 2017 Politico essay that he was taken to a secure location outside Washington. He wrote, “I don’t recall getting any specific instructions on what to do if the doomsday scenario happened… All I knew is that if necessary, I could turn to that military officer accompanying me, holding that 45-pound bag, and trigger a military response, including a nuclear strike.”Shalala, who remained in Washington during her time as designated survivor, recalled waiting at the White House and ordering pizza for her staff. “I saw the president when he left and when he came back,” she said. “He said, ‘Don’t do anything I wouldn’t do.’”Typically, cabinet members from various departments have been selected for the role, though Secretaries of State, Defense, and Treasury have never been chosen.With Collins now assuming the role for 2025, the longstanding tradition continues as the Trump administration ensures the government's continuity during this high-profile address.","Doug Collins has been selected as the designated survivor for President Donald Trump's 2025 joint address to Congress.

What is Ash Wednesday? Understanding the first day of Lent and the 40-day period of prayer,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-is-ash-wednesday-understanding-the-first-day-of-lent-and-the-40-day-period-of-prayer/articleshow/118721562.cms,"Vatican makes new plans for Ash Wednesday (AP Photo)

Significance and traditions





On Ash Wednesday, many Christians, particularly Catholics, receive a cross of ashes on their foreheads, symbolizing penance and humility.

The ashes, traditionally made from burned palm branches from the previous year's Palm Sunday, are applied with the words: “Remember that you are dust, and to dust you shall return.”

It is a day of fasting and abstinence, with many believers limiting meals and refraining from eating meat.

The Start of Lent





Prayer (deepening their relationship with God),

Fasting (giving up certain foods or habits), and

Almsgiving (acts of charity and service).

Ash Wednesday marks the beginning of Lent , a 40-day period of prayer, fasting, and reflection observed by many Christians worldwide. It falls 46 days before Easter Sunday (40 fasting days, excluding Sundays) and serves as a solemn reminder of human mortality and the need for repentance.This year's Ash Wednesday occurs as Pope Francis remains hospitalised at Rome's Gemelli Hospital after he was admitted to the hospital on February 14 for a respiratory illness. On Monday, the Vatican reported that Francis had suffered two attacks of ""acute respiratory insufficiency,"" and doctors performed two procedures on the pope to clear his air passages.Lent, which spans 40 days (excluding Sundays), commemorates Jesus’ 40 days of fasting and temptation in the wilderness. During this time, Christians engage in spiritual disciplines such as:Ash Wednesday is not a public holiday, but it is widely observed by Christian communities, particularly in Catholic, Anglican, Lutheran, and Methodist traditions.","Ash Wednesday marks the beginning of Lent, a 40-day period of prayer, fasting, and reflection observed by many Christians worldwide.

'English in taste'

'Language of learning'

""Dram"", meaning a measure of whisky. ""Turm"", describing a cavalry unit. ""Taupie"", a foolish youngster.Not words in a typical teen's vocabulary, but all come easily to Pakistani prodigy Bilal Asher , world under-14 Scrabble champion.Despite a musty reputation, the word-spelling game has a cult youth following in Pakistan, a legacy of the English languageimposed by Britain's empire but which the country has adapted into its own dialect since independence.In the eccentric field of competitive Scrabble, Pakistan's youngsters reign supreme -- boasting the current youth world champion and more past victors than any other nation since the tournament debuted in 2006.""It requires a lot of hard work and determination,"" said 13-year-old Asher after vanquishing a grey-bearded opponent.""You have to trust the process for a very long time, and then gradually it will show the results.""Karachi, a megacity shrugging off its old definition as a den of violent crime, is Pakistan's incubator for talent in Scrabble -- where players spell words linked like a crossword with random lettered tiles.Schools in the southern port metropolis organise tutorials with professional Scrabble coaches and grant scholarships to top players, while parents push their kids to become virtuosos.""They inculcate you in this game,"" said Asher, one of around 100 players thronging a hotel function room for a Pakistan Scrabble Association (PSA) event as most of the city dozed through a Sunday morning.Daunters (meaning intimidating people), imarets (inns for pilgrims) and trienes (chemical compounds containing three double bonds) are spelled out by ranks of seated opponents.Some are so young their feet don't touch the ground, as they use chess clocks to time their turns.""They're so interested because the parents are interested,"" said 16-year-old Affan Salman, who became the world youth Scrabble champion in Sri Lanka last year.""They want their children to do productive things -- Scrabble is a productive game.""English was foisted onthe Indian subcontinent by Britain's colonialism and an 1835 order from London started to systematise it as the main language of education.The plan's architect, Thomas Macaulay, said the aim was to produce ""a class of persons, Indian in blood and colour, but English in taste, in opinions, in morals and in intellect.""It was instrumental in creating a colonial civil service to rule for Britain according to Kaleem Raza Khan, who teaches English at Karachi's Salim Habib University.""They started teaching English because they wanted to create a class of people, Indian people, who would be in the middle of the people and the rulers,"" said Khan, whose wife and daughter are Scrabble devotees.British rule ended in the bloody partition of 1947 creating India and Pakistan.Today there are upwards of 70 languages spoken in Pakistan, but English remains an official state language alongside the lingua franca Urdu, and they mingle in daily usage.Schools often still teach English with verbose colonial-era textbooks.""The adaptation of English as the main language is definitely a relation to the colonial era,"" said PSA youth programme director Tariq Pervez. ""That is our main link.""The English of Pakistani officialdom remains steeped in anachronistic words.The prime minister describes militant attacks as ""dastardly"", state media dubs protesters ""miscreants"" and the military denounces its ""nefarious"" adversaries.Becoming fluent in the loquacious lingo of Pakistani English remains aspirational because of its association to the upper echelons of society.In Pakistan more than a third of children between the ages of five and 16 are out of school -- a total of nearly 26 million, according to the 2023 census.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif declared an ""education emergency"" last year to address the stark figures.""People are interested in Scrabble because they can get opportunities for scholarships in universities or for jobs because it provides the vocab,"" said Asher's sister Manaal.But the 14-year-old reigning female number one in Pakistan warned: ""You've got to be resilient otherwise Scrabble isn't right for you.""In the Karachi hotel, Scrabble -- invented in the 1930s during America's Great Depression by an unemployed architect -- is an informal training programme for success in later life.""The main language of learning is English,"" said Pervez.""This game has a great pull,"" he added. ""The demand is so big. So many kids want to play, we don't have enough resources to accommodate all of them.""At the youngest level the vocabulary of the players is more rudimentary: toy, tiger, jar, oink.But professional Scrabble coach Waseem Khatri earns 250,000 rupees ($880) a month -- nearly seven times the minimum wage -- coaching some 6,000 students across Karachi's school system to up their game.In Pakistani English parlance ""they try to express things in a more beautiful way -- in a long way to express their feelings,"" said 36-year-old Khatri.""We try to utilise those words also in Scrabble.""But when Asher wins he is overwhelmed with joy, and those long words don't come so easily.""I cannot describe the feeling,"" he said.",Pakistani youngsters reign supreme in the eccentric field of competitive Scrabble. The word-spelling game has a cult youth following in Pakistan. English was foisted on the Indian subcontinent by Britain's colonialism.

Israeli army tightens social media rules after probe finds Hamas used posts for Oct 7 attack,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/israeli-army-tightens-social-media-rules-bans-base-photography-after-probe-finds-hamas-used-soldiers-posts-for-oct-7-attack/articleshow/118720849.cms,"The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) is imposing stricter restrictions on soldiers’ social media activity after an internal investigation revealed that Hamas used online posts to gather intelligence on the Nahal Oz base before its deadly October 7 attack.During the assault, 53 soldiers were killed, and 10 others were taken captive. The probe found that photos shared by soldiers on their first and last days at the base enabled Hamas to map out key locations, including surveillance cameras, generators, safe rooms, and patrol movements. Captured Palestinian fighters later admitted they had built training models of Nahal Oz using this information.To prevent similar intelligence leaks, the IDF is now banning photography inside military facilities, enforcing strict penalties for violations, and extending security classifications to a broader range of roles. Soldiers and officers will also be prohibited from using social media platforms like Facebook while serving in sensitive positions. Additionally, public filming of civilian-attended military ceremonies and events will be restricted.The investigation also found that Nahal Oz soldiers received no warning before the attack. Security protocols did not account for rocket fire or the protection of unarmed personnel, and ground assault drills had not been conducted for years.Further army probes revealed that Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad deployed around 5,000 fighters in coordinated attacks on Israeli communities and military positions along the Gaza border. Intelligence about the looming assault was misinterpreted, and the army was more focused on threats from Iran and Hezbollah. The reports, made public on Thursday, addressed operational failures but did not examine political decisions.Growing calls for an independent inquiry into the October 7 failures have intensified. Such a commission, typically led by a senior Supreme Court justice, would have broader authority to summon witnesses and collect evidence. However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has opposed the move, saying on Monday he would not support a ""politically biased"" investigation. His remarks sparked clashes between bereaved families and Knesset security personnel.On October 7, Hamas attacks near the Gaza border resulted in at least 1,180 deaths and the abduction of 252 Israelis and foreign nationals.

Trump’s endgame? Trudeau alleges annexation motive

Markets rattle as trade tensions escalate

No resolution in sight

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau declared on Tuesday that Canada will not back down in its escalating trade war with the United States, calling US President Donald Trump ’s tariffs a “very dumb thing to do.” In response, Trudeau announced 25% retaliatory tariffs on $30 billion worth of US imports.“The United States launched a trade war against Canada… Canadians are reasonable. We are polite. We will not back down from a fight,” Trudeau said, emphasizing that while he considers Trump a “smart guy,” his trade policies are reckless.Trudeau went further, claiming Trump’s ultimate goal is to see Canada’s economy “collapse” to make annexation “easier.” The explosive remark comes as Washington implements sweeping tariffs—25% on Canadian and Mexican imports and 10% on Canadian energy exports.Trump, who has previously floated the idea of making Canada the 51st US state, has defended the tariffs as necessary to protect American jobs. However, Trudeau’s comments mark the strongest Canadian pushback yet, suggesting a deeper geopolitical motive behind the economic conflict.Global markets reacted negatively, with the Dow dropping over 500 points following the announcement. Economic analysts warn the tariffs could trigger inflation and disrupt North American supply chains. Canada’s countermeasures, set to take effect in three weeks, will target key US sectors, including agriculture and steel.Meanwhile, Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum vowed to impose retaliatory tariffs, adding another layer to the growing North American trade dispute. Experts say Trump’s moves could push US trade policy back to its most protectionist stance since World War II.Despite diplomatic efforts, neither side appears willing to de-escalate. “Our tariffs will remain in place until US trade action is withdrawn,” Trudeau said.With both countries digging in, the trade war shows no signs of easing—raising fears of long-term economic consequences for businesses and consumers on both sides of the border.","Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau declared on Tuesday that Canada will not back down in its escalating trade war with the United States.

A ‘rising star’ takes the stage

What to expect from Slotkin’s response

The stakes are high

Senator Elissa Slotkin , a former CIA analyst and rising Democratic star, will deliver her party’s response to President Donald Trump ’s address to Congress on Tuesday. Slotkin, who won Michigan’s Senate seat last year in a fiercely contested race, is set to present the Democratic vision in a speech that aims to counter Trump’s expected rhetoric.Slotkin, 48, made history as the youngest Democratic woman elected to the Senate and now represents a key swing state that former Vice-President Kamala Harris lost in the 2024 election. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called her ""great on both economic and national security issues,"" touting her as the ideal choice to take on Trump in primetime.""From our economic security to our national security, we've got to chart a way forward that actually improves people's lives in the country we all love,"" Slotkin said in a statement ahead of her speech.Slotkin’s rebuttal is expected to hammer home the Democrats’ key message: protecting working-class Americans while Republicans ""cut taxes for their billionaire donors and Elon Musk ,"" as House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries put it. She will focus on lowering the cost of living, defending Social Security and Medicaid , and presenting a stark contrast to Trump’s economic policies.Her selection signals the Democratic Party’s intent to showcase moderate voices with strong national security credentials. Before entering politics, Slotkin served as a CIA analyst and held key roles in both the Bush and Obama administrations. She was deployed to Iraq three times before moving to the National Security Council and the Pentagon.Slotkin’s speech comes at a pivotal moment, with Trump’s return to Washington reigniting fierce political battles. As one of the Senate’s newest faces, she will need to balance Democratic priorities while appealing to the swing voters who helped her secure Michigan.With her intelligence background and centrist credentials, Slotkin may prove to be one of the Democrats’ strongest voices against Trump—both on Tuesday night and in the battles ahead.","Elissa Slotkin, 48, is a rising Democratic star who won Michigan's Senate seat last year.

What is a designated survivor?

Who is Doug Collins?



What happens during the speech?



Secretary of Veterans Affairs Doug Collins has been named the designated survivor for President Donald Trump’s 2025 joint address to Congress, ensuring continuity of government in case of a catastrophic event during the high-profile gathering.The White House confirmed Collins’ selection shortly before the speech on Tuesday night. As designated survivor, he was taken to a secure, undisclosed location while Trump, Vice President JD Vance, and top government officials convened in the Capitol. Collins, who was confirmed as VA Secretary on February 4, 2025, is 17th in the presidential line of succession .A designated survivor is a cabinet member chosen to remain away from the event to ensure the continuity of government in case of an attack or disaster that incapacitates the leadership. The practice, which dates back to the Cold War era, was first officially recorded in 1981 when Education Secretary Terrel Bell was selected.The designated survivor must meet presidential eligibility criteria, including being a natural-born US citizen and at least 35 years old. Some cabinet members in the past, such as former Secretaries of State Madeleine Albright and Henry Kissinger, were ineligible due to being born outside the US.Former Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala, who served as the designated survivor in 1996, recalled, “I was shown the Situation Room and the White House staff talked seriously about the responsibility of the designated survivor.”Collins, a former congressman from Georgia’s 9th congressional district, served from 2013 to 2021 before being appointed Secretary of Veterans Affairs. He has a background in law, having worked as a managing partner at the Collins and Csider law firm since 2010. His military experience includes serving as a Navy chaplain in the late 1980s before joining the US Air Force Reserve Command, where he holds the rank of Colonel.As VA Secretary, Collins oversees nearly 200 medical centers and manages a budget of approximately $350 billion, aiming to improve care quality and address veterans’ health challenges.Designated survivors are accompanied by security personnel, including a military officer carrying the “nuclear football.” Former Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, who was the designated survivor in 2000, described the experience, saying, “It’s fun. You’re sitting there, you’re being watched. You got security.

Why Donald Trump wore a purple tie during his address to US congress?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/why-donald-trump-wore-a-purple-tie-during-his-address-to-us-congress/articleshow/118721886.cms,"LIVE: Donald Trump delivers speech to Congress

Donald Trump’s during his first joint address of the Congress sported a dark purple patterned tie and not his usual bold red tie. In politics, purple is often seen as a blend of Republican red and Democratic blue, symbolising bipartisanship and unity, as reported by the Wall Street Journal.The speech itself began with a characteristic show of confidence. “America is back,” Trump declared. He framed his presidency as an era of swift and decisive action, portraying his policies as the key to restoring American strength.Melania Trump watched from the gallery, joined by other congressmen. Trump's key ally Elon Musk was also present, wearing a blue tie.The guests also included the widow of a fallen NYPD officer, a victim of explicit deepfake images, and a teacher recently freed from detention in Russia. Democrats, in contrast, invited federal workers affected by Trump’s budget cuts and government watchdogs dismissed under his administration.The address also saw protests across the country, with demonstrators gathering in all 50 states to oppose Trump’s policies. While their grievances ranged from economic concerns to his handling of foreign affairs, the widespread opposition underscored the deeply polarising nature of his presidency.The address comes at a pivotal moment, with Trump navigating economic turmoil, foreign policy tensions, and a deeply divided Congress. Inflation remains a major concern for voters, with consumer confidence sinking and market gains since his re-election now erased. His response has been to double down on aggressive trade policies, including new tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China. These measures have sparked fears of a trade war, adding further uncertainty to an already volatile economy.Despite the controversies, Trump’s grip on the Republican Party remains firm. His speech was met with enthusiasm from GOP lawmakers, with House Speaker Mike Johnson declaring, “We will not be ripping up the speech tonight. I would like to frame it in gilded gold.”Foreign policy was another major focus. Trump recently froze military aid to Ukraine, pressuring President Volodymyr Zelenskyy into negotiations with Russia. This move has drawn sharp criticism, with many Democrats and some Republicans condemning what they see as an abandonment of a key ally. Lawmakers showed their opposition by wearing blue and yellow in solidarity with Ukraine.","Donald Trump sported a dark purple patterned tie during his speech.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Tuesday accused US President Donald Trump of deliberately imposing tariffs to weaken Canada’s economy, claiming it was part of an effort to make annexation easier.His remarks came as the United States enforced a 25 percent tariff on all Canadian goods, escalating tensions between the two nations. Canada swiftly retaliated, sparking a trade war that threatens billions of dollars in daily cross-border commerce.Trump justified the tariffs by citing concerns over undocumented migration and fentanyl trafficking from Canada into the US. However, Trudeau dismissed this rationale, calling it ""completely false"" and maintaining that Canada is not a significant contributor to these issues.When asked about Trump's motivations, Trudeau said, ""He wants to see a collapse of the Canadian economy because that would make it easier to annex us."" He also pointed out that Trump has repeatedly spoken about making Canada the 51st state of the US.""The United States launched a trade war against Canada,"" Trudeau stated, adding, ""Canadians are reasonable. We are polite. We will not back down from a fight.""Trudeau further criticised the tariffs as a misguided move, telling Trump directly that while he considers him a ""smart guy,"" the decision to impose tariffs was ""a very dumb thing to do.""As Trudeau prepares to step down as prime minister following the Liberal Party’s leadership transition on Sunday, he remains focused on securing the removal of US tariffs. His government has implemented measures, including a costly border security initiative and appointing a fentanyl czar, to address American concerns in hopes of resolving the crisis.Despite rising tensions, Trudeau reiterated his willingness to engage with Trump, stressing the need to lift the tariffs ""as quickly as possible.""","Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accused US President Donald Trump of deliberately imposing tariffs to weaken Canada’s economy.

President Donald Trump will deliver his first address to Congress since returning to office on Tuesday, vowing a “renewal of the American dream” while outlining his administration’s agenda of expanded presidential authority and a reshaped global order.The speech, scheduled for 9:00 pm (0200 GMT Wednesday), follows six turbulent weeks in which Trump has implemented sweeping changes, including a radical restructuring of the federal government led by billionaire advisor Elon Musk. The administration’s moves have included shutting down agencies and dismissing numerous government employees.Trump’s global policy shifts have also sparked controversy, with the president pausing military aid to Ukraine while engaging Russia, declaring his intent to “own” Gaza, and imposing tariffs on US allies.The White House confirmed the address would center on “the renewal of the American dream,” sharing links to Fox News, which reported that Trump would discuss domestic and foreign policy achievements, economic plans, border security funding , and his vision for global peace.“President Trump is the greatest orator we’ve ever had in the Oval Office.

(AP)

KYIV: President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine on Tuesday offered a course of action that he said could end the war, while trying to assure the Trump administration that his government was dedicated to peace.""Our meeting in Washington, at the White House on Friday, did not go the way it was supposed to be,"" Zelenskyy wrote on the social platform X. ""It is regrettable that it happened this way. It is time to make things right.""He was referring to an explosive meeting at the White House last week in which President Donald Trump berated Zelenskyy and called him ungrateful. Trump followed up Monday by announcing that he was pausing all US military aid to Ukraine.The Ukrainian leader said he was ready to release Russian prisoners of war, stop long-range drone and missile strikes aimed at Russian targets, and declare a truce at sea immediately -- moves that he said would help establish a pathway to peace.Only, however, ""if Russia will do the same,"" he added.Zelenskyy's proposal seemed clearly designed to shift the burden for ending the war onto Russia, which launched its invasion three years ago. The White House has claimed that the Ukrainian leader is the main obstacle to peace.In his post, Zelenskyy offered effusive praise for US support, noting specifically ""the moment when things changed when President Trump provided Ukraine with Javelins.""""We are grateful for this,"" he wrote. ""Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer,"" he added. ""My team and I stand ready to work under President Trump's strong leadership to get a peace that lasts.""There was no immediate reaction from the Kremlin to Zelenskyy's proposal.In recent weeks, however, President Vladimir Putin of Russia has offered no hint of being willing to de-escalate the war before winning major concessions from the West and Ukraine -- like ruling out Ukrainian Nato membership, reducing the alliance's footprint in Europe, limiting the size of Ukraine's military, and giving Russia influence over Ukraine's domestic politics.","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy offered a course of action that he said could end the war.

'We're going to win this war': Canadian Premier Doug Ford warns of power cuts to US over tariffs battle,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/were-going-to-win-this-war-canadian-premier-doug-ford-warns-of-power-cuts-to-us-over-tariffs-battle/articleshow/118718881.cms,"Ontario Premier Doug Ford on CNN: ‘It’s not you, it’s your president that’s causing this problem’

Canada's most populous province has threatened possible retaliation against the US, vowing to back the country's unified response to President Donald Trump’s 25% tariffs on imports— even if it involves cutting off electricity supplies to America.Speaking at a mining convention in Toronto on Monday, Ontario Premier Doug Ford issued a stark warning, stating: “If they want to try to annihilate Ontario, I will do everything, including cut off their energy, with a smile on my face.”“They rely on our energy, they need to feel the pain. They want to come at us hard, we’re going to come back twice as hard,” Ford added, the Toronto Sun reported.During a subsequent CNN interview, Ford expressed regret to Americans whilst outlining his contingency strategy, which included the possibility of suspending electrical supply from Ontario that currently serves 1.5 million homes across New York, Michigan and Minnesota.“This situation is unnecessary, but we have no choice but to respond. I sincerely apologize to the American people—this isn’t about you. It’s your president who is creating this problem,” Ford continued.“This is unnecessary, and we do have to retaliate, and I apologise to the American people. It’s not you, it’s your president that’s causing this problem,” he added.The Canadian official issued power cut warnings shortly before Trump's tariff measures took effect. There was uncertainty whether the premier referred to nationwide energy export cuts to the US or specifically from his province.Ford reiterated his previous commitment to reciprocate Trump's 25% taxation on all Canadian, Mexican and Chinese imports to the United States with equivalent measures. “I [didn’t] start this tariff war, but we’re going to win this tariff war,” Ford said.“The provinces have a big say in it, but it’s the federal government that’s leading the charge, and we’re going to stand shoulder to shoulder no matter who’s in the federal government,” he further added.When questioned about Ford's statements, Governor Kathy Hochul expressed her confidence that he would not implement these measures, citing their cordial relationship.“I’d be happy to have additional conversations with him on how we can support each other during this crisis, so I feel positive that anything within his power that he can control – that we do not have a target on our backs,” the New York governor said, the New York Post reported.In response, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promptly announced 25% tariffs on C$30 billion (US$20.7 billion) of US imports, including orange juice, peanut butter, wine, spirits, beer, coffee, appliances, apparel, footwear, motorcycles, cosmetics, and pulp and paper.Trudeau further warned that if Trump’s tariffs remained in effect after 21 days, Canada would respond by imposing additional tariffs on C$125 billion worth of imports.","Ontario Premier Doug Ford issued a stark warning, stating: ‘If they want to try to annihilate Ontario, I will do everything, including cut off their energy, with a smile on my face’ Ford reiterated his previous commitment to reciprocate Trump's 25% taxation on all Canadian, Mexican and Chinese imports to the United States.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118719688,imgsize-780003,width-400,resizemode-4/118719688.jpg"
'So sleazy': Capitol Hill buzzes over Republican Sen. Joni Ernst’s alleged military affairs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/so-sleazy-capitol-hill-buzzes-over-republican-sen-joni-ernsts-alleged-military-affairs/articleshow/118718331.cms,"Republican Sen. Joni Ernst

Republican Sen. Joni Ernst , a key figure in military oversight , has been thrust into controversy after reports surfaced alleging her involvement with not one but two military officials—one of whom was a disgraced Air Force general demoted for inappropriate relationships on Capitol Hill.According to a bombshell ProPublica investigation , Ernst was named as one of the alleged partners of retired Maj. Gen. Christopher Finerty, who was demoted after a military probe uncovered his illicit affairs with multiple women. Finerty, once a rising star in the Air Force’s legislative affairs office, was forced into early retirement in November 2023 after investigators found he had engaged in “sexual, inappropriate, or unprofessional relationships.”While the inspector general’s report redacted the names of Finerty’s partners, two sources confirmed to ProPublica that Ernst was among them. According to the Daily Beast, the revelations have raised serious ethical concerns, as Finerty, described as a de facto lobbyist for the Air Force, may have influenced legislative decisions while engaged in the alleged affair.One Air Force source characterized the situation as “so sleazy” that it tainted the branch’s interactions with Congress. Ernst, a combat veteran and a key member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, wields significant influence over Pentagon funding—further intensifying the scandal ’s implications.Adding to the intrigue, three sources told ProPublica that Finerty was not Ernst’s only romantic entanglement with a military official. In 2019, the same year she finalized her divorce, she allegedly had a relationship with a Navy legislative affairs officer. The affair reportedly created friction between her office and the Navy, further complicating Ernst’s standing on military matters.The senator’s office has refused to directly deny the allegations, instead dismissing them as “tabloid journalism.” A spokesperson issued a defiant statement: “The fake news media is clearly too busy gossiping to report the real news that Senator Ernst is focused on cutting waste at the Pentagon. Any insinuation otherwise is a slanderous lie—full stop.”Finerty’s attorney has also denied any wrongdoing, insisting that his client never leveraged personal relationships for undue influence. However, the military’s investigation found text exchanges between Finerty and at least one Capitol Hill woman in which personal and professional discussions appeared intertwined.One particularly damning exchange from 2021 allegedly involved Finerty sending a list of Air Force priorities—fighter jets, radar technology, and military interoperability improvements—to a romantic partner. The woman, whose identity was redacted, reportedly responded flirtatiously before sending explicit images, to which Finerty allegedly quipped, “This whole no more sexting didn’t last long huh?”The Air Force’s report acknowledged that while there was “no direct evidence of favors or sensitive information being exchanged,” the perception of unethical behavior created serious concerns.As the scandal unfolds, questions swirl about whether Ernst’s alleged relationships affected her legislative decisions. Given her role in shaping military policy, the controversy threatens to cast a long shadow over her political future. Whether ethics investigators or Senate colleagues will demand further scrutiny remains to be seen, but for now, Ernst finds herself at the center of one of Washington’s most salacious political firestorms in recent memory.","Republican Sen.

Canada responds with tariffs

Trudeau accuses Trump of economic sabotage

Fentanyl claims rejected as ‘false excuse’

Trump’s tariffs timeline

February 1: Trump signed an executive order imposing a 25% tariff on goods from Mexico and Canada, with an extra 10% tariff on Canadian energy products.

February 3: The US announced a one-month delay in implementing additional tariffs to allow further negotiations.

March 4: The full 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods are set to take effect.

With both nations escalating trade restrictions, tensions between the longtime allies have reached a breaking point, setting the stage for a prolonged economic standoff.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has strongly condemned US President Donald Trump ’s decision to impose tariffs on Canadian goods, calling it an unjustified trade war and vowing to fight back.Speaking at a press conference on Tuesday, Trudeau criticized the US move, saying, “Today, the US launched a trade war against Canada, their closest partner and ally.” In response, Canada imposed 30 billion Canadian dollars ($21 billion) in tariffs on US goods, with a promise to escalate the countermeasures to 125 billion Canadian dollars within three weeks.Trudeau warned that American businesses and consumers would feel the impact of these tariffs, addressing Trump directly: “This is a very dumb thing to do.”The Canadian leader went further, accusing Trump of deliberately trying to cripple Canada’s economy for political and strategic reasons. He suggested that the US president sees Canada’s economic downfall as a means to strengthen US leverage and even push for annexation.“Trump wants to see a complete collapse of the Canadian economy,” Trudeau claimed. “Because that will make it easier to annex us. That is never going to happen.”Trudeau also dismissed Trump’s justification for the tariffs—citing fentanyl smuggling from Canada—as “an unjustified and false excuse.”To address US concerns, Canada had taken proactive steps, including appointing a “fentanyl czar” and designating Mexican cartels as terrorist groups. However, these efforts did not prevent Trump from moving forward with the tariffs.","Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has strongly condemned US President Donald Trump ’s decision to impose tariffs on Canadian goods.

Talks start on Pakistan’s $7 billion IMF bailout review,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/talks-start-on-pakistans-7billion-imf-bailout-review/articleshow/118717323.cms,"IMF

ISLAMABAD: Formal talks between cash-strapped Pakistan and International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) for the first biannual review of a $7-billion bailout programme kicked off Tuesday in Islamabad.Pakistan and IMF had reached a three-year $7 billion aid package deal in July, with the new programme set to allow the country to “cement macroeconomic stability and create conditions for stronger, more inclusive and resilient growth”. As part of the deal, Islamabad had agreed to a number of unpopular measures, including increasing the amount of tax it collects from people and businesses.A nine-member team led by IMF mission chief Nathan Porter had landed in Pakistan on Monday to assess the country’s economic performance to determine the release of a $1.1-billion tranche. “They are here. We will have two rounds of talks, first technical and then policy level. I think we are well-positioned for the talks,” finance minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said.During their discussions with Pakistani authorities, the IMF delegation will assess the country’s compliance with quantitative performance criteria, structural benchmarks and indicative targets under the 37-month programme.A senior govt official involved in preparations for the IMF review said there were some technical slippages for certain deadlines. The most critical weakness observed so far had been the revenue shortfall against programme targets, the official added.The ongoing 37-month Extended Fund Facility (EFF) programme consists of six reviews over the life of the bailout, and the release of the next tranche of approximately $1bn will be contingent on the success of the performance review.Just before the mission’s visit, IMF reiterated last week that its programme aimed to raise Pakistan’s woefully low tax-to-GDP ratio by 3%, while improving the fairness and efficiency of the tax system by broadening the tax base and improving tax compliance.According to media reports, IMF has been demanding action against tax evasion in the real estate sector. “During the ongoing talks, the IMF pushed for action against those misdeclaring property values,” a local TV station reported, saying the government had assured the global lender it would activate the Real Estate Regulatory Authority.Pakistan has taken more than 20 loans from the IMF since 1958 and is currently its fifth-largest debtor. For decades, the country has relied on IMF loans to meet its needs and continued to struggle after years of financial mismanagement.In 2023, Pakistan was on the verge of defaulting on its debts and had barely enough in foreign currencies to pay for a month of imports.","Pakistan and IMF had reached a three-year $7 billion aid package deal in July.

ISLAMABAD: At least five people were killed and 20 injured in a suicide blast at a mosque of an Islamic religious school known as the “university of jihad” in Nowshera district of Pakistan’s northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province on Friday.Among the dead were Maulana Hamid-ul-Haq Haqqani , head of Dar-ul-Uloom Haqqania school, the seminary in Nowshera’s Akora Khattak town where key Afghan Taliban leaders have studied. Mullah Omer, the slain founder of the Taliban movement in Afghanistan, was also an alumni of this religious school.Graduates of the seminary include current Afghan Taliban leaders Amir Khan Muttaqi, Sirajuddin Haqqani, Abdul Latif Mansoor, Maulvi Ahmad Jan, Mullah Jalaludin Haqani, Maulvi Qalamudin, Arifullah Arif and Mullah Khairullah Khairkhwa.The explosion occurred in the main prayer hall as people gathered for weekly Friday prayers were leaving the mosque.KP police chief Zulfiqar Hameed confirmed that it was a suicide attack and that three policemen were also injured. “More than a dozen police officers were guarding the mosque when the attack occurred, and Haq’s seminary also had its own security,” he said.“It appears that Hamid Haqqani (seminary’s slain chief) was the target,” Hameed added.Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the attack, which came on the last Friday ahead of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.Yawar Zia, a police constable, who was injured in the attack, said he was on security duty at the seminary when the blast happened and splinters hit him. “After offering prayer, Hamid-ul-Haq, accompanied by his guards, was leaving the mosque when the powerful explosion occurred,” the wounded official said.Eyewitnesses described a chaotic scene, with blood and body parts scattered all over the place. They said the casualties could have been much higher had the bomber struck during the prayers.Haqqani, the son of slain prominent Pakistani cleric Sami-ul-Haq Haqqani, known as the “father of Taliban, was a vice-chancellor of the sprawling seminary, located 60 km from the provincial capital of Peshawar. Following his father’s assassination in 2018, he also became chairman of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Sami (JUI-S) political party. He had also previously served as a member of the National Assembly from 2002 to 2007.Haq was also among the few who called on the world and Pakistan to immediately recognise the Taliban govt and establish diplomatic relations with Afghanistan after the fall of Kabul in 2021.Last year, he led a delegation of religious scholars to Afghanistan for “religious diplomacy” meetings with Taliban leaders.His seminary had faced controversy in the past as its students were accused of involvement in the assassination of Pakistan’s former prime minister, Benazir Bhutto. The madrasa, however, denied any connection with the suspects.","At least five people were killed and 20 injured in a suicide blast at a mosque.

China has signed an agreement with Pakistan to send a Pakistani astronaut to its space station, Tiangong , marking the first time a foreign national will be aboard the facility.The deal was signed in a ceremony held in Islamabad on Friday, between the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA) and Pakistan’s Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (SUPARCO). Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was alos present during the ceremony.According to a statement by CMSA, both nations will collaborate on selecting and training Pakistani astronauts, with the chosen candidate expected to join Chinese taikonauts for a short-term mission in the coming years.""This signifies a major step in China’s international space cooperation ,"" reported Global Times, highlighting the growing partnership between Beijing and Islamabad in aerospace advancements.China’s space station, which has been operational for nearly four years, was built after the country was reportedly excluded from the International Space Station (ISS) due to concerns over the involvement of China’s military in its space programme.The station is also seen as a new frontier of competition between China and the US.As per the news agency PTI, the agreement further solidifies China’s support for Pakistan’s space ambitions, following previous collaborations such as the launch of Pakistani satellites.Pakistan’s first digital communications satellite, Badr-1, was launched aboard a Chinese Long March 2E rocket in 1990, while earlier this year, Pakistan’s CubeSat accompanied China’s Chang’e-6 probe to the Moon.According to Global Times, the selection of the astronaut is expected to take around a year, after which the candidate will undergo intensive training in China. This move, experts say, demonstrates the reliability of China's manned space technology and its willingness to lower barriers for developing countries to participate in space exploration .China has also set ambitious goals for space exploration, with plans to land astronauts on the Moon before 2030.Meanwhile, the US has its sights set on returning to the lunar surface by 2025.","China has signed an agreement with Pakistan to send a Pakistani astronaut to its space station, Tiangong.

Following his father's tragic death, he assumed the roles of vice chancellor at Jamia Darul Uloon Haqqania and chairman of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (Sami).The madressah was established by Islamic scholar Maulana Abdul Haq Haqqani in September 1947, according to the institution's website.Previously, the Madrassa faced scrutiny when its students were alleged to be involved in former prime minister Benazir Bhutto's assassination.

Clock running out for refugees in Islamabad, Rawalpindi



'We've worked with the Americans for years'



Kabul, Islamabad row amid rising crackdown



Forced to move after decades in Pakistan



UN says Pakistan has a tradition of protecting Afghans

A woman who we will call Fatima fled Afghanistan with her family in December 2021. She had worked for an American non-profit organization in Kabul ­until the US pullout in the summer of 2021, when the Taliban retook control of the country.She is now based in the Pakistani capital, Islamabad. And she is in trouble. Her Pakistani visa is days away from expiring, and the authorities are still processing her renewal application.""I am concerned about the renewal of my visa, and if not renewed timely authorities would arrest me and my family for illegally residing in the country,"" Fatima told DW.Police, including female officers, recently conducted a raid on a building where Fatima lives, looking for undocumented Afghan refugees. She was not in the building at the time, but her brother ended up in custody.""Later, we showed them our visa renewal application receipts and proof but police did not cooperate,"" said Fatima, who is now hiding from the authorities.In 2023, Pakistan started a massive initiative to repatriate approximately 4 million Afghans who have entered the country over the past 40 years. And while the authorities granted some leeway last year, Pakistan's government has now set a March 31 deadline to expel foreign nationals residing in the country illegally, with search operations ongoing in January and February.Afghan refugees living in Islamabad and the nearby city of Rawalpindi ""have been verbally asked to leave Pakistan till 28th February,"" Umer Gillani, a legal expert and rights activist, told DW.Moniza Kakar, a lawyer working for refugees advocacy in Pakistan, said there was ""uncertainty and fear"" among the Afghani nationals in the area.""Since the start of this year, over 1,000 Afghans have been detained in Islamabad, and more than 18,000 have been forced to leave Islamabad and Rawalpindi because of government orders,"" she said.Amin, 28, is from Kabul. He spent years collaborating with the United States in the fight against the Taliban in Afghanistan, before he too had to flee across the Pakistani border.Hee said he was just days away from being evacuated to America, but this was put on hold last month with President Donald Trump signing an executive order to suspend a refugee resettlement program.Nearly 20,000 Afghans are presently waiting in Pakistan for approval to resettle in the US through an American government program.""We've worked with the Americans for years, we helped and supported them in Afghanistan, we have given them a part of our lives and they have to support us so that we can live peacefully,"" Amin told DW.Over the last three years, Pakistan's relationship with neighboring Afghanistan has deteriorated. Islamabad holds the Taliban authorities in Afghanistan responsible for their inability to control the operations of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a militant group that formed in 2007 and has conducted numerous attacks on Pakistani security forces.As cross-border tensions with the Taliban regime escalate, concerns were also raised about the well-being of Afghans in Pakistan amid reports of purported intimidation and arrests. The UN special rapporteur has expressed his worries, stating that Afghans in the area deserve more humane treatment.Activist Gilani said millions of Afghan refugees in Pakistan are being used as ""hostages to build pressure whenever there is tension between the two countries.""Last week, Pakistan's Foreign Ministry dismissed claims made by the Afghan representation regarding the mistreatment of Afghan refugees in Pakistan, labeling these allegations as ""misplaced"" and urging Kabul to facilitate the smooth repatriation of Afghan citizens.Pakistan has accommodated hundreds of thousands of refugees from its northern neighbor, a situation resulting from decades of regional instability. Afghans who arrived in Pakistan following the Taliban takeover in August 2021 have been relying on visa renewals to stay in the country, a procedure that is costly, uncertain and often subject to significant delays.""The stories of refugees are devastating. Families who have lived in Pakistan for years, even decades, are now being uprooted due to tensions between the two countries. Children, women, and men who have already suffered so much are being treated as if they don't matter. This is not just a refugee crisis, it's a humanitarian crisis,"" said Kakar.UNHCR's top representative in Pakistan, Philippa Candler, told DW that Pakistan already repatriated over 800,000 Afghan refugees between September 2023 and the end of last year.""As of December 2024, Pakistan hosted over 2.8 million Afghans with 69% of refugees living outside refugee villages,"" she said.Candler acknowledged Pakistan's generosity in hosting Afghan refugees for decades, and the current ""economic and security challenges"" in Pakistan that drive the repatriation efforts.At the same time, UNHCR was urging the Islamabad government to ""see the situation of Afghans through a humanitarian perspective"" and ""continue its long-standing tradition of protecting vulnerable Afghans […] regardless of their status.""""It's essential that we work hand-in-hand with both host countries and countries of origin to develop mechanisms that empower refugees to rebuild their lives in safety and dignity, including voluntary repatriation,"" she said.""We are calling for dialogue between the two countries, and for the refugee issue to be separated from political matters.""","Afghan refugees living in Islamabad and the nearby city of Rawalpindi are in trouble.

New York City is terminating a $220m deal with the Pakistan-owned Roosevelt Hotel to house a migrant shelter following a prolonged MAGA meltdown over use of American taxpayer money to facilitate immigration to the US.Under pressure from the federal government and MAGA hardliners, Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat who gravitated to the Trump orbit after facing corruption charges from the Biden administration, announced closure of the site that is said to have housed tens of thousands of migrants in its 1025 rooms at $ 200 a night.The site opened in May 2023 to serve as both a new arrivals center and shelter for asylum seekers under a three-year $ 220 million deal with government-run Pakistan International Airlines, which owns the hotel, having bought out a Saudi stake in it for $ 36.4million in 2005.At peak traffic in 2023 when around 4000 migrants were arriving in the city each week, the sight of asylum seekers camping outside the hotel waiting to be processed triggered MAGA hardliners and even some New Yorkers, as Trump and his supporters complained about Democrats housing ""illegal immigrants"" in ""luxury hotels"" at the expense of US taxpayers.""A taxpayer-funded hotel for illegal migrants is owned by the Pakistani government, which means NYC taxpayers are effectively paying a foreign government to house illegals in our own country.

Others will judge the sources,” he said as the interim government in Dhaka is set to complete seven months in office.“We are trying to overcome these misunderstandings. There is no problem in our basic relationship (with India),” Yunus told BBC Bangla in an interview. New Delhi’s response to his statement about the bilateral ties being “in good shape” remains to be seen. India had repeatedly cited targeted attacks on Hindus, their temples and businesses in Bangladesh since the ouster of PM Sheikh Hasina on August 5 last year, a charge Yunus denied on different occasions.In Monday’s interview, Yunus said relations between Bangladesh and India is “historically, politically and economically” so deep that even after the recent untoward events, they remained “in good shape” and “will remain good in the future”.He said, “There is no alternative to maintaining good relations... no scope of deviating from them.” Highlighting the “huge interdependence” between the two neighbours, Yunus said there is “continuous communication” between them.He also spoke about the law-and order situation, reforms and elections, the formation of a new student party, and political developments in Bangladesh.",Chief adviser Muhammad Yunus says relations between Bangladesh and India ‘remain positive’ Despite ‘some challenges’ arising from “propaganda’ New Delhi’s response to his statement about the bilateral ties being “in good shape” remains to be seen.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118692027,imgsize-570310,width-400,resizemode-4/118692027.jpg"

DHAKA: Bangladesh chief adviser Muhammad Yunus Sunday stressed the importance of documenting all atrocities committed during the regime of ousted PM Sheikh Hasina , including the crackdown on student movement participants, police brutality against protesters following the verdict against Islamist leader Delwar Hossain Sayeedi, and all extrajudicial killings over the years.""There is a need for proper documentation of all atrocities committed against the peopleWithout such documentation, it is difficult to uncover the truth and ensure justice,"" Yunus said when Gwyn Lewis, the UN resident co-ordinator in Bangladesh, and Huma Khan, senior human rights adviser at Lewis's office, called on him. Lewis informed Yunus that the UN high commissioner for human rights, Volker Turk, will brief member states about its findings on March 5 during the 55th session of the Human Rights Council. UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres will visit Bangladesh from March 13 to 16.Lewis also said the UN is ready to provide technical support and help the people of Bangladesh build their capacity in this regard. ""This is part of the process of healing and establishing truth,"" Yunus's press wing quoted Lewis as saying.Lewis hoped that the upcoming visit of Guterres will bring the Rohingya crisis back to global attention amid dwindling aid supplies. ""We are very concerned about the funding situation,"" she said, adding that every month, $15 million is needed just to ensure food supplies for the Rohingya people, along with other basic needs.","Bangladesh chief adviser Muhammad Yunus Sunday stressed the importance of documenting all atrocities committed during the regime of ousted PM Sheikh Hasina.

Assets scattered all over

Loyal family

Cronies and gifts

Others under scrutiny, too

Months after the ouster of Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina , the interim govt in charge of the country has made her extradition from India a top priority. But her return isn't the only concern; Dhaka is also looking to recover what it says is billions of dollars that the ousted leader's associates siphoned out of the country during the time she was in office.In a report on Feb 28, Financial Times of London focused on acquisitions of one such individual, former Bangladesh land minister Saifuzzaman Chowdhury , saying it amounted to an ""extraordinary real estate empire built up, for the most part, while he served as an MP in the govt of Sheikh Hasina"".FT has identified 482 properties acquired by Chowdury or his close family at a cost of at least $295mn between 1992 and 2024, making him one of the top targets of anti-corruption investigations launched under Nobel Peace laureate Mohd Yunus , the head of the interim govt. The period it is interested in spans the 15 years from 2009 to 2024, when Sheikh Hasina enjoyed an uninterrupted run as Bangladesh PM in her second stint in office.The locations of Chowdhury's properties stretch from Dubai's Burj Khalifa district and the artificial Palm Jumeirah archipelago to flats in London's commuter towns. The surge in Chowdhury's property acquisitions came after he was appointed land minister in 2019, FT said.Before he became Sheikh Hasina's land minister, Chowdhury served as an MP of her party for over five years. In 2023, he declared to Bangladesh parliament assets worth $2.3mn. His last declared income tax return, for 2017, states he had no foreign income at all. FT says other Bangladeshi elites being targeted by the interim govt are estimated to have acquired property worth $578mn in countries ranging from Singapore to Canada.Chowdhury's father Akhtaruzzaman was an Awami League politician and ""close confidant"" of Sheikh Hasina, FT said. He was a member of the founding board of directors of United Commercial Bank, established in 1983. Akhtaruzzaman was accused of being involved in cases of violence related to UCB - including the murder of its founding chairman in 1993 - that FT said the ""interim govt sees as precedent for the forcible takeover of other banks in the final years of Sheikh Hasina's rule"".A report commissioned by Mohd Yunus claimed that Bangladesh lost ""$16bn annually to money laundering under Sheikh Hasina's rule from 2009 to 2024"".FT quoted Yale professor Mushfiq Mobarak as saying that politicians associated with Sheikh Hasina misused the govt to forcibly allow their cronies to take control of large commercial banks and then siphon off ""billions of dollars through 'loans' that would never be repaid"".These cronies obliged the politicians with gifts of real estate abroad.Dhaka has engaged international consultant majors Deloitte, EY and KPMG to perform an asset quality review of Bangladesh's banks and set up joint investigative teams to ""trace the assets of 10 leading families, as well as Sheikh Hasina's"". While the interim govt hasn't specifically named anybody, FT said Bashundhara Group chairman Ahmed Akbar Sobhan and S Alam Group chairman Saiful Alam are among those who have been mentioned by govt officials.FT also quoted Yunus as saying there is ""significant money"" in Canada and that Bangladeshi elites have also bought assets in Dubai, from where it will be tough to make any recovery.","Saifuzzaman Chowdhury is one of the top targets of anti-corruption investigations.

DHAKA: The students’ group which spearheaded the protests that led to the ouster of Sheikh Hasina as prime minister on Friday launched a political party and vowed to root out pro-India and pro-Pakistan politics from the country.The Anti-Discrimination Student Movement or Students against Discrimination turned into ‘ Jatiya Nagorik Party ’ or National Citizen Party at a rally at Manik Mia Avenue in central Dhaka near parliament with one of the key leaders of the July-Aug protests , Na hid Islam, 26, as its convener.The top leadership of the party, said to have the blessings of the interim govt and Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami, doesn't have any representation from minority communities. “The re will be no place for pro-India and pro-Pakistan politics in Bangladesh.

Myanmar Internet Shutdowns: Myanmar: Why is junta shutting down internet?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/myanmar-why-is-junta-shutting-down-internet/articleshow/118624045.cms,"Dozens of shutdowns coincide with atrocities

Civilians left with no info on troop movements

Starlink as a lifeline

'Shutdowns are never acceptable'

The world witnessed nearly 300 internet shutdowns last year, with 85 of those in Myanmar alone, according to a new report by Access Now, a non-profit organization focused on digital rights.The Southeast Asian country is still in the grip of a fierce civil war between the ruling junta and various rebel factions. The junta started imposing internet shutdowns when a nationwide armed resistance erupted in the wake of the February 2021 coup. Initially the military authorities insisted the shutdowns were for ""stability"" to prevent what they described as fake news. But four years on, according to the Access Now report , those shutdowns have gotten worse.Titled Emboldened offenders, endangered communities: internet shutdowns in 2024, the document details scores of local, regional and nationwide outages mostly orchestrated by the military officials.""For the fourth consecutive year, the Myanmar military remained one of the world's worst perpetrators of internet shutdowns in 2024 — clear evidence of the junta's blatant disregard for the international human rights order and increasing weaponization of connectivity to disempower people in Myanmar,"" said Wai Phyo Myint, Asia Pacific policy analyst at Access Now.The Myanmar military ordered 76 out of 85 disruptions. Interestingly, the Chinese government imposed two cross-border shutdowns in Myanmar and Thailand imposed four, with rebel administrators and unknown actors listed as responsible for the remaining ones.Sometimes, the shutdowns would only affect mobile connectivity or only broadband internet. In other occasions, the blackout would be complete.The overwhelming majority of them were imposed in conflict areas.The Access Now report found that 31 shutdowns coincided with documented grave human rights abuses in Myanmar and at least 17 shutdowns imposed by the junta correlated with airstrikes on civilians.Toe Zaw Law, a veteran journalist from Myanmar, said the junta was trying to control the narrative inside the country.""It's no surprise. Myanmar has one of the worst censorships on digital platforms,"" he told DW.""[The military does this] so most of the people can't access independent information or internet mainly, especially young people. They just want one version of truth, the army's version of truth. They make sure there is no independent access to information,"" he added.On January 1, a new cybersecurity law was enacted in Myanmar, banning the use of VPNs, and penalizing users who share information from banned websites. An unauthorized installation or use of a VPN can now be punished with up to 6 months in prison, and a fine.The effects of the blackouts and the new, draconian internet laws go beyond just propaganda warfare. Areas controlled by the rebels bear the brunt of the restrictions, according to a report published by Fulcrum, an analytical online outlet focusing on Southeast Asia.""For the junta, taking these areas off-grid is a two-pronged strategy: to disrupt the flow of information among resistance groups and to isolate these areas from global attention.""""In resistance-controlled areas, civilians have relied on the internet for critical updates on military movements or warnings about airstrikes. An internet blackout and VPN ban effectively blind these communities, making them sitting targets,"" the report adds.Some anti-junta media organizations and rebel militias are now relying on Starlink — a satellite-based internet connection service by the US-based company SpaceX. But this technology is expensive, hard to obtain, and tricky to access in the war-torn country.Wunna Khwar Nyo, editor-in-chief at Western News, a media outlet focusing on news in Myanmar's Arakan state, says the internet shutdowns have brought his newsroom in Rakhine to a standstill.""Last year, we faced a lot of difficulties. Western News journalists and staff went to [other] places to access an internet phone line. We went for an hour on a motorbike to send the news,"" he told DW.""Currently, we are using Starlink to access the internet. This is only available for a few hours"" for journalists in the country, he added. ""On the other hand, our editors-in-exile publish the news regularly.""Myanmar is one of the world's most dangerous countries for journalists, with several reporters killed in custody since the 2021 coup. Statistics published by the Committee to Protect Journalists for 2024 indicate that a Myanmar reporter is over 18 times more likely to be jailed in the war-torn country than they would be in China, when adjusting for population.But the Access Now report shows other, less oppressive Asian countries are also experiencing deliberate internet shutdowns. The Asia-Pacific region was the worst in the world in 2024, with 202 shutdowns imposed in 11 countries or territories.Raman Jit Singh Chima, Asia-Pacific policy director at Access Now, said there is a rise of digital authoritarianism in Asia.""Shutdowns destabilize societies, undermine digital progress, put entire communities at risk, and provide a cloak of impunity for human rights abuses. Authorities from Myanmar to Pakistan are isolating people from the rest of the world with impunity, reflecting the rising digital authoritarianism in Asia,"" he told DW.""No matter what method — cable cuts, orders to telcos, or confiscating equipment — shutdowns are never acceptable. The international community must come together and act now to end shutdowns permanently.""","The world witnessed nearly 300 internet shutdowns last year, with 85 of those in Myanmar alone. The Southeast Asian country is still in the grip of a fierce civil war between the ruling junta and various rebel factions. The military authorities insisted the shutdowns were for ""stability"" to prevent what they described as fake news.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118624150,imgsize-1320969,width-400,resizemode-4/118624150.jpg"

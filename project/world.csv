Donald Trump takes his oath of office as the 47th US president

On the first day of his second presidency, President Donald Trump signed a series of executive orders including rescinding 78 Biden-era executive actions, giving time to TikTok to avoid ban in US and announcing US' pullout from WHO. The first set of orders were signed at the Trump's inaugural parade.Here's a look at the first set of orders signed by President Donald TrumpIn an effort to preserve the popular social media platform TikTok, Trump signed an executive order extending its operating timeline by 75 days. The order gives TikTok’s China-based parent company more time to find a US buyer, following national security concerns about the platform’s ownership. Trump’s intervention comes after his earlier push to ban TikTok during his first term.The executive order signed by President Donald Trump begins the process of withdrawing the US from the World Health Organization (WHO), marking the second attempt in less than five years.The order cites the WHO's mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic, its failure to adopt necessary reforms, and its perceived political bias as primary reasons for the withdrawal. It also criticises the WHO's disproportionate financial demands on the US, noting that China, with a larger population, contributes significantly less.The order states that the US intends to formally notify the United Nations of the withdrawal. Trump had previously attempted to withdraw in 2020, but President Biden reversed the decision upon taking office. This new order will go into effect while Trump remains in office for his second term.In a bold move to reshape US immigration policy, Trump signed an executive order directing the Department of Justice and Homeland Security to prepare for invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. This law could allow the deportation of gang members deemed foreign terrorists. Trump’s order targets criminal organizations such as MS-13 and Tren de Aragua, which he claims control illegal traffic across the southern border.Trump also reinstated a policy to end federal grants to sanctuary cities and communities that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities. This action aligns with his broader approach to reducing illegal immigration and reasserting federal authority on the issue.Trump revived his efforts to challenge birthright citizenship in the US, an issue that has been part of his immigration agenda for years. His order seeks to end the automatic citizenship granted to anyone born on US soil, a practice enshrined in the 14th Amendment. Though legal challenges are expected, Trump insists that this move will bring the country closer to his vision of stricter immigration control.Trump signed a sweeping execution order on Monday directing the attorney general to ensure states have adequate lethal injection drugs for executions.The order also mandates the pursuit of the death penalty in federal cases involving law enforcement officers or crimes committed by illegal immigrants. Trump's directive comes after a federal execution moratorium imposed under the Biden administration, with only three inmates left on federal death row. The move also aims to override Supreme Court rulings limiting capital punishment.Trump signed an order halting offshore wind lease sales and pausing permits and approvals for onshore and offshore wind projects. Citing environmental concerns and economic costs associated with intermittent electricity generation, this order calls for a comprehensive review of wind leasing practices. Trump’s energy policies aim to promote drilling for oil and gas over renewable energy sources like wind power.Trump signed a memorandum allowing interim six-month security clearances for some of his aides while their federal background checks are pending. These clearances, which grant access to classified government information, will expedite the transition of his staff and ensure they are able to function effectively in their roles, particularly in areas related to national security.Trump made bold statements on international relations with a series of executive orders, including temporarily suspending all US foreign assistance programs for 90 days while reviews are conducted to ensure they align with his administration's goals.In one of his most controversial moves, Trump issued pardons and commutations for about 1,500 people involved in the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot. The pardons were seen as a fulfillment of Trump’s campaign promise to release his supporters convicted in the violent attack. This act signals his unwavering support for those who stormed the Capitol in an attempt to disrupt the 2020 election certification.Trump began the signing of orders with first eight signed at the inaugural parade before he moved on to sign other orders at the White House.His initial set of orders included revoking 78 Biden-era measures, including protections for sex discrimination, transgender military service, and private prison contracts. He also froze new federal regulations, except for emergency regulations, to reduce federal oversight.Trump imposed a federal hiring freeze, halting the filling of vacant civilian positions with exceptions for military and public safety roles. He also mandated federal employees return to in-person work, ending remote work arrangements.To address the cost-of-living crisis, Trump signed an order targeting rising housing, fuel, and healthcare costs, blaming Biden’s policies. His plan focuses on reducing regulations that increase prices, with agencies required to implement cost-reducing measures.The US also withdrew from the Paris climate agreement, continuing Trump’s 2017 stance. An order to protect free speech was also signed, preventing federal censorship and criticizing previous efforts to limit speech on social media.Trump also aimed to end the ""weaponization"" of the federal government, directing reviews of misconduct by law enforcement and intelligence agencies.","Trump signs executive orders on border, citizenship, TikTok and more.

'We're leaving office, we're not leaving the fight,' Joe Biden says as he thanks his staff

Former President Joe Biden addressed supporters and staff at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland on Monday afternoon, delivering a farewell speech on the day of Donald Trump 's inauguration. In his speech, Biden emphasized the need for continued efforts and asserted that they're ""not leaving the fight"" even after departing the White house.Biden, 82, spoke as Trump was addressing his own supporters, acknowledging the challenges ahead and the importance of perseverance.""Look, I know from many years of experience, there are ups and downs, but we have to stay with it,"" Biden said, recalling his father's lesson. ""My dad taught me the measure of a person is how quickly they get up when they get knocked down - and that's what we have to do right now,"" he added to his speech.""We never give up - we're leaving office - but we're not leaving the fight,"" he declared, urging his administration members to remain engaged in various capacities, whether in the public or private sector, or even by running for office themselves.Biden expressed gratitude for his team's ""incredible"" work and said serving as their president was the honor of his life. The crowd chanted, ""Thank you, Joe,"" as he concluded his speech before boarding the Nighthawk 46 helicopter with his wife, Jill, to begin their post-presidential life.In his final hours in office, Biden issued a series of presidential pardons , setting a record for any president. He pardoned family members, including his brother James and his wife Sara, his sister Valerie and her husband John Owens, and his brother Francis, in response to what he called ""unrelenting attacks"" by Trump and his allies.Among others pardoned were Dr. Anthony Fauci, who led the US public health response to the coronavirus pandemic, and members of the committee that investigated the January 6 insurrection . On Friday, Biden also announced the reduction of sentences for nearly 2,500 people convicted of non-violent drug offenses and commuted the death sentences of 37 individuals to life imprisonment.","Former President Joe Biden addressed supporters and staff at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland on Monday afternoon.

Trump secures first cabinet member as Senate confirms Marco Rubio as secretary of state,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-secures-first-cabinet-member-as-senate-confirms-marco-rubio-as-secretary-of-state/articleshow/117410500.cms,"Marco Rubio before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for his confirmation hearing last week

The Senate swiftly confirmed Marco Rubio as secretary of state on Monday, voting unanimously to give President Donald Trump his first Cabinet member on Inauguration Day. The vote was decisive at 99-0, with Rubio being among the least controversial of Trump's nominees.Another pick, John Ratcliffe for CIA director, is also expected to have a swift vote, while action on others, including former combat veteran and Fox News host Pete Hegseth for defense secretary, is expected later in the week. Senate Majority Leader John Thune moved quickly, saying he expected voting to begin ""imminently"" on Trump's nominees.""Marco Rubio is a very intelligent man with a remarkable understanding of American foreign policy,"" Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, the senior-most Republican, said as the chamber opened. It's often tradition for the Senate to convene immediately after the inauguration to begin putting the new president's team in place, particularly the national security officials.Democrats have calculated it's better for them to be seen as more willing to work with Trump, rather than simply mounting a blockade to his nominees. They're holding their opposition for some of his other picks who have less support, including Tulsi Gabbard for director of national intelligence and vaccine skeptic Robert F Kennedy Jr for health secretary.Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said his party will ""neither rubber-stamp nominees we feel are grossly unqualified, nor oppose nominees that deserve serious consideration."" He added that Rubio is an example of ""a qualified nominee we think should be confirmed quickly.""Senate committees have been holding lengthy confirmation hearings on more than a dozen of the Cabinet nominees, with more to come this week. Several panels are expected to meet late Monday to begin voting to advance the nominees to the full Senate for confirmation.The Senate foreign relations committee advanced Rubio's nomination late Monday, while the Senate armed services committee and Senate intelligence committee advanced the nominations of Hegseth and Ratcliffe, respectively.As secretary of state, Rubio would be the nation's top diplomat and the first Latino to hold the position. Born in Miami to Cuban immigrants, he has long been involved in foreign affairs, particularly in South America, and has emerged as a hawk on China's rise.During his confirmation hearing, Rubio highlighted concerns about America's ""unbalanced relationship"" with China. While sharing Trump's anti-globalist views, he's recognised as an internationalist who values American global engagement.Rubio anticipates support from both parties. He would succeed Antony Blinken , who expressed hope for continuity in Middle East policies regarding Gaza and Ukraine's defence against Russian aggression.The Senate is split 53-47, but the resignation of Vice President JD Vance drops the GOP majority to 52 until his successor arrives. Republicans need almost every party member in line to overcome Democratic opposition to nominees, with objection from any one senator forcing the Senate into procedural steps that would drag voting later into the week.","Marco Rubio confirmed as secretary of state on Monday.

Barron Trump’s role in the campaign

Barron Trump has turned 'LADIES' MAN'?!

“He knows his generation”

Where does Barron Trump study?

Will Barron live in the White House?

Barron Trump, the president-elect’s only child with his wife Melania, has been acknowledged for having a notable influence on his father during the election campaign. At the inauguration, all eyes were on Barron again who stood out ofr his remarkable height. The youngest child of president-elect Donald Trump is 6 feet 8 inches tall, making him as tall as LeBron James. At just 18 years old, Barron stands approximately 6 feet 8 inches tall. Remarkably, this may make him the tallest child of a US president in history.According to his mother, Melania Trump, Barron, the youngest son of Donald Trump, played a “very vocal” role in the 2024 presidential election campaign. The 18-year-old helped his father connect with younger voters, contributing to his November election victory.“I’m very proud of him for his knowledge, even about politics and giving advice to his father,” Melania said during an appearance on the Fox News show Fox & Friends last month. “He brought in so many young people. He knows his generation because, nowadays, the young generation, they don’t sit in front of the TV anymore. They’re all on tablets, phones, podcasts, and streamers.“He was very vocal, and he gave advice to his father. It was incredible how he contributed to the campaign’s success because he knew exactly who his father needed to connect with.”Born in New York City on 20 March 2006, Barron is Melania’s only son and Donald Trump’s fifth child. In September 2024, he began his first year at the Stern School of Business at New York University.Unlike many students, Barron is not living in the NYU dorms. Instead, he resides at Trump Tower in Midtown Manhattan.Speaking on Fox & Friends last week, Melania confirmed that Barron will continue living in New York but will have a room at the White House. This arrangement will allow him to visit with friends whenever he wishes.“Yes [he can bring his friends with him], whatever he would like to do,” Melania said. “I feel that we have our children until they’re about 18 or 19 years old. We teach them, guide them, and then give them the wings to fly. I always respect Barron’s ‘yes’ and ‘no’—what he likes to do and where he wants to be.”","Barron Trump, the president-elect’s only child with his wife Melania, has been acknowledged for having a notable influence on his father during the election campaign.

In a glittering celebration of style and politics, Vice President-elect JD Vance and his wife, Usha, hosted a spectacular dinner at the National Gallery of Art on Saturday evening, serving as a significant prelude to the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump . The event, which also functioned as a reception for Trump’s cabinet selections, was a perfect blend of political significance and glamour.Dressed impeccably for the occasion, the Vances exuded sophistication. Vice President-elect JD Vance donned a classic tuxedo, embracing the formal tone of the evening, while his wife, Usha Vance, wore a custom noir black velvet gown by Oscar de la Renta. The dress featured asymmetrical floral accents and a sweetheart neckline, combining elegance with contemporary style and captivating many onlookers.The designer shared photos of the couple from the ceremony on their official Instagram account. The caption read: “Incoming Second Lady, Usha Vance, wears a custom noir velvet gown with asymmetric floral accents and a sweetheart neckline for the Vice President’s Dinner.”The story of JD and Usha began in the halls of Yale Law School, where they met as students. At that time, JD was vocal about his atheism, having drifted from the Christian faith he was raised in. Yale Law was where he began questioning many aspects of his life, including his worldview and spiritual beliefs, influenced by his tumultuous upbringing in Ohio, as documented in his memoir Hillbilly Elegy. While JD entered law school as a self-described atheist, his relationship with Usha sparked a journey of spiritual exploration.Raised in a Hindu family with deeply ingrained spiritual practices, Usha’s upbringing instilled a sense of devotion, introspection, and a search for purpose, which resonated with JD.Usha’s approach to life and faith became a steadying force for JD, inspiring him to revisit spiritual questions that had long been dormant. Hinduism, with its emphasis on inner peace, self-discipline, and moral duty (dharma), encouraged JD to explore faith beyond mere ritual and dogma. Usha’s perspective helped JD see religion not just as a set of rules but as a path to personal growth, resilience, and understanding—qualities that would eventually shape his political career.In 2014, JD and Usha married in a ceremony that included both Christian and Hindu elements, symbolising a fusion of their faiths and cultural identities. This blending of traditions was significant, marking the beginning of JD’s journey back to Christianity while honouring Usha's Hindu heritage. The marriage ceremony embodied respect for each other’s beliefs, laying the foundation for JD’s eventual conversion to Catholicism, a decision deeply influenced by Usha’s faith journey.For JD, being with Usha brought a newfound respect for the role of spirituality in providing guidance, purpose, and resilience. Her encouragement helped him understand that faith could be a private, personal journey, rather than a public declaration of belief. Gradually, he found himself attending church services, drawn back to the teachings he had left behind in his youth. By 2018, JD had officially returned to the Christian faith, converting to Catholicism. This transformation, though rooted in Christianity, was infused with the spiritual openness that Hinduism often encourages—a respect for different pathways to self-understanding and fulfilment.As JD rose in the political arena, Usha’s Hindu values continued to influence his approach to leadership and policy. Hinduism emphasises duty to one’s community and a moral obligation to uplift society—ideals that have informed JD’s focus on rural America’s struggles and the working class, as seen in his advocacy for middle-American families. The Hindu philosophy of karma yoga, or selfless service, resonated with JD’s desire to address the issues facing his hometown and others like it across the US.JD’s renewed commitment to faith also reshaped his political philosophy. While he had previously held anti-establishment views that often came across as harsh and critical, his relationship with Usha helped him temper this outlook with empathy and a commitment to service. Her influence guided him toward policies focused on economic justice, family welfare, and community values, aligning with the Hindu principle of seva (service).The 2024 election saw JD Vance emerge as the vice-presidential candidate on Donald Trump’s ticket, representing a new era in the GOP. His marriage to Usha, an Indian-American woman rooted in Hindu spirituality, has introduced a unique cultural dimension to the political discourse. This has opened up a dialogue on how diverse backgrounds can enrich American politics, setting an example for cross-cultural understanding and respect.For the Indian-American community, the presence of Usha Vance in the White House signals a historic representation of Hindu values in American leadership. Usha’s Telugu heritage and commitment to her faith resonate with many Indian-Americans, who see her as a symbol of the community’s growing influence in the US. Her fluency in Telugu, and her familiarity with Indian culture, strengthen her potential role as a bridge between the US and India, contributing to a richer, multicultural approach to governance.Usha’s role in the White House holds significance beyond her influence on JD’s faith journey. As an Indian-American, she brings insights that could bolster US-India relations. With her understanding of Indian cultural and religious nuances, Usha is uniquely positioned to facilitate diplomatic conversations that respect cultural heritage, fostering goodwill between the two nations. Her presence in the administration underscores the shared values of family, spirituality, and duty that bind both countries.Moreover, Usha’s background as a Yale-educated attorney with clerkships under Supreme Court justices reflects the potential for intellectual and diplomatic contributions in policy matters, particularly those that intersect with cultural and international relations. Her blend of Hindu spirituality and American legal training is likely to add a nuanced perspective to her husband’s administration, aligning with the increasing recognition of South Asian contributions to American society.Usha Vance’s Hindu faith has been transformative in JD Vance’s personal and spiritual journey, helping him reconnect with Christianity while deepening his understanding of spirituality’s role in public service. Their story exemplifies how interfaith partnerships can enrich personal and professional lives, fostering empathy, tolerance, and a broadened worldview. This union has not only been a cornerstone of JD’s political and moral evolution but also serves as a testament to the growing diversity in American politics.With JD Vance poised to take on the role of Vice President, his journey from atheism to faith, spurred by Usha’s Hindu beliefs, adds a powerful narrative to the American political landscape. It is a story of transformation, resilience, and the unifying potential of faith across cultural divides. Through this partnership, the Vances embody a modern vision of America—one that celebrates diversity and draws strength from shared values, making their story an inspiring chapter in the ongoing journey towards a more inclusive nation.","Vice President-elect JD Vance and his wife, Usha, hosted a spectacular dinner at the National Gallery of Art on Saturday evening.

Arriving at President-elect Donald Trump’s Inauguration on a bitterly cold day in Washington, Fetterman donned his signature black hoodie, gray gym shorts, and sneakers, defying both the frigid temperatures and traditional dress codes.With temperatures hovering around 20°F and wind chills in the teens, Washington had declared a cold weather emergency ahead of the event. The swearing-in ceremony itself was moved indoors due to the dangerously low temperatures. Yet, the 55-year-old senator seemed unfazed, powering through the icy conditions in his casual attire.Fetterman’s unconventional wardrobe has been his hallmark throughout his career, even in settings that typically demand more formal attire. While he has occasionally complied with Senate dress codes — wearing a suit and tie while presiding over proceedings — he is known for pushing the boundaries of political fashion. At last year’s White House Correspondents’ Association dinner, for instance, he opted for a tuxedo hoodie instead of traditional black-tie apparel.His outfit at the inauguration quickly went viral on social media, sparking a mix of reactions. Admirers applauded his relatability and connection to everyday Americans.“The dude represents the 'common man,' so there’s nothing wrong with dressing like the common man. I love this, personally!” one user wrote.“Normal attire for him. I thought I’d hate him, but he’s actually one of the most sensible Democrats in Washington,” another chimed in.Others, however, criticised his choice as inappropriate for such a significant national occasion.“It’s appalling and disrespectful to the country,” one commenter argued. “Maybe next time a national ceremonial process happens, Republicans should show up in their pajamas too.”“Zero class. Zero respect for the presidency. Zero respect for himself. It’s embarrassing,” another user wrote.","John Fetterman wore a black hoodie, gray gym shorts, and sneakers to the inauguration.

With a hint of surprise, he exclaimed, ""Oh,"" admitting he might not have discovered the letter for months if not for the reporter's timely reminder.The lighthearted exchange briefly shifted focus from policy to tradition as Trump teased the idea of reading the note aloud to the assembled reporters. Ultimately, he set the letter aside, leaving its contents a mystery for now.","President Trump was reminded of a long-standing presidential tradition by Fox News White House correspondent Peter Doocy.

In one of the first actions for his second term, US President Donald Trump issued pardons to over 1,500 individuals charged in the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack, including leaders of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers organisations.""These are the hostages,"" Trump declared from the Oval Office, referring to the convicted and charged defendants. ""Approximately 1,500 for a pardon – full pardon.""""We hope they come out tonight,"" Trump said.This presidential clemency extends to hundreds previously convicted of serious offences, including police assault and property destruction during attempts to interfere with the power transition process.Justice Department figures indicate over 730 individuals received misdemeanour convictions related to January 6. Additionally, approximately 300 cases remain active as of Monday, with numerous defendants facing serious felony charges, including police assault.The seven-hour siege resulted in injuries to more than 140 police officers and led to the deaths of four Trump supporters and five police officers, both directly and indirectly.The subsequent FBI and Justice Department investigation became the largest criminal investigation in US history, resulting in charges against more than 1,580 individuals and securing approximately 1,270 convictions.Justice Department statistics show that 55% of January 6 prosecutions involve minor offences like trespassing or disorderly conduct. Most convicted individuals received probation or brief prison sentences and have been released.The defendants include elderly individuals caught in the moment and others who briefly entered the Capitol without causing damage or harm. Many lack criminal records, and numerous participants claim they never intended to enter the building or disrupt the 2020 election certification process, with some stating police allowed their entry.Despite Trump's characterisation of January 6 as ""a day of love and peace"" with supporters posing ""zero threat,"" extensive video evidence shows violent confrontations between protesters and police, including attacks with various weapons and physical altercations.According to a report from CNN, Craig Sicknick, brother of US Capitol police officer Brian Sicknick who died following the insurrection, has openly opposed these pardons through a liberal advocacy group's petition, stating it enables rioters to ""evade responsibility.""""Donald Trump and his loyalists not only celebrate the deadly mob that killed my brother — they are determined to pardon those responsible,"" Craig Sicknick said in the message. ""It is a betrayal to not only the families and loved ones of those who were injured and killed but to all Americans.""On Monday, Republican senator Mike Rounds reflected, ""there was violence. This was this was not peaceful. People were in harm's way, and it was a very, very bad day for America."" Whilst acknowledging the president's constitutional pardon authority, he emphasised focusing on the future.","US President Donald Trump issued pardons to over 1,500 individuals charged in the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack.

Executive order amid LA wildfires

Withdrawal process requires one year

Half of Americans oppose withdrawing from accord

Trump's second term could severely impair future climate efforts

US President Donald Trump has announced the United States' second withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement , at the Capital One Arena in Washington during his inaugural parade event. This decision by one of the world's largest carbon polluters undermines international efforts to address global warming and sets the US apart from its allies. The announcement, made as Trump began his second term on Monday, mirrors his 2017 stance.The agreement aims to restrict long-term global warming to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) above pre-industrial levels, or at minimum, maintain temperatures below 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) above pre-industrial levels.The voluntary Paris agreement of 2015 enables nations to establish their own targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel consumption. These targets are intended to become progressively stricter, with countries required to submit new plans by February 2025. The departing Biden administration recently proposed reducing US greenhouse gas emissions by over 60 per cent by 2035.Laurence Tubiana, CEO of the European Climate Foundation and a principal architect of the Paris agreement, acknowledged the US withdrawal as unfortunate but emphasised that climate action transcends individual national policies.The current situation differs significantly from 2017, according to Tubiana, noting substantial economic momentum in the global transition, which the US has benefited from but might now lose.The International Energy Agency projects the global market for essential clean energy technologies will reach over $2 trillion by 2035, tripling its current size.Tubiana pointed to the severe wildfires in Los Angeles as evidence that Americans, like others worldwide, are experiencing the intensifying effects of climate change.Gina McCarthy, former White House climate adviser under President Biden, stated that achieving American leadership in the global economy, energy independence, and job creation requires continued focus on expanding the clean energy sector.Current global temperatures exceed mid-1800s levels by 2.3 degrees Fahrenheit (1.3 degrees Celsius). Most climate monitoring organisations reported that global temperatures surpassed the 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit warming threshold last year, unanimously declaring it the warmest on record.The Paris accord withdrawal process requires one year. Trump's previous withdrawal became effective the day after the 2020 presidential election, which he lost to Biden.Despite the initial shock of Trump's first withdrawal from the UN agreement - endorsed by 196 nations - no other country followed suit, according to Alden Meyer, a veteran climate negotiations analyst at E3G.Other nations, along with US investors, businesses, governors, and mayors, maintained their commitment to addressing climate change, experts noted.Nevertheless, they expressed concern about the loss of US leadership in global climate initiatives, particularly as the world faces increasingly severe weather events and record temperatures.""Clearly America is not going to play the commanding role in helping solve the climate crisis, the greatest dilemma humans have ever encountered,"" said climate activist and writer Bill McKibben. ""For the next few years the best we can hope is that Washington won't manage to wreck the efforts of others.""AP-NORC Centre polling indicates approximately half of Americans oppose withdrawing from the climate accord. Republican support for withdrawal is not overwhelming, with slightly less than half in favour and about one-fifth opposed.China surpassed the United States as the largest annual carbon dioxide emitter several years ago. The US, now second, emitted 4.9 billion metric tonnes of carbon dioxide in 2023, an 11% reduction from a decade earlier, according to Global Carbon Project scientists.However, due to carbon dioxide's atmospheric longevity, the US remains historically responsible for nearly 22 per cent of carbon dioxide emissions since 1950.Experts worry that a second Trump term could severely impair future climate efforts, potentially influencing other nations, particularly China, to reduce their environmental commitments.UN climate change executive secretary Simon Stiell remains hopeful about US participation in the global clean energy transition, warning that non-participation would benefit competitor economies while climate-related disasters intensify.",US President Donald Trump has announced the United States' second withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement.

More than 48km of anti-scale fencing were erected all over the US capital. Surveillance drones flooded the skies. But if Washington looks like a war zone again, it does not necessarily feel that way. Unlike the last time Donald Trump took the oath of office eight years ago, the bristling tension and angry defiance have given way to accommodation and submission. The Resistance of 2017 has faded into the Resignation of 2025.Much of the world, it seems, is bowing down to Trump. Over the past weeks, tech moguls have rushed to Mar-a-Lago. Billionaires have signed seven-figure cheques for the inaugural ceremony. Some corporations have pre-emptively dropped climate and diversity programmes to curry favour.Some Democrats are talking about working with the newly restored Republican president on discrete issues. Some news groups are perceived to be reorienting to show more deference. The grass roots opposition that put hundreds of thousands of people in the streets of Washington to protest Trump just a day after he was sworn in back in 2017 generated a fraction of that in their sequel on Saturday. “Hashtag-resistance has turned into hashtag-capitulation,” said David Urban, a Republican strategist. “Pink-pussy hats are gone, and they are replaced by MAGA hats.”For both the progressive left and the Never Trump right, this second inauguration has upended all the assumptions after 8 years of fighting Trump. Their strategies failed to keep him out of office. And many of them have grown drained and demoralised. “It’s a bitter pill to swallow, but it’s not the end. We shall rebuild,” said Donna Brazile, an ex-Democratic National Committee chairwoman.For the Trump team, on the other hand, it is a moment of triumph and celebration. And this time, Trump arrives at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue not as a fluke Electoral College winner. He took oath Monday with a burst of momentum propelled by a victory in the popular vote.Some of the deference being shown to Trump now stems from a broader sense that perhaps popular opinion is more on Trump’s side than they had assumed. A new NYT-Ipsos survey found that even many Americans who dislike Trump agree with some of his diagnosis of the country’s problems and some of his prescriptions, including mass deportation of undocumented immigrants. And so dispirited opponents face a period of introspection before they return to the arena.","The Resistance of 2017 has faded into the Resignation of 2025.

ISLAMABAD: Zalmay Khalilzad , the former US special envoy for Afghanistan during Donald Trump’s first term as president, said on Monday that Afghan deputy foreign minister Shir Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai ’s remarks calling upon his government to scrap the ban on education for women was a “promising development”.Stanikzai’s rare public criticism coincided with ongoing international pressure on Afghanistan ’s leaders to lift restrictions on women’s access to public life in general and to allow girls to attend secondary schools and beyond. He made a direct public appeal to the country’s reclusive leader, Hibatullah Akhundzada, to lift the ban and called the exclusion of girls from education an “injustice” on part of the Islamic Emirate against half of Afghanistan’s 40-mn population.“The whole world has a problem with us on this issue. They criticise us for it. But the path we have taken is a matter of our own liking, not the Sharia,” Stanikzai said.Welcoming the stance, Khalilzad highlighted that Stanikzai is an important IEA official who played a key role in the Doha negotiations . As special envoy for Afghanistan, Khalilzad was lead negotiator during the Doha talks.He also asked Afghan religious scholars and leaders of the Islamic Emirate who privately oppose the ban on girls’ education to make their opposition public. Further, he emphasised that schools and universities should be reopened by the beginning of the new solar year, in late March.After the Taliban took control of Afghanistan in 2021, Akhundzada had imposed his strict interpretation of Sharia law through dozens of decrees, mainly restricting girls’ access to education beyond the sixth grade and banning the majority of women from working or participating in public life.Last August, the Taliban announced a new law on the promotion of virtue and prevention of vice, which bars women from traveling or using public transportation without a male guardian. The law requires women and girls to cover their faces in public and prohibits them from singing in public or letting their voices be heard outside the house.","Afghan deputy foreign minister Shir Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai called upon his government to scrap the ban on education for women.

ISLAMABAD: The first commercial flight landed at Pakistan’s new Gwadar International Airport on Monday following a months-long delay in the opening of the Beijing-funded facility in volatile Balochistan province.The airport’s opening was postponed from Aug 14 to the end of 2024 due to a security review sparked by a series of deadly attacks by separatist militants in Balochistan, in Pakistan’s southwest. Then, on Jan 10, the airport was due to open, but this was again delayed.“The $246-million Chinese-backed project is expected to grow into one of Pakistan’s biggest airports and serve both domestic and international travel,” the Pakistan Aviation Authority (PAA) said in a statement.“Pakistan achieved a landmark moment in its aviation history on Monday as the first commercial flight successfully landed at the new Gwadar International Airport,” the statement read, adding the new airport is poised to play a pivotal role in connecting Pakistan to global markets and facilitating trade, tourism, and economic development.PIA Flight PK-503 departed from Karachi at 9.50 am and touched down at the airport at 11.15 am, carrying 46 passengers. In a video shared by PAA, the PIA flight was seen being greeted by a traditional water salute by water bowsers as it landed.China has pledged more than $65 billion for infrastructure, energy, and other projects in Pakistan under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ). As part of President Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Pakistan is also creating a deep-water port near the new Gwadar airport, a joint venture between Pakistan, Oman, and China that is nearing completion. Chinese people and projects have been frequently attacked in the past by separatists who view Beijing as a foreign invader trying to gain control of impoverished but mineral-rich Balochistan, the site of a decades-long insurgency.Recent attacks, including one in Oct 2024 in which two Chinese workers were killed in a suicide bombing in Karachi, have forced Beijing to publicly criticise Pakistan for security lapses. In recent months, the media has widely reported that China wants its own security forces on the ground to protect its nationals and projects, a demand Islamabad has long resisted.","PIA Flight PK-503 departed from Karachi at 9.50 am and touched down at the airport at 11.15 am, carrying 46 passengers.

Inauguration ceremony

Economic and strategic significance

Challenges in Balochistan

Future prospects

Pakistan’s largest airport, funded and constructed by China in the restive Balochistan province , officially became operational on Monday, marking a significant milestone in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) initiative.The inaugural ceremony at Gwadar International Airport witnessed the arrival of a Pakistan International Airlines flight from Karachi. Defense Minister Khawaja Mohammad Asif and Chinese officials were present, celebrating the $230 million project, which has a capacity to handle 400,000 passengers annually.The event followed the virtual inauguration of the airport earlier this year by Chinese Premier Li Qiang and Pakistan’s former Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.Built under Chinese President Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the airport aims to bolster trade and attract international investment. It complements the deep-sea port in Gwadar, positioning the coastal city as a key regional trade hub.“The airport will play a crucial role in improving the economy, fostering international investment, and bringing prosperity to Balochistan,” Asif stated during the ceremony.The airport, spanning 4,300 acres, can accommodate various aircraft, including ATR 72, Airbus A-300, and Boeing 747, for both domestic and international routes, according to the Ministry of Planning and Development.The project’s completion faced delays due to increased attacks by separatists in Balochistan, who oppose Chinese investments and accuse them of economic exploitation. The region has long been plagued by an insurgency demanding greater autonomy or independence.Ethnic Baloch groups have criticized the development projects, claiming they benefit outsiders while leaving local communities marginalized.Despite the challenges, Gwadar International Airport symbolizes deeper Pakistan-China ties and reflects China’s strategic interest in the region. The airport is expected to enhance connectivity, trade, and tourism while contributing to the broader goals of the Belt and Road Initiative.As the largest airport in Pakistan by area, the Gwadar facility is set to become a vital link in regional and international trade, though its success depends on addressing ongoing security and political concerns in the province.","Gwadar International Airport is Pakistan’s largest airport, funded and constructed by China in the restive Balochistan province.

ISLAMABAD: A pre-Partition place of worship of the minority Ahmadi community was completely demolished by the local administration in Punjab’s Sialkot district, Pakistani media reported on Saturday.The place was built by Chaudhry Zafarullah Khan , Pakistan’s first foreign minister and an Ahmadi by faith, in his native town of Daska, Sialkot. A renowned lawyer in British India, he was a crucial champion for the Ahmadi cause in significant trials.This historical structure was razed on Jan 16, two days after local authorities claimed that an extension of the structure was illegal as it encroached 13 feet onto a public road, a claim rejected by community members.Despite this, Amir Mahmood, spokesperson for the marginalised community, said they had complied with the govt notice and a wall was constructed on the inner side on Jan 15, but the area’s assistant commissioner, accompanied by police, proceeded with the demolition the next day and flattened the entire structure. “It is clear that using the illegal encroachments as an excuse, the administration targeted and demolished the Ahmadi community’s place of worship,” Mahmood said, adding the structure had not been altered or extended since its original construction by Khan’s family before Partition. He blamed the local administration for continuously targeting the community’s properties and ignoring their grievances.The operation lasted from 7pm until 11pm, and electricity to the place of worship and neighbouring areas was also cut off. The action was not strictly administrative as during the entire time, locals said, a number of people had gathered chanting provocative slogans against the persecuted community. This was the latest in a series of actions targeting Ahmadis. According to data, at least 22 of their places of worship were destroyed across Punjab in 2024.","A pre-Partition place of worship of the minority Ahmadi community was completely demolished by the local administration in Punjab.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's former Prime Minister Imran Khan condemned the court's verdict in the Al Qadir Trust case, calling it a ""mockery"" of justice and pledged to fight till the last ball and refuse any deals, The Express Tribune reported.In a statement shared on social media platforms Facebook and X, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan condemned the court's decision in the Al Qadir Trust case, calling it a premeditated move with the verdict and sentencing already leaked to the media before the official announcement.Khan called the judicial process a ""mockery"" of justice and said that the individuals who wrote the judgement leaked it to the media, undermining the integrity of the legal system, according to The Express Tribune report. PTI founder reiterated his stance against the "" military-backed regime "" and vowed to never accept it.He said, ""I will continue my struggle for true freedom and democracy, even if it means spending more time in jail,"" while emphasising that he will make no compromise on his principles or the fight for Pakistan's true independence, The Express Tribune reported.Imran Khan pledged to continue fighting for democracy, the rule of law, and true freedom for the people of Pakistan. He said, ""We will fight till the last ball, and I will not make any deals. I will face all the false cases brought against me.""He called on the people of Pakistan to read the Hamoodur Rahman Commission Report and compare it to the actions of General Yahya Khan, who he claimed similarly caused the downfall of Pakistan. He said that the current rulers were following the same path, acting in their personal interests and pushing Pakistan towards destruction.On Al-Qadir Trust case , PTI founder accused the judiciary of causing further damaging to its credibility and added that judges who backed ""military rule"" and acted as per their instructions were given rewards. He said that the case should have been focused on Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) supremo Nawaz Sharif and his son for allegedly selling their property worth 9 billion pound to a business tycoon for 18 billion pound, raising questions on the source of their wealth and why they had not given the requested receipts in the Panama Papers case.He accused Pakistan's former chief justice Qazi Faez Isa of facilitating money laundering in the Hudaibiya Paper Mills case , where billions of rupees were forgiven. On Al-Qadir University, Khan called the institution as non-profit, welfare-focused project like other educational ventures like Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Namal University.PTI founder said that he and his wife, Bushra Bibi , did not gain any financial benefit from the university. He called the decision a deliberate attempt to target his wife, Bushra Bibi, who he said has faced repeated false charges and her punishment was part of a broader attempt to pressure him by hurting his family, The Express Tribune reported.He said, ""My wife is a housewife with no connection to politics. She has always stood by me, considering these challenges as tests from Allah.""On negotiations with government, Khan warned that if no progress was made on establishing a judicial commission for May 9 and November 26 incidents, the discussions would be pointless and accused the government of evading accountability.Imran Khan made the remarks after an accountability court in Rawalpindi sentenced Imran Khan to 14 years in prison and Bushra Bibi to 7 years in the 190 million pound Al-Qadir Trust case. After the verdict, Imran Khan's wife was arrested in the court.In addition, Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi were asked to pay a fine of PakistRupees (PKR) 1 million and PKR 500,000 respectively.

"Imran, wife sentenced to jail in corruption case",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/imran-wife-sentenced-to-jail-in-corruption-case/articleshow/117340821.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Jailed Pakistani former prime minister Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi , were sentenced to 14-year and seven-year jail terms, respectively, after an accountability court found the couple guilty of corruption by receiving land as a bribe from a Pakistani real-estate czar.The makeshift court operating from Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi, where Khan has been incarcerated since Aug 2023, had reserved its verdict three times in the £190-million (about Rs 2,003 crore in Indian currency) Al-Qadir Trust case since Dec last year. Following the ruling, Bushra was arrested from the courtroom.Accountability court judge Nasir Javed Rana also fined Khan Pakistani Rs 1 million ($3,500), while Bibi was fined half that amount.Failure to pay the fines would result in an additional six months in jail for Imran and three months for Bushra, the judge said.According to the verdict, the property of the “sham trust Al-Qadir University Project Trust is hereby forfeited to the federal govt”.“Both convicts are present before the court; they be taken into custody in this case and be handed over to the jail superintendent along with the committal warrant to serve the sentences so awarded,” it added.The couple were indicted in the case on Feb 27, 2024, shortly after the general elections.The case alleges that Khan and his wife had acquired land worth billions of rupees (millions of US dollars) for the Al-Qadir Trust from Malik Riaz Hussain, a prominent property tycoon in Pakistan, to establish a nonprofit educational institute for the poor. In return, Pakistan’s anti-corruption watchdog alleged, Khan’s govt from Aug 2018 to April 2022 had provided legal cover to Riaz’s black money (£130 million), which Britain’s National Crime Agency had recovered and handed over to the Pakistan govt.This has been the fourth major case in which the former cricket star has been convicted. Last year, Khan was convicted in cases related to selling state gifts, leaking state secrets, and unlawful marriage, all of which were later overturned or suspended by the Islamabad high court. Despite this, Khan remains behind bars, with dozens of cases pending against him. He describes the cases as a political witch-hunt.Khan was first arrested in connection with the Al-Qadir Trust case on May 9, 2023, spending just two days in detention. However, the arrest had sparked nationwide protests during which Khan’s supporters had stormed govt buildings and military installations in multiple cities.Speaking to reporters inside the courtroom after his conviction, Imran rejected the notion of striking a deal with anyone to get himself freed from prison. “I will neither make any deal nor seek any relief,” he told reporters, adding that those who stand against dictatorship are punished.His Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI)condemned the conviction as a continuation of “bogus persecution” against Khan and his wife. “While the party awaits the detailed decision, it is important to note that the Al Qadir Trust case against Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi lacks any solid foundation and is bound to collapse,” the PTI said. “All evidence and witness testimonies confirm that there has been no mismanagement or wrongdoing. Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi are merely trustees, with no further involvement in the matter,” it added.","Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, were sentenced to 14-year and seven-year jail terms, respectively.

Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was killed in Pakistan by US forces in 2011, and a Pakistani militant, currently detained in Guantanamo Bay, is believed to have been the chief mastermind of those attacks.Critics were quick to voice their concerns online.

In June 2020, the airline was banned from flying to the European Union, UK, and US after one of its Airbus A-320 planes crashed in Karachi, killing nearly 100 people. The disaster was blamed on human error by the pilots and air traffic control, and it was later revealed that a significant number of pilots had dubious or fake licences.In 2016, a PIA plane caught fire after one of its engines failed during a flight from the remote north to Islamabad, killing over 40 people.In November, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency lifted the ban on PIA, citing “sufficient confidence” in the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority’s oversight. However, the airline remains barred from flying in the UK and the US.PIA continues to fly to multiple cities across Pakistan, including in the mountainous north, and also serves destinations in the Gulf and Southeast Asia.Despite the backlash, Khan noted that the airline’s return to Europe has been welcomed with positive feedback.

Bangladesh cancels Hasina's visa

Former Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has revealed details of an alleged assassination plot against her and her sister, Sheikh Rehana, after her ousting from power. ""Rehana and I survived—just 20-25 minutes apart, we escaped death,"" Hasina said in an audio message posted on the Bangladesh Awami League 's Facebook page.The 76-year-old leader was ousted from power, fleeing to India last year after a student-led revolution toppled her government amid protests and clashes that claimed over 600 lives.Reflecting on the events, Hasina alleged a coordinated conspiracy to eliminate her and described surviving multiple assassination attempts as a divine intervention.""I feel it is the will of Allah that I have survived—the August 21 grenade attack , the Kotalipara bomb plot , and now this recent threat,"" she said emotionally. ""Otherwise, I wouldn't be alive today.""""I just feel that surviving the killings on August 21, or surviving the huge bomb in Kotalipara, surviving on this time August 5, 2024, there must be a will of Allah, a hand of Allah"", the deposed PM said, adding, ""although I am suffering, I am without my country, without my home, everything has been burned.""This is not the first time that there has been an assassination plot against Hasina the August 21, 2004, grenade attack, which targeted Hasina during an anti-terrorism rally in Dhaka, killed 24 people and injured over 500.

They had previously been sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment in the case, which SC termed ""malicious"".Following the verdict, there are now no legal barriers preventing the two-time former PM from contesting the upcoming national elections. Khaleda and her son are currently residing in London.SC overturned the judgments delivered during the regime of ousted PM Sheikh Hasina by the high court and trial court. The trial court had sentenced Khaleda to five years' imprisonment, while Tarique and the other accused received 10 years each. Later, HC doubled Khaleda's sentence to 10 years while upholding trial court's verdict for the other accused.In its ruling, SC observed that the prosecution of the Zia Orphanage Trust case was ""malicious"" and noted that the accused, who did not appeal the HC verdict, would also benefit from this judgment ""restoring their dignity as innocent individuals"".A five-member bench of the appellate division, led by Chief Justice Syed Refaat Ahmed, delivered the unanimous verdict. The ruling came after hearings on two appeals filed by Khaleda and individual appeals made by Kazi Kamal and businessman Sharafuddin Ahmed. Khaleda had initially been jailed on Feb 8, 2018 after a special court in Dhaka sentenced her to five years in prison for her involvement in the case.

"Bangladesh commission suggests dropping 'secularism', 'socialism' from Constitution; proposes bicameral House",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-commission-suggests-dropping-secularism-socialism-from-constitution-proposes-bicameral-house/articleshow/117279914.cms,"The Constitution Reform Commission on Wednesday submitted its report to interim government chief Muhammad Yunus , proposing the replacement of the state principles of secularism, socialism and nationalism. The commission set up by the Yunus administration, after the ouster of Sheikh Hasina as prime minister following a mass agitation led by students, also proposed a bicameral parliament for the country and a two-term limit on a premier's tenure.The three principles are among the four enshrined as ""fundamental principles of state policy"" in the country's constitution. Under the new proposals, only one -- ""democracy"", remains unchanged.""We are proposing five state principles -- equality, human dignity, social justice, pluralism, and democracy -- for reflection of the great ideals of the 1971 Liberation War and the people's aspiration during the 2024 mass upsurge,"" commission chairman Ali Riaz said in a video statement.The report kept ""democracy"" alone in the constitution's preamble alongside the four new principles as it presented the report to Yunus.The chief advisor's press wing in a statement quoted Riaz as saying the commission recommended the formation of a bicameral parliament with a lower house named the National Assembly and an upper house named the Senate with 105 and 400 seats respectively.The report suggested both the proposed houses will have a term of four years instead of the existing five-year term of the parliament.The commission suggested the lower house be based on majority representation and the upper one on proportional representation.The commission believes that one of the main reasons the ""autocratic authoritarianism Bangladesh"" faced over the past 16 years was because of the absence of an institutional power balance and concentration of power in the prime minister's office.It recommended a two-term limit on the premier's tenure.The report said, therefore, it proposed the creation of a constitutional body named the National Constitutional Council to establish a system of checks and balances between the three branches of the state and the two executive positions - the prime minister and the president.This council would include the president, the chief justice, the prime minister and the leader of the opposition (both elected through the parliament), speakers of both houses, deputy speakers from the opposition, and a representative of other parties.The report said the commission believes this institution would ensure transparency and accountability in the appointment process as a constitutional body.Riaz said the commission proposed the reintroduction of the referendum system for amending the constitution. Under the existing provisions, the parliament on its own can amend the constitution with a two-thirds majority.Bangladesh's constitution has been amended so far 17 times since it was framed in 1971, a year after the emergence of independent Bangladesh following a nine-month Liberation War against Pakistan.The leaders of the Anti-Discrimination Students Movement that led the July-August uprising toppling then prime minister Sheikh Hasina's nearly 16 years Awami League regime called the constitution a ""Mujibist"" charter, a reference to Bangladesh's founding leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Hasina's father.They demanded scrapping of the ""Mujibist 1972 Constitution"". However, this has been opposed as well by Awami League's arch-rival former prime minister Khaleda Zia's Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP).The BNP on Tuesday formally demanded general elections in July-August this year, opposing Yunus's expressed desire to stage the polls by the year-end or mid-2026 after accomplishing some basic reforms.However, after an overnight meeting of the highest policy-making steering committee with the party's acting Chairperson Tarique Rahman in London through a virtual platform BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir said reform was a continuous process.He said the BNP was committed to reforms as it has always been at the ""forefront of reforms as in 2016 we presented 'Vision 2030', and in 2023 we introduced a 31-point plan"".Most of her senior leaders and cabinet colleagues are on the run at home and abroad while some are in jail to face graft and criminal charges as the ruthless crackdown on the campaigners claimed several hundred lives.","The Constitution Reform Commission submitted its report to interim government chief Muhammad Yunus.

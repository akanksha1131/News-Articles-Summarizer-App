How did this 7-year-old boy brave lions and leopards for five days in a Zimbabwe zoo?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/how-did-this-7-year-old-boy-brave-lions-and-leopards-for-five-days-in-a-zimbabwe-zoo/articleshow/116930567.cms,"A seven-year-old boy was rescued after spending five days lost in the dense and predator-rich Matusadona National Park in northern Zimbabwe .The wildlife authority, ZimParks, confirmed the miraculous incident on Friday.Tinotenda Pundu, a young boy from a village bordering the vast reserve, disappeared into the park on December 27. The Matusadona National Park, known for its landscapes and thriving wildlife, is equally notorious for its treacherous terrain and apex predators, including lions, leopards, and buffaloes. Many who wander into its depths often do not return.Rangers, locals, and police initiated a frantic search for Tinotenda, but heavy rains hampered their efforts. On December 30, his footprints were discovered, reigniting hope. Early the next day, Tinotenda was found approximately 50 kilometers (about 30 miles) from his village, a testament to his remarkable survival instincts.“Remarkably, it is estimated that he walked through the harsh terrain of the lion-infested Matusadona National Park for 49 kilometers,” ZimParks spokesperson Tinashe Farawo said in a statement. Tinotenda survived by foraging for wild fruits and digging into riverbanks to find water, a survival technique familiar to communities in Zimbabwe’s drought-prone regions.Mutsa Murombedzi, a local lawmaker, described the boy’s survival as a miracle. “He was clever enough to sleep on perched rocks, keeping himself out of reach of lions and other wildlife,” she told AFP.Villagers had tried to lure Tinotenda back by playing drums, hoping he would follow the sound, but it was the rangers’ expertise that ultimately led to his rescue.The boy, frail but unharmed, was immediately admitted to a hospital. Matusadona National Park, nestled near Lake Kariba, spans approximately 1,470 square kilometers (570 square miles) and has long been a sanctuary for diverse wildlife.According to the nonprofit African Parks, the reserve once boasted the highest density of lions in Africa and served as a crucial stronghold for elephants and black rhinos. However, for those like Tinotenda, who inadvertently venture too deep, the park’s beauty can quickly turn perilous.","Tinotenda Pundu, a young boy from a village bordering the vast reserve, disappeared into the park on December 27.

Paetongtarn's father's wealth

Former PM's assets

'Money plays a crucial role in political activities'

Thailand's Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra on Friday declared over $400 million in assets, which include more than 200 designer handbags, 75 luxury watches, and more. Her political party confirmed the declaration, which was filed with the National Anti-Corruption Commission (NACC).The declaration shows Paetongtarn possesses assets totaling 13.8 billion baht (approximately $400 million), according to an AFP report. This includes investments worth 11 billion baht, and an additional one billion baht in cash and deposits. Her assets also include 75 watches valued at 162 million baht, another 39 timepieces, and 217 handbags worth 76 million baht. She also owns property in London and Japan.According to a document from the NACC shared by local media, she also reported liabilities of nearly five billion baht, resulting in a net worth of 8.9 billion baht ($258 million).Paetongtarn, the daughter of former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra , assumed office in September. She is the fourth member of her family to lead the Thai government in the past two decades.Paetongtarn's father, Thaksin, has an estimated net worth of $2.1 billion, making him the 10th-richest person in Thailand, according to Forbes. Thaksin once owned Manchester City football club.Thaksin leveraged the wealth from his Shin Corp telecommunications empire to enter politics, and his family has continued to hold significant influence, even during his years in exile after being overthrown in a coup.Paetongtarn's predecessor, Srettha Thavisin , had declared assets of 985 million baht when dismissed from office in August. This was a decrease from his initial declaration of 1.02 billion baht at the start of his term.Yuttaporn Issarachai, an analyst from Sukhothai Thammathirat University, said that there is a vital relationship between wealth and politics in Thailand.""In a nation without a fully functioning democracy, money plays a crucial role in political activities. This has often been the justification for military interventions, with claims of a lack of transparency,"" Issarachai said.","Thailand's Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra declared over $400 million in assets.

A decorated US Army soldier, Matthew Livelsberger , fatally shot himself in a Tesla Cybertruck shortly before it exploded near the Trump hotel in Las Vegas on New Year’s Day. Investigators said on Friday that Livelsberger left notes saying the explosion was meant as a ""wake-up call"" about the country’s problems.Livelsberger, a 37-year-old Green Beret from Colorado Springs, Colorado, served in the US Army since 2006 and deployed twice to Afghanistan. In notes found on his cellphone, he wrote that he needed to ""cleanse"" his mind of the brothers he had lost and relieve himself of the burden of lives he had taken.He also described the explosion as a spectacle meant to draw attention to societal issues, writing, ""This was not a terrorist attack"", adding, ""Americans only pay attention to spectacles and violence. What better way to get my point across than a stunt with fireworks and explosives?""The explosion caused minor injuries to seven people and did not damage the Trump International Hotel. Authorities stated that Livelsberger acted alone. His notes mentioned a range of topics, including political grievances, societal problems, and issues such as the war in Ukraine. In one note, he said that the US was ""terminally ill and headed toward collapse.""Assistant Sheriff Dori Koren of the Las Vegas metropolitan police department said Tesla engineers helped investigators access data from the Cybertruck, including Livelsberger’s travel path from Colorado to Las Vegas. Investigators are still reviewing a large amount of data, including videos, photos, documents, and web history.Officials said Livelsberger did not harbor ill will toward US President-elect Donald Trump. In one note, he called for the country to ""rally around"" Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Neither Trump nor Musk was in Las Vegas at the time of the explosion.FBI Special Agent Spencer Evans described the incident as a suicide by a combat veteran struggling with PTSD and other challenges. Livelsberger died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Investigators have not yet explained how he managed to shoot himself while igniting the explosives in the Cybertruck.Items found inside the vehicle included two firearms, fireworks, a passport, a military ID, credit cards, and electronic devices. Both guns were legally purchased.Livelsberger had confided to a former girlfriend, Alicia Arritt, about physical and mental health struggles, which she attributed to traumatic brain injury, news agency AP reported. Arritt shared text messages where Livelsberger described his pain and exhaustion, saying his life had become difficult.Livelsberger, who served in Afghanistan, Ukraine, Tajikistan, Georgia, and Congo, had recently returned from Germany and was on approved leave at the time of his death. He was awarded five Bronze Stars, a combat infantry badge, and an Army Commendation Medal with valor.Authorities also searched his home in Colorado Springs. Neighbours said he lived there with his wife and baby and described him as a typical neighbour.The explosion occurred hours after another incident in New Orleans, where Shamsud-Din Bahar Jabbar drove a truck into a crowd, killing at least 14 people.

South Korea in political crisis after president resists arrest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/south-korea-in-political-crisis-after-president-resists-arrest/articleshow/116930444.cms,"Members of the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions shout slogans demanding arrest of impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol in Seoul, South Korea, Friday, January 3, 2025.

SEOUL: South Korea's political leadership was in uncharted territory Saturday after the sitting president resisted arrest over a failed martial law decree days before the warrant expires.In scenes of high drama on Friday, Yoon Suk Yeol's presidential guards and military troops shielded the former star prosecutor from investigators, who called off their arrest attempt citing safety concerns.The South Korean president was impeached and suspended last month after the bungled martial law declaration -- a political move swiftly overturned by parliament -- with a separate warrant later issued for his arrest.""There was a standoff. While we estimated the personnel blocking us to be around 200, there could have been more,"" an official from the investigation team said Friday on condition of anonymity.""It was a dangerous situation.""Yoon faces criminal charges of insurrection, one of a few crimes not subject to presidential immunity, meaning he could be sentenced to prison or, at worst, the death penalty.If carried out, the warrant would make Yoon the first sitting president ever arrested.Since his impeachment, Yoon has holed up in his presidential residence in the capital Seoul, where he has refused to emerge for questioning three times.The unprecedented showdown -- which reportedly included clashes but no shots fired -- left the arrest attempt by investigators in limbo with the court-ordered warrant set to expire on Monday.Officials from the Corruption Investigation Office (CIO), which is probing Yoon over his martial law decree, said there could be another bid to arrest him before then.But if the warrant lapses, they would have to apply for another from the same Seoul court that issued the initial summons.The Constitutional Court slated January 14 for the start of Yoon's impeachment trial, which if he does not attend would continue in his absence.Former presidents Roh Moo-hyun and Park Geun-hye never appeared for their impeachment trials.Yoon's lawyers decried Friday's arrest attempt as ""unlawful and invalid"", and vowed to take legal action.Experts said investigators could wait for greater legal justification before attempting to arrest the suspended president again.""It may be challenging to carry out the arrest until the Constitutional Court rules on the impeachment motion and strips him of the presidential title,"" Chae Jin-won of Humanitas College at Kyung Hee University told AFP.- 'Stable path' -South Korean media reported that CIO officials had wanted to arrest Yoon and take him to their office in Gwacheon near Seoul for questioning.After that, he could have been held for up to 48 hours on the existing warrant. Investigators would have needed to apply for another arrest warrant to keep him in custody.Yoon has remained defiant despite the political impasse he initiated with his December 3 decree.He told his right-wing supporters this week he would fight ""to the very end"" for his political survival.By the time investigators attempted to execute the warrant for Yoon's arrest, he had layered his presidential compound with hundreds of security forces to prevent it.Around 20 investigators and 80 police officers were heavily outnumbered by around 200 soldiers and security personnel linking arms to block their way after entering the presidential compound.A tense six-hour standoff ensued until early Friday afternoon when the investigators were forced to U-turn for fear of violence breaking out.The weeks of political turmoil have threatened the country's stability.South Korea's key security ally, the United States, called for the political elite to work towards a ""stable path"" forward.National Security Council spokesman John Kirby reaffirmed Washington's commitment to maintaining bilateral ties and readiness to respond to ""any external provocations or threats"".Outgoing US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is scheduled to hold talks in Seoul on Monday, with one eye on the political crisis and another on nuclear-armed neighbour North Korea.","Yoon Suk Yeol's presidential guards and military troops shielded the former star prosecutor from investigators.

Who is Morgan Ortagus?

'Morgan fought me for three years'

US President-elect Donald Trump on Saturday announced that former state department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus will serve as deputy special presidential envoy for Middle East Peace during his second administration. She will be working under Steven Witkoff , Trump's nominee for special envoy to the Middle East.Trump announced the appointment of Ortagus on his Truth Social platform.""I am pleased to announce Morgan Ortagus as Deputy Special Presidential Envoy for Middle East Peace, to the Honorable Steven Witkoff,"" Trump said in his post.Morgan Ortagus has a background in diplomacy and national security and currently serves as an active US navy reserve intelligence officer.Between 2019 and 2021, she was the spokesperson at the department of state under Mike Pompeo, where she contributed to the historic Abraham Accords, which achieved unparalleled peace in the Middle East, according to Trump.Before her role at the state department, she served as a financial intelligence analyst at the department of the treasury and, from 2010 to 2011, was the deputy US treasury attaché to Saudi Arabia.""Morgan Ortagus has had experience in Diplomacy and National Security, and is an active US Navy Reserve Intelligence Officer.

‘Breaking Bad’ house is now up for sale-Here’s how much you need to pay to own it,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/breaking-bad-house-is-now-up-for-sale-heres-how-much-you-need-to-pay-to-own-it/articleshow/116930113.cms,"A Brush with Hollywood

The house that became an iconic symbol in the world of television is now up for sale, drawing attention not just from potential homeowners but from “Breaking Bad” fans worldwide. Situated in a quiet Albuquerque neighborhood, this unassuming home is the backdrop to some of the most memorable scenes from the series, and now, its owners are hoping to cash in on the property’s Hollywood fame.While the average price for a home in the area hovers around $400,000, this property’s connection to “Breaking Bad” has elevated its value to much higher heights.According to an Associated Press report, the home is currently listed for just under $4 million for a four-bedroom ranch-style house. David Christensen of eXp Luxury, who is handling the listing, said that the response has been overwhelming since the property went live on the market. Investors are already eyeing the potential to turn the house into a vacation rental or even a museum dedicated to the series.“Breaking Bad,” which followed the transformation of Walter White and Jesse Pinkman from ordinary men to notorious drug dealers, wrapped up over a decade ago. Yet, the legacy of the show continues to live on, not only through reruns and fanfare but also through the show’s filming locations around New Mexico, particularly the house that stood in as Walter White’s home.Recently, New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham tapped Bryan Cranston, who portrayed Walter White, to help launch a state campaign against littering.For Joanne Quintana, the decision to sell is bittersweet. Her parents purchased the home in 1973, and she grew up there with her siblings. But as the fame of “Breaking Bad” surged, so did the crowds. Fans of the show began flocking to the house in droves, some days seeing hundreds of cars driving past. It became impossible for the family to protect the property and their privacy, leading to the installation of a metal fence and security cameras to keep the enthusiasts at bay.“Now that my parents are gone, it’s time to sell. This was our family home for almost 52 years,” Quintana shared in an interview with TV station KOB-TV. “We’re walking away with just our memories. It’s time to move on.”It was in 2006 when a film scout first knocked on the door, asking if the house could be used for the pilot episode of “Breaking Bad.” The family, welcoming as ever, agreed, never imagining the magnitude the show would eventually reach. They had the chance to meet the stars, including Bryan Cranston, and even watched behind the scenes. Quintana’s mother often kept the cast and crew well-fed with homemade cookies.While the interior of the home was used for preparatory shots, all actual interior scenes were filmed in a studio. However, the backyard became the stage for one of the most infamous moments in the show: the pizza toss. Quintana recalls the crew’s meticulous setup for the scene, with dozens of unsliced pizzas ready in case Cranston didn’t land the pie on the roof on his first attempt. But as fans know, he did. The iconic pizza throw was just one of many unforgettable moments at this house.Though the show’s impact has been massive, the homeowners have faced difficulties keeping fans from trying to replicate the pizza toss or sneak into the backyard pool to relive the show’s most memorable moments.","The Albuquerque home where ""Breaking Bad"" was filmed is now up for sale for $4 million.

UnitedHealthcare ex-employee reveals how company taught them to deny claims: 'Get the client off the phone',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/unitedhealthcare-ex-employee-reveals-how-company-taught-them-to-deny-claims-get-the-client-off-the-phone/articleshow/116802025.cms,"UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was shot dead on December 4. Luigi Mangione was arrested on charges of the killing.

Majority of Americans don't blame Luigi Mangione solely



'Supervisors laughed as patients cried for money'



A former UnitedHealthcare employee has revealed that they were systematically trained to deny medical claims and the training went for the first two or three months with supervisors standing behind and monitoring how quickly the representative is getting off the call. Natalie Collins told NewsNatoions that there was no instruction on how to actually pay the claim but the entire training was about different ways to deny the claim.“We weren’t given proper instruction to actually pay the claim, and there wasn’t enough monies in certain files in certain companies to pay medical claims,” Collins said. “We would have to just get the client off the phone as fast as we could.”UnitedHealthcare sprang to the news after its CEO Brian Thompson was murdered in front of a New York hotel. 26-year-old Luigi Mangione was arrested on charges of the murder but he pleaded not guilty. Mangione was not a customer of UnitedHealthcare but according to the investigators, he took up the murder as vigilante work.Apart from the online lionization of Mangione because of his looks, and Ivy League college education, the majority of Americans don't hold Luigi Mangione solely responsible for Brian Thompson's death. They blame health insurance profits and coverage denials too for the murder of Thompson. An NORC poll reveals that 8 in 10 adults said that Mangione has a ""great deal"" or a ""moderate amount"" of responsibility for the December 4 shooting but about 7 in 10 adults said denials for health care coverage by insurance companies or the profits made by health insurance companies also bear at least a ""moderate"" amount of responsibility.Earlier, Prison consultant Sam Mangel who is working with other inmates at the Metropolitan Detention Center revealed that Luigi Mangione is sleeping on a mattress that's 2 inches thick at best and has no separate pillow.Collins, the former UnitedHealthcare staff, said the supervisors used to laugh as desperate patients used to cry for money. Collins quit her position after attempting to approve payment for a widowed mother of five whose husband died of pancreatic cancer. The supervisors ihad instructed her to deny the claim and get the caller of the phone line. “They just wouldn’t allow me to submit the claim. There would be alerts on each claim telling us that either we had to put it back in our queue and it would just go to someone else, 30 days later, 60 days later,” Collins said.Collins said she condemns violence though she understands public anger. “I don’t believe anyone should die … but people are angry. People have reasons to be very angry, and I feel that to my bones.

, a 42-year-old Texas native and US army veteran, used a rented pickup truck to mow down revelers on Bourbon Street in New Orleans, killing 14 and injuring dozens. The New Orleans tragedy unfolded with chilling efficiency. Surveillance footage showed Jabbar maneuvering his rented F-150 Lightning around barricades, accelerating into a dense pedestrian zone in the heart of the city’s tourist district. Witnesses described chaos and carnage as the truck plowed through the crowd, flying an Islamic State ( Isis ) flag from its rear. Moments later, Jabbar was dead following a shootout with police, but the shockwaves of his act reverberated across the country.

The FBI labeled the attack an act of terrorism after discovering that Jabbar had pledged allegiance to Isis hours before the massacre. An Isis flag was found in the truck, and investigators confirmed he acted alone.

Jabbar was killed in a shootout with police moments after his rampage.

Why it matters

The tragedy has renewed scrutiny on the enduring influence of jihadist propaganda and the challenges of preventing lone-wolf attacks.

The New Orleans massacre is the deadliest Isis-inspired attack on US soil in years, underscoring the ongoing threat of ""mowing machine"" tactics—using vehicles as weapons of mass destruction.

Adding to the complexity, Jabbar’s profile defies typical expectations for jihadist recruits. A former soldier with a corporate job and no known connections to organized terror groups, his radicalization journey raises critical questions about how Isis’s online propaganda resonates with vulnerable individuals in the West.

His descent into radicalism took family and friends by surprise. His half-brother, Abdur Jabbar, described him as “charismatic” and “loving,” with no outward signs of anger or hatred.

However, personal struggles may have made Jabbar susceptible to Isis’s influence. He had faced financial difficulties following a divorce and was dealing with the aftermath of his father’s stroke. A series of religious audio recordings made by Jabbar a year before the attack, posted on SoundCloud, reveal his adoption of increasingly radical views, including condemning music and intoxicants.

Zoom in: Isis’s 'mowing machine' strategy

The concept of using vehicles as weapons first gained traction with al-Qaida, which in 2010 published a guide in its Inspire magazine detailing how to maximize casualties in such attacks. Isis later expanded on these ideas, emphasizing the psychological impact of ramming attacks.

reflects the tactic's gruesome intent: to plow through dense crowds, causing maximum carnage. Isis’s 2016 publication described using heavy vehicles like trucks to target pedestrian areas, using vivid language like “crushing bones” to inspire fear, a study by the Mineta Transportation Institute said.

These attacks are devastatingly effective because they require minimal resources. A rented truck is readily available in any city, and the spontaneity of such attacks makes them difficult to detect or prevent.

Low barriers to entry: Unlike bombings or shootings, vehicle ramming requires no specialized equipment or extensive planning.

Attackers blend into normal traffic until the moment of action, catching law enforcement off guard. Experts say Isis has shifted its focus from organizing coordinated operations to inspiring lone actors through online platforms. Social media and encrypted messaging apps like Telegram have become critical tools for recruitment, allowing individuals to feel part of a global community without ever meeting another member of the group.

Psychological vulnerability: Experts suggest that personal crises, such as Jabbar’s divorce and financial troubles, can create fertile ground for radical ideologies to take root.

Experts suggest that personal crises, such as Jabbar’s divorce and financial troubles, can create fertile ground for radical ideologies to take root. Decentralized terror: Jabbar’s attack exemplifies Isis’s decentralized strategy, where individuals act in its name without direct orders, making detection even harder.

The big picture: A global pattern

According to the study by the Mineta Transportation Institute, vehicle ramming attacks have seen a marked increase globally since 2014, coinciding with a surge in jihadist propaganda advocating their use.

70% of the 184 documented vehicle attacks between 1963 and 2019 occurred after January 2014. These incidents resulted in 481 fatalities, highlighting the lethality of this tactic. Notably, jihadist-motivated attacks, which constituted just 10% of the total incidents, were responsible for 30% of all fatalities, underscoring their disproportionately high impact, the study said.

Geographically, the United States has experienced 39 vehicle attacks, resulting in 25 deaths, while countries like France and the United Kingdom have seen deadlier incidents. The 2016 Bastille Day attack in Nice remains the most catastrophic, with 86 fatalities, and illustrates the devastating potential of these low-tech methods.

Urban centers with dense pedestrian traffic are particularly vulnerable, and rental vehicles—used in 9% of all documented attacks—account for 29% of fatalities due to their strategic targeting of high-profile events and crowded areas. These statistics underline the enduring and global nature of the threat posed by vehicle ramming.

Between the lines

Jabbar’s attack is part of a broader resurgence of Isis-inspired violence. Although the group’s territorial ""caliphate"" was dismantled in 2019, its ideological influence persists, particularly among disaffected individuals in the West.

A reconstituted threat: Isis has increased its operations in Africa and Afghanistan, using social media to amplify its message globally.

Unrelenting propaganda: The group has also exploited global events, such as the Israel-Gaza conflict, to bolster recruitment and fuel anger among sympathizers.

The contagion effect of such attacks—where one incident inspires others—poses a long-term challenge for counterterrorism efforts.

The group’s ability to inspire violence across continents underscores the enduring appeal of its narrative of grievance and apocalyptic vision. In the aftermath of the New Orleans attack, SITE Intelligence Group reported celebratory chatter among Isis supporters online, with one user declaring, “If it’s a brother, he’s a legend. Allahu Akbar.”

Shamsud-Din Jabbar , a 42-year-old New Orleans terrorist who pledged allegiance to Isis, left behind a chilling scene in his North Houston trailer home—complete with bomb-making materials , a Quran open to a passage glorifying violence, and signs of a life spiraling into chaos.On New Year’s Day, Jabbar drove a rented Ford F-150 Lightning into the heart of Bourbon Street , mowing down revelers at 3 am in a gruesome rampage. Fourteen people were killed, dozens injured, and Jabbar himself died in a shootout with police. Federal investigators have ruled it an act of terrorism The video posted by the New York Post showed a workbench in Jabbar’s bedroom set up for assembling explosives. Nearby, his Quran stood prominently atop a bookshelf, opened to Verse 9:111, which reads: “They fight in Allah’s cause, and slay and are slain; a promise binding…” The verse, widely interpreted as a call to violence by extremist ideologies, cast a haunting shadow over his already sinister acts.This passage, investigators believe, fueled Jabbar’s radicalization . It was the same ideology he embraced in chilling videos posted online minutes before his attack, where he declared his allegiance to Isis and issued threats, including to his own family.The aftermath of the FBI raid on Jabbar’s trailer painted a picture of a man living on the edge. The home was in disarray, with the front door kicked down, cabinets flung open, and furniture overturned.His main bedroom held a keffiyeh in the closet and bomb-making tools on the workbench—ominous signs of his dark turn. Despite the mess, the home seemed eerily as if he had just left, with clothes and belongings scattered about.Jabbar’s trailer home painted a grim portrait of his descent into extremism . Chemical residues and bottles filled the property, with an inventory left behind by FBI agents listing compounds commonly used in bomb-making. A rolled-up prayer rug and numerous Islamic books further hinted at his radicalization.Yet, the home also bore traces of his fragmented personal life. A back bedroom was cluttered with children’s toys and bunk beds—remnants of his role as a father to two daughters, aged 15 and 20.Hours before his attack, Jabbar told neighbors he was leaving for New Orleans for a new IT job. The lie was soon laid bare as the same white truck he drove off in became his weapon of mass destruction.Once an Army staff sergeant, Jabbar served ten years, including deployments to Afghanistan from 2009 to 2019. But after leaving active duty in 2015 and the reserves in 2020, his life unraveled. Financial woes from two divorces, a failed real estate career, and struggles as an IT specialist marked his civilian years.Despite his quiet demeanor, Jabbar’s radicalization had alarming roots. In videos posted before his attack, he not only declared loyalty to Isis but also threatened to murder his own family. His younger brother, Abdur Jabbar, expressed shock: “This is more some type of radicalization, not religion. He was a sweetheart really, a nice guy, a friend, really smart, caring.”","Shamsud-Din Jabbar left behind bomb-making materials, an open Quran and signs of a life spiraling into chaos.

Official reveals how Tesla CEO helped to track driver

Trump, Tesla, and Tower

The sequence of events leading to the incident

Coincident or planned?

Police behind the investigation of the explosion of a Tesla Cybertruck outside the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas expressed gratitude towards CEO Elon Musk on Wednesday citing the strong construction of the vehicle body that limited the explosion. Police noted that the attack could have been worse but the vehicle limited the blast and its damage.Speaking to CNN, Kevin McMahill, sheriff of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, said that the structural design of the Cybertruck helped contain the damage in the hotel valet area, directing the explosion's force upwards and preserving the building's front glass windows.""The fact that this was a Cybertruck really limited the damage that occurred inside of the valet because it had most of the blast. Up through the truck and out,"" he said.""You'll see that the front glass doors at the Trump Hotel were not even broken by that blast which they were parked directly in front of,"" he added.He further elaborated on how the Tesla Motors’ CEO helped the police to track the driver.""I have to thank Elon Musk specifically,"" McMahill expressed gratitude towards Tesla's CEO, saying that Elon Musk provided ""additional information"", including surveillance footage from charging stations to assist in tracking the suspect.""We have now confirmed that the explosion was caused by very large fireworks and/or a bomb carried in the bed of the rented Cybertruck and is unrelated to the vehicle itself,"" Musk said in a post on X.Musk further clarified that ""All vehicle telemetry was positive at the time of the explosion,"" referring to Tesla's data collection system that monitors vehicle performance metrics, including mileage and travel distance.""It’s a Tesla truck, and we know that Elon Musk is working with President-elect Trump, and it’s the Trump tower,"" McMahill said. ""So, there’s obviously things to be concerned about there, and that’s something we continue to look at.”The Cybertruck, rented in Colorado, made its way to Las Vegas, arriving at 7.30 am on Wednesday, according to McMahill. Following an hour of driving along Las Vegas Boulevard, the vehicle reached the Trump Hotel where it detonated, according to officials.The official said that surveillance recordings showed the driver passing the Trump Hotel approximately an hour before the explosion, later returning to stop in front of the building moments before the blast.Police-released CCTV footage captured the explosion incident. Additional social media videos showed the vehicle covered in smoke whilst being extinguished with water. Police officials presented footage during a press conference showing charred petrol containers and firework mortars discovered in the remains of the severely burnt vehicle.Several law enforcement officials involved in the investigation indicated that the driver likely had military experience.Although authorities have identified who rented the vehicle, they are withholding the driver's name pending identification.The incident occurred shortly after a tragic event in New Orleans, where a pickup truck ploughed into New Year's revellers on Bourbon Street early Wednesday, causing at least 15 fatalities and numerous injuries. According to local and federal authorities, the driver possessed potential improvised explosive devices and an ISIS flag in the vehicle.Turo, an online vehicle-sharing platform, confirmed its service was used to rent vehicles involved in both the New Orleans and Las Vegas incidents, and stated it is assisting authorities.""We do not believe that either renter involved in the Las Vegas and New Orleans attacks had a criminal background that would have identified them as a security threat,"" a Turo spokesperson told CNN.McMahill said the shared rental platform for both incidents was merely a ""coincidence,"" and investigations are ongoing. ""We are absolutely investigating any connectivity to what happened in New Orleans as well as other attacks that have been occurring around the world,"" McMahill said.",Tesla Cybertruck exploded outside the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas on Wednesday.

"Bernie Sanders criticizes Elon Musk over H-1B Visa program, Indian-American doctors, techies fire back",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/bernie-sanders-criticizes-elon-musk-over-h-1b-visa-program-indian-american-cardiologist-fires-back/articleshow/116898612.cms,"Senator Bernie Sanders publicly criticized Elon Musk's defense of the H-1B visa program.

Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has publicly criticized Elon Musk 's defense of the H-1B visa program , reigniting a debate over its impact on the US job market. In a statement released Thursday, Sanders took issue with Musk’s support for the foreign visa system, arguing that it enables companies to hire low-wage foreign workers instead of providing well-paying jobs for Americans.“Elon Musk is wrong,” Sanders wrote in a post on Musk's platform, X. “The main function of the H-1B visa program is not to hire ‘the best and the brightest,’ but rather to replace good-paying American jobs with low-wage indentured servants from abroad. The cheaper the labor they hire, the more money the billionaires make.”This bold assertion drew a sharp response from Anil, an Indian-American cardiologist trained at the Mayo Clinic, who shared his personal experience to counter Sanders' claims. “Senator, I am a cardiologist trained at Mayo Clinic. Without the H-1B visa, my path to US citizenship would have been impossible,” Anil wrote. “Before hiring me, my employer struggled for over a year to find a qualified, well-trained cardiologist to serve rural Kansas. I’d be happy to meet with you to provide a clearer picture of how the H-1B program supports underserved communities and strengthens our nation.”Another user wrote, “The H-1B program can indeed be misused, but it’s essential for addressing skill shortages in the US The real issue isn’t the program itself but ensuring fair wages and treatment for all workers.”Musk, who has long been a vocal supporter of the H-1B program, has argued that there is a shortage of skilled tech workers in the US and that foreign talent is necessary to fill the gaps. He has aligned himself with former President Donald Trump on the issue, with both men advocating for the hiring of individuals from countries like India to boost technological innovation in the US.Sanders, however, remained critical of Musk’s stance, citing recent layoffs at Tesla as evidence that the reliance on foreign guest workers may be harming American workers. “If there is really a shortage of skilled tech workers in America, why did Tesla lay off over 7,500 American workers this year— including many software developers and engineers at its factory in Austin, Texas—while being approved to employ thousands of H-1B guest workers?” Sanders questioned.The Vermont senator, known for his progressive views on labor rights, also used the debate to highlight his proposed minimum wage increase , which remains at $7.25 per hour. Sanders argued that the issue of foreign labor should not overshadow the need for higher wages for American workers. “Bottom line,” he wrote, “It should never be cheaper for a corporation to hire a guest worker from overseas than an American worker.”While Sanders and Musk continue to spar over the future of the H-1B visa program, the debate has also drawn attention to the role of Indian professionals in the US labor force. Many Indian-American workers , especially in the tech and healthcare sectors, rely on the H-1B visa to pursue careers in the US and contribute to the economy.As the conversation around the H-1B visa intensifies, both sides of the debate remain at odds over the program's impact on American jobs and wages. For now, the question remains whether the program’s benefits to the US economy and underserved communities outweigh the concerns voiced by critics like Sanders.","Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has publicly criticized Elon Musk's defense of the H-1B visa program.

Apple agrees to pay $95 million to settle lawsuit accusing Siri of eavesdropping,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/apple-agrees-to-pay-95-million-to-settle-lawsuit-accusing-siri-of-eavesdropping/articleshow/116930090.cms,"Apple has agreed to pay $95 million to settle a lawsuit accusing the privacy-minded company of deploying virtual assistant Siri to eavesdrop on people using its iPhone and other trendy devices.The proposed settlement filed Tuesday in a Oakland, California, federal court would resolve a 5-year-old lawsuit revolving around allegations that Apple surreptitiously activated Siri to record conversations through iPhones and other devices equipped with the virtual assistant for more than a decade.The alleged recordings occurred even when people didn't seek to activate the virtual assistant with the trigger words, ""Hey, Siri"". Some of the recorded conversations were then shared with advertisers in an attempt to sell their products, the lawsuit asserted.The claims about a snoopy Siri contradicted Apple's long-running commitment to protect privacy of its customers.Apple isn't acknowledging any wrongdoing in the settlement, which still must be approved by US district judge Jeffrey White. Lawyers in the case have proposed scheduling a Feb 14 court hearing in Oakland to review the terms.If the settlement is approved, tens of millions of consumers who owned iPhones and other Apple devices from Sept. 17, 2014, through the end of last year could file claims. Each consumer could get up to $20 per Siri-equipped device covered by the settlement, although the payment could be reduced or increased, depending on the volume of claims. Only 3% to 5% of eligible consumers are expected to file claims, according to estimates. Eligible consumers will be limited to seeking compensation on a maximum of five devices.The settlement represents a sliver of the $705 billion in profits that Apple has pocketed since Sept 2014. It's also a fraction of the roughly $1.5 billion that the lawyers representing consumers had estimated Apple could been required to pay if the firm had been found of violating wiretapping.","Settlement would resolve a 5-year-old lawsuit revolving around allegations that Apple surreptitiously activated Siri to record conversations through iPhones and other devices equipped with the virtual assistant.

"From an army veteran to an IS follower, probe focus is on path to radicalisation",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/from-an-army-veteran-to-an-is-follower-probe-focus-is-on-path-to-radicalisation/articleshow/116930073.cms,"WASHINGTON: As investigators learn more about the man who pledged allegiance to Islamic State and killed 14 people with a truck on New Year Day in New Orleans, a key question remains: How did a veteran and one-time employee of a major corporation become radicalised?FBI deputy assistant director Christopher Raia said Thursday that videos made by Shamsud-Din Jabbar just before the attack showed the 42-year-old Texas native supported IS, claimed to have joined the militant group before last summer and believed in a ""war between the believers and nonbelievers"". While FBI was looking into his ""path to radicalisation "", evidence collected since the attack showed that Jabbar was ""100% inspired by ISIS"", said Raia, using an acronym for Islamic State. Jabbar, who authorities said acted alone, was killed in a shootout with police.His half-brother, Abdur Jabbar, said that Jabbar, who had worked for audit firm Deloitte, abandoned Islam in his 20s or 30s, but had recently renewed his faith. He told Reuters in Beaumont, Texas, where Jabbar was born and raised, that he had no idea when his half-brother became radicalised.Ali Soufan, an ex-FBI agent who is on an advisory council to homeland security secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, said Jabbar did not fit the typical profile of those radicalised by IS. Jabbar served for 10 years in the US army and was in his 40s, Soufan noted, explaining that people who fall prey are typically much younger. ""This is a guy who ... went from being a patriot to being an IS terrorist.""It is still unclear what contact Jabbar might have had with overseas extremist groups. A US govt official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Jabbar travelled to Egypt in 2023, staying in Cairo for a week, before returning to the US and then travelling to Toronto for 3 days. It wasn't clear what he did during those travels.US officials and other experts say IS conducts most of its recruiting in online chatrooms and over encrypted communications apps. Recruits could either receive direct orders or self-radicalise to take action. US officials say IS has used the deaths of tens of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza war to boost its recruitment. By inspiring individuals to carry out attacks independently, the IS aims to create an atmosphere of fear and instability, demonstrating its global influence despite lacking a physical caliphate.Attackers responsible for a range of deadly strikes have claimed a link to IS. They included the lone survivor of the Islamist squad that killed 130 people across Paris in 2015, the man who killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in Florida in 2016, and the man who drove a truck into a crowded bike path in 2017 in New York City, killing eight. Some attacks, like those in 2015 in Paris, were carried out by trained IS operatives. But investigators found no proof of a direct role for the terrorist group in others.

Biden rejects Nippon Steel's proposal to acquire US Steel,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/biden-rejects-nippon-steels-proposal-to-acquire-us-steel/articleshow/116930052.cms,"WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden has blocked the nearly $15 billion proposed deal for Nippon Steel of Japan to purchase Pittsburgh-based US Steel - affirming his earlier vow on the presidential campaign trail to prevent the acquisition of Steeltown USA's most storied steel company. ""We need major US companies representing the major share of US steelmaking capacity to keep leading the fight on behalf of America's national interests,"" Biden said.Nippon Steel and US Steel blasted the decision, saying in a joint statement that Biden's blocking the deal ""reflects a clear violation of due process and the law"" in a process it said was ""manipulated"" to advance Biden's political agenda. It also insisted that Biden cited no credible evidence of the deal presenting a national security problem and suggested it will sue, saying ""we are left with no choice but to take all appropriate action to protect our legal rights.""The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States spent months reviewing the deal for national security risks but referred the decision to Biden in Dec, after failing to reach consensus. The move comes just weeks before the Democratic president is set to leave office and could damage ties between the US and Japan - America's biggest ally in Asia and its largest foreign holder of US debt.Nippon Steel announced in Dec 2023 that it planned to buy the steel producer for $14.9 billion in cash and debt, and committed to keep the US Steel name and PittsburghHQ. Despite that, its proposal raised concerns about what the transaction could mean for unionised workers, supply chains and US national security. On Friday, Steelworkers president David McCall called Biden's decision the ""right move for our members"".The announcement came during a tide of renewed support for rebuilding US manufacturing sector and followed a long stretch of protectionist tariffs that analysts say have helped reinvigorate domestic steel.","Nippon Steel and US Steel blasted the decision, saying Biden's blocking the deal ""reflects a clear violation of due process and the law"" It also insisted that Biden cited no credible evidence of the deal presenting a national security problem and suggested it will sue.

US surgeon general urges cancer warnings for alcoholic drinks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-surgeon-general-urges-cancer-warnings-for-alcoholic-drinks/articleshow/116930032.cms,"Alcohol is a leading preventable cause of cancer, and alcoholic beverages should carry a warning label as packs of cigarettes do, the US surgeon general, Dr Vivek Murthy, said on Friday.It is the latest salvo in a fierce debate about the risks and benefits of moderate drinking as the influential US Dietary Guidelines for Americans are about to be updated. For decades, moderate drinking was said to help prevent heart attacks and strokes. That perception has been embedded in the dietary advice given to Americans. But growing research has linked drinking, sometimes even within the recommended limits, to various types of cancer.Labels currently affixed to bottles and cans of alcoholic beverages warn about drinking while pregnant or before driving and operating other machinery, and about general ""health risks.""But alcohol directly contributes to 100,000 cancer cases and 20,000 related deaths each year, Murthy said. He called for updating the labels to include a heightened risk of breast cancer, colon cancer and at least five other malignancies now linked by scientific studies to alcohol consumption.""Many people out there assume that as long as they're drinking at the limits or below the limits of current guidelines of one a day for women and two for men, that there is no risk to their health or well-being,"" Murthy said in an interview. ""The data does not bear that out for cancer risk.""Only Congress can mandate new warning labels of the sort Murthy recommended, and it's not clear that the incoming administration would support the change. Still, President-elect Donald Trump does not drink, and his choice to head the health and human services department, Robert F Kennedy Jr, swore off alcohol and drugs decades ago.There is no question that heavy consumption is harmful. But supporters of moderate drinking - including makers of wine, beer and spirits, and some physicians and scientists - argue that a little alcohol each day may reduce cardiovascular disease, the No. 1 killer in the US. Newer scientific studies have criticised the methodology of earlier studies, however, and have challenged that view, which was once a consensus.While most cancer deaths occur at drinking levels that exceed the current recommended dietary guidelines, the risk for cancers of the breast, the mouth and the throat may rise with consumption of as little as one drink a day, or even less, Murthy said on Friday.Overall, 1 of every 6 breast cancer cases is attributable to alcohol consumption, Murthy said. More recent studies have also linked moderate alcohol consumption to certain forms of heart disease, including atrial fibrillation, a heart arrhythmia. Two scientific reviews will be used to inform the updated recommendations about alcohol consumption in the federal dietary guidelines.Five years ago, the scientific report that informed the writing of the 2020-25 dietary guidelines acknowledged that alcohol is a carcinogen and generally unhealthy and suggested ""tightening guidelines"" by capping the recommendation for men at one standard drink, or 14 grams of alcohol a day. When the final guidelines were drafted, however, there was no change in the advice that moderate drinking of up to two drinks a day for men was acceptable.But the govt acknowledged emerging evidence indicating that ""even drinking within the recommended limits may increase the overall risk of death from various causes, such as from several types of cancer and some forms of cardiovascular disease."" Since then, even more studies have linked alcoholic beverages to cancer.Yet any attempt to change the warning labels on alcoholic beverages is likely to face an uphill battle. The current warning label has not been changed since it was adopted in 1988, even though the link between alcohol and breast cancer has been known for decades.The WHO says there is no safe limit for alcohol consumption, however, and 47 nations require warnings on alcoholic beverages. But cancer is rarely mentioned. nyt","Alcohol directly contributes to 100,000 cancer cases and 20,000 related deaths each year, Dr Vivek Murthy says.

'Trump will continue fighting against these hoaxes'

The hush-money case

Trump's other federal cases

US President-elect Donald Trump will be sentenced on January 10 for his hush-money case, a New York judge ruled Friday. Judge Juan M Merchan indicated Trump would likely receive an unconditional discharge, meaning no jail time, fine, or probation.The sentencing date comes shortly before Trump's planned return to the White House on January 20. Trump can attend the sentencing virtually.The judge rejected Trump's arguments for dismissal based on presidential immunity and his upcoming second term. Merchan said concluding the case served the interests of justice, balancing Trump's ability to govern with the Supreme Court's ruling on presidential immunity, public expectations of equal application of the law, and respect for the jury's verdict. ""This court is simply not persuaded that the first factor outweighs the others at this stage of the proceeding,"" Merchan wrote.Trump's lawyers argued the case would disrupt his presidency, while prosecutors suggested options like freezing the case or a guaranteed no-jail sentence. The judge ruled Trump's status as president-elect doesn't grant him the same immunity as a sitting president, and dismissing the case would undermine the rule of law.Trump faces a maximum potential sentence of four years in prison, though that outcome is unlikely given the judge's indication. The sentencing was initially scheduled for July but has been postponed twice.Steven Cheung, Trump's communications director, said that the order issued by Acting Justice Merchan in the Manhattan DA's case, which he described as a ""witch hunt,"" was a direct violation of the Supreme Court's immunity decision and other longstanding jurisprudence. He added that the case should be dismissed.""Today's order by the deeply conflicted, Acting Justice Merchan in the Manhattan DA Witch Hunt is a direct violation of the Supreme Court's Immunity decision and other longstanding jurisprudence. This lawless case should have never been brought and the Constitution demands that it be immediately dismissed,"" Cheung said in his statement on social media platform X.Cheung stressed that Trump must be allowed to continue the presidential transition process and that there should be no sentencing.""President Trump must be allowed to continue the Presidential Transition process and to execute the vital duties of the presidency, unobstructed by the remains of this or any remnants of the Witch Hunts. There should be no sentencing, and President Trump will continue fighting against these hoaxes until they are all dead,"" Cheung added.Trump was convicted in May on 34 counts of falsifying business records related to a hush-money payment made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels during the 2016 presidential campaign. Trump denies Daniels' allegations and maintains his innocence.This conviction makes Trump the first former president convicted of a crime and the first convicted individual elected president.The case revolves around how Trump reimbursed his then-lawyer, Michael Cohen, for the payment to Daniels. Cohen called the judge’s decision “judicious and appropriate.”Trump’s legal team previously attempted to overturn the conviction based on a Supreme Court immunity decision and sought to move the case to federal court, but both efforts were unsuccessful.This case is the only one of Trump's four criminal indictments to reach trial. Two federal cases, one related to the 2020 election and the other to classified documents, have been dismissed by special counsel Jack Smith. A state election interference case in Georgia is currently on hold. Trump's lawyers argued the dismissal of the federal cases warranted dismissal of the New York hush-money case, but Judge Merchan disagreed, saying that the hush-money case was in a “vastly” different stage.","US President-elect Donald Trump will be sentenced on January 10 for his hush- money case.

As Kamala Harris swore Bernie Sanders in at the Senate Friday, her chitchat with the Independent senator caught social media's attention. ""Stand right here. Although that is not your nature to just stand where you're told to stand, but give it a try,"" Kamala Harris said before administering the oath. And then the two politicians shook hands and greeted each other.As the Vice President, it was Kamala Harris's duty to swear in the new senators as the 119th Congress convened on Friday. The swearing-in event was anticipated to have thrown up some awkward moments as the election was acrimonious and Republican leaders even mispronounced Kamaal Harris's name during the campaign.But on the Senate floor, it was business as usual with Kamala Harris back to her job after a long hiatus after the crushing election defeat. She was in her jovial mood, smilingly interacting with the senators. While administering the Pledge of Allegiance, she however fumbled and omitted the 'flag' drawing major flak on social media. Republican supporters asked how could she not remember the Pledge of Allegiance which was read every day in school.Bernie Sanders, the Independent senator from Vermont endorsed Kamala Harris during the campaigning and gave an address at the Democratic National Convention. “We need an economy that works for all of us, not just the greed of the billionaire class.

""While the Democratic leadership defends the status quo, the American people are angry and want change. And they're right.""","As the Vice President, it was Kamala Harris's duty to swear in the new senators as the 119th Congress convened on Friday.

The deadly attack had sparked further violence and road closures in the district, restricting access to medicine, food and fuel in the area as casualties in fighting between Sunni and Shia tribes surged to 136. The conflict had forced the closing of the only road connecting Parachinar, Kurram’s headquarters, with the provincial capital of Peshawar.“Travel and security arrangements are being made for the convoy (of passengers) leaving on Saturday,” Pakistan govt spokesperson Muhammad Ali Saif said on Friday, warning that any armed aggression would be prosecuted as terrorism.The KP administration had recently formed a grand jirga, or council of political and tribal elders, which reached a peace deal between the warring Shia and Sunni tribes on Wednesday following weeks of negotiations. Under the peace agreement, both sides have agreed on the demolition of bunkers and the handover of heavy weapons to the authorities.“Both sides will give a coordinated plan of action within 15 days for the collection of weapons,” Saif said, adding that bunkers already existing in the area will be dismantled within a month.After the demolition of bunkers, according to the official, any party that launches an attack will be considered a “terrorist” and action will be taken against it.Another provision of the peace agreement states that anybody who violates the terms of the agreement by employing weapons against the other would face a Pakistani Rs 10 million ($35,933) fine.

The data highlights severe air quality issues in Pakistan, significantly threatening public health.Lahore, home to over 11 million people, continues to grapple with dire air pollution, largely attributed to vehicle emissions, industrial activities, and crop burning, The Express Tribune reported.The smog crisis has led to widespread respiratory ailments, with recent figures revealing over 1.8 million individuals have fallen ill in the past month due to smog-related issues. Of these, approximately 1,29,229 have required hospital treatment for respiratory conditions, while 61,00,153 have been diagnosed with cardiothoracic conditions, underscoring the grave health impacts.In Karachi, Pakistan’s largest city and bustling economic hub, the AQI of 164 reflects persistent pollution from heavy traffic, industrial zones, and port activities. Despite initiatives to curb pollution, the city remains in the “unhealthy” category, raising concerns for residents, especially those with pre-existing health conditions.Yasir Hussain, director of the Climate Action Centre (CAC), emphasised the role of vehicular emissions in exacerbating air pollution during a press conference at the Karachi Press Club. He noted that vehicle emissions are responsible for 60 per cent of Karachi’s pollution and 80 per cent of Lahore’s, with both cities experiencing severe environmental and health consequences.The air quality crisis has coincided with a measles outbreak in the region, further straining healthcare systems. Doctors have warned of the disease’s high contagion rate and urged parents to ensure timely vaccinations for children aged between nine months and 1.5 years to prevent fatalities.Lahore’s hazardous air pollution has prompted authorities to consider stricter measures, while experts have highlighted the need for regional cooperation to tackle the transboundary nature of air pollution.","Lahore has been ranked as the world’s most polluted city, with an AQI of 354 classified as “hazardous,” while Karachi is listed 13th with an “Unhealthy” AQI.

Rescue officials confirmed the injuries, which resulted from celebratory gunfire during the early hours of January 1, 2025, ARY News reported.The incidents took place in various areas of Karachi, including Liaquatabad, Tariq Road, Shah Faisal, Orangi Town, Gulshan-e-Iqbal, Azizabad, and Korangi. In Liaquatabad, three people were injured by stray bullets.Tariq Road and Shah Faisal reported incidents where two women sustained injuries due to celebratory firing. Orangi Town and Gulshan-e-Iqbal also witnessed two injuries, while Azizabad saw a child being hurt by a stray bullet.Additional cases of aerial firing were reported in other parts of the city.

A Parsi family that knows all about booze in Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/a-parsi-family-that-knows-all-about-booze-in-pakistan/articleshow/116842907.cms,"In 1947, when the British transferred power to India and Pakistan, many businesses also changed hands. One of them was Murree Brewery , among the oldest distilleries in Asia, which was then largely owned by a British family. The Bhandaras of Lahore became its new owners. They were a Parsi family that had thrived in the liquor business.Isphanyar Bhandara now runs Pakistan's top brewery. He recently made a brief halt in New Delhi on his way to Nepal. ""It's my tenth visit to India,"" the businessman-politician said cheerfully, a Pakistan flag lapel pin on his coat the only green in his otherwise blue attire.Liquor business is heavily regulated in the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. About 96% of the country's population is Muslim. The brewery, accordingly, points out on its website, ""Under the country's laws Pakistan Muslims are prohibited from consuming alcoholic drinks. Non-Muslims and foreigners require a consumption permit.""Nonetheless, the business has been rewarding for the Bhandaras. ""The forbidden fruit is always sweet,"" said Isphanyar. ""We make beers from Australian barley. Our vodkas and single malts are also doing very well. It's all about quality. We also make and export fruit juice and are heavily into (bottled) water,"" he added.Success though hasn't been limited to the arena of trade. Isphanyar is also a member of the Pakistan National Assembly . His father was a central minister under Zia-ul-Haq in the 1980s and an MP during the Pervez Musharraf regime.But, as a community, the Parsis have wilted. In 1947, Isphanyar says, about 20,000-25,000 of them lived in Pakistan. Like in India, they played a major role in nation-building, especially in cities like Karachi. They were among the top businessmen and jurists and were engaged in philanthropic work. In the 19th century, Parsis were also among the early cricketers of Karachi. According to an article in scoreline.org, a team of Parsi cricketers toured England in 1886. In 1952, when Pakistan's cricket team toured India, southpaw batter Rusi Dinshaw was part of the squad, although he didn't get to play a Test.""Today, we are less than 1,000,"" says Isphanyar. ""Most of the Parsi population is in its 80s or 90s, a bit like the Japanese. There are very few young Parsis in Pakistan today,"" he said.Many left due to economic reasons, others due to law and order issues. One such migrant was the renowned writer Bapsi Sidhwa, whose novel, Ice Candy Man, was made into a feature film called 'Earth' by director Deepa Mehta. Sidhwa passed away in Houston on Dec 25 last year; she was Isphanyar's aunt.The 54-year-old businessman gets raw material and machinery from India. ""A lot of companies in Pakistan do. The problem is, it is via Dubai,"" he said. But there are other reasons why he wants more trade between the two neighbours.""We can disagree on Kashmir, put it on the back burner. We don't have to concede our position and India doesn't have to concede theirs. But we should keep the baggage of history aside and look at the common good of the common people. We should open the Wagah border,"" he said.More business will benefit the underprivileged, he believes. ""We need it for the common man - dal, roti, cheeni, stuff like that. It will lower the inflation in Pakistan. I've made my presentations to our Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif saab. I'm keeping my fingers crossed,"" he said.Not many know that the brewery - it gets its name from the scenic resort town - was set up in 1860, just three years after the 1857 revolt, to mainly service British troops. Edward Dyer, father of Reginald Dyer, the perpetrator of the 1919 Jallianwala Bagh massacre, was its first manager. By 1890, water shortage and other logistical issues had forced the distillery to shift to the Rawalpindi area, where it continues to be headquartered.There was a time when Murree Beer was sold in India. ""In fact, Pakistan railways had put up tracks inside the brewery that used to carry beer to places like Kabul, Amritsar and, of course, to Karachi port,"" he said. But the state of politics and, consequently, policies, changed in Pakistan in the late 1970s when, exceptions aside, alcohol was banned. But as reputed Dawn columnist Nadeem Paracha wrote in 2013, ""Despite the violence and the eventual prohibition on the (open) sale of alcohol and bars in Pakistan in April 1977, Pakistanis never did stop drinking.""About two decades back, a possible joint venture project proved abortive. ""In 2006, when Vijay Mallya (former chairman of United Spirits) visited Pakistan to watch a cricket match, the prospect of doing something together was broached with my father. But politics did not allow them to come together,"" he said.Political relations between the two countries have further dipped now. But Isphanyar is an optimist. He wants the situation to improve. And more Indo-Pak trade , he insists, is the way to begin.","In 1947, when the British transferred power to India and Pakistan, many businesses also changed hands.

Inflation has visibly decreased and the collaboration between the government and institutions continues to strengthen,"" he said.The prime minister stressed on the need for reducing the cost of inputs like electricity and gas to ensure sustainable growth. He said local industries should be made more compatible to save foreign exchange and expand exports, emphasising that export-led growth is the only option to make Pakistan a stronger economy.He also highlighted the coalition government's struggle to stabilise the economy during Pakistan's 2023 financial crisis.""When we were on the brink of default and striving for the IMF programme, we decided to prioritise saving the state over politics,"" he said.Praising the collaboration between government institutions, he said, ""I have never seen such a partnership before.

However, during the first five months of FY25, textile exports reached USD 7.607 billion, reflecting a 10.51 per cent increase compared to the same period last year Express Tribune reported.In the first 11 months of 2024, textile exports totaled just USD 15.43 billion. Industry millers anticipate that the December figure could be approximately USD 1.5 billion, resulting in the year ending with exports falling short of USD 17 billion.Ijaz Khokhar, Patron-in-Chief of the Pakistan-textile-exports, stated, ""The early months of this calendar year were relatively good for the textile industry, particularly exports, as they showed a positive trend.""The positive trend started to decline after the initial months. The primary cause was ongoing political instability, which has persisted for more than two years. Khokhar remarked, ""We have lost at least 40 per cent of our export orders because buyers, hesitant to trust Pakisttextile millers due to political challenges, are shifting their orders to Vietnam.""Others noted that Pakistan also missed the chance to secure orders that were diverted from Bangladesh due to its political turmoil. Waqas Hanif, a mid-sized textile miller from Lahore, said, ""Textile millers in Pakistan should have fully taken advantage of the opportunity created by the political change in Bangladesh. However, our millers have been unable to meet the demand because of price differences.""According to the Express Tribune report a significant portion of the demand was once again redirected to Vietnam, as Pakistani millers lacked product diversification. Hanif highlighted, ""Vietnam is far more advanced in the textile and other sectors. They offer a wide range of products and are able to offer lower prices.""Pakistan was once the top choice for international buyers due to its competitive prices. However, the country has consistently struggled with product diversification. Over the past decade, the government, textile millers, analysts, and foreign buyers have all emphasized the need for diversification.While a few millers are making efforts, the industry as a whole remains far from developing the new products required by European Union and American buyers. The government's support in this area has also been lackluster. Some economists caution that ongoing political tensions, along with stringent measures from the finance ministry and the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), could severely harm the sector, which remains the largest source of export revenue.""The local industry has not been growing for years, so how can we expect product diversification or an increase in export revenue?"" asked Ahmad Aziz Subhani, an economist based in the UAE.Recently, the FBR included the textile sector in the standard tax regime, requiring millers to pay a 2 per cent advance tax instead of the previous 1 per cent. Furthermore, they are now obligated to submit all their business information to the FBR.Subhani stated that following the tax increase, many Pakistani textile companies have been relocating to Dubai. ""So far, about 400 companies have set up offices in Dubai and registered with the Dubai Chamber of Commerce. This will likely lead to under-invoicing of export orders by several Pakistani millers, further reducing export revenue,"" he added.The report further stated that many textile industry leaders highlight that the sector is heading in the wrong direction.""We are struggling with high energy costs, which have led to a reduction in mills and a shift of orders to Vietnam. We are uncertain about how many billions of dollars we've lost because of this,"" said Ashraf Ali, a textile retailer based in Faisalabad. He further mentioned that a cotton crisis is looming, as nearly half of the spinning units have shut down due to a liquidity shortage and delays in the FBR's release of sales tax refunds.""We should expect a rise in yarn prices and a shortage of the product in 2025,"" Ali added. The industry is also awaiting the start of Trump's second term, as many factors depend on the policies the incoming US president will implement.Many millers argue that any restrictions, whether due to political instability or other factors, would have a detrimental impact on Pakistan's textile industry. They also pointed out that the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war and the conflict in the Middle East could further escalate tensions and affect the global economy.In summary, textile exports for the current fiscal year are likely to decline or remain flat due to the various challenges the industry is facing. The sector has almost given up on reaching its USD 25 billion export target, as they believe that without a clear textile policy and the active involvement of key stakeholders in decision-making, achieving this goal would remain an unrealistic aspiration. (ANI)","Pakistan's textile industry, which was once poised to achieve higher export earnings, started to lose its momentum. The primary cause was ongoing political instability, which has persisted for more than two years. Pakistan was once the top choice for international buyers due to its competitive prices.

Diplomatic efforts amid rising hostilities

What lies ahead?

Tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan have escalated into deadly clashes at the border, leaving at least eight individuals dead and 13 others, including civilians, injured on the Afghan side. The ongoing conflict, which persisted into late Saturday night, comes amidst the growing strain between the two nations, once considered allies.The violence followed an intense exchange of fire, reportedly triggered by Pakistan's targeted airstrikes on alleged camps of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in Afghanistan's eastern Paktika province earlier in the week. Pakistani security officials claim the strikes were a response to a failed infiltration attempt by militants from Afghanistan.According to Pakistani sources, militants attempting to breach the border on Friday night were repelled by Pakistani forces. The following morning, these militants allegedly joined Afghan forces to launch coordinated attacks on Pakistani border posts using light and heavy weapons. The attacks targeted several areas, including Ghozgarhi, Matha Sangar, Kot Ragha, and Tari Mengal.Pakistani forces retaliated, reportedly inflicting significant losses and forcing the attackers to abandon their posts. However, the violence also claimed the life of one Frontier Corps soldier and left 11 others injured.Pakistan has long accused the Afghan Taliban of harboring TTP militants who have intensified attacks on Pakistani security forces in recent months. These attacks, particularly in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan regions, have heightened security concerns in Islamabad.While urging the Afghan government to take decisive action against the TTP, Pakistan said that dialogue between the two nations could not occur amidst ongoing violence.While these diplomatic calls were failing, tensions flared after Pakistan's airstrikes in the Barmal district of Paktika on December 24, which reportedly killed at least 46 individuals, including women and children. The Taliban's ministry of defense condemned the strikes, describing them as an attack on civilians and vowing retaliation.The airstrikes came on the same day a Pakistani delegation led by Special Representative Muhammad Sadiq met Afghan leaders in Kabul in an attempt to resume diplomatic dialogue after a year-long hiatus. However, the Afghan government lodged a formal protest over the airstrikes, accusing Pakistan of targeting civilians rather than militants.The escalating conflict comes against the backdrop of strained relations following the TTP's termination of a ceasefire with Pakistan in November 2022. Since then, attacks by the TTP have claimed the lives of numerous Pakistani soldiers, further deteriorating ties between the neighbors.The renewed border violence, marked by both airstrikes and ground clashes, shows a growing distrust between Kabul and Islamabad. While Pakistan continues to demand action against the TTP, the Afghan Taliban denies harboring militants and accuses Pakistan of targeting civilians under the guise of counterterrorism operations.","Tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan have escalated into deadly clashes at the border.

GWADAR: The inauguration of the New Gwadar International Airport (NGIA) has been delayed for the third time due to ongoing security concerns in the region.Originally scheduled to begin operations on January 1, 2025, the airport, which is a key part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), will now remain closed indefinitely, the Balochistan Post reported.Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) has also cancelled its first commercial flight, which was set to coincide with the opening, according to reports from The Balochistan Times.The NGIA, a major infrastructure project funded by China at a cost of USD 250 million, is designed to accommodate large aircraft such as the Airbus A380. The airport's original opening date of August 14, 2024, was planned to coincide with Pakistan's Independence Day celebrations but was postponed due to protests organised by the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC).The second delay followed a series of deadly attacks by the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), which targeted key CPEC-related infrastructure, including highways, railway bridges, and mineral transport vehicles, as reported by The Balochistan Post.This latest delay highlights the growing security risks posed by Baloch separatist groups that oppose Chinese investments in the region.The BLA, a major armed group advocating for Baloch independence, has repeatedly targeted Chinese projects and nationals in Pakistan. Notable attacks include a 2018 suicide bombing on a bus carrying Chinese engineers, assaults on the Chinese Consulate in Karachi, and a 2023 attack in Gwadar that killed 13 people, including four Chinese nationals.The BLA has also warned foreign nationals to avoid Balochistan, calling it a ""war zone,"" according to The Balochistan Post.In response to these threats, the Civil Aviation Authority and the Balochistan government have decided to review security arrangements before proceeding with the airport's opening. The BLA's Majeed Brigade has vowed to continue its campaign against Chinese interests, further complicating Pakistan's efforts to maintain stability and attract foreign investment to the region.","The inauguration of the New Gwadar International Airport has been delayed for the third time.

Fazal, a resident of Hirabad area in Kech district, was detained on December 23, and his location remains unidentified, according to The Balochistan Post.His family has sought assistance from human rights organisations to determine his whereabouts, worried about his safety. The persistent issue of enforced disappearances in Balochistan continues to draw attention, with local activists and human rights organisations demanding accountability and the release of missing persons.Despite continuous calls for justice, these incidents highlight the ongoing accusations against Pakistani security forces in the region.The families of Balach and Fazal have requested authorities to investigate their cases and provide information about their missing relatives.Balochistan continues to witness systematic abductions and killings, affecting various segments of society including activists, politicians, journalists and civilians, who are reportedly taken by security forces, according to news agency ANI.The Pakistani military faces frequent accusations of using enforced disappearances as a tactic against insurgents and separatist groups. Human rights organisations and Baloch nationalist groups argue that these abductions aim to suppress opposition.These disappearances often lead to torture and extrajudicial killings, intensifying the human rights situation in the region, the report added.","The boy, identified as Balach, is from the Panjgur district of Balochistan.

May 9 Riots and aftermath

International outcry

Pakistan's response

Pakistan's military courts have sentenced 60 more civilians to prison for their alleged involvement in the violent May 9, 2023, riots that targeted military sites and other facilities following the arrest of former Prime Minister Imran Khan This brings the total number of convictions related to the unrest to 85, according to announcements from the military’s Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).Among those sentenced is Hassan Niazi , Khan’s nephew, who received a 10-year prison term for his alleged role in the attack on the Lahore Corps Commander’s residence, also known as Jinnah House.The ISPR stated that the Field General Court Martial handed down the sentences after reviewing evidence and ensuring due process. “Sequel to the announcement of the May 9 punishments... the Field General Court Martial has promulgated the punishments to the following remaining 60 culprits after examining all evidence, ensuring the provision of all legal rights to the convicts, completion of due process, and the appropriate legal proceedings,” the ISPR announced.The convicted individuals face sentences ranging from two to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment. They have the right to appeal the decisions under Pakistan's Constitution.The unrest on May 9 erupted after Imran Khan’s arrest in a corruption case. Supporters of Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party allegedly attacked key military installations, including the Army General Headquarters in Rawalpindi, the Corps Commander’s House in Lahore, and an ISI office in Faisalabad.In response, authorities detained hundreds of individuals, and 103 were handed over to military courts for trial, sparking widespread criticism of the opaque judicial process.The convictions have drawn sharp rebukes from international entities, including the United States, United Kingdom, and the European Union. Critics argue that the use of military courts to try civilians undermines judicial independence and transparency.“These military courts lack judicial independence, transparency, and due process guarantees,” the US State Department said. Similarly, the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth, and Development Office (FCO) criticized the lack of transparency and independent oversight in the trials, emphasizing the importance of adhering to fair trial standards under international law.The European Union also expressed concern, highlighting that Pakistan’s actions contradict its obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and commitments tied to the GSP+ trade program.The Pakistani government has defended the use of military courts, citing the Supreme Court’s decision that allowed the military to proceed with trials of civilians involved in the riots. The Foreign Office reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to international human rights obligations, asserting that the trials were conducted in accordance with national laws.The ISPR emphasized that the convictions reflect the military’s resolve to uphold justice and maintain the authority of the state, stating, “The Nation, Government, and Armed Forces remain steadfast in their commitment to upholding justice and ensuring that the inviolable writ of the state is maintained.”","Pakistan's military courts have sentenced 60 more civilians to prison for their alleged involvement in the violent May 9, 2023, riots.

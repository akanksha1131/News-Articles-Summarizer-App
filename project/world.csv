BANGKOK: Myanmar's military has shut down a major online scam operation near the border with Thailand, detaining more than 2,000 people and seizing dozens of Starlink satellite internet terminals, state media reported Monday.Myanmar is notorious for hosting cyberscam operations responsible for bilking people all over the world. These usually involve gaining victims' confidence online with romantic ploys and bogus investment pitches.The centers are infamous for recruiting workers from other countries under false pretenses, promising them legitimate jobs and then holding them captive and forcing them to carry out criminal activities.Scam operations were in the international spotlight last week when the United States and Britain enacted sanctions against organisers of a major Cambodian cyberscam gang, and its alleged ringleader was indicted by a federal court in New York.According to a report in Monday's Myanma Alinn newspaper, the army raided KK Park, a well-documented cybercrime center, as part of operations starting in early September to suppress online fraud, illegal gambling, and cross-border cybercrime.It published photos displaying seized Starlink equipment and soldiers said to be carrying out the raid, though it was unclear when exactly they were taken. KK Park is located on the outskirts of Myawaddy, a major trading town on the border with Thailand in Myanmar's Kayin state. The area is only loosely under the control of Myanmar's military government, and also falls under the influence of ethnic minority militias.Maj. Gen. Zaw Min Tun, the spokesperson for the military government, charged in a statement Monday night that the top leaders of the Karen National Union, an armed ethnic organisation opposed to army rule, were involved in the scam projects at KK Park.The allegation was previously made based on claims that a company backed by the Karen group allowed the land to be leased. However, the Karen, who are part of the larger armed resistance movement in Myanmar's civil war, deny any involvement in the scams.Myanma Alinn said the army ascertained that more than 260 buildings were unregistered, and seized equipment, including 30 sets of Starlink satellite internet terminals. It said 2,198 individuals were detained though it did not give their nationalities.Starlink is part of Elon Musk 's SpaceX company and the terminals link to its satellites. It does not have licensed operations in Myanmar, but at least hundreds of terminals have been smuggled into the Southeast Asian nation.The company could not be immediately reached for comment Monday but its policy bans ""conduct that is defamatory, fraudulent, obscene, or deceptive.""There have been previous crackdowns on cyberscam operations in Myanmar earlier this year and in 2023.Facing pressure from China, Thailand and Myanmar's governments launched an operation in February in which they released thousands of trafficked people from scam compounds, working with the ethnic armed groups that rule Myanmar's border areas.","Myanmar is notorious for hosting cyberscam operations responsible for bilking people all over the world.

Explained: Why a US appeals court may revisit Donald Trump’s Portland troop ruling,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/explained-why-a-us-appeals-court-may-revisit-donald-trumps-portland-troop-ruling/articleshow/124711996.cms,"Trump wins court battle to deploy Oregon National Guard, raising alarm over presidential power limits/Image: AP

Driving the news



Why it matters





The legal battle so far

The politics and stakes

The big picture





A federal appeals court decision that handed Donald Trump a legal victory on deploying the Oregon National Guard to Portland is now under threat — as a judge calls for a rare full-court review that could overturn it.On Monday, a three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 that Trump has the authority to federalise Oregon’s National Guard and deploy them to Portland to “protect federal property”. The decision lifted a lower-court injunction that had blocked the move.But within hours, another Ninth Circuit judge formally requested a “vote on whether the case should be reheard” — a process known as an en banc review. That means all 29 active judges on the country’s largest appellate court will now vote on whether to reconsider the case. If they do, a new panel of 11 judges (including the chief judge) will rehear arguments.The outcome will shape the limits of presidential power over state militias — a constitutional faultline not tested in decades. If the panel’s decision stands, Trump could retain control over Oregon’s National Guard and potentially deploy them with minimal justification.Critics warn that it would hand the executive branch sweeping powers to override state authority and suppress protests under the guise of law enforcement.The initial block: District Judge Karin Immergut (a Trump appointee) halted the deployment, calling Trump’s claims of a “rebellion” in Portland “untethered to the facts”. Portland, she noted, had seen only small demonstrations outside an ICE office.Circumvention attempt: After that ruling, Trump tried to deploy federalised California National Guard troops into Oregon — prompting Immergut to issue a second order banning any such deployment.The appeal: Two Trump-appointed appellate judges, Ryan Nelson and Bridget Bade, overturned Immergut’s orders, saying the president likely acted within his statutory powers to federalise the Guard when “unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.”The dissent: Judge Susan Graber, a Clinton appointee, issued a scathing dissent, calling the decision “absurd” and a threat to core constitutional principles. She mocked government claims that Portland was a “war zone”, noting protesters often wore “chicken suits, inflatable frog costumes, or nothing at all.”Oregon officials have united against the ruling.Governor Tina Kotek urged Trump to “send all the National Guard members home” and said there is no insurrection or public safety crisis.Attorney General Dan Rayfield warned that if the decision stands, the president would have “unilateral power to put Oregon soldiers on our streets with almost no justification.”The Ninth Circuit’s ideological makeup could now determine the outcome: 16 of its 29 active judges were appointed by Democratic presidents, 13 by Republicans. If the full court agrees to rehear the case, the dynamics could shift dramatically.This is one of the most significant tests in decades of federal authority versus state sovereignty.The case could set a precedent on how broadly a president can interpret “rebellion” or “lawlessness” to justify deploying state troops.It’s also a bellwether for Trump’s second-term strategy of using federalised state forces to police dissent — a tactic that many legal experts say risks eroding civil liberties and the balance of power between Washington and the states.For now, Trump retains control over Oregon’s National Guard — but whether he can actually put boots on Portland’s streets will depend on how the Ninth Circuit’s next move plays out. A decision on whether to rehear the case is expected after both sides submit briefs by Wednesday midnight.","A three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 that Trump has the authority to federalise Oregon’s National Guard and deploy them to Portland.

'Keep fighting'







LIMA: Peru's Generation Z is leading protests against rampant crime and years of political deadlock, demanding systemic change after watching seven presidents come and go in a decade.Peruvian politics is not for the faint of heart.The country has suffered years of near-constant political crisis, corruption scandals, rising prices and deadly protests.Presidents have been impeached, charged, and forced from office. There is even a specially built jail that still houses three of them.But now a new generation of Peruvians, born since Alberto Fujimori's dictatorship ended in 2000, are now leading the calls for change.In recent days, thousands of young people have filled Lima's streets.They organise through social media and, like youth from Indonesia, Nepal and Madagascar, wave Japanese manga ""One Piece"" pirate flags while voicing their demands.In Lima, their anger erupted on October 15, when clashes with police left one person dead and about 100 injured.""This is about fighting for a future,"" Angelo Nael Genti told AFP.The 19-year-old student was beaten and hospitalised after being hit by a pellet during the crackdown.Most demonstrators are under 28 and many from poor neighborhoods.They say they feel unprotected by a state they accuse of failing to curb crime or deliver stability.Genti joined classmates from a public university for what he called a peaceful march.""They threatened me. They told me if they hadn't arrested me, they would have killed me right there,"" he said, showing bruises on his arm and head injuries.He recalls first feeling the impact of a pellet on his left leg before falling to the ground. ""About seven police officers beat and kicked me,"" he said.Videos of police aggression went viral on social media, amplifying outrage.Despite fear, Genti vows to keep protesting: ""We want to preserve this idea of struggle for the next generations.""His mother calls him a hero for fighting for Peruvians' rights.Genti hopes to finish his cultural heritage studies and possibly pursue filmmaking.The protests have no single leader but share common demands: an end to corruption, better security and jobs in a country where informal work is widespread.A constant struggle for power between lawmakers and Peru's parade of presidents has made crisis the rule, and made reforms all but impossible.Rosalinda, a 26-year-old law graduate, says she marches to ""expel criminals from power.""From a poor Lima district, she has worked and studied to survive.""Generation Z is more of a cliche,"" she said. ""I consider myself part of the working people.""She accompanied young detainees after police arrested about 20 protesters that day.All were later released for lack of legal grounds.AFP heard shouts from inside the detention center before their release: ""Let me out.""Despite fear, Rosalinda says she will keep marching: ""If I don't come back, keep fighting,"" she tells her family.Wildalr Lozano, 20, a cricket player on Peru's national team, says he joined because he feels ""unprotected"" and disconnected from the government.The movement, he adds, is about more than politics: ""I've been robbed twice, and I live in a supposedly safe district.""For many, the 'One Piece' flag symbolises unity against corrupt regimes.The manga series, which has sold hundreds of millions of copies globally, pits a band of pirates against an authoritarian global government.",Peru's Generation Z is leading protests against rampant crime and years of political deadlock.

The Trump administration announced on Saturday that two survivors from a drug-smuggling submarine destroyed in the Caribbean will be sent back to their home countries, Ecuador and Colombia, for detention and prosecution. Two others were killed during the strike.US President Donald Trump confirmed the action on Truth Social, saying, ""It was my great honor to destroy a very large DRUG-CARRYING SUBMARINE that was navigating towards the United States on a well-known narcotrafficking transit route. U.S. Intelligence confirmed this vessel was loaded up with mostly Fentanyl, and other illegal narcotics. There were four known narcoterrorists on board the vessel. Two of the terrorists were killed. At least 25,000 Americans would die if I allowed this submarine to come ashore. The two surviving terrorists are being returned to their Countries of origin, Ecuador and Colombia, for detention and prosecution. No U.S. Forces were harmed in this strike. Under my watch, the United States of America will not tolerate narcoterrorists trafficking illegal drugs, by land or by sea. Thank you for your attention to this matter!""The strike took place on Thursday following a series of attacks on vessels suspected of carrying drugs.The semi-submersible submarine was intercepted after multiple previous strikes involving speedboats had killed 27 people. US Navy officials rescued the two survivors and detained them aboard a warship in international waters, marking the first time the military has held prisoners as part of Trump’s campaign against suspected drug traffickers.Trump described the attack during a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, adding, ""We attacked a submarine and that was a drug-carrying submarine built specifically for the transportation of massive amounts of drugs. Just so you understand, this was not an innocent group of people. I don’t know too many people that have submarines.""Since early September, the Trump administration has increased military operations in the Caribbean targeting drug smugglers.","Two survivors from a drug-smuggling submarine destroyed in the Caribbean will be sent back to their home countries, Ecuador and Colombia, for detention and prosecution.

Dozens of journalists walked out of the Pentagon on Wednesday rather than agree to new MAGA rules limiting their reporting.This led to many condemnations, including that of Indian-origin Congressman Suhas Subramanyam, who called the restrictions an attack on press freedom and slammed US defence secretary Pete HegsethSubramanyam posted his official statement on X, “My statement on the Administration's attacks on the First Amendment and the Pentagon Press Corps.” He also said, “Make no mistake, Secretary Hegseth's attempts to restrict reporters are an attack on freedom of the press, the First Amendment, and our democracy. The American people deserve transparency through accurate and fair reporting. Rather than attacking the messengers of his failed policies, Secretary Hegseth should instead consider doing more to support servicemembers and their families and keep our country safe.”The walkout followed new rules imposed by Hegseth that would allow the Pentagon to expel journalists for reporting on information that had not been approved for release. News organisations rejected the rules, calling them a threat to independent reporting. They see the rules as a way to spoon-feed information and control the narrative.Reporters began leaving; they carried chairs, documents, copying machines, books, and old photos to the parking lot as they handed in their badges.Around 40 to 50 journalists left the Pentagon together, reports the Associated Press.Hegseth has previously limited access to many areas of the Pentagon, held only two formal press briefings, and launched investigations into leaks to the media. He described the new rules as “common sense.""US President Donald Trump backed the new policy, telling reporters at the White House on Tuesday, “I think he finds the press to be very disruptive in terms of world peace. The press is very dishonest.”Several reporters posted on social media when they turned in their badges. Heather Mongilio of USNINews wrote, “It’s such a tiny thing, but I was really proud to see my picture up on the wall of Pentagon correspondents. Today, I’ll hand in my badge. The reporting will continue.”NPR reporter Tom Bowman noted that sources will continue to provide crucial information. “With no reporters able to ask questions, it seems the Pentagon leadership will continue to rely on slick social media posts, carefully orchestrated short videos and interviews with partisan commentators and podcasters. No one should think that’s good enough,” he said.The Pentagon Press Association, representing 101 reporters from 56 news outlets, opposed the rules. Most organisations instructed their reporters to leave rather than submit.","Dozens of journalists walked out of the Pentagon on Wednesday rather than agree to new MAGA rules limiting their reporting.

A cargo plane arriving from Dubai skidded off the runway and plunged into the sea at Hong Kong International Airport early Monday, colliding with a ground-service vehicle and killing two workers.The accident took place at approximately 3.53 am when Emirates SkyCargo flight EK9788, operated by Turkish carrier Air ACT, touched down on the north runway 07R after departing from Al Maktoum International Airport (DWC) in Dubai, Hong Kong standard reported.The aircraft, a Boeing 747-481 (BDSF) registered TC-ACF, reportedly swerved left during its landing roll before partially submerging into the sea adjacent to the runway.According to sources, the freighter collided with a ground-service vehicle during landing, tearing off one of its wheels and causing substantial damage.Two male staff members in the vehicle were ejected into the sea. Firefighters recovered both men around 5am—the driver was transported unconscious to North Lantau Hospital, where he was later pronounced dead, while the passenger died at the scene.The four crew members aboard the freighter were unharmed.

Economic goals



Who will benefit/suffer



Public reception







Poland’s president, Karol Nawrocki, has approved a new law that removes personal income tax for parents raising at least two children.The move is aimed at supporting families, boosting household income, and stimulating the economy.The bill was presented in August. It removes the income tax obligation for families earning up to 140,000 zloty (€32,973) per year. It applies to all parents with legal responsibility for children, including legal guardians and foster parents.According to calculations by the presidency, an average Polish family is expected to be around 1,000 zloty (€235) better off each month due to the new tax relief. However, the full impact of the law will only be visible in the 2026 tax return, which will be filed in 2027.The reform is part of a broader effort to reduce the tax burden on families, increase disposable income, encourage professional activity, and stimulate consumption. Nawrocki made zero personal income tax (PIT) a central promise during his presidential campaign. He first announced the measure in March as part of his ""Contract with the Poles,"" pledging to implement it from the first day of his presidency. After winning the June run-off, he signed the bill in August 8 before sending it to the Sejm, Poland’s parliament.Zero PIT is also part of a package known as the ""tax armour,"" which includes a reduction in VAT from 23 per cent to 22 per cent, the abolition of capital gains tax, and the introduction of a quota-based pension indexation.Experts note that the benefits of the new tax law are likely to be greater for wealthier families. Piotr Juszczyk, chief tax adviser at inFakt, said, “Low-income families, who pay little or no income tax, will gain a negligible amount while those with high incomes will benefit the most.”Families earning 7,000 zloty (€1,648) a month can expect a relief of around 395 zloty (€93) per month, while those earning 12,000 zloty (€2,826) per month could save 913 zloty (€215) monthly, or over 11,000 zloty (€2,590) annually. Families earning the lowest national income will see only minimal savings, and those already below the tax-free threshold will see no change.Public outlook was largely positive. During consultations on 11 September, 476 people participated, with 76% supporting the new law and 66% approving the economic and financial assessment presented by the president. Only a small minority, around 16%, expressed strong opposition.","Poland's president Karol Nawrocki has approved a new law that removes personal income tax for parents raising at least two children.

A divided US appeals court on Monday cleared the way for President Donald Trump to send National Guard troops into Portland, Oregon, overruling objections from city and state leaders.A three-judge panel of the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals approved the Justice Department’s request to stay a lower court’s order that had previously blocked the deployment, allowing the legal challenge to proceed while troops are sent, Reuters reported.A three-judge panel of the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals granted the Justice Department's request to put on hold a judge's order that had blocked the deployment while a legal challenge to Trump's action plays out.The court said that sending in the National Guard was an appropriate response to protesters, who had damaged a federal building and threatened US Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers. The unsigned majority opinion was joined by Circuit Judge Bridget Bade and Circuit Judge Ryan Nelson, who were both appointed by Trump in his first term.Nelson also wrote a concurring opinion saying courts have no ability to even review the president's decision to send troops.Circuit Judge Susan Graber, an appointee of Democratic President Bill Clinton, dissented.

White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson welcomed the ruling, saying Trump had exercised his lawful authority to protect federal assets and personnel from protesters. Trump has asked the US Supreme Court to weigh his authority to send troops to Democratic-led cities, after another US appeals court ruled against his decision to send troops to Chicago.On October 4, Portland-based US District Judge Karin Immergut, who is also a Trump appointee, blocked Trump from sending any National Guard troops to Portland at least until the end of October, and has scheduled a non-jury trial set to begin on October 29 to determine whether to impose a longer-term block.Trump on September 27 had ordered 200 National Guard troops to Portland, continuing his administration's unprecedented use of military personnel in US cities to suppress protests and bolster domestic immigration enforcement. Trump called the city ""War ravaged"" and said, ""I am also authorizing Full Force, if necessary.""Oregon Governor Tina Kotek has appealed to a federal appeals court to overturn a decision by a three-judge panel made on Monday, which would allow Donald Trump to deploy federalised National Guard troops to the streets of Portland, despite opposition from state and local officials, as per the Guardian.Kotek expressed her hope that the full Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals will vacate the panel’s 2–1 decision, aligning with the request of the dissenting judge, Portland-based Susan Graber.“I’m very troubled by the decision of the court,” Kotek told reporters. “I still urge the Trump administration to send all the National Guard members home.”","A three-judge panel of the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals approved the Justice Department's request to stay a lower court’s order that had previously blocked the deployment. The court said that sending in the National Guard was an appropriate response to protesters, who had damaged a federal building and threatened US Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers.

Magistrate Judge David Ayo ruled, “The US Marshalls shall accommodate the defendant to the extent that they can reasonably do so.” He added that the court would revisit the issue if necessary and instructed Al-Muhtadi’s lawyers to remain in contact with the US Marshals regarding the requests.The accused lived in Gaza during the attack and is said to have been involved in the killing of 60 people at Kfar Aza, including four Americans, and the kidnapping of 19 others.

Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier has ramped up his investigation into Roblox, the hugely popular online gaming platform, issuing a criminal subpoena after evidence surfaced that sexual predators are exploiting the game to target minors.“Multiple investigations have revealed that sexual predators are using Roblox to access, communicate with, and groom minors,” Uthmeier said in a video posted on X. “Roblox profited off of our kids while exposing them to the most dangerous of harms. They enabled our kids to be abused. Companies like Roblox have become breeding grounds for predators to get to and have access to our kids.”The attorney general said predators have used the in-game currency, Robux, to bribe children into sending sexually explicit images. He added that victims accuse Roblox of failing to enforce adequate safety measures and of not warning parents of the risks.“These criminal subpoenas will enable us to gather more information for our prosecutors about the criminal activity taking place on Roblox’ platform as well as evidence on the predators that are out there and the victims that are abused,” Uthmeier said.Roblox responded that it shares the goal of keeping children safe and will continue to cooperate with the investigation, according to Florida Phoenix.“We have a strong record of working with law enforcement and investing in advanced safety systems to help protect our users and remove bad actors. To safeguard users, we prohibit the sharing of images and videos in the chat, use filters designed to block the exchange of personal information, and we are working to implement age estimation for all users accessing chat features,” the company said.Uthmeier appeared on Fox & Friends First to explain the investigation, noting that Florida authorities have arrested over 1,000 child predators this year alone, many linked to Roblox. He described predators posing as children, engaging in long-term conversations, and in some cases, committing physical abuse.Roblox has previously appeared on the National Center on Sexual Exploitation’s Dirty Dozen list for 2023 and 2024, which highlights entities accused of enabling or profiting from sexual abuse.",Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier has issued a criminal subpoena to Roblox.

This is a very big, diverse city you want to lead. We should get the names right,"" Giridharadas said as Cuomo looked on without making any acknowledgement. Giridharadas then moved on to his question Cuomo what he failed to see, despite having a strong and long political career, that Mamdani won the primary. ""I did not see the energy of the 20-30-year-olds, the anti-Isarel angle,"" Cuomo said adding that he did not understand how the anti-Israel anger could play a role in the mayor election as a mayor has nothing to do with that.Giridharadas shared the viral video and said he tried to do a public service by teaching Andrew Cuomo how to pronounce Zohran Mamdani's name.

From today onwards, they will have to study 128 questions instead of 100 and answer 12 out of 20 correctly. Officers will stop asking questions when an applicant answers 12 questions correctly, or 9 questions incorrectly.Applicants aged 65 and older who have been legal permanent residents for at least 20 years will take a modified version of the test. This version includes 10 questions randomly chosen from a bank of 20.A Green Card holder in the US is an alien who is a permanent resident but not a US citizen. To become naturalized citizens, they have to take this test. “American citizenship is the most sacred citizenship in the world and should only be reserved for aliens who will fully embrace our values and principles as a nation. By ensuring only those aliens who meet all eligibility requirements, including the ability to read, write, and speak English and understand U.S.government and civics, are able to naturalize, the American people can be assured that those joining us as fellow citizens are fully assimilated and will contribute to America’s greatness. These critical changes are the first of many,” said USCIS Spokesperson Matthew Tragesser.The latest change in the text also includes a holistic assessment of an alien's moral character which is not limited to a cursory scrutiny of whether they have been involved in any wrongdoing. The new moral character assessment will take a holistic look on an alien's behavior, adherence to social norms, and positive contributions that affirmatively demonstrae good moral character. Community involvement, family caregiving, educational attainment, stable and lawful employment history, length of lawful residency in the US and compliance with tax obligations and financial responsibility will also be checked.","New civics test for US citizenship begins today.

China successfully launched a Pakistani remote sensing satellite into orbit on Sunday, accompanied by two of its own satellites, underscoring the deepening space collaboration between the two long-time allies.A Lijian-1 Y8 carrier rocket carrying three satellites—the Pakistan Remote Sensing Satellite (PRSS-2) and China’s AIRSAT 03 and 04—was launched from a commercial aerospace innovation pilot zone in northwest China.

Pakistan And Afghanistan Agree To ‘Immediate Ceasefire’ After Peace Talks In Doha

Poll Are you in favor of continued international pressure on both nations to uphold peace agreements? Yes No





Pakistan and Afghanistan have agreed to an immediate ceasefire after several days of deadly cross-border clashes, Qatar’s foreign ministry said on Sunday. The announcement came after at least 10 people were killed in Pakistani airstrikes that followed an earlier truce.“During the negotiations, the two sides agreed to an immediate ceasefire and the establishment of mechanisms to ensure lasting peace and stability between the two countries,” Qatar’s ministry of foreign affairs said in a statement.Officials from both sides met in Doha on Saturday to ease tensions. Kabul had earlier accused Islamabad of breaking a 48-hour ceasefire that briefly paused nearly a week of fighting which killed dozens of soldiers and civilians on both sides.Security officials in Pakistan said the latest strikes in Afghan border areas targeted a militant group linked to the Pakistani Taliban. The attack, they said, came in response to an assault on Pakistani paramilitary forces.Pakistan’s delegation in Doha includes defence minister Khawaja Asif and intelligence chief general Asim Malik, while the Afghan side is led by defence minister Mohammad Yaqoob, the Taliban said.Violence erupted on October 11, just days after explosions in Kabul during a rare visit by Taliban foreign minister Amir Muttaqi to India.

Pakistan's field marshal Asim Munir has yet again engaged in anti-India rhetoric issuing veiled nuclear and economic threats while claiming that the ""misconceived"" immunity of India's geographic vastness will be shattered by the reach and lethality of their weapon systems.Speaking at the Pakistan military academy in Abbotabad (where Osama Bin Laden lived and was killed by the US) on Saturday, the rabble-rouser army chief threatened that a response far beyond the expectations of the initiators (India/Afghanistan) can be expected, if a fresh wave of hostilities is triggered.""With diminishing distinction between combat and communication zones, the reach and lethality of our weapon systems will shatter the misconceived immunity of India's geographic vastness,"" he added.He cautioned and advised the India's military leadership that there is no space for war in a nuclearised environment. ""Core issues should be settled with Pakistan as per international norms, on the basis of equality and mutual respect. The deeply hurting retributive military and economic losses to be inflicted will be beyond the imagination and calculations of those responsible for chaos and instability,"" the jihadi army chief said.Munir went on to claim that decisive responses will be made to even minor provocations and that the onus of ensuing escalations, which may bear catastrophic consequences for the entire region, will lie with India,"" he added.Referring to India and Afghanistan, with whom it is currently engaged in hostility, Munir said that the use of Fitna al-Hind and Fitna al-Khawarij (a reference to rebel groups like the BLA and TTP) as hired guns exposes its 'hypocritical and heinous' face to the world. ""Afghan Taliban regime should rein in the proxies who have sanctuaries in Afghanistan,” Munir added.Claiming the minerals and rare earth deposits in Balochistan would change Pakistan's future, he said, ""The treasures hidden beneath our land for decades have started to surface as a silver lining for our bright future.""","Pakistan's field marshal Asim Munir has yet again engaged in anti-India rhetoric.

What's happening?

Operation Sindoor and the Muridke connection





A state at war with itself





An imploding picture









“You can’t keep snakes in your backyard and expect them only to bite your neighbours.”External affairs minister S Jaishankar issued a stern warning to Pakistan at the United Nations in 2022. Three years later, Pakistan is yet to mend its ways, and the warning rings truer than ever. Then, both leaders accused Pakistan of nurturing terror groups for strategic leverage. Now, the country is confronting the full consequences of that strategy.Pakistan is in turmoil at all fronts, and at the centre of the latest crisis lies Muridke - the same city India struck during Operation Sindoor , a swift 22-minute campaign that targeted terror hubs including Markaz Taiba, the headquarters of Lashkar-e-Taiba.This week, Muridke is again in the spotlight as it turned volatile after Pakistan’s law enforcement cracked down on a protest camp organised by Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP). The government action has triggered violent clashes, arrests, and growing instability across the region.In a move dripping with irony, the provincial chief minister chaired what her office called an ""extraordinary"" meeting, ordering arrests of ""extremist leaders"" and seizure of assets linked to the same group once courted by the establishment.Over 2,700 people have been detained, and Section 144 has been imposed across Punjab, banning gatherings and protests.Mosques associated with the TLP have been sealed, its social media accounts suspended, and its top brass is being added to Pakistan’s Fourth Schedule—a list of individuals suspected of terrorism or sectarianism.Officials have also announced plans to recommend a federal ban on the party, freeze its assets, and prosecute its leaders under anti-terror laws. AI tools are being deployed to track wanted individuals.Authorities say the TLP’s so-called ""Gaza solidarity"" march to Islamabad had turned, as one official put it, ""bloody as always.""The timing and geography of the crackdown are significant. Muridke was among the nine key sites targeted during Operation Sindoor in May following the Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 civilians.During the four-day campaign, the Indian Air Force destroyed at least six Pakistani fighter jets, two high-value surveillance aircraft, a C-130 transport plane, over ten drones, several cruise missiles, and radar installations.One of its central objectives was Markaz Taiba, Lashkar-e-Taiba’s nerve centre in Muridke — just 25 km from the International Border. The facility, built with donations reportedly including Rs 10 lakh from Osama bin Laden, trained the 26/11 Mumbai attackers.For decades, Pakistan’s national security doctrine rested on militant proxies—to gain ""strategic depth"" against India and influence over Afghanistan. That policy has now imploded.Islamabad is fighting multiple insurgencies at once - from the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) in Balochistan, and even rogue Taliban factions across the Durand Line.According to the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), more than 2,400 security personnel have been killed in 2025 so far—the bloodiest year since 2015. The violence is now driven by what analysts call a ""Quad of Terror"": the TTP, Baloch insurgents, Islamic State–Khorasan (IS-K), and Taliban breakaway groups.Since the Taliban’s 2021 takeover of Kabul, Pakistan’s western frontier has unravelled. The TTP, long sheltered in Afghanistan, now launches near-daily attacks. The BLA targets Chinese projects in Gwadar and convoys in Balochistan. Despite repeated military operations, the insurgency only appears to be deepening.Drone strikes, air raids, and mass arrests have failed to stem the violence. Meanwhile, reports of enforced disappearances, civilian casualties, and militarisation have eroded public trust, especially in Balochistan.The TLP ban, border tensions with Afghanistan, and the fallout of Operation Sindoor together expose a grim truth that India has warned of several times: Pakistan’s long experiment with extremism has backfired catastrophically.When Hillary Clinton stood beside then-foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar, in 2011 and delivered the ""snakes in your backyard"" warning, it was a diplomatic metaphor. Today, it's Pakistan's reality.What began as a policy of control has spiralled into a crisis of survival. Pakistan's greatest threat is no longer at its borders: it's the legacy of its own choices.","Pakistan cracked down on a protest camp organised by Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) The government action has triggered violent clashes, arrests, and growing instability across the region.

Fierce Border Clash Between Pakistan, Afghanistan Intensifies With Tanks, Shelling, High Casualties

Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif on Friday said that his country can no longer maintain its past relations with Afghanistan, alleging, without evidence, that the Taliban leadership is ""sitting in India’s lap"" and warning of a ""heavy price"" for cross-border terrorism, signalling a public hardening of Islamabad’s stance toward a regime it once helped install.His comments came after at least six people, including two children, were killed and seven others injured in airstrikes conducted by Pakistan in Afghanistan’s southeastern Paktika province. The strikes reportedly violated a recent ceasefire agreement between the two countries. Media reports said that representatives from both sides are expected to meet in Doha, Qatar, to address the situation.""Pakistan can no longer afford to maintain relations with Kabul as it did in the past,"" Asif said in a social media post.""All Afghans residing on Pakistani soil must return to their homeland; they now have their own government/caliphate in Kabul... Our land and resources belong to 250 million Pakistanis,"" he added.""Self-respecting nations do not thrive on foreign land and resources,"" Asif said.He stated that despite Pakistan’s efforts and sacrifices over the past five years, Kabul has not responded positively. ""Pakistan issued 836 protest notes to the Afghan side and another 13 demarches,"" he said.Asif warned that Pakistan will now respond more strongly to acts of terrorism. ""There will no longer be protest notes or appeals for peace; no delegations will go to Kabul. Wherever the source of terrorism lies, it will have to pay a heavy price,"" he said.He also alleged that Afghanistan has become a ""proxy of India"" and is working with New Delhi and the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) against Islamabad.""The rulers of Kabul, who are now sitting in India’s lap and conspiring against Pakistan, were once under our protection, hiding on our land,"" Asif said, without providing any evidence for his claim.Earlier this week, MEA Spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal, while addressing the weekly press briefing, said that Pakistan is habituated in blaming its neighbours for its internal problems. ""On the developments that are happening on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, we are closely monitoring the situation three things are clear. One, Pakistan hosts terrorist organisations and sponsors terrorist activities. Two, it is an old practice of Pakistan to blame its neighbors for its own internal failures. And three, Pakistan is infuriated with Afghanistan exercising sovereignty over its own territories. India remains fully committed to the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Afghanistan,"" he had said.The Pakistan defense minister reiterated that Pakistan is prepared to defend itself against any aggression from Afghanistan.Earlier this week, Asif said that Pakistan is ready to respond if the Afghan Taliban ""wish for war."" Speaking to Samaa TV, he said, ""Pakistan remains ready for any aggression; no one should harbour doubt.""Islamabad has repeatedly called on the Taliban government to ensure that Afghan territory is not used for cross-border attacks. Kabul has denied these claims, saying that Afghan soil is not being used against any neighbouring country.Tensions between the two nations have grown following repeated attacks by the TTP, allegedly launched from Afghan soil. A recent attack in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Orakzai district killed 11 Pakistani soldiers, including a Lieutenant Colonel and a Major.","Khawaja Asif says Pakistan can no longer maintain its past relations with Afghanistan.

Pakistan army chief Asim Munir on Saturday repeated his anti-India rhetoric amid its ongoing border tensions with neighbouring Afghanistan.

We will never be intimidated nor coerced by your rhetoric and shall respond decisively beyond proportions to even a minor provocation without any qualms,"" he said.India has repeatedly warned of Operation Sindoor 2.0 against Pakistan-based terror groups in case of any aggression from the other side. During the May 7 military operations, India targeted nine terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, eliminating over 100 terrorists.The Operation Sindoor was launched in retaliation to the Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 civilians on April 22.However, this is not the first time that Munir has made unprovoked statements against India. In the weeks leading up to the Pahalgam attack, Munir had stirred controversy by invoking the two-nation theory—the ideological foundation of Pakistan’s creation—urging citizens to inculcate in their children a sense of distinction from Hindus. He had further escalated tensions by describing Kashmir as Pakistan’s “jugular vein,” a phrase long associated with Islamabad’s territorial ambitions.Just days after the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack, which claimed 26 lives, Munir reiterated his stance, declaring, ""The two-nation theory was based on the fundamental belief that Muslims and Hindus are two separate nations, not one. Muslims are distinct from Hindus in all aspects of life – religion, customs, traditions, thinking and aspirations.""","Pakistan army chief Asim Munir repeated his anti-India rhetoric amid its ongoing border tensions with neighbouring Afghanistan.

A new kind of threat







An uneasy ceasefire may have paused six days of fierce fighting between Pakistan and Afghanistan, but the name haunting Islamabad remains the same: Noor Wali Mehsud, the militant cleric Pakistan blames for bringing the country to the brink.As Reuters reported, Pakistani forces believed they had their moment last week when an airstrike in Kabul targeted an armoured Toyota Land Cruiser thought to be carrying Mehsud, leader of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). But the strike failed. Militants and Pakistani officials said he survived, and soon after, the group released an audio message purportedly from him, proof, perhaps, that the TTP chief had once again slipped through Pakistan’s grasp.The strike, Pakistan's first in Kabul since the 2022 US drone killing of Al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, was followed by deadly clashes along the Afghan border. For nearly a week, both sides exchanged artillery and drone fire, killing dozens and injuring hundreds. As Associated Press reported, Taliban officials accused Islamabad of carrying out two drone strikes in Kabul just hours before the truce took effect, while the UN urged both sides to end hostilities.Behind Pakistan’s anger lies a deeper grievance: Mehsud’s continued sanctuary in Afghanistan. Islamabad has repeatedly accused Kabul’s Taliban rulers of harbouring him and his lieutenants, an allegation the Afghan Taliban deny.According to Reuters, Mehsud, a 47-year-old cleric trained in Pakistan’s seminaries, revived the TTP after years of disarray. When he took over in 2018, the group was fractured and on the run, its leaders killed in US drone strikes. But Mehsud, described by analysts as both “a strategist and an ideologue,” united splinter factions, reorganised command, and shifted tactics.Unlike his predecessors, Mehsud curtailed attacks on civilians, a deliberate move to regain sympathy in Pakistan’s tribal belt after the horror of the 2014 Peshawar school massacre, which killed over 130 children. He ordered fighters to focus instead on the army and police, portraying Pakistan’s military as “anti-Islam” and accusing its generals of “hijacking the people of Pakistan for 78 years.”Under his leadership, the TTP renewed its insurgency. The UN’s Al-Qaeda Sanctions Committee lists him for “financing, planning, and perpetrating” terrorist acts, noting the group’s claims of deadly strikes on Pakistani security forces in North Waziristan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2019. As of late 2022, UN records placed Mehsud in Afghanistan’s Paktika province, near the border.Born in 1978 in South Waziristan’s Machikhel village, Mehsud studied at multiple Islamic seminaries across Pakistan before joining jihadist ranks. As detailed by the Pakistan Institute for Peace Studies (PIPS), he fought alongside the Afghan Taliban in the 1990s, later joining the TTP in 2003. He rose quickly first as a judge in TTP’s shadow courts, then as its Karachi chief, and finally as deputy to Maulana Fazlullah before taking command in 2018.What distinguishes Mehsud from other militants is his intellectual bent. He is the author of several books, including Inqilab-e-Mehsud (The Mehsud Revolution), a 700-page account linking his movement to anti-colonial resistance. In it, he even claimed responsibility for orchestrating the 2007 assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, saying she planned to ally with the U.S. against the mujahideen.Analysts describe him as both “a battlefield commander and a theorist.” He views Pakistan’s military operations against militants as a “defensive jihad” retaliation against what he portrays as the army’s betrayal of tribal traditions by handing over foreign fighters to the U.S. His stated goals: preserving Mehsud tribal autonomy, defeating America in Afghanistan, and establishing a Taliban-style Islamic system.Since the Taliban’s takeover of Kabul in 2021, Mehsud’s TTP has enjoyed renewed momentum. Pakistan claims the group has used Afghan soil to launch near-daily attacks, particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Efforts at negotiation have failed. According to Reuters, the TTP’s demands implementing Islamic law in border regions and the army’s withdrawal were flatly rejected by Islamabad.The failed airstrike in Kabul has made Mehsud an even more defiant figure. His survival has not only embarrassed Pakistan’s military but also underscored the fragility of its ties with Kabul. For now, an uneasy truce holds, but the man once dismissed as a fugitive cleric has managed to force Pakistan into one of its deadliest border crises in decades, a testament to the enduring power of Noor Wali Mehsud, the scholar-commander who turned ideology into insurgency.","Noor Wali Mehsud is the leader of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) Pakistani forces believed they had their moment last week when an airstrike in Kabul targeted an armoured Toyota Land Cruiser. But the strike failed, and soon after, the group released an audio message purportedly from him.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124608751,imgsize-1430487,width-400,resizemode-4/noor-wali-mehsud.jpg"

Pakistan Seeks Trump’s Intervention After Afghan-Taliban Forces Humiliate Pak Army In Border Clash





Afghanistan’s Taliban government on Thursday claimed that Pakistan carried out two drone strikes on Kabul on Wednesday, even as the two neighbours declared a 48-hour ceasefire following days of deadly cross-border clashes that killed dozens and injured hundreds.The strikes, according to Taliban officials, targeted a civilian house and a market in Kabul, with hospital sources reporting at least five killed and dozens injured.Emergency, an Italian NGO running a surgical centre in the city, said patients suffered shrapnel wounds, burns, and blunt trauma.Khalid Zadran, spokesman for the Kabul police chief, confirmed the attacks but did not provide exact casualty figures, as per the news agency AP Earlier, Taliban chief spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid initially described the incident as an oil tanker explosion.Pakistani officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the strikes were aimed at militant hideouts, reported AP.Cross-border violence had escalated since October 10, with both Islamabad and Kabul accusing each other of harbouring militants.On Wednesday, the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) reported at least 17 civilians killed and 346 injured in Spin Boldak on the Afghan side of the border, while noting further casualties in previous clashes.The UN urged both countries to “bring a lasting end to hostilities to protect civilians”.The temporary truce, which came into effect at 6 pm Islamabad time on Wednesday, was aimed at halting bloodshed and creating a window for dialogue.Meanwhile, Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday said ‘the ball is in the Afghan Taliban's court"" and the extension of the ceasefire depends on Kabul’s response. “If in 48 hours they want to resolve the issues and address our genuine demands, then we are ready for them,” he said, reiterating that Afghan territory should not be used to plan attacks by Pakistani Taliban militants.According to the news agency AFP, Spin Boldak residents were observed returning home, and shops were reopening under the fragile truce, while municipal workers in Kabul were repairing roads and buildings damaged by the Wednesday blasts.Blasts had also caused overnight blackouts in parts of the city. Emergency’s country director, Dejan Panic, said, “We started receiving ambulances filled with wounded people… Ten are in critical condition.”The 2,611-kilometre-long Durand Line, which Afghanistan does not formally recognise, remains a flashpoint as Pakistan continues to combat attacks from the Tehreek-e-Taliban ( TTP ) and other armed groups operating along the border.Islamabad has repeatedly accused Kabul of providing safe havens to militants, a charge denied by the Taliban.","Taliban claims Pakistan carried out two drone strikes on Kabul on Wednesday.

PM Sushila Karki Vows Stability and Transparency While Briefing Diplomats on Nepal’s Polls





Nepal’s deposed Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli on Sunday accused the current government of trying to arrest him “without sufficient ground” and claimed it was not serious about conducting the general election scheduled for March 5, 2026.During his first interaction with editors and senior journalists in Kathmandu since his ouster, Oli said his party, the CPN-UML, would seek reinstatement of the dissolved House of Representatives. He alleged that the government was attempting to arrest him “by hook or crook,” despite lacking sufficient grounds.Oli resigned in early September after violent protests by the youth-led Gen Z group against his government over corruption and a ban on social media. Former top judge Sushila Karki was appointed interim prime minister on September 12, and President Ramchandra Paudel dissolved parliament on her recommendation. The next general election is scheduled for March 5, 2026.Referring to his removal from office, Oli said that after he was rescued by the Nepal Army from the Prime Minister’s residence at Baluwatar following the attack by protesters, his mobile phone was seized for a few days.He also criticised the government for withdrawing some of his security personnel, saying it had failed to ensure a secure atmosphere for free and fair elections.The former prime minister claimed that during his tenure, “the law and order situation was better and the press was more secure,” adding that now “the media has become insecure and they have started self-censorship.” He accused the media of ignoring “the vandalism and arson done in the name of the Gen Z group that destroyed many important government buildings, including the Prime Minister’s Office at Singhdurbar, the Supreme Court, Parliament Building and the anti-graft body,"" as quoted by PTI.Oli alleged that the violence during the Gen Z protests was caused by “infiltration of external elements,” though he did not specify who they were. The Gen Z protesters had demanded the arrest of then Prime Minister Oli and Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak, holding them responsible for the excessive use of force during the agitation.Commenting on the “Nepo-kids” movement launched by Gen Z youths alongside their protests, Oli said, “I couldn’t accept the Nepo-babe campaign launched by the Gen Z youths, which created terror among the Nepalese people.” The campaign had targeted the children of influential leaders for their lavish lifestyles allegedly funded by corruption.Unlike other top leaders, including Nepali Congress president Sher Bahadur Deuba and CPN-Maoist Centre chair Pushpakamal Dahal “Prachanda,” who resigned from their party posts, Oli said he had no plans to step down as CPN-UML chair. “I may come back to power if people vote for me. The country and my party still need me, and I am still capable of contributing to the country and the society,” he said.After hiding in an army camp outside Kathmandu following his ouster, Oli stayed in Gundu, Bhaktapur district, for a few weeks before reappearing publicly during a central committee meeting of his party recently, reported PTI.",Nepal's deposed Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli accused the current government of trying to arrest him “without sufficient ground” Oli resigned in early September after violent protests by the youth-led Gen Z group against his government.

Pakistan Seeks Trump’s Intervention After Afghan-Taliban Forces Humiliate Pak Army In Border Clash





Afghan sources on Saturday accused the Pakistani military of repeatedly violating Afghanistan’s border, saying Islamabad breached Afghan territory over 1,200 times and its airspace on 710 occasions in the past four years.The allegations come amid a deadly escalation along the Durand Line following Pakistani airstrikes on Kabul and other provinces.The latest clashes intensified after at least three Afghan cricketers were reportedly killed in a Pakistani airstrike in Paktika province. In response, Afghanistan carried out limited retaliatory operations on October 11 against Pakistani positions, citing its right to self-defense under international law. “We do not seek to escalate the situation, but if the Pakistanis insist on violating Afghan air and ground space, or carry out bombings, we will be compelled to give a firm and befitting response, because defending our land and people is our inherent right and responsibility,” the sources said, as quoted by PTI.Afghan officials detailed the human and material toll of the violations. “Dozens of homes and shops were destroyed, and considerable financial losses were inflicted on civilians,” one source said.From the start of 2024 until now, 102 civilians and Afghan border guards have been killed, with 139 others wounded due to cross-border attacks.The sources said Pakistani forces carried out over 712 airspace violations in the past four years, including 16 bombings with jets and drones in the provinces of Nuristan, Kunar, Nangarhar, Khost, Paktia, and Paktika. These attacks reportedly killed 114 Pakistani tribal refugees, Afghan civilians, and Afghan border guards.Afghan sources also cited August of this year, when Pakistani airstrikes targeted Nuristan, Nangarhar, and Khost provinces. “There were no casualties in Nuristan and Nangarhar, and contrary to their claims there were no members of any anti-Pakistan group present there. But in Khost province they killed three children from an Afghan family (civilians) and wounded four women,” the sources said.Even before the latest retaliation, Afghanistan had largely limited its response to diplomatic protests. The sources highlighted an October 9 incident when Pakistani combat jets violated Kabul’s airspace on the eve of a scheduled meeting between Afghan foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi and Indian external affairs minister S Jaishankar , producing loud aerial explosions over the capital.Afghan officials emphasised that recent retaliatory operations were mostly confined to areas repeatedly subjected to Pakistani artillery, mortar fire, drone incursions, and other violations. They insisted that the operations were defensive in nature and aimed at protecting Afghan territory and civilians, reported PTI.","Afghan sources accuse Pakistan of repeatedly violating Afghanistan’s border.

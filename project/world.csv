Trump demands $500 billion worth of rare earth



What are rare earth minerals?



US President Donald Trump on Monday demanded that Ukraine should provide the United States with rare earth minerals in return for financial aid for war against Russia. His remarks come as his administration prepares to send a special envoy to Ukraine to discuss a proposal to end the ongoing war with Russia.Speaking in an interview with Fox News on Monday, Trump said, ""We are going to have all this money in there, and I say I want it back. And I told them that I want the equivalent, like $500 billion worth of rare earth."" He added, ""And they have essentially agreed to do that, so at least we don't feel stupid.""Trump also said Ukraine ""may be Russian someday, or they may not be Russian someday,"" while discussing possible outcomes of the war. He has pushed for a quick resolution to the conflict but has not yet outlined a detailed plan for negotiations.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has previously raised the possibility of allowing the US to develop Ukraine’s natural resources as part of efforts to secure continued support. ""The Americans helped the most, and therefore the Americans should earn the most,"" Zelenskyy told news agency Reuters on Friday. ""I would also like to talk about this with President Trump.""Trump confirmed that his special envoy, Keith Kellogg, will soon travel to Ukraine to draft a plan to end the fighting. Ukrainian officials said Kellogg would arrive on February 20, just days before the third anniversary of Russia’s invasion on February 24.US vice president JD Vance is also set to meet Zelenskyy this Friday on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, where US Secretary of State Marco Rubio will also be present.Zelenskyy has repeatedly called for strong security guarantees from the US and Nato as part of any deal with Russia. Kyiv fears that without concrete military commitments, any settlement would give Moscow time to regroup for another attack.Meanwhile, Russian forces continue advancing in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region and have been targeting energy infrastructure in recent months. On Tuesday, Ukraine's energy minister said the country is applying emergency power supply restrictions to minimize the impact of ongoing attacks.Rare earth elements are a group of 17 elements that play a key role in consumer technology, including cellphones, hard drives, and electric and hybrid vehicles.It is not clear which specific elements Trump is referring to in Ukraine, though the country has a variety of valuable minerals. ""It can be lithium. It can be titanium, uranium, many others,"" said Andriy Yermak, Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine. ""It's a lot.""China, which Trump has often criticized as a geopolitical rival, is the largest producer of rare earth elements. Both the U.S. and Europe have been working to reduce their reliance on Beijing for these critical resources.For Ukraine, a deal involving its mineral resources could help secure continued U.S. military support, which is crucial as the country approaches the fourth year of war with Russia. The proposal also comes at a time when access to key minerals is becoming increasingly difficult worldwide.",Trump demands $500 billion worth of rare earth minerals in return for financial aid for war against Russia.

Scientists Watch 'City-Killer' Asteroid 2024 YR4 as It Looms Over Earth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/city-killer-why-scientists-are-watching-asteroid-2024-yr4-closely/articleshow/118134805.cms,"What would a strike look like?

China steps up

planetary defense

A matter of time and observation

(With inputs from agencies)

On Christmas Day 2024, an asteroid nearly the size of a football field silently slipped past Earth, coming within twice the distance of the Moon. Just two days later, astronomers peering through a Chilean telescope noticed something disconcerting: this space rock, now designated 2024 YR4, might not miss us next time.Since then, its trajectory has set off a flurry of calculations, scientific scrutiny, and, in some corners, existential anxiety. According to Nasa and the European Space Agency (ESA), there is now a 1.6% chance that this asteroid could collide with Earth on December 22, 2032. While the odds remain low, they are high enough to put 2024 YR4 at the top of ESA’s asteroid risk list, and to compel nations—including China—to begin preparing for the worst-case scenario.If 2024 YR4 were to hit, it would not trigger a global catastrophe, but the consequences would be devastating at a local level. Scientists categorize this type of asteroid as a “city-killer.” The explosion from its impact or atmospheric detonation could release energy equivalent to eight megatons of TNT—roughly 500 times the power of the Hiroshima bomb.Historical comparisons are chilling. In 1908, an asteroid or comet fragment measuring about 30–50 meters exploded over Siberia in what became known as the Tunguska Event . The blast leveled 80 million trees across an area larger than Tokyo. If a similar explosion occurred over a major city today, the consequences would be catastrophic.The asteroid’s projected impact zone, should it hit, spans vast and densely populated areas, including the eastern Pacific, South America, Africa, the Atlantic Ocean, the Arabian Sea, and parts of South Asia. Even an oceanic impact could be perilous, potentially triggering tsunamis and widespread coastal damage.As per a South China Morning Post report, China has begun assembling a planetary defense team to prepare for potential asteroid threats. A recruitment notice from the country’s State Administration of Science, Technology, and Industry for National Defense lists three positions dedicated to asteroid monitoring and early warning research.""In the future, we must not only comprehensively strengthen equipment configuration and performance but also cultivate a team of talent dedicated to asteroid defense,"" said Li Mingtao, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Science’s National Space Science Center.The Chinese government has already unveiled a conceptual plan for its first planetary defense mission. Slated for the early 2030s, the mission would deploy a spacecraft to observe and then alter the trajectory of a threatening asteroid—a strategy reminiscent of Nasa’s successful 2022 DART mission, which deliberately crashed a probe into an asteroid to shift its path, the SCMP report said.Despite the flurry of activity, many scientists remain calm. History suggests that as more observations refine our understanding of 2024 YR4’s orbit, the impact probability may drop to zero—just as it did with the asteroid Apophis, once thought to pose a real threat to Earth in 2029.“We are not worried at all, because of this 99 percent chance it will miss,"" said Paul Chodas, director of Nasa's Center for Near Earth Object Studies. ""But it deserves attention.""For now, the asteroid is moving away from Earth, making its next close approach in 2028. The world’s most advanced telescopes will keep tracking it, updating risk assessments in real time. Meanwhile, China, the U.S., and the broader international community must grapple with a bigger question: If a major asteroid impact is ever truly imminent, will the world be ready?","There is a 1.6% chance that 2024 YR4 could collide with Earth on December 22, 2032.

Gaza: The Trump family's Middle East business interests,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/gaza-the-trump-familys-middle-east-business-interests/articleshow/118133997.cms,"What are

Trump

's business interests in the Middle East?

What about Saudi Arabia?

Is there a conflict of interest for Trump?

Does Trump genuinely view Gaza as a potential real estate deal?

US President Donald Trump 's comments on February 4 about Gaza revived an idea previously touted by both him and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner .His latest plan positions Gaza in terms of real estate potential, rather than the humanitarian or political situation for its inhabitants. After claiming that the US would ""take over the Gaza Strip"" and ""own it,"" Donald Trump said:""We have an opportunity to do something that could be phenomenal. And I don't want to be cute. I don't want to be a wise guy. But the 'Riviera of the Middle East,' this could be something that could be so, this could be so magnificent.""It echoes sentiments expressed by Kushner in an interview at Harvard University in February 2024 when he said Gaza's waterfront property could be ""very valuable if people would focus on building up livelihoods."" He added that from Israel's perspective he would do his best to ""move the people out and then clean it up.""Trump has since doubled down, even suggesting that Palestinians wouldn't be allowed return to Gaza, ""because they're going to have much better housing,"" he told Fox News on February 10.It's a reminder that for Trump and his family, the Middle East is as much a business interest as anything else.The region has become a growing focus for The Trump Organization, the real estate and hospitality conglomerate currently run by Trump's sons Eric and Donald Junior.In the last few years, The Trump Organization has struck several agreements with Saudi Arabian real estate company Dar Global, the international arm of Saudi Arabia 's Dar Al Arkan Real Estate Development Company.A luxury Trump-branded hotel and golf resort in Oman is in development, while The Trump Organization and Dar Global have announced plans for two Trump Tower projects, in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia and in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.A previous Trump Tower for Dubai, comprising of a hotel and apartments, was announced in October 2005. However, the project was cancelled in 2011 due to the global financial crisis.Trump already owns a golf club in Dubai, which was opened in 2017. The Dubai golf club was built in partnership with DAMAC Properties, run by Hussain Sajwani . In January 2025, Sajwani appeared alongside Trump at a press conference where it was announced that DAMAC would invest ""at least"" $20 billion (€19.39 billion) to build new data centres across the US.The new agreements in Oman, Jeddah and Dubai will see The Trump Organization design, manage and brand the towers and the luxury resort. The deals are primarily about branding rather than ownership, earning the family millions in exchange for using their name.Trump and his relatives have repeatedly spoken of the Middle East's growing relevance to their business interests.Shortly before the Jeddah deal was announced, Eric Trump told the British financial newspaper Financial Times: ""We will definitely be doing other projects in this region. This region has explosive growth, and that's not stopping anytime soon.""Saudi Arabia, a key US ally in the Middle East, is increasingly central to the Trump family interests there.As well as the Dar Global goals, the Trump Organization has also collaborated closely with LIV Golf , one of the kingdom's much vaunted and controversial sports investments. The Trump Organization owns many golf courses around the world and has been paid by LIV to host several tournaments at its venues in the US.Meanwhile, Kushner's own private equity firm, Affinity Partners, which is separate to the Trump Organization, has courted close ties with Saudi Arabia and its sovereign wealth fund, known as the Public Investment Fund (PIF).The PIF, which is chaired by Saudi crown price and de facto ruler Mohammed bin Salman , has invested $2 billion in Affinity. Several other major Gulf investors have also poured money into Kushner's project, including the Qatar Investment Authority and the Abu Dhabi-based asset manager Lunate.Kushner also has substantial investments in Israel, particularly the insurance company Phoenix Holdings and the Shlomo Group.The extensive business interests have led to criticisms that there could be multiple conflict of interests arising for Trump when dealing with issues in the region.Although Donald Trump resigned from all management roles in his businesses when first elected to the presidency in 2016, his family have remained prominent in his political activities and campaigns despite their continuing roles in the business.Kushner meanwhile has leveraged contacts he made during his previous role as an adviser in the first Trump administration to build up his investment portfolio in the Middle East. That has been criticized, particularly his close relationship with the Saudi royal family.However, he defended himself in early 2024 in an interview with US news website Axios, saying: ""If you ask me about the work that we did in the White House, for my critics, what I say is: point to a single decision we made that wasn't in the interest of America.""Both Trump and Kushner are clearly keen on the idea of developing Gaza in terms of a real estate project, rather than as a home for the more than 2 million Palestinians who currently live there.""The world's people will be living there,"" Trump said. ""Make that into an international, unbelievable place. The potential in the Gaza Strip is unbelievable.""Trump's comments provoked furious reactions from Palestinians and swift condemnations from a wide range of governments around the world. There are huge doubts over its viability on multiple levels.However, given The Trump Organization's growing real estate business interests in the region, and the unambiguous comments from both Trump and his son-in-law, it appears they, at least, are serious about the idea.","US President Donald Trump revived an idea previously touted by both him and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner.

However, the newly discovered documents remains secret at least for now.“This is huge. It shows the FBI is taking this seriously,” said Jefferson Morley, the vice president of the Mary Ferrell Foundation , which has the largest online record of JFK assassination records.“The FBI is finally saying, ‘Let’s respond to the president’s order,’ instead of keeping the secrecy going,” he added.Earlier in January, Trump had ordered the declassification of all remaining classified records related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, fulfilling a long-standing promise.The move was formalised through an executive order, which also called for the release of files concerning the assassinations of Senator Robert F. Kennedy and the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.“The families and the American people deserve transparency and truth,” the order said, adding that it is in the national interest to release these records without further delay.While the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 mandated full public disclosure of the files by October 2017, exemptions have allowed for the continued withholding of certain documents.Trump’s order claimed that continued redactions are “not consistent with the public interest.”""I have now determined that the continued redaction and withholding of information from records pertaining to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy is not consistent with the public interest and the release of these records is long overdue,"" it read.During his re-election campaign, Trump had pledged to release the remaining Kennedy assassination files, a promise he also made during his first term but later walked back, citing advice from intelligence officials.Former CIA Director Mike Pompeo was among those who urged Trump to keep certain files classified, citing potential national security concerns.Speculation around Kennedy’s assassination has persisted for decades. Kennedy was fatally shot in Dallas on November 22, 1963, and while Lee Harvey Oswald was identified as the lone gunman, conspiracy theories have long overshadowed the official narrative.","FBI has discovered around 2,400 new records related to President John F.

Two flights carrying about 190 Venezuelans deported from the United States landed in Caracas late Monday, marking the first repatriation under a new agreement between Venezuela and the Trump administration.The arrivals follow a January 31 meeting between Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and Trump’s special envoy, Richard Grenell, in which Maduro agreed to accept deported migrants.As the first plane touched down, Maduro announced on national television, “The first plane has just arrived.” Shortly after, a second aircraft landed carrying additional deportees, according to AFP.The deportees included individuals suspected of having ties to the Tren de Aragua gang , a notorious Venezuelan criminal organization. Authorities have said that these individuals would be investigated further.Trump, who has promised the largest deportation campaign in US history, confirmed Venezuela's cooperation, writing on Truth Social that ""Venezuela has agreed to receive, back into their Country, all Venezuela illegal aliens who were encamped in the US, including gang members of Tren de Aragua.”He also said that Venezuela would fund the transportation of deportees. The White House later posted a photo of handcuffed and shackled individuals boarding a Conviasa plane, with the caption, “Repatriation flights to Venezuela have resumed… Make America Safe Again.The flights could mark a turning point in strained US-Venezuela relations, though it remains unclear what Maduro gained from the deal. His government issued a statement expressing hope for ""a new beginning of relations between the two countries, based on respect”.Despite this, Washington still does not recognise Maduro as Venezuela’s legitimate leader, maintaining that the 2024 election he claimed victory in was fraudulent.Human rights organisations have raised alarms over the deportations, arguing that many of those sent back could face persecution. Laura Dib, a Venezuela analyst at the Washington Office on Latin America, warned that returnees might ""face retaliations"" from Maduro’s regime, according to the New York Times.The US previously attempted deportation flights to Venezuela under the Biden administration in 2023, but Maduro withdrew permission after just a few months. Biden had initially relaxed sanctions on Venezuelan oil in exchange for political reforms but reimposed them when Maduro failed to meet democratic commitments.Meanwhile, Trump’s administration has maintained a strict stance against Venezuelan oil, stating, ""We don’t need Venezuelan oil.”It remains uncertain whether more deportation flights will follow, as neither Venezuela nor the US have commented on future plans.","Two flights carrying 190 Venezuelans deported from the United States landed in Caracas late Monday.

Google Calendar users have noticed that several cultural observances, including Pride Month, Black History Month, and Holocaust Remembrance Day, have been removed from the platform’s default holiday list.The change, which was first reported by The Verge, has triggered criticism from users and reignited debates over tech companies’ shifting stance on diversity initiatives.Google Calendar previously included observances such as February 1 (Black History month), March 1 (Women’s History Month), June 1 (Pride Month) and November 1 (Indigenous Peoples Month).However, for 2025, these events no longer appear in the calendar’s default settings.Instead, Google now only displays public holidays and national observances sourced from timeanddate.com, a long-time data partner. The company had quietly begun this shift in mid-2024 but did not make a public announcement, leading to confusion and frustration among users, according to GB News.Following the backlash, Google spokesperson Madison Cushman Veld defended the decision and was quoted by The Verge saying, ""Some years ago, the Calendar team started manually adding a broader set of cultural moments in a wide number of countries around the world. We got feedback that some other events and countries were missing — and maintaining hundreds of moments manually and consistently globally wasn’t scalable or sustainable.""Google encourages users to manually add observances to their personal calendars and provide feedback through the built-in Calendar tool.Many Google Calendar users expressed disappointment on social media, accusing the company of downplaying important cultural moments. Some called the change ""shameful"" and accused Google of ""capitulating to fascism.""The shift comes amid a broader rollback of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives across the US tech industry. Several companies, including Meta, Intel, and PayPal, have scaled back diversity hiring programs, while Amazon removed references to ""inclusion and diversity"" from its earnings report.Disney also removed its ""Reimagine Tomorrow"" DEI program from its latest corporate report but added an initiative focused on hiring US military veterans, according to GB News.As of now, Google has not indicated whether it plans to restore the removed observances.

Nancy Mace Accuses Ex-Fiance of Assault and Rape in Explosive House Speech,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/nancy-mace-accuses-ex-fianc-associates-of-assaulting-her-raping-others-in-house-speech/articleshow/118134168.cms,"Former fiancé denies allegations

Mace’s political positioning

Attorney General's office denies knowledge of allegations

Shocking accusations of hidden videos and assault

Republican Representative Nancy Mace, who has recently hinted at a potential run for governor of South Carolina, on Monday night accused her former fiancé and three other men of drugging and raping her and other women. She further alleged that they had filmed and taken lewd photographs of women and underage girls without their consent.In an unprecedented, graphic speech on the House floor, Mace named the men and displayed their photographs on a placard—where lawmakers typically showcase policy charts and graphs—as she accused them of engaging in the premeditated and calculated exploitation of innocent women and girls in her district.She stated that the men had condemned themselves to hell, describing it as a one-way journey with no connections, where she and all their victims would be able to witness their eternal suffering. Her speech lasted nearly an hour.Mace made these allegations while speaking under the speech and debate clause, which grants lawmakers immunity from criminal prosecution or civil lawsuits when acting within the legislative sphere.Shortly after her speech, Patrick Bryant, the former fiancé she accused by name, issued a statement denying all allegations. He said he categorically rejected the claims and emphasised that he took the matter seriously, pledging full cooperation with any necessary legal proceedings to clear his name.Mace has previously spoken about her personal trauma, making it a key part of her political identity. She has shared experiences of being molested at a swimming pool when she was 14, which led her to blame herself for wearing a two-piece swimsuit. She has also spoken about being raped at 16, which caused her to drop out of high school before turning her life around and becoming the first woman to graduate from the Citadel, South Carolina’s military college.While positioning herself as a strong advocate for women’s rights, Mace has also been an unwavering supporter of Donald Trump, who has been found liable for sexual abuse. She has also backed a cabinet member who has faced sexual assault allegations, which he has denied.Recently, Mace has actively promoted a campaign to ban transgender individuals from using women’s restrooms and changing rooms in the Capitol complex.She has also made it clear that she is interested in running for governor. Another potential contender, South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson, was a target of her speech, as Mace accused him of being ineffective and claimed he treated women who came forward as criminals.She stated that over the past year, after turning over everything to law enforcement, she was told that, as a victim, she would be investigated.A spokesperson for Wilson, Jaqueline Lane, refuted Mace’s accusations, calling them categorically false and politically motivated.Lane stated that their office had not received any reports or requests for assistance from law enforcement or prosecution agencies regarding these matters. She also said that neither Wilson nor his office had any prior knowledge of Mace’s claims before her speech.She noted that despite multiple encounters between Mace and Wilson in recent months, and despite Mace having Wilson’s personal phone number, she never approached or contacted him about her allegations.During her speech, Mace claimed that on her last night with Bryant, he physically assaulted her, leaving a permanent mark on her body. Prior to that, she alleged she had found dozens of compromising photos of underage girls on his phone, along with over 10,000 videos documenting the assault of incapacitated women and surreptitious recordings of women.She said she was horrified when she zoomed in on one of the videos and discovered that she had been filmed nude without her consent.Her speech was delivered in a mostly empty chamber after House votes, but three female Republican lawmakers—Lauren Boebert of Colorado, Anna Paulina Luna of Florida, and Victoria Spartz of Indiana—sat behind her in a show of solidarity.","Republican Representative Nancy Mace accused her former fiancé and three other men of drugging and raping her and other women.

Bill Gates Reveals Steve Jobs' LSD Suggestion to Boost Microsoft: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/bill-gates-recounts-steve-jobs-urging-him-to-take-lsd-to-boost-microsoft-report/articleshow/118133220.cms,"Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates revealed about his experimentation with drugs like LSD and Cannabis with Apple founder Steve Jobs during his teenage years.In an interview to The Independent, Gates said that he tried a lot of things because his personality is kind of optimistic, and he was willing to take risks.“But another thing about my personality is that I like my mind to work and be very logical. So I stopped doing even marijuana early in my 20s just because it made my mind sloppy, either during or the day afterwards,” Gates said.“I smoked pot in high school, but not because it did anything interesting. I thought maybe I would look cool and some girl would think that was interesting. It didn't succeed, so I gave it up,” he added.Microsoft co-founder said that former Apple CEO Steve Jobs, who didn’t know about his past drug use, teased him on the subject.“Steve Jobs once said that he wished I'd take acid because then maybe I would have had more taste in my design of my products,” recalled Gates.“My response to that was to say, ‘Look, I got the wrong batch.’ I got the coding batch, and this guy got the marketing-design batch, so good for him! Because his talents and mine, other than being kind of an energetic leader, and pushing the limits, they didn't overlap much. He wouldn’t know what a line of code meant, and his ability to think about design and marketing and things like that... I envy those skills. I'm not in his league,” he added.Gates added that he was a fan of Michael Pollan’s book about psychedelic drugs , How To Change Your Mind, and is intrigued by the idea that they may have therapeutic uses. “The idea that some of these drugs that affect your mind might help with depression or OCD, I think that's fascinating,” said Gates. “Of course, we have to be careful, and that's very different than recreational usage.”Gates expressed interest in the potential therapeutic applications of psychedelic drugs, referencing Michael Pollan's book ""How To Change Your Mind.""""The idea that some of these drugs that affect your mind might help with depression or OCD, I think that's fascinating.

During this episode, they traced mathematical symbols on a dewy car trunk.""The two backwards Es together, side by side, to him, to us, held some profound meaning. 'Bill, see this. Existence exists,' he said as we stared at the dewy car trunk. It was one of those moments that seem perfectly cosmic at the time and purely silly once the acid wears off.""Gates ultimately stopped taking LSD due to concerns about potential memory loss. He worried about the possibility of accidentally erasing his memories, comparing his brain to a computer's data storage system.","Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates revealed about his experimentation with drugs like LSD and Cannabis with Apple founder Steve Jobs during his teenage years.

What's Trump's plan for Gaza Strip

Trump talks Elon, his vision for Gaza and 'tremendous momentum'

Since his inauguration, US President Donald Trump has been making headlines for his unexpected decisions and executive orders. The 47th president of the United States once again raised eyebrows after he shared his vision to ""take over"" Gaza Strip once the war between Israel and Hamas ends. Since then, everyone has wondered what Donald Trump's 'real estate' Gaza will look like.However, in an interview with Fox News chief political anchor Bret Baier, the 78-year-old US leader reiterated his plan for ownership position of the Gaza Strip at some point in future.He reiterated his plans to have a ""long-term ownership position"" in the Gaza Strip saying that ""great people"" in Middle East can help transform the ""war-torn enclave"" into a ""beautiful and safe community.""Baier asked Trump about the right of Palestinians to return to Gaza, he said that they wouldn't because they ""will have much better housing.""""Much better – in other words, I’m talking about building a permanent place for them,"" he added.However, this proposal has sparked widespread debate, raising concerns among US allies in the Middle East and beyond.Central to Trump's proposal is the controversial idea of relocating Palestinians to neighbouring countries while reconstruction efforts are underway. This suggestion has faced firm rejection from key US Middle Eastern allies. Jordan's King Abdullah II, a vocal opponent of relocating Palestinians to Jordan, is expected to address the matter during his upcoming meeting with the president at the White House.Additionally, Egypt announced plans to host an emergency Arab summit in Cairo at the end of the month to discuss the ""new and dangerous developments in the Palestinian issue,"" according to the ministry of foreign affairs.Trump expressed confidence in securing agreements with Egypt and Jordan, citing the substantial financial aid the US provides to both countries. ""There's practically no building that's livable in the whole Gaza Strip. I say we go in, we knock them all down. We just create some — no more Hamas. There's no Hamas there. There's nobody there. We move them into beautiful areas of the Middle East,"" he explained.Further elaborating, Trump added, ""We'll build beautiful communities for the 1.9 million people. We'll build beautiful communities. Safe communities. [It] could be five, six could be two. But we'll build safe communities a little bit away from where they are, where all of this danger is. In the meantime, I would own this. Think of it as a real estate development for the future. It would be a beautiful piece of land.""","US President Donald Trump reiterated his plan for ownership position of the Gaza Strip.

The move reverses a Biden-era policy aimed at phasing out single-use plastics from federal operations.“It’s a ridiculous situation. We’re going back to plastic straws,” Trump said while signing the order, which instructs federal agencies to halt the purchase and distribution of paper straws in government buildings. The decision effectively scraps President Joe Biden’s initiative to eliminate single-use plastics, including straws, from federal food services by 2027 and from all operations by 2035.Trump, who has long criticised paper straws, reaffirmed his stance over the weekend, posting on social media that Biden’s policy was “DEAD!” His 2019 reelection campaign even sold Trump-branded plastic straws as a political statement against restrictions on single-use plastics.Environmental advocates argue that plastic straws contribute to pollution and threaten marine life, with experts warning that plastic waste, including straws, breaks down into harmful microplastics. Christy Leavitt, plastics campaign director at Oceana, called Trump’s decision misguided. “The world is facing a plastic pollution crisis , and we can no longer ignore one of the biggest environmental threats facing our oceans and our planet today,” she said.Despite widespread bans on plastic straws in various US states and cities, Trump dismissed environmental concerns, stating, “I don’t think that plastic is going to affect the shark very much as they’re eating, as they’re munching their way through the ocean.”The plastics industry has welcomed the decision. “Straws are just the beginning,” said Matt Seaholm, president and CEO of the Plastics Industry Association. “‘Back to Plastic’ is a movement we should all get behind.”According to the Straws Turtle Island Restoration Network, Americans use over 390 million plastic straws daily, with each straw taking around 200 years to decompose. Environmental groups have urged consumers to reduce plastic use to prevent further harm to wildlife.The global plastic pollution crisis has led to ongoing negotiations for an international treaty to limit plastic production and improve recycling efforts. Talks stalled last year in South Korea but are set to resume as more than 100 countries push for stricter regulations.Meanwhile, US manufacturers have called on Trump to stay engaged in the negotiations while reconsidering Biden’s approach, which emphasized redesigning plastics, increasing recycling, and promoting reusable materials.White House staff secretary Will Scharf, who presented the order to Trump, claimed the push for paper straws had been costly and unpopular. “It really is something that affects ordinary Americans in their everyday lives,” he said.",US President Donald Trump issued an executive order banning the use of paper straws in federal agencies.

Several employees at the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) responsible for election security have been placed on administrative leave, news agency Associated Press reported. This move affects critical support for state and local election offices across the country.Seventeen CISA employees who worked with election officials on cybersecurity, ransomware threats, and physical security have been placed on leave pending a review, news agency AP reported, quoting a source familiar with the situation. Ten of them are regional election security specialists who were hired to strengthen election security efforts ahead of the 2024 election. The review will examine efforts to counter foreign interference in US elections, which have been assigned to other staff members.These employees, all former state or local election officials, were brought in to build relationships across all 50 states and more than 8,000 local election jurisdictions. They spent the past year working with officials, attending conferences, and providing guidance on cybersecurity and physical security measures.State election officials from both political parties have defended CISA’s role. Kentucky secretary of state Michael Adams, a Republican, said CISA’s local staff had been especially helpful for county clerks.""The most value that we've got from CISA has been the people that they have on the ground in our state that build direct relationships, not just with us but with the individual county clerks,"" Adams said. ""They're teaching them and helping them check their physical security and their cyber hygiene, and that's been extremely popular.""Michigan secretary of state Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat, also supported CISA’s work.""And I hope that leaders in the federal government who claim to care about election integrity will recognize that,"" she was quoted as saying by news agency AP.The remaining employees placed on leave are current or former members of CISA’s election security and resilience team. The review is focused on the agency’s efforts to address misinformation and disinformation, as per the AP report. The ten regional election security specialists who worked with state and local officials were part of CISA’s field operations division.The personnel changes come amid criticism from some Republican officials. Kristi Noem, President Donald Trump’s new homeland security secretary, said during her Senate confirmation hearing that CISA had strayed ""far off mission"" and pledged to work with senators ""should you wish to rein them in.""Trump has not named a replacement for former CISA director Jen Easterly. CISA officials were also absent from recent meetings of state election officials in Washington, DC.CISA was established in 2018 during Trump’s presidency and is responsible for protecting critical infrastructure, including voting systems.

Pakistani lawyers stage protest against high-level meeting of constitutional body to pick eight SC judges,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistani-lawyers-stage-protest-against-high-level-meeting-of-constitutional-body-to-pick-eight-sc-judges/articleshow/118118105.cms,"Representative image (Image credits: ANI)

ISLAMABAD: Hundreds of lawyers on Monday staged protests in Pakistan's national capital against a high-level meeting of a constitutional body with the agenda to appoint at least eight judges of the supreme court. The judicial commission of Pakistan (JCP) meeting was being held despite opposition by four apex court judges, the legal fraternity, resistance by opposition the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf and controversy over the recent transfer of judges to the Islamabad high court (IHC), which was opposed by five IHC judges.The JCP, a top body empowered to approve judicial appointments, will finalise appointments for eight vacant supreme court judges.Lawyers gathered at various locations in Islamabad, with the lawyers' action committee staging a protest near D-Chowk. But police responded by closing several key entry points to the Red Zone, which houses key buildings, including the supreme court.Dozens of protestors gathered at Serena Chowk as they were stopped from going to the supreme court due to the closure of the Red Zone. They chanted ""Azaadi"" (freedom) and ""Lawyers' unity zindabad"" (long live lawyers' unity). They were also holding a banner written in Urdu and reading "" 26th constitutional amendment unacceptable"".Clashes were also reported between lawyers and police when they tried to enter the Red Zone. However, there was no report of any arrest or injury during the protest.The protest led to the suspension of metro bus services on multiple routes between Islamabad and Rawalpindi, causing significant inconvenience for commuters. The closure of the Red Zone has caused traffic disruptions, leading to heavy congestion on different roads in the capital.Earlier, the legal fraternity in the country was already expressing concerns against the new appointments and transfers following the controversial 26th constitutional amendment passed last year.The lawyers' representatives had held a convention at the Islamabad district courts, opposing the 26th amendment and demanding the cancellation of the JCP meeting.They also announced on February 3 to protest against the transfer of three high court judges to the IHC but it could not elicit a widespread response. The Karachi bar association had supported the strike call by staying away.Last month, the Lahore high court bar association (LHCBA) moved an application before the apex court through advocate Muhammad Waqar Rana, seeking postponement of the JCP meeting.The JCP earlier this month asked all high courts to send a list of five senior judges from each for consideration for the appointment of eight of them to the supreme court.Initially, the IHC had forwarded the names of three judges - chief justice Aamer Farooq, justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani and justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb - to the JCP because justices Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri and Babar Sattar did not meet the minimum requirement of five years of service.However, as justice Sarfraz Dogar was made the IHC senior puisne judge following his transfer there from the Lahore high court, his name has also been sent to the JCP.Days before justice Dogar's name was added, five judges of the IHC approached chief justice Yahya Afridi and IHC chief justice Aamer Farooq to reclaim their seniority.Separately, four SC judges, senior puisne judge justice Mansoor Ali Shah, justice Munib Akhtar, justice Ayesha Malik and justice Athar Minallah, in a letter to the chief justice showed concerns last week and are also seeking the postponement of today's JCP session until a decision is made on the petitions against the 26th Amendment.The opposition PTI party in a letter to the chief justice on Sunday asked to postpone the commission's meeting.The 13-member JCP is led by the chief justice and includes four judges of the apex court, as well as parliamentarians from both the treasury and opposition and others.The lawyers and opposition allege that the government was trying to 'pack' the top judiciary with hand-picked judges to influence the fate of political cases, a concern rejected by the government.","Hundreds of lawyers stage protests in Islamabad against high-level meeting of constitutional body.

Policemen at the checkpost offered stiff resistance in an encounter which lasted two hours, following which the terrorists fled,” the provincial police said in a statement.Pakistan has experienced an escalation in militancy in KP, adjacent to Afghanistan, following the collapse of a tenuous truce between TTP and the state in Nov 2022.Pakistani authorities have linked the surge in militant violence to cross-border incursions from Afghanistan, alleging that the Kabul administration is facilitating TTP fighters, a claim Afghan authorities refute. Most of these assaults have been directed at security and law-enforcement personnel, although civilians and govt officials have also been impacted.In KP’s Dera Ismail Khan district last week, four soldiers were killed by gunfire and an improvised explosive device (IED) unleashed by terrorists.In Balochistan, another restive province in Pakistan’s south, 18 soldiers were killed in an attack by terrorists earlier this month.Islamabad think-tank Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) has described 2024 as the most lethal year for security forces in a decade, with a minimum of 685 military and police fatalities resulting from 444 terror attacks.Alongside such attacks, militants have stepped up targeted killings and kidnappings of officials in KP and Balochistan.","Nearly a dozen militants stormed a police check post at Karak district in Pakistan’s restive northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province.

ISLAMABAD : The UN refugees and migration agencies on Wednesday expressed their concern over Pakistan 's decision to deport thousands of Afghan refugees awaiting relocation to the United States and elsewhere.The UN refugee agency, UNHCR , and the international organization for migration in a statement said they were seeking clarification from Pakistan, which said last week it would deport the refugees back to Afghanistan unless their cases were processed quickly by the countries that had agreed to take them in.About 20,000 Afghans were approved for resettlement in the US under a program that helps people at risk because of their work with the American government, media, aid agencies and rights groups. They were among tens of thousands of Afghans who fled to neighboring Pakistan after their country fell to the Taliban in 2021.However, they were left in limbo after President Donald Trump paused US refugee programs last month.""A UNHCR-issued non-return advisory has been in place since 2021, calling for a suspension of forced returns of Afghan nationals from any country regardless of their status,"" the joint UNHCR-IOM statement said.Pakistan's prime minister Shehbaz Sharif last week gave the green light to evict Afghans without papers from the cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi before March 31, in preparation for deportation if they were not relocated to their host countries.UNHCR and IOM said they are especially concerned for Afghan nationals who face a risk of harm upon return, such as ethnic and religious minorities, women and girls, journalists, human rights activists, and members of artistic professions like musicians and others.It said since January 1, 2025, an uptick in arrests of Afghan nationals in Islamabad and Rawalpindi has caused significant distress, with reports of Afghan nationals of various documentation statuses being rounded up.The Trump administration also announced the US refugee admissions program would be suspended from January 27 for at least three months. It has shocked Afghans who were hoping to travel to the United States soon.Afghans in Pakistan have been virtually living in hiding since 2023 when a crackdown began on foreigners who are in the country without proper documentation. An estimated 800,000 Afghans have either gone back voluntarily or been deported since despite criticism from UN agencies, rights groups and the Taliban.Besides thousands of Afghans who are living in Pakistan and awaiting travel to host countries, there are around 1.45 million Afghan nationals registered with UNHCR as refugees in Pakistan as well but their stay has been extended until June.In the statement, UNHCR and IOM urged ""Pakistan to implement any relocation measures with due consideration for human rights standards, including due process, and the legal status of proof of registration (POR) and afghan citizen card (ACC) holders, who have resided in Pakistan for an extended period of time"".""Pakistan has a proud tradition of hosting refugees, saving millions of lives. This generosity is greatly appreciated,"" UNHCR representative in Pakistan Philippa Candler said.""IOM is committed to work with the government of Pakistan and UNHCR to develop a mechanism to register, manage and screen Afghan nationals in Pakistan,"" said IOM chief of mission, Mio Sato.She said ""This will open the door to tailored solutions including international protection to those in need and pathways for Afghan nationals, with long-standing socioeconomic and family ties in the country.""","UN refugees and migration agencies express concern over Pakistan's decision to deport thousands of Afghan refugees.

Local authorities increased security following the deaths of two Chinese nationals in a bomb attack last year.Pakistan hosts thousands of Chinese workers as part of Beijing's multibillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative, which is building major infrastructure projects. Several Chinese companies have also been set up across the country.Two Chinese nationals were killed in Karachi in October when a suicide bomber targeted their vehicle outside an airport.

ISLAMABAD: President Asif Ali Zardari will travel to China on Tuesday on a five-day state visit during which he will discuss a broad spectrum of bilateral relations with the Chinese leaders, with a focus on economic and trade cooperation, security collaboration , and the multi-billion dollar economic corridor (CPEC). The foreign office said on Monday that President Zardari, who is visiting Beijing at the invitation of his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping , will hold high-level meetings with the president, premier Li Qiang, and other senior officials.Their ""discussions will encompass the full spectrum of Pakistan-China relations, with a particular focus on economic and trade cooperation; counter-terrorism and security collaboration, China-Pakistan economic corridor (CPEC) and future connectivity initiatives,"" state-run radio Pakistan quoted the foreign office as saying.The two sides will also exchange views on regional and global geopolitical developments and cooperation in multilateral forums, it added.The CPEC, which connects Gwadar Port in Pakistan's Balochistan with China's Xinjiang province, is the flagship project of China's ambitious Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).

PESHAWAR: The Pakistani Taliban claimed the killing of a police officer as he travelled Monday to guard polio vaccinators on the first day of a nationwide immunisation effort after a year of rising cases.The officer was travelling to guard polio vaccinators in the area of Jamrud town in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province when he was killed, local police official Zarmat Khan told AFP.""Two motorcycle riders opened fire on him,"" he said. ""The constable died instantly at the scene."" Pakistan and neighbouring Afghanistan are the only countries where polio is endemic and militants have for decades targeted vaccination teams and their security escorts.The Pakistani Taliban in a statement claimed responsibility for the ""targeted attack"" and said militants also ""seized"" the slain officer's weapon.Pakistan reported at least 73 polio infections in 2024, compared to just six cases in 2023. The vaccination campaign which started on Monday is the first of the year and is due to last a week.""Despite the incident, the polio vaccination drive in the area remains ongoing,"" Khan said.Abdul Hameed Afridi, another senior police official in the area, also confirmed details of the attack and said officers have ""launched an investigation"".Prime minister Shehbaz Sharif acknowledged the violence in a statement from his office, saying ""the anti-polio campaign will continue with full vigour"".Polio can easily be prevented by the oral administration of a few drops of vaccine, but scores of vaccination workers and their escorts have been killed over the years.In the past, clerics falsely claimed that the vaccine contained pork or alcohol, declaring it forbidden for Muslims.In more recent years the attacks have focused on vulnerable police escorts accompanying the vaccinators as they go door-to-door.Last year, dozens of Pakistani policemen who accompany medical teams on campaigns went on strike after a string of militant attacks targeting them.Pakistan has witnessed rising militant attacks since the Taliban returned to power in neighbouring Afghanistan.More than 1,600 people were killed in 2024, the deadliest year in almost a decade, according to the center for research and security studies, an Islamabad-based analysis group.Islamabad accuses Kabul's new rulers of failing to rout militants organising on Afghan soil, a charge the Taliban government routinely denies.In November, at least seven people including five children were killed in a bombing targeting police gathered to guard vaccinators near a school in southwestern Balochistan province.Balochistan, which also neighbours Afghanistan, was the area with the largest number of polio cases in 2024, despite being the most sparsely populated.",The officer was travelling to guard polio vaccinators in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

Pakistani troops fought insurgents who set up roadblocks in the restive northwestern region of Balochistan, leaving 18 paramilitaries and 23 rebels dead, officials said on Saturday. Three other Pakistani soldiers were seriously wounded in some of the heaviest clashes in recent years.The onslaught was claimed by the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), a militant organization behind rising violence in the Balochistan province that borders Afghanistan and Iran.A vehicle carrying unarmed border troops ""came under gunfire from 70 to 80 armed assailants who had blocked the road,"" a police official told the AFP news agency. The official was speaking on the condition of anonymity.The Pakistani military said the casualties occurred after troops engaged the insurgents who erected barricades on a key highway in Kalat, near the border with Afghanistan.The security forces ""successfully removed the roadblock"" following the overnight clashes, the military said in a statement.The military confirmed 18 soldiers died in the operation and vowed that ""the perpetrators, facilitators and abettors of this heinous and cowardly act, will be brought to justice."" Security forces recovered the bodies of 12 insurgents, the military said.Troops also killed another 11 insurgents in an operation that was still underway, the military added.Pakistan's Balochistan province is currently witnessing a surge in deadly attacks, fueled by demands for independence and control over local resources.A Sunni Muslim ethnic group who live on both sides of the Iran-Pakistan border, and also in parts of southern Afghanistan, over 10,000 Baloch have disappeared since 2011, according to Amnesty International.Efforts for autonomy or independence have been met with violent suppression on both sides of the border. In Pakistan, such efforts are viewed as attempts to fragment the nation — while in Iran the situation is further complicated by the Baloch being a Sunni Muslim minority in a predominantly Shiite country.The largest Baloch militant group, the BLA, is backed by the Pakistani Taliban, also known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).The TTP are a separate group from the BLA, with the TTP being allied with the Afghan Taliban.Balochistan is rich in natural resources such as gold, diamonds, silver, and copper — yet the local population remains among the poorest in Pakistan.","Pakistani troops fight insurgents who set up roadblocks in restive northwestern region of Balochistan. 18 paramilitaries and 23 rebels dead, three other Pakistani soldiers seriously wounded in some of the heaviest clashes in recent years.

He said one soldier of the Frontier Corps (FC), a paramilitary force, was separately killed in clashes with the militants.“The bodies of the slain soldiers were shifted to Quetta,” Shabbir said. “We don’t know how many attackers were killed because they took the bodies of their fighters into the mountains in the dark.”He said three FC personnel were also injured in the attack, adding that militants set a private bank on fire in Mangochar Bazaar.Separatist groups like BLA have long been at the forefront of a low-level insurgency in Balochistan, Pakistan's largest province by area and rich in mineral resources.

Legal barriers to Monkey trade

Nepali Congress lawmaker Ram Hari Khatiwada proposed selling monkeys to China to tackle the nation’s growing agricultural destruction caused by the simians.He suggested this solution during a parliamentary discussion on urgent public issues raised by the minister for forest and environment.Citing Sri Lanka's sale of monkeys to China, Khatiwada said that Nepal should also use a similar strategy to deal with the simian-problem.""The monkey menace has induced nationwide terror. Sri Lanka sold its monkey to China, earn revenue, manage the monkeys and send the harmful animal as well. Nepal's monkey, after being declared harmful, has there been any arrangement for its sale to China or not? In the Hilly areas, the residents are struggling hard due to the menace,"" Khatiwada said.This will also serve as a strategy to control the monkey threat that ravages the hilly part of Nepal.Nepal is home to three monkey species: the Rhesus macaque (), the Assamese monkey (), and the Hanuman langur ().As a signatory to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), Nepal must adhere to regulations on trading threatened species. Since rhesus monkeys are listed under CITES, their international trade is restricted.According to the act to regulate and control international trade in endangered wild fauna and flora, a person who is found guilty faces a sentence of five to fifteen years in prison or fined NRs 5,00,000 to NRs 1 million or bothThe national park and wildlife conservation act also lists the rhesus monkey as a protected species, restricting its export without government approval. However, the act does not outline any measures for managing protected animals that pose threats to people and agricultural production.","Lawmaker Ram Hari Khatiwada proposed selling monkeys to China to tackle the nation’s growing agricultural destruction caused by the simians.

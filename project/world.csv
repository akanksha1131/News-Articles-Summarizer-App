Why Marko Elez resigned from DOGE



Why JD Vance and Ro Khanna sparred on X



Who is Katherine Long? Why Elon Musk calls her disgusting



After Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) made headlines for recommending shutting down of USAID, DOGE became the headlines when its 25-year-old staff, Marko Elez resigned following the unearthing of his past social media posts in which he called himself a racist. Those posts were not made in his name, but a pseudonym account which was suspended in December last year when Elez started to work for DOGE.This snowballed into a major controversy as little was known about DOGE so far but now that they started visiting federal agencies, bureaucrats claimed that they are mostly youngsters with questionable background and no eligibility to question federal workers. They are all ""tech kids"" who dropped out of college.Wall Street Journal reported that Marko Elez made several problematic posts in the past like: “Just for the record, I was racist before it was cool.”; “You could not pay me to marry outside of my ethnicity. Normalize Indian hate"" etc. Controversy over his past posts made him to resign, the Wall Street Journal said.Elon Musk ran a poll on X whether DOGE should rehire him and as the majority voters were in favor of Marko Elez, Musk said he would rehire him. But Musl admitted that Elez made some mistakes. ""To err is human,"" Musk wrote.Vice president JD Vance offered his opinion on Elon Musk's poll on Marko Elez and said he does not agree with what Elez wrote in past but he also believes that past social media activities should not ruin his life. Democrat Congressman Ro Khanna asked him whether he would seek an apology for the anti-India statement. ""Just asking for the sake of both of our kids,"" Ro Khanna wrote as their kids have Indian connection -- Ro Khanna is an Indian-American and JD Vance's wife Usha Vance has Indian origin.The 'children' part seemingly irked JD Vance and he took it as an emotional blackmail. ""I cannot overstate how much I loathe this emotional blackmail pretending to be concern. My kids, god willing, will be risk takers. They won't think constantly about whether a flippant comment or a wrong viewpoint will follow them around for the rest of their lives. They will tell stupid jokes. They will develop views that they later think are wrong or even gross. I made mistakes as a kid, and thank God I grew up in a culture that encouraged me to grow and learn and feel remorse when I screwed up and offer grace when others did,"" Vance wrote.Ro Khanna replied that he was only doing an exchange of ideas.Amid all this, journalist Katherine Long who wrote the Wall Street Journal piece on Marko Elez drew the ire of Elon Musk who called her disgusting.

Is DOGE working 120 hours a week?



Why is DOGE in controversy?



What is DOGE clock?



Donald Trump's crypto czar David Sacks has revealed in a podcast that DOGE staff have completely changed the work culture as they are working very late. The facilities people initially did not know what to do with them as they've never seen people working so late on a Friday night, David Sacks said as Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency is creating ripples -- for many reasons.Sharing an anecdote about DOGE, David Sacks said he went to greet them and the room was full of young people. ""I think they all are engineers. They were wearing suits and ties. They were working really late,"" Sacks said adding that new facilities access had to be created for them.Elon Musk recently said his team DOGE is working 120 hours a week. ""Our bureaucratic opponents optimistically work 40 hours a week. That is why they are losing so fast,"" Elon Musk wrote as he made it a DOGE vs bureaucracy fight as DOGE has been asked to cut the cost.DOGE was announced after Donald Trump won the election and between November to January 20, DOGE started working secretively. The meetings used to be held in Starlink offices. Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy were the two co-chiefs of the department. Ramaswamy exited DOGE to run for the governor election in Ohio. Now a complete Elon Musk show, DOGE gained prominence as they got an office in the White House. DOGE staff got access to the federal payments system. They are visiting agency offices and are asking federal employees to justify their jobs in 15 minutes. Elon Musk has already announced shutting down USAID, next on their anvil is the education department.Though DOGE has understandably many staff, four to five youngsters have gained prominence as they made those acrimonious visits to government offices. According to bureaucrats, all of them are youngsters aged between 19 to 25 years.DOGE has created a digital tracker that aims to monitor the amount of taxpayers' dollars that the departments saved. On Saturday, it showed the savings as $36.73 billion which is 1.8 per cent of their goal of two trillion that has to be achieved within 511 days.","Donald Trump's crypto czar David Sacks revealed in a podcast that DOGE staff have completely changed the work culture.

Trump's Immigration Policy Changes Could Impact Indian H-1B Visa Holders and Families,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/immigration-policy-changes-being-considered-by-trump-administration-may-hit-indians-on-green-card-queues-hard/articleshow/118013429.cms,"Poll Does Stricter U.S. Immigration Policy Violate Human Rights? No, It’s Necessary Yes, It’s Unfair

Several steps being considered by the administration of US President Donald Trump are cause for worry for thousands of Indians in the US, who are on H-1B work permits and face long green card backlog.First, the potential revocation of birthright citizenship, for which President Trump has signed an executive order, is a deeply concerning issue for Indian families on H-1B visas who are expecting children in the United States.While this policy is currently being challenged in court and remains on hold, its implementation—however unlikely—would have profound implications.One of the most significant challenges would be the increase in the number of “aging-out” children, who are not covered under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), and would lose the automatic legal status that US birthright citizenship provides. There are over 200,000 young immigrants, a large number of them Indians, who went to America with their parents as dependent children and then aged-out when they turned 21, according to estimates. They have to either self-deport, despite having lived in the US for several years and grown up and attended school and college there, or become undocumented immigrants.The issue of children aging out of dependent visa status is already one of the most challenging problems for Indian professionals on H-1B visas, and any policy change revoking birthright citizenship would only exacerbate it.“This would add further complexity to an already overburdened green card backlog, disproportionately affecting H-1B holders from India. Given the existing decades-long wait times for employment-based green cards, the inability to secure US citizenship at birth could leave these children in a precarious immigration status as they reach adulthood,” Neha Mahajan , co-founder of Skilled Immigrants in America (SIIA), an organisation supporting skilled Indians stuck in long green card queues, told the Times of India.The issue of birthright citizenship is currently being challenged in the US courts, and the executive order attempting to revoke it is on hold. Given the strong constitutional precedent supporting birthright citizenship under the 14th Amendment, any attempt to alter this long-standing principle is likely to face significant legal hurdles.Earlier this week, a federal judge in Seattle has indefinitely blocked President Trump’s executive order that seeks to end birthright citizenship. Historically, US courts have consistently upheld birthright citizenship, making it highly probable that this issue will remain tied up in litigation for an extended period. Any definitive change would require not just executive action but a constitutional amendment or a landmark Supreme Court ruling.“For now, the legal and constitutional precedent supporting birthright citizenship remains strong. However, any change to this principle would necessitate significant legislative and judicial battles, given its far-reaching consequences on immigrant communities and the broader US economy,” Mahajan said.Currently, children born in the United States to immigrant parents—whether on work visas or otherwise—are granted automatic US citizenship, providing a crucial safeguard against the severe green card backlog that disproportionately affects Indian H-1B holders. “This backlog, with decades-long wait times, leaves many high-skilled professionals in an uncertain immigration status for most of their careers. Birthright citizenship has been one of the few stabilising factors for their families,” Mahajan said. She added that the United States’ policy of birthright citizenship has historically set it apart from other developed nations, making it a more attractive destination for global talent.Another issue that could pose challenges for Indian professionals in the US, on H-1B visas, is the move to revoke employment authorisation documents for spouses of H-1B visa holders who are on dependent H-4 visas. “The H-4 EAD was introduced through an executive order by the Barack Obama administration after years of advocacy, providing much-needed relief and economic independence to many spouses of H-1B visa holders. However, under the administration of Trump’s first term, there was a concerted effort to revoke H-4 EADs, creating uncertainty and hardship for thousands of skilled immigrant women. Thanks to relentless advocacy—by organisations like SIIA and many women who chose to raise their voices—the effort to eliminate H-4 EADs was ultimately unsuccessful,” Mahajan said.She added that the broader immigration system has become increasingly difficult to navigate for Indians in the US who are waiting on green card queues. “Even routine H-4 EAD renewals have faced delays, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to employment disruptions and financial instability for many families from India, who already face disproportionately long wait times for permanent residency.”There are also fears now among Indian professionals, on temporary work visas in the US, on reversal of the Joe Biden administration’s order on automatic extension in certain categories of work permits. “These extensions were introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic to streamline the renewal process and prevent unnecessary employment disruptions. Any move to revoke automatic work permit extensions would have a significant impact on Indian professionals, particularly those on H-4 EADs,” Mahajan said. The automatic extensions allowed individuals to continue working while their renewal applications were pending, eliminating the need for additional biometrics appointments—a requirement that had been introduced under the earlier Trump administration.“Traditionally, H-1B and H-4 petitions were processed together, ensuring timely approvals. However, if the Trump administration issues new guidance to separate these filings, it could lead to increased delays in work authorisation extensions. This would disproportionately impact H-4 visa holders, many of whom are highly skilled professionals contributing to the US workforce,” Mahajan said.For Indian professionals already navigating decades-long green card wait time, these likely policy changes, being considered by the Trump administration, create additional uncertainty and financial instability.","Several steps being considered by the administration of US President Donald Trump are cause for worry for thousands of Indians in the US.

President Donald Trump is not interested in sending Prince Harry out of the country, pursuing his visa case because he thinks the ex-royal already has a lot of problems with his wife Meghan Markle. Trump did not like Harry and Meghan's exit from the royal family as Trump's allegiance lies with the late Queen who Trump said liked him.In an interview with the New York Post, Donald Trump said he would not pursue the case against Prince Harry.“I don’t want to do that,” he said. “I’ll leave him alone. He’s got enough problems with his wife. She’s terrible.”After stepping down from their royal duties, Harry and Meghan relocated to Los Angeles in 2020. After the release of Harry's memoir 'Spare' released where he admitted to having taken drugs like cocaine, cannabis and psychedelics in the past, questions were raised as to whether he mentioned this in his visa application or if he lied in his visa application because he should have been disqualified from getting a US visa.Heritage Foundation sued the Department of Homeland Security forcing to release Prince Harry's visa records. Harry won the case as the judge ruled that his visa records won't be released but it was apprehended that Donald Trump would pursue the case.Meghan Markle does not like President Trump and the feeling is mutual as Trump also, in pas, spoke negatively about Meghan. In 2022, Trump said he thinks Harry is ""whipped"". ""I'm not a fan of Meghan, I'm not a fan, and I wasn't right from the beginning. I think poor Harry is being led around by his nose,"" Trump said at that time.Rumors were rife that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle would end their marriage though later it was said that they would choose professional separation instead implying that they would concentrate on their individual work and make rare joint appearances though the California wildfires saw them together visiting relief centers.",Donald Trump said he won't deport Prince Harry as he believed Harry already has a lot of problems because of Meghan Markle.

A Controversy That Won’t Die

Poll Do You Think Politicians Should Speak Out More Against Hate Crimes? No, It’s a Complex Issue Yes, Silence Encourages Hate

JD Vance’s Response: Gaslighting or Genuine Belief?

The Hypocrisy: Why Wasn’t

Ramaswamy Given the Same Grace?

The Big Balls Moment: Musk’s Flippant Justification

When Black NFL players kneeled for the anthem, MAGA figures demanded permanent bans.

When liberal figures were “canceled” for offensive remarks, MAGA called for boycotts and firings.

When an Indian-American MAGA figure was removed, there was silence.

""Christ is King, not some stinky Indian idol.""

""Will there be a cow in the White House soon?""

The Takeaway: Who Gets to Be Forgiven?

Is there any true place for them in MAGA?

Are they only valued as token figures when convenient?

Would their loyalty ever be reciprocated?

The phrase “Normalize Indian Hate” was posted by Marko Elez, a former Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) employee whose racist social media history resurfaced last week. The revelation sparked a massive backlash, leading to Elez’s resignation. However, Elon Musk, with backing from Vice President JD Vance , reinstated Elez after a public poll on X.Vance’s defense of Elez—despite the blatant racism—has ignited outrage, particularly among Indian-Americans. Critics point to the hypocrisy in how Elez is treated compared to Vivek Ramaswamy , the Indian-American MAGA figure who was pushed out of DOGE without fanfare or second chances.This controversy highlights a deeper, uncomfortable truth. While MAGA claims to be an inclusive, meritocratic movement, it still harbors deep-seated biases against Indian-Americans—whether they are outsiders criticizing the right or insiders trying to fit in.Vance took to X (formerly Twitter) to dismiss concerns over Elez’s racist statements. Instead of addressing why he supported the return of someone who publicly advocated hate against Indians , he attacked critics for engaging in “emotional blackmail.”""For the sake of both of our kids? Grow up,"" Vance wrote. ""Racist trolls on the internet, while offensive, don’t threaten my kids. You know what does? A culture that denies grace to people who make mistakes. A culture that encourages Congressmen to act like whiny children.""Vance framed the backlash as part of a cancel culture overreach, ignoring the fact that Elez’s post explicitly targeted Indian-Americans—a group that includes his own wife and children.His dismissive stance infuriated social media users, who called him out for failing to defend his own family.Congressman Ro Khanna responded, saying, ""Are you going to tell him to apologize for saying ‘Normalize Indian hate’ before this rehire? Just asking for the sake of both of our kids.""Journalist Wajahat Ali added, ""Your wife is Indian American. Your kids are Indian American. Elez said he wants to ‘normalize Indian hate.’ Have some pride, man. Have some dignity. For your family's sake, you pathetic Reek.""Another user, Divya, criticized Vance’s privilege, stating, ""Easy for JD Vance to say this when his kids are covered by 24/7 security. What about regular Indian kids who have been rendered vulnerable because of the normalization of online hatred against Indians?""A well-known activist account, ind_us_immigrnt, pointed out the hypocrisy: ""Say ‘Normalize hate against White people’ and see how the MAGA clowns react.""While Elon Musk and JD Vance rallied to defend Elez, Vivek Ramaswamy—once considered MAGA’s rising star—was swiftly removed from his role in DOGE. Elez gets a poll, a second chance, and full public backing. Ramaswamy gets silence and a quiet exit.This double standard has infuriated Indian-American conservatives, many of whom now feel betrayed by a movement they once supported. The key question remains: Why is a white staffer, who openly promoted racism, given a second chance while an Indian-American leader is pushed aside?Harshil, an Indian-American commentator, pointed out, ""While Vivek Ramaswamy was deselected for DOGE, Elez has the backing of Vance for saying ‘Normalize Indian Hate.’ Indian-Americans, this is straight to your face. No matter how much you succeed, you will always be a second-class citizen.""Musk defended Elez’s return by citing forgiveness, conducting a poll on X in which 78 percent of users voted to reinstate him.Shortly after the results, Musk tweeted, ""He will be brought back. To err is human, to forgive divine.""Trump also chimed in, telling reporters, ""I’m with the Vice President.""However, this narrative of forgiveness crumbles when contrasted with MAGA’s past actions.The flippancy of how this issue was handled was best captured by David Sacks, who mocked the situation with this exchange:""Sir, the Pentagon has failed another audit.""""Send in Big Balls.""This level of casual arrogance over racism against Indian-Americans reinforces a harsh truth. Certain groups will always be prioritized within MAGA, while others remain expendable.The ‘Pagan Problem’: MAGA’s Uneasy Relationship With Indian-AmericansIndian-Americans like Usha Vance, Vivek Ramaswamy , and Sriram Krishnan have been prominent in MAGA’s political and business circles. Yet, their presence is often met with hostility from MAGA’s nativist and evangelical factions.An e arlier TOI report captured this underlying racism , highlighting online attacks against Usha Vance.Despite these overt attacks, MAGA leaders—including JD Vance himself—have largely ignored or downplayed the bigotry coming from within their own base. The underlying message is clear. Indian-Americans may be allowed in MAGA circles, but they will never be truly embraced.This controversy exposes the inherent contradictions within MAGA’s stance on race, meritocracy, and inclusion. If you are a white conservative who posts racist remarks, you get a poll, a second chance, and the full backing of Trump, Vance, and Musk. If you are an Indian-American conservative, you are disposable. The fallout from Marko Elez’s reinstatement and JD Vance’s dismissive response has left many Indian-Americans wondering:For now, Vance, Musk, and Trump have made their priorities clear. And for Indian-Americans watching from the sidelines, the lesson is stark. MAGA’s loyalty is conditional. And it does not extend to you.","The phrase “Normalize Indian Hate” was posted by Marko Elez, a former Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) employee whose racist social media history resurfaced last week.

WSJ said when they contacted White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt for a comment on Elez's past posts, Leavitt said Elez resigned from DOGE.His past posts included: “Just for the record, I was racist before it was cool.”; “You could not pay me to marry outside of my ethnicity.

Even JD Vance said Elez should not be victimized for his past social media activities which became another major controversy -- as Vance is married to Indian-origin Usha Vance and he did not call out the India hate.JD Vance said he ""obviously"" disagrees with some of Elez's posts but he also thinks that past social media activity should not ruin Elez's life. Indian-origin Democrat leader Ro Khanna took offence to Vance's stand and asked him whether Vance would seek an apology from Elez for his ""normalize Indian hate"" statement. ""Just asking for the sake of both of our kids,"" Ro Khanna wrote.""For the sake of both of our kids? Grow up,"" JD Vance said. ""Racist trolls on the internet, while offensive, don't threaten my kids. You know what does? A culture that denies grace to people who make mistakes. A culture that encourages congressmen to act like whiny children.""JD Vance called Ro Khanna's statement emotional blackmail. ""I don't worry about my kids making mistakes, or developing views they later regret. I don't even worry that much about trolls on the internet. You know what I do worry about, Ro? That they'll grow up to be a US Congressmen who engages in emotional blackmail over a kid's social media posts. You disgust me,"" Vance said.","Marko Elez is a 25-year-old lieutenant of Elon Musk who apparently resigned from DOGE. Trump said he was not aware of it but if Vice President JD Vance is in favor of rehiring the person, he is with the VP. Even JD Vance said Elez should not be victimized for his past social media activities.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118068909,imgsize-1532885,width-400,resizemode-4/118068909.jpg"

Why judge blocked DOGE team from treasury data



A US judge has issued an emergency order barring Elon Musk 's government reform team from accessing personal and financial data of millions of Americans stored at the treasury department , court documents revealed on Saturday.The order prohibited treasury officials from granting access to payment systems and sensitive financial records to ""all political appointees, special government employees, and government employees detailed from an agency outside the treasury department.""The temporary order, which will remain in effect until a scheduled hearing on February 14, also mandates that any such individuals who have already accessed treasury data since President Donald Trump's January 20 inauguration must ""immediately destroy any and all copies of material downloaded.""The name DOGE is reference to Elon Musk’s backing of dogecoin , a cryptocurrency originally created as a joke in 2021.Since President Trump’s January 20 inauguration, dogecoin’s value has dropped by nearly one-third.Trump established DOGE through an executive order last month, integrating it directly into the executive branch rather than as an external advisory body. The order also rebranded the US digital service, a White House unit focused on government technology projects within the office of management and budget (OMB), as the US DOGE service.“I am pleased to announce that the Great Elon Musk, working in conjunction with American Patriot Vivek Ramaswamy, will lead the department of government efficiency (DOGE),” Trump had declared.According to social media posts from Elon Musk, the task force is focused on identifying federal contracts and expenditures that contradict President Trump’s policy priorities, particularly in areas like DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) initiatives and foreign aid.""DOGE has now saved taxpayers over $1 billion in crazy DEI contracts,"" Musk had said last month.A coalition of 19 state attorneys general filed a lawsuit on Friday against Trump, the treasury department, and treasury secretary Scott Bessent, alleging that the administration illegally expanded access to sensitive treasury data for staff linked to Musk’s DOGE.In his Saturday ruling, the judge said that the states suing the administration would suffer ""irreparable harm"" without immediate court intervention. He cited two key risks: the potential exposure of sensitive and confidential information and an increased vulnerability of Treasury systems to hacking under the new policy.""That is both because of the risk that the new policy presents of the disclosure of sensitive and confidential information and the heightened risk that the systems in question will be more vulnerable than before to hacking,"" he wrote.Although Musk is neither a federal employee nor a government official, US media recently reported that he had been registered as a ""special government employee.""While DOGE lacks full departmental status—requiring Congressional approval—Musk and his team have aggressively pushed through federal agencies, freezing foreign aid, slashing budgets, and attempting mass layoffs within weeks of the new administration taking office.","A US judge has issued an emergency order barring Elon Musk's government reform team from accessing personal and financial data of millions of Americans. The temporary order, which will remain in effect until a scheduled hearing on February 14, also mandates that any such individuals who have already accessed treasury data must ""immediately destroy any and all copies of material downloaded""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118081743,imgsize-1157434,width-400,resizemode-4/118081743.jpg"

"In 2024, US seized 19kg of fentanyl from Canada border; 9,600kg from Mexico",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/in-2024-us-seized-19kg-of-fentanyl-from-canada-border-9600kg-from-mexico/articleshow/118080334.cms,"TORONTO: Canada's last-minute reprieve from crushing US tariffs came after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau unveiled a series of measures aimed at controlling the trafficking of fentanyl, a key reason President Donald Trump has cited for wanting to impose levies.Fentanyl has flooded North America's drug supply over the last decade, killing tens of thousands in Canada and the United States, and generating enormous profits for criminal organisations using basic chemistry skills, improvised equipment and home laboratories to produce millions of doses.(Fentanyl is synthetic, means it can be made easily and cheaply in a lab, and is about 50 to 100 times stronger than many prescription opioids.)Trump has repeatedly talked about fentanyl as a major public health threat to Americans and holds Mexico and Canada responsible for allowing the drug to enter the US. But last year, less than 1% of the fentanyl arriving in the US came from Canada.The number of organised crime groups making fentanyl in Canada keeps growing, and Canadian officials have uncovered links between Mexican drug cartels and some domestic crime groups involved in the drug's production.In the last six years, Canadian police have dismantled 47 fentanyl labs, including the largest ever last year in British Columbia, govt officials said. That lab had enough material to produce 96 million opioid doses.Last year, about 19kg of fentanyl was intercepted at the Canada-US border, compared with almost 9,600kg at the border with Mexico, where cartels mass-produce the drug, according to US Customs and Border Protection. One gram of powder fentanyl can fetch up to 240 Canadian dollars ($170) on the street, and pills can go for up to CA$40 ($28) each, according to Canadian police.Trump has said fentanyl seized at the northern border could kill 9.5 million Americans, but health experts have stayed away from defining a lethal dose of any opioid.Canadian fentanyl that arrives in the US tends to be sold on the dark web and shipped through the mail, Breton said. The issue of drug shipments in mailed packages focuses primarily on China.A trade rule known as de minimis allows companies to ship packages from China worth less than $800 without paying duties, taxes and fees, and their contents are subject to fewer inspections. Trump signed an executive order Saturday that removed the trade exemptions on those types of packages from China and Hong Kong.Canada's main drug export into the United States is MDMA, or ecstasy, according to a White House report in 2022 laying out the northern border counternarcotics strategy. In response to Trump's tariff threats, Canada said it would appoint a new ""fentanyl czar"" to oversee the country's efforts at the border.","Last year, less than 1% of the fentanyl arriving in the US came from Canada.

Investigation underway

Remains of all 10 recovered in Alaska plane crash : All you need to knowAuthorities have recovered the remains of all 10 victims from the fatal plane crash that occurred in western Alaska. The Nome volunteer fire department confirmed the recovery efforts on Saturday, racing against an approaching winter storm to retrieve the bodies from the icy Bering Sea.The crash involved a Bering Air single-engine turboprop plane travelling from Unalakleet to Nome.The aircraft disappeared Thursday afternoon and was discovered the following day, with all nine passengers and the pilot deceased.The tragedy marks one of the deadliest aviation incidents in Alaska in the past 25 years.The wreckage was found on a drifting ice floe moving approximately five miles per day, posing difficulties for rescue teams, according to National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Chair Jennifer Homendy.“Please know that we'll work diligently to determine how this happened with the ultimate goal of improving safety in Alaska and across the United States,” Homendy said during a press conference.A Black Hawk helicopter was deployed to assist with the recovery of the wreckage once the victims were removed. The National Weather Service had warned of an impending winter storm with snow and winds reaching up to 45 mph, further complicating recovery operations.Among those who perished were Rhone Baumgartner and Kameron Hartvigson, who had travelled to Unalakleet for work on a heat recovery system vital to the local water plant, as reported by the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium. “These two members of our team lost their lives serving others,” said David Beveridge, vice president of environmental health & engineering for the organization.The names of the other victims have not yet been released, but all ten individuals on board were adults. The flight was a routine commuter trip, confirmed Lt Ben Endres of the Alaska State Troopers.Radar data from the US Civil Air Patrol indicated that around 3:18 pm (local time) on Thursday, the aircraft experienced a sudden and rapid loss of altitude and speed. The exact cause remains unknown.Coast Guard Lt Cmdr Benjamin McIntyre-Coble stated that no distress signals were received from the aircraft. Normally, an emergency locating transmitter would signal authorities if exposed to seawater, but no such alerts were triggered.The NTSB has sent a team of investigators from multiple states to determine the cause of the crash.The crash has deeply affected the Nome community .As per the news agency AP, Mayor John Handeland expressed his grief, saying, “Nome is a strong community, and in challenging times, we come together and support each other. I expect the outpouring of support to continue in the coming days as we all work to recover from this tragic incident.”US Senator Lisa Murkowski also acknowledged the difficulty of the loss, stating, “It’s hard to accept the reality of our loss.”Bering Air, which operates flights across western Alaska, shared its condolences, “Our hearts are heavy with grief as we process this heartbreaking news. At this time, our thoughts are with the families and loved ones of those affected by this tragedy.”The company has set up a support line for relatives of those on board.With many Alaskan communities lacking road access, air travel is a lifeline for residents. Small planes are commonly used for commuting, cargo transport and even school sports travel.This incident follows two other major US aviation mishaps in the past eight days, a collision between a commercial jetliner and an Army helicopter near Washington, DC, that killed 67 people on January 29 and a medical transport plane crash in Philadelphia on January 31, which claimed seven lives.","The crash involved a Bering Air single-engine turboprop plane travelling from Unalakleet to Nome.

Donald Trumpo Harry Meghan: Did Donald Trump confirm Harry-Meghan divorce rumors? Here's what happened,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/did-donald-trump-confirm-harry-meghan-divorce-rumors-heres-what-happened/articleshow/118075531.cms,"President Trump said he would not deport Harry because he already has enough problems because of his wife Meghan Markle.

Donald Trump always hated Meghan Markle; his old video with Joe Morgan viral



Why could Harry be deported? What is the visa case?



President Donald Trump unwittingly dropped a major hint about the marital problems of Harry and Meghan Markle as he, in an interview with the New York Post, said he has no interest in pursuing the visa case against Harry. ""I'll leave him alone. He's got enough problems with his wife. She's terrible,"" Donald Trump said without naming Meghan Markle.A lot has been discussed about Harry and Meghan's marriage problems with insiders claiming that they are on the verge of a divorce.Vanity Fair did a cover story about the ex-royals in which they claimed that Meghan Markle was approached to write a ""post-divorce"" book though there was no such scenario on the horizon. Then there were speculations that they were separating their professional lives -- with Meghan Markle focussing on her shows and entrepreneurial works and Harry remaining busy with his philanthropic works. But Harry and Meghan made several joint appearances since then -- they visited relief centers in Los Angeles to help the fire victims; they appeared together to launch the Invictus Games in Vancouver Saturday.In 2022, Donald Trump spoke about Harry and Meghan on the Piers Morgan show and said he was never a fan of Meghan Markle.""I'm not a fan of Meghan, I'm not a fan, and I wasn't right from the beginning. I think poor Harry is being led around by his nose.,"" Trump said in the old interview.""Do you think it's going to end?"" Piers Morgan asked. ""I do, I've been a very good predictor, as you know, I've predicted almost everything, it'll end, and it'll end bad,"" the former president replied. ""I wonder if Harry's going to go back on his hands and knees and say please. You know, I think Harry's been led down a path.""""I would, the only thing I disagree with the Queen on, probably one of the only things ever, is that I think she should have said, 'If that's your choice fine, but you no longer have titles and frankly don't come around,'"" Trump said. ""He has been so disrespectful to the country and I think he's an embarrassment.""After stepping down as royals, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle settled in the US, in Montecito. After Harry's memoir Spare was published, he was accused of lying in his visa form as in his book, he admitted to taking marijuana, cocaine, and psychedelic drugs. Every US visa applicant has to give information about their drug history. Either Harry lied about drugs in the form or he was given preferential treatment, the lawsuit claimed demanding Harry's visa records. But the judge ruled in favor of Harry that his visa records would remain private. Donald Trump could have pursued the case and Harry-Meghan reportedly expected that but Trump said he would leave Harry alone.","President Trump said he would not deport Harry because he already has enough problems because of his wife Meghan Markle.

Not only Democrat Congressman Ro Khanna who dragged JD Vance's children to the debate, the vice president was asked by social media users why he did not feel any rage against the person's India-hatred while he is married to a woman of Indian descent.JD Vance said he did not agree to Marko Elez's posts but he does not believe that past social media activities should ruin his life. Elon Musk agreed and announced that he would bring him back as ""to err is human"".Journalist Zaid Jilani opined that firing him from DOGE for his past posts does not mean his whole life would be ruined; it just means that he does not have the professionalism to be a high-level government staffer. ""Maybe if the staffer is a ""kid"" and doesn't know any better, they should take a time out and grow up before they seek a job like that,"" Jilani wrote.JD Vance replied to Jilani and blamed how the issue has been treated with so much seriousness like Marko Elez is a cabinet secretary. ""First of all, he's a staffer. There are many layers between him and the President of the United States. people act like he's a cabinet secretary,"" the VP said.Blaming Wall Street Journal for playing it up, Vance said, ""The WSJ and others made his name a national news story. He's now the object of 10 seconds of hate from maladjusted leftwingers. They are explicitly trying to ruin his life.""A Wall Street Journal report linked Marko Elez to some now-deleted social media posts like: ""Just for the record, I was racist before it was cool""; ""I would not mind at all if Gaza and Israel were both wiped off the face of the Earth""; ""You could not pay me to marry outside of my ethnicity"", ""Normalize Indian hate"" etc.","JD Vance said he did not agree to Marko Elez's posts but he does not believe that past social media activities should ruin his life.

US edging towards constitutional crisis as Dem state courts block Trump action,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-edging-towards-constitutional-crisis-as-dem-state-courts-block-trump-action/articleshow/118071519.cms,"TOI correspondent from Washington

: The first contours of a constitutional crisis and a potential civil war, at least on the legal front, are sharpening in America. A federal judge in New York issued an emergency order on Saturday prohibiting Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency from accessing personal and financial data of millions of Americans kept at the Treasury Department, after Attorneys General from 19 Democrat-run states sued to stop the intrusion.Initiated by New York AG Letitia James, the attorneys general said the president had given “virtually unfettered access” to the federal government’s most sensitive information Musk's young DOGE aides who are now “attempting to access government data to support initiatives to block federal funds from reaching certain disfavored beneficiaries.”Separately, another federal judge issued a restraining order pausing the administrative leave of 2200 USAID employees and the withdrawal nearly all of the agency’s overseas workers, as the US legal system kicked in to constrain the Trump effort to dismantle the traditional norms of governance the President sees as deeply flawed and corrupt.Other court rulings this week have blocked Trump moves to freeze federal spending and overturn birthright citizenship, even as the President is expanding his blitz against Democrats with what his supporters characterize as a ""flood the zone"" policy aimed at overwhelming them on many fronts.On Friday, Trump announced, among other steps, that he is sacking members of the board of trustees for the storied Kennedy Centre in Washington DC and naming himself chairman. Maintaining that the current trustees ""do not share our Vision for a Golden Age in Arts and Culture,"" Trump smacked down on the center recently featuring ""Drag Shows specifically targeting our youth,"" and asserted, ""THIS WILL STOP.""Opening new fronts almost every hour, Trump also fired the head of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), Colleen Shogan, a Biden-appointee and the first woman to serve in the post. The President has reportedly been miffed by the agency’s role in the Justice Department’s investigation and prosecution over classified documents kept at his Mar-a-Lago home after his first term, although Shogan was not in charge at the time.For that matter, Trump extended his pique against the former President himself, revoking Biden's security clearance and classified briefings in a payback for what Biden had done to him.Fired up by a MAGA base celebrating the dismantling of what it sees as the entrenched establishment in Washington DC, Trump acolytes virtually defaced the USAID lettering stenciled in granite at the entrance of its HQ, cheered on by Elon Musk, who also celebrated with an ""RIP"" message the demise of the Consumer Forum Protection Board (CFPB), whose head Rohit Chopra was fired by Trump earlier this week.So intense and vitriolic is the resentment and pressure from the base towards the establishment that the Trump dispensation is avoiding any reminders about USAID being heartily backed during his first term by the President's own daughter Ivanka, and the Senator-turned Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who said the institution was vital to America's interests.The virtual sacking of long-established government institutions and programs is triggering alarms from Democratic lawmakers, liberal activists, and commentators about an ongoing coup and an upcoming constitutional crisis. Many are rushing to courts finding temporary reprieve and succor largely in Democratic-governed states amid a widening political schism in America.On Friday, the Washington Post, long an establishment sentinel whose current owner Jeff Bezos is now a Trump supporter, said the term constitutional crisis ""recalls some of the most perilous moments in American history, from the Civil War to Watergate."" Trump aides dismissed the talk as overheated and overblown.",A federal judge in New York issued an emergency order on Saturday prohibiting Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency from accessing personal and financial data of millions of Americans. Attorneys General from 19 Democrat-run states sued to stop the intrusion.

Policemen at the checkpost offered stiff resistance in an encounter which lasted two hours, following which the terrorists fled,” the provincial police said in a statement.Pakistan has experienced an escalation in militancy in KP, adjacent to Afghanistan, following the collapse of a tenuous truce between TTP and the state in Nov 2022.Pakistani authorities have linked the surge in militant violence to cross-border incursions from Afghanistan, alleging that the Kabul administration is facilitating TTP fighters, a claim Afghan authorities refute. Most of these assaults have been directed at security and law-enforcement personnel, although civilians and govt officials have also been impacted.In KP’s Dera Ismail Khan district last week, four soldiers were killed by gunfire and an improvised explosive device (IED) unleashed by terrorists.In Balochistan, another restive province in Pakistan’s south, 18 soldiers were killed in an attack by terrorists earlier this month.Islamabad think-tank Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) has described 2024 as the most lethal year for security forces in a decade, with a minimum of 685 military and police fatalities resulting from 444 terror attacks.Alongside such attacks, militants have stepped up targeted killings and kidnappings of officials in KP and Balochistan.","Nearly a dozen militants stormed a police check post at Karak district in Pakistan’s restive northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province.

ISLAMABAD : The UN refugees and migration agencies on Wednesday expressed their concern over Pakistan 's decision to deport thousands of Afghan refugees awaiting relocation to the United States and elsewhere.The UN refugee agency, UNHCR , and the international organization for migration in a statement said they were seeking clarification from Pakistan, which said last week it would deport the refugees back to Afghanistan unless their cases were processed quickly by the countries that had agreed to take them in.About 20,000 Afghans were approved for resettlement in the US under a program that helps people at risk because of their work with the American government, media, aid agencies and rights groups. They were among tens of thousands of Afghans who fled to neighboring Pakistan after their country fell to the Taliban in 2021.However, they were left in limbo after President Donald Trump paused US refugee programs last month.""A UNHCR-issued non-return advisory has been in place since 2021, calling for a suspension of forced returns of Afghan nationals from any country regardless of their status,"" the joint UNHCR-IOM statement said.Pakistan's prime minister Shehbaz Sharif last week gave the green light to evict Afghans without papers from the cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi before March 31, in preparation for deportation if they were not relocated to their host countries.UNHCR and IOM said they are especially concerned for Afghan nationals who face a risk of harm upon return, such as ethnic and religious minorities, women and girls, journalists, human rights activists, and members of artistic professions like musicians and others.It said since January 1, 2025, an uptick in arrests of Afghan nationals in Islamabad and Rawalpindi has caused significant distress, with reports of Afghan nationals of various documentation statuses being rounded up.The Trump administration also announced the US refugee admissions program would be suspended from January 27 for at least three months. It has shocked Afghans who were hoping to travel to the United States soon.Afghans in Pakistan have been virtually living in hiding since 2023 when a crackdown began on foreigners who are in the country without proper documentation. An estimated 800,000 Afghans have either gone back voluntarily or been deported since despite criticism from UN agencies, rights groups and the Taliban.Besides thousands of Afghans who are living in Pakistan and awaiting travel to host countries, there are around 1.45 million Afghan nationals registered with UNHCR as refugees in Pakistan as well but their stay has been extended until June.In the statement, UNHCR and IOM urged ""Pakistan to implement any relocation measures with due consideration for human rights standards, including due process, and the legal status of proof of registration (POR) and afghan citizen card (ACC) holders, who have resided in Pakistan for an extended period of time"".""Pakistan has a proud tradition of hosting refugees, saving millions of lives. This generosity is greatly appreciated,"" UNHCR representative in Pakistan Philippa Candler said.""IOM is committed to work with the government of Pakistan and UNHCR to develop a mechanism to register, manage and screen Afghan nationals in Pakistan,"" said IOM chief of mission, Mio Sato.She said ""This will open the door to tailored solutions including international protection to those in need and pathways for Afghan nationals, with long-standing socioeconomic and family ties in the country.""","UN refugees and migration agencies express concern over Pakistan's decision to deport thousands of Afghan refugees.

PESHAWAR: The Pakistani Taliban claimed the killing of a police officer as he travelled Monday to guard polio vaccinators on the first day of a nationwide immunisation effort after a year of rising cases.The officer was travelling to guard polio vaccinators in the area of Jamrud town in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province when he was killed, local police official Zarmat Khan told AFP.""Two motorcycle riders opened fire on him,"" he said.

Rich in resources but poverty is rife

Pakistani troops fought insurgents who set up roadblocks in the restive northwestern region of Balochistan, leaving 18 paramilitaries and 23 rebels dead, officials said on Saturday. Three other Pakistani soldiers were seriously wounded in some of the heaviest clashes in recent years.The onslaught was claimed by the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), a militant organization behind rising violence in the Balochistan province that borders Afghanistan and Iran.A vehicle carrying unarmed border troops ""came under gunfire from 70 to 80 armed assailants who had blocked the road,"" a police official told the AFP news agency. The official was speaking on the condition of anonymity.The Pakistani military said the casualties occurred after troops engaged the insurgents who erected barricades on a key highway in Kalat, near the border with Afghanistan.The security forces ""successfully removed the roadblock"" following the overnight clashes, the military said in a statement.The military confirmed 18 soldiers died in the operation and vowed that ""the perpetrators, facilitators and abettors of this heinous and cowardly act, will be brought to justice."" Security forces recovered the bodies of 12 insurgents, the military said.Troops also killed another 11 insurgents in an operation that was still underway, the military added.Pakistan's Balochistan province is currently witnessing a surge in deadly attacks, fueled by demands for independence and control over local resources.A Sunni Muslim ethnic group who live on both sides of the Iran-Pakistan border, and also in parts of southern Afghanistan, over 10,000 Baloch have disappeared since 2011, according to Amnesty International.Efforts for autonomy or independence have been met with violent suppression on both sides of the border. In Pakistan, such efforts are viewed as attempts to fragment the nation — while in Iran the situation is further complicated by the Baloch being a Sunni Muslim minority in a predominantly Shiite country.The largest Baloch militant group, the BLA, is backed by the Pakistani Taliban, also known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).The TTP are a separate group from the BLA, with the TTP being allied with the Afghan Taliban.Balochistan is rich in natural resources such as gold, diamonds, silver, and copper — yet the local population remains among the poorest in Pakistan.","Pakistani troops fight insurgents who set up roadblocks in restive northwestern region of Balochistan. 18 paramilitaries and 23 rebels dead, three other Pakistani soldiers seriously wounded in some of the heaviest clashes in recent years.

Bilal Shabbir, Kalat’s deputy commissioner, said the attacks took place in Pidrang, Khazeni and Mangochar Bazaar areas of the town, where militants started conducting snap checks of passenger vehicles passing through town.In the first incident, Shabbir said a van carrying 17 soldiers from Panjgur to Quetta came under attack near the mountainous area of Khazeni, where armed men battled the security forces. He said one soldier of the Frontier Corps (FC), a paramilitary force, was separately killed in clashes with the militants.“The bodies of the slain soldiers were shifted to Quetta,” Shabbir said. “We don’t know how many attackers were killed because they took the bodies of their fighters into the mountains in the dark.”He said three FC personnel were also injured in the attack, adding that militants set a private bank on fire in Mangochar Bazaar.Separatist groups like BLA have long been at the forefront of a low-level insurgency in Balochistan, Pakistan's largest province by area and rich in mineral resources. Separatists claim that Islamabad is abusing the province’s natural wealth while ignoring the local population.In recent months, the BLA has become a major security threat, carrying out large-scale attacks in Balochistan and other parts of Pakistan, targeting Chinese nationals and interests engaged in investment projects, security forces, and ethnic Punjabis they perceive as outsiders in Balochistan.",At least 18 soldiers killed and five injured in Balochistan attacks.

Eighteen paramilitary personnel were killed and three others seriously wounded in an ambush in southwest Pakistan's Balochistan province, local officials confirmed on Saturday.The attack took place near the town of Mangochar, where a vehicle ""carrying unarmed Frontier Corps personnel"" was intercepted by 70 to 80 heavily armed assailants who had blocked the road, a police official told AFP on condition of anonymity.The gunmen opened fire, killing 17 of the passengers on board. A paramilitary who arrived to assist was also killed in the attack.Three others were critically injured, while two managed to escape unscathed.No group has claimed responsibility for the attack so far, but Balochistan has long been plagued by sectarian, ethnic, and separatist violence.The province, which borders Afghanistan and Iran, has seen a surge in attacks in recent months.In January, six people were killed in a bombing claimed by the separatist Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), which has frequently targeted security forces and civilians, particularly those from other provinces.The BLA has also attacked foreign-funded energy projects, including those backed by China, accusing outsiders of exploiting the province’s vast natural resources while neglecting local communities.In November, the BLA took responsibility for a bombing at Quetta’s main railway station that killed 26 people, including 14 soldiers. Just months earlier, in August, the group launched a series of coordinated attacks that left at least 39 people dead, marking one of the deadliest escalations in recent years.Violence has also surged beyond Balochistan, with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province witnessing an increase in militant attacks.The Pakistani military reported that in 2024 alone, 383 soldiers and 925 militants were killed in various clashes.","18 paramilitary personnel killed in ambush in southwest Pakistan's Balochistan province.

In Aug 1975, Mujibur Rahman, his wife and three brothers were assassinated in the house, which was turned into the Bangabandhu Memorial Museum. Murals and busts of Mujibur have also been demolished or defaced across the country.""Respecting the rule of law is what differentiates the new Bangladesh we are working together to build from the old Bangladesh under the fascist regime. Let us not undermine Bangladeshis' sense of security and stability; any disregard for the law endangers the lives and property of citizens,"" Yunus said.For citizens who rose up and overthrew the Hasina regime in July-Aug last year to realise their dreams for the country, it is imperative to ""prove to ourselves and our friends around the world our commitment to our principles..."", the statement said. The leaders of the fascist regime have left the country in complete ruins, it said, adding ""the govt will bring the responsible individuals and groups to justice"".","Bangladesh chief adviser Muhammad Yunus responded to the destruction of the ancestral home of the country's founder Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.

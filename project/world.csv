Brics summit: China's Xi to skip summit for first time in 12 years; Gordon Chang hints at Jinping's losing influence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/brics-summit-chinas-xi-to-skip-summit-for-first-time-in-12-years-gordon-chang-hints-at-jinpings-losing-influence/articleshow/122275363.cms,"China's Xi Jinping to skip for first time in 12 years

South China Morning Post





Chinese President Xi Jinping will not attend the upcoming Brics Summit in Brazil, marking the first time in 12 years that the Chinese leader will be absent from the annual gathering of major emerging economies.The two-day summit, taking place in Rio de Janeiro on July 6-7, 2025, comes at a point when Xi’s absence is fueling speculation about internal political shifts in China.Gordon Chang, a noted expert on US-China relations, said Xi’s absence may reflect deeper troubles within China’s political hierarchy. “This is another hint that Xi Jinping is losing influence in China’s capital,” Chang posted on X.However China has attributed Xi’s no-show to a “scheduling conflict” and pointed to his earlier meeting this year with Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, as reported by the. In Xi’s place, Chinese Premier Li Qiang will lead the delegation, continuing a recent pattern of the Chinese President limiting his appearances on the global stage.Xi will not be the only high-profile absentee. Russian President Vladimir Putin, a close ally of Xi within the group, will participate only via video link. Brazil is a signatory to the International Criminal Court (ICC) over alleged war crimes in Ukraine and would be legally obliged to detain Putin were he to attend in person.The dual absence of Xi and Putin will shift spotlight on Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. PM Modi will attend both the Brics summit and is on a state visit to Brazil, positioning India as a central figure in this year’s summit.Brics, originally formed in 2009 with Brazil, Russia, India, and China and joined by South Africa in 2010, seeks to reassert itself as a counterbalance to the Group of Seven (G7). The bloc has recently expanded to include five new members — Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE — in a push to enhance its representation of the Global South.","Chinese President Xi Jinping will not attend the upcoming Brics Summit in Brazil.

16 killed in Pakistan building crash,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/16-killed-in-pak-building-crash/articleshow/122274775.cms,"



KARACHI: The death toll from a collapsed multi-story residential building in southern Pakistan rose to 16 as search operations to find survivors continued for the second day.Rescuers pulled 10 more bodies from the rubble during an overnight operation, officials said Saturday.The govt-run Civil Hospital said in a statement it had received the 16 bodies, adding several of the injured had been hospitalised. Rescue workers are using heavy machinery to search for at least eight more survivors believed to be trapped under the debris, said emergency officials.Residents said the building was located on a narrow street, hampering efforts to bring in additional heavy equipment. Television footage showed rescuers removing debris as relatives of those still trapped cried and prayed for the safety of their loved ones.Building collapses are common in Pakistan, where construction standards are often poorly enforced. Many structures are built with substandard materials, and safety regulations are frequently ignored to cut costs. In June 2020, an apartment building collapsed in Karachi, killing 22.","Rescuers pull 10 more bodies from the rubble during an overnight operation.

SYDNEY: Australian authorities on Saturday condemned what they said was an arson attack on a Melbourne synagogue with worshippers in the building, the latest in a spate of incidents against the nation's Jewish community.The fire at the entrance to the synagogue in the east of Victoria's state capital was sparked on Friday night, police said in a statement. Firefighters extinguished the blaze and there were no injuries to the 20 people inside.The attack, one of several recent anti-semitic incidents in Australia, comes seven months after another synagogue in Melbourne was targeted by arsonists who started a blaze that injured one and caused widespread damage.Victoria Premier Jacinta Allan on Saturday said it was ""absolutely appalling"" that a second Jewish synagogue had been attacked. ""Any attack on a place of worship is an act of hate, and any attack on a Jewish place of worship is an act of anti-Semitism,"" Allan said in a statement.Police said they believed the attack, in which flammable liquid was poured on the synagogue's front door and set alight, was carried out by a male suspect.He has not been identified but is thought to be white and aged in his 30s. There is ""no place in our society for anti-semitic or hate-based behaviour,"" police said.Alex Ryvchin, co-CEO of Executive Council of Australian Jewry, an umbrella group for Australia's Jews, said in a statement the fire was set as those inside sat down to Shabbat dinner. Authorities said they were probing if the attack was linked to an incident on Friday night at an inner-city restaurant in which one person was arrested for hindering police.

US deports 8 migrants to South Sudan: Legal challenges overruled by supreme court; critics call move unconstitutional,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-deports-8-migrants-to-south-sudan-legal-challenges-overruled-by-supreme-court-critics-call-move-unconstitutional/articleshow/122272686.cms,"US President Donald Trump (AP)





The Trump administration has deported eight migrants to South Sudan, a US department of homeland security official confirmed, after plans to initially send them to a base in Djibouti were called off.""A district judge cannot dictate the national security and foreign policy of the United States of America,"" assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin told ABC News. ""This Independence Day marks another victory for the safety and security of the American people.""The aircraft arrived in South Sudan shortly before midnight on Friday.The eight migrants, whom the department of homeland security alleges have serious criminal convictions, were previously involved in a lawsuit that temporarily halted their deportation to South Sudan, redirecting them instead to a US military base in Djibouti.According to court filings, conditions at the US military base in Djibouti were difficult for both the detainees and the ICE officials assigned to guard them.The case reached the US supreme court, which ruled in a 7-2 decision on Thursday that the Trump administration was not obligated to comply with a lower court order requiring the migrants to remain at the military facility while legal proceedings continued.The ruling marked another legal victory for the Trump administration in its ongoing effort to deport individuals to countries with which they have no direct ties, and where they could potentially face mistreatment.In an unsigned opinion, the US supreme court stated that, following its recent decision to remove judge-imposed due process requirements for third-country deportations, the government can no longer be held accountable for allegedly violating those protections.One of the attorneys representing the group of men described their deportation to South Sudan as “punitive and unconstitutional.”“Because of the supreme court's procedural ruling, these men were denied an opportunity to contest their deportations to South Sudan based on their fear of torture or death,” said Trina Realmuto in a statement to ABC News. “The US state department warns Americans against all travel to South Sudan, yet deported these men there without any due process. Make no mistake about it, these deportations were punitive and unconstitutional. ”",Eight migrants have been deported to South Sudan.

This includes personnel from the Texas National Guard and state troopers.Abbott declared a state of disaster for several counties in the Hill Country region, located about 70 miles north of San Antonio. On Saturday, he expanded the declaration to include additional counties affected by the flooding and formally requested federal assistance through a signed disaster declaration.W Nim Kidd, chief of the Texas division of emergency management, said Saturday afternoon that authorities are still ""actively searching"" for survivors, although he acknowledged that the mission ""will turn into recovery at some point.""""When you talk to the men and women that are up there in those helicopters and out in those boats and walking the ground, they're looking for live people right now and doing everything they can to continue to search as fast as possible,"" Kidd said at a press conference.Governor Abbott, also speaking at the briefing, emphasized that he has directed all state agencies involved in the efforts to ""assume everybody missing is alive"" and stressed that ""every minute counts.""More than 850 people have been rescued so far, many with the help of helicopters, according to officials.

The US President, however, did not name the countries. The President said the reciprocal tariffs would come into effect from Aug 1. ""The money is going to come to the United States from Aug 1,"" he added.Trump suggested that the letters would explain what the countries are going to be paying in tariff to the US. He said the lower limit in tariff could be in the range of 10-20% and the higher bracket would be in the range of 60-70%.Meanwhile, Japan's chief trade negotiator Ryosei Akazawa held two phone meetings with US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick to discuss tariffs as a July 9 deadline for higher levies nears.

Swept 32 km by Texas floods: Woman survives four dams and floating debris; rescued clinging to tree,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/swept-32-km-by-texas-floods-woman-survives-four-dams-and-floating-debris-rescued-clinging-to-tree/articleshow/122272142.cms,"Women clinging on to tree (@News4SA)





In a dramatic turn of events, a young woman was rescued after being swept nearly 32 km down the Guadalupe river and becoming trapped in a tree, following the devastating floods that struck parts of Texas, US, during 4th of July celebrations.According to KEN5S, the 22-year-old woman was discovered clinging desperately to the branches of a Cypress tree, several feet above the ground, as powerful floodwaters surged beneath her.The floods, which have claimed at least 27 lives so far, have also left dozens of young girls missing, prompting large-scale rescue and recovery operations.A homeowner in Center Point heard the woman’s cries for help and rushed to assist her, just in time. One of the tree branches had already broken off, and another was beginning to weaken when he spotted her.“I hear you, I see you,” the homeowner told the woman, as reported by the local television station.The man, whose identity was not disclosed, tried calling 911 but got no response, as the emergency hotline was overwhelmed due to the flooding.Instead, the man ran out to the street and flagged down first responders who were carrying out ongoing search and rescue operations.Rescue crews deployed boats to locate the woman, who had been stuck in the tree for several hours.By the time they reached her, the water level had receded by nearly 10 feet, leaving her no choice but to make a leap of faith from the tree into the rescue boat.The woman, whose identity has not been released, miraculously escaped with only minor scrapes and bruises, a remarkable outcome given that she was swept across four dams and narrowly avoided being hit by floating debris, including refrigerators and cars.She had been camping with her parents and other family members at a campground in Ingram when the rising river pulled her from her tent, according to KEN5SHer family attempted to flee in a vehicle, but it too was swept away by the powerful floodwaters.It remains unclear whether the woman’s family survived the flooding.So far, at least 25 people have been confirmed dead in the disaster, with dozens still reported missing.Among the confirmed fatalities are at least two young campers from Camp Mystic, a Christian sleepaway camp for girls aged between 7 and 17.","A 22-year-old woman was rescued after being swept 32 km down the Guadalupe river and trapped in a tree.

EU remains divided



Division into three categories



Limited deal amid divisions







The European Union is considering a temporary trade agreement with the United States that would maintain a 10 percent tariff on most exports, according to a briefing by the European Commission to EU ambassadors on Friday, reported news portal Politico.The update came after a key round of negotiations in Washington on Thursday, where EU trade commissioner Maroš Šefčovič aimed to defuse US President Donald Trump’s threat to impose a sweeping 50 percent tariff on all European imports starting July 9, if a deal is not reached.Talks will continue on potential exemptions for certain sectors, including the automotive industry, two national officials familiar with the discussions said, according to the news portal..However, the outcome was seen as underwhelming in several European capitals, especially after earlier signals from the Commission’s negotiating team that some industries could receive immediate tariff relief. The US currently imposes tariffs of 25 percent on cars and 50 percent on steel and aluminum imports.Despite intensive negotiations, reaching a consensus on a trade agreement with the United States remains challenging for European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, amid ongoing divisions among EU member states over how to proceed.According to three diplomats, all possibilities, including a failure to reach any deal, are still being considered.In a fresh twist, US officials have reportedly threatened to impose a 17 percent tariff on European food imports, two national officials confirmed, backing a report by the Financial Times.Von der Leyen is expected to hold one-on-one consultations with EU leaders over the weekend before deciding on the bloc's next steps, one official said.Meanwhile, Trump is likely to meet with his advisers on Monday, meaning any official announcement would be delayed until after those discussions.According to an EU diplomat, the European Commission expects President Donald Trump to classify America’s trade partners into three distinct groups.In the first category, countries where provisional agreements have been reached would see a continued pause on “reciprocal” tariffs, with the possibility of additional tariff relief later.The second category includes countries where no agreement has been reached; here, the country-specific tariffs announced by Trump in April, 20 percent in the EU’s case, would be reinstated while negotiations continue.In the third category, countries with stalled or unsuccessful talks would face higher tariffs, which would remain in place until further notice.Ursula von der Leyen paved the way for a minimal trade agreement on Thursday, stating her goal was to secure an “agreement in principle.” The move would follow a similar approach taken by the United Kingdom, which maintained a baseline tariff while securing exemptions for key sectors like automobiles and steel as broader negotiations continued.However, ahead of Friday’s briefing, several EU member states cautioned that such a deal would be unacceptable without a clear and immediate commitment from President Donald Trump to lift tariffs on critical industries.German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has pushed for a swift agreement, particularly to secure lower tariffs for Germany’s major export sectors. In contrast, countries including France, Spain, Italy, and Denmark have urged the Commission to negotiate a more comprehensive and balanced arrangement with Washington.Meanwhile, Brussels has kept a potential second wave of retaliatory tariffs, valued at €100 billion on hold, in an effort to give negotiations room to advance and to avoid escalating the ongoing transatlantic trade tensions.","The European Union is considering a temporary trade agreement with the United States that would maintain a 10 percent tariff on most exports.

Several lawmakers in Albany who describe themselves as socialists and progressives have access to considerable financial resources, despite advocating for policies centered on economic equality and wealth redistribution. Their well-funded positions highlight a growing presence of resource-rich progressive voices in New York politics.State Senator Liz Krueger, who advocated for “rent control for the rich” while claiming to support the middle class, holds nearly $24 million in investments, based on newly released 2024 financial disclosure statements.It’s unlikely that the progressive politician’s $142,000 annual salary as a state senator, a position she has held since 2002, is the sole source of her substantial wealth.Krueger’s father, Harvey, served as CEO of an investment bank that later merged with Lehman Brothers, where he went on to become vice chairman.The Ridgewood native, who once suggested New York should leave the “land of the free” and join Canada after President Trump’s election, may be even wealthier than reported, as state lawmakers aren’t required to disclose assets held in family-established trusts.Krueger, 67, who resides on Manhattan’s upper east side with her husband, a retired CUNY professor, holds a diverse portfolio of stocks and bonds, including nearly $8 million in Apple shares, according to the disclosures.Another progressive lawmaker, Lieutenant Governor Antonio Delgado, has nearly $1.1 million across various bank accounts.According to the filings, his wife, Lacey Schwartz Delgado, is an Emmy-nominated filmmaker and serves on multiple film boards.Delgado, sometimes referred to as “No Show Delgado” due to his reported absence from work on numerous occasions while serving as Governor Hochul’s $220,000-a-year deputy, is now seeking to succeed her.Meanwhile, socialist State Senator Jabari Brisport, an ally of mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani in Albany, previously joined AOC in criticizing capitalism.He sold his holdings in the cryptocurrency Ethereum last year to invest up to $250,000 in a “US Vegan Climate ETF.”Whereas some other disclosures revealed,Assemblymember Phara Souffrant Forrest, balances her role representing Brooklyn with a $50,000 part-time job as a registered nurse.

US President Donald Trump on Friday called the flash floods in Texas “terrible” and “shocking” as the death toll rose to 27, including 9 children, with dozens still missing following a powerful storm that swept through the Texas Hill Country overnight.""It's terrible, the floods. It's shocking,"" Trump told reporters, reacting to the devastation as emergency crews rushed to locate missing residents, including at least 24 girls from Camp Mystic, a Christian summer camp in Kerr County, which was completely destroyed by floodwaters.The Guadalupe River surged over 26 feet in just 45 minutes before dawn Friday, washing away cabins, homes, and vehicles. Kerr County Sheriff Larry Leitha said at least 240 people had been rescued, but many remain unaccounted for as search efforts continue using helicopters, boats, and drones.Crews worked through the early hours of Saturday, navigating debris and swift currents in the dark. “The water’s moving so fast, you’re not going to recognize how bad it is until it’s on top of you,” said Bob Fogarty, a National Weather Service meteorologist, reported AP.Frantic families posted photos of missing children, and a reunification center in Ingram saw tearful reunions as rescued campers arrived. “The camp was completely destroyed,” said 13-year-old Elinor Lester, one of the survivors.“A helicopter landed and started taking people away. It was really scary.”Some residents described having no warning before the flood hit. “We got no emergency alert. There was nothing,” said Matthew Stone. “Then a pitch black wall of death.”Despite claims from local officials that they didn’t anticipate such intense flooding, AccuWeather and the National Weather Service confirmed issuing warnings well before the storm hit. “These warnings should have provided officials with ample time to evacuate camps,” AccuWeather said.Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said alerts were sent but acknowledged that predicting the storm’s precise impact was difficult. “Everything was done to give them a heads up,” he said.More rain is expected through the weekend, with flash flood warnings still in effect.

A former supporter of Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has issued a strong warning to young New York City voters following socialist Zohran Mamdani ’s win in the Democratic primary.In a video posted on X, Lucy Biggers said,“If I was 25, I would’ve been obsessed with Zohran,”“Now I’m 35, and I’ve grown up. The feel-good promises of free college, free food, free housing might sound great, but they don’t work,” she added.She goes on to share her opinion that socialist policies drive wealthy residents away, making the cities poorer, leading to higher taxes for those who remain, with few benefits in return.Biggers, a media professional, says she played a key role in transforming AOC from a little-known figure into a political powerhouse in 2018.“I met AOC when she was basically a nobody. And I really thought she had something special going on, so I booked her for an interview at our studios,” Biggers told The New York Post.She created a viral video for the media outlet NowThis, which Ocasio-Cortez’s campaign eventually paid to promote on social media.“They downloaded it, and they used it as a campaign asset… they used it as a digital ad,” said Biggers, who now works with The Free Press as social media editor.Back in 2018, AOC sent shock waves across the American political landscape when she defeated 10-term incumbent Representative Joe Crowley in the Democratic primaries for the 14th Congressional district of New York. Later that November she went on to win the midterm elections.“The video got her message out. At that time, no one cared about AOC, she was not on cable news,” Biggers recalled.Seven years later, Biggers, now a mother of two and a homeowner in Connecticut, has started to see things differently.She said the pandemic and the effects of government spending were major turning points for her.“As you grow up, you start to see the world less black and white. You can’t sell this bill of goods that promises to create a utopia in America,” said Biggers, who works in the city.“There’s a glorification of socialism among young people. They don’t know what happened in Cuba, Venezuela, the USSR. They glamorize these countries and are indoctrinated into thinking the US is bad. It’s very naive… it’s embarrassing,” she said, talking about her own views back in time..She went on to add that while the voter enthusiasm for Mamdani is genuine, it's completely misguided.“It’s young people who want to make a change. And he ran a really great campaign honestly,” she said.“But I just think it’s selling a fantasy that ultimately doesn’t work.”","Lucy Biggers, 35, says she played a key role in transforming AOC from a little- known figure into a political powerhouse in 2018.

A large group of protesters opposing federal immigration enforcement filled downtown streets on Friday, July 4, turning a tense standoff with authorieties.Demonstrators gathered outside City Hall on Spring Street at about 9 am for what organisers called as a “march against ICE, federal occupation in downtown LA.”By 3 pm the march had reached the Edward R. Roybal Federal Building on Alameda Street, between Temple and Aliso Streets. The crowd remained outside the complex for three hours, chanting against recent immigration raids while flanked by Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officers, Customs and Border Protection personnel and US Marines.Tensions spiked when DHS declared an unlawful assembly. The Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) later posted on X, “Demonstrators are confronting Federal Protective Security Personnel and National Guard Members,” adding that federal agents had deployed less‑lethal munitions and urging residents to avoid the area.National Guard troops and federal agents formed a skirmish line, ordering protesters to disperse. When the crowd blocked several lanes of Alameda Street, LAPD issued a formal dispersal order at 7:05 pm. Most demonstrators left soon after.Police closed Alameda Street between First and Aliso Streets, and First Street between San Pedro and Alameda Streets, for roughly an hour to clear debris and restore traffic.Organisers said the march was a response to a series of immigration raids that began last month across the Los Angeles area. They also pointed to the Trump administration’s decision to deploy National Guard soldiers and Marines amid growing protests.","Demonstrators gathered outside City Hall on Spring Street at about 9 am for what organisers called as a “march against ICE, federal occupation in downtown LA” By 3 pm the march had reached the Edward R.

Revealed: This Trump Admin Official Ordered Weapons Supply Ban To Ukraine | Details





US President Donald Trump said Ukraine would need additional Patriot missile batteries for its air defences after a telephone conversation with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy, expressing disappointment at Russian President Vladimir Putin’s refusal to pursue a ceasefire.Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Friday, Trump described his call with Zelenskyy as “good” but contrasted it with his discussion with Putin a day earlier, which left him “very unhappy” because, he said, the Russian president showed no willingness to halt the fighting.On the question of Zelenskyy’s request for more Patriots, Trump replied, “They’re going to need them for defence … They’re going to need something because they’re being hit pretty hard.” He also took a moment praised the US‑made interceptor as “pretty amazing.”On the prospects for a truce, the US president said the situation remained “very tough,” adding that Putin “wants to go all the way, just keep killing people — it’s no good.”Zelenskyy later wrote on Telegram, confirmed that the two leaders had agreed to boost Kyiv’s capacity to “defend the sky” amid escalating Russian attacks. He said they also discussed joint defence production along with cooperative purchases and investment.Earlier in the week, US announced the suspension of certain key weapons deliveries to Ukraine that had been promised under President Biden’s administration. The decision was taken to prioritise national interests, following a Department of Defense review of America’s military aid commitments worldwide.At the Nato summit, Trump discussed potential Patriot air defence missile system deliveries with President Zelenskyy, acknowledging their effectiveness: ""They do want to have the antimissile missiles, OK, as they call them, the Patriots,"" Trump said then. ""And we're going to see if we can make some available. We need them, too. We're supplying them to Israel, and they're very effective, 100% effective. Hard to believe how effective. They do want that more than any other thing"".Ukraine has repeatedly urged Washington to provide more Patriot systems, viewing them as critical shields for its cities against intensifying Russian air strikes.

Pakistan's development rests on backs of child labourers as 1.6 million children are exploited in Sindh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistans-development-rests-on-backs-of-child-labourers-as-1-6-million-children-are-exploited-in-sindh/articleshow/122266006.cms,".





Over 1.6 million children in Sindh, aged between five and 17 years, are trapped in child labour, according to the Sindh Child Labour Survey 2022-2024, as reported by Dawn. The survey, conducted by the provincial labour department with technical support from UNICEF and the Bureau of Statistics Sindh, paints a grim picture of child welfare in the province.According to Dawn, the survey found that 50.4 per cent of children aged 10-17 engaged in child labour were working under hazardous conditions, including long hours, exposure to extreme temperatures, and use of unsafe tools. These children face daily risks that threaten their physical and mental well-being.Labour Director General Muhammad Ali Shah, who served as the project director for the survey, told Dawn that while the overall incidence of child labour has declined by nearly 50 per cent compared to 1996, when 20.6 per cent of Sindh's child population was in labour, the sheer number of children still involved remains alarming.The survey also uncovered a stark divide in school attendance between working and non-working children. Only 40.6 per cent of children involved in labour attend school, compared to 70.5 per cent of their non-working peers. Attendance sharply declines as working children age, the report highlighted.According to Dawn, the burden is especially heavy for girls aged 14 to 17, who perform an average of 13.9 hours of household chores per week and face higher dropout rates.Child labour remains strongly correlated with poverty, with 33.7 per cent of the poorest households reporting at least one child in labour. Furthermore, 20.1 per cent of working children reported symptoms of depression, nearly double the rate of children not involved in labour, noted the survey.The highest child labour rates were recorded in Qambar Shahdadkot (30.8 per cent), Tharparkar (29 per cent), Shikarpur (20.2 per cent), and Tando Muhammad Khan (20.3 per cent), with Karachi recording the lowest at 2.38 per cent, according to Dawn.The findings underscore the urgent need for targeted policy interventions and poverty alleviation to protect vulnerable children. Without decisive action, the cycle of exploitation, poor education, and mental distress will persist for millions across Sindh.","Over 1.6 million children in Sindh, aged between five and 17 years, are trapped in child labour, according to the Sindh Child Labour Survey 2022-2024.

Rescue teams in Pakistan continued to search for survivors on Saturday after a six-storey residential building collapsed in Karachi's Lyari neighbourhood, killing 16 people and injuring 13 others, according to local officials.The building came down around 10am on Friday in the Baghdadi area of Lyari, a densely populated and impoverished part of the city. Residents said they heard cracking sounds shortly before the collapse. Rescue workers, battling high heat and humidity, have been working through the night. At least eight people are still believed to be trapped under the debris.Summiaya Syed, a police surgeon with the provincial health department, confirmed the death toll at 16 and said 13 others had been injured.Dev Raj, 54, told AFP his daughter was still under the rubble. ""She was my beloved daughter. She was so sensitive, but is under the burden of debris. She got married just six months ago,"" he said.Another resident, Jumho Maheshwari, said his entire family of six was trapped inside their first-floor apartment.

Javed Nabi Khoso, a senior district government official, said, ""We don't want to impose our orders by force. We work in phases and send them notices to leave the building. They didn't take the notices seriously.""The building had long been declared ""dangerous"" by the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA), which claimed that repeated eviction notices had been issued, according to ARY News.Locals, however, disputed the SBCA's claims, alleging that no such formal warnings were communicated.Commissioner Karachi Hassan Naqvi, who visited the site after 13 hours, laid blame on residents who continued living in unsafe structures.SBCA data reveals that Karachi currently has 578 buildings marked as unsafe, with District South holding the highest number of structurally compromised structures.Officials also confirmed that an adjacent building to the one that collapsed has suffered structural damage and is now under observation.However, Imran Khaskheli, a building owner and resident, denied receiving any notice. ""Do you think we are out of our senses to stay in an unsafe building with our families?"" he asked. He said he noticed cracks in the pillars early Friday and warned families to evacuate. ""Many did not heed my warning,"" he said, adding that about 40 families lived in the building.Shankar Kamho, 30, said his wife called him when she noticed the cracks. ""I told her to get out immediately,"" he said. His wife warned the neighbours, but one woman reportedly replied, ""This building will stand for at least 10 more years"".

Poll Do you think owning exotic pets like lions should be banned? Yes No





A runaway pet lion attacked a woman and two children on a busy street in Lahore, Pakistan, according to police statements on Friday.Police footage shared by various media outlets showed the lion leaping over a barrier from its enclosure and chasing a woman carrying shopping bags on Thursday night. Surveillance video captured the lion pouncing on her back and knocking her to the ground, while a child attempted to flee. The lion was then seen chasing other pedestrians as bystanders scrambled to escape.According to a police statement citing the children's father, quoted by AFP, the lion attacked his kids aged five and seven years, after injuring the mother, causing injuries to their arms and faces.The victims received hospital treatment, though their injuries were not life-threatening.The father's statement in the police report indicated that the lion's owners appeared entertained by the attack on pedestrians.Three individuals were arrested in connection to the case by police on Friday. ""The suspects departed with the lion but were apprehended within 12 hours of the incident,"" the Lahore Deputy Inspector General Operations office told AFP.The 11-month-old male lion was seized by authorities and transferred to a wildlife sanctuary, where the staff confirmed the animal's healthy condition.In Pakistan's most populated province of Punjab, keeping exotic animals, particularly large felines, has traditionally indicated status and influence.In December 2024, a security guard fatally shot an adult lion that had escaped its enclosure in another Lahore district, causing panic among residents.This event led the provincial administration to implement new regulations governing the trade, purchase, breeding and ownership of large cats.Current regulations require owners to obtain proper licences for these animals, which are prohibited in residential zones. Breeders must pay substantial registration fees, and farms must occupy at least 10 acres of land.","A runaway pet lion attacked a woman and two children on a busy street in Lahore, Pakistan, according to police statements.

Baloch pro-independence leader Hyrbyair Marri has sharply criticised Pakistan’s assumption of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) presidency for the month of July, calling it ""a profound affront to global human rights"" and a dangerous move that threatens global stability.In a post on X, Marri accused the UN of legitimising a state he described as built on oppression and deception. “When the accused are handed the gavel, international credibility erodes,” Marri said, warning that privilege has replaced accountability in global diplomacy.Referring to a recent statement by Pakistan’s permanent representative to the UN on promoting peace and diplomacy, Marri called it ironic. “The very country preaching peace today has exported terrorism and jihad while practising religious persecution at home,” he stated.Marri cited Pakistan’s alleged historical record of human rights abuses, including its involvement in the killing of Afghans during decades of conflict, the 1971 genocide of Bengalis, and its role in the suppression of Palestinians during General Zia-ul-Haq’s tenure. “Then-Brigadier Zia allegedly murdered thousands of Palestinians in Jordan,” Marri said.He accused Pakistan of continuing its violent campaign against the Baloch people since annexing Balochistan in 1948, in what he described as a violation of Article 2 of the UN Charter.“Pakistan has forcefully killed and disappeared hundreds of thousands of Baloch,” he said.Marri recalled key betrayals in Baloch history, including the imprisonment of Prince Abdul Kareem, the younger brother of the Khan of Kalat, who was jailed for 17 years after seeking negotiations, and the hanging of the sons of Nawab Nauroz Khan despite Pakistan's sworn assurance of safe talks. “Pakistan swore on the Quran to honour the talks, then publicly desecrated it twice,” Marri said.He further warned that Pakistan remains an artificial and militarised state, dominated by a Punjabi elite that suppresses minority national identities through enforced disappearances, torture, religious conversions, and extrajudicial killings.Marri concluded by urging the international community to reconsider its engagement with Pakistan. “Your decision lends moral sanction to a regime steeped in terror and oppression. Accountability must never yield to privilege,” he said, calling on democratic nations to revoke Pakistan’s UNSC presidency and recognise it as a rogue state.","Baloch pro-independence leader Hyrbyair Marri has sharply criticised Pakistan’s assumption of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) presidency for the month of July.

Pakistan's chief of the air staff Zaheer Ahmad Babar Sidhu is visiting the United States, days after its army chief, field marshal Asim Munir, was hosted by US President Donald Trump for lunch at the White House.In a statement, the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) said Sidhu would further enhance bilateral defence cooperation between the two countries.“This high-level visit is a strategic milestone in the Pakistan-US defence partnership. It will play a significant role in addressing key regional and global security issues as well as building institutional ties,” the statement read.This is the first United States visit in over a decade by a serving chief of Pakistan's air force, it highlighted.According to the PAF, Sidhu held important meetings with America's top military and political leadership, and reiterated his country's commitment to ""further strengthening the existing relations"" between their air forces .During the detailed discussions, they also agreed to establish high-level military relations in the future.The meetings highlighted Pakistan’s ""constructive role"" in promoting regional stability, its commitment to its ongoing counter-terrorism efforts, and perspective on the evolving geopolitical landscape of south and central Asia, the statement noted.Sidhu also went to the Capitol Hill, where he met prominent members of the US Congress, including Mike Turner, Rich McCormick, and Bill Heizenga.Last month, top general Michael ""Erik"" Kurilla had described the Asian nation as a ""phenomenal partner"" in counter-terrorism.Islamabad has also nominated Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize for brokering the India-Pakistan ceasefire - he has repeatedly taken credit fir this. India has consistently denied that Trump played any role, and that the ceasefire discussions were held only between the two neighbours.","Pakistan's chief of the air staff Zaheer Ahmad Babar Sidhu is visiting the United States.

NEW DELHI: A massive outcry has erupted in Pakistan's restive Balochistan province following the disappearance and subsequent killing of a young Baloch activist, Zeeshan Ahmed , by military personnel.Zeeshan had been campaigning for the safe return of his father, Zaheer, who was also forcibly disappeared by Pakistan's Frontier Corps in 2015. Zeeshan was 11 years old at that time, and his sister a 40-day-old newborn.Zeeshan went missing on June 29 and his body was recovered the next day.The incident is the latest in a series of ""forced disappearances"" that has long plagued Balochistan. According to a Human Rights Watch report, there are 8,463 documented cases of such disappearances between 2011 and 2024; the Pakistan Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances estimates at least 10,078 cases.Zeeshan was abducted on June 29, around 8pm, after a football match. He was walking towards home when ""two vehicles belonging to the state-backed death squad intercepted him"", the Baloch Yakjehti Committee said. ""Witnesses saw him beaten up, his hands bound and then thrown into one of the vehicles,"" the committee said.That same night, family and residents of Panjgur blocked the CPEC road and began a sit-in, demanding Zeeshan's immediate release. By morning, they were mourning as Zeeshan's ""bullet-riddled body was found dumped in Panjgur.

At least 64 people have died and 117 others have been injured across Pakistan in the past week due to flash floods and heavy rain, a government agency said on Wednesday.The worst-hit area was the northwestern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where 23 people, including 10 children, lost their lives. In Punjab province, another 21 people were killed—11 of them children—mainly due to homes collapsing in the rain, reported news agency AFP.Over the weekend, torrential rain triggered sudden floods in the Swat Valley. In one incident, 12 members of a family from Mardan were swept away while picnicking near the river. Locals said there were no immediate rescue efforts despite repeated calls for help. Videos from the scene showed people clinging to rocks and screaming as waters surged.“We kept dialling the emergency numbers, but no one came. By the time they did, it was too late,” Kabeer, a local vendor who helped retrieve bodies, told TOI earlier.Swat residents expressed frustration at repeated government failures in disaster response. “This valley has lived through terrorists, military operations, and devastating floods. Every time, we’re promised lessons will be learned, but nothing changes,” said Khan Sher from Mingora.Despite its push for climate justice globally, Pakistan's domestic preparedness remains weak. Locals in tourist towns like Bahrain and Kalam, where riverside hotels were hit hard, said the floods turned busy market areas into danger zones within minutes.“Each year we mourn our dead, patch up the roads, and brace for the next disaster,” said Liaquat Bacha, a farmer whose fields were destroyed. Rescue efforts are ongoing.","The worst-hit area was the northwestern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where 23 people, including 10 children, lost their lives.

Russia has become the first nation to officially acknowledge the Taliban's leadership in Afghanistan since their 2021 takeover, following Moscow's decision to remove the group from its banned organisations list on Thursday.The Russian foreign ministry confirmed receiving credentials from Afghanistan's new Ambassador Gul Hassan Hassan.The foreign ministry stated that recognising the Afghan government would enhance ""productive bilateral cooperation, AP reported.The Afghan foreign ministry called it a historic step, with Taliban foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi stating it sets ""a good example for other countries.""The Taliban assumed control of Afghanistan in August 2021 after US and NATO forces withdrew. They have since sought global recognition whilst implementing their strict interpretation of Islamic law.Prior to Russia's recognition, no nation had formally acknowledged the Taliban administration, though the group maintained high-level discussions and diplomatic relations with several countries, including China and the United Arab Emirates.The Taliban government has remained largely isolated internationally, primarily due to its restrictions on women.Despite initial promises of more moderate governance compared to their 1996-2001 rule, the Taliban began imposing limitations on women and girls shortly after taking power in 2021.Women face restrictions from most employment and public spaces, including parks, baths and gyms, whilst girls cannot pursue education beyond sixth grade.Russian officials have recently highlighted the importance of Taliban engagement for Afghanistan's stability, and removed their ban on the group in April.Russian ambassador to Afghanistan, Dmitry Zhirnov, announced on state Channel One television that President Vladimir Putin authorised the official recognition based on foreign minister Sergey Lavrov's recommendation.Zhirnov indicated that this decision demonstrates Russia's ""sincere striving for the development of full-fledged relations with Afghanistan.""","Russia removed the Taliban from its banned organisations list on Thursday.

Where are scam centers spreading?

Who are the victims?

Who are the people traffickers?





Human trafficking-fueled scam centers have significantly expanded their operations worldwide, according to a crime trend update released on Monday by the international police agency Interpol.Hubs where trafficking victims are forced to take part in online fraud first emerged in a few Southeast Asian nations, but investigators are now also uncovering similar fraud centers in other regions.According to the international police organization, victims now come from 66 countries across all continents, highlighting what Interpol describes as a "" global crisis "" involving hundreds of thousands of people.Scam centers are now increasingly found in other regions, including the Middle East, West Africa, fast emerging as a new regional hub, and Central America.Victims are often lured with fake job offers and then held captive in scam compounds. Many are blackmailed over alleged debts, beaten, sexually exploited, and in some cases tortured or raped.Inside these centers, they are forced to run online scams, mostly targeting people abroad to steal money.A 2024 Interpol-led operation exposed dozens of cases where victims were coerced into committing fraud, including a raid on an industrial-scale scam centre in the Philippines.That same year, police dismantled a centre in Namibia where 88 youths were forced to scam others.Emerging technologies are fuelling this trend further. The crime update notes a surge in the use of artificial intelligence, from generating fake job ads to creating deepfake profiles for ""sextortion"" and romance scams.Interpol says the pool of those preyed upon has widened significantly.While early human trafficking victims were mainly Chinese-speaking and came from China, Malaysia, Thailand or Singapore, people are now being trafficked to such hubs from South America, East Africa and Western Europe.""Tackling this rapidly globalizing threat requires a coordinated international response,"" said said Interpol's acting head of police services Cyril Gout.The report found that about 90 per cent of human trafficking facilitators came from Asia, while 11% were from South America or Africa.About 80 per cent of these facilitators were men, with 61 per cent aged between 20 and 39.Online scam centers were initially concentrated in Cambodia, with additional trafficking hubs later uncovered in Laos and Myanmar. Today, similar operations have been identified in at least four more Asian countries, and evidence shows the model is spreading to other regions such as West Africa, where cyber-enabled financial crime is already common.In its findings, Interpol warned that the spread of such criminal networks needs urgent, coordinated action to disrupt trafficking routes and support victims.Interpol said that these criminal hubs are increasingly intertwined with other major transnational crimes, demanding a globally coordinated response.Trafficking routes used for scam centers are being exploited for smuggling drugs, firearms, and endangered wildlife like tigers and pangolins, Interpol said.","Human trafficking-fueled scam centers have significantly expanded their operations worldwide.

Dhaka: The alleged rape of a 26-year-old minority Hindu woman in Bangladesh's Cumilla district by a ""supporter"" of former PM Khaleda Zia's BNP has sparked widespread outrage, with the High Court directing that the video of her assault, which went viral on social media, be removed immediately and she be given police protection.Fazar Ali has been arrested on the charge of rape while four others are accused of making and circulating the video, said authorities, who have also been directed to ensure medical support to the woman. HC asked them to file a report within 15 days on the progress of investigations into the Thursday night incident. The video surfaced online on Saturday night.Condemning the incident and demanding exemplary punishment, BNP secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir said there is a ""dangerous conspiracy afoot to damage BNP's reputation"". The party is yet to clarify whether Fazar was linked to it. Fakhrul claimed the woman was a Hindu expatriate's wife.Fazar, after the Sheikh Hasina-led Awami League govt's fall last year, started introducing himself as a BNP member and attending its programmes, according to sources in political parties. He's seen in photos of BNP's Ramchandrapur South Union office's inauguration on Dec 14 last year.University students, including in Dhaka, held marches in solidarity with the victim, calling for justice.While Naripokkho, a women's rights body, called on citizens to break silence and resist violence against women, human rights organisations such as Ain o-Salish Kendra and Manusher Jonno Foundation called for ""swift trial and exemplary punishment"".The woman filed a case on Friday. She said she had come with her children to visit her parents, and on Thursday night, Fazar came to her house and asked her to open the door. When she refused, he broke the door, entered the house and raped her, according to authorities.","Fazar Ali has been arrested on the charge of rape while four others are accused of making and circulating the video.

TOI Correspondent from London:





The solicitor general has referred the sentence handed down to a 15-year-old British boy for killing 80-year-old Indian-origin Punjab-born dog walker Bhim Kohli to the Court of Appeal for being unduly lenient.Several MPs and members of the public had requested for the sentence to be reviewed under the unduly lenient scheme.The boy and a girl (13) were convicted of manslaughter on April 8 after a trial at which they pleaded not guilty. The pair were sentenced on June 5 at Leicester Crown Court.Kohli was killed while walking his dog Rocky in a Leicestershire park on Sept 1 last year.The boy, who was 14 at the time, wearing a balaclava, racially abused Kohli before slapping him across the face with his slider shoe as Kohli was kneeling, and then kicked and punched him to the ground. He was sentenced to seven years in prison for attacking and injuring Kohli.The girl, who was 12 at the time, was sentenced to a three-year youth rehabilitation order and six-month curfew, for encouraging the boy to use violence, filming the attack and laughing.Kohli died in hospital the following day. Originally from Punjab, he had previously owned a factory that made jumpers.A spokesperson for the attorney general’s office told TOI: “The solicitor general, Lucy Rigby, was appalled by this violent, cowardly attack on an innocent man.After undertaking a detailed review of the case, the solicitor general concluded the sentence of the 15-year-old boy could be referred to the Court of Appeal. The court will determine if the sentence is increased or not.”The sentence of the 13-year-old girl will not be referred.Peter Bedford, one of the MPs who had requested the sentence get reviewed, said: “Whilst I welcome the referral of the male’s sentence as being ‘unduly lenient’, I am shocked that the female’s sentence, which is non-custodial in nature, has not been referred for reconsideration.”Outside court, following the sentencing, Kohli’s daughter, Susan, had said she felt angry and disappointed at the sentences.","Bhim Kohli, 80, was killed while walking his dog Rocky in a Leicestershire park on Sept 1 last year.

Of these, 10,865 hospital doctors and 31,992 nurses were Indian.“While the NHS has always welcomed recruits from abroad, today, the NHS disproportionately relies on international recruitment…We will need to reduce the NHS’ dependence on overseas staff from its current level — where 34% of new recruits have a non-UK nationality. It’s our ambition to reduce international recruitment to less than 10% by 2035,” the plan states.It also says UK medical graduates will be prioritised above overseas recruits for foundation training, and will be prioritised, alongside those who have worked in the NHS for a significant period, for specialty training. It said that the 2020 decision to open competition for postgraduate medical training to international trainees on equal terms with UK-trained graduates meant the competition ratios for postgraduate places had increased to a level which was “unacceptable”.Ramesh Mehta, president of BAPIO, which represents Indian-origin doctors and nurses, is opposed to the plan. He said a third of UK-trained medical graduates left the country last year and went to places like New Zealand, Canada and Australia. “The number of medical staff required will continue to grow and will be impossible to have enough local graduates to fill the roles, especially if they continue to move abroad,” he said. He said the authors of the plan are “living in dreamland” because unless things in the NHS change, local graduates will continue to emigrate.“Last year almost 10,000 Indian doctors came to the UK to take the screening exam to work in the NHS. But many have no jobs and some have gone back. There are no jobs in the NHS at a junior level. Many doctors can’t get postgraduate training in India so that’s why they want to come to the UK,” he said, explaining training posts should be given on merit to those already working in the NHS, not on nationality.","UK PM Keir Starmer has announced plans to cut the number of overseas staff recruited for the NHS from its current level of 34% to under 10% by 2035.

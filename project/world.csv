Greta Thunberg claims she has been 'kidnapped'; Israel says Gaza-bound 'selfie yacht' diverted: What we know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/greta-thunberg-claims-she-has-been-kidnapped-israel-says-gaza-bound-selfie-yacht-diverted-what-we-know/articleshow/121715626.cms,"Here's what we know so far:

'Intercepted and kidnapped,' claims Thunberg



‘Selfie yacht passengers safe'



'Ways to deliver aid that doesn't involve Instagram selfies'







Climate activist Greta Thunberg , en route to war-torn Gaza, on Monday claimed that she had been kidnapped by Israeli forces and appealed for help. In response, Israeli authorities said that the aid vessel carrying Thunberg and other activists had been ""diverted"" to Israel and all the passengers, including Greta, were safe.“If you see this video, we are being intercepted and kidnapped in international waters by the Israeli occupational forces, or forces that support Israel,"" Thunberg said in the clip.Israel foreign ministry condemned this move calling it a ""publicity"" stunt and informed that ""selfie yacht"" was being diverted to Israel. It advised the passengers to return to their home countries.The October 7 Hamas-led attack killed about 1,200 people in Israel and took 251 hostages, with 55 still held—many presumed dead. In response, Israel’s military campaign has killed over 54,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children according to Gaza’s health ministry. The war has devastated Gaza, displacing nearly 90% of its population and leaving residents heavily reliant on international aid.Thunberg, and 11 other activists were on their way to Gaza to deliver aid when the climate activist claimed that their ship had been ""intercepted and kidnapped"" by Israeli forces in the international waters.She further appealed the Swedish government to release her.“My name is Greta Thunberg, and I am from Sweden. If you see this video, we are being intercepted and kidnapped in international waters by the Israeli occupational forces, or forces that support Israel. I urge all my friends, family and comrades to put pressure on the Swedish government to release me and the others as soon as possible,” she said.The Madleen, which set sail from Sicily a week ago, was organised by the Freedom Flotilla Coalition. During its journey, the vessel stopped on Thursday to rescue four migrants who had leapt into the sea in an attempt to escape detention by the Libyan coast guard.Rima Hassan, a French member of the European Parliament of Palestinian origin, was also among the volunteers on the vessel. She has been denied entry into Israel due to her outspoken criticism of Israeli policies toward Palestinians.Taking a swipe at the activists, Israel posted a video of the ship in which the IDF was seen providing food and water to those aboard. Calling them ""selfie yacht passengers"" it said that the ""show is over"". In another post, it informed that Thunberg was on ""her way to Israel, safe and in good spirits"".""Greta Thunberg is currently on her way to Israel, safe and in good spirits,"" it said.""All the passengers of the ‘selfie yacht’ are safe and unharmed. They were provided with sandwiches and water. The show is over,"" it said.Providing the reasoning behind diverting the ship to Israel, its foreign ministry said that there were ""ways to deliver aid to the Gaza Strip — they do not involve Instagram selfies.""""The 'selfie yacht' of the 'celebrities' is safely making its way to the shores of Israel. The passengers are expected to return to their home countries,"" the Israeli foreign ministry said.""While Greta and others attempted to stage a media provocation whose sole purpose was to gain publicity — and which included less than a single truckload of aid — more than 1,200 aid trucks have entered Gaza from Israel within the past two weeks, and in addition, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation has distributed close to 11 million meals directly to civilians in Gaza,"" it added.It further informed that the ""tiny aid"" left on the vessel would be delivered to Gaza.""There are ways to deliver aid to the Gaza Strip — they do not involve Instagram selfies. The tiny amount of aid that was on the yacht and not consumed by the 'celebrities' will be transferred to Gaza through real humanitarian channels,"" it said.","Greta Thunberg, and 11 other activists were on their way to Gaza to deliver aid when the climate activist claimed that their ship had been ""intercepted and kidnapped"" by Israeli forces in the international waters.

'How dumb can she be?' Democrats' claim of 'peaceful' LA protests invites backlash; TV shows burning cars,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/how-dumb-can-she-be-democrats-claim-of-peaceful-la-protests-invites-backlash-tv-shows-burning-cars/articleshow/121715727.cms,"Nanette Barragán calls the Los Angeles riots ""Peaceful Protests"" on CNN





Democratic Representative Nanette Barragán is under fire on social media after calling the recent unrest in Los Angeles “peaceful protests” and urging for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to leave the community.Barragán represents parts of southern Los Angeles. She made the remarks during an appearance on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday, as television footage showed a car engulfed in flames amid rising tensions following immigration raids and violent clashes over the weekend.“It’s a concern,” Barragán said when asked about US President Donald Trump ’s deployment of 2,000 California National Guard troops to the city. “It’s going to escalate the situation. People are going to protest because they’re angry about the situation.”The deployment came after a weekend of chaos that saw federal agents clash with demonstrators. On Saturday night, officers fired tear gas, pepper balls and flash-bang explosives at protesters near a Home Depot in Paramount, California, after rocks and cement were thrown at law enforcement vehicles. A day earlier, demonstrators had gathered outside a federal detention facility demanding the release of more than 40 individuals held for immigration violations.Police in riot gear responded with tear gas.In a statement to HuffPost, Barragán said she had been informed by local law enforcement that the California National Guard would remain in the city for 30 days. She added that department of homeland security officials had told officers that ICE would be carrying out arrests over the same period.“Given [President Donald] Trump’s reasoning for mobilising the National Guard, we expect them to be deployed during that same time frame,” Barragán said.The White House said the deployment was meant to address “lawlessness that has been allowed to fester” in the city. National Guard troops began arriving in Los Angeles on Sunday morning.California governor Gavin Newsom criticised the move, calling it a stunt. “The federal government is taking over the California National Guard and deploying 2,000 soldiers in Los Angeles — not because there is a shortage of law enforcement, but because they want a spectacle,” he posted on X. “Don’t give them one. Never use violence. Speak out peacefully.”Barragán acknowledged that violence had occurred, but insisted the protests were rooted in legitimate frustration with the presence of federal immigration officers.“We have to remember why this is happening,” she said. “It’s happening because of everything that’s been going on the last couple of months. And this community is saying, ‘We don’t want ICE in our community. We want you out.’”The Congresswoman encouraged protesters to remain non-violent, saying, “Protesters who are violent should be arrested and prosecuted,” but she also accused federal officers of being aggressive regardless of protester behaviour.“The president is sending the National Guard because he doesn’t like the scenes, the scenes of people peacefully protesting,” Barragán said.According to the Associated Press, ICE officials have detained at least 100 people in Los Angeles over the past week on immigration charges.",Democratic Representative Nanette Barragán is under fire on social media.

Republicans will pass Trump's tax bill: Speaker Mike Johnson,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/republicans-will-pass-trumps-tax-bill-speaker-mike-johnson/articleshow/121715670.cms,"



WASHINGTON: With an uncharacteristically feistiness, speaker Mike Johnson took clear sides Sunday in President Trump's breakup with billionaire Elon Musk.The Republican House leader and staunch Trump ally said Musk's criticism of GOP's massive tax and budget policy bill will not derail the measure, and he downplayed Musk's influence over GOP-controlled Congress. ""I didn't go out to craft a piece of legislation to please the richest man in the world,"" Johnson said, ""What we're trying to do is help hardworking Americans who are trying to provide for their families and make ends meet.""Johnson said he has exchanged text messages with Musk since the former chief of department of govt efficiency (DOGE) came out against the GOP bill.Musk called it an ""abomination"" that would add to US debts and threaten economic stability. He urged voters to flood Capitol Hill with calls to vote against the measure, which is pending in the senate after clearing the House. His criticism sparked an angry social media back-and-forth with Trump.Johnson was dismissive of Musk's threats to finance opponents - even Democrats - of Republican members who back the bill. ""We've got almost no calls to the offices... And I think that indicates people are taking a wait and see attitude. Some who may be convinced by some of his arguments, but rest understand: this is a very exciting piece of legislation.""",The Republican House leader and staunch Trump ally said Musk's criticism of GOP's massive tax and budget policy bill will not derail the measure.

In a challenge to President Trump's vow to take control of Greenland, President Emmanuel Macron of France will visit the Arctic island on June 15 with the aim of ""contributing to the reinforcement of European sovereignty. ""The French presidency announced the visit on Saturday, saying Macron had accepted an invitation from Jens-Frederik Nielsen, Greenland's PM, and Mette Frederiksen, the Danish PM, with whom it said Macron would discuss ""security in the North Atlantic and the Arctic"".Greenland, a semiautonomous island that is a territory of Denmark, a Nato ally, has been thrust in recent months from a remote, uneventful existence to the centre of a geostrategic storm by Trump's repeated demands that it become part of the US, one way or another. ""I think there's a good possibility that we could do it without military force,"" Trump said in March, but added he would not ""take anything off the table.""Macron, who has seen in the provocations directed at Europe by Trump govt an opportunity for European assertion of its power, will be the first foreign head of state to go to Greenland since Trump embarked on his annexation campaign this year.

Early this year, France's foreign minister, Jean-Noel Barrot, offered to send troops to help defend the island. Denmark demurred.Macron will stop in Greenland on his way to the G-7 meeting in Canada that runs from June 15 to 17. Trump has also suggested Canada should be absorbed into the US as the 51st state, so Macron will be travelling from one of Trump's targets for territorial expansion to another.

Who was Muhammad Sinwar?







The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) and Shin Bet security agency on Sunday confirmed that the body of Hamas leader Muhammad Sinwar was found inside a tunnel located under the European Hospital in Khan Younis, in southern Gaza.""Mohammad Sinwar was responsible for the deaths of countless civilians. He was eliminated in an IDF & ISA strike on May 13,"" IDF said in a post on X.""His body was found beneath the European hospital in Khan Yunis—more proof of how Sinwar, and Hamas, hide behind their civilians and purposely embed themselves in civilian areas, such as hospitals,"" the post further said, adding, ""He died the way he lived—underground.""According to the military, the tunnel was used by Hamas as a command center, The Times of Israel reported.Israeli fighter jets bombarded the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis on May 13 to kill Muhammad Sinwar, one of Hamas' remaining top leaders in the enclaveTroops reached the hospital several days earlier, and later retrieved the body of Sinwar along with the bodies of other Hamas members, as per The Times of Israel report.The Israeli military said that Sinwar was killed in an Israeli strike on the tunnel on May 13. The same strike also killed Muhammad Shabana, the commander of Hamas’ Rafah Brigade, and Mahdi Quara, commander of the group’s South Khan Younis Battalion.The IDF added that it found several items belonging to Sinwar and Shabana inside the tunnel, including ID cards. Weapons were also recovered.The IDF said that the identification process has confirmed that one of the bodies belongs to Sinwar, while the other bodies are still being identified.Earlier in May, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing Hamas and Arab officials, that the meeting between Hamas leaders was held to talk about their position on ceasefire negotiations and a hostage deal, among other topics. After learning of the gathering, the Israeli Air Force began preparing for a strike, The Times of Israel's report said. Senior officers believed it might be canceled over concerns that hostages could be nearby, as Sinwar was known to keep them close.But once intelligence showed that no hostages were near the commanders, the Israeli air force was given approval to carry out the attack. Jets were launched, and the strike was executed.Muhammad Sinwar, a senior military figure in Hamas, was the younger brother of former Hamas leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar. He had been on Israel’s most wanted list for several months.Israeli officials said Sinwar had resisted efforts to negotiate a hostage deal and had blocked progress toward a ceasefire. After the death of Muhammad Deif, Hamas’s top military commander, in July 2024, Sinwar took over the group’s military operations.Yahya Sinwar had been made the overall Hamas leader after Israel killed Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in the same month. When Yahya Sinwar was killed in combat in October 2024, Muhammad Sinwar became the leader of Hamas in the Gaza Strip.","The body of Hamas leader Muhammad Sinwar was found inside a tunnel located under the European Hospital in Khan Younis, in southern Gaza.

The IRS Faceoff That Sparked the Breakdown



Blow by Blow



Elon Musk sported a black eye at the Oval Office press meet and blamed his son X for it.

A Partnership Implodes



Pride, Power, and the Politics of Ego



The Fallout: Contracts, NASA, and the “America Party”



Final Thought







Betteridge’s law of headlines states that any headline ending in a question mark can be answered with the word “no.” But that’s not the case here. As far as reports—and word from the horse’s mouth are concerned—it would appear that, during this Pride Month, Elon Musk , the richest man in the world, did lose at fisticuffs to Scott Bessent, an openly gay member of the Trump cabinet.And it happened in the West Wing—which is fitting, because Donald Trump is the first WWE Hall of Famer to have served as President of the United States.Musk, once Trump’s most powerful private-sector ally, had entered the Oval Office to lobby for his pick to head the IRS. Bessent, a Yale-educated hedge fund veteran and one of the highest-ranking openly gay officials in the Republican Party, had other plans. What began as a policy disagreement spilled into the hallway. By the end of it, Musk had to be escorted out of the White House—visibly injured and politically diminished.The tension had been building for months. In mid-April, Musk and Bessent met with President Trump to argue over who should become acting IRS Commissioner. Musk supported Gary Shapley, a former IRS investigator known for his role in the Hunter Biden whistleblower case. Bessent pushed for Michael Faulkender, a MAGA-aligned economist with prior experience at the Treasury.Trump ultimately sided with Bessent.That single decision triggered a rapid unravelling. For Musk—who had spent months trying to position himself as the federal government’s chief efficiency czar—being overruled on IRS leadership was a stinging blow. But the real damage came after the meeting.After leaving the Oval Office, Musk and Bessent exchanged words in the hallway. According to multiple accounts relayed by Stephen K. Bannon, the former Trump adviser, Bessent accused Musk of failing to deliver on his promise to uncover “more than $1 trillion” in government waste. “You’re a fraud. You’re a total fraud,” Bessent reportedly said.Musk, furious, slammed his shoulder into Bessent’s rib cage “like a rugby player.” Bessent hit back. The clash escalated until aides rushed in to separate the two, just outside the national security adviser’s office. Musk was then escorted out of the building. Trump, informed moments later, was overheard muttering, “This is too much.”Days later, Musk appeared at a press event with a black eye, which he claimed came from “play-fighting with his son.” White House officials, however, made no effort to deny the hallway brawl.The fight marked the symbolic collapse of one of the most unconventional political alliances in modern American history. Musk, who had moved into the Lincoln Bedroom and assumed a major role in shaping Trump’s government reform agenda, quickly fell from grace.His early moves—including a mass email demanding that all federal employees submit weekly “five accomplishments” reports—alienated agencies and judges alike. His DOGE initiative (Department of Government Efficiency), which aimed to cut federal bureaucracy with AI audits and massive layoffs, drew resistance from seasoned staffers and even MAGA loyalists.By April, Musk had become a lightning rod. Protesters outside federal buildings held signs reading, “No One Voted for Elon Musk.” Inside the White House, his influence waned. Bessent’s quiet but effective resistance, grounded in budget discipline and political capital, began to prevail.That all this happened just weeks before Pride Month lent the episode a layer of cultural symbolism.Bessent, long respected for his economic acumen, had already broken barriers as an openly gay Republican in the highest echelons of financial policymaking. But the confrontation with Musk—and the fact that he walked away with Trump’s confidence and no public reprimand—cemented his role as a formidable power player in the second Trump administration.While Musk’s methods relied on spectacle, Bessent operated through strategy—and, in this case, personal resolve.The West Wing brawl was just one rupture in a broader collapse. By May, Trump began actively distancing himself from Musk—questioning his drug use, threatening to review federal contracts with Tesla and SpaceX, and yanking Jared Isaacman’s NASA nomination, which Musk had championed.Musk, meanwhile, lashed out online. He attacked Trump’s landmark tax and spending bill and teased the launch of a third party, calling it The America Party. He also doubled down on claims that Trump had ties to Jeffrey Epstein—a charge he has not substantiated.Trump responded with silence at first, then blunt disappointment. “I’m very disappointed in Elon,” he told reporters. He reportedly told aides he was considering selling his Tesla Model S, which had been parked outside the White House since March.What started as a collaboration between two disruptors—one from politics, the other from tech—ended in recriminations, hallway brawls, and the exposure of vastly different worldviews. Musk came to Washington to dismantle the system. He left having been outmanoeuvred, outpunched, and—quite literally—shown the door.Scott Bessent didn’t tweet. He didn’t gloat. He just walked away, still Treasury Secretary, with his pick running the IRS and his credibility enhanced.In Washington, strength isn’t measured in followers or stock price. It’s measured in who the President trusts when things get messy. And during Pride Month 2025, amid a mess of egos, algorithms, and ambition, it was the gay banker who kept his footing—while Elon Musk lost his.","Elon Musk and Scott Bessent, an openly gay member of the Trump cabinet, clashed in the West Wing.

Musk-Trump breakup over? Elon posts US President's post slamming Gavin Newsom over LA riots; National Guard deployed amid rising unrest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/musk-trump-breakup-over-elon-posts-us-presidents-post-slamming-gavin-newsom-over-la-riots-national-guard-deployed-amid-rising-unrest/articleshow/121717602.cms,"Signs show Trump-Musk rift appears to be ending





In what appears to be a brief thaw in the heated feud between Elon Musk and US President Donald Trump , the tech billionaire reshared a Truth Social post by the MAGA supremo targeting California governor Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass.This moment of alignment comes after a week of bitter exchanges between the two, which included Musk’s explosive claim that Trump appeared in Jeffrey Epstein ’s files and Trump branding Musk as “Crazy.”The Truth Social post addressed the ongoing riots in Los Angeles, where thousands have protested against the Trump administration’s immigration policies, including recent ICE detentions. The unrest escalated to the point where the National Guard was deployed to control the large-scale demonstrations.Trump wrote: ""Governor Gavin Newscum and “Mayor” Bass should apologize to the people of Los Angeles for the absolutely horrible job that they have done, and this now includes the ongoing L.A. riots. These are not protesters, they are troublemakers and insurrectionists. Remember, NO MASKS!""Protesters set fire to vehicles, threw objects, and chanted slogans against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations, which resulted in the arrest of several people alleged to be undocumented immigrants and gang members.These raids sparked outrage within Los Angeles’s large Latino community.Despite this apparent moment of unity, Musk and Trump have grown distant since Musk’s controversial claims regarding the Epstein files, which he later retracted. Tensions have also risen since March, when Trump curtailed the powers of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a unit Musk had headed.Musk formally stepped down from his role at DOGE on May 1 during a low-key White House ceremony, where Trump thanked him for his service and presented him with a ceremonial “golden key” to the White House.The tech entrepreneur has also criticised Trump’s “one big beautiful bill,” expressing concerns that the Office of Budget and Budgetary Bureau (OBBB) would significantly increase the US public debt.Unable to sway Trump or Republican lawmakers, Musk launched a “Kill the Bill” campaign on X, leading to a public and heated showdown with the president.In a recent interview aboard Air Force One, when asked about Elon Musk and Tesla’s future, Trump reassured, “He’ll be ok.”Musk was the main right-hand for Trump’s Oval Office bid in the 2024 presidential campaign and went toe to toe with Trump on governmental policies while also downplaying Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris.","Musk reshared a Truth Social post by the MAGA supremo targeting California governor Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass.

Here are the top 10 things to know about the LA protest:

Protesters torched vehicles and disrupted traffic, while law enforcement responded with flash-bangs and smoke grenades to disperse crowds from key areas.

At least three self-driving Waymo vehicles were set on fire, with two others vandalised, highlighting anger at both immigration policy and Silicon Valley’s presence.

A major freeway was blocked for over an hour as protesters took to the roads before being pushed back by the California Highway Patrol .

. Soldiers from California's 79th Infantry Brigade were stationed across the city, wearing full camouflage and armed with live rounds, prompting criticism that their presence was more about intimidation than order.

Trump defended his decision, suggesting a broader deployment of troops may follow. He also hinted at invoking the Insurrection Act, which permits military use in domestic unrest.

US Northern Command confirmed that around 500 Marines were in a ""prepared to deploy"" state to support federal operations if needed.

Leading Democrats, including former Vice President Kamala Harris, slammed the deployment as a ""dangerous escalation meant to provoke chaos"".

House Speaker Mike Johnson defended Trump’s action, accusing governor Newsom of failing to maintain law and order in the state.

Many demonstrators said the Guard’s presence was a scare tactic. “These protests have been peaceful,” protester Thomas Henning told news agency AFP. “It’s intimidation, plain and simple,"" he added.

Despite the unrest, a CBS News poll taken before the protests showed that a slight majority of Americans supported the ongoing immigration crackdown.





Tensions flared in Los Angeles on Sunday as demonstrators clashed with police and set cars ablaze, protesting a series of immigration raids and the controversial deployment of National Guard troops by United States President Donald Trump. The unrest marked the third consecutive day of protests in California’s most populous city.Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations, which resulted in the arrests of several individuals alleged to be undocumented immigrants and gang members, have sparked outrage in the city’s large Latino community. The daylight raids and the federal response have only added fuel to the fire.The tension escalated after a large crowd gathered near the Los Angeles Federal Building at 4 pm to protest against the enforcement action, condemning the crackdown. The demonstrators called for the freedom of Service Employees International Union California President David Huerta.According to the labour union's statement, Huerta sustained injuries and was taken into custody while recording documentation of the raid.Protesters assembled outside Ambiance Apparel's warehouse, offering legal guidance to those detained within. They positioned themselves atop a long bed truck in the street, causing traffic disruptions on the busy thoroughfare.California Governor Gavin Newsom condemned Trump’s move to bypass state authority and activate National Guard units without his consent.“We didn’t have a problem until Trump got involved,” Newsom wrote on X (formerly Twitter). “This is a serious breach of state sovereignty — inflaming tensions while pulling resources from where they’re actually needed. Rescind the order. Return control to California.”","Tensions flared in Los Angeles on Sunday as demonstrators clashed with police and set cars ablaze, protesting a series of immigration raids.

ABC News suspended senior national correspondent Terry Moran on Sunday after he posted a harsh social media rant targeting Stephen Miller, senior White House adviser, and US President Donald Trump Moran’s comments drew sharp criticism from the Trump administration and US vice president JD Vance.On early Sunday, Moran took to X to describe Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff for policy, as a man “richly endowed with the capacity for hatred.”He wrote, “The thing about Stephen Miller is not that he is the brains behind Trumpism. Yes, he is one of the people who conceptualizes the impulses of the Trumpist movement and translates them into policy. But that’s not what’s interesting about Miller. It’s not brains. It’s bile. Miller is a man who is richly endowed with the capacity for hatred. He’s a world-class hater. You can see this just by looking at him because you can see that his hatreds are his spiritual nourishment. He eats his hate.”Moran also criticised Trump, saying, “Trump is a world-class hater. But his hatred only a means to an end, and that end his own glorification.That’s his spiritual nourishment.”ABC News responded swiftly, saying, “ABC News stands for objectivity and impartiality in its news coverage and does not condone subjective personal attacks on others.

Last November, he predicted Trump would win both the 2016 and 2024 elections, describing him as a nationalist with “an authoritarian cast of mind.” Moran said, “The way to understand Trump (as I said on ABC Election Night 2016) is to see him not as a Republican or Democrat, not as a conservative or liberal, but as a Nationalist.”Earlier this year, Moran secured a high-profile interview with Trump marking the president’s 100 days back in office. The interview included heated exchanges about deportations and Trump’s ties to the gang MS-13.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt also condemned Moran’s posts as “unhinged and unacceptable” and said the administration had reached out to ABC about holding him accountable.","ABC News suspended senior national correspondent Terry Moran on Sunday after he posted a harsh social media rant targeting Stephen Miller.

In light of recent arrests of two alleged ""bioterrorists"" in Michigan, an expert has advocated for complete disengagement from diplomatic relations with China, warning that they might be hit with 'something worse than Covid'.""The only way to stop this is to sever relations with China,"" attorney and Chinese Communist Party expert Gordon Chang told Fox News Digital. ""And I know people think that's drastic, but we are being overwhelmed, and we are going to get hit. And we are going to get hit really hard. Not just with Covid, not just with fentanyl, but perhaps with something worse.""Chang addressed the recent case involving Chinese nationals Yunqing Jian, 33, and her partner Zunyong Liu, 34. The pair allegedly conducted unauthorised research on Fusarium graminearum in American laboratories whilst smuggling it into the country over two years. Jian held a post-doctoral research position at the University of Michigan, with her studies partially supported by funding from the People's Republic of China.The Department of Justice describes Fusarium graminearum as a harmful fungus causing ""head blight"" in wheat, barley, maize and rice crops, resulting in annual global economic losses worth billions.The substance poses risks to human health, potentially causing vomiting, liver damage and reproductive complications in humans and animals.""This couple should be sent to Guantánamo,"" Chang said.

""But for a communist party, [a People's War] has great resonance, and what they're doing with their strident anti-Americanism is creating a justification to strike our country,"" he added.""This means, for example, that this couple should be sent to Guantánamo,"" he added. ""This was an attack on the United States at a time when China thought it was at war with us,"" he further said.In recent years, several incidents have raised concerns about Chinese espionage in the US. Chinese nationals and students have been caught illegally entering military bases, photographing sensitive sites, and attempting to steal trade secrets. Cases include breaches at a Key West naval station (2020), spying at Camp Grayling (2024), and drone surveillance of naval bases by a University of Minnesota student (2025).

The fragile peace, following the social media conflict between US President Donald Trump and billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk held steady, as their aides engaged in talks on Friday, according to two White House officials cited by Politico.However, one of the officials addressed Trump's Truth Social hiatus with Musk saying, ""He's stopped posting, but that doesn't mean he's happy,""""The future of their relationship is totally uncertain,"" added the official, speaking under anonymity. Both individuals have temporarily ceased their public disagreements, which included Musk's impeachment suggestions and Trump's threats regarding federal contracts for Musk's enterprises. Neither party was keen on this cessation, according to the officials familiar with both men's sentiments.Trump was particularly irritated by Musk's suggestion of presidential connections to Jeffrey Epstein , stating Trump was ""in the Epstein files."" While Trump's name appears in publicly available Epstein-related court documents alongside other prominent figures, no wrongdoing has been linked to Trump. However, Musk's claim about Trump's electoral victory depending on his support, including substantial political contributions, particularly angered the president, the officials claimed.This dispute between the two emerged as the president and Republican leadership attempted to advance significant domestic policy legislation, potentially Trump's most substantial second-term achievement.

""If America can help sustain this ceasefire, its role in arranging a comprehensive dialogue would benefit both nations,"" he said.

More than 200,000 Afghans have left Pakistan since April as Islamabad ramped up its deportation campaign targeting undocumented migrants, with Iran also increasing expulsions, raising concerns over Afghanistan’s capacity to manage the influx.According to Pakistan’s ministry of interior, over 135,000 Afghans left the country in April, followed by 67,000 in May, and more than 3,000 in just the first two days of June. The repatriation drive, which began in November 2023, has now seen over one million Afghans return from Pakistan, reported news agency ANI, citing ARY News.The deportation campaign is aimed at more than 800,000 Afghans whose residency documents have been revoked. Among them are individuals born or raised in Pakistan. Islamabad has accused Afghan nationals of links to terrorism and blamed Kabul for harbouring militants, a charge the Taliban authorities have repeatedly denied.Farmer Mohammad Wali, who crossed into Afghanistan via the southern Spin Boldak border, was quoted by AFP as saying, “We left behind our orchards... but we said to ourselves, ‘If we stay, maybe one day we’ll lose our dignity.’”With Eid al-Adha approaching, the pace of returns has slightly slowed, though crossings continue daily.Iran, meanwhile, is pushing ahead with similar measures. The UN's International Organisation for Migration (IOM) recorded 15,675 Afghan deportations from Iran in May, more than double the figure in April.The IOM expressed alarm at the increasing number of families, rather than single men, being sent back, calling this “a new and concerning trend.”In late May, Iranian authorities ordered undocumented Afghans to leave by July 6—a move that could impact as many as four million people, according to AFP. Already, more than 450,000 Afghans have returned from Iran since January.Both nations host millions of Afghan refugees who fled decades of conflict.But as economic conditions worsen and political tensions rise, public support for Afghan migrants has diminished. Pakistan, which still hosts around three million Afghans, has also warned it may revoke the UNHCR-issued refugee cards of 1.3 million cardholders by the end of June.The IOM has repeatedly urged countries to “immediately suspend the forced return of Afghans... until safe, voluntary, and dignified return conditions are in place.”The Taliban authorities, who remain internationally unrecognised, have echoed the call, asking for returns to occur in a “dignified” manner.Analysts view the deportation moves, particularly by Pakistan, as politically driven. Islamabad is under pressure to address domestic security threats, especially in border regions plagued by insurgencies.However, rights groups and humanitarian agencies warn that Afghanistan’s already fragile infrastructure is ill-equipped to absorb such a massive and sudden return of people.","More than 200,000 Afghans have left Pakistan since April as Islamabad ramped up its deportation campaign targeting undocumented migrants.

Baloch human rights group Paank strongly condemned the killing of two Baloch men whose bodies were found in Kalat, calling it another disturbing sign of growing violence and repression in the region.Samiullah, son of Muhammad Hanif, and Bismillah, son of Ghulam Sarwar, both residents of Padang Abad in Mastung district, were found dead on 3 June in the Ganda Gain neighbourhood of Sheikhri, Kalat. According to Levies officials, both men had been brutally shot, their bodies discarded and later transported to RHC Mangochar for formalities.Paank, in a post on X said, “Forcibly disappeared by Pakistani security forces on May 29, 2025, their executions are a glaring testament to the ongoing horrors of enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings in Balochistan, a despicable violation of humanity that must be stopped.”The rights organisation said 2025 has already seen a surge in such cases. In February alone, Paank documented five extrajudicial executions and 33 enforced disappearances. Among the victims were Bashir Ahmad Marri and Arman Marri, who were reportedly executed in a staged encounter after being abducted in 2023.The group also referred to the tragic case of Rehana, who was shot dead in Awaran while trying to prevent her husband’s kidnapping.In April, Mehrab and Khan Mohammad were tortured to death in Kech after disappearing earlier in the month, while the tortured body of Sher Khan Nazar was discovered in Turbat two days after he went missing.Most recently, Zabid Ali, a resident of Chaghi, was abducted from his home on 11 May.In a separate post on X, Paank demanded the safety and recovery of three members of the family who “were forcibly disappeared in Pidarak area in Kech district.”On June 3, 2025, Pakistani security forces allegedly carried out a series of enforced disappearances in the Pidarak area of Kech district, Balochistan. Among those abducted from their homes were Sinkandar Baloch, son of Muhammad Anwar; Siddique Sabzal, son of Sabzal Baloch; and Ibrahim Yaqoob, son of Yaqoob Baloch. All three men were reportedly detained without any legal process, and their whereabouts remain unknown.Enforced disappearances remain one of Balochistan’s most alarming human rights crises.

'Vindictive nature': Imran Khan levels fiery charge at Asim Munir; alleges army chief targeted his wife,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/vindictive-nature-imran-khan-levels-fiery-charge-at-asim-munir-alleges-army-chief-targeted-his-wife/articleshow/121616395.cms,"Pakistan On Knees, Pleads India To Withdraw This Decision; ‘Reconsider Blocking…’ | Watch





NEW DELHI: Former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan has accused army chief general Asim Munir of waging a personal vendetta against his wife, Bushra Bibi.In a social media post on Monday, Khan claimed the alleged animosity dates back to his decision to remove Munir from his position as Director General of Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) during Khan's tenure.In a social media post on Monday, Khan claimed that following Munir's dismissal, the general attempted to contact Bushra Bibi through intermediaries, but she refused, stating she ""had no involvement with such affairs."" Khan attributed his wife's 14-month imprisonment and alleged mistreatment to ""General Asim Munir's vindictive nature.""Khan further asserted that Bushra Bibi, a private citizen with no political role, has been falsely accused and arrested repeatedly without evidence. “The way my wife has been targeted for personal vengeance is unprecedented. Even during Pakistan’s darkest periods of dictatorship, such a thing never happened,” he said, noting he had not been allowed to meet her in four weeks, despite a scheduled June 1 meeting.Turning his criticism toward the military-backed government and judiciary, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chief accused authorities of suppressing democratic dissent and rigging the political system.He blamed the events of May 9, 2023—when military installations were attacked—on a so-called “London Plan” aimed at dismantling PTI. “Our democratic mandate was brazenly stolen, and corrupt individuals — Sharifs and Zardaris — were imposed upon the nation,” he said.Khan alleged that anti-terrorism courts and judges are complicit in the crackdown on his party and deliberately ignoring key evidence. “Despite repeated demands, they refuse to summon or examine the stolen CCTV footage from May 9, 2023… We are innocent. Our people are being sentenced without evidence and without the right to a fair trial.”Calling for a judicial commission, Khan demanded investigations into the deaths of unarmed pro-democracy protesters on May 9 and November 26, 2024. He also lashed out at the judiciary, comparing current Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa to the widely criticised Justice Munir, saying the institution is “driven not by justice but by a desire to protect their own jobs and privileges.”Khan’s remarks come days after a court sentenced 11 PTI supporters, including a lawmaker, for violence and vandalism on May 9 last year—an incident triggered by his arrest.The 72-year-old PTI founder has been in Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi since mid-2023, facing multiple legal cases.","Imran Khan has accused army chief general Asim Munir of waging a personal vendetta against his wife, Bushra Bibi.

'Kabul’s Water Crisis: An Inflection Point for Action',

Pakistan On Knees, Pleads India To Withdraw This Decision; ‘Reconsider Blocking…’ | Watch





Kabul, Afghanistan’s capital, could become the first modern city to completely run out of water, warns a recent report. The report titledreleased recently by the NGO Mercy Corps, outlines in detail the city’s worsening water emergency and urges immediate international and domestic attention.The report says that Kabul’s groundwater extraction exceeds natural recharge by 44 million cubic meters each year, with the water table having dropped between 25 to 30 meters over the past decade. According to projections by Unicef, cited in the report, the city’s aquifers could run dry by 2030, potentially displacing up to 3 million people. The situation is already critical—nearly half of the boreholes, Kabul residents’ primary source of drinking water, are dry.An aquifer is an underground layer of rock, sand, or soil that holds water. It acts like a natural water tank. People access this water through wells, but if too much is taken out and not enough refills it (like from rain or snow), the aquifer can run dry.The report says, ""Kabul’s water crisis represents a failure of governance, humanitarian coordination, water regulation, and infrastructure planning... Without immediate intervention, the city risks becoming the first modern capital in the world to fully deplete its water reserves.""Kabul’s water largely comes from three main aquifers, recharged by snowmelt from the Hindu Kush mountains. However, due to climate change and recurring droughts, snow and rain have significantly declined. From October 2023 to January 2024, Afghanistan received only 45–60% of its normal winter precipitation. According to the report, ""Afghanistan is the sixth most vulnerable country in the world to impacts of climate change,"" and Kabul is already seeing the effects, with reduced snowfall and shorter winters reducing the volume of meltwater.""Shorter winters also mean less time for snow to accumulate on the Hindu Kush, and thus less meltwater runoff in the spring, even as the city’s demand for water rapidly increases,"" the report says.On the infrastructure side, only 20% of households in Kabul are connected to centralised piped water systems. Most residents rely on water pumped from borewells, many of which are unregulated or drying up. ""90% of Kabul’s residents rely on water pumped from borewells to supply their daily needs,"" the report says.The report also highlights water quality issues. ""As much as 80% of Kabul’s groundwater is contaminated with sewage, toxins, and dangerously high levels of chemicals such as arsenic and nitrates,"" posing major health risks. In interviews conducted for the report, 70% of residents said their well water had issues such as bad taste, odor, or discoloration.Economically, the crisis has forced families to spend 15–30% of their monthly income on water. In some cases, private water companies extract water and sell it back to residents at high prices. ""Weekly water costs for a single household reach 400–500 Afghanis ($6–7), exceeding food expenses for more than half of households,"" the report notes. ""To meet this financial burden, families are forced to borrow more, placing them deeper into debt. 68% of households incur water-related debt, with informal lenders charging 15–20% monthly interest.""The city’s main water sources like the Qargha Reservoir and Shah-wa-Arous Dam are either underperforming or newly operational. Long-planned projects such as the Panjshir River Pipeline and Shah Toot Dam remain delayed due to funding and political issues.Governance challenges are also severe. The National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA), responsible for water quality monitoring, has lost about 40% of its technical staff, ""largely due to technical staff fleeing the country."" Due to a lack of international recognition and funding cuts, like from USAID, the agency cannot conduct full water testing and lacks access to basic equipment.The report warns that unless urgent changes are made—including better governance, water infrastructure investment, and international cooperation—Kabul could face a humanitarian crisis. ""Without large-scale changes to Kabul’s water management dynamics, the city faces an unprecedented humanitarian disaster within the coming decade, and likely much sooner,"" it concludes.","Kabul's groundwater extraction exceeds natural recharge by 44 million cubic meters each year. The water table has dropped between 25 to 30 meters over the past decade.

Here's how the escape took place:





In a meticulously orchestrated operation, former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina departed Dhaka on August 5, 2024, under a veil of secrecy, amid escalating political unrest. She landed at Hindon Airport in India.Hasina's aircraft remained the most tracked plane that day. As per real-time data from the flightradar24 website, Bangladesh Air Force aircraft AJAX1431 become the most tracked plane globally, with over 29,000 people following its route at one point of time.The Bangladesh Air Force's Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft, designated AJAX1431, took off from Bangabandhu Airbase at 3.09pm, officially listed as a training flight. To obscure its trajectory, the aircraft's transponders and automatic geolocator systems were deactivated until it neared Indian airspace over West Bengal, The Daily Star reported citing sources.Upon approaching Indian airspace, AJAX1431 reactivated its transponders at waypoint ""BEMAK"" and altered its course from Kolkata to Hindon Air Force Base in Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh.This clandestine departure occurred just 30 minutes before protesters seized the Gono Bhaban, Hasina's official residence.Army Chief General Waker-uz-Zaman, unaware of Hasina's departure, was preparing to announce her resignation. In a later interview, he acknowledged the volatile situation and the potential risks to Hasina's life had she remained in the country.""When I was holding discussions with the political parties, somebody informed me that she is going to exit the country, she is on the run. I did not know that she was leaving the country. I think that if she had stayed, it could have been a risk to her life. Definitely, nobody would have wanted an extra-judicial killing to have happened. The situation was extremely volatile,"" he said.","Sheikh Hasina left Dhaka on August 5, 2024, amid escalating political unrest. She landed at Hindon Airport in India.

King Charles’ Cancer CONFIRMED As ‘Incurable’? Royal Health Secret Finally Revealed | Shocking Update





King Charles is reportedly ""livid"" about potentially missing a cherished Christmas tradition this year.Recent reports from The Sun indicate a shortage of pheasants at Sandringham Estate, potentially affecting the winter shooting schedule. This activity is traditionally one of the monarch's preferred holiday pursuits.""King Charles III is livid, frustrated and disappointed, reflecting both his deep personal attachment to the cherished family tradition and his broader commitment to his royal heritage,"" British royal expert Hilary Fordwich told Fox News Digital.""He's also annoyed that the mishap reflects rather poorly on the management of Sandringham, which he inherited from his mother, Queen Elizabeth II,"" she further said.""The shoot gathers his extended royal family and guests, reinforcing bonds while upholding a long-standing aristocratic tradition. The root of the problem is that Charles has always opposed importing birds from elsewhere, preferring to maintain the estate's game population. The eco-friendly approach has failed<"" she added.The reduced bird population might force the 76-year-old monarch, currently receiving cancer treatment, to cancel the traditional Boxing Day shoot, a significant component of royal holiday celebrations.British photographer Helena Chard told Fox News Digital, ""Allegedly, King Charles is disappointed that one of his favorite Christmas family traditions may not take place this year. The Sandringham shoot is questionable due to a lack of Sandringham pheasants on the estate. It seems the family will have to bond, enjoy and celebrate over another hobby, or possibly clay pigeon shoots are the way forward.""""King Charles may have felt a fleeting healthy upset, but in light of recent times, with the slimmed-down monarchy, cancer battles and more... the monarchy has found their typical ways changing as they are forced to be flexible,"" she added.A veteran gamekeeper, tasked with overseeing the bird population at the estate, was reportedly dismissed during recent personnel changes, leading to a deficit, as indicated by The Sun. A source informed the publication, ""It was a total cock-up. No birds, no bang, just red faces. The king wasn't having it.""Per Chard's account, despite the king's disappointment, he remains open to adjustments. The sovereign is currently adapting to a new schedule whilst undergoing weekly cancer treatments, all whilst maintaining his commitment to full-time royal responsibilities.The expert highlighted that the scarcity could lead the king to reassess the hunting custom, which has received criticism from organisations advocating for animal welfare.Meanwhile, royal commentator Ian Pelham Turner believes the altered arrangements might enable the king to focus on reconciliation with his younger son, Prince Harry . The Duke of Sussex and his wife Meghan Markle withdrew from their senior royal duties in 2020, stating they faced intolerable media scrutiny from British newspapers and insufficient backing from the palace. They now live in California.Following their departure from royal duties, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have voiced their concerns through various media appearances and Harry's revealing 2023 book, ""Spare."" Insiders familiar with the prince, 40, have informed People magazine about the king's apparent reluctance to engage in communication via telephone or written correspondence.""Perhaps he could bring the royal clan together, lock the door, knock all their heads together and unite the entire family, including Harry and Meghan,"" Turner told Fox News Digital. ""This may be feathers flying in a different way than a grouse shoot, but if they really believe in the Christian principles, they would try, in my view.

Former UK minister Tulip Siddiq has sought a meeting with Bangladesh's Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunus in London to clear up a ""misunderstanding"" over corruption allegations against her.In a June 4 letter to Yunus, Siddiq has asked for an opportunity to discuss the ongoing controversy during the chief adviser's visit to London next week.Yunus will meet King Charles and see UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer in Downing Street during his four-day visit from June 10-13.Siddiq said she hopes a meeting might “help clear up the misunderstanding perpetuated by the anti-corruption committee in Dhaka that I have questions to answer about my mother’s sister, the former prime minister of Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina”.“I am a UK citizen, born in London and representing the people of Hampstead and Highgate in parliament for the last decade.

A Congress MP saw us and then said to the media ‘No, I saw them together’. Mr Jaitley had to retract his statement and say ‘Yes, yes I met him but only while walking — it was a fleeting meeting’.”“I never said I went to Mr Jaitley’s office, sat in front of him, had tea with him. All I said is I told the finance minister while leaving, I’m going to London and going to Geneva for a meeting, please tell the banks to sit across the table and settle with me. How long does this once sentencetake? You see the way he denied it, and then when a Congress MP pointed out his mistake that he saw us, he quickly changed.”He also said he had always planned to go back to India but his Indian passport was revoked.In the four-hour podcast Mallya also said he would be prepared to return to India. “If I have the assurance of a fair trial and assurance of dignified existence in India, I will think about returning to India seriously. “ He then reminded Shamani of the judgment in the Sanjay Bhandari case which found “Indian detention conditions a violation of Article 3 of the ECHR (European Convention on Human Rights)”, which may mean he could not be extradited now.When asked why he had not gone already as he had lost his extradition battle in the courts, the 69-year-old said: “My stay in England is fully legitimate. There is more than the particular case you are referring to. There are ongoing proceedings in this country. It’s one of the legal battles I am fighting,” he said. This suggests he may have applied for asylum.","Vijay Mallya says he told the late former finance minister Arun Jaitley that he was about to fly out of India to London before he left for the airport in March 2016. He told “Figuring Out with Raj Shamani” he was not aware of any LOC against him, nor that it had been downgraded by the CBI to informing immigration of his travel plans.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121683967,imgsize-26222,width-400,resizemode-4/121683967.jpg"

Prince Harry's HRH Title Plan For Children Laid Bare





The relationship between King Charles and Prince Harry has reportedly deteriorated beyond repair, leaving little hope for a royal reconciliation.The 76-year-old monarch has maintained a reserved stance whilst being physically separated by 5,459 miles from his younger son, following Harry and Meghan Markle 's withdrawal from royal duties in 2020.The father-son relationship has deteriorated to such an extent that palace sources believe reconciliation is now improbable between the royal family members, according to the New York Post.""There is no turning back,"" royal expert Hilary Fordwich told Fox News. ""King Charles remains tender towards his son but can't risk communication. Prince William now has absolutely no interest in mending fences.""According to Fordwich, the king's confidants advise against reconciliation with his son as it could potentially impact Prince William's future sovereignty. ""The animosity is so deep that William has shut the door on Harry. Charles is not willing to go against his heir's wishes,"" she added.The fundamental issue remains one of trust between the parties. A palace source informed The NY Post about the king's distrust of Harry, specifically referencing the Duke of Sussex's revealing BBC interview, which reportedly destroyed their remaining trust.Recent reports suggest the king, who is battling cancer, remains reluctant to repair relations with the 40-year-old son.""The king and William don't trust Harry and Meghan with any kind of confidential conversation,"" royal biographer Sally Bedell Smith told People, adding that ""the underlying issue is trust.""NY Post sources also indicate Prince William, Harry's estranged brother and heir to the throne, shows no inclination towards reconciliation. Meanwhile, the palace sources further claim that Camilla is attempting to remain uninvolved in the situation.A royal commentator recently suggested that the duke's only chance at family reconciliation would require maintaining a ""dignified silence"".This report comes just days after revelations that during delays in obtaining UK passports for their children Archie and Lilibet, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle considered adopting the Spencer surname, being Harry's mother's Diana's maiden name.The Duke of Sussex initiated discussions with his uncle Earl Spencer regarding a potential family surname modification, an action that potentially strained relations further with the royal establishment.The family currently utilises Sussex as their surname, and reports indicate they submitted UK passport applications for Archie and Lilibet, aged six and four respectively, using Sussex alongside HRH (His/Her Royal Highness) titles.According to sources speaking to The Guardian, prolonged delays in passport approval led Harry and Meghan to suspect resistance towards their children's HRH titles, prompting the duke to seek counsel from his uncle.Contrasting accounts have emerged regarding Earl Spencer's stance. Whilst the Mail on Sunday suggested Princess Diana's brother cautioned against the change, citing significant legal obstacles, sources close to Harry and Meghan refute this.

: An oil portrait believed to be the only painting Mahatma Gandhi ever sat for is going under the hammer at Bonhams in July with an estimate of £50,000-£70,000 (Rs 58 lakh to Rs 81 lakh. )It is the first time this portrait has ever been sold at auction as it remained in British artist Clare Leighton’s collection until her death in 1989, after which it was passed down through her family.Leighton, reputed for her wooden engravings, was introduced to Gandhi when he visited London in 1931 to attend the Second Round Table Conference.At the time, she was in a relationship with political journalist Henry Noel Brailsford, who was a passionate supporter of Indian Independence. He had travelled to India in 1930 where he met key Independence figures. Afterwards he published the book “Rebel India”, met Gandhi in London in 1931 and introduced Leighton to him. She became one of very few artists admitted to his office and was given the opportunity to sit with him to sketch and paint him in 1931.In Nov 1931 Leighton showcased her portraits at the Albany Galleries in London.The following month, Gandhi's personal secretary, Mahadev Desai, wrote a letter to Leighton, a copy of which is attached to the backing board, which reads: “It was such a pleasure to have had you here for many mornings doing Mr Gandhi’s portrait.”According to the artist’s family, the portrait was on public display in 1974 when it was allegedly attacked with a knife by a Hindu right-wing activist. The catalogue entry states: “We have found no documentation to corroborate this, but the painting shows signs of restoration to what appears to be repaired tears in several places. A label attached to the backing board confirms the painting was restored in 1974 by the Lyman Allyn Museum Conservation Laboratory. ”“There is nothing comparable to this painting in existence as it was painted in his lifetime and was a painting that he sat for on multiple occasions,” Rhyanon Demery, head of sale, told TOI.The auction takes place from 7 to 15 July.","Oil portrait believed to be the only painting Mahatma Gandhi ever sat for is going under the hammer at Bonhams in July with an estimate of £50,000-£70,000.

Adivasis say Project Tiger and tourism are displacing them from their ancestral land,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/adivasis-say-project-tiger-and-tourism-are-displacing-them-from-their-ancestral-land/articleshow/121578694.cms,"Picture credit: ©Sartaz Ali Barkat/Survival





TOI correspondent from London: Indigenous communities across India are being pushed out of their ancestral lands in the name of tourism and expansion of tiger projects whilst the laws to protect them are being diluted and not implemented properly, Adivasis told a global press briefing on Monday.“They say India has got freedom. But I think Adivasi people have not yet got freedom,” J C Shivamma, from the Jenu Kuruba tribe, said at the online event organised by Community Network Against Protected Areas.She is among the 52 households who reoccupied their ancestral land within Nagarhole tiger reserve on May 5, 35 years after their families were forcibly evicted.“Some of our family members died when in the plantations, but our sacred deities, our graveyard, everything that concerns us, is still in the village, so we used to go back to bury our people in our ancestral land, but it was always a fight with the forest department toconduct rituals. We consider our ancestors to be on the lands, they become deities and this way we were tortured. If we have to die, we will die on our ancestral land,” she said.Shivu JA recalled how their houses were burnt and elephants brought to destroy their fields when they were evicted from Karadikallu. “This land is ours. It's not any tiger project or scheme of the govt for tiger conservation,” he said.“Our elders are very happy now.We are having our food, we are going for honey collection. We have our own water resource. We sit together in the evening, and they are teaching us songs. All these songs and lessons were silenced for 40 years.""“The forest department keeps saying that only after your rights are recognised, you can live on this land. We already have these rights,” he said.The Jenu Kurubas are filing a case against the Forest Department under the SC/ST Atrocities Act for withholding their rights and filing an appeal against 39 rejected forest rights claims.“Why are their rights not being recognised despite the notification of central legislation such as the Forest Rights Act 2006,” asked scholar Nitin Rai.“People across the country in different states are fighting the same battles. It is important to find a way to raise a collective voice for what is happening all over,” said lawyer Lara Jesani.","Indigenous communities across India are being pushed out of their ancestral lands in the name of tourism and expansion of tiger projects. 52 households reoccupied their ancestral land within Nagarhole tiger reserve on May 5, 35 years after their families were forcibly evicted.

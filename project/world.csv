What is Trump derangement syndrome?







The partnership between Tesla CEO Elon Musk and US President Donald Trump seems to have now cracked. The verbal spat and insults between once allies have been seen all over the internet, with each responding to the other's text.I n response to Musk's critique of the president's spending legislation, which he termed a ""pork-filled Congressional spending bill"" and a ""disgusting abomination"", Trump offered his comments on Thursday. Musk, who recently stepped down from his position as special employee heading the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), had previously contributed approximately £275 million to Trump's campaign.During a Thursday press briefing in the Oval Office, Trump expressed uncertainty about their future relationship despite claiming they ""have a great relationship"". He expressed surprise at the turn of events, noting that at a May 30 press conference marking Musk's departure, they had shared a ""wonderful sendoff"" where Musk ""said wonderful things about me"".Trump expressed disappointment, pointing out that Musk was familiar with the bill's details and hadn't raised objections until after his departure.“I’m very disappointed because Elon knew the inner workings of this bill. He never had a problem until right after he left.”Trump said that others who have left his administration “at some point they miss it so badly” and “some of them actually become hostile. I don’t know what it is, it’s sort of ‘Trump derangement syndrome,’ I guess they call it,” the president said. “They wake up in the morning, the glamor is gone, the whole world is different, and they become hostile.”Trump derangement syndrome was firstly coined by Trump, which he explained as the instinctual negative and often violent reaction to any supportive statement or event related to him.Not only him but also Musk has used the term while giving an interview in February. He called the left “Trump Derangement Syndrome,” and said that he didn't realise it was a real thing until he was at a friend’s dinner party before the presidential election.During a Fox News interview with Sean Hannity, Elon Musk, describing about his friend’s dinner party a month or two ago, compared Trump Derangement Syndrome with rabies.""This whole thing they call Trump Derangement Syndrome - you don’t realize how real it is until you see it. You can’t reason with people,"" Musk said.Strangely, a bill was proposed in Minnesota seeking to classify intense opposition to Donald Trump, termed ""Trump derangement syndrome"", as a mental health condition.The legislation specifically describes this condition as involving ""verbal expressions of intense hostility toward"" Donald Trump and ""overt acts of aggression and violence against anyone supporting [Trump] or anything that symbolises [Trump].""This legislative initiative raises serious concerns about constitutional freedoms, particularly the right to criticise public officials. It potentially creates a precedent for using psychiatric interventions as a means of controlling political dissent. This situation draws parallels to previous instances where mental health practitioners expressed concerns about Trump's psychological state, suggesting he had a serious personality disorder.It is important to note that legitimate psychiatric diagnoses require proper examination by qualified, licensed mental health professionals. The practice of politicians attempting to pathologise their opponents through legislation, as well as mental health professionals offering remote diagnoses of public figures, presents significant risks to societal well-being and professional integrity.","US President Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk have been involved in a verbal spat.

'Necessary to protect our sovereignty': US sanctions four ICC judges for rulings on US and Israel; assets frozen,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/necessary-to-protect-our-sovereignty-us-sanctions-four-icc-judges-for-rulings-on-us-and-israel-assets-frozen/articleshow/121662986.cms,"US secretary of state Marco Rubio (Image credits: AP)





The US would impose new sanctions targeting four judges from the International Criminal Court (ICC), secretary of state Marco Rubio announced in response to investigations into the military actions and arrest warrants issued against Israeli leaders.""The United States will take whatever actions we deem necessary to protect our sovereignty, that of Israel and any other US ally from illegitimate actions by the ICC,"" Rubio said in his statement.He said that the sanctions were a direct response to what he called illegitimate actions by the ICC against both the US and its ally Israel. The four judges named are Solomy Balungi Bossa of Uganda, Luz del Carmen Ibáñez Carranza of Peru, Reine Adelaide Sophie Alapini Gansou of Benin, and Beti Hohler of Slovenia.According to the state department, Judges Bossa and Ibáñez Carranza authorised the ICC’s investigation into US personnel in Afghanistan. Although the investigation was allowed to proceed at the time, it was later dropped. Khan, after taking office in 2021, announced he would not pursue allegations involving US military or CIA personnel.Judges Alapini Gansou and Hohler, meanwhile, were part of the panel that authorised arrest warrants for Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defense minister Yoav Gallant over actions taken during the war in Gaza.Under the sanctions, all US-based assets belonging to the four judges must be frozen and reported to the treasury department. Americans are also prohibited from conducting business with them. Previous sanctions against ICC officials led to complications in banking and international travel, and some American staff at the court have since resigned.This move follows earlier sanctions imposed in February, when the US penalised ICC chief prosecutor Karim Khan for pursuing charges related to Israel’s military campaign in Gaza. The sanctions reportedly disrupted the work of Khan’s team.The US and Israel are not members of the ICC and have long opposed the court’s efforts to investigate their officials or military personnel. During US President Donald Trump 's first presidency, former secretary of state Mike Pompeo imposed similar sanctions when the court moved to investigate alleged war crimes by US troops in Afghanistan.The ICC strongly condemned the new sanctions, calling them ""a clear attempt to undermine"" an institution that seeks to provide justice to victims of severe crimes. In a statement, the court said such measures ""only emboldens those who believe they can act with impunity.""Established in 1998, the ICC is the world’s top criminal court, tasked with prosecuting war crimes, genocide, crimes against humanity, and aggression. The court depends on member states to enforce its rulings, as it has no power to carry them out on its own.The Rome statute, the treaty that created the ICC, has been ratified by 125 countries. However, some of the world’s most powerful nations, including the US, China, Russia, India, and Israel, are not parties to the treaty and do not recognize the court’s authority.""I call on the countries that still support the ICC, many of whose freedom was purchased at the price of great American sacrifices, to fight this disgraceful attack on our nation and Israel,"" he added.","US secretary of state Marco Rubio announced new sanctions against four judges from the International Criminal Court.

Feud between Musk and Trump







A few days back, people were talking about the bromance between US President Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, but now their messy breakup has put the internet in front-row seats. Naturally, the memes came fast and furious.As the once-rosy relationship between Trump and Musk turned ugly in public on Thursday with exchanged insults and threats across their respective platforms, X and Truth Social. It all started with Musk criticing Trump over ""One Big Beautiful"" Bill.As they got engaged in ugly divorce, social media lit up with jokes and memes comparing the fallout to iconic feuds — from the backstabbing drama ofto the lyrical warfare between Drake and Kendrick Lamar.""The big beautiful bill led to the big beautiful breakup,"" one user quipped on X, Musk’s own platform, referencing the domestic policy dispute that triggered the clash. Anther posted, ""This is like Drake and Kendrick for republicans, the girls are fighting, Elon is crashing out!”The online discourse included ""Alien vs. Predator"" parodies and the familiar ""two monkeys knife fighting"" scene from ""The Simpsons"". Republicans Against Trump simply stated, ""I'm running out of popcorn.""Historian Ruth Ben-Ghiat cautioned against becoming too engrossed in the social media conflict: ""People, don't let the dramas of these out of control men distract you from the main developments.

Trump-Musk feud: Have all Epstein files been released? What we know so far,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-musk-feud-have-all-epstein-files-been-released-what-we-know-so-far/articleshow/121662578.cms,"Jeffrey Epstein and US President Trump

Have all Epstein files been released

What's next

Who was Jeffrey Epstein?





The long-murky Epstein files returned to the spotlight in early 2024, this time due to a public accusation by Tesla CEO, Elon Musk. In a social media post, Musk claimed that US President Donald Trump was named in documents related to Jeffrey Epstein, the disgraced financier and convicted sex offender. Musk offered no proof, but the statement reignited public interest in the long-secret files.“Epstein files” refer to thousands of documents, videos, and investigative materials gathered over the years in connection with Epstein and his associates. While some court records from his 2008 Florida plea deal and his 2019 federal charges in New York had been made public, many others remained sealed or heavily redacted.In February, US attorney general Pam Bondi, in conjunction with the FBI, declassified and publicly released files related to Epstein’s sexual abuse of more than 250 underage girls at his homes in New York, Florida, and other locations. The first phase of declassified files largely consisted of materials that had previously leaked through unofficial channels but had never been formally released by the US government.The first batch of documents released earlier this year contained mostly previously known information. These included pilot logs from the prosecution of Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s so-called “black book,” and a redacted list of masseuses. The logs had already been public for years and were redacted to conceal the identities of potential victims.One newly revealed document, however, stood out: a three-page “Evidence List” compiled by the justice department, reportedly documenting items recovered during searches of Epstein’s properties in New York and the Virgin Islands. According to the list, investigators seized dozens of recording devices, computers, hard drives, and memory sticks.Also included were a CD labeled “girl pics nude book 4,” a folder marked “LSJ logbook,” believed to refer to Epstein’s private island, and a photo album described as “photo album of girl and Epstein.”Investigators also recovered several massage tables, one of which was presented during Maxwell’s trial, along with a bag containing a set of copper handcuffs and a whip. Another item, a bag holding a yellow envelope marked “SK” dated August 27, 2008, contained multiple smaller envelopes with a total of $17,115 in cash. The date corresponded with the period when Epstein was in jail in Palm Beach, Florida.Still some files are still not out. Many court documents, particularly from Epstein’s 2008 Florida case and the 2019 charges in New York, have been made public, but others remain sealed or redacted.Despite these revelations, the FBI has not confirmed that Trump’s name would appear in the newly released materials. Musk, too, has not clarified which documents he was referring to, and no official source has substantiated his claim.FBI director Kash Patel and deputy director Dan Bongino later confirmed in a Fox News interview that they had reviewed the full file. They maintained that Epstein died by suicide and stated that surveillance footage from his jail cell would be made public in the coming months.The Department of Justice has announced forthcoming releases, potentially including Epstein's jail surveillance footage, though no timeline has been specified. Whilst Bondi maintains that victim protection necessitates the delay, various right-wing commentators and Trump supporters interpret this as deliberate obstruction.Despite widespread demands from different political factions, there are currently no initiatives to make public the complete roster of names linked to Epstein's case documentation.The public's distrust is expected to intensify unless additional documents become available or the DOJ provides a direct response to Musk's allegations.Jeffrey Epstein, whose wealth and business operations remained largely opaque, was known for his connections to a range of powerful figures, including US presidents, British royals, and Hollywood elites. He pleaded guilty in Florida in 2008 to child prostitution charges and served 13 months under a controversial work-release agreement. In 2019, he was arrested again on federal sex trafficking charges for allegedly running a network that exploited underage girls. Weeks later, he was found dead in his Manhattan jail cell. Though his death was officially ruled a suicide, persistent theories have suggested he was murdered to protect powerful individuals implicated in his crimes.Trump, who built much of his political identity on promises to dismantle the “deep state,” had often hinted at exposing hidden government corruption, sometimes alluding to Epstein. As president, he authorised the release of thousands of pages tied to the JFK assassination, but did not do the same with Epstein-related files.Musk and Trump, once aligned politically, are now openly feuding. Their rift began over a new government tax bill, with Musk calling it a “disgusting abomination.” Trump responded on Truth Social, claiming he had excluded Musk from federal EV policy decisions and threatened to revoke subsidies. Musk fired back on X, calling Trump’s claims “an obvious lie” and asserting that Trump’s 2024 campaign would not have succeeded without his support—deepening the divide between the two former allies.","Elon Musk claimed that US President Donald Trump was named in documents related to Jeffrey Epstein, the disgraced financier and convicted sex offender.

Impact on vital research

Political tensions and retaliation claims





Harvard University on Monday asked a federal judge to issue a summary judgment ordering the unfreezing of $2.5 billion in federal research funding that has been halted by the Trump administration, which Harvard says is illegal.The university contends that the freeze jeopardizes over 950 critical research projects, including those related to national security and public health.In a filing with the US district court in Boston, Harvard argues that the funding suspension is both unlawful and politically motivated. The university asserts that the freeze violates its rights to free speech and due process and undermines academic independence.Trump has been attempting to force change at Harvard and other top American universities, because of his view that these have been captured by the left-wing woke and has led to the rise of antisemitism.The Trump administration has not yet responded to this latest move by the university.US district judge Allison Burroughs has set July 21 for the arguments on the Harvard case seeking summary judgement, which refers to a request to the judge to decide a dispute without a trial to determine material facts.The funding freeze affects a wide array of research initiatives, including studies on cancer, infectious diseases, and biological threat awareness for the department of defence. A defence advanced research projects agency (DARPA) official highlighted in court documents that canceling a $12 million grant for biological threat research at Harvard could pose ""grave and immediate harm to national security.""Additionally, the freeze threatens research in areas such as pediatric HIV and dark energy, potentially hindering advancements in both medical and scientific fields.Harvard's legal challenge comes amid escalating tensions with the Trump administration. The university alleges that the funding freeze is a retaliatory measure following its refusal to comply with a list of demands from the White House, which included changes to hiring practices and student discipline regulations.Besides, multiple other investigations have been opened into Harvard, including some looking into threats against Jewish students and faculty after pro-Palestine protests broke out following the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack on Israel.Further escalating the situation, the administration attempted to revoke Harvard's certification under the student and exchange visitor program, effectively barring the university from enrolling international students. This move was temporarily halted by a federal judge, but it has added to the university's concerns about political interference in academic affairs.","Harvard University has asked a federal judge to order the unfreezing of $2.5 billion in federal research funding halted by the Trump administration.

What is Autopen? Signature device used by Biden to sign pardons; Trump orders inquiry,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-is-autopen-signature-device-used-by-biden-to-sign-pardons-trump-orders-inquiry/articleshow/121638983.cms,"What is Autopen and how does it work?



'Autopen is biggest political scandal in American history': Trump



Trump questions Biden's pardons



Here is a list of the former president's most controversial pardons:

Hunter Biden:

Biden pardons siblings:

Gen. Mark Milley, Dr Anthony Fauci:





The mechanical signature device known as the autopen, which received its first patent many years ago, has recently become a subject of political controversy due to US President Donald Trump 's assertions about Joe Biden 's alleged usage for signing pardons.Trump ordered an investigation Wednesday into whether former President Biden's administration used an autopen machine to sign key presidential documents like pardons.In a memo signed Wednesday night, Trump told Attorney General Pam Bondi and the president's counsel to probe what he claimed was a ""conspiracy"" to ""abuse the power of Presidential signatures through the use of an autopen to conceal Biden's cognitive decline.""An autopen is a mechanical device designed to recreate authentic signatures by physically manipulating a pen. Unlike stamps or digital signature prints, these machines can accommodate various writing instruments, from ballpoint pens to permanent markers, as listed in product specifications for commercially available autopens, Fox News reported.Contemporary autopen systems enable users to store signature patterns on portable devices like smart cards or USB drives for easy transfer to the machine.The signing process begins when a pen is inserted, and the signature is executed by pressing a button or using a foot pedal to activate the mechanism.In March, President Trump contested that if Biden employed an autopen for signing preemptive pardons for House select committee members who investigated the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack, those pardons would be considered ""void"" and ""vacant.""Earlier, President Trump reiterated his concerns on Truth Social, stating ""With the exception of the RIGGED PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 2020, THE AUTOPEN IS THE BIGGEST POLITICAL SCANDAL IN AMERICAN HISTORY!!!""Interestingly, the device was also used to replicate a person’s signature and has been used by past presidents including Thomas Jefferson, John F Kennedy, and Barack Obama to sign ceremonial or routine documents when unavailable.The Heritage Foundation's Oversight Project, a conservative organisation, has also scrutinised this matter, suggesting that Biden's supposed autopen usage, considering his ""clear cognitive decline ... raises additional questions for investigators.""In his concluding weeks as president, Biden extended clemency and pardons to over 1,500 people, which his administration characterised as the most extensive single-day clemency action by any American president. Questioning Biden's mental acuity and decision-making authority, Trump asserted that he was unaware of the documents' contents when using the automated signing device. This raised concerns about his cognitive state during his presidency and his direct involvement in official decisions. administration.While Biden personally signed his son Hunter's pardon, the remaining pardons appear to have been executed using an autopen.In December 2024, former President Joe Biden issued a pardon to his son Hunter, contradicting his earlier promises to the American public. Hunter Biden had been convicted of three felony firearm offences during Special Counsel David Weiss' investigation, alongside federal tax charges for failing to pay over $1.4 million. Prior to his trial, Hunter entered an unexpected guilty plea.On January 19, 2025, just before leaving office, Biden granted clemency to his siblings James, Valerie, and Francis, along with their spouses. The pardons covered potential non-violent offences from January 1, 2014, through to the signing date. The House investigation revealed that Biden family members and associates had received over $27 million from foreign sources since 2014. Additionally, the family allegedly obtained more than $8 million in loans from Democratic supporters during Biden's vice presidency.On January 19, 2025, Biden also pardoned former General Mark Milley, Dr Anthony Fauci, and members of the January 6 House Select Committee. These pardons extended to committee staff and police officers who provided testimony. All pardons appeared to be signed using an autopen.","Autopen is a mechanical device designed to recreate authentic signatures by physically manipulating a pen.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk agreed with Pershing Square Capital Management CEO Bill Ackman's call for peace, saying he is ""not wrong.""In a post on X, Ackman appealed for reconciliation between Donald Trump and Elon Musk after the feud escalated over ""ne Big Beautiful"" Bill. As a Trump supporter ahead of the November 2024 election, Ackman has requested that both influential figures ""should make peace for the benefit of our great country. ""Replying to the post, Musk said, ""You’re not wrong.""The conflict between Trump and Musk intensified when Trump suggested cancelling government contracts and subsidies for SpaceX and Tesla. In response, Musk declared SpaceX would discontinue its Dragon spacecraft and advocated for Trump's removal from office. Trump took to social media, suggesting that cutting Musk's government support would reduce expenditure, whilst questioning Biden's inaction on this matter.The implications of Trump's statements are significant for Musk's enterprises, as both Tesla and SpaceX rely heavily on federal support and contracts. Considering these companies' vital contributions to American aerospace and defence sectors, any contract termination would face substantial legal obstacles.Musk subsequently suggested that Trump's connections to the Jeffrey Epstein case might explain certain document suppressions, making direct references to Trump's presence in the Epstein files.A key area of disagreement centres on Trump's tax reform legislation, particularly its provisions to eliminate electric vehicle tax credits. Musk contends this would increase the national deficit and has criticised Republican support for the measure. Trump expressed frustration at Musk's opposition, claiming Musk had been consulted about the bill. Musk refuted this, stating he never saw the legislation before its rushed overnight passage.This growing antagonism between Trump and Musk reveals the intricate political landscape within the Republican Party, where leaders must balance the influence of wealthy contributors against party cohesion. This situation demonstrates the difficulties political figures face in reconciling major donors' interests with broader party and national objectives.","Pershing Square Capital Management CEO Bill Ackman appealed for reconciliation between Donald Trump and Elon Musk.

After Elon Musk revived the contentious conspiracy theory on US President by connecting Donald Trump to Jeffrey Epstein , White House called it 'an unfortunate episode'.Reacting to the fallout, White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said that the Tesla chief executive's dissatisfaction stems from the One Big Beautiful Bill's exclusion of his preferred policies.Leavitt stated: ""As a businessman, [Musk] has a right to speak for his companies, but as POUTS, President Trump has a responsibility to fight for this country."" She emphasised the One Big Beautiful Bill as ""the most historic piece of legislation"" in recent times.The technology entrepreneur, who recently departed from his advisory position at the White House, claimed on Thursday that classified government documents about Epstein's influential associates contain references to the Republican leader.The administration has confirmed its review of extensive documentation, including videos and investigative materials, which Trump's 'MAGA' supporters believe will expose public figures involved in Epstein's criminal activities.Musk posted on X: ""Time to drop the really big bomb: (Trump) is in the Epstein files,"" amid an escalating public disagreement with the president. He added: ""That is the real reason they have not been made public.""Trump's more conspiracy-minded supporters suggest that government officials and others concealed the involvement of Epstein's associates in his crimes.These supporters typically direct accusations towards Democrats and Hollywood personalities, rather than Trump. No official source has verified the president's presence in any documentation.Musk provided no supporting evidence for his assertion and did not specify which files he referenced. The allegation has prompted Democrats to demand the release of these materials, attempting to redirect a MAGA conspiracy theory against its originators.Epstein died by suicide in 2019 in a New York prison whilst facing sex trafficking charges.Trump has rejected claims of visiting Little Saint James, Epstein's private island in the US Virgin Islands, where prosecutors allege he trafficked underage girls.Before his election, the president expressed willingness to release Epstein-related files.

Harvard University on Thursday took a legal route to challenge US President Donald Trump's ban on foreign students. The Ivy League university amended its lawsuit and said that it will ask the court to immediately halt the enforcement of the proclamation.""Singling out our institution for its enrollment of international students and its collaboration with other educational institutions around the world is yet another illegal step taken by the Administration to retaliate against Harvard,"" Harvard president Alan M. Garber said in a letter to the campus community.""As you know, we recently obtained a temporary restraining order enjoining the Administration’s illegal revocation of Harvard’s Student Exchange Visa Program (SEVP) certification. Last night’s proclamation circumvents that court order. Today, we have amended our lawsuit and will ask the court to immediately halt the enforcement of the proclamation. We hope the court will act swiftly,"" he added.The Harvard president also said that they are working on plans to ensure that international students and scholars can continue to pursue their work at Harvard this summer and through the coming academic year.School leadership will provide updates on this planning.Additionally, the Harvard International Office will be in touch directly with students and scholars who may be affected by the proclamation, also issued last night, banning travel of citizens from certain countries to the United States.Recent developments have intensified the feud between Trump and the University. On Wednesday, Trump issued a directive aiming to prevent US entry for Harvard's international students, potentially affecting thousands scheduled to arrive at the Cambridge, Massachusetts campus for summer and fall terms.Harvard's subsequent legal challenge questioned Trump's use of federal law allowing him to restrict a ""class of aliens"" deemed harmful to national interests. The university argued that targeting only Harvard-bound students fails to constitute a ""class of aliens"".""The President's actions thus are not undertaken to protect the 'interests of the United States,' but instead to pursue a government vendetta against Harvard,"" the university wrote.The administration's heightened scrutiny of student visas nationwide has created widespread uncertainty. Earlier this spring, thousands of students temporarily lost their US residency permissions before the decision was reversed.

Democrats demanded the release of Jeffrey Epstein's file after Tesla CEO and Doge's former chief, Elon Musk, dropped the bomb, making a striking allegation against US President Donald Trump.In a post on X, the Democrats, taking advantage of the Trump-Musk feud, have demanded to kill the ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" and release the Epstein file.Elon Musk Thursday alleged that Trump's name is in the Epstein Files and that's the reason why the administration is not releasing the list.In a post on his own platform X, Musk wrote, “Time to drop the really big bomb: @realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT!”""Mark this post for the future. The truth will come out,"" he further added.In his post, Musk's 'big bomb' allegations is something different, not just casual or social association, though Tesla CEO did not provide any insight into his claim. It seems that he hints that more truths about Epstein and Trump's associations are in the unreleased files.Epstein files encompass numerous court documents, particularly court records, connected to Jeffrey Epstein, a financial executive and convicted sex offender who passed away in 2019.These records, predominantly from Virginia Giuffre's 2015 defamation case against Ghislaine Maxwell, an Epstein associate, contain flight records, witness statements, contact directories and additional evidence linked to Epstein's conduct. The files identify several prominent individuals who maintained social, professional or other connections with Epstein.The presence of names in these documents does not automatically suggest misconduct, as numerous individuals encountered Epstein in casual social settings.The US Department of Justice, under Attorney General Pam Bondi, has disclosed these documents progressively, with substantial portions made public in January 2024 and February 2025.This is not a hidden fact that Trump's name is in these documents, particularly within flight manifests of Epstein's private aircraft, the ""Lolita Express."" Documentation shows Trump travelled on this aircraft seven times during 1993-1997, predominantly between Palm Beach, Florida, and New York City.These journeys included his former spouse Marla Maples, their daughter Tiffany, a nanny, whilst Jeffrey Epstein was listed amongst passengers on several occasions.Epstein accuser Johanna Sjoberg's statement references an occurrence in 2001 when Epstein's aircraft was redirected to Atlantic City, whereupon Epstein proposed visiting one of Trump's gambling establishments. Trump's details appear in Epstein's contact directory alongside other notable individuals including Ivana Trump and Mick Jagger.In a 2002 interview, Trump described Epstein as a 'terrific' guy, though he subsequently separated himself from association following the emergence of accusations against Epstein.Trump and Musk, once political allies, are now embroiled in a public feud sparked by disagreements over the government’s 'ne Big Beautiful' bill. Musk sharply criticised the legislation, calling it “a disgusting abomination” and urging Americans to “kill the bill.” In response, Trump expressed his disappointment, claiming he had cut Musk out of key EV policy decisions and stripped him of influence in Washington.","Elon Musk Thursday alleged that Trump's name is in the Epstein Files and that's the reason why the administration is not releasing the list.

Diddy trial: Sean Combs' ex-girlfriend in sex-trafficking case; says initial 'passionate nights' opened 'Pandora's box',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/diddy-trial-sean-combs-ex-girlfriend-in-sex-trafficking-case-says-initial-passionate-nights-opened-pandoras-box/articleshow/121659698.cms,"Sean ""Diddy"" Combs





A former girlfriend of Sean ""Diddy"" Combs testified on Thursday about the evolution of their relationship, which began as a passionate affair but, according to her, turned into a series of unwanted and coercive voyeuristic encounters. Her account follows Combs’ recent apprehension on sex-trafficking and racketeering charges.Identified only as ""Jane"" and granted anonymity by the court, the witness described how what started as consensual intimacy eventually became something she could not escape.""It was a door that I was unable to shut for the remainder of the relationship,"" she said, according to the New York Times.Jane said their private interactions were initially ""passionate"". But the tone shifted when Combs brought her to a Miami hotel suite, where staff had prepared the space with crimson lighting and refreshments. She recalled one encounter involving an escort service provider, during which Combs watched. Although she found the experience exciting and unconventional at first, she said Combs began arranging similar encounters more frequently.""I truly felt that that night opened a Pandora's box,"" she recounted.Jane's testimony marks a significant development in the federal case against Combs, following earlier allegations made by Casandra Ventura, also known as Cassie, his former girlfriend of 11 years. Ventura’s accusations of physical and sexual abuse helped launch the criminal investigation into Combs.Jane described drug-influenced sexual encounters with male escorts in hotel rooms across the country. According to her, furniture in the rooms was often covered in linens to protect against excessive baby oil. She testified that Combs frequently watched and engaged in self-gratification while she was with the escorts.The prosecution alleges that both Ventura and Jane were forced into these scenarios through a combination of physical violence, financial manipulation, and threats involving recorded footage of the encounters. Prosecutors argue that Combs orchestrated each situation in detail.Jane also revealed she became financially dependent on Combs after receiving significant monetary gifts and rental assistance.Her testimony began with a description of their initial meeting in late 2020 in Miami, where she was traveling with an acquaintance romantically involved with Combs. She went on to describe the beginning of their private relationship, which included private jet travel, use of ecstasy and ketamine, and prolonged intimate encounters. According to Jane, Combs also controlled what she wore- typically revealing lingerie and stilettos.","Former girlfriend of Sean ""Diddy"" Combs testified on Thursday about the evolution of their relationship.

‘Donald Trump tariffs will cause a recession’: Elon Musk's big warning; Tesla loses $150 billion,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-tariffs-will-cause-a-recession-elon-musks-big-warning-tesla-loses-150-billion/articleshow/121659705.cms,"



Elon Musk warned that US President Donald Trump’s aggressive new tariffs could plunge the country into a recession by the second half of this year, as tensions between the two former allies erupt into a full-blown political and personal feud. “The Trump tariffs will cause a recession,” Musk posted on X, signalling a dramatic break from the president he once helped elect and advised.The fallout sent shockwaves through financial markets, with Tesla’s stock plunging over 14% on Thursday, wiping out nearly \$150 billion in market value. The drop came just hours after Trump publicly attacked Musk, accusing him of turning against the administration over changes to a key tax and spending bill. “I’m very disappointed in Elon,” Trump told reporters, claiming the Tesla CEO had praised the bill before it was passed.Musk shot back, accusing Trump of “ingratitude” and denying he had ever seen the bill. “False. This bill was never shown to me even once and was passed in the dead of night,” Musk posted. He later added, “Without me, Trump would have lost the election… Such ingratitude.”In an escalation that stunned Washington, Musk alleged without evidence that Trump’s name appeared in unreleased Jeffrey Epstein files.“Time to drop the really big bomb: @realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public,” he wrote.The row intensified after Trump threatened to terminate government contracts with Musk’s companies. In response, Musk announced that SpaceX would begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft—one that had recently rescued two stranded NASA astronauts. “In light of the President’s statement… SpaceX will begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately,” he posted.Republicans are now scrambling to contain the fallout. House Rep. Ryan Zinke warned the clash could jeopardise Trump’s sweeping tax and immigration bill, calling the standoff “the fight of the egos”. Speaker Mike Johnson attempted to calm tensions, texting Musk and urging that “policy differences shouldn’t be personal”.The public breakdown between the world’s richest man and the most powerful political figure in the US has stunned observers, particularly given Musk’s major financial support for Trump’s 2024 campaign and his role in the administration.","Elon Musk warns that US President Donald Trump’s aggressive new tariffs could plunge the country into a recession by the second half of this year.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif has urged the US to broker a ""comprehensive dialogue"" between India and Pakistan. Addressing an event at the US embassy in Islamabad on Wednesday, Sharif lauded US President Donald Trump for what he said was his role in defusing a four-day military clash last month that was triggered by the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack that claimed 26 lives. India has rejected all claims of a US role in bringing about a cessation of hostilities.Sharif's praise for Trump as a leader ""against escalation and war"" was mirrored by Pakistan Peoples Party chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari in Washington. Bilawal credited Trump's diplomacy for the ceasefire and suggested that US mediation could facilitate broader talks. ""If America can help sustain this ceasefire, its role in arranging a comprehensive dialogue would benefit both nations,"" he said. This appeal to Trump's deal-making persona has sparked suspicion in India, where analysts see it as Pakistan's attempt to shift focus from its alleged role in cross-border terrorism and regain diplomatic leverage.Sharif's call for dialogue signals willingness to engage but raises questions about Pakistan's commitment to India's concerns, especially after dismissing the Simla Agreement and seeking US involvement.","Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif has urged the US to broker a ""comprehensive dialogue"" between India and Pakistan.

"Over 200,000 Afghans forced to leave Pakistan amid intensified deportation drive; Iran ramps up expulsions too",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/over-200000-afghans-forced-to-leave-pakistan-amid-intensified-deportation-drive-iran-ramps-up-expulsions-too/articleshow/121626249.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: ANI)





More than 200,000 Afghans have left Pakistan since April as Islamabad ramped up its deportation campaign targeting undocumented migrants, with Iran also increasing expulsions, raising concerns over Afghanistan’s capacity to manage the influx.According to Pakistan’s ministry of interior, over 135,000 Afghans left the country in April, followed by 67,000 in May, and more than 3,000 in just the first two days of June. The repatriation drive, which began in November 2023, has now seen over one million Afghans return from Pakistan, reported news agency ANI, citing ARY News.The deportation campaign is aimed at more than 800,000 Afghans whose residency documents have been revoked. Among them are individuals born or raised in Pakistan. Islamabad has accused Afghan nationals of links to terrorism and blamed Kabul for harbouring militants, a charge the Taliban authorities have repeatedly denied.Farmer Mohammad Wali, who crossed into Afghanistan via the southern Spin Boldak border, was quoted by AFP as saying, “We left behind our orchards... but we said to ourselves, ‘If we stay, maybe one day we’ll lose our dignity.’”With Eid al-Adha approaching, the pace of returns has slightly slowed, though crossings continue daily.Iran, meanwhile, is pushing ahead with similar measures. The UN's International Organisation for Migration (IOM) recorded 15,675 Afghan deportations from Iran in May, more than double the figure in April.The IOM expressed alarm at the increasing number of families, rather than single men, being sent back, calling this “a new and concerning trend.”In late May, Iranian authorities ordered undocumented Afghans to leave by July 6—a move that could impact as many as four million people, according to AFP. Already, more than 450,000 Afghans have returned from Iran since January.Both nations host millions of Afghan refugees who fled decades of conflict.But as economic conditions worsen and political tensions rise, public support for Afghan migrants has diminished. Pakistan, which still hosts around three million Afghans, has also warned it may revoke the UNHCR-issued refugee cards of 1.3 million cardholders by the end of June.The IOM has repeatedly urged countries to “immediately suspend the forced return of Afghans... until safe, voluntary, and dignified return conditions are in place.”The Taliban authorities, who remain internationally unrecognised, have echoed the call, asking for returns to occur in a “dignified” manner.Analysts view the deportation moves, particularly by Pakistan, as politically driven. Islamabad is under pressure to address domestic security threats, especially in border regions plagued by insurgencies.However, rights groups and humanitarian agencies warn that Afghanistan’s already fragile infrastructure is ill-equipped to absorb such a massive and sudden return of people.","More than 200,000 Afghans have left Pakistan since April as Islamabad ramped up its deportation campaign targeting undocumented migrants.

Baloch human rights group Paank strongly condemned the killing of two Baloch men whose bodies were found in Kalat, calling it another disturbing sign of growing violence and repression in the region.Samiullah, son of Muhammad Hanif, and Bismillah, son of Ghulam Sarwar, both residents of Padang Abad in Mastung district, were found dead on 3 June in the Ganda Gain neighbourhood of Sheikhri, Kalat. According to Levies officials, both men had been brutally shot, their bodies discarded and later transported to RHC Mangochar for formalities.Paank, in a post on X said, “Forcibly disappeared by Pakistani security forces on May 29, 2025, their executions are a glaring testament to the ongoing horrors of enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings in Balochistan, a despicable violation of humanity that must be stopped.”The rights organisation said 2025 has already seen a surge in such cases. In February alone, Paank documented five extrajudicial executions and 33 enforced disappearances. Among the victims were Bashir Ahmad Marri and Arman Marri, who were reportedly executed in a staged encounter after being abducted in 2023.The group also referred to the tragic case of Rehana, who was shot dead in Awaran while trying to prevent her husband’s kidnapping.In April, Mehrab and Khan Mohammad were tortured to death in Kech after disappearing earlier in the month, while the tortured body of Sher Khan Nazar was discovered in Turbat two days after he went missing.Most recently, Zabid Ali, a resident of Chaghi, was abducted from his home on 11 May.In a separate post on X, Paank demanded the safety and recovery of three members of the family who “were forcibly disappeared in Pidarak area in Kech district.”On June 3, 2025, Pakistani security forces allegedly carried out a series of enforced disappearances in the Pidarak area of Kech district, Balochistan. Among those abducted from their homes were Sinkandar Baloch, son of Muhammad Anwar; Siddique Sabzal, son of Sabzal Baloch; and Ibrahim Yaqoob, son of Yaqoob Baloch. All three men were reportedly detained without any legal process, and their whereabouts remain unknown.Enforced disappearances remain one of Balochistan’s most alarming human rights crises. International watchdogs such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have repeatedly urged the Pakistani state to investigate these abuses and take meaningful steps to end the practice, which leaves families traumatised and communities in fear.","Samiullah and Bismillah were found dead on 3 June in the Ganda Gain neighbourhood of Sheikhri, Kalat.

'Vindictive nature': Imran Khan levels fiery charge at Asim Munir; alleges army chief targeted his wife,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/vindictive-nature-imran-khan-levels-fiery-charge-at-asim-munir-alleges-army-chief-targeted-his-wife/articleshow/121616395.cms,"Pakistan On Knees, Pleads India To Withdraw This Decision; ‘Reconsider Blocking…’ | Watch





NEW DELHI: Former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan has accused army chief general Asim Munir of waging a personal vendetta against his wife, Bushra Bibi.In a social media post on Monday, Khan claimed the alleged animosity dates back to his decision to remove Munir from his position as Director General of Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) during Khan's tenure.In a social media post on Monday, Khan claimed that following Munir's dismissal, the general attempted to contact Bushra Bibi through intermediaries, but she refused, stating she ""had no involvement with such affairs."" Khan attributed his wife's 14-month imprisonment and alleged mistreatment to ""General Asim Munir's vindictive nature.""Khan further asserted that Bushra Bibi, a private citizen with no political role, has been falsely accused and arrested repeatedly without evidence. “The way my wife has been targeted for personal vengeance is unprecedented. Even during Pakistan’s darkest periods of dictatorship, such a thing never happened,” he said, noting he had not been allowed to meet her in four weeks, despite a scheduled June 1 meeting.Turning his criticism toward the military-backed government and judiciary, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chief accused authorities of suppressing democratic dissent and rigging the political system.He blamed the events of May 9, 2023—when military installations were attacked—on a so-called “London Plan” aimed at dismantling PTI. “Our democratic mandate was brazenly stolen, and corrupt individuals — Sharifs and Zardaris — were imposed upon the nation,” he said.Khan alleged that anti-terrorism courts and judges are complicit in the crackdown on his party and deliberately ignoring key evidence. “Despite repeated demands, they refuse to summon or examine the stolen CCTV footage from May 9, 2023… We are innocent. Our people are being sentenced without evidence and without the right to a fair trial.”Calling for a judicial commission, Khan demanded investigations into the deaths of unarmed pro-democracy protesters on May 9 and November 26, 2024. He also lashed out at the judiciary, comparing current Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa to the widely criticised Justice Munir, saying the institution is “driven not by justice but by a desire to protect their own jobs and privileges.”Khan’s remarks come days after a court sentenced 11 PTI supporters, including a lawmaker, for violence and vandalism on May 9 last year—an incident triggered by his arrest.The 72-year-old PTI founder has been in Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi since mid-2023, facing multiple legal cases.","Imran Khan has accused army chief general Asim Munir of waging a personal vendetta against his wife, Bushra Bibi.

A routine safety measure after earthquake tremors turned into a major security breach in Karachi, as over 100 inmates escaped from prison on Tuesday.Officials said the prisoners had been evacuated from their cells as a precaution following a series of mild earthquakes in the area, but chaos erupted when a group of inmates attacked guards, seized their weapons, and managed to flee.According to senior police official Kashif Abbasi, 216 inmates escaped from Malir prison before dawn. He confirmed that 78 of them had already been caught.Police teams were carrying out raids to find the rest. “No one convicted or facing trial as a militant is among those who fled,” Abbasi said.The escape led to a shootout in which one inmate was killed and three security personnel were injured. “The situation has been brought under control,” Abbasi added.Sindh’s home minister, Ziaul Hassan, explained how the jailbreak unfolded. The inmates had been moved out of their cells due to tremors. While they were still outside, some prisoners attacked the guards and fled the premises after opening fire.Prison Superintendent Arshad Shah said the escapees headed towards nearby residential areas. Residents reported that police later used mosque loudspeakers to warn them about the escaped inmates and requested help in identifying and reporting them.Sindh chief minister Murad Ali Shah made a televised appeal, urging the escapees to turn themselves in. “They had only been involved in minor crimes until that point,” he said. “But they could face terror charges if they are arrested by police on the jailbreak charge.”Although prison escapes have happened during court transfers in Pakistan, such mass breakouts from within prison walls remain rare.Karachi has experienced multiple earthquakes in the past 24 hours, with magnitudes ranging from 2.6 to 3.4, according to the National Seismic Monitoring Center.", 216 inmates escaped from Malir prison in Karachi on Tuesday morning.

'Water is Our New Red Line': Pakistan Army Chief Warns India Over Indus Waters Treaty Suspension

NEW DELHI: Pakistan is staring at a bleak kharif (summer crops) sowing season with a major dip in live storage at its two key dams - Mangla on river Jhelum and Tarbela on Indus - and the ""sudden decrease"" in Chenab river inflows due to regulation of water flow by India in the aftermath of the Pahalgam terror attack.The situation may further aggravate this month during early kharif sowing and this is possibly what prompted Pakistani PM Shehbaz Sharif to raise concerns at a conference on glacier preservation in Dushanbe, Tajikistan, last week to draw global attention to India's decision to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty Latest estimates by Pakistan's Indus River System Authority (IRSA) show the country is already facing an overall shortage of 21% in water flow and around 50% in live storage of the two key dams which play a crucial role in providing water for irrigation in Punjab and Sindh provinces of Pakistan and generating hydropower.Referring to its latest assessment of availability of water for summer sowing operations during May-Sept, the IRSA in its statement ""noted with concern"" that the ""sudden decrease in river Chenab inflows at Marala due to short supply by India would result in more shortage in early kharif season"".It declared an overall shortage of 21% and advised dam authorities and irrigation supply monitoring agencies to use water from reservoirs judiciously, ""keeping in view the crisis created by Indian short supplies in Chenab river"".Though the situation may improve with monsoon rainfall in the catchment area, possibly by next month, Pakistan's farming operations will depend more on how India regulates the flow through limited infrastructure of its own reservoirs - Baglihar and Salal - on the Chenab in Jammu and Kashmir.India has, so far, only flushed these reservoirs and made additional water storage available by clearing sediments. Besides, it also stopped sharing water flow data with Pakistan after putting the 1960 treaty in abeyance following the Pahalgam massacre.Publicly available information on live storage of Pakistan's critical reservoirs shows that Mangla dam is currently left with less than 50% of its fill level (2.7 million acre feet out of the total capacity of 5.9 MAF) whereas Tarbela dam's live storage is slightly over 50% (6 MFA) of its total capacity of 11.6 MFA.Officials here believe that since India is under no obligation to share water flow data with Pakistan after suspending the IWT, it would be difficult for the neighbouring country to even manage floods during the peak flow season once monsoon hits the catchment areas of the Indus river system as a large part of it falls within India.Farming operations in two provinces of Pakistan, Punjab and Sindh, fully depend on irrigation canals linked to the Indus river system, which gets almost its entire waters from the western rivers — Indus, Jhelum and Chenab. Though India has full rights on the waters of eastern rivers (Ravi, Sutlej and Beas) under the IWT, inadequate infrastructure to use the waters by the Indian side benefits Pakistan.India is permitted to construct water storage facilities on western rivers up to 3.6 MAF but has not been able to fully utilise this, making Pakistan a beneficiary by default.","Pakistan is staring at a bleak kharif (summer crops) sowing season.

(NYT News Service)





HINGOL NATIONAL PARK, PAKISTAN: When Amar Faqira's 3-year-old son abruptly lost movement in his foot last year, doctors offered little hope.As panic gripped his family, Faqira made a vow - if the boy recovered, he would make a 200-mile pilgrimage through blistering plains and jagged terrain to the Hinglaj Devi temple, a site sacred to the Hindu minority in Pakistan. It is also where Pakistan's largest annual Hindu festival is held, usually in mid-April.When the child regained strength a year later, Faqira set off in late April on a seven-day walk to the temple, nestled deep in the rust-coloured mountains of the restive Balochistan . The goddess ""heard me and healed my son,"" Faqira said before the trek, as he gathered with friends and family in his neighbourhood in Karachi. ""Why shouldn't I fulfill my vow and endure a little pain?""Faqira and two companions, wearing saffron headscarves and carrying a ceremonial flag, joined thousands of others on the gruelling journey to Hinglaj Devi. Along a winding highway and sun-scorched desert paths, groups of resolute pilgrims - mostly men but also women and children - trudged beneath the unforgiving sky, in heat that reached 45Celsius. Some bore idols of the deity, and all chanted ""Jai Mata Di"" .The pilgrimage is an act of spiritual devotion as well as cultural preservation. Pakistan's Hindus number about 4.4 million and make up less than 2% of the country's population, which is more than 96% Muslim.Hindus are often treated as second-class citizens, systemically discriminated against in housing, jobs and access to govt welfare.For many, the pilgrimage to Hinglaj Devi is comparable in significance to the Haj in Islam, a once-in-a-lifetime obligation of faith. The yearning to make the journey is also strong among Hindus in India though it is very difficult for Indians to receive visas to travel to Pakistan. States bordering Pakistan have deep spiritual links to Hinglaj Devi that are rooted in traditions predating the Partition.For much of the 20th century, the Hinglaj Devi temple remained inaccessible. The pilgrimage gained momentum only in the 1990s. A transformative shift came in the early 2000s with the construction of the Makran Coastal Highway, which links the rest of Pakistan to the Chinese-operated Gwadar deep-sea port.The highway brought unprecedented access to the temple -- it became possible to make the bulk of the journey by vehicle, taking some of the sweat out of the endeavour. Still, thousands continue to make the journey by foot. They are considered the more spiritually devoted. ""The real pilgrimage is in the pain, the feeling,"" said Faqira on the fourth day of his trek.One of his two companions collapsed from heat exhaustion after walking nearly 70 miles and had to return home by bus. Faqira carried on, his feet blistered and bandaged. Each pilgrim walks with a personal vow.Minakshi, part of a group of women dressed in yellow and red, undertook the journey to ask the goddess for a son. Nearby, 60-year-old Raj Kumari was making her seventh pilgrimage, praying for her grandson's well-being. Also on the trek was a childless couple, married since 2018.Hinglaj Devi temple is one of the sites where the remains of Sati, goddess of marital devotion and longevity, fell to Earth after her self-immolation. For many of the faithful, the pilgrimage begins with a symbolic trek to a sacred mud volcano rising from the barren landscape near the Makran Coastal Highway. At the summit, devotees toss coconuts and rose petals into the bubbling crater to seek divine permission to proceed. Many also smear volcanic clay on their faces and bodies. The next stage takes pilgrims to the Hingol River for a ritual bath. From there, they continue 28 miles to the Hinglaj Devi temple, set within a natural cave.The complex houses four shrines, the most revered being the Nani Mandir. After reaching the shrines, devotees complete the pilgrimage with an arduous, hourslong trek across seven mountains, before returning to the temple to pray.","Hinglaj Devi temple is a site sacred to the Hindu minority in Pakistan. Pakistan's Hindus number about 4.4 million and make up less than 2% of the country's population. For many, the pilgrimage is comparable in significance to the Haj in Islam, a once-in-a-lifetime obligation.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121544231,imgsize-1405202,width-400,resizemode-4/121544231.jpg"

DHAKA: Bangladesh foreign affairs adviser Md Touhid Hossain Tuesday accused India of declaring ""people"" foreigners and ""pushing"" them into his country without following the process of deportation. Dhaka will send a diplomatic note to New Delhi on the issue, he said.The deportation of illegal Bangladeshis by India started following a nationwide verification drive after the April 22 Pahalgam attack and picked up pace since Operation Sindoor was launched on May 7.Under the deportation process, each case is being reviewed individually and only verified citizens will be repatriated, but ""India is resorting to cross-border push ins"", Hossain said. ""We will send a new, substantive letter,"" he stated, adding. ""We see that push-ins are still happening. But it is not something we can physically stop.""India has provided Bangladesh with a list of individuals it claims are Bangladeshi nationals.

Here's how the escape took place:





In a meticulously orchestrated operation, former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina departed Dhaka on August 5, 2024, under a veil of secrecy, amid escalating political unrest. She landed at Hindon Airport in India.Hasina's aircraft remained the most tracked plane that day. As per real-time data from the flightradar24 website, Bangladesh Air Force aircraft AJAX1431 become the most tracked plane globally, with over 29,000 people following its route at one point of time.The Bangladesh Air Force's Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft, designated AJAX1431, took off from Bangabandhu Airbase at 3.09pm, officially listed as a training flight. To obscure its trajectory, the aircraft's transponders and automatic geolocator systems were deactivated until it neared Indian airspace over West Bengal, The Daily Star reported citing sources.Upon approaching Indian airspace, AJAX1431 reactivated its transponders at waypoint ""BEMAK"" and altered its course from Kolkata to Hindon Air Force Base in Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh.This clandestine departure occurred just 30 minutes before protesters seized the Gono Bhaban, Hasina's official residence.Army Chief General Waker-uz-Zaman, unaware of Hasina's departure, was preparing to announce her resignation. In a later interview, he acknowledged the volatile situation and the potential risks to Hasina's life had she remained in the country.""When I was holding discussions with the political parties, somebody informed me that she is going to exit the country, she is on the run. I did not know that she was leaving the country. I think that if she had stayed, it could have been a risk to her life. Definitely, nobody would have wanted an extra-judicial killing to have happened. The situation was extremely volatile,"" he said.","Sheikh Hasina left Dhaka on August 5, 2024, amid escalating political unrest. She landed at Hindon Airport in India.

Bangladesh's Supreme Court on Sunday ordered the Election Commission to restore the right-wing Jamaat-e-Islami's party registration, nearly eight months after the interim govt lifted a ban on it, clearing the way for its participation in future elections.Court officials said the SC's appellate division, led by chief justice Syed Refaat Ahmed, directed the commission to restore the party's registration.The apex court said it was up to EC to decide if Jamaat could contest polls using its traditional ""scale"" symbol.EC scrapped the registration of Jamaat, which was opposed to Bangladesh's 1971 independence from Pakistan, in Dec 2018 in line with a HC ruling. In 2013, SC cancelled the registration of the Jamaat-e-Islami, saying the party is unfit to contest national elections.Former PM Sheikh Hasina's govt slapped a total ban on the party days ahead of her ouster on Aug 5, 2024 in a violent mass movement led by a platform called Students against Discrimination (SAD).Jamaat and several other parties had backed SAD.After Hasina's ouster, the party appealed for a review of the 2013 court order banning it.""Today concludes the decade-long legal battle.

India's First Reaction After Bangladesh Bans Sheikh Hasina's Awami League Party

Proceedings aired live, a first for Bangladesh





DHAKA: Prosecutors at Bangladesh's International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) on Sunday formally charged former prime minister Sheikh Hasina and two others with crimes against humanity and other charges, including mass murder, for their alleged role in a violent crackdown last year in which hundreds of people were killed.The other two charged for the crimes with Hasina are former home minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal and former inspector general of police (IGP) Chowdhury Abdullah Al Mamun.""We do hereby take into cognisance the charges,"" the three-judge ICT bench led by Justice Golam Mortuza Majumdar said after a prosecution team accused them of attempting to tame the student-led protests using brutal force. The tribunal ordered investigators to present all three accused before the court on June 16. Mamun is in police custody. Hasina and Kamal are residing abroad.Sunday's proceedings marked the start of Hasina's trial in absentia nearly 10 months after the ouster of her government following protests. Under ICT law, if convicted, Hasina and the co-accused could face the death penalty.The proceedings were broadcast live on television for the first time in Bangladesh’s history.The complaint, submitted by chief prosecutor Tajul Islam, outlined five counts of alleged crimes, including murder, attempted murder, torture and other inhumane acts.The accused are also charged with abetting, inciting, facilitating and being complicit in, as well as failing to prevent, a series of crimes reportedly committed against civilians by law enforcement agencies and armed affiliates of the Awami League. One count specifically refers to a violent crackdown on unarmed student demonstrators, which allegedly followed a press briefing by Hasina on July 14. Prosecutors claim that in the aftermath, Kamal, IGP Mamun and other senior government officials were directly involved in enabling and overseeing the assault.“Upon reviewing the evidence, we concluded that it was a coordinated, widespread and systematic attack,” Islam told the court. “The accused unleashed all law enforcement agencies and her (Hasina’s) armed party members to crush the uprising.”The ICT was set up by Hasina in 2009 to investigate crimes committed by the Pakistani army during Bangladesh’s war for independence in 1971. Six top leaders of Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami and one leader of former PM Khaleda Zia’s Bangladesh Nationalist Party were hanged to death after being convicted by the court. According to a UN rights office report, some 1,400 people were killed between July 15 and Aug 15 last year as violence continued even after the fall of Hasina’s Awami League regime.","Proceedings aired live, a first for Bangladesh.

Bangladesh unveiled new currency designs, marking a significant change on Sunday.The notes no longer feature the image of its first president, who was also the father of exiled former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, ousted from power last year.The nation is home to around 170 million people and is presently under caretaker administration following Hasina's departure, coinciding with the commencement of her trial on Sunday for allegedly suppressing the August 2024 uprising against her leadership.Previously, all currency notes displayed the image of her father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who governed Bangladesh from its independence from Pakistan in 1971 until his assassination, along with most family members, during a military takeover in 1975.""Under the new series and design, the notes will not feature any human portraits, but will instead showcase natural landscapes and traditional landmarks,"" Bangladesh Bank spokesman Arif Hossain Khan told AFP.The revised designs in this predominantly Muslim country incorporate imagery of Hindu and Buddhist religious structures, alongside historical buildings.The artwork includes pieces by the renowned artist Zainul Abedin, illustrating the Bengal famine during British rule.One design features the national memorial honouring those who sacrificed their lives in the independence conflict with Pakistan.The central bank released three of nine denominations on Sunday.""The new notes will be issued from the central bank's headquarters, and later from its other offices across the country,"" he added.""The other denominations of the notes with new designs will be released in phases"".The current notes and coins will continue to be valid alongside the new currency. This alteration reflects previous changes influenced by political shifts.The initial currency from 1972, after the country's renaming from East Pakistan, featured a geographical representation.Subsequent notes displayed Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, leader of the Awami League, which Hasina later headed during her 15-year administration. During periods of alternative leadership, particularly under the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), the notes featured cultural and archaeological sites.The Awami League received a ban last month pending legal proceedings against Hasina and other party officials. Hasina, aged 77, currently resides in India by choice, refusing to comply with an extradition request for her trial attendance.","Bangladesh unveils new currency designs, marking a significant change.

Sri Lankan customs officials arrested a woman on Friday after seizing the largest quantity of cocaine ever intercepted at the country’s main international airport.The suspect is a 38-year-old Thai national whose identity has not been disclosed.They were found carrying nearly 10 kilograms (22 pounds) of cocaine concealed inside three soft toys, according to Customs Additional Director-General Seevali Arukgoda.“This is the biggest attempt at cocaine smuggling stopped by Sri Lanka Customs at the airport,” Arukgoda said.The cocaine was packed into over 500 plastic capsules and was discovered at Bandaranaike International Airport.The capsules are estimated to have a street value of $1.72 million. Customs officers posed with the seized drugs in official photos following the operation.This bust comes amid a series of recent drug interceptions in Sri Lanka. Earlier in the month, customs officials confiscated nearly 60 kilograms of synthetic cannabis across three separate incidents.

The relationship between King Charles and Prince Harry has reportedly deteriorated beyond repair, leaving little hope for a royal reconciliation.The 76-year-old monarch has maintained a reserved stance whilst being physically separated by 5,459 miles from his younger son, following Harry and Meghan Markle 's withdrawal from royal duties in 2020.The father-son relationship has deteriorated to such an extent that palace sources believe reconciliation is now improbable between the royal family members, according to the New York Post.""There is no turning back,"" royal expert Hilary Fordwich told Fox News. ""King Charles remains tender towards his son but can't risk communication. Prince William now has absolutely no interest in mending fences.""According to Fordwich, the king's confidants advise against reconciliation with his son as it could potentially impact Prince William's future sovereignty. ""The animosity is so deep that William has shut the door on Harry. Charles is not willing to go against his heir's wishes,"" she added.The fundamental issue remains one of trust between the parties. A palace source informed The NY Post about the king's distrust of Harry, specifically referencing the Duke of Sussex's revealing BBC interview, which reportedly destroyed their remaining trust.Recent reports suggest the king, who is battling cancer, remains reluctant to repair relations with the 40-year-old son.""The king and William don't trust Harry and Meghan with any kind of confidential conversation,"" royal biographer Sally Bedell Smith told People, adding that ""the underlying issue is trust.""NY Post sources also indicate Prince William, Harry's estranged brother and heir to the throne, shows no inclination towards reconciliation. Meanwhile, the palace sources further claim that Camilla is attempting to remain uninvolved in the situation.A royal commentator recently suggested that the duke's only chance at family reconciliation would require maintaining a ""dignified silence"".This report comes just days after revelations that during delays in obtaining UK passports for their children Archie and Lilibet, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle considered adopting the Spencer surname, being Harry's mother's Diana's maiden name.The Duke of Sussex initiated discussions with his uncle Earl Spencer regarding a potential family surname modification, an action that potentially strained relations further with the royal establishment.The family currently utilises Sussex as their surname, and reports indicate they submitted UK passport applications for Archie and Lilibet, aged six and four respectively, using Sussex alongside HRH (His/Her Royal Highness) titles.According to sources speaking to The Guardian, prolonged delays in passport approval led Harry and Meghan to suspect resistance towards their children's HRH titles, prompting the duke to seek counsel from his uncle.Contrasting accounts have emerged regarding Earl Spencer's stance. Whilst the Mail on Sunday suggested Princess Diana's brother cautioned against the change, citing significant legal obstacles, sources close to Harry and Meghan refute this. The Guardian's reporting indicates Earl Spencer displayed enthusiasm and support for the proposed surname modification.","King Charles and Prince Harry's relationship has reportedly deteriorated beyond repair.

: An oil portrait believed to be the only painting Mahatma Gandhi ever sat for is going under the hammer at Bonhams in July with an estimate of £50,000-£70,000 (Rs 58 lakh to Rs 81 lakh. )It is the first time this portrait has ever been sold at auction as it remained in British artist Clare Leighton’s collection until her death in 1989, after which it was passed down through her family.Leighton, reputed for her wooden engravings, was introduced to Gandhi when he visited London in 1931 to attend the Second Round Table Conference.At the time, she was in a relationship with political journalist Henry Noel Brailsford, who was a passionate supporter of Indian Independence. He had travelled to India in 1930 where he met key Independence figures. Afterwards he published the book “Rebel India”, met Gandhi in London in 1931 and introduced Leighton to him. She became one of very few artists admitted to his office and was given the opportunity to sit with him to sketch and paint him in 1931.In Nov 1931 Leighton showcased her portraits at the Albany Galleries in London.The following month, Gandhi's personal secretary, Mahadev Desai, wrote a letter to Leighton, a copy of which is attached to the backing board, which reads: “It was such a pleasure to have had you here for many mornings doing Mr Gandhi’s portrait.”According to the artist’s family, the portrait was on public display in 1974 when it was allegedly attacked with a knife by a Hindu right-wing activist. The catalogue entry states: “We have found no documentation to corroborate this, but the painting shows signs of restoration to what appears to be repaired tears in several places. A label attached to the backing board confirms the painting was restored in 1974 by the Lyman Allyn Museum Conservation Laboratory. ”“There is nothing comparable to this painting in existence as it was painted in his lifetime and was a painting that he sat for on multiple occasions,” Rhyanon Demery, head of sale, told TOI.The auction takes place from 7 to 15 July.","Oil portrait believed to be the only painting Mahatma Gandhi ever sat for is going under the hammer at Bonhams in July with an estimate of £50,000-£70,000.

But I think Adivasi people have not yet got freedom,” J C Shivamma, from the Jenu Kuruba tribe, said at the online event organised by Community Network Against Protected Areas.She is among the 52 households who reoccupied their ancestral land within Nagarhole tiger reserve on May 5, 35 years after their families were forcibly evicted.“Some of our family members died when in the plantations, but our sacred deities, our graveyard, everything that concerns us, is still in the village, so we used to go back to bury our people in our ancestral land, but it was always a fight with the forest department toconduct rituals. We consider our ancestors to be on the lands, they become deities and this way we were tortured. If we have to die, we will die on our ancestral land,” she said.Shivu JA recalled how their houses were burnt and elephants brought to destroy their fields when they were evicted from Karadikallu. “This land is ours. It's not any tiger project or scheme of the govt for tiger conservation,” he said.“Our elders are very happy now.We are having our food, we are going for honey collection. We have our own water resource. We sit together in the evening, and they are teaching us songs. All these songs and lessons were silenced for 40 years.""“The forest department keeps saying that only after your rights are recognised, you can live on this land. We already have these rights,” he said.The Jenu Kurubas are filing a case against the Forest Department under the SC/ST Atrocities Act for withholding their rights and filing an appeal against 39 rejected forest rights claims.“Why are their rights not being recognised despite the notification of central legislation such as the Forest Rights Act 2006,” asked scholar Nitin Rai.“People across the country in different states are fighting the same battles. It is important to find a way to raise a collective voice for what is happening all over,” said lawyer Lara Jesani.","Indigenous communities across India are being pushed out of their ancestral lands in the name of tourism and expansion of tiger projects. 52 households reoccupied their ancestral land within Nagarhole tiger reserve on May 5, 35 years after their families were forcibly evicted.

Summer drought risk







LONDON: The UK experienced its warmest spring on record, and its driest in more than 50 years, the country's official weather service said on Monday.Temperatures for the season have been frequently elevated this century, according to the data from the Met Office, which said: ""Eight of the 10 warmest UK springs have occurred since the year 2000. ""The data ""clearly shows that recent decades have been warmer, sunnier, and often drier than the 20th century average,"" said Met Office scientist Emily Carlisle.The Met Office said provisional temperatures registered between March and May this year averaged 9.51 degrees Celsius (49.1 degrees Fahrenheit).That beat the last record, set in last year's spring, when the average was 9.37 degrees.The next warmest springs were in 2011, 2014 and 2007, according to the Met Office which has been recording temperature data since 1884.This year, the 128.2 millimetres (five inches) of rainfall recorded across the UK during the season was ""approximately 40 percent below the long-term average and still the driest spring in more than 50 years"", it said.""England was particularly dry, experiencing its driest spring in more than 100 years, beaten only by 1893,"" it added.The Met Office's Carlisle said: ""The UK's climate continues to change. What's particularly notable about spring 2025 is the combination of record warmth and sunshine, alongside very low rainfall.""""This spring shows some of the changes we're seeing in our weather patterns, with more extreme conditions, including prolonged dry, sunny weather, becoming more frequent,"" she said.The recent weather's dominant feature had been the persistent high-pressure systems, often coming from the Azores or mainland Europe.These had lingered over the UK since late February and blocked the usual flow of Atlantic weather fronts, allowing high pressure to dominate, the Met Office said.Last month, the Environment Agency (EA) called a meeting of its national drought group after it said levels in reservoirs were ""exceptionally low"".In the meeting, the EA's deputy water director, Richard Thompson warned that ""changing climate means we will see more summer droughts in the coming decades"".The agency added that, while there was no official drought yet, there was a ""medium risk"" of a summer drought without sustained rainfall.The UK government has said it would step in to fast-track the building of two new reservoirs.According to the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs, no new water reservoirs have been built since 1992.Scientists warn that extreme and fluctuating weather events are becoming increasingly common as planet-heating fossil fuel emissions keep rising.","The UK experienced its warmest spring on record, and its driest in more than 50 years.

L ONDON: A Turkish-born man who burned a Quran in London was on Monday found guilty of a religiously aggravated public order offence, in a case taken up by free-speech campaigners.Hamit Coskun, 50, shouted ""Islam is religion of terrorism"" and ""Quran is burning"" as he set the book alight outside the Turkish consulate in London last February 13.District Judge John McGarva at London's Westminster Magistrates' Court found Coskun guilty of using disorderly behaviour ""within the hearing or sight of a person likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress"".He was motivated by ""hostility towards members of a religious group, namely followers of Islam"", said McGarva, who issued Coskun a £240 ($325) fine, with a statutory surcharge of £96.""Your actions in burning the Quran where you did were highly provocative, and your actions were accompanied by bad language in some cases directed toward the religion and were motivated at least in part by hatred of followers of the religion,"" said the judge.State prosecutors insisted Coskun was not being prosecuted for burning the book.""He is being prosecuted for his disorderly behaviour in public,"" said Philip McGhee, for the Crown Prosecution Service.A passerby filmed the incident, which also showed a man, allegedly holding a knife or bladed item, approaching Coskun and appearing to slash out at him, the court heard.Coskun, an atheist who is currently claiming asylum in the UK, posted on social media that he was protesting against the ""Islamist government"" of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.His legal fees are being paid by the Free Speech Union (FSU) and the National Secular Society, which argued he was essentially being prosecuted for blasphemy, despite Britain's free-speech guarantees.The FSU called the verdict ""deeply disappointing"" on its X account.""Everyone should be able to exercise their rights to protest peacefully and to freedom of expression, regardless of how offensive or upsetting it may be to some people,"" it said.","Hamit Coskun, 50, shouted ""Islam is religion of terrorism"" and ""Quran is burning"" as he set the book alight outside the Turkish consulate in London last February 13.

Starmer Slams Badenoch For 'Echoing Kremlin Talk' In Heated UK Parliament Clash

Daily attacks:

Sophisticated challenge:





LONDON: Britain announced it will build 12 new attack submarines as it was set to unveil Monday a major defence review to deal with ""growing"" Russian aggression and the changing nature of warfare.Prime Minister Keir Starmer told BBC radio that ""there is greater instability on defence and security than there has been for many, many years, and greater threats.""His Labour government will later publish its Strategic Defence Review, a document that will assess threats facing the UK and make recommendations.The review warns that Britain is entering ""a new era of threat"" as drones and artificial intelligence transform modern warfare, The Guardian newspaper reported over the weekend.""I wanted a review that told me the challenges we're actually facing and likely to face for the foreseeable future,"" Starmer told the BBC Monday.""And the principles are clear: war-fighting readiness, integrating our forces... and a Nato first approach,"" he added.The UK has been racing to rearm in the face of the threat from Russia and fears that US President Donald Trump will no longer help protect Europe.Starmer said it would serve as ""a blueprint for strength and security for decades to come"".His government pledged in February to lift defence spending to 2.5 per cent of GDP by 2027 in the ""largest sustained increase in defence spending since the end of the Cold War"".And despite budget constraints, it aims for spending to rise to three per cent in the next parliamentary term, due in 2029.The Labour government has said it will cut UK overseas aid to help fund the spending.Based on the recommendations of the review, which is led by former Nato secretary general George Robertson, the government said Sunday that it would boost stockpiles and weapons production capacity, which could be scaled up if needed.This includes £1.5 billion ($2 billion) for building ""at least six munitions and energetics factories"", procuring 7,000 domestically built long-range weapons, and spending £6 billion on munitions over the current parliamentary term.The government also said late Sunday that it would build up to 12 new attack submarines as part of its Aukus military alliance with Australia and the United States, and invest £15 billion in its nuclear warhead programme.The defence ministry last week pledged £1 billion for the creation of a ""cyber command"" to help on the battlefield.""We're in a world that is changing now... and it is a world of growing threats,"" defence secretary John Healey told the BBC in an interview Sunday.""It's growing Russian aggression. It's those daily cyberattacks, it's new nuclear risks, and it's increasing tension in other parts of the world as well,"" he said.The last such defence review was commissioned in 2021 by the previous Conservative government, and was revised in 2023 after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.While launching the new review, Robertson said it would tackle threats from Russia, China, Iran and North Korea, calling them a ""deadly quartet"".But in an op-ed in The Sun newspaper, Starmer did not mention China, while warning that ""The Kremlin is working hand in hand with its cronies in Iran and North Korea.""The softer rhetoric on China is in line with the Labour government's efforts to thaw relations with Beijing, which reached new lows under former prime minister Rishi Sunak 's Conservative government.The review describes Russia as an ""immediate and pressing"" threat, but calls China a ""sophisticated and persistent challenge"", according to The Guardian.At a time when Washington is demanding that its Nato allies bolster their own defences, Britain is considering strengthening its deterrent by buying nuclear-missile capable aircrafts from the United States, The Sunday Times reported.Without confirming or denying, Healey said Sunday that ""strong deterrence is absolutely essential in order to keep Britain and the British people safe"".","UK to unveil major defence review to deal with ""growing"" Russian aggression.

UK Threatens To Sue Abramovich Over £2.5 BN Chelsea Sale As Russia-UK Tensions Escalate





LONDON: Sikh Federation UK has warned PM Keir Starmer it will campaign to no-platform Labour MPs from Aug 1 unless a judge-led public inquiry into Britain’s role in 1984’s Operation Blue Star is announced in Parliament by the end of July.No-platforming is a political strategy where people actively work to prevent certain politicians or public figures from speaking publicly, often due to disagreements with their views.The warning, delivered in a letter signed by 455 gurdwaras and Sikh organisations, follows a rally of more than 10,000 Sikhs at Trafalgar Square Sunday marking the 41st anniversary of the military operation at Amritsar’s Golden Temple against Sikh militants hiding there.Deputy PM Angela Rayner had publicly committed to the inquiry just before the 2024 general elections. Labour also promised it in two consecutive manifestos.The federation insists the inquiry must investigate both UK involvement in the Indian military operation and anti-Sikh actions in Britain during Margaret Thatcher’s tenure. It plans to contact every MP individually, asking them to confirm written support for a judge-led inquiry by July-end.The letter warns Starmer that failing to act “could have massive consequences for the re-election of many Labour MPs”, citing rising support for Reform UK and independent candidates. Sikh Federation UK also said it is in talks with Reform UK, Liberal Democrats, and SNP to secure broader political backing.Documents declassified in Jan 2014 showed Thatcher’s government sent an SAS officer to India in Feb 1984 after Indian officials requested help planning an operation to remove Sikh militants from the Golden Temple.In Feb 2014, then-cabinet secretary Jeremy Heywood concluded there was “no record of any assistance to the June 1984 operation other than the limited military advice provided in mid-February,” describing it as a “one-off”.Sikh Federation disputes this, citing its 2017 Sacrificing Sikhs report. “The papers released prove training and equipment was secretly provided by Britain before the Indian army assault in June 1984,” the letter says. “In addition, counter-insurgency training and equipment were provided to Indian army and police to deal with the Sikh uprising that followed the massacre. We are confident a judge-led public inquiry will prove the UK involvement had a massive rather than limited impact. ”",Sikh Federation UK has warned PM Keir Starmer it will campaign to no-platform Labour MPs from Aug 1 unless a judge-led public inquiry is announced in Parliament.

The number of migrants reaching the UK in small boats in a single day hits a 2025 high,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/the-number-of-migrants-reaching-the-uk-in-small-boats-in-a-single-day-hits-a-2025-high/articleshow/121549944.cms,"Representative image (AI)





LONDON: UK government figures Sunday showed that more than 1,100 migrants arrived in the country on Saturday in small boats from France across the English Channel, the highest number recorded on a single day so far this year.The latest Home Office figures show that 1,194 migrants arrived in 18 boats on Saturday in what were settled weather conditions, bringing the provisional annual total so far to 14,811.That's 42% higher than the same point last year, an increase that has piled pressure on the Labour government, which returned to power nearly a year ago, partly on disillusionment with the previous conservative administration's efforts to get a grip on the numbers making the crossing.Having ditched the Conservative government's plan to send migrants who arrived in the UK by unauthorized means to Rwanda, Prime Minister Keir Starmer said his government would get control by smashing the gangs and the business models that sustain their smuggling operations.Since gaining power, Starmer's government has sought better intelligence-sharing internationally, enhanced enforcement operations in northern France, and has adopted tougher rules in its immigration legislation.French police officers were seen watching Saturday as migrants boarded at a beach in Gravelines, between Calais and Dunkirk, and authorities were then pictured escorting the boats. French authorities said they rescued 184 people.""Pretty shocking, those scenes yesterday,"" defense secretary John Healey told Sky News.He added that it is a ""huge problem"" that French police are unable to intervene to intercept boats in shallow waters, adding that the UK is pressing for the French to put new rules into operation so they can intervene.""They're not doing it, but, but for the first time for years ... we've got the level of cooperation needed,"" he told Sky News. ""We've got the agreement that they will change the way they work, and our concentration now is to push them to get that into operation so they can intercept these smugglers and stop these people in the boats, not just on the shore.""Despite French and UK efforts, the cross-Channel route, one of the world's busiest shipping lanes, remains a major smuggling corridor for people fleeing conflict or poverty. Many migrants favor the UK for reasons of language, family ties or perceived easier access to asylum and work.The home office says 36,816 people arrived in the UK on small boats in 2024, 25% more than in 2023 (29,437). The highest number of arrivals was in 2022, with 45,774.","1,194 migrants arrived in 18 boats on Saturday in what were settled weather conditions.

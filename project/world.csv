‘Nuclear Sites Bombed’: ALARMING Escalation In Iran, Israel Clash After Mega Missile Mayhem

50 Iranian Ballistic Missiles ‘Smash’ Key Israeli Military Sites; Revenge After Nuke Sites Attack





Israel issued a stark warning to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, saying that he ""cannot continue to exist"" adding that the Israel Defence Forces had been instructed to ensure the same. This came after Iran, in its retaliatory strikes, attacked a hospital in Israel leaving nearly 40 injured on Thursday.“A dictator like Khamenei, who heads a country like Iran and has made the destruction of Israel his mission, cannot continue to exist,” Israeli defence minister Katz said. “The IDF has been instructed and knows that in order to achieve all of its goals, this man absolutely should not continue to exist,” he added.US President Donald Trump had earlier made it clear that the US had no plans to kill Khamenei, ""at least not for now"".""We know exactly where the so-called 'Supreme Leader' is hiding. He is an easy target, but is safe there - We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now. But we don’t want missiles shot at civilians, or American soldiers. Our patience is wearing thin. Thank you for your attention to this matter!"" he had said on Wednesday.An Iranian missile struck the main hospital in southern Israel, causing ""extensive damage"" but no serious injuries, according to the hospital. Other missiles hit a high-rise and residential buildings near Tel Aviv.At least 40 people were injured in the attacks, and emergency teams evacuated patients from Soroka Medical Center in Beersheba as black smoke rose from the site.On the seventh day of escalating conflict, Israel struck Iran’s Arak heavy water reactor, continuing its attacks on Iran’s nuclear program.The conflict began with surprise Israeli airstrikes targeting military sites, senior officers, and nuclear scientists.According to a US-based Iranian human rights group, at least 639 people, including 263 civilians, have been killed in Iran, with over 1,300 wounded. In retaliation, Iran has launched around 400 missiles and hundreds of drones, killing at least 24 people and injuring hundreds in Israel.","Israel issues stark warning to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, saying that he ""cannot continue to exist"" This came after Iran, in its retaliatory strikes, attacked a hospital in Israel leaving nearly 40 injured.

Noem curbs ICE access: DHS rules limit lawmakers' visits; Democrats accuse Trump of hiding abuses,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/noem-curbs-ice-access-dhs-rules-limit-lawmakers-visits-democrats-accuse-trump-of-hiding-abuses/articleshow/121964164.cms,"AP file photo





The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has issued new rules limiting how and when members of Congress can visit immigration detention centres. This comes after several tense visits by Democratic lawmakers.Under federal law, lawmakers can make unannounced visits to ICE facilities. But the new DHS policy requires them to give prior notice. It also limits the number of people per visit and says lawmakers must name specific detainees in advance and get signed privacy forms.“ICE will not facilitate meetings with detainees in detention facilities without valid, signed privacy releases. If Members and/or Congressional staff would like to meet with a specific detainee or set of detainees, please provide names, alien registration numbers, and valid, signed privacy releases with your request,” DHS stated.Tensions have been rising. In New Jersey, three Democratic lawmakers tried to visit Delaney Hall with Newark Mayor Ras Baraka. A scuffle broke out, and Baraka was arrested for trespassing. Charges were later dropped, but Rep. LaMonica McIver now faces charges of assaulting an officer during the clash. If convicted, she could face up to 17 years in prison.Senator Alex Padilla was also briefly handcuffed during a protest in Los Angeles where Noem was speaking.The Trump administration says the new rules are to protect privacy, but Democrats say it’s an attempt to hide the impact of harsh immigration policies.Rep. Jerry Nadler pushed back strongly against the new DHS restrictions, saying the Trump administration has no legal authority to block lawmakers from inspecting detention sites. He cited Section 527 of the 2024 Consolidated Appropriations Act, which allows members of Congress to inspect DHS-operated facilities without prior notice.Nadler in a post on X, said he had informed ICE in advance anyway, but the agency is now wrongly claiming that its field offices are exempt — even though migrants are being held there overnight, sometimes sleeping on the floor. “It doesn’t matter what ICE chooses to call a facility,” he said. “If it’s used for detention, Congress has the right to inspect it. Period.”","The US Department of Homeland Security has issued new rules limiting how and when members of Congress can visit immigration detention centres.

An Iranian ballistic missile struck the southern Israeli city of Beersheba on Friday, causing extensive damage near residential areas but no reported casualties. The missile hit just outside apartment blocks, igniting several vehicles and damaging nearby homes. Firefighters were deployed to control blazes at the scene.Sirens were activated across Beersheba and surrounding towns following the launch. The Israeli military confirmed that “sirens sounded in several areas across Israel following the identification of missiles launched from Iran toward the State of Israel,” and said interception efforts were underway.This strike comes a day after Iranian missiles hit a major hospital in southern Israel and residential buildings in Tel Aviv, wounding 240 people. Israeli defence minister Israel Katz blamed Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, stating, “the military has been instructed and knows that in order to achieve all of its goals, this man absolutely should not continue to exist.”Israel has since responded by targeting Iran’s Arak heavy water reactor, part of its nuclear infrastructure. Iranian state television said the facility had been evacuated in time, and “no radiation danger whatsoever” was reported.As the situation escalates, diplomatic efforts continue. British Foreign Secretary David Lammy said after meeting US officials that the Middle East “remains perilous,” and that a two-week window exists to avoid deepening conflict. Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi is due to meet European diplomats in Geneva.Meanwhile, Israeli airstrikes have reached deep into Iran, including the city of Rasht, while Iran remains under a near-total internet blackout.","Iranian ballistic missile strikes southern Israeli city of Beersheba.

Iran’s Fattah ‘KNOCKS DOWN’ Israeli Defences; New Ballistic Attack As Tehran Dubs Trump 'DELUSIONAL'





Lieutenant General Eyal Zamir, Chief of Staff of the Israel Defence Forces (IDF), told Israel's intelligence officers on Thursday that the country had turned Iran’s “ring of fire” against them — a reference to alleged years of Iranian preparation for attacks on Israel.""We are now turning the 'ring of fire' -- the sword that they built for years to attack us -- against them on their territory,"" Zamir told troops in the Intelligence Directorate.He went on to praised their efforts and described the current operations as transformative. “What we are doing here is historic — we are changing the face of the Middle East,” he said, adding that their success was being closely watched around the world.Zamir credited the team with “extraordinary capabilities,” calling them the people behind making the campaign possible.""Every citizen of this country, and the whole world, is looking at you with admiration and respect. Everyone wants to learn how this happened, and I'm telling you, there are miracles, and those that make them happen are people, and in this case, those people are you.""The statement followed his visit to the IDF’s Targeting Center, where officials said major operations had recently been carried out against Iranian positions, reported Jerusalem Post.Meanwhile, Major General Shlomi Binder said that the IDF struck Iran’s elite Quds Force heavily on the first night of operations. He said one covert headquarters in the mountains was destroyed, and hours later, another strike targeted the Chief of Staff of Khatam al-Anbiya — Iran’s main construction and engineering arm linked to its military — who had moved to a nearby location in Tehran.""Two days ago, thanks to excellent work by the headquarters and command and control array, we struck one of the regime's covert headquarters in the mountains. Some of the commanders managed to flee to a secondary location. Twelve hours later, we succeeded in striking the Chief of Staff of Khatam al-Anbiya, who had fled to the same secondary location in another mountain ridge in Tehran,"" he said.Binder said about 30 commanders had been targeted so far, with several senior names already made public. He stressed that the campaign would continue at full pace because Israel would not tolerate the threat.""We need to deliver, increase the pace, and that's exactly what we're doing,"" he said. ""Because this is the kind of threat that, I emphasise, the State of Israel cannot tolerate. Period.

‘All help is welcome’: Netanyahu opens door to US support in strikes on Iran’s nuclear sites,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/all-help-is-welcome-netanyahu-opens-door-to-us-support-in-strikes-on-irans-nuclear-sites/articleshow/121958815.cms,"Benjamin Netanyahu





Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday signaled openness to international support, including from the United States, in efforts to dismantle Iran’s nuclear infrastructure, nearly a week into Israel's sweeping aerial assault on the Islamic republic.In an interview with Israel's public broadcaster Kan, Netanyahu declared that Israel is “capable of striking all of Iran's nuclear facilities”, but added: “All help is welcome.”The comments come amid escalating regional tensions, as Israeli fighter jets continue pounding nuclear and military targets deep inside Iranian territory. The campaign was launched last Friday in response to what Israel called a “grave and immediate threat” from Tehran.When asked about the role of Washington, Netanyahu said he expected President Donald Trump to act in the interests of the US.“President Trump will do what is good for the United States, and I will do what is good for the State of Israel,” Netanyahu said.The remarks are being interpreted as both a declaration of military self-reliance and an invitation for American involvement, as Israel pushes deeper into Iranian territory with high-stakes strikes on key sites, including the Arak heavy water reactor earlier this week.While the US has thus far stopped short of joining the military offensive, senior American officials have reiterated Washington’s “ironclad” commitment to Israeli security. Meanwhile, Iran has warned that any further escalation, especially involving US forces, would trigger “unimaginable consequences.”Israel’s offensive has drawn mixed reactions globally, with some allies urging restraint while others back Israel’s right to self-defense.","Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel is ""capable of striking all of Iran's nuclear facilities"" Comments come amid escalating regional tensions, as Israeli fighter jets continue pounding nuclear and military targets deep inside Iranian territory.

They look just like real babies: Why reborn dolls are becoming so popular in the UAE?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/they-look-just-like-real-babies-why-reborn-dolls-are-becoming-so-popular-in-the-uae/articleshow/121930584.cms,"Each doll comes with clothes, bottles, diapers, a stroller, and even a car seat making them feel just like the real thing./ Image: Instagram @UAE.Doll





In the UAE, a unique trend is capturing attention, hyper-realistic baby dolls known as “reborn dolls.” These dolls look, feel, and weigh almost exactly like real babies but are entirely artificial. Increasingly, residents are purchasing them for various reasons: as collectors’ items, therapeutic aids, or simply for the novelty of their astonishing lifelike design.The rising popularity of reborn dolls in the UAE is reflected in the expanding customer base and shifting price points. A local seller operating under the Instagram account uae.doll shared her insights with local news outlet KT, explaining that prices currently range between Dh300 and Dh500. This marks a significant drop compared to the early days when these dolls first entered the market.“I started importing reborn dolls from Spain and noticed huge interest when I displayed them on Instagram,” she told KT. “The demand was so high that I began offering them regularly. Later, lower-quality versions became available from Chinese markets at more affordable prices.”Her clientele is notably diverse, spanning children, mothers, grandmothers, and even young men who sometimes purchase the dolls as gifts for their fiancées.Every doll comes equipped with a full range of accessories, including extra clothes, hairbands, bottles, diapers, a bag, stroller, and even a car seat.She added, “We began this business in 2014 when the dolls were much more expensive, starting from Dh2,000 and imported mainly from Spain and the United States.”Reborn dolls have not only found a place in private collections but have also become a social media phenomenon. Enthusiasts openly share their passion online, sometimes bringing the dolls into public spaces. One Instagram user posted near the Burj Khalifa, stating: “I already have four reborns and now we are in Dubai with the newest, his name is Chase.”Yet, the dolls’ striking realism can sometimes provoke discomfort. Sara, a 27-year-old Dubai resident, shared with KT that her curiosity led her to buy a reborn doll but she ultimately gave it away. “It looked so real that it started to freak me out, especially at night,” she said. “There were times I’d walk into the room and feel like there was an actual baby just lying there. I couldn’t handle it.”In contrast, some view reborn dolls as valuable educational tools. Layla, a mother from Sharjah, recently bought one for her nine-year-old daughter. “She’s been asking for a baby sister for years,” Layla explained. “This was the closest I could offer, and honestly, it’s helping. She changes the diaper, feeds it, puts it to sleep. It’s teaching her a sense of responsibility and care.”Both women agree on one thing: the level of detail is astonishing. From the doll’s weight to tiny eyelashes and hand-painted skin tones, and the incredibly realistic, indistinguishable hair, with every feature is crafted to mimic a real baby. Reborn dolls blur the line between a toy and lifelike art.The reborn doll phenomenon extends far beyond the UAE. Internationally, these dolls have sparked fascination and controversy, particularly in countries like Brazil. There, the hyper-realistic dolls serve multiple purposes, including grief therapy for individuals coping with loss and as practical tools for new parents learning infant care.The dolls have become a frequent topic on social media, attracting both devoted fans and critical observers. In Brazil, the trend has even spurred political debate. Some lawmakers have proposed restrictions on reborn dolls, citing concerns, while others defend the rights of collectors to engage freely with them.Reports have surfaced of owners bringing reborn dolls to hospitals and demanding real infant care, a phenomenon that has raised eyebrows and fueled further discussion.","In the UAE, a unique trend is capturing attention, hyper-realistic baby dolls known as “reborn dolls” These dolls look, feel, and weigh almost exactly like real babies but are entirely artificial.

'Stay Out!': Putin Aide Hints At Russia Joining Iran-Israel War If Trump Bombs Tehran's Nukes

'If You Join War...': Putin's EXPLOSIVE IRAN WARNING To Trump If He Bombards Nuke Sites

Mediator in the Middle East



Chaos pays







Just a decade ago, the world watched as Russia made a bold and high-stakes intervention in Syria. In 2015, when Bashar al-Assad’s regime stood on the brink of collapse, Russian fighter jets streaked across Syrian skies. That intervention not only saved Assad, at least temporarily, but also projected Moscow’s re-emergence as a power with teeth in the Middle East. Fast forward to 2025, and the scene today looks very different.Iran, one of Russia’s closest regional allies, is now under sustained attack from Israel. Over the past several days, Israeli strikes have hit Iranian missile facilities and suspected nuclear sites. And yet, the Kremlin’s response has been muted, even passive.While Moscow has issued the usual statements of concern and condemnation, it has shown no inclination to get involved militarily. This marks a sharp departure from the Syria playbook and reflects a significant recalibration of Russia’s Middle East policy.At the heart of Russia’s caution is its war in Ukraine. The ongoing conflict, Europe's biggest since World War II, is now in its third year, and has consumed much of Russia’s military capacity.Nikita Smagin, an expert on Russia-Iran relations, summed it up clearly: ""Russia, when it comes to Iran, must weigh the possibility of a clash with Israel and the United States, so saving Iran is obviously not worth it,"" Smagin was quoted as saying by the. In other words, the Kremlin has neither the resources nor the appetite for another major military adventure, especially one that risks confrontation with two formidable powers.Russia is also treading carefully because of its relationships with the Gulf monarchies—countries like Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar. These states, while wary of Israeli escalation, are deeply uncomfortable with a stronger Iran.Russia has worked hard to develop economic and energy partnerships with the Gulf, and intervening on Iran’s behalf could jeopardize those ties.There is also the recent memory of Syria itself. Although Russia initially managed to keep Assad in power through its intervention, the regime ultimately collapsed in December 2024. The collapse of Assad's regimemarked a painful and costly failure for the Kremlin. Years of military investment, political capital, and international pushback ended in defeat. Half a year later, Moscow is still picking up the pieces—and that experience weighs heavily on how it views the Iranian situation today.There’s no doubt that the collapse of Iran’s regime—which now appears to be an Israeli objective—would represent another major loss for Russia’s network of alliances in the region. It would join Iraq, Libya, and Syria on the growing list of countries where Moscow has seen its influence unravel. And yet, the Kremlin does not appear panicked. In fact, the current conflict may be playing into its hands in a different way.Unlike during the Syria crisis, where Russia had to use force to assert its presence, this time it is leveraging its position as a potential mediator. Vladimir Putin is currently the only major global leader with open lines to all three key players in this crisis: Iran, Israel, and the United States. That fact alone gives Russia significant diplomatic leverage. A report by CNN highlighted how Putin is already using that leverage behind the scenes. ""In a recent call to the White House, Putin reminded President Donald Trump how Russia has been a long-time US ally when it comes to the Iranian nuclear issue – a heavy hint that he is open to being one again."" The White House, CNN added, appears receptive to this possibility.""If it comes to some form of behind-the-scenes diplomacy, Russia is more likely to play a role between Iran and the United States — Israel’s interest in negotiations is not apparent,"" Fyodor Lukyanov, head of the Council on Foreign and Defense Policy, a think tank that advises the Kremlin, was quoted as saying in a report by the Bloomberg.Putin’s mediation efforts have already begun. The Russian president has reached out to both Iranian and Israeli leaders, offering to help de-escalate the situation. From Moscow’s perspective, being the indispensable broker is a way to exert influence while avoiding the risks that military intervention would entail.This broker role also aligns with Russia’s long-term economic interests. Tensions in the Middle East often lead to higher oil prices, something that benefits the Kremlin, which continues to rely heavily on energy exports to sustain its war in Ukraine.""While the oil price is high, Russia can get billions of dollars, potentially tens of billions of dollars in additional revenue, and this is always useful,"" Sergei Markov, a Kremlin-connected political analyst was quoted as saying by The Washington Post.By remaining diplomatically engaged but militarily uninvolved, Russia is preserving its influence in the region while quietly profiting from the instability.What we are seeing, then, is not a retreat by Russia, but a strategic pivot. In the past, influence in the Middle East meant projecting hard power—troops, jets, bases. Today, the Kremlin seems to believe it can do more with less. It is using the crisis not to save Iran in the traditional sense, but to reframe itself as the essential power for dialogue and de-escalation.Still, this approach carries risks. If Iran’s regime does fall, Russia will lose one of its few remaining allies in the region. Already, its footholds in Iraq, Libya, and Syria have receded, and Iran’s fall would deepen that trend. That could further isolate Moscow at a time when it is already under pressure from Western sanctions and a grinding war in Ukraine. But for now, the Kremlin appears to be betting that it can keep a foot in the door diplomatically, even as its military stays home.","Russia has shown no inclination to get involved militarily in the Iran-Israel conflict. This marks a sharp departure from the Syria playbook and reflects a significant recalibration of Russia’s Middle East policy.

RAMALLAH: Israeli troops raided two Palestinian refugee camps in the occupied West Bank's north overnight, the military told AFP, as Israel presses offensives on multiple fronts.The military told AFP that at ""around 4:00 am Israeli forces entered Balata camp"", near the northern city of Nablus, for ""a routine counter-terrorism operation"".It added that the troops had been deployed to the nearby Askar camp prior to the operation in Balata camp.Imad Zaki, head of the popular services committee of Balata camp, also told AFP that the military began its raid at 4:00 am (0100 GMT) on Wednesday.""They closed all entrances to the camp, seized several homes after evicting their residents, and ordered the homeowners not to return for 72 hours. These homes were turned into military outposts and interrogation centres,"" Zaki said.""The soldiers are conducting house-to-house and neighbourhood-to-neighbourhood searches, destroying the contents of homes and physically assaulting the residents,"" Zaki told AFP.He added that life had been ""largely paralysed"" for the camp's residents but that no injuries were reported.In a separate statement, the military said that its forces had ""neutralised"" one Palestinian overnight in the West Bank village of Al-Walaja near Jerusalem.They said that as the troops were deployed in the area, a Palestinian armed with a knife ""attempted to stab (Israeli) soldiers who were operating in the area and steal their weapons"".""The soldiers responded with fire and neutralised the terrorist,"" the army said, using a term it normally uses when someone has been killed.The Israeli military said Tuesday that its forces had been active in various parts of the Jenin area, in the northern West Bank.It said in a statement that its forces had arrested five Palestinian militants suspected of planning attacks on Israel.Throughout the Gaza war, violence in the West Bank -- a separate Palestinian territory -- has soared, as have calls to annex it, most notably from Israel's far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich.Since the start of the war in October 2023, Israeli troops or settlers have killed at least 939 Palestinians, including many militants, according to the Palestinian health ministry.Over the same period, at least 35 Israelis including civilians and soldiers have been killed in Palestinian attacks or during Israeli military raids, according to official Israeli figures.","Israeli troops raid two Palestinian refugee camps in the occupied West Bank's north overnight.

Engaging in fraudulent activities and sorcery with unknown individuals (whose phone numbers were later traced),



Endangering others,



Violating personal privacy by transmitting private images through WhatsApp,



Illegally possessing and distributing private materials.









A man in the UAE has been sentenced to six months in prison after being convicted of engaging in sorcery and violating the privacy of his estranged wife and her family. The Fujairah Court of Appeal upheld the initial ruling, which also included the confiscation and destruction of materials seized during the investigation.The case came to light after the wife filed a police report, accusing her husband of using black magic against her, their children, and her relatives. Her suspicions were confirmed when she was contacted by a spiritual healer who provided her with WhatsApp messages and photos that directly implicated her husband.According to a report by, the husband admitted during police interrogation that he had gone online in search of someone who could cast love spells to restore his failing marriage. He found a woman from another Arab country promoting herself on social media as an expert in “bringing back loved ones.” He contacted her via WhatsApp and paid her Dh20,000. As part of the ritual, he sent her personal images of his wife, a video of himself, and their phone numbers.Things took a turn when the woman demanded an additional Dh25,000. When he refused, she threatened to expose his actions by sending the compromising content to his wife.Undeterred by the threat, the man turned to another practitioner, paying Dh10,000 for a second attempt at spellwork. When that too failed, he contacted a third woman who didn’t initially request money, but before anything could proceed further, he was apprehended by authorities.Meanwhile, the wife had already moved out of their home two months earlier and had initiated divorce proceedings due to alleged abuse. Her suspicions regarding her husband's use of sorcery were further confirmed when a woman, believed to be connected to the earlier “spiritual healer,” contacted her from outside the UAE and offered evidence of his actions for Dh35,000. Refusing to pay without seeing proof, the wife was sent photos, a video, and images of magical rituals. These materials were handed over to the police.The Public Prosecution brought four formal charges against the man:These charges fell under the UAE’s cybercrime and fraud laws and were classified as misdemeanors.The initial court found the evidence compelling and handed down a six-month prison sentence, along with an order to confiscate and destroy the incriminating digital materials. The man appealed the ruling, denying all charges in court. However, the appellate court rejected his claims, citing clear evidence and sound legal reasoning in the original verdict.The appeal was dismissed, and the six-month jail sentence was officially upheld by the Fujairah Court of Appeal. The case has garnered public attention for highlighting the intersection of digital privacy, superstition, and the misuse of technology in personal relationships.No further charges were reported against the spiritual healers involved, though their identities and phone numbers were part of the investigation. The court’s final decision underlined the UAE’s firm stance against sorcery, fraud, and cyber-enabled privacy violations.","A man in the UAE has been sentenced to six months in prison after being convicted of engaging in sorcery and violating the privacy of his estranged wife and her family.

The Iran-Israel conflict intensified on Wednesday as Israel launched a powerful wave of airstrikes, destroying key military infrastructure in and around Tehran including two centrifuge production facilities, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).The strikes mark a serious escalation in the six-day-old confrontation, with fears now mounting of an impending regional war.“The IDF attacked a centrifuge production site and several weapons production siteU.Ss of the Iranian regime last night,” Israel’s military said in a statement, adding that more than 50 fighter jets were involved in the mission. “More than 50 Air Force fighter jets, under precise intelligence guidance from the Intelligence Branch, have completed a series of attacks on military targets in the Tehran area in recent hours. ”The Israeli Defence Forces said the targeted centrifuge site was intended to accelerate Iran’s uranium enrichment capability for nuclear weapons. “The Iranian regime is enriching uranium intended for the development of nuclear weapons,” the IDF stated, noting that Iran's enrichment levels far surpass civilian energy requirements.The IAEA reported that the destroyed sites were not active enrichment plants but manufacturing hubs — critical to Iran’s capacity to build more centrifuges and expand nuclear operations.Centrifuges, delicate and high-speed spinning devices, are central to enriching uranium — either for peaceful energy or, at higher levels, for nuclear weapons. Damaging these manufacturing facilities could seriously hamper Iran's future ability to scale up enrichment.Other targeted sites included factories producing components for surface-to-surface and surface-to-air missiles, further underlining the breadth of Israel’s intent to dismantle Iran’s military-industrial complex.Despite the damage, Iran’s operational enrichment facilities remain partly functional. The Natanz Fuel Enrichment Plant, which had 13,500 centrifuges running out of 17,000 before the strike, has suffered significant power cuts. The Fordow site — located deep underground — remains largely intact and continues producing uranium enriched to 60%. According to the IAEA, Iran recently generated 166.6 kg of 60% enriched uranium — nearly enough for four nuclear bombs if refined further.While Iran has yet to disclose the full extent of Wednesday’s damage, residents in Tehran reported explosions that shook neighbourhoods and sent many fleeing in the dead of night. Human rights groups estimate that over 580 people have died in Iran since the conflict erupted, including civilians caught in the crossfire.US President Donald Trump, closely coordinating with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, sharply escalated tensions with a provocative statement on social media. “He is an easy target, but is safe there—we are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now,” Trump said, referring to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. He called for Iran’s “UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER” and dismissed its nuclear programme as anything but peaceful.Though the US has not yet entered the conflict militarily, it has repositioned assets in the region. Trump, who cut short his G7 summit visit to return to Washington, is under growing pressure from allies like Senator Lindsey Graham to deliver a decisive blow to Iran.Iran, meanwhile, remains defiant. “The punishment operation will be carried out soon,” said General Abdul Rahim Mousavi, the Iranian army chief, as another wave of missiles was launched toward Israel. Most were intercepted, but authorities in Israeli cities have kept air raid shelters open and continue urging citizens to remain on alert.The strikes mark one of the most serious escalations in years, not just between Iran and Israel, but for the wider region. Iran has warned that any direct US involvement could trigger an “all-out war.” As diplomacy falters and military action deepens, fears are growing that the next days could tip an already-volatile conflict into a far more dangerous phase.A centrifuge production site in a nuclear program is a specialised facility where the delicate and highly engineered components of gas centrifuges are designed, manufactured, assembled, and sometimes tested. These centrifuges are critical to uranium enrichment, a process essential for both civilian nuclear energy and, at high enrichment levels, for nuclear weapons.A gas centrifuge is a tall, cylindrical machine that spins uranium hexafluoride (UF₆) gas at very high speeds. Because uranium-235 (the fissile isotope used in nuclear reactors and bombs) is slightly lighter than uranium-238, the centrifugal force separates them — very gradually — allowing the concentration of U-235 to increase.Centrifuge production sites are the backbone of an enrichment programme. They:Destroying centrifuge production sites doesn’t immediately halt enrichment — but it cripples future expansion. Unlike enrichment facilities (like Natanz or Fordow), these production plants are where Iran (or any country) can build thousands of new centrifuges to scale up operations. Hitting these sites is seen as a long-term strategic setback for any clandestine or overt weapons programme.","Strikes hit deep into Iran’s nuclear infrastructure.

Poll Do you think Falguni Dey should have been informed about the special migration code before his journey? Yes, he should have been informed. No, it's his responsibility.

24x7 control room helpline numbers







NEW DELHI: Falguni Dey, a Kolkata-based geography professor and amateur mountaineer, thought the worst was over when he left the chaos of Tehran behind. After a harrowing 500-km road journey through a country rattled by missile strikes and fuel shortages, Dey reached the Astara border near the Caspian Sea, hoping to cross into Azerbaijan and board a flight from Baku to India.But what awaited him was another stretch of uncertainty -- marked by red tape, emotional exhaustion, and a prolonged wait for a migration code he never knew he needed.“I may have managed to escape the bombs in Tehran by undertaking this journey, but now I am stuck in Iran’s Astara land border because the Azerbaijan authorities would not accept me into their country without a special migration code issued by that government, and my e-visa won’t work,” Dey said in a voice message to PTI.The college professor had been stranded in Tehran since June 12, when Israel launched airstrikes on Iran as part of Operation Rising Lion, prompting the shutdown of airspace and halting his return journey. He had arrived in Iran on June 6 to attempt a summit of Mount Damavand but had to abandon his climb due to a snowstorm.By June 17, with no flights available and a growing sense of fear, he decided to escape by road, eventually reaching Astara.But the hope he carried with him was quickly replaced by despair.“Despite my best persuasions, I have been told that it would require at least another fortnight for that code to arrive, and I have no idea how I will survive that long in Iran,” he added, his voice cracking.With no access to Azerbaijan without the special code, Dey’s journey to safety -- and a pre-booked hotel room in Baku -- has been indefinitely delayed. The Mumbai-bound flight from Baku that he had booked is now cancelled, along with the hotel reservation made by his family in Kolkata.“No one told me in Tehran that my e-visa wasn’t sufficient to cross over to Azerbaijan by land and that I also need this special migration pass code, especially in a war situation like this,” Dey said. “I wasted no time in starting the application process... but the authorities have responded to me over email stating the process would require a minimum of 15 days.”As he watches other foreigners cross over with ease, Dey said Indians like him are being asked to wait for the migration code, making the situation even more isolating. “There’s a long queue of foreigners over here, and they are having all sorts of visas… But Indians like me have been told that possessing the migration code is mandatory for us to cross.”Though exhausted and facing a growing financial crunch, Dey remains thankful for the help he's received — both from his homeland and strangers along the way. “The vice chancellor of Calcutta University, Santa Dutta, is in constant touch with me. So is mountaineer Debasish Biswas. A senior officer from the Indian embassy’s cultural wing in Tehran, Balaram Shukla, is also helping me out.”Indian embassy officials in Tehran and Baku are reportedly working in coordination to convince Azerbaijan to allow Dey passage given the emergency situation.His 500-km drive from Tehran to Astara was filled with its own set of challenges. With fuel caps in place across Iran, the driver — a local woman from the travel agency had to stop frequently for fuel and basic needs. “They were kind and deeply human. They even brought me fruits and tea, and stayed at the terminal to ensure I was safe.”With no certainty of when the migration code will arrive, Dey is now considering a gruelling eight-hour journey to Armenia’s border, in the hope of finding a faster route out. But the emotional and physical toll is wearing him down.“I am physically and emotionally drained… The uncertainty of reaching home is killing me. All my efforts and the money spent by my family and friends to get me to safety seem to have come to nought,” he said.For now, Falguni Dey’s journey -- which began with the hope of scaling a peak -- has turned into a fight for survival, fuelled by the goodwill of strangers and the prayers of loved ones.Phone numbers to contact the control room - 1800118797 (toll-free), +91-11-23012113, +91-11-23014104, +91-11-23017905, +91-9968291988 (for WhatsApp) - e-mail ID (situationroom@mea.gov.in).","Falguni Dey, a Kolkata-based geography professor and amateur mountaineer, thought the worst was over when he left the chaos of Tehran behind.

UAE's Emergency Preparedness and Past Rescues

On June 4, the National Guard airlifted an injured crew member in his fifties from a Marshall Islands-flagged oil tanker in UAE waters, flying him to a local hospital for urgent treatment.





On May 18, 13 people were rescued from a sinking picnic boat, in an operation involving both citizens and residents.









In the early hours of Tuesday, June 17, two large vessels, oil tankerand cargo shipcollided approximately 24 nautical miles off the UAE’s eastern coast in the Gulf of Oman. The incident, which occurred at around 1:30 a.m., resulted in minor hull damage to both ships, a small oil spill, and a fire that broke out in the fuel tank of one of the vessels, according to the UAE’s Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure (MoEI).According to, thewas moving southbound at 13.1 knots when it executed a starboard (right) turn, colliding with the aft port side of the, which was moving southeast at 4.8 knots.The MoEI confirmed on Wednesday, June 18, that the accident was due to “navigational misjudgment by one of the vessels.” The fire was extinguished following prompt intervention by emergency teams, and no injuries were reported among the crew members of either ship.The two vessels involved are:The UAE National Guard confirmed that 24 crew members aboard the ADALYNN were evacuated by search and rescue boats and taken to the Port of Khor Fakkan. Personnel aboard thewere confirmed safe, and no pollution was reported on that vessel despite the fire on its deck.According to, the fire on thewas under control, and the incident is now under investigation, although the company emphasized that there was “no suggestion of outside interference.”A technical investigation is underway in cooperation with international maritime authorities. The MoEI assured that it would be conducted transparently and in accordance with the highest global maritime standards.The collision took place near the Strait of Hormuz, a narrow and strategic waterway that links the Gulf to the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea. This area is critical, as about 20% of the world’s seaborne oi, between 17.8 and 20.8 million barrels per day, according toflows through this route.This maritime zone has recently experienced electronic interference, amid escalating military tensions between Iran and Israel. Since Friday, both countries have exchanged missile fire, and according to maritime security firm, “the incident was not security-related.”Still, concerns remain. The Combined Maritime Force's JMIC information centre noted electronic signal interference in the region, particularly near Iran’s Bandar Abbas port. Although Tehran has not issued any comment on the collision or the reported electronic disruptions, its history of threatening to close the Strait of Hormuz in response to Western pressure has made the area increasingly volatile.As a result:“Rates, for the time being, remain stable with no noticeable increases since the latest hostilities between Israel and Iran,” said, head of marine at insurance broker. “This position could change dramatically depending on any further escalation or general conflagration in the area.”The recent rescue underscores the UAE’s strong maritime emergency response. Just weeks earlier:These coordinated efforts signal a robust and well-prepared emergency response capability from UAE authorities, especially as regional tensions continue to rise.","The Front Eagle, carrying 2 million barrels of crude oil to Zhoushan, China, collided at 13.1 knots with the Adalynn, which was heading empty toward the Suez Canal.

Exiled Iranian royal Reza Pahlavi, son of the last Shah of Iran, issued a dramatic call to action on Tuesday, urging Iran’s military, police, and state employees to join a nationwide uprising against the Khamenei-led Islamic Republic, declaring that its ""fall has begun. ""In a sweeping address to the Iranian people, Pahlavi wrote on X, ""The Islamic Republic has reached its end and is in the process of collapsing. Khamenei, like a frightened rat, has gone into hiding underground and has lost control of the situation. What has begun is irreversible.""He expressed solidarity with those affected by the country’s turmoil and reiterated his long-standing opposition to war. ""In these difficult days, my heart is with all the defenceless citizens who have been harmed and have fallen victim to Khamenei's warmongering and delusions.""Calling the current moment a “sharp turn in history,” Pahlavi asserted, ""The regime’s apparatus of repression is falling apart. All it takes now is a nationwide uprising to put an end to this nightmare once and for all.""Encouraging people across Iranian cities—from Bandar Abbas to Mashhad—to take to the streets, he sought to calm fears of chaos post-regime: ""Do not fear the day after the fall of the Islamic Republic.Iran will not descend into civil war or instability.""He said preparations were already in place: ""We have a plan for Iran’s future and its flourishing. We are prepared for the first hundred days after the fall, for the transitional period, and for the establishment of a national and democratic government—by the Iranian people and for the Iranian people.""To members of Iran’s state apparatus, Pahlavi appealed directly: ""Do not stand against the Iranian people for the sake of a regime whose fall has begun and is inevitable. By standing with the people, you can save your lives.""His call came a day after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu voiced strong support for regime change in Iran during an interview with the opposition-linked Iran International news outlet, saying, ""The regime’s days are numbered… I know that Iran can be great again. It was a great civilization, and this theological thuggery that has kidnapped your country will not stand for long, and you are the future, not them. ""Netanyahu added: ""A light has been lit—carry it to freedom. Your hour of freedom is near; it’s happening now.""Highlighting what he described as widespread dissent, Netanyahu said, ""These dictators in Iran, sure they fear us—but they fear you, the people of Iran, even more. They understand that 80 percent of Iranians despise them.""In a separate interview with Fox News, the Israeli leader indicated that ongoing pressure on Tehran could lead to a change in regime: ""Regime change could certainly be the result.""Citing ancient ties between the Iranian and Jewish people, Netanyahu said, ""The Persian people and the Jewish people have had an ancient friendship that goes back to the times of Cyrus the Great; that could happen again."" He emphasised, however, that the final decision rests with Iranians: ""The decision to act, to rise up, at this time is the decision of the Iranian people.""Israeli PM also confirmed that Israel’s recent strikes, dubbed ""Operation Rising Lion"", were launched based on intelligence that Tehran had stockpiled enough enriched uranium to build nine nuclear bombs.","Exiled Iranian royal Reza Pahlavi, son of the last Shah of Iran, issued a dramatic call to action on Tuesday.

Iran Releases Second Video Of Hypersonic Missile Attack On Israel; Fattah-1 Fired Towards Tel Aviv





Israel may be running dangerously low on its stock of Arrow missile interceptors, according to a report by the Wall Street Journal that cites a senior US official.The warning comes as Israel faces an unprecedented volume of ballistic missile attacks from Iran in the sixth day of full-blown conflict between the two countries.The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) has not confirmed any shortage and maintains that its air defence systems are successfully intercepting most incoming missiles. “The IDF is prepared and ready to handle any scenario. Unfortunately, we are unable to comment on matters related to munitions,” the military said in a statement.However, the American report suggests that the US has been aware of the problem for months and has quietly bolstered Israel’s defences with additional ground, sea, and air-based systems. The Pentagon has deployed assets including the Patriot and THAAD missile defence systems, while US Navy destroyers are assisting in intercept operations.Israel’s own Arrow system, developed by Israel Aerospace Industries, plays a critical role in intercepting long-range ballistic missiles.But with Iran firing hundreds of missiles in recent days, including the advanced Fatah-1 which Tehran says can escape current defence systems, pressure on Israel’s Arrow missile stock is growing.Iran’s Revolutionary Guards claim these missiles move at hypersonic speeds, making them harder to stop.Tom Karako, director of the Missile Defense Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that US and Israel cannot intercept missiles forever.“Neither the US nor the Israelis can continue to sit and intercept missiles all day. The Israelis and their friends need to move with all deliberate haste to do whatever needs to be done, because we cannot afford to sit and play catch,"" Karako said.Meanwhile, Israel has launched a new wave of attacks on Tehran in broad daylight, using over 50 fighter jets. The IDF said these strikes targeted a centrifuge production facility in Tehran used to enhance uranium enrichment and multiple other military production sites.In response, alerts for hostile aircraft were triggered multiple times on Wednesday morning in the Golan Heights. The IDF reported intercepting seven drones launched from Iran, preventing them from reaching Israeli territory.The escalating crisis has also affected civil aviation. Israeli airline El Al landed its first “Safe Return” evacuation flight from Cyprus at Ben Gurion Airport on Wednesday morning, amid tightened security protocols.Adding fuel to the fire, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei posted on social media: “Force must be used against the Zionist terrorist entity. We will not show leniency toward the Zionists.”US President Donald Trump has said it would be ""easy"" for the superpower to locate and eliminate Iran’s leader.

He is an easy target, but is safe there -- We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now,"" he wrote on his Truth Social platform.Warning Iran against targeting US interests, he also posted: ""But we don't want missiles shot at civilians, or American soldiers.Our patience is wearing thin.""And in a later post wrote: ""UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER!""The comments sent oil prices spiking more than four percent Tuesday on fears an escalation of the conflict could hammer supplies from the crude-rich region.But while both main contracts slipped Wednesday, investors remain on edge over any negative developments.Of particular concern is the possibility of Iran shutting off the Strait of Hormuz, through which around an estimated fifth of global oil supply traverses, according to a Commerzbank note.""Iran is reportedly ready to target US regional bases should Trump greenlight strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities,"" said Stephen Innes at SPI Asset Management.""Washington's refuelling jets are already en route, and if Fordow gets hit, expect the Strait of Hormuz to become a maritime minefield, Houthi drones to swarm Red Sea shipping lanes, and every militia from Basra to Damascus to light up American forward outposts.""Equity markets Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney, Mumbai, Wellington, Manila and Jakarta all sank, though Tokyo, Seoul, Taipei and Bangkok edged up.London edged up at the open even as data showed UK inflation slowed less than expected in May.Paris and Frankfurt also rose.The losses followed a weak day on Wall Street, where a below-forecast reading on US retail sales for May -- dragged by a slowdown in auto sales -- revived fresh worries about the world's top economy.

GAZA CITY: Gaza's civil defence agency said 30 people were killed by Israeli fire in the Palestinian territory on Wednesday, including 11 who were seeking aid.The war sparked by Hamas's October 2023 attack on Israel has ravaged the Gaza Strip, with severe shortages of food, fuel and clean water.Civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal told AFP that 11 people were killed and more than 100 wounded ""after the occupation forces opened fire and launched several shells... at thousands of citizens"" who had gathered to queue for food in central Gaza.In early March, Israel imposed a total aid blockade on Gaza amid deadlock in truce negotiations, only partially easing restrictions in late May.Since then, chaotic scenes and a string of deadly shootings have occurred near areas where Palestinians have gathered in hope of receiving aid.The civil defence agency said another 19 people were killed in three Israeli strikes on Wednesday, which it said targeted houses and a tent for displaced people.When asked for comment by AFP, the Israeli military said it was ""looking into"" the reports.Israeli restrictions on media in the Gaza Strip and difficulties in accessing some areas mean AFP is unable to independently verify the tolls and details provided by the civil defence agency.The UN humanitarian office OCHA said on Monday that its partners ""continue to warn of the risk of famine in Gaza, amid catastrophic levels of acute food insecurity"".The civil defence agency reported that at least 53 people were killed on Tuesday, as they gathered near an aid centre in the southern city of Khan Yunis hoping to receive flour.After Israel eased its blockade, the US- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) began distributing aid in late May, but its operations have been marred by chaotic scenes and dozens of deaths.In a statement on Tuesday, the organisation said that ""to date, not a single incident has occurred at or in the surrounding vicinity of GHF sites nor has an incident occurred during our operating hours"".UN agencies and major aid groups have refused to cooperate with the foundation over concerns it was designed to cater to Israeli military objectives.The Hamas attack which triggered the war resulted in the deaths of 1,219 people, according to Israeli official figures.The Gaza health ministry said on Tuesday that 5,194 people have been killed since Israel resumed major operations in the territory on March 18, ending a two-month truce.The overall death toll in Gaza since the war broke out has reached 55,493 people, according to the health ministry.","Civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal said 11 people were killed and more than 100 wounded.

'Will Skin Them Alive': Iranians Make Huge DECLARATION Against Israel Amid Threat To Khamenei





Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in series of posts on early Wednesday warned the ""terrorist Zionist regime"" and said “the battle begins” amid escalating tensions with Israel. Khamenei's post came following escalating threats from US President Donald Trump, who had just hours before called for Iran’s “unconditional surrender.""Moments later, Khamenei posted on X: “We must give a strong response to the terrorist Zionist regime. We will show the Zionists no mercy.” The statement came shortly after Iran launched two rounds of ballistic missiles at Israel early Wednesday.Khamenei’s posts appeared to frame the attacks as part of a broader ideological struggle. In Farsi, he posted “the battle begins”, alongside an image of a man with a sword entering a castle gate, alluding to the historic battle of Khaybar, as per the Times of Israel.In a series of posts on his platform Truth Social Trump had claimed the United States had full control of Iranian airspace and warned that the country’s top leader was within reach. “We know exactly where the so-called ‘Supreme Leader’ is hiding. He is an easy target, but is safe there - We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now,” Trump had wrote.“But we don’t want missiles shot at civilians, or American soldiers. Our patience is wearing thin. Thank you for your attention to this matter!” He later followed up with a post calling for Iran's “UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER!”Iran fired the latest barrage of missiles around 12.40 am which triggered sirens across of Israel and included around 15 projectiles. A second wave of about 10 rockets followed roughly 40 minutes later, prompting alerts in central parts of the country and the West Bank. Although there were no reported casualties, a fire broke out in a central Israeli parking lot, damaging several cars.Warning sirens were also activated around the Dead Sea due to what officials described as a suspected drone infiltration.Read: How Iran’s Supreme Commander Ayatollah Ali Khamenei lost his top commanders Meanwhile, Israel continued its offensive inside Iranian territory. Early Wednesday morning, the Israel defense forces (IDF) called for residents of Tehran’s District 18 to evacuate, citing upcoming military action targeting strategic infrastructure. Soon after, Israeli forces confirmed a new wave of airstrikes in Tehran. Reports also emerged of explosions in the city of Karaj, previously the site of a nuclear centrifuge facility targeted by Israeli strikes.Israel launched its military campaign six days ago, calling the assault necessary to dismantle what it described as an “existential threat” posed by Iran’s nuclear and missile programmes. According to Israeli officials, the ongoing operation aims to eliminate top Iranian military officials, nuclear scientists, missile launch sites and uranium enrichment centres.The conflict has already caused significant casualties. Iranian authorities report at least 224 people killed in Israeli strikes, while Israel says over 370 missiles and hundreds of drones have been launched by Iran.

In a significant humanitarian gesture, the United Arab Emirates has waived all overstay fines for Iranian nationals, including both residents and visitors, regardless of the visa category under which they entered the country. The announcement was made on Tuesday, June 17, by the Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Port Security (ICP).The authority clarified that this decision was made “in response to the exceptional circumstances that the region is witnessing and to provide relief to this group of people who were unable to return to their homeland, due to the closure of airspace and the suspension of flights.”This move follows days of escalating conflict in the Middle East. Since Friday, Israel and Iran have been engaged in a direct air conflict, with Israel launching attacks on nuclear and military sites within Iran. In response, Iran has fired missiles into Israeli territory. As of Tuesday, the conflict has entered its fifth day, severely disrupting commercial air traffic and stranding travelers across the region.The exemption for Iranian nationals was issued under the directives of UAE President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan.The ICP said that the directive aims to provide immediate support to Iranian citizens affected by the conflict-induced travel disruptions.The decision applies to all Iranians present in the UAE, regardless of their visa type or duration of stay. It is part of a broader strategy by the UAE to respond swiftly to international humanitarian needs caused by conflict or crisis.To avail of the waiver, Iranian nationals are encouraged to register through the UAE's smart services platform or visit ICP customer happiness centres located across the country. The exemption is not automatic and requires eligible individuals to complete the registration process.The ICP confirmed that the exemption will remain in effect until December 31, 2025. This generous timeframe offers relief and flexibility for Iranian nationals unable to return home due to airspace closures and geopolitical instability.This is not the first time the UAE has taken such measures in response to conflict. Just last month, Sudanese nationals in the UAE were also granted full exemption from fines related to both residence and entry permits. That policy took effect on May 19, 2025, and was similarly aimed at easing the humanitarian burden caused by the crisis in Sudan.The ICP emphasized that both the Iranian and Sudanese exemptions reflect the UAE's ongoing commitment to supporting affected communities and align with its national efforts to strengthen social and humanitarian well-being among residents.","The United Arab Emirates has waived all overstay fines for Iranian nationals.

Gulf waters under watch: Qatar warns of potential regional impact



Nuclear and energy sites struck as conflict enters fifth day



Qatar condemns strikes on energy infrastructure







Amid heightened conflict between Israel and Iran, Qatar has stepped up monitoring of radiation levels in the Gulf, following Israeli airstrikes on Iranian nuclear and energy sites. On Tuesday, Qatari foreign ministry spokesman Majed al-Ansari confirmed that Doha is closely tracking environmental developments in the region, while calling for international awareness of the potential fallout from strikes on sensitive facilities.“We are monitoring this on a daily basis,” al-Ansari said during a news conference.“We have nothing to be concerned about right now, but obviously prolonged escalation will have unpredictable consequences.”Al-Ansari stressed the strategic and environmental importance of the Gulf’s waters, describing them as the region’s primary water source. He warned that any military action targeting nuclear or energy-related facilities could result in outcomes beyond current prediction.“We have to emphasise, when we are talking about the waters of the Gulf, it’s the main source of water for all of us here in the region,” he said.“The international community has to make it very clear that any targeting of nuclear facilities, any targeting of fuel or energy facilities in this region, would have ramifications that are unknown to us in the Gulf.”The current escalation began Friday when Israel launched a major air campaign against Iran’s nuclear infrastructure. This marked the start of a now five-day-long exchange of missile strikes between the two countries.Iran’s key nuclear enrichment facilities, which were among the Israeli targets, are located deep inland. However, Iran also operates a nuclear power plant at Bushehr, situated along the Gulf coast.According to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Iran informed the UN nuclear watchdog that the Bushehr plant had not been targeted. The statement was issued by the IAEA on Friday.On Saturday, Israel targeted a significant Iranian gas installation on the Gulf coast. The facility supports the South Pars gas field, a major energy project shared between Iran and Qatar.While confirming that Qatar’s part of the shared gas field remains unaffected, the Qatari government expressed concern over the risks such attacks pose to regional stability.“Qatar's own facilities in the field are secure,” said al-Ansari.Nonetheless, he strongly criticised the Israeli strikes on Iran’s energy assets.He described the actions as “reckless,” adding to Qatar’s calls for de-escalation and urging international stakeholders to prevent further destabilisation in the Gulf.","Qatar has stepped up monitoring of radiation levels in the Gulf, following Israeli airstrikes on Iranian nuclear and energy sites.

Grief Meets Generosity: A Community Stands Up

‘Support Group to Help’





In the quiet hours after disaster, the first residents of the 67-storey Marina Pinnacle Tower, also known as Tiger Tower, have been allowed back into the building to retrieve what little may be left. The high-rise in Dubai Marina was partially gutted by a fire on Friday night. Days later, the reality of what was lost is beginning to sink in.For many, it’s not just belongings, but entire lives turned to soot. Charred walls, soot-covered furniture, and gutted rooms greeted them, turning tearful reunions with their homes into moments of anguish.Salma Sherif Elhouseny, an Egyptian business consultant, had only been in Dubai for a year and a half. Her apartment on the 40th floor had been her safe space in a new country. She returned to it escorted by a Dubai Police officer, stepping carefully over blackened rubble. A video she later shared shows her sobbing uncontrollably as she is led through the ruins by a Dubai Police officer.“My master bedroom… it’s completely gone. I'm devastated, everything's lost. My jewellery, my laptop, my clothes, birth and education certificates, all the money I had, it was all here,” she told, her voice still trembling.“I know others have lost more, but I am alone in this city. This was everything I had.”She had waited several hours just to be allowed in, eventually escorted up through a cargo elevator shortly before midnight.“I was just lucky they let me in,” she said.Authorities have implemented strict controls to manage the entry of displaced tenants. Dubai Police and Civil Defence now require residents to register their names, present Emirates ID and tenancy (Ejari) documents, and wait for their turn. Entry is granted to small escorted groups, each allowed only around 10 minutes inside.Passports, medications, laptops, car keys, these are the urgent items people are prioritising as they step into their damaged homes.“There’s a system in place, and they are trying their best,” one tenant told, acknowledging the structure amid the chaos.But the process hasn’t been smooth for everyone.“Some people are misusing the opportunity by carrying heavy suitcases and staying longer than allowed. It slows everything down and delays those still waiting,” said another resident.Some floors, particularly the lower ones, appear to have escaped major damage. An Indian homeowner who visited his third-floor apartment said he felt fortunate.“Some smoke damage, but nothing serious. I consider myself lucky, given what others are going through.”For many others, especially those living on higher floors, access is still out of reach.Yasemin Fuentes, a Turkish expat who lived on the 47th floor with her husband, daughter, and three pets, has made multiple attempts to retrieve essentials, all unsuccessful.“More than 200 people were waiting, and it was too hot. I was told only those with medical needs or flights were being allowed in briefly,” she said. “We’re still wearing the clothes we fled in. I haven’t been able to get my ID or second phone.”The night of the fire, Yasemin hadn’t even been aware of the danger until a friend from a neighbouring tower called her around 10pm.“There was no alarm. I grabbed my daughter, our two cats, and the dog. By the time we got to the stairwell, it was filled with smoke. That’s when panic really kicked in.”Others, now allowed in, are documenting and sharing their losses through WhatsApp support groups.For residents living in shared accommodations, the experience has been even more constrained.“You’re only allowed into your own room. Police were very strict about that,” said one tenant.“And if you're above the 40th floor, there’s no electricity at all. We were given enough time to collect essentials, though.”Even as residents cope with trauma and uncertainty, community solidarity has begun to fill the gaps left behind by the fire.A WhatsApp group namedhas grown to over 1,000 members. It now functions as a central hub for aid, offering everything from temporary accommodation and clothing to food supplies. Volunteers continue to show up, helping neighbours with what they can.Mental health professionals have stepped in too, offering free counselling to those impacted. Daily virtual sessions featuring laughter therapy and traditional yoga are being held every morning from 6:45am to 7:45am until Friday, providing some emotional relief for those still processing what happened.There are no easy recoveries from events like this, but in the ruins of Marina Pinnacle, the compassion of a city is beginning to rebuild what flames took away.","First residents of Dubai's Tiger Tower have been allowed back into the building to retrieve what little may be left.

US Vice-President JD Vance on Tuesday warned that Donald Trump might take ""further action"" in a bid to end Iran's nuclear programme hours after the US president strongly advocated against Tehran possessing any nuclear weapon.""The president has shown remarkable restraint in keeping our military's focus on protecting our troops and protecting our citizens. He may decide he needs to take further action to end Iranian enrichment,"" Vance said in a post X.Clearing the air over US's stance regarding Iran possessing nukes, Vance said, ""First, POTUS has been amazingly consistent, over 10 years, that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. Over the last few months, he encouraged his foreign policy team to reach a deal with the Iranians to accomplish this goal. The president has made clear that Iran cannot have uranium enrichment. And he said repeatedly that this would happen one of two ways--the easy way or the 'other' way. """"Second, I've seen a lot of confusion over the issue of ""civilian nuclear power"" and ""uranium enrichment."" These are distinct issues. Iran could have civilian nuclear power without enrichment, but Iran rejected that. Meanwhile, they've enriched uranium far above the level necessary for any civilian purpose.They've been found in violation of their non-proliferation obligations by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which is hardly a rightwing organization,"" he added.Earlier in the day, Trump had made it clear that Iran ""cannot have nuclear weapons"" saying, ""Iran should have signed the “deal” I told them to sign. What a shame, and waste of human life. Simply stated, IRAN CAN NOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON. I said it over and over again! Everyone should immediately evacuate Tehran!""Israel's recent military operation targeted Iran’s key nuclear facilities at Natanz, Fordow, and Isfahan, according to the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). A major above-ground section of Natanz, including its power infrastructure, was destroyed, and satellite imagery suggests potential damage to its underground enrichment plant.While no visible damage was found at the deeply buried Fordow enrichment site, the IAEA confirmed that four buildings at the Isfahan facility were hit — including a chemical lab, uranium conversion plant, reactor fuel plant, and a metal processing unit under construction.","US Vice-President JD Vance warned that Donald Trump might take ""further action"" in a bid to end Iran's nuclear programme.

A Sharjah court has convicted two school staff members of negligence in the death of eight-year-old Indian student Rashid Habib, more than a year after he tragically died following a fall at his school in Muwaileh.The Sharjah Federal Court of Appeal overturned an earlier acquittal by a lower court and ordered the defendants to pay Dh200,000 in legal blood money to the boy’s family. Additionally, each staff member was fined Dh2,000.The court found that the two staffers had failed in their duty to escort and monitor students from the school bus to their classrooms. CCTV footage reviewed during the investigation showed that Rashid was left unaccompanied at the time of the incident.The Grade 1 student collapsed while walking alone to his classroom on 11 March 2024, the first day of Ramadan, shortly after arriving at the CBSE-curriculum school.He was rushed to Al Qassimi Hospital in a state of cardiac arrest but was declared dead despite resuscitation attempts.A forensic report from Sharjah Police stated that Rashid had sustained a bruise on his face, a fractured cheekbone, internal bleeding under the scalp, and severe brain injuries, including swelling and bleeding.Surveillance footage confirmed that no school staff were present with the children during the incident. The footage also showed that another child had attempted to hit Rashid moments before he fell. However, the crucial seconds capturing the exact moment of the fall were missing.The appeal court ruled that the staff’s absence amounted to gross negligence, emphasising that the accident could likely have been prevented had the staff been present.Rashid’s father, Habib Yasar, told Khaleej Times: “Not a day goes by when we don’t remember Rashid. Our lives have never been the same. We keep thinking of what could have been if someone had just been there to watch over him. Why was there no CCTV camera? A school is supposed to be like a second home, but it didn’t take care of my child. This conviction brings some closure, but the pain remains. We lost a part of ourselves that day. ”The family had previously claimed Rashid was bullied and attacked during the missing seconds, a charge the school denied.Due to ongoing legal and administrative proceedings, the name of the school involved is being withheld.",Rashid Habib collapsed while walking alone to his classroom on 11 March 2024.

UAE legalizes tobacco-free nicotine pouches to help smokers quit cigarettes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-legalizes-tobacco-free-nicotine-pouches-to-help-smokers-quit-cigarettes/articleshow/121910813.cms,"Nicotine pouches offer a smoke-free alternative by delivering nicotine through the mouth, lowering lung damage risks compared to cigarettes./ (File)

Khaleej Times





The UAE will officially allow the sale of tobacco-free nicotine pouches starting July 29, following the enactment of a new Cabinet resolution that sets technical standards for this emerging smoking alternative. The new law aims to provide smokers with additional tools to quit cigarettes.Dr Sanam Mallick, Consultant in Family Medicine at Burjeel Hospital Abu Dhabi, described nicotine pouches as small, smokeless products that contain nicotine but no tobacco. “People place them between their gum and lips to absorb nicotine without smoking or chewing tobacco. They’re popular as a discreet alternative to cigarettes or chewing tobacco. Nicotine pouches contain nicotine, the same chemical that we find in tobacco,” he toldNicotine, the addictive substance in tobacco, is released by these pouches and stimulates dopamine production, the ‘feel-good hormone.’ This process helps reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms, thereby assisting smokers in quitting.“Nicotine pouches can be a valuable tool for some people trying to quit smoking, but whether they’re a good option compared to other smoking cessation methods depends on a few factors,” Dr Mallick explained.One major benefit of nicotine pouches is the absence of smoke inhalation, which significantly reduces the risk of lung damage associated with traditional cigarettes. However, Dr Mallick cautioned that, like all nicotine products, pouches can be addictive. “They still contain nicotine, so they don’t remove the addiction, just the smoking behaviour. (Additionally), because they’re relatively new, the long-term health impacts are still being studied. ”Regarding effectiveness, Dr Mallick noted that some smokers have successfully used pouches to gradually reduce or replace cigarette smoking, while others find it challenging due to the continued oral habit. “Others may find the oral fixation or habit harder to break, since pouches still involve placing something in the mouth (similar to chewing tobacco).”Nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs) such as patches, gum, and lozenges are well-established methods known to increase quit rates by 50 to 70 per cent. “Nicotine pouches might offer similar benefits, but without long-term studies, their effectiveness compared to these therapies is less certain,” Dr Mallick added.Shiraz Khan, Chief Operating Officer at Aster Retail GCC, further explained the difference between nicotine pouches and patches. “Nicotine from pouches is absorbed through the lining of the mouth. In contrast, nicotine patches are transdermal products applied to the skin. They slowly release nicotine into the bloodstream over a period of time, helping to reduce withdrawal symptoms and cravings,” he said. “The key difference lies in the method of delivery. Pouches work via oral mucosal absorption, while patches deliver nicotine through the skin.”Currently, NRTs such as patches, gum, and lozenges are widely available in UAE pharmacies, often sold over the counter without prescription. However, some higher-dose patches or combination therapies might require healthcare provider supervision, Khan noted.NRTs are popular among smokers aiming to quit due to their discreet usage, absence of smoke, and perceived lower harm compared to traditional tobacco products. “Products like nicotine gums and lozenges have seen rapid growth due to their discreet use, lack of smoke, and perceived lower harm compared to traditional tobacco products,” Khan said.Under UAE regulations, all nicotine products must carry health warnings and age restriction labels, with sales prohibited to anyone under 18 years. Packaging and labelling are required to comply with UAE-specific guidelines, including Arabic labelling. “Only licensed retailers or pharmacies may sell these products,” Khan added.Globally, tobacco remains the leading preventable cause of disease and premature death. According to a guide released last year by the UAE Ministry of Health and Prevention (Mohap), the global tobacco epidemic claims nearly eight million lives annually, ranking it as one of the world’s most serious public health threats.In the UAE, the National Health Survey of 2018 found that nearly 16 per cent of men and 2.5 per cent of women are smokers.To bolster tobacco cessation efforts, UAE authorities have committed to providing counselling and psychological support to individuals seeking to quit all forms of tobacco, including e-cigarettes.",The UAE will allow the sale of tobacco-free nicotine pouches starting July 29.

'Mehul Choksi's Extradition To India Will Be Tough' Says Former CBI Director

LONDON: Fugitive diamond merchant Mehul Choksi is suing the Indian govt and five other people in the London high court for orchestrating what he refers to as his “kidnapping” from Antigua in 2021 in an alleged honeytrap plot.Choksi has claimed in the preliminary hearing that five people working for R&AW kidnapped him in Antigua and smuggled him on a yacht to Dominica in a plot masterminded by the Indian state in order to extradite him to India to face charges in the Rs 13,500 Punjab National Bank scam.Antigua police named Gurdip Bath, Barbara Jarabik, Gurmit Singh, Gurjit Singh Bhandal and Leslie Farrow-Guy as the five suspects, mostly UK-based, in the kidnapping. They are all being sued by Choksi alongside the Indian govt. They all deny the charges.The court documents were served on the ministry of external affairs by the British high commission in New Delhi.Edward Fitzgerald KC, representing Choksi (66), told Justice Freedman on Monday that Choksi was filing a civil suit against the Indian govt for allegedly ordering Choksi to be kidnapped on May 21, 2021 and smuggled by yacht to Dominica.India denies any involvement, argues it is protected by state immunity and that the UK courts do not have jurisdiction for this case.Harish Salve KC, representing India’s govt, said: “There is no evidence of India having anything to do with the alleged events. The claimant’s account is rife with non sequiturs and unsupported assumptions. Those accused seem a rather unlikely band of state-sponsored conspirators.”Choksi is currently in jail in Belgium where he is fighting extradition proceedings brought by India.Choksi first met Barbara Jarabik, a Hungarian luxury goods expert, in Antigua in Aug 2020.

Who is Blasie Metreweli?

Poll Do you believe that having a woman lead MI6 will bring a positive change to the agency? Yes, it's time for diversity in leadership. No, it should be based on merit alone.

Why UK decided to change MI6 leadership now?





UK's foreign intelligence service MI6 to be led by its first woman intelligence officer, Blaise Metreweli.UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Sunday announced the appointment of Blaise Metreweli as the 18th head of MI6, also known as the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS). She is set to assume the role in the autumn this year, succeeding Richard Moore, who has been holding this position for five years.A Cambridge University alumna, Metreweli,49 has had a distinguished career in intelligence services since 1999, when she first joined SIS. Metrerweli currently heads MI6's technology and innovation efforts, a role that mirrors the fictional 'M' character from the James Bond franchise, famously portrayed by Judi Dench.She has previously held senior positions in both MI6 and MI5, the UK’s domestic intelligence service. Her work has focused on assignments in the Middle East and Europe, according to the official statement.Blaise Metreweli expresses her gratitude regarding her appointment as the head of MI6. ""It is both a privilege and an honor to be chosen to lead my Service.""While MI5 first appointed a female chief more than three decades ago — Stella Rimington in 1992, MI6 had not had a woman at its head until now.GCHQ, another arm of the UK’s intelligence services, named its first female director, Anne Keast-Butler, in 2023.“The historic appointment of Blaise Metreweli comes at a time when the work of our intelligence services has never been more vital,” Starmer said in a statement released by Downing Street. “The United Kingdom is facing threats on an unprecedented scale — be it aggressors who send their spy ships to our waters or hackers whose sophisticated cyber plots seek to disrupt our public services.”","UK's foreign intelligence service MI6 to be led by its first woman intelligence officer, Blaise Metreweli.

Why a Statutory Inquiry Matters

Demand the release of classified documents and internal reports;

Take testimony from survivors in private or public;

Recommend structural reforms for law enforcement, social services, and public communication.

For many survivors, this is the first time they feel their voices might lead to actual accountability.

What Happens Next



Musk’s involvement, while controversial, showed how digital platforms can force action on long-ignored issues.

Starmer’s government is now under pressure to implement swift reforms and offer compensation to survivors.

The political debate has sharpened, with opposition parties vowing to make grooming gangs a central issue in the next election.

Final Word







After years of public outcry, multiple local reviews, and political hesitation, the UK government has announced a full national statutory inquiry into grooming gangs and institutional failures that enabled decades of child sexual exploitation.The decision, announced by Prime Minister Keir Starmer on June 14, marks a dramatic shift in tone for his administration—one that had previously resisted demands for a public investigation into what many see as one of Britain’s worst safeguarding scandals.The tipping point? A perfect storm of political pressure, survivor testimony, community backlash—and unusually, a global spotlight powered by Elon Musk , who used his platform, X (formerly Twitter), to repeatedly target Starmer’s record on grooming gangs.The term “grooming gangs” refers to loosely organised groups of men who exploited underage girls—typically white, working-class, and often in care—in towns across northern England from the early 1990s onwards.The 2014 Jay Report on Rotherham, commissioned after investigative journalism exposed widespread abuse, identified over 1,400 victims between 1997 and 2013. Similar patterns were later uncovered in Rochdale, Telford, Oxford, and Oldham.What made the cases especially sensitive was the ethnic background of many offenders—in several high-profile cases, the perpetrators were men of Pakistani Muslim heritage. However, the official framing used the broader term “Asian grooming gangs”—a euphemism that triggered resentment among British Indians, Sikhs, and East Asians who said their communities were being unfairly implicated.British-Indian communities, especially Hindus and Sikhs, have long objected to the blanket use of the term “Asian grooming gangs.” Their frustration boiled over in January this year when Starmer, in response to criticism from Elon Musk, once again used the phrase during a televised interview.Community leaders issued sharp statements denouncing what they called an ethnic smear. “Why should we be classified as part of these gangs?” asked Jay Shah, spokesperson for Friends of India Society International UK. “Asian means Vietnamese, Sri Lankan, Japanese, Indian, etc. When it comes to grooming gangs, we are Asian. When it comes to Kashmir, we are Indian.”The Hindu Council UK called Starmer’s wording a “whitewash of heinous atrocities,” noting that Hindu and Sikh girls had also been among the victims. Sikh Youth UK, which has documented grooming cases involving Sikh victims for over 15 years, said it had worked with thousands of families and even caught perpetrators outside Sikh schools. The Network of Sikh Organisations described Starmer’s comments as “extremely disappointing” and accused politicians of “protecting perpetrators rather than victims.”Both the Hindu Council UK and INSIGHT UK have since backed Conservative calls for a national inquiry—arguing that political correctness has too often silenced honest debate about ethnicity and crime.The turning point came not from Westminster but from Silicon Valley.In early 2025, Elon Musk—whose X platform has grown into a global political amplifier—began posting repeatedly about grooming gangs. Quoting survivor testimonies, reposting historical reporting, and tagging British officials, Musk accused UK authorities of “turning a blind eye to organised rape” and suggested that political leaders, including Starmer, were “cowards unwilling to confront the truth.”One post from March read: “If these were elite London girls being trafficked, the BBC would talk about nothing else. But poor northern girls? The state looked away.”While the tone of Musk’s commentary sparked debate—especially among British politicians who viewed it as inflammatory—it undeniably brought renewed international attention to the issue.By May, Musk’s X account had posted or amplified over 150 messages about grooming gangs, triggering renewed media coverage, a spike in search interest, and thousands of public responses. Hashtags such as #JusticeForRotherham, #GroomingGangsInquiry, and #StarmerFailedUs trended across the UK and US.The growing visibility added fuel to a debate already brewing in Parliament.In January, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper had quietly commissioned Baroness Louise Casey to conduct a “rapid review” into previous investigations—including Oldham and Rochdale—after persistent claims that public officials downplayed or ignored evidence of abuse.Casey’s report, delivered in May, was damning. It found that multiple public bodies “failed in their duty of care” and that in some cases, victims were dismissed or even blamed. Crucially, it called for a full statutory public inquiry with the ability to compel testimony and evidence.Simultaneously, Conservative MPs, Reform UK leaders, and victim advocacy groups demanded action. Former Home Secretary Suella Braverman, a long-time critic of the “Asian gangs” terminology, stated that Starmer had “run out of excuses.” Reform UK leader Nigel Farage called the lack of a national inquiry “a betrayal of Britain’s daughters.”On June 14, Keir Starmer announced the establishment of a judge-led inquiry under the 2005 Inquiries Act, which gives it full legal powers. He said the investigation would “examine past failures, hold institutions to account, and ensure this can never happen again.”Starmer, who previously served as Director of Public Prosecutions, defended his record, pointing to a rise in grooming-related prosecutions during his tenure. But critics argue that his earlier reluctance to endorse a national inquiry allowed the issue to fester—and exposed Labour to accusations of institutional denial.“There is no more denying the scale of failure,” Starmer said at a press conference. “This inquiry is about justice—for survivors, for their families, and for the country.”Unlike previous reviews—many of which lacked transparency and enforcement—this inquiry has legal teeth. It can:The inquiry will take several months to set up, with hearings likely to begin in early 2026. Its findings could reshape the way Britain handles child protection, race relations, and public accountability. But in the short term, it’s already had an impact:This is not just a story of abuse—it’s a story of institutional failure, political caution, and the new ways power is exercised across borders and platforms. Whether the inquiry delivers justice remains to be seen. But for the thousands of girls whose pain was ignored—and for the communities wrongly smeared along the way—this is a reckoning long overdue.","After years of public outcry, multiple local reviews, and political hesitation, the UK government has announced a full national statutory inquiry into grooming gangs.

The relationship between King Charles and Prince Harry has reportedly deteriorated beyond repair, leaving little hope for a royal reconciliation.The 76-year-old monarch has maintained a reserved stance whilst being physically separated by 5,459 miles from his younger son, following Harry and Meghan Markle 's withdrawal from royal duties in 2020.The father-son relationship has deteriorated to such an extent that palace sources believe reconciliation is now improbable between the royal family members, according to the New York Post.""There is no turning back,"" royal expert Hilary Fordwich told Fox News.

: An oil portrait believed to be the only painting Mahatma Gandhi ever sat for is going under the hammer at Bonhams in July with an estimate of £50,000-£70,000 (Rs 58 lakh to Rs 81 lakh. )It is the first time this portrait has ever been sold at auction as it remained in British artist Clare Leighton’s collection until her death in 1989, after which it was passed down through her family.Leighton, reputed for her wooden engravings, was introduced to Gandhi when he visited London in 1931 to attend the Second Round Table Conference.At the time, she was in a relationship with political journalist Henry Noel Brailsford, who was a passionate supporter of Indian Independence. He had travelled to India in 1930 where he met key Independence figures. Afterwards he published the book “Rebel India”, met Gandhi in London in 1931 and introduced Leighton to him. She became one of very few artists admitted to his office and was given the opportunity to sit with him to sketch and paint him in 1931.In Nov 1931 Leighton showcased her portraits at the Albany Galleries in London.The following month, Gandhi's personal secretary, Mahadev Desai, wrote a letter to Leighton, a copy of which is attached to the backing board, which reads: “It was such a pleasure to have had you here for many mornings doing Mr Gandhi’s portrait.”According to the artist’s family, the portrait was on public display in 1974 when it was allegedly attacked with a knife by a Hindu right-wing activist. The catalogue entry states: “We have found no documentation to corroborate this, but the painting shows signs of restoration to what appears to be repaired tears in several places. A label attached to the backing board confirms the painting was restored in 1974 by the Lyman Allyn Museum Conservation Laboratory. ”“There is nothing comparable to this painting in existence as it was painted in his lifetime and was a painting that he sat for on multiple occasions,” Rhyanon Demery, head of sale, told TOI.The auction takes place from 7 to 15 July.","Oil portrait believed to be the only painting Mahatma Gandhi ever sat for is going under the hammer at Bonhams in July with an estimate of £50,000-£70,000.

TOI correspondent from London: Indigenous communities across India are being pushed out of their ancestral lands in the name of tourism and expansion of tiger projects whilst the laws to protect them are being diluted and not implemented properly, Adivasis told a global press briefing on Monday.“They say India has got freedom. But I think Adivasi people have not yet got freedom,” J C Shivamma, from the Jenu Kuruba tribe, said at the online event organised by Community Network Against Protected Areas.She is among the 52 households who reoccupied their ancestral land within Nagarhole tiger reserve on May 5, 35 years after their families were forcibly evicted.“Some of our family members died when in the plantations, but our sacred deities, our graveyard, everything that concerns us, is still in the village, so we used to go back to bury our people in our ancestral land, but it was always a fight with the forest department toconduct rituals. We consider our ancestors to be on the lands, they become deities and this way we were tortured. If we have to die, we will die on our ancestral land,” she said.Shivu JA recalled how their houses were burnt and elephants brought to destroy their fields when they were evicted from Karadikallu. “This land is ours. It's not any tiger project or scheme of the govt for tiger conservation,” he said.“Our elders are very happy now.We are having our food, we are going for honey collection. We have our own water resource. We sit together in the evening, and they are teaching us songs. All these songs and lessons were silenced for 40 years.""“The forest department keeps saying that only after your rights are recognised, you can live on this land. We already have these rights,” he said.The Jenu Kurubas are filing a case against the Forest Department under the SC/ST Atrocities Act for withholding their rights and filing an appeal against 39 rejected forest rights claims.“Why are their rights not being recognised despite the notification of central legislation such as the Forest Rights Act 2006,” asked scholar Nitin Rai.“People across the country in different states are fighting the same battles. It is important to find a way to raise a collective voice for what is happening all over,” said lawyer Lara Jesani.","Indigenous communities across India are being pushed out of their ancestral lands in the name of tourism and expansion of tiger projects. 52 households reoccupied their ancestral land within Nagarhole tiger reserve on May 5, 35 years after their families were forcibly evicted.

Summer drought risk







LONDON: The UK experienced its warmest spring on record, and its driest in more than 50 years, the country's official weather service said on Monday.Temperatures for the season have been frequently elevated this century, according to the data from the Met Office, which said: ""Eight of the 10 warmest UK springs have occurred since the year 2000. ""The data ""clearly shows that recent decades have been warmer, sunnier, and often drier than the 20th century average,"" said Met Office scientist Emily Carlisle.The Met Office said provisional temperatures registered between March and May this year averaged 9.51 degrees Celsius (49.1 degrees Fahrenheit).That beat the last record, set in last year's spring, when the average was 9.37 degrees.The next warmest springs were in 2011, 2014 and 2007, according to the Met Office which has been recording temperature data since 1884.This year, the 128.2 millimetres (five inches) of rainfall recorded across the UK during the season was ""approximately 40 percent below the long-term average and still the driest spring in more than 50 years"", it said.""England was particularly dry, experiencing its driest spring in more than 100 years, beaten only by 1893,"" it added.The Met Office's Carlisle said: ""The UK's climate continues to change. What's particularly notable about spring 2025 is the combination of record warmth and sunshine, alongside very low rainfall.""""This spring shows some of the changes we're seeing in our weather patterns, with more extreme conditions, including prolonged dry, sunny weather, becoming more frequent,"" she said.The recent weather's dominant feature had been the persistent high-pressure systems, often coming from the Azores or mainland Europe.These had lingered over the UK since late February and blocked the usual flow of Atlantic weather fronts, allowing high pressure to dominate, the Met Office said.Last month, the Environment Agency (EA) called a meeting of its national drought group after it said levels in reservoirs were ""exceptionally low"".In the meeting, the EA's deputy water director, Richard Thompson warned that ""changing climate means we will see more summer droughts in the coming decades"".The agency added that, while there was no official drought yet, there was a ""medium risk"" of a summer drought without sustained rainfall.The UK government has said it would step in to fast-track the building of two new reservoirs.According to the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs, no new water reservoirs have been built since 1992.Scientists warn that extreme and fluctuating weather events are becoming increasingly common as planet-heating fossil fuel emissions keep rising.","The UK experienced its warmest spring on record, and its driest in more than 50 years.

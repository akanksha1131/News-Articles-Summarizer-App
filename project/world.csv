Brazil President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva was discharged from Sao Paulo hospital on Sunday after undergoing emergency brain surgery . The 79-year-old had surgery on Tuesday to relieve pressure caused by a head injury he sustained in October.The surgeons drilled through his skull to alleviate pressure that had accumulated following a head injury from a bathroom fall at his presidential residence in Brasilia in October. He had a second procedure on Thursday to reduce the risk of further bleeding.Doctors said Lula is recovering well and can return to work with limited physical activity.

Lula will stay in Sao Paulo for follow-up tests until Thursday before returning to Brasilia.Speaking at a news conference, Lula said, “I am here in one piece... returning home calmly.” He later waved to reporters as he left the hospital. He further described experiencing symptoms before the surgery, stating, “I felt like my steps were slowing down, my eyes were red and I was very sleepy.” He also expressed his apprehension, saying, “I confess I was scared by the volume of fluid growth in my head. I was worried by the urgency of the request” to go to the hospital. He further admitted, “I never think I'm going to die, but I'm scared, so I need to follow the rules.” Looking ahead, Lula confirmed, “I'm going home now, calm, sure that I'm cured and that I just need to take care of myself.”The president initially injured his head in a fall at his residence in October.

Michael Moore vows to 'pour gasoline' on public anger after Mangione's murder of CEO: 'Not often my work gets a killer’s 5-star rating',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/michael-moore-vows-to-pour-gasoline-on-public-anger-after-mangiones-murder-of-ceo-not-often-my-work-gets-a-killers-5-star-rating/articleshow/116350509.cms,"Michael Moore vows to ""pour gasoline"" on public anger against insurance companies after UnitedHealthcare CEO killing

Award-winning director Michael Moore , renowned for his critical documentaries on the American healthcare system, has reacted to the shocking murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson by accused killer Luigi Mangione . The killing, which occurred outside a Manhattan hotel, has ignited a wave of public outrage, and Mangione allegedly referenced Moore's 2007 film SICKO in a manifesto praising the director's exposure of the US healthcare system.In a post on his Substack Friday, Moore responded to Mangione’s alleged remarks, quipping, “It’s not often that my work gets a killer five-star review from an actual killer.”The director, who has been vocal about the flaws of the healthcare industry for years, acknowledged the wide-reaching impact of SICKO, stating that millions, including Mangione, have seen the film.Moore then delved into a more serious discussion in the post titled “A Manifesto Against For-Profit Health Insurance Companies,” where he condemned the murder while simultaneously lambasting the health insurance industry that he believes is responsible for widespread suffering in America. “Yes, I condemn murder,” Moore wrote, “and that’s why I condemn America’s broken, vile, rapacious, bloodthirsty, unethical, immoral health care industry and I condemn every one of the CEOs who are in charge of it.”The filmmaker further remarked on the rising public anger toward insurance companies, which he described as “completely justified.” Moore made it clear that he would not shy away from stoking that anger. “It is not new. It has been boiling. And I’m not going to tamp it down or ask people to shut up. I want to pour gasoline on that anger,” he added.Mangione, who was arrested Monday in Altoona, Pennsylvania, is accused of killing Thompson after allegedly harboring deep frustrations with the insurance giant. The killing took place as Thompson was walking to a conference in Manhattan. Authorities found Mangione in possession of several fake IDs, a US passport, and writings about the insurance industry, including the manifesto that praised Moore's critical work on healthcare.In the manifesto, Mangione wrote, “Frankly I do not pretend to be the most qualified person to lay out the full argument. But many have illuminated the corruption and greed (e.g.: Rosenthal, Moore), decades ago and the problems simply remain.”Moore, known for other impactful documentaries like Bowling for Columbine and Fahrenheit 9/11, called out insurance executives in his post, accusing them of causing harm comparable to the terrorists behind 9/11. “These insurance corporations and their executives have more blood on their hands than a thousand 9/11 terrorists,” Moore declared. “And that’s why they are scrubbing their executives’ profiles from their websites and putting up fences around their headquarters. Because they know what they have done.”","Michael Moore responded to the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.

Cyclone Chido batters France's Mayotte; casualties could number in thousands,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/cyclone-chido-batters-frances-mayotte-casualties-could-number-in-thousands/articleshow/116350238.cms,"Rescue workers attempt to clear a blocked road, in the aftermath of Cyclone Chido (Reuters photo)

A powerful cyclone struck the French Indian Ocean archipelago of Mayotte , potentially causing a massive loss of life. A senior local French official stated on Sunday that the death toll could be in the hundreds or even thousands. This cyclone is considered the strongest to hit the region in nearly a century.Prefect Francois-Xavier Bieuville told broadcaster Mayotte la Premiere, “I think there will definitely be several hundred, perhaps we will come close to a thousand or even several thousand” deaths. He added that confirming the final death toll will be challenging because of Muslim burial customs.Determining accurate figures might also be further complicated by the estimated 100,000 undocumented residents, according to France's interior ministry. Former nurse Ousseni Balahachi reported that some individuals avoided seeking help, fearing deportation. Many remained in place until escape became impossible.The rescue operations are underway but face challenges due to damaged airports and power infrastructure in this French Indian Ocean territory. France is sending additional soldiers, firefighters, and medical personnel to Mayotte. Supplies, including medical equipment and blood for transfusions, are arriving by plane and ship from Reunion Island.The cyclone severely damaged hospitals and schools, according to Mamoudzou Mayor Ambdilwahedou Soumaila. He told AFP that nine people were in critical condition, and 246 others were seriously injured. He described the situation as devastating.The storm also destroyed shantytowns housing a significant portion of the island's population, including many undocumented residents. Some were afraid to seek help, fearing deportation, according to former nurse Ousseni Balahachi.""Honestly, what we are experiencing is a tragedy, you feel like you are in the aftermath of a nuclear war… I saw an entire neighborhood disappear,"" Mohamed Ishmael, a resident of Mayotte's capital Mamoudzou, told Reuters.Cyclone Chido also hit the Comoros Islands, causing minor damage. It then made landfall in Mozambique, where three deaths have been reported. The remnants of the storm are expected to bring heavy rain to Malawi, Zimbabwe, and Zambia, possibly leading to floods.EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen offered support on Sunday. ""Our hearts go out to France following the devastating passage of cyclone Chido through Mayotte,"" she posted on X. ""We are ready to provide support in the days to come.""WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus expressed readiness to assist, stating on X that his organisation ""stands ready to support communities in need of essential health care"". PIROI, the regional Red Cross organisation, also indicated its preparedness to help.The cyclone destroyed informal settlements, as reported by Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau.Authorities ordered Mayotte's 320,000 residents into lockdown as the cyclone approached with winds reaching 226 kilometres per hour. The storm caused extensive infrastructure damage, particularly affecting shantytown dwellings.Emergency response efforts are underway, with medical supplies and personnel arriving by air and sea. The storm has also affected Mozambique, causing three deaths, while UNICEF provides assistance there.The UN warns that 1.7 million people face risk, with potential flooding in Malawi, Zimbabwe, and Zambia.Experts link this cyclone to climate change, with meteorologist Francois Gourand noting its intensity was enhanced by unusually warm Indian Ocean temperatures.",Cyclone Chido struck the French Indian Ocean archipelago of Mayotte.

Chinese President Xi Jinping says ‘inevitable’ for ruling party to have internal conflicts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/chinese-president-xi-jinping-says-inevitable-for-ruling-party-to-have-internal-conflicts/articleshow/116350527.cms,"File photo: Reuters

Chinese President Xi Jinping dismissed internal divisions within the ruling Communist Party as unavoidable, while calling for greater efforts to instill discipline, according to newly disclosed remarks he made at an anti-graft meeting in January.“Changes in the external environment and in the party membership will inevitably lead to various conflicts and problems within the party,” Xi said at the annual huddle of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection . “It is necessary to eliminate all kinds of negative influences in a timely manner with the courage of turning the blade inward to ensure that the party is always full of vigor and vitality.”The top leader’s remarks were revealed in the Communist Party journal Qiushi on Sunday, just weeks after another high-ranking military official was abruptly suspended from duty — that ousting was notable as Miao Hua has been considered a Xi loyalist. Other parts of Xi’s speech were previously reported by Xinhua in January, without such details.China’s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong is deepening an anti-corruption campaign that he’s used to root out unscrupulous officials and eliminate political rivals since taking office in 2012. That drive has ensnared a record number of senior officials for two straight years, and set off a purge that’s still roiling the defense establishment.That widening crackdown has contributed to bureaucratic paralysis as officials scared of making mistakes refrain from taking risks to boost the nation’s slowing economy. Top leaders appear aware of the issue, as they last week reiterated the need to fully implement the party’s instructions and step up “positive incentives” for local officials.The party doesn’t disclose all speeches delivered by Xi in full, and often releases them months — or even years — after the fact, sometimes as a way to signal policy priorities. The Qiushi article on Sunday also urged to “remove viruses that erode the healthy body of the party” in order to consolidate the Communist Party’s legitimacy.","Chinese President Xi Jinping dismissed internal divisions within the ruling Communist Party as unavoidable.

MAGA conspiracy theories link drone sightings to Project Blue Beam: Is US govt preparing a fake alien invasion?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/maga-conspiracy-theories-link-drone-sightings-to-project-blue-beam-is-us-govt-preparing-a-fake-alien-invasion/articleshow/116350016.cms,"A swarm of drones lighting up the night sky over the US East Coast has ignited a firestorm of speculation, with conspiracy theorists racing to the forefront with wild claims of government plots, alien invasions, and military cover-ups.The sightings, which began on Nov. 18 near Morris County, New Jersey, have now spread across six states, including New York, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Virginia, leaving a trail of confusion and fear.While federal agencies, including the FBI and Department of Homeland Security, have dismissed these incidents as non-threatening to national security or public safety, the internet is abuzz with more outlandish explanations.Comedian Roseanne Barr is among the most vocal, connecting the mysterious drones to a decades-old conspiracy theory known as Project Blue Beam .This theory, popularized by Infowars founder Alex Jones, suggests that the government is preparing to stage a fake alien invasion as a means to control the population through mass panic and authoritarian rule. Barr believes the drone sightings mark the beginning of this staged event.""Now you see why I mention Project Blue Beam every week on my podcast,"" Barr tweeted on Saturday, fanning the flames of paranoia.Jones, known for championing conspiracy theories, gave his endorsement to Project Blue Beam last week during an interview with ufologist Dr Steven Greer. Greer, a retired physician, voiced his concerns over the alleged plans of global elites, claiming they want to control the world through crises like a fabricated alien invasion.“They all have this agenda to want to control the world through one calamity after the other, and the big one they’ve been planning is the hoax of an alien threat from outer space,” Greer warned on the Infowars show.Meanwhile, Georgia Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, no stranger to controversial statements, has also weighed in on the mysterious drones, accusing the government of withholding the truth. On Saturday, Greene posted her belief that the drones are being controlled by the government, hiding the real purpose of their presence.“The government is in control of the drones and refuses to tell the American people what is going on. It really is that bad,” Greene wrote on X (formerly Twitter).In another post, Greene lent her support to a theory suggesting that the drones might be part of a military training program, possibly designed for future drone warfare. ""However, the government needs to come clean and tell the American people what is going on. That’s the most infuriating part to me,” Greene added.Theories of extraterrestrial involvement have also surfaced. Daily Wire commentator Matt Walsh raised the possibility of alien activity behind the drones, fueling even more speculation among followers.But some lawmakers believe the threat is much closer to home. Rep. Jeff Van Drew, a New Jersey Republican, took the dramatic step of claiming that the drones could be linked to Iran. In an interview with Fox News, he warned that the drones might be launched from an Iranian ""mothership,"" alleging that the Pentagon is hiding this information from the American public.“We aren’t being told the truth,” Van Drew told Fox News. “They are dealing with the American public like we’re stupid.”The Pentagon swiftly denied these claims. Spokesperson Sabrina Singh addressed the allegations, saying, ""There is no Iranian ship off the coast of the United States, and there’s no so-called mothership launching drones towards the United States.""As the drones continue to perplex authorities and residents alike, pressure from local officials is mounting. New York Governor Kathy Hochul called for increased federal intervention, citing a shutdown of Stewart Airfield due to drone activity.“This has gone too far,” Hochul said. “The Biden Administration must step in by directing additional federal law enforcement to New York and the surrounding region to ensure the safety of our critical infrastructure and our people.”Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer echoed this call for action, demanding answers. ""I’m pushing for answers amid these drone sightings,"" Schumer said in a statement on Saturday. He also noted that it was ""remarkable"" that the public still had more questions than answers.As tensions rise and speculation spreads, the mystery surrounding the drones remains unsolved. Is it an elaborate government cover-up , an extraterrestrial warning, or simply a case of malfunctioning military technology? Only time will tell, but for now, the skies above the East Coast are as enigmatic as ever.","Sightings began on Nov. 18 near Morris County, New Jersey, and have now spread across six states.

Adult star Lily Phillips , originally from Derbyshire, became a TikTok sensation in October after engaging in an extreme challenge—sleeping with 101 men in a single day. However, in new footage, she described the experience as ""intense"" and admitted she is uncertain whether she would recommend it to others.The 23-year-old, who has earned £2 million through OnlyFans , shared her emotional reflection in a documentary by YouTuber Josh Pieters titled ""I Slept With 100 Men in One Day"".Despite previously expressing enthusiasm for the challenge and her work, the behind-the-scenes footage shows a different side, with Lily visibly shaken and in tears.Speaking through tears, she told Pieters, ""It’s not for the weak girls, if I’m honest – it was hard. I don’t know if I’d recommend it. It’s a different feeling. It’s just one in, one out; it feels intense."" When asked if the experience was more overwhelming than she anticipated, she confirmed: ""Definitely.""Lily announced a plan to sleep with 1,000 men in one day. This announcement has caused public discussion. Some people want OnlyFans, the platform where the content would appear, to be banned. Despite the personal cost, Lily ""expressed interest in attempting an even larger challenge—sleeping with 1,000 men in a single day.""One social media user wrote, ""Lily Phillips reflects on her sadness after sleeping with 100 guys in 1 day – 1) she’s responsible for her own behaviour in this sick stunt, 2) it’s also clear OF has turned women into plastic dolls – and the 'models' themselves have bought this heartbreaking lie. BAN ONLYFANS NOW."" The tweet has since amassed over 7.7 million views and 19,000 likes.Critics claim the footage highlights the damaging impact of OnlyFans, with one commenting, ""Lily Phillips talking about how traumatic it is to sleep with 100 men is exactly why we should be against OnlyFans."" Another said, ""Look at this woman’s eyes. She has degraded herself so badly for validation. I pray she reflects on this stunt and sees her own intrinsic value. OnlyFans is making this possible, and it needs banning.""However, not everyone agrees that the platform should be banned. Some empathised with Lily, with one user writing, ""Poor girl. She needs a big hug."" Others argued she made her own choices, with one person stating, ""She chose to do this and profit from it. Are we supposed to feel sorry for her?""Supporters of OnlyFans contend the issue is more nuanced. ""OnlyFans isn’t inherently good or bad. Society needs to get better at dealing with it. Banning is very rarely, if ever, the answer,"" one user argued.","Adult star Lily Phillips became a TikTok sensation in October after engaging in an extreme challenge.

And yet, instead of riding the wave of AI euphoria, he chose to speak out against it—voicing concerns that the systems he helped create, particularly ChatGPT, were fundamentally flawed, ethically dubious, and legally questionable.His tragic death in December 2024 shocked the tech world. But it also forced many to confront the uncomfortable truths he had been raising all along.Balaji wasn’t your archetypal Silicon Valley visionary. He wasn’t a grizzled founder with a decade of battle scars or a loud-mouthed tech bro proclaiming himself the savior of humanity. He was just a kid, albeit a remarkably sharp one, who started working at OpenAI in 2020, fresh out of the University of California, Berkeley.Like many others in his field, he had been captivated by the promise of artificial intelligence: the dream that neural networks could solve humanity’s greatest problems, from curing diseases to tackling climate change. For Balaji, AI wasn’t just code—it was a kind of alchemy, a tool to turn imagination into reality.And yet, by 2024, that dream had curdled into something darker. What Balaji saw in OpenAI—and in ChatGPT, its most famous product—was a machine that, instead of helping humanity, was exploiting it.ChatGPT was—and still is—a marvel of modern technology. It can whip up poems, solve coding problems, and explain quantum physics in seconds. But behind its charm lies a deep, controversial truth: ChatGPT, like all generative AI models, was built by feeding it mountains of data scraped from the internet—data that includes copyrighted content.Balaji’s critique of ChatGPT was simple: it was too dependent on the labor of others. He argued that OpenAI had trained its models on copyrighted material without permission, violating the intellectual property rights of countless creators, from programmers to journalists.– OpenAI collected massive amounts of text from the internet, including blogs, news articles, programming forums, and books. Some of this data was publicly available, but much of it was copyrighted.– The AI analyzed this data to learn how to generate human-like text.– When you ask ChatGPT a question, it doesn’t spit out exact copies of the text it was trained on, but its responses often draw heavily from the patterns and information in the original data.Here’s the problem, as Balaji saw it: the AI might not directly copy its training data, but it still relies on it in ways that make it a competitor to the original creators. For example, if you asked ChatGPT a programming question, it might generate an answer similar to one you’d find on Stack Overflow. The result? People stop visiting Stack Overflow, and the creators who share their expertise there lose traffic, influence, and income.Balaji wasn’t alone in his concerns. In late 2023, The New York Times filed a lawsuit against OpenAI and its partner Microsoft, accusing them of illegally using millions of articles to train their models. The Times argued that this unauthorized use directly harmed their business:ChatGPT could generate summaries or rewordings of Times articles, effectively competing with the original pieces.By generating content similar to what news organizations produce, AI systems threaten to replace traditional journalism.The lawsuit also raised questions about the ethics of using copyrighted material to create tools that compete with the very sources they rely on. Microsoft and OpenAI defended their practices, arguing that their use of data falls under the legal doctrine of ""fair use."" This argument hinges on the idea that the data was ""transformed"" into something new and that ChatGPT doesn’t directly replicate copyrighted works. But critics, including Balaji, believed this justification was tenuous at best.Balaji’s criticisms fit into a larger narrative of skepticism around large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. Here are the most common critiques:AI models scrape copyrighted content without permission, undermining the rights of creators.By providing free, AI-generated alternatives, these systems devalue the original works they draw from—be it news articles, programming tutorials, or creative writing.Generative AI often produces “hallucinations”—fabricated information presented as fact—undermining trust in AI-generated content.AI companies rarely disclose what data their models are trained on, making it hard to assess the full scope of potential copyright violations.As AI models mimic human creativity, they may crowd out original creators, leaving the internet awash in regurgitated, derivative content.What set Balaji apart wasn’t just his critique of AI—it was the clarity and conviction with which he presented his case. He believed that the unchecked growth of generative AI posed immediate dangers, not hypothetical ones. As more people relied on AI tools like ChatGPT, the platforms and creators that fueled the internet’s knowledge economy were being pushed aside.Balaji also argued that the legal framework governing AI was hopelessly outdated. U.S. copyright law, written long before the rise of AI, doesn’t adequately address questions about data scraping, fair use, and market harm. He called for new regulations that would ensure creators are fairly compensated for their contributions while still allowing AI innovation to flourish.Suchir Balaji wasn’t a tech titan or a revolutionary visionary. He was just a young researcher grappling with the implications of his work. In speaking out against OpenAI, he forced his peers—and the world—to confront the ethical dilemmas at the heart of generative AI. His death is a reminder that the pressures of innovation, ambition, and responsibility can weigh heavily, even on the brightest minds. But his critique of AI lives on, raising a fundamental question: as we build smarter machines, are we being fair to the humans who make their existence possible?","Suchir Balaji was a 26-year-old researcher who worked with OpenAI, one of the most influential AI companies on the planet.

Mitt Romney: Mitt Romney says he still doesn't like Trump but JD Vance should be 2028 nominee,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/mitt-romney-says-he-still-doesnt-like-trump-but-jd-vance-should-be-2028-nominee/articleshow/116342045.cms,"Mitt Romney who is soon to retire from Congress said JD Vance should be the presidential nominee in 2028.

Donald Trump critic Republican senator Mitt Romney said his stance against Donald Trump has not changed since 2016 but he believes that the President-elect deserves a chance. The Utah Republican, the 2012 GOP presidential nominee, told CNN that MAGA has become the Republican Party and the party is synonymous to Donald Trump today. Romney said in 2016 he felt that Trump was wrong for the country and the party and considered his win impossible but he was wrong.“I agree with him (Trump) on a lot of policy fronts. I disagree with him on some things,” Romney said of Trump. “But it’s like, OK, give him a chance to do what he said he’s gonna do and see how it works out.”Romney said he does not fear that his open stance against Trump would make him a target for political retribution as he believes that Trump would now try and focus on the future.Notwithstanding his dislike for Trump, Romney said vice-president-elect JD Vance is a smart person and very well-spoken. “If you were to ask me who the nominee will be in 2028, I think it will be JD Vance, all right? He’s smart, well-spoken, part of the MAGA movement,” Romney said, downplaying past criticism of Vance as comments from “long ago,” and saying, “I’m not going to rehash history, and we’ve worked together in the Senate together since then.”Romney said Trump deserves the credit for bringing working-class voters to the GOP from Democrats. “Look, the Republican Party has become the party of the working-class, middle-class voter, and you’ve got to give Donald Trump credit for having done that, taking that away from the Democrats,” he said.On his unsuccessful campaign against Obama in 2012, he said Obama was ""“in some respects smart to go after me and say, ‘Here’s a rich business guy, we’re going to characterize him as a plutocrat that doesn’t care about people.’ He went with that narrative, put it out there before I could really effectively respond and was successful in doing so.”",Romney said in 2016 he felt that Trump was wrong for the country and the party and considered his win impossible but he was wrong.

A strategic exit for Guilfoyle

Trump Jr's public show of support

Kimberly Guilfoyle and Donald Trump Jr have reportedly parted ways, with sources claiming Guilfoyle’s fashion choices played a key role in their split. According to a Trump insider quoted by The Daily Beast, Trump Jr sought a new partner who could better win over his father, Donald Trump, and align with his expectations.Last week, Trump Jr was spotted holding hands with Palm Beach socialite and former model Bettina Anderson, signaling a new chapter in his love life. Reports by People indicate that Guilfoyle and Trump Jr's relationship had already been under strain for months, with Anderson entering the picture about six months ago. Sources suggest Trump Jr even took Anderson on a trip to Alaska while still in a relationship with Guilfoyle.A political insider revealed that Trump Jr had voiced dissatisfaction with Guilfoyle’s wardrobe, describing it as “too stiff” and “always professional.” Her signature look—brightly colored, form-fitting dresses paired with high heels — didn’t align with his vision. “Don Jr has been telling people for months that Kim is so uptight and never looks relaxed or casual. The tight dresses need to go, and she has been told that,” the source told People.Trump Jr's pursuit of Anderson reportedly stems from her ability to fit into the Waspy, high-society circles of Palm Beach—something that appeals to his desire to impress his father. “Someone like Bettina, who is and has been a model, is exactly the kind of person who would win over Donald Sr,” a source close to the Trump family told The Independent.Interestingly, Anderson reportedly pushed for Guilfoyle to be sent abroad as her relationship with Trump Jr grew. On Wednesday, Guilfoyle was named US Ambassador to Greece by Donald Trump. Sources said this decision was delayed until after the elections to avoid impacting Donald Trump Sr's campaign. “They waited for the election to pass but didn’t want the split to hurt Donald in any way,” a political source explained as reported by the People.Despite the swirling rumors, Trump Jr publicly praised Guilfoyle’s appointment on X (formerly Twitter), calling her “a fantastic America First leader.” The couple, who began dating in 2018 following Trump Jr's divorce from Vanessa Trump, has not commented on the split.As of now, Trump Jr appears focused on his future with Anderson, while Guilfoyle embraces her new role as ambassador. Whether the rift stemmed from fashion or other factors, one thing is certain—the Trump family drama never fails to captivate.","Kimberly Guilfoyle and Donald Trump Jr have reportedly parted ways.

Drones mystery: Andrew Tate demands answers from Musk,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/drones-mystery-andrew-tate-demands-answers-from-musk-explain-elon/articleshow/116349237.cms,"""Please explain the drones"": Andrew Tate's viral plea to Elon Musk amid growing speculation

Elon Musk on modern warfare: Fighter jets obsolete, drones are the future

Drone sightings create public alarm

Authorities, lawmakers address growing concerns

Public remains skeptical

Amid growing speculation about mysterious drones flying over New Jersey and the East Coast that have captured national attention, controversial British-American influencer Andrew Tate took to Twitter to demand answers from SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk.Tate’s tweet, now viral, read: “Hello @elonmusk. You have SpaceX and speak to the most important people in the world. Please explain the drones. Thanks, The World.” Musk has yet to respond.Notably, billionaire entrepreneur Musk, recently selected by US President-elect Donald Trump to spearhead efforts to reduce federal government spending, made waves with his bold critique of modern fighter jets and his endorsement of drone warfare.“Manned fighter jets are obsolete in the age of drones anyway. Will just get pilots killed,” Musk wrote on his social media platform, X, where he also leads companies like SpaceX and Tesla.In a series of posts, Musk specifically targeted the F-35 Lightning II, calling it a “shit design” and pointing to consistent manufacturing and performance issues outlined in declassified Pentagon testing reports. He argued that drone swarms controlled by AI hive minds represent the future of air combat.“Meanwhile, some idiots are still building manned fighter jets like the F-35,” Musk commented in a post on November 24, alongside a video showing hundreds of drones flying in coordinated formation. In a follow-up post, Musk elaborated, “The F-35 design was broken at the requirements level, because it was required to be too many things to too many people. This made it an expensive & complex jack of all trades, master of none. Success was never in the set of possible outcomes.”His remarks had real-world consequences, as Lockheed Martin, the F-35's primary contractor, saw its stock drop by over 3% following Musk’s comments.Notably, Musk’s statements align with his growing advocacy for unmanned combat systems, which he argues will revolutionize warfare while saving lives. The tech magnate has been vocal about the inefficiency of manned aircraft and has repeatedly emphasized the inevitability of AI-controlled drones dominating the battlefield.The Pentagon has yet to respond to Musk's remarks, but his influence on the defense industry and public opinion is undeniable.Residents in southern and northern New Jersey have described seeing brightly lit objects moving swiftly and emitting a humming noise. In Elsinboro, Susan and Lorelai Woodruff reported nightly visits from these objects since late November.""I feel like our privacy is invaded,"" said Lorelai, 52. Portrait photographer Jenna Keen, also from Elsinboro, started a Facebook group to track the sightings, which gained over 600 members within hours.For many, the unexplained drones have disrupted daily life. Mendham resident Emily Ferguson shared that her children have started closing blinds out of fear. “The kids are asking, ‘What’s going on?’ and I don’t have answers,” she said.Others, like Michael Ash of Westfield, have observed multiple objects within minutes. “This is such a widespread phenomenon; it’s impossible to ignore,” Ash stated.Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas sought to reassure the public, stating, ""Some of those drone sightings are, in fact, drones. Some are manned aircraft mistaken for drones. Right now, we are not aware of any malicious activity.""Still, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have criticized federal agencies for their lack of transparency. Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer has called for immediate deployment of drone-detection systems in New York and New Jersey, emphasizing, “We need more tools to address this issue.”Meanwhile, Governor Kathy Hochul announced that New York has begun receiving drone-detection technology but urged Congress to pass legislation granting local law enforcement greater authority to address drone threats.Former President Donald Trump weighed in, calling for immediate action: “Let the public know, and now. Otherwise, shoot them down!!!”Despite reassurances, residents remain uneasy. “It’s unnerving to walk out your door and see this,” said Kieran Kelly, a Morristown technology consultant. Ferguson echoed the frustration: “Officials are trying to gaslight us, acting like we’re conspiracy theorists.”With theories ranging from extraterrestrial activity to military operations, social media remains flooded with videos and debates.

Among many theories, most of them conspiracy theories, about the mystery drones flying above New Jersey, an explanation offered by the CEO of Saxon Aerospace, John Ferguson, has gone viral. He explained that drones can't see, and hence, there's no use in deploying drones at night unless someone is looking for something—or smelling something.“Back in the 1980s, Ronald Reagan had dismantled the nuclear program with Russia and there were countless nuclear missiles that were disarmed and disposed of. I believe there were over 80 nuclear warheads that were in Ukraine that came up missing. We don't know where they are. Maybe somebody does but nobody really knows where these are and I speak with some high-level government officials on this stuff,"" he said.Then he wet on to talk about a gentleman who was trying to raise an alarm with the highest level of the government over one particular nuclear warhead that he physically touched that was left over from Ukraine and he knew that that thing was headed for the US. ""We all know that the US govt is pushing to get into a war with Russia. We all feel it. We all see it,"" the expert said.""Drones have no use at night unless you are doing some intelligence work, looking for some bad guys or looking for a victim or doing some type of military project. Drones can see stuff unless they have thermal optics. You need mapping during the day. The only reason will be if you are looking for something -- a person, or a gas,"" Ferguson said.Ferguson added that it's his personal opinion that these mystery drones are not probably nefarious in their intent and they are flying so low to smell something on the ground that's very important.In the latest response to the situation, Feds said the are going to deploy a high-tech drone detection system to New York. “In response to my calls for additional resources, our federal partners are deploying a state-of-the-art drone detection system to New York State,” Gov Kathy Hochul said.“I want to assure the American public that we are on it,” Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week.”","The CEO of a drone manufacturing company offered his opinion about the mystery drones flying around New Jersey.

Like, well, I don’t know,” Christie said.“If you don’t fill that vacuum, all the conspiracy theories get filled in there,” he said. “You’ve got people like Congressman Jeff Van drew saying there’s an Iranian mothership off the coast of New Jersey. Absolutely not true, and provably now not true, and he’s had to back off that.”“You can’t have conspiracy theorists filling the space, but the Biden administration and state authorities have to be more vocal and let people know exactly what they’re doing,” he added.“It’s a newish technology to most people, and they’re worried about it and concerned.

US-based interfaith couple cancel Aligarh wedding reception after right-wing groups protest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-based-interfaith-couple-cancel-aligarh-wedding-reception-after-right-wing-groups-protest/articleshow/116349196.cms,"AGRA: A US-based interfaith couple from Aligarh had to cancel their wedding reception in their home town after protests by right-wing outfits, who claimed the event could disrupt communal harmony. Scheduled for Dec 21 at a marriage hall on G T Road, the reception was called off after members of Bajrang Dal, Karni Sena, and Brahman Maha Sabha marched to the collectorate, submitted a memorandum to officials, and warned of potential unrest if the reception was allowed. Under mounting pressure, the families decided to cancel the event, citing safety concerns.Ashar Choudhury, 30, a senior executive at a US-based multinational firm, and Avani Bhargava, 29, an MBA graduate working for a private firm, married four months ago in the US and registered their wedding under the Special Marriages Act at the Indian Consulate in San Francisco. They recently arrived in Aligarh, where their families had planned a reception for relatives and friends.Protests erupted after an invitation card for the reception, reading, ""We joyfully request your presence to bless the newlyweds Avani and Ashar,"" was widely circulated on social media. Hindu groups took to the streets, claiming the event could disturb communal harmony.On Friday, members of the groups marched to the Collectorate and submitted a memorandum to ADM (City) Amit Kumar Bhatt, demanding the event's cancellation. They also warned the district administration and the marriage hall's owner of the consequences if the event proceeded.Thakur Gyanendra Singh Chauhan, state president of the All-India Karni Sena, alleged that the reception was a ""clear case of love jihad"". He said, ""We will not step back, even if it means entering the hotel or challenging the administration."" Former mayor of Aligarh Shakuntala Bharti echoed similar concerns. ""The reception should not take place under any circumstances. If any incident occurs, the hotel owner and district administration will be held responsible,"" she said.Bajrang Dal coordinator Gaurav Sharma also voiced objections, saying, ""While the Constitution permits adults to marry by choice, hosting such an event in a sensitive city like Aligarh could incite unrest. We are not against the marriage itself, but such an event should not happen here.""The families announced the cancellation on social media, citing ""unforeseen circumstances"" for the decision. The acting station house officer of the local police stated that no untoward incidents occurred during the protests. A family friend told TOI, ""The event was scheduled to take place in a few days, and a marriage hall was booked. But due to the protests and concerns for the safety of guests, both families decided to cancel the programme.""Bhatt confirmed that he had received a memorandum from the protesters and the matter was under review.

Amid hysteria over mysterious drones spotted over New Jersey, former CIA operations officer Laura Ballman presented her theory that probably this is a classified operation being executed by the Biden administration otherwise why the White House would assert that it was nothing illegal, she asked. The drone sightings have been continuing for the past few weeks with no scientific or logical explanation coming from the government. The administration also dismissed any apprehension over it.""Deducing the statements from [National Security spokesman] John Kirby that these drones are not operating illegally, coupled with several op-eds that have been out there in the last 24 hours about the need to look at our detection systems, makes me think perhaps this is actually a classified exercise to test either evasion technology or detection technology in urban areas,"" Ballman said.

Attempts for lower electricity prices

World Bank goals

The World Bank has withdrawn a budget support loan of more than $500 million to Pakistan as a result of the country failing to fulfil critical conditions within the time limit. The required conditions included revising the purchase power agreement in relation to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor , according to The Express Tribune.The Washington-based international lender also declared that it would not be sanctioning any new budget supporting loans to the country during the current fiscal year which has sent a shock to the Pakistani economy as the country has almost exhausted its loan quota.""No budget support is planned for the current fiscal year, which ends in June 2025,"" the World Bank spokesperson stated.For this fiscal year, the IMF has identified a $2.5 billion external financing gap that needs to be addressed through new loans.The World Bank has canceled a loan of $500 to $600 million meant for Pakistan under the Affordable and Clean Energy Program (PACE-II), government sources revealed. Initially set at $500 million, the loan amount was later raised to $600 million to help address Pakistan's external financing gap, quoted news agency ANI.The PACE program was approved by the World Bank in June 2021, with the first tranche of USD 400 million already released. The second installment depended on meeting several conditions, such as holding talks with all Independent Power Producers (IPPs), especially the Chinese power plants built under CPEC. It was discovered that no progress had been made in renegotiating agreements with CPEC-related power plants as China has consistently refused to revisit these deals or restructure the energy debt, which amounts to approximately $16 billion.To reduce electricity costs, the government is renegotiating energy agreements with power plants set up under the 1994 and 2002 policies. The Chinese-owned power plants, along with several government-run plants, including four LNG-based and two nuclear plants, fall under the 2015 energy policy. Though the government has tried negotiating over 22 energy contracts yet, no significant reductions have been made in electricity prices which linger from 65 Pakistani Rupees (PKR) to 70 PKR.A spokesperson for the World Bank confirmed that ""slower-than-expected progress led to a shift in strategy in our support for reform"" in Pakistan's energy sector. The spokesperson further elaborated that the lender has been supporting power sector reforms through the PACE initiative.Even though slower progress led the World Bank to revise its lending strategy, the World Bank has continued its support by directly financing low-cost hydropower projects, including an additional $1 billion for the Dasu Hydropower project.Furthermore, the Bank has also continued working with all stakeholders to expedite the implementation of the Electricity Distribution Efficiency Improvement Project, aimed at improving efficiency in the power distribution sector. It has also offered technical assistance to promote private sector involvement in power distribution companies (DISCOs).For the ongoing fiscal year, Pakistan anticipated $2 billion in loans from the World Bank.However, by the end of the July-October period, only $349 million, 18 per cent of the planned amount, had been disbursed.Under the PACE-II program, Pakistan was expected to tackle inefficiencies in power distribution companies and reduce the growth of circular debt. However, the government has been unable to achieve either of these objectives. The government had approved a roadmap under PACE-I to encourage private sector involvement in the distribution sector, but it remained far from implementation.The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) recently reported that inefficiencies in power distribution companies led to losses of PKR 660 billion in the last fiscal year. During the same period, circular debt surged to PKR 2.393 trillion, far exceeding the targets set in agreements with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.The successful implementation of this roadmap was essential for evaluating the progress of the power sector reform program, but it was not carried out.",The World Bank has withdrawn a budget support loan of more than $500 million to Pakistan as a result of the country failing to fulfil critical conditions.

Among the detainees, the army initiated military trials against 103 accused on charges of treason and attempting to incite mutiny in the military. Though Khan was released after three days, he was rearrested two months later in another corruption case and has been in jail since. There have been widespread reports that the military also plans to prosecute him under the same charges. He, however, has already been indicted by an anti-terrorism court over charges linked to the May 9 riots.The seven-member SC constitution bench was formed as a result of a controversial amendment to the constitution in Oct this year.“The final judgment of 85 persons who are under custody and facing trial before the military courts be announced and remissions admissible to the said persons be granted, and persons who can be released after remissions they be released forthwith, and persons who have to yet undergo the sentence awarded to them, their custody be handed over to the concerned jail authorities,” Friday’s court order read.The Pakistan Army Act of 1952 had established military courts, which function under a separate legal system, primarily for trial of military personnel or enemies of the state.The decision to use military courts for civilians was taken by Imran’sadversary, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, during his first term in office, and was backed by the powerful military establishment.","Pakistan’s Supreme Court on Friday allowed military courts, though conditionally, to announce the reserved verdicts of 85 civilians tried for alleged involvement in May 9 riots.

Respiratory illnesses soar in Pakistan as dust pollution and poverty worsen health crisis,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/respiratory-illnesses-soar-in-pakistan-as-dust-pollution-and-poverty-worsen-health-crisis/articleshow/116262633.cms,"KARACHI: As winter sets in, there has been a noticeable rise in Pakistcitizens respiratory illnesses over the past few weeks.Experts suggest that this year's case numbers are considerably higher compared to previous years. They attribute the increase to deteriorating air quality, particularly due to severe dust pollution affecting nearly all city roads, compounded by the significant loss of green spaces as reported by Dawn.Experts also connected the rise in respiratory illnesses to the increasing poverty levels, driven by an unprecedented surge in the prices of essential food and medicine, which has significantly heightened people's susceptibility to illness and disability.Dr. Javaid Ahmed Khan, a senior professor and consultant pulmonologist at Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH), explained to Dawn, ""While respiratory disease cases typically rise with the onset of winter, due to colder and drier air trapping more pollutants, this year the numbers have nearly doubled. This applies to both inpatients and outpatients.""According to the Dawn report, Dr. Khan attributed the rise in respiratory diseases to heavy dust pollution, stating, ""I believe air quality has deteriorated significantly. There is extensive roadwork throughout the city, trees are being cut down, and people continue to burn waste on the streets. There is no regulation of vehicles emitting toxic fumes.""He further explained that poor air quality heightens the risk of bronchitis by exposing individuals to pollutants such as dust, fumes, traffic emissions, and chemicals. This pollution weakens the immune system, making people more susceptible to lung infections and other illnesses.""Any type of pollution impacts the immune system, a fact supported by numerous studies. People living in polluted environments are more prone to pneumonia, upper respiratory tract infections, allergic rhinitis, and even tuberculosis.""Dr. Khan explained that irritants, including particulate matter 2.5, damage the respiratory system's immune defences, which normally protect against various germs.When the immune system is compromised, the body becomes highly susceptible to infections and diseases, including cancer. He pointed out that the average diameter of human hair is about 70 micrometres, while particulate matter 2.5 consists of fine particles that are 2.5 micrometres or smaller. Additionally, Dr. Khan noted that research has linked poor air quality to a higher incidence of cardiovascular diseases, as these tiny particles enter the bloodstream and can block arteries.Supporting Dr. Khan's view, Dr. Abdul Ghafoor Shoro, a senior general physician practicing in Keamari, reported a 50 per cent increase in respiratory illnesses, including asthma, bronchitis, flu, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and pneumonia in recent weeks.He stated, ""From Malir, Quaidabad, and Korangi to Gulistan-i-Jauhar, Mauripur, Keamari, Orangi, and Saddar, heavy dust pollution is widespread due to roadwork and construction activities. There's no way for the public to escape the pollution.""Dr. Sajjad Siddiqui, a senior general physician, emphasised that the rise in diseases is also linked to people's declining purchasing power. ""The public is living under extreme hardship, forced to drink contaminated water in areas lacking gas, with people relying on costly cylinders to cook just enough food to survive. When they fall ill, they can't afford the necessary medicines,"" he lamented.Dr. Liaquat Ali Halo, Additional Medical Superintendent at Dr. Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi, reported a 25 to 30 per cent increase in respiratory illnesses, particularly among children, at the hospital's chest department.""We are seeing children with pneumonia and adults with COPD and asthma. Often, COPD patients are individuals who work in polluted environments or are smokers.""Experts recommend that people wear high-quality face masks or use cloth coverings (or helmets for those riding bikes) when outdoors, although these measures cannot fully protect against toxic air. ""Indoor air quality is just as crucial,"" emphasised Dr. Halo.""It's important to ensure proper ventilation in homes, even during winter. People should avoid burning mosquito coils and incense, as there are increasing concerns about their harmful health effects."" He also noted that using gas stoves in poorly ventilated kitchens can further degrade air quality.","There has been a noticeable rise in Pakistcitizens respiratory illnesses over the past few weeks.

Bin Laden, Tehran and the Taliban



'Murdered my dreams'



PARACHINAR: Once again, Ali Ghulam receives mourners at his home -- his brother and nephew killed 40 years apart in the same sectarian conflict that was reignited this year in northwest Pakistan, claiming 200 lives since July alone.Thousands of residents are stranded without food and medicine in parts of remote Kurram district, which borders Afghanistan, as the government struggles to end clashes between Sunni and Shiite Muslims stemming from decades-old tensions over farmland.""Our generations yearn for peace,"" 72-year-old Ghulam told AFP at his home in Parachinar, the main town and a Shiite bastion of the restive district.The latest flare-up of violence has ""reopened wounds"" he said, recalling how his brother was killed in an attack in 1987 that also wounded another three of his brothers.Kurram, known as the ""Parrot's Beak"" for its protrusion into neighbouring Afghanistan, is bounded by dizzyingly high mountains, the northern flank of which includes the Tora Bora caves where Al Qaeda founder and 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden once hid.Pakistan's northwestern border districts have long been a haven for various militant groups, with militants and weapons able to flow largely unchecked in and out of Afghanistan.""I have never experienced peace in my life and have no hope my coming generations will live free of fear,"" Ghulam said.Tribal and family feuds are common in Pakistan.But they can be particularly protracted and violent in the mountainous tribal northwest, where communities live by traditional codes of honour and revenge.The latest round of violence in Kurram erupted in May and intensified in July, when gunmen opened fire on a council of elders attempting to settle the latest round of disagreements over land.Various truces announced since then have held for only weeks or days at a time.More than 300 shops and over 200 homes in Sunni areas have been destroyed, often by fire, and hundreds of families have fled.Pakistan is a Sunni-majority country with Shiites making up 10 to 15 percent of the population, or at least 25 million people.Members of the two sects have periodically clashed in Kurram, where Shiites are particularly vulnerable as they must pass through Sunni-majority neighbourhoods to access essential services.Kurram's location on the frontier of Pakistan and Afghanistan put it at the heart of the religious and political upheavals of the last five decades.In 1979, Shiites led a revolution in Iran and later that year the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, prompting Sunni hardliners there to rise up against them.Pakistan's military ruler Zia-ul-Haq aligned with them, funnelling thousands of Sunni militants into Afghanistan through Kurram.""It became a hub for arms supply to Afghanistan, including landmines, mortar shells, and weapons of all kinds. Every household in Kurram had a stockpile of weapons,"" Malik Attaullah Khan, a local tribal elder told AFP.Khan, who signed a 2007 agreement aimed at bringing peace to Kurram, criticised the government for failing to ""fulfil in its responsibilities"" in enforcing land settlements.The ethnic Pashtun heartland was merged into the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in 2018, but the Pakistani state maintains limited control in the merged districts.In rural areas of Pakistan, villages often bypass the formal justice system and men-only ""jirgas"" or councils made up of respected village elders resolve disputes, sometimes in the form of fines or land reallocation.Ghulam's nephew was killed along with at least 42 others last month, when Sunni gunmen opened fire on a convoy of Shiites being escorted by the police to their homes.In retaliation, a market in a Sunni-dominated area was set on fire.Syed Ghani Shah told AFP his cousin was burned to death inside his shop.""When we buried him, he was so unrecognisable that we couldn't even let his parents see his face,"" Shah said.""Can we ever make peace after all this? Never, if we ever get the chance, we will surely avenge our blood,"" he warned.Authorities have enforced curfews and road closures to reduce the chances of violence breaking out, providing escorts through high-risk areas and using helicopters to deliver supplies.But Akbar Khan, a representative of Pakistan's independent Human Rights Commission told AFP that the state needs to do more to resolve the issue.""In the past, jirgas were successful because they had the full support of the state. Now, the authorities don't even provide the expenses needed to hold a jirga,"" he said.Fatima Ahmed's husband was killed last month while travelling to Islamabad to arrange her admission to medical college.""I don't want to live a life without him. I've lost my will to exist,"" the 21-year-old told AFP.""They haven't just martyred my husband -- they've also murdered my dreams with him,"" she said, bursting into tears.",Violence in northwest Pakistan has killed 200 people since July. Clashes between Sunni and Shiite Muslims stem from decades-old tensions over farmland. Residents stranded without food and medicine in parts of remote Kurram district. Pakistan's northwestern border districts have long been a haven for militant groups.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116233302,imgsize-616661,width-400,resizemode-4/116233302.jpg"
"Pak ex-ISI chief indicted on charges of treason, graft, misuse of authority",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pak-ex-isi-chief-indicted-on-charges-of-treason-graft-misuse-of-authority/articleshow/116191351.cms,"Faiz Hameed

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's former Inter-Services Intelligence chief, Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd), has been formally indicted on a number of charges, including engaging in political activities and violating a law on official secrets, during field general court martial (FGCM) proceedings against him, military's media affairs wing said Tuesday.Army's media arm ISPR said FGCM also charged Hameed with compromising state security and interests, abusing authority and resources and causing undue harm to individuals. ISPR said proceedings against Hameed were initiated on Aug 12 under provisions of Pakistan Army Act.Hameed, who served as ISI director-general from June 2019 to Oct 2021, was taken into custody from Rawalpindi four months ago when he was summoned to a meeting by a senior military officer. He was arrested over accusations about his involvement in land grabbing and snatching valuables and property from the owner of a private housing society. His arrest busted the myth that ISI chiefs were untouchable in a country where powerful generals have long wielded unparalleled influence in state affairs.""During the process, involvement of Lt Gen Faiz Hamid (Retd) in events related to creating agitation and unrest, leading up to multiple incidents including but not limited to the May 9, 2023 incident for fomenting instability, at the behest of and in collusion with vested political interests, is also being separately investigated,"" ISPR said. The May 9 incident referred to countrywide protests when PTI supporters stormed army installations and govt buildings following the arrest of party chief and ex-PM Imran Khan for alleged graft. To many, Hameed's close association with Khan was the reason behind his arrest. Khan wanted to continue with Hameed as ISI head but then army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa had been adamant on replacing him. Bajwa eventually succeeded and Khan could serve only a few months in office; he was later removed through a no-confidence.Independent observers say action against Hameed could put Khan under pressure and pave the way for the ex-PM to face a military court on charges of treason and attempting to incite mutiny in the military.","Pakistan's former Inter-Services Intelligence chief, Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd), has been formally indicted on a number of charges.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has been ranked among the lowest globally for slow mobile and broadband internet speeds in the world in Oct, revealed data shared by Ookla’s Speedtest Global Index on Monday.Since Mid-July, internet users in Pakistan have reported frequent slowdowns and persistent connectivity challenges in the country, causing widespread disruptions to browsing and media sharing.The global index placed Pakistan at 100 out of 111 countries in mobile internet speeds, and 141 out of 158 countries in broadband speeds.The country’s regular internet interruptions were accompanied by reports of restricted access to virtual private networks (VPNs), which many Pakistanis use to access X and other restricted websites.According to the World Population Review, which analysed data from Ookla’s Speedtest Global Index and Cable, Pakistan’s average download speed was 7.85 MBPS, with a median mobile download speed of 19.59 MBPS and a median broadband download speed of 15.52 MBPS.Internet service providers and the business community blamed the slump in services on the govt’s installation of a Chinese-built national internet firewall, a combination of hardware and software used by authorities to control and monitor internet traffic, acting as a digital gatekeeper that decides what data to allow or block.The national firewall, also being installed on servers of major internet providers, has the capability to detect and slow digital communication between individual users.Last month, Pakistan home ministry had sought a ban on unregulated use of VPNs, citing their use by terrorists to “facilitate violent activities” and to “access pornographic and blasphemous content”.“VPNs are increasingly being exploited by terrorists to facilitate violent activities and financial transactions in Pakistan,” the ministry said in a letter to the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA).","Pakistan has been ranked among the lowest globally for slow mobile and broadband internet speeds in the world.

"Pakistan's ISI pushes drug addicts as terror couriers in Indian jails, say officials",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistans-isi-pushes-drug-addicts-as-terror-couriers-in-indian-jails-say-officials/articleshow/116116037.cms,"During searches, security personnel discovered a damp paper containing Arabic writing though it was not legible, the officials said

NEW DELHI: Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI has reportedly resorted to infiltrating individuals under the influence of drugs or posing as mentally disturbed into India to utilise them to deliver critical messages to hardcore terrorists incarcerated in the country's prisons. Officials said that more than 10 such cases have been reported since July this year in which Pakistani nationals have entered India from their country and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Many of them have been sent to prisons in Jammu, Punjab and Rajasthan.The officials said security agencies suspect these individuals are Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) couriers tasked with relaying important communication to the jailed terrorists wherever possible.Interrogation of these individuals typically shows that they have been trained in resistance techniques to withstand questioning by security personnel.The behaviour displayed by those apprehended has raised suspicions among officials, who suggest that their superficial details and evasive responses indicate a potentially larger agenda behind their infiltration, possibly stemming from the fear of repercussions from their handlers.They explained that the use of mobile phones and the internet leaves behind electronic footprints that could expose the plans of both state and non-state actors operating across the border. As a result, the ISI has adopted this new modus operandi.The infiltration strategy reportedly includes women and minors, who may also serve as couriers. In a notable incident in July, a minor from Pakistan's Attock was intercepted in Punjab.During searches, security personnel discovered a damp paper containing Arabic writing though it was not legible, the officials said.The ISI's infiltration tactics have been linked to drug smuggling operations. In one case from Bijnour village in Rajasthan, a Pakistani national posing as mentally disturbed finally spilled the beans during intense questioning that he had been hired by two drug lords in Pakistan -- Sarfaraz Johiya and Nawaz -- to facilitate narcotics trafficking into India and gather information on the deployment of Border Security Force (BSF) troops.In another recent incident, a Pakistani youth named Mohammed Asad from Lahore drove to the zero line on his motorcycle and seemingly awaited arrest by the BSF. During interrogation, he claimed to have had a family dispute over his girlfriend.The officials noted that Asad, who was subsequently moved to prison, may have been acting as a courier. Security agencies have requested additional custody for extended interrogation.In October, a 31-year-old man who identified himself as Shahid Imran entered India through the Jammu sector, claiming that he wanted to visit a Kali temple to get married.The officials explained that such infiltrators are generally booked under the Foreigners Act and Passports Act, for which the punishment ranges from two years to eight years in prison and following this, they are deported.They said that in the late-1990s and early-2000s, ISI exploited the Samjhauta Express, the rail link between India and Pakistan, for covert courier operations, employing individuals known as ""sawari operators"".This service continued until February 2019, when the train service was halted.The ""sawari operators"" played a crucial role in smuggling drugs and transporting funds intended to finance terrorist activities in Jammu and Kashmir, as well as Punjab.However, following a significant crackdown by authorities, these operations were effectively curtailed, leading to the arrest and imprisonment of numerous individuals involved in such activities.Recent developments suggest that the ISI's current method of sending couriers mirrors these past tactics.The officials said that the infiltration strategies being employed now are reminiscent of the past, as the agency seeks new ways to bypass law enforcement and deliver crucial communication and resources across the border.","Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI has reportedly resorted to infiltrating individuals under the influence of drugs or posing as mentally disturbed into India.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan ’s imprisoned ex-prime minister Imran Khan has threatened to launch a nationwide civil disobedience movement, in an apparent bid to keep his public mobilisation campaign intact and to force the country’s powerful authorities to agree to his demands.Less than two weeks after his “final call” protest in Islamabad was violently suppressed, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chief has asked his supporters to converge on Dec 13 in the northwestern city of Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, to pay homage to party workers who were killed in the crackdown by security forces in Islamabad.His call for protest in Islamabad had mobilised thousands of supporters, primarily from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, a province governed by his party. Imran’s party is believed to have organised the Dec 13 gathering in Peshawar keeping in mind his popularity in the region.Imran has also constituted a five-member team to discuss two key demands with govt: release of undertrial prisoners and a judicial probe into the crackdown on the Nov 26 protest march and the violence on May 9 last year. On both dates, PTI workers and Imran’s supporters held major protests, but faced a backlash from govt and security forces.“If these two demands are not accepted, a civil disobedience movement will begin on Dec 14. Govt will bear full responsibility for the consequences,” the PTI chief’s post in Urdu read.“As part of the movement, we will urge overseas Pakistanis to limit remittances and start a boycott campaign. In the second phase, we will escalate our actions further,” he added.The announcement followed Imran’s recent indictment for his involvement in an attack on military headquarters on May 9 last year, while he was also slapped with charges of terrorism for his role in protests that besieged Islamabad last month.Meanwhile, data submitted before the Islamabad high court revealed that the 72-year old cricketer-turned-politician is currently facing 188 criminal cases and inquiries.

Growing threat from Baloch separatists

Sectarian violence fuels instability

Border tensions and counterterrorism efforts

What lies ahead

Pakistan witnessed a sharp rise in terror attacks in November, with 61 incidents marking a 27% increase from the previous month, according to a report by the Pak Institute for Peace Studies (PIPS). The number of fatalities also surged by 69%, climbing from 100 in October to 169, with 225 others injured.The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), a banned group, carried out 12 attacks in November, including three high-impact incidents that resulted in 45 deaths. These figures surpassed the fatalities caused by the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), indicating a shift in the BLA's operational strategy. Experts suggest this escalation requires a reassessment of counterterrorism tactics.The majority of these attacks in Balochistan targeted security forces and civilians. Notable incidents included an assault on the Quetta railway station, an attack on a police van in Mastung, and a strike on a security check-post in Kalat, which collectively accounted for 91% of the province’s fatalities.Sectarian violence added another layer to the country's security challenges, particularly in the Kurram district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP). Seven incidents, including two terror attacks and five sectarian clashes, claimed 115 lives and left 137 injured. The violence was triggered by an attack on passenger buses on November 21, which spiraled into broader sectarian unrest.KP remained the most affected province, with 41 terrorist attacks leading to 114 deaths and 95 injuries. The TTP, Hafiz Gul Bahadur Group, Lashkar-i-Islam, and other local factions were linked to most of these incidents.The report also highlighted six incidents of border violence along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, resulting in 25 terrorist deaths and 11 injuries. This underscores the ongoing instability in the region and the challenges posed by cross-border insurgents.Security forces conducted 19 counterterrorism operations in November, killing 53 terrorists. Most of these operations were concentrated in KP and Balochistan, the epicenters of recent violence.The PIPS report paints a grim picture of Pakistan's security landscape, with 98 conflict-related incidents causing 338 deaths and 411 injuries in November alone. Experts suggest that the evolving nature of terror threats, including the increasing lethality of BLA operations and persistent sectarian tensions, requires urgent and innovative policy responses.As Pakistan grapples with these challenges, the question remains: can the state adapt quickly enough to address the multifaceted threats destabilizing the country?","Pakistan witnessed a sharp rise in terror attacks in November, with 61 incidents marking a 27% increase from the previous month.

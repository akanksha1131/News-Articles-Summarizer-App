Border inspectors accused of aiding traffickers at America’s busiest land crossing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/border-inspectors-accused-of-aiding-traffickers-at-americas-busiest-land-crossing/articleshow/120030062.cms,"Two US customs and border protection officers have been charged with accepting thousands of dollars in bribes to allow undocumented migrants into the United States without proper checks.Farlis Almonte and Ricardo Rodriguez were both stationed at the country’s busiest land crossing, assigned to immigration inspection booths at the San Ysidro Port of Entry in Southern California. The officers allegedly worked with human traffickers in Mexico to illegally wave through vehicles packed with undocumented individuals, according to federal prosecutors.The duo was charged after investigators uncovered text messages between the officers and known traffickers, alongside unexplained cash deposits into their personal bank accounts. Surveillance footage showed at least one instance where a vehicle carrying two people was stopped, but only the driver was recorded as entering the country.Prosecutors claimed that both officers accepted thousands of dollars per vehicle they let through. Over time, the pair are believed to have helped dozens of migrants cross into the US without documentation, CBS news reported.The charges stem from an investigation that began last year after three arrested migrant smugglers named Almonte and Rodriguez as collaborators. While Almonte was in custody, investigators reportedly seized nearly $70,000 in cash they believe his partner was attempting to move into Tijuana. He could now face additional charges for money laundering and obstruction of justice.Ricardo Rodriguez’s lawyer, Michael Hawkins, said the case was still in its early stages and reminded the public that his client remains innocent until proven guilty.“We look forward to working through the current situation,” Hawkins said in an email, describing Rodriguez as “hardworking and loyal”.It is yet unclear if Almonte has an attorney to represent him.Acting US attorney Andrew Haden condemned the alleged actions, “any customs and border protection agent who aids or turns a blind eye to smugglers bringing undocumented immigrants into the US is betraying their oath and endangering our national security.”This case marks the latest in a string of corruption scandals involving border officers in the San Diego area. Over the past two years, five officers have faced similar charges.In another case last year, former inspector Leonard Darnell George was sentenced to 23 years in prison after accepting bribes to allow undocumented migrants and drug-laden vehicles through the same San Ysidro crossing.",Farlis Almonte and Ricardo Rodriguez were both stationed at the San Ysidro Port of Entry in Southern California.

Poll In your opinion, how effective is public criticism from leaders like Zelenskyy? Not effective Somewhat effective Very effective

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy launched a scathing attack on US, calling it a ""strong"" country that reacts weakly to Russia's assault.Zelenskyy's statement came after Moscow's missile strike in Ukraine that killed 18 people, including nine children, in his hometown of Kryvyi Rih.The attack occurred on Friday when a Russian ballistic missile struck a residential neighbourhood in the central Ukrainian city. According to Zelenskyy, 62 people were injured in the strike.Taking to social media on Saturday, Zelenskyy expressed his disappointment with the US Embassy's reaction. ""Such a strong country, such a strong people -- and such a weak reaction,"" he wrote. ""They are even afraid to say the word 'Russian' when talking about the missile that killed the children.""US ambassador Bridget Brink had posted on X shortly after the attack, before the full casualty toll was known. ""Horrified that tonight a ballistic missile struck near a playground and restaurant in (Kryvyi Rig). More than 50 people injured and 16 killed, including 6 children. This is why the war must end.""Brink's statement did not mention Russia by name, drawing criticism from social media users and prompting Zelenskyy's rebuke. Many online commenters questioned why the embassy failed to attribute the attack to Moscow.Brink, who was appointed by former President Joe Biden and has served as ambassador since May 2022, has in recent weeks avoided directly naming Russia in her public comments on attacks in Ukraine. This marks a shift from her earlier messaging, which regularly called out Moscow for its aggression.","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy takes to social media to criticise the US.

Israel detains two UK Labour MPs Yuan Yang and Abtisam Mohamed over alleged plan to 'spread anti-Israel hatred',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/israel-detains-two-uk-labour-mps-over-alleged-plan-to-spread-anti-israel-hatred/articleshow/120029071.cms,"(Photo: X)

Two British female MPs from the Labour Party were detained and denied entry by Israeli authorities on Saturday, accused of spreading anti-Israel rhetoric and attempting to document the activities of security forces, sparking a diplomatic row between London and Tel Aviv.The MPs, Yuan Yang and Abtisam Mohamed, were part of an official parliamentary delegation when they flew into Israel from Luton Airport. Both were turned back shortly after arrival, with Israeli immigration authorities accusing them of intending “to document the activities of security forces and spread anti-Israel hatred,” according to a report by Sky News.The MPs have not confirmed these claims. Yang represents Earley and Woodley, while Mohamed is the MP for Sheffield Central.British foreign secretary David Lammy described the treatment of the MPs as “unacceptable, counterproductive, and deeply concerning.”“I have made clear to my counterparts in the Israeli government that this is no way to treat British parliamentarians, and we have been in contact with both MPs tonight to offer our support,” Lammy said in a statement on Saturday.He added, “The UK government’s focus remains securing a return to the ceasefire and negotiations to stop the bloodshed, free the hostages and end the conflict in Gaza.”The detention and deportation of Yang and Mohamed have raised fresh questions about Israel’s stance towards foreign lawmakers, especially amid ongoing criticism of its military actions in Gaza.Israeli forces resumed full-scale operations last month following the collapse of a brief truce with Hamas. Since then, the health ministry in Gaza says at least 1,249 people have been killed in renewed strikes. This brings the total number of Palestinian deaths since the conflict began to over 50,000.The war began after Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, 2023, killing 1,218 people, mostly civilians, according to official Israeli figures reported by AFP.The exact reason for the MPs’ visit is still unclear, but Israeli officials said the two planned to watch and film security forces.","Two female MPs from the Labour Party were denied entry to Israel on Saturday.

16 dead as tornadoes and flash floods batter South and Midwest United States,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/16-dead-as-tornadoes-and-flash-floods-batter-south-and-midwest-united-states/articleshow/120028974.cms,"AP photo

LIVE: Tornado Watch issued for much of Southeast Texas until 9 p.m.

Heavy rainfall and flash flooding struck the South and Midwest on Saturday, affecting regions already saturated from previous severe storms and tornadoes, bringing the death toll to 16 and causing extensive damage to infrastructure.Continuous downpours across the central United States have led to rapid water level increases and multiple flash flood emergencies from Texas to Ohio. The National Weather Service anticipated numerous locations across multiple states would reach ""major flood stage,"" potentially causing substantial damage to infrastructure.Since Wednesday, rainfall exceeded 12 inches (30.5 centimetres) in parts of Kentucky and 8 inches (20 centimetres) in Arkansas and Missouri regions. Weather experts attributed the conditions to warm temperatures, atmospheric instability, wind shear and Gulf moisture.In Louisville, Mayor Craig Greenberg reported the Ohio River rose 5 feet (about 1.5 metres) within 24 hours. Flash flood warnings persisted across Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee and Kentucky. Kentucky faced widespread road closures due to floods and debris.Hopkinsville, Kentucky, experienced temporary relief as floodwaters receded. Falmouth, a town of 2,000 residents, faced mandatory evacuation due to the rising Licking River. Arkansas officials urged residents to limit travel, while BNSF Railway reported a bridge washout in Mammoth Spring.The death toll from weather-related incidents has reached 16, including 10 in Tennessee. In Missouri, a 57-year-old man perished after exiting a vehicle swept off the road. Kentucky reported two casualties: a 9-year-old boy and a 74-year-old person found in a submerged vehicle. In Little Rock, Arkansas, a 5-year-old died in a weather-related incident. Earlier tornadoes caused seven fatalities and destroyed neighbourhoods.According to AccuWeather's chief meteorologist Jonathan Porter, the extensive flooding near major cargo centres in Louisville, Kentucky, and Memphis could disrupt shipping operations.Nearly half of NWS forecast offices currently face 20% vacancy rates following Trump administration cuts, double the rate from ten years ago.Experts indicated that river levels would continue to rise for several days.","Heavy rainfall and flash flooding struck the South and Midwest on Saturday, affecting regions already saturated from previous severe storms and tornadoes.

Trump administration pushes back against court order to return man mistakenly deported to El Salvador,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-administration-pushes-back-against-court-order-to-return-man-mistakenly-deported-to-el-salvador/articleshow/120029021.cms,"In this undated photo provided by the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, a man identified by Jennifer Vasquez Sura as her husband, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, is led by force by guards through the Terrorism Confinement Center in Tecoluca, El Salvador. (AP photo)

The Trump administration has asked a federal appeals court to halt a judge’s order that directed the US government to return a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador — a country where he now sits in a notorious prison. The US Justice Department argued Saturday that the judiciary lacks the authority to compel the executive branch to engage with foreign governments in such matters.“A judicial order that forces the Executive to engage with a foreign power in a certain way, let alone compel a certain action by a foreign sovereign, is constitutionally intolerable,” the administration said in a filing to the 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals.The filing came a day after US District Judge Paula Xinis ordered the administration to “facilitate and effectuate” the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia by Monday night. The appeals court has asked Abrego Garcia’s attorneys to respond by Sunday.Abrego Garcia, a 29-year-old Salvadoran national, was wrongly deported last month despite a 2019 immigration judge’s ruling protecting him from removal. He now remains detained in a prison in El Salvador known for severe human rights violations . The White House described the deportation as an “administrative error.”Justice Department attorney Erez Reuveni, who admitted in court on Friday that Abrego Garcia’s deportation was a mistake, has since been placed on leave. “At my direction, every Department of Justice attorney is required to zealously advocate on behalf of the United States. Any attorney who fails to abide by this direction will face consequences,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement.During the hearing, Reuveni told the judge, “I’m also frustrated that I have no answers for you for a lot of these questions,” and could not clarify the legal basis for Abrego Garcia’s arrest.Judge Xinis, appointed by former President Barack Obama, ruled there was no legal justification for Abrego Garcia’s arrest or removal. His attorney, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, criticised the government’s inaction, saying: “Plenty of tweets. Plenty of White House press conferences. But no actual steps taken with the government of El Salvador to make it right.”The White House has insisted Abrego Garcia is affiliated with the MS-13 gang, a claim his lawyers deny, asserting there is no evidence supporting that accusation. They maintain that Abrego Garcia had legal work authorization in the US , was employed as a sheet metal apprentice, and lived with his US citizen wife. He originally fled El Salvador in 2011 due to threats from gangs.In its filing, the Justice Department claimed it has no power to compel El Salvador to return Abrego Garcia, comparing the court order to demands for resolving international conflicts: “It is an injunction to force a foreign sovereign to send back a foreign terrorist within three days’ time. That is no way to run a government. And it has no basis in American law.”","Kilmar Abrego Garcia, 29, was wrongly deported last month despite a 2019 immigration judge’s ruling protecting him from removal.

'Pros and cons'

PARIS: Mel May only realised she was different while reading a news article one day.""Wait, what? Some people hear a voice in their head?"" she thought at the time.She was stunned to discover that this was not just a figure of speech -- her friends were actually chatting to themselves in their minds.May, a 30-year-old Australian video producer who lives in New York, remembers trying to explain to her family: ""I don't have a voice in my head.""""My dad was like, 'You are lying',"" she told AFP.But her father came around once May started working with psychologists who agreed -- she is one of the very rare people who lack inner speech.The idea that some people might not experience this phenomenon is so new that a clinical name, anendophasia , was only proposed for it in a paper last year.The inner monologue has proven extremely difficult to study because it relies on people being able to describe how they think -- and it turns out we are unreliable narrators.""People are ignorant about the characteristics of their own inner experience,"" Russell Hurlburt, a psychology professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, told AFP.""And it doesn't matter how confident you are,"" added Hurlburt, a pioneer in the field who has studied people with a range of inner experiences, including May.Most people assume their inner voice is speaking all the time but it is actually just one of several phenomena of our inner experience, Hurlburt said.Others include visual imagery, ""unsymbolised thinking"", feelings and sensory awareness.To study these phenomena, Hurlburt conducted research that would have a beeper go off at random while study participants were reading Franz Kafka's ""The Metamorphosis"" and describe what was in their head.Rather than speaking the words in their inner voice, they were actually creating visual images -- ""their own video"" -- of the book, he said.People also have different kinds of inner speech. Some have multiple voices, while bilingual people can switch languages.Giordon Stark, a California-based particle physicist who was born deaf, has a mix of inner speech and visual images.""I don't think of the word 'bed' in my head but I rather visualise the idea of my head hitting the pillow,"" which is similar to the sign language gesture for the word, the 34-year-old told AFP.Pressed to estimate how often people are hearing an inner voice, Hurlburt emphasised that much more research is needed on the subject.But a ballpark figure could be that people are ""inner speaking"" 20 to 25 percent of the time, he said.That average includes people who have far more frequent speech and those with none, such as May.""Her inner experience is close to being nothing but she's the exception rather than the rule,"" Hurlburt said.Helene Loevenbruck, a leading inner voice researcher at France's Universite Grenoble Alpes, has had to change her mind on whether people like May could even exist.""I thought everyone had an inner voice until very recently,"" she told AFP.The idea ran counter to her previous work, which suggested inner speech was an important part of speaking out loud, serving as an ""internal simulation"".But the work of Hurlburt -- and the discovery that some people cannot create mental images, a condition called aphantasia -- changed her mind.May believes her lack of an inner voice is why she has never been an anxious person -- and why meditation is very easy for her.Daniel Gregory, a philosopher specialising in inner speech at the University of Barcelona, said a potential disadvantage of having more inner speech is ""a vulnerability to negative thought patterns, to rumination"".But we can also ""use inner speech to encourage ourselves, to give ourselves positive messages"", he told AFP.May said a common response to hearing that she has no inner monologue is: ""Wow, that must be amazing.""""I'm really quick to push back on that because I think certainly there are pros and cons,"" she said.""I reflect a lot about what aspects of the lived experience I'm missing out on.""As well as not stressing about the future, May has a hard time remembering the past.Loevenbruck said the people she had studied with aphantasia reported having ""weird"" autobiographical memories ""because they have no sensory way of reliving a memory"".May emphasised that lacking an inner voice did not mean she was incapable of thought.""I'm not dead inside. I know stuff and I feel stuff,"" said May, who plans to make a documentary about her experience.Asked what was running through her head, she responded simply.""Well, I'm sitting here, I'm listening to you and then I just automatically respond. And that's it.""Isn't that how this happens for everyone?""","Mel May is one of the very rare people who lack inner speech.

Lawyers advise Canadians to keep a burner phone

Canada has again updated its travel advisory for the United States, including a warning to prospective travelers that they should be prepared for scrutiny from border patrol officers. The updated advisory says US authorities can check electronic devices like phones and laptops. ""Comply and be forthcoming in all interactions with border authorities. If you are denied entry. you could be detained while awaiting deportation,"" the new advice read.This is the second major update of Canada's travel rules for the US. The first came as the US made it mandatory for all Canadians staying in the US for more than 30 days to register with the US administration. This new rule is effective from April 11.The mandatory registration rules come from an executive order issued by President Donald Trump on his first day in office, directing the Department of Homeland Security to ensure non-citizens comply with the Immigration and Nationality Act. The law requires “all aliens 14 years of age or older who were not registered and fingerprinted (if required) when applying for a US visa and who remain in the United States for 30 days or longer” to do so, according to the USCIS website. Parents and legal guardians of children under 14 must make sure they are registered.Canada issued a warning about the stricter border checks before the new rule took effect.""Individual border agents often have significant discretion in making those determinations. US authorities strictly enforce entry requirements. Expect scrutiny at ports of entry, including of electronic devices. Comply and be forthcoming in all interactions with border authorities. If you are denied entry, you could be detained while awaiting deportation,"" the new update said. ""We have obtained the information on this page from the US authorities. It can, however, change at any time.""Amid the deteriorating relationships between the US and Canada that increased checks onthe US-Canada border, Canadian actress Jasmine Mooney was detained by ICE and was kept in ICE custody for 12 days. She said she went to the border to renew her visa but was detained instead, though she told the officials that she did not mean to enter the country illegally.As immigration officials are entitled to confiscate phones and laptops and check social media accounts of individuals entering the US, lawyers in Canada advised that Canadians should keep a burner phone with them while traveling to the US and keep their original phone at home.","Canada updates its US travel advisory, warns travelers that they should expect scrutiny at the border.

"Elon Musk's Doge falsely brands feminine hygiene research as transgender study, cancels $600,000 grant",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/elon-musks-doge-falsely-brands-hygiene-research-as-transgender-study-cancels-600000-grant/articleshow/120029655.cms,"Elon Musk (L), Representative AI image by Denny (R)

A $600,000 federal grant awarded to Southern University for researching sustainable feminine hygiene products has been abruptly canceled after US officials misrepresented it as a study on "" menstrual cycles in transgender men ."" The misinformation, amplified by the Department of Government Efficiency ( Doge ) on its website and on X, has triggered safety fears for the lead researcher and backlash from the scientific and farming communities.The grant, titled Project Farm to Feminine Hygiene, was designed to explore alternatives to synthetic menstrual products using natural fibers like regenerative cotton. It also included educational outreach for women and girls and plans to establish a local fiber-processing facility.But Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins revoked the funding last month, incorrectly framing the project as focused on transgender menstruation. “The real loss is for women,” said Sharon Donnan, founder of Acadian Brown Cotton, a key partner in the project. “It makes me so angry that I want to start calling names.”Doge , led by President Donald Trump ’s advisor Elon Musk, is spearheading sweeping cost-cutting efforts across the federal government. While the department claims to be eliminating wasteful spending, critics say it's increasingly targeting programs based on distorted or outright false narratives.“This was just one more senseless, hateful cancellation,” said a representative of Acadian Brown Cotton, who requested anonymity due to safety concernsAccording to the US Department of Agriculture and five sources interviewed by AFP, the grant mentioned the word “transgender” only once—in a single line acknowledging that some transgender men may menstruate. Southern University issued a statement clarifying that the project “was not a study on or including research on menstrual cycles.”Despite that, Rollins repeated the false narrative during a White House Cabinet meeting, while Doge promoted it online. The misleading claim fueled online outrage so intense that the project’s lead researcher, Samii Kennedy Benson, feared for her safety, sources said.""This grant would have expanded the market,” said a cotton farmer who contributed to the study. “It's kind of sad it got cut off in the middle.”Southern University, a historically Black college, also aimed to support local cotton growers in Louisiana—one of the nation’s poorest states. Norris Green Jr., a Black farmer excited to contribute to the project, urged federal officials to witness the impact of their decisions firsthand. “Come to the Gulf and see how many of these females are impoverished,” he said. “You might have a different perspective.”The incident is part of a broader pattern tied to Doge ’s controversial agenda. The agency has come under scrutiny for spreading falsehoods about various federal programs—ranging from fabricated claims about government-funded transgender mice to condoms supposedly sent to war-torn Gaza.""Most factual information about Doge either never makes it in front of the people who need it most or is received with hostility,"" said Audrey McCabe, an analyst with the nonprofit Common Cause. “Once a falsehood infiltrates public consciousness, an investigation correcting the lie can only do so much to cancel it out.”Doge 's website, which promotes its cost-saving efforts, has been flagged by media reports as being riddled with inaccuracies. Despite mounting criticism, officials have continued to promote dubious narratives—many of which receive millions of views online.The Biden administration has not commented on the specific cancellation, and Benson has not responded to interview requests.","$600,000 federal grant awarded to Southern University for researching sustainable feminine hygiene products has been abruptly canceled.

A protestor dressed as Pikachu was spotted in the crowds as a surge of protests erupted across the US on Saturday after thousands of demonstrators filled the streets across all 50 states to voice their opposition to President Donald Trump and his key adviser Elon Musk.The coordinated wave of over 1,200 “Hands Off!” rallies united a broad coalition — including civil rights groups , labor unions, LGBTQ+ advocates, veterans, and other community organizations — in pushing back against the administration’s drastic cuts to public services , government downsizing, and contentious social policy shifts.The administration is facing fierce backlash from critics who say it’s dismantling the foundations of American democracy. ""They’ve woken up a sleeping giant, and they haven’t seen nothing yet,"" declared activist Graylan Hagler during a protest in Washington, D.C., as reported by AFP.Elon Musk — the billionaire head of Tesla, SpaceX, and social platform X — is at the center of the storm as the newly appointed chief of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a role that has seen him push sweeping budget cuts across federal institutions.While Musk insists the reforms are saving taxpayers billions, many see them as a dangerous erosion of vital public services. Protesters, according to the Associated Press, condemned the closure of Social Security offices, large-scale layoffs of federal employees, and looming reductions in healthcare and HIV-related programs.At the Washington rally, Kelley Robinson, president of the Human Rights Campaign, slammed the administration’s rollback of LGBTQ+ protections: “They’re trying to ban our books, they’re slashing HIV prevention funding, they’re criminalizing our doctors, our teachers, our families and our lives,” she said.These frustrations resonated across the country.

A shocking incident at a West Virginia cemetery has led to the arrest of a gravedigger after he allegedly desecrated the remains of an infant buried more than four decades ago. Authorities say the man carelessly disposed of the child’s casket, leading to the remains being flung from the coffin.The disturbing episode unfolded on March 27 at Baylous Cemetery in Salt Rock, where 49-year-old Matthew Fortner was digging a grave for a new burial plot. During the process, he allegedly struck and unearthed a small casket interred in 1982, according to the Cabell County Sheriff ’s Office.Rather than treating the discovery with the respect and care required, officials say Fortner heartlessly tossed the casket down a nearby hillside. As it tumbled down the slope, the lid flew open, sending the skeletal remains of the baby into the air.The horrifying scene was witnessed by a couple who were visitinUg the cemetery to decorate graves ahead of Easter. Disturbed by what they saw, they promptly notified local authorities.“It takes a sick individual, in my opinion, to desecrate a grave and mess with a corpse — period,” said Cabell County Sheriff Doug Adams, expressing disgust over the act.Fortner was arrested on April 3 and is now facing several charges, including disinterment or displacement of a dead body, damaging cemetery property, and violating laws protecting human skeletal remains. He is currently being held on a $105,000 bond and, if convicted, could face up to five years in prison.Sheriff’s officials emphasized that only one grave — that of the infant, believed to be just a few months old at the time of burial — appeared to have been disturbed. The identity of the child has not been disclosed.“We do think this is an isolated incident. We don’t think this is going to be a trend or anything,” Sheriff Adams reassured the public.Following the incident, the child’s remains were transported to the State Medical Examiner’s Office in Charleston for examination.Adding a grim dimension to the story, Fortner has a previous criminal history. In 1997, he was convicted of murder and sentenced to life with mercy two years later. He was released from prison in 2008.Authorities continue to investigate the circumstances surrounding the incident.","Matthew Fortner, 49, was digging a grave at Baylous Cemetery in Salt Rock, West Virginia, when he allegedly struck and unearthed a small casket interred in 1982.

‘MAKE A DEAL,’ Trump sends letter to Iran, issues new warning to Russia

BREAKING: Iran rejects negotiations with the US over nuclear program

Tensions between the United States and Iran escalated further Saturday after a leading Iranian state-run newspaper, closely linked to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei , published a shocking call for the assassination of US President Donald Trump.The editorial, published by the hardline Kayhan newspaper , included a chilling statement: “He’s way out of line! Any day now, in revenge for the blood of Martyr Soleimani, a few bullets are going to be fired into that empty skull of his and he’ll be drinking from the chalice of a cursed death.”The article appeared just days after Trump made a provocative statement warning of military strikes if Iran refuses to cooperate on its nuclear weapons program. “If they don't make a deal, there will be bombing,” Trump said. “But there's a chance that if they don't make a deal, that I will do secondary tariffs on them like I did four years ago.” He also confirmed, “The US and officials from the Islamic Republic are talking.”Trump’s remarks appear to have provoked Kayhan, often regarded as a mouthpiece for the supreme leader. The paper wrote, “He makes threats and then backs down! The result? The situation in America gets worse by the day. Just yesterday, it was announced that his actions have caused $3 trillion in damage to the US economy, American exports are facing serious problems, and top officials in the military, CIA, and elsewhere have either resigned or been dismissed.”Iranian-born Israeli analyst Beni Sabti, a fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies, warned that Iran’s regime is trying to stoke global animosity toward Trump. “[They] want to unite the world against Trump and wants someone to shoot Trump, and also they want to bring the economic issue against him,” he said. Sabti likened the regime's rhetoric to the 2022 stabbing of author Salman Rushdie in New York, saying the current climate is fueled by the same dangerous propaganda. “It is very good opportunity for the Trump administration to file a complaint with United Nations Security Council,” he added.The inflammatory language in Kayhan follows years of threats from Iran’s regime in retaliation for the 2020 US drone strike that killed Qassem Soleimani , a top general in Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps . At the time, Trump ordered the strike citing Soleimani’s role in orchestrating the deaths of over 600 American troops. Since then, Iranian officials have promised vengeance, including potential plots to kill Trump and members of his administration.Jason Brodsky, policy director at United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI), noted that Kayhan has consistently advocated for Trump’s assassination. “Kayhan has repeatedly threatened to assassinate President Trump for years. Kayhan’s editor Hossein Shariatmadari is a personal representative of Iran’s supreme leader,” he told Fox News.Brodsky further stressed, “Such threats ring hollow the demands of Iranian officials for there to be ‘mutual respect’ during future negotiations with the United States.” He added that the threats align with past Iranian attempts to assassinate US figures and should disqualify any diplomatic overtures from the regime. “The Trump administration should make clear that there can be no negotiations while Iran’s regime is threatening and plotting to kill American citizens.”Brodsky also called on the US to impose sanctions on Kayhan and its editor, stating, “The US should also sanction Hossein Shariatmadari and Kayhan. The US Treasury Department previously designated Iranian media networks like PressTV and Tasnim. It should do so with Kayhan as well. Canada has already sanctioned Kayhan given its record of threats.”Just months ago, the US Justice Department revealed it had disrupted a plot orchestrated by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps aimed at assassinating Trump. A federal court filing detailed how a 51-year-old Iranian national, Farhad Shakeri, was tasked in September with surveilling and potentially killing the US president.The threats from Iran have not only been verbal. In a disturbing escalation, Iranian state media even released an animated video depicting Trump’s assassination. The video, reportedly uploaded to a website linked to Khamenei himself, simulated a targeted strike on Trump in what was widely interpreted as state-sponsored incitement.While Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian has publicly stated that Iran is open to dialogue, “We don’t avoid talks; it’s the breach of promises that has caused issues for us so far,” he told the Associated Press. He insisted that trust must be rebuilt before talks can resume: “They must prove that they can build trust.”Even so, Pezeshkian acknowledged that some level of indirect contact with the Trump administration is ongoing. The White House and US State Department have not publicly responded to the renewed threats or diplomatic gestures as of yet.As the rhetoric intensifies, observers warn that Iran’s blend of violent threats, state propaganda, and aggressive nuclear posturing could lead to even more instability in the region—and could derail any remaining hopes for negotiation.","The editorial, published by the hardline Kayhan newspaper, included a chilling statement: “He’s way out of line!

US President Donald Trump on Saturday shared a clip praising his move on tariffs and intent behind the stock market crash.In the clip, it was claimed that Trump has been playing a ""secret game"" to make Americans rich.""Trump is crashing the stock market by 20% this month, but he is doing it on purpose.

As part of his aggressive trade policy, Trump imposed steep tariffs on key imports, reigniting fears of a full-blown trade war. These measures, aimed at pressuring foreign governments, particularly China, have rattled investor confidence, leading to sharp declines in major indices.Businesses dependent on international supply chains are facing rising costs, while consumers may soon feel the pinch through increased prices on everyday goods.

Chevron ordered to pay more than $740 million to restore Louisiana coast in landmark trial,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/chevron-ordered-to-pay-more-than-740-million-to-restore-louisiana-coast-in-landmark-trial/articleshow/120028660.cms,"What did Chevron do wrong?

How are oil companies contributing to Louisiana's land loss?

What does this mean for future litigation against oil companies?

POINTE A LA HACHE: Oil company Chevron must pay more than $740 million to restore damage it caused to southeast Louisiana's coastal wetlands, a jury ruled on Friday following a landmark trial more than a decade in the making. The case was the first of dozens of pending lawsuits to reach trial in Louisiana against the world's leading oil companies for their role in accelerating land loss along the state's rapidly disappearing coast. The verdict - which Chevron says it will appeal - could set a precedent leaving other oil and gas firms on the hook for billions of dollars in damages tied to land loss and environmental degradation.Jurors found that energy giant Texaco, acquired by Chevron in 2001, had for decades violated Louisiana regulations governing coastal resources by failing to restore wetlands impacted by dredging canals, drilling wells and billions of gallons of wastewater dumped into the marsh.""No company is big enough to ignore the law, no company is big enough to walk away scot-free,"" the plaintiff's lead attorney John Carmouche told jurors during closing arguments.A 1978 Louisiana coastal management law mandated that sites used by oil companies ""be cleared, revegetated, detoxified, and otherwise restored as near as practicable to their original condition"" after operations ended. Older operations sites that continued to be used were not exempt and companies were expected to apply for proper permits.But the oil company did not obtain proper permits and failed to clean up its mess, leading to contamination from wastewater stored unsafely or dumped directly into the marsh, the lawsuit said.The company also failed to follow known best practices for decades since it began operating in the area in the 1940s, expert witnesses for the plaintiff's testified. The company ""chose profits over the marsh"" and allowed the environmental degradation caused by its operations to fester and spread, Carmouche said.The jury awarded $575 million to compensate for land loss, $161 million to compensate for contamination and $8.6 million for abandoned equipment - a total of $744.6 million. The amount earmarked for restoration exceeds $1.1 billion when including interest, according to attorneys for Talbot, Carmouche & Marcello, the firm behind the lawsuit.Plaquemines Parish, the southeast Louisiana district which brought the lawsuit, had asked for $2.6 billion in damages.Chevron's lead trial attorney Mike Phillips said in a statement following the verdict that ""Chevron is not the cause of the land loss occurring"" in Plaquemines Parish and that the law does not apply to ""conduct that occurred decades before the law was enacted.""Phillips called the ruling ""unjust"" and said there were ""numerous legal errors.""The lawsuit against Chevron was filed in 2013 by Plaquemines Parish, a rural district in Louisiana straddling the final leg of the Mississippi River heading into the Gulf of Mexico, also referred to as the Gulf of America as declared by President Donald Trump.Louisiana's coastal parishes have lost more than 2,000 square miles (5,180 square kilometers) of land over the past century, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, which has also identified oil and gas infrastructure as a significant cause. The state could lose another 3,000 square miles (7,770 square kilometers) in the coming decades, its coastal protection agency has warned.Thousands of miles of canals cut through the wetlands by oil companies weakens them and exacerbates the impacts of sea level rise. Industrial wastewater from oil production degrades the surrounding soil and vegetation. The torn up wetlands leave South Louisiana - home to some of the nation's biggest ports and key energy sector infrastructure -- more vulnerable to flooding and destruction from extreme weather events like hurricanes.Phillips, Chevron's attorney, said the company had operated lawfully and blamed land loss in Louisiana on other factors, namely the extensive levee system that blocks the Mississippi River from depositing land regenerating sediment - a widely acknowledged cause of coastal erosion.The way to solve the land loss problem is ""not suing oil companies, it's reconnecting the Mississippi River with the delta,"" Phillips said during closing arguments.Yet the lawsuit held the company responsible for exacerbating and accelerating land loss in Louisiana, rather than being its sole cause.Chevron also challenged the costly wetlands restoration project proposed by the parish, which involved removing large amounts of contaminated soil and filling in the swaths fragmented wetlands eroded over the past century. The company said the plan was impractical and designed to inflate the damages rather than lead to real world implementation.Attorney Jimmy Faircloth, Jr., who represented the state of Louisiana, which has backed Plaquemines and other local governments in their lawsuits against oil companies, told jurors from the parish that Chevron was telling them their community was not worth preserving.""Our communities are built on coast, our families raised on coast, our children go to school on coast,"" Faircloth said. ""The state of Louisiana will not surrender the coast, it's for the good of the state that the coast be maintained.""Carmouche, a well-connected attorney, and his firm have been responsible for bringing many of the lawsuits against oil companies in the state. Industry groups have accused the firm of seeking big paydays, not coastal restoration.Louisiana's economy has long been heavily dependent on the oil and gas industry and the industry holds significant political power. Even so, Louisiana's staunchly pro-industry Gov. Jeff Landry has supported the lawsuits, including bringing the state on board during his tenure as Attorney General.Oil companies have fought tooth and nail to quash the litigation, including unsuccessfully lobbying Louisiana's Legislature to pass a law to invalidate the claims. Chevron and other firms also repeatedly tried to move the lawsuits into federal court where they believed they would find a more sympathetic audience.But the heavy price Chevron is set to pay could hasten other firms to seek settlements in the dozens of other lawsuits across Louisiana. Plaquemines alone has 20 other cases pending against oil companies.The state is running out of money to support its ambitious coastal restoration plans, which have been fueled by soon-expiring settlement funds from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, and supporters of the litigation say payouts could provide a much-needed injection of funds.Tommy Faucheux , president of the Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil & Gas Association, said the verdict against Chevron ""undermines Louisiana's position as an energy leader"" and ""threatens our country's trajectory to America-first energy dominance across the globe."" He warned that ""businesses here are at risk of being sued retroactively tomorrow for following the laws of today.""Attorneys for the parish said they hope that big payout will prompt more oil companies to come to the table to negotiate and channel more funding towards coastal restoration.""We continue to fight to restore the coast,"" said Don Carmouche, an attorney with the firm representing the parish and other local governments which have filed suit. ""All the parishes want is for the companies to come together for reasonable restoration of the coast.""",Chevron must pay more than $740 million to restore damage it caused to southeast Louisiana's coastal wetlands.

LA County reaches $4 billion agreement to settle sexual abuse claims at juvenile facilities,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/la-county-reaches-4-billion-agreement-to-settle-sexual-abuse-claims-at-juvenile-facilities/articleshow/120028616.cms,"LOS ANGELES: Los Angeles County has reached a $4 billion agreement to settle nearly 7,000 claims of sexual abuse in juvenile facilities since 1959, officials said Friday.The agreement, which still needs approval from the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, far surpasses a $2.6 billion settlement reached in 2022 with Boy Scouts of America that was the largest aggregate sexual abuse settlement in U.S. history at the time.""On behalf of the County, I apologize wholeheartedly to everyone who was harmed by these reprehensible acts,"" Fesia Davenport, the county's chief executive, said in a statement.The agreement would settle lawsuits filed by thousands of people who alleged they were mistreated and sexually abused in foster care and juvenile detention facilities in Los Angeles County. The plaintiffs were able to sue because of a California law that took effect in 2020 and suspended the statute of limitations for childhood sex abuse victims to bring cases for three years.Many of the claims involved the MacLaren Children's Center, which was closed in 2003. The facility, which was intended to be a safe space for children awaiting placement in foster homes, opened in 1961 and was overseen by probation officials until it was placed under the county's Department of Children and Family Services in 1976.One man said he was sexually abused by a physician at the facility when he was 8 years old, while another said he was assaulted by a male staff member in a bathroom when he was 5. Children were routinely placed in solitary confinement, drugged and restrained in chairs at the facility, according to court papers filed by plaintiffs.""It is bittersweet for the survivors, because nothing is ever going to take away what was done to them, and how badly their lives were altered and how much they have suffered,"" said Adam Slater, one of the plaintiffs' attorneys. ""However, the settlement hopefully gives them some measure of justice and provides them with some measure of closure.""Other private and public entities have been rocked by allegations of wide-ranging abuse and subsequent settlements.The 2022 settlement by Boy Scouts of America, which recently renamed itself Scouting America, involved more than 80,000 men who said they were molested as children by scouting leaders and others.And last year the Archdiocese of Los Angeles agreed to pay $800 million to victims of clergy sexual abuse, bringing the total payout to more than $1.5 billion.Disclosure of the massive tentative payout by Los Angeles County comes at a time when the nation's largest county - home to about 10 million residents - is facing a tightening bind of financial obligations on its $49 billion annual budget. Officials fear hundreds of millions of dollars for public services could vanish in Trump administration cutbacks, while the county has seen additional costs from January's historic wildfires as it also deals with an ongoing homeless crisis.Davenport recently said the county is facing a ""large amount of uncertainty"" with its budget - some agencies are largely funded by federal dollars.The proposed agreement includes creating a countywide hotline for reporting child sexual abuse allegations against employees and developing a system to expedite investigations, officials said.""By balancing justice for the victims with a commitment to reform, this resolution ensures both acknowledgment of past wrongs and a pathway to a safer, more accountable future,"" Patrick McNicholas, one of the plaintiffs' attorneys, said in a statement.The county's claims board will consider the proposed settlement Monday. If approved, it would be considered by the Board of Supervisors on April 29.","Los Angeles County has reached a $4 billion agreement to settle nearly 7,000 claims of sexual abuse in juvenile facilities since 1959.

In a move that could deepen tensions between Washington and Juba, the United States has revoked all visas held by South Sudanese passport holders. The decision, announced Saturday, comes in response to South Sudan’s refusal to accept the return of its citizens who are being repatriated from the USSecretary of State Marco Rubio said the decision takes effect immediately. “Effective immediately, the United States Department of State is taking actions to revoke all visas held by South Sudanese passport holders and prevent further issuance to prevent entry into the United States by South Sudanese passport holders,” Rubio said.Rubio emphasized the US stance that “every country must accept the return of its citizens in a timely manner when another country, including the US, seeks to remove them.” He added, “We will be prepared to review these actions when South Sudan is in full cooperation.”The secretary also criticized South Sudan’s transitional authorities, stating: “It is time for South Sudan’s transitional government to stop taking advantage of the United States.”The South Sudanese embassy in Washington has yet to comment on the visa revocations.The visa sanctions come as tensions rise within South Sudan’s borders. This past week, African Union mediators arrived in the capital, Juba, to launch crisis talks aimed at preventing another outbreak of civil war. The nation has been on edge following the recent house arrest of First Vice President Riek Machar.President Salva Kiir’s administration has accused Machar of attempting to incite rebellion, reigniting fears of a return to widespread violence. Machar, a longtime political rival of Kiir, led opposition forces during the brutal civil conflict between 2013 and 2018—a war largely fought along ethnic lines that claimed hundreds of thousands of lives.The conflict pitted fighters from the Dinka ethnic group, Kiir’s base, against those from the Nuer group, aligned with Machar. Though recent violence in Upper Nile state has involved the White Army militia—historically allied with Machar—his camp denies any current association with the group.The Trump administration, under which Rubio currently serves as Secretary of State, has taken a hardline stance on immigration enforcement. Part of its policy has been to penalize countries that fail to cooperate with deportation procedures, with consequences ranging from visa suspensions to potential tariffs.Saturday’s move represents one of the most sweeping visa actions taken against an African nation during this administration, and it comes at a time when many observers worry that South Sudan could slide back into conflict.",The move comes in response to South Sudan’s refusal to accept the return of its citizens who are being repatriated from the US.

Fort Bend County Judge K P George, a prominent Indian-American Democrat who has held office since 2018, was arrested Friday on two felony counts of money laundering . The charges stem from allegations of wire fraud and falsifying a campaign finance report , with potential prison time of up to 10 years if convicted.Court documents and statements from the Fort Bend County District Attorney 's Office allege George laundered an amount between USD 30,000 and USD 150,000. He was booked into the county jail around 3:30 p.m. and released shortly after, having posted USD 20,000 in bail.The District Attorney's Office claimed that the charges announced Friday are separate from an earlier case. In 2023, George and his former chief of staff, Taral Patel, were indicted over accusations that they created fake social media accounts to manufacture racist attacks targeting George's 2022 re-election campaign.“These charges are unrelated to the pending misdemeanour,” the DA’s office clarified. “Our office remains committed to the integrity our public deserves and the ethics to which all prosecutors are sworn.”Political fallout was swift. County Treasurer Bill Rickert urged George to resign, referencing both the 2023 scandal and the current charges. “Fake racism scandals” and the latest indictment, Rickert said, are cause for serious concern. Former Precinct 4 Constable Trever Nehls, who ran against George in 2022, also weighed in. “This indictment is not surprising. I saw during the campaign how lies and hate were used to manipulate voters,” he said.Responding to the arrest, George insisted he is innocent and framed the indictment as politically motivated. “I have full faith in the judicial system and will vigorously defend my innocence,” he said in a statement released Friday. He further accused the DA’s office of “improper treatment.”In response, the District Attorney’s Office dismissed the claim, stating the investigation was carried out in compliance with all legal and ethical obligations.The news has sent shockwaves through Fort Bend County, one of Texas’s fastest-growing and most demographically diverse regions. Political analyst Elena Martinez of the University of Houston noted that “an indictment like this, especially involving alleged financial misconduct, can severely erode public trust even before a trial.” She added that the case is likely to draw attention beyond the county line due to Fort Bend’s rising national profile.Adding to the intrigue, George's office had announced just a day prior to the arrest that his annual State of the County address, originally planned for May 8, was being postponed indefinitely. No reason was provided at the time.Authorities confirmed that the investigation is still underway.","K P George, a prominent Indian-American Democrat, was arrested Friday on two felony counts of money laundering.

Who are the militant groups?



Which are the most affected regions?



What are the consequences of the rising violence?



More than 100 deadly attacks in Pakistan by Islamist militants and separatist rebels made March the deadliest month over a decade with 335 people killed, a think tank reported Thursday.Of the deaths, 228 were caused by militant groups, according to a report by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) think tank. They included 73 members of security services, including soldiers and police officers, 67 civilians and 88 militants.The Islamist-militant Pakistani Taliban, or Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), and the separatist rebel Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) were the main militant groups responsible for the attacks.The BLA was responsible for a 28-hour hijacking of the train Jaffar Express in the southwestern region Balochistan. Some 450 people were held hostage and more than two dozen were killed.Balochistan was the most affected province, followed by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in the northwest of Pakistan.They have both also been targets of suicide bombings, a form of attacks that surged in March.In Punjab, the eastern province bordering India, the think tank observed a strong increase in militant activity.At least seven attacks were recorded, and most were attributed to the TTP.In response to the growing threat, Pakistan's security forces have intensified their operations in the region. Many people have been arrested with connections to militant groups, including the TTP.Islamabad claims that most attacks, both by militants and rebels, are planned and executed from Afghanistan. It accuses the neighboring country of granting Pakistani militants space to plan and organize attacks.A recent report by the United Nations supported this claim. It said that the Taliban provided support to the TTP and that some attacks were launched from Afghan territory.As a consequence, the Pakistani government has urged the ruling Taliban in Afghanistan to act against the allegedly responsible criminals. Kabul, on the other hand, denies that the militants are in Afghanistan.","Of the deaths, 228 were caused by militant groups, according to a report by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies.

He maintains his innocence, asserting that the charges are politically driven.","Imran Khan has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for his contributions to human rights and democratic values.

Pakistan said it killed 10 civilians during an anti-militant operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on Saturday.The operation, in Katlang, a remote hilltop area in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, was aimed at militant hideouts and resulted in the deaths of 12 suspected terrorists. However, it also led to the deaths of 10 civilians, including women and children, sparking outrage.Government spokesman Muhammad Ali Saif confirmed the casualties and said that the location was being used as a hideout and transit point for terrorists. He admitted that unarmed civilians were present at the site.""The safety of civilians is always a top priority during such operations. However, due to complex geography, terrorists using civilian populations as cover, and the urgent nature of the operation, unintended consequences can sometimes occur,"" said Saif, as quoted by the Associated Press.The provincial government has now promised an inquiry into how the operation led to civilian deaths.Local residents reported that the victims were nomads from the Swat region who had been living in the Shamozai mountains with their livestock. Their families protested by placing their bodies on the Swat Highway, demanding justice.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur called the incident “highly condemnable and tragic.” He assured that every effort is made to avoid civilian casualties but acknowledged the challenges of military operations in complex terrains where militants embed themselves among civilians.The government said medical aid is being provided to the injured, and compensation for the victims' families is being arranged.

IMF Approves $2 Billion for Pakistan Under Loan Programme | Dawn News English

Pakistan's citizens may have to pay additional taxation as a new carbon levy is anticipated following a USD 1.3 billion agreement with the IMF for climate change initiatives PTI reported citing official sources.Alongside this, the IMF agreed to release approximately USD 1 billion as the second tranche of the previously agreed USD 7 billion loan.""The IMF team has reached a SLA with the Pakistani authorities on the first review of the 37-month extended arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF), and a new 28-month arrangement under the IMF's Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) with total access over the 28 months of around USD 1.3 billion,"" the Fund said in a statement.The total IMF loan now amounts to USD 8.3 billion with this RSF arrangement. Upon approval from the IMF's Executive Board, Pakistan would receive immediate access to approximately USD 2 billion to strengthen its balance of payment position.The new agreement requires additional commitments from the tax-burdened population, including a new carbon levy, increased water rates, and liberalisation of the automobile sector. Dawn newspaper reports that a reduction in power rates is expected, funded by reallocating the existing petroleum levy.Senior officials familiar with the SLA and MEFP indicated that the prime minister would announce an approximate Rs 7 per unit reduction in average electricity rates, effective from April 1, 2025.The implementation of new measures - carbon levy, water pricing and automobile sector reforms - will commence from July 1, 2025. Fiscal consolidation will continue through reduced energy subsidies and controlled development spending.Officials confirmed that whilst the government sought GST reduction on electricity, the IMF instead permitted the use of increased petroleum levy to offset power tariffs. A Rs 10 per litre increase in petroleum levy would provide approximately Rs 1.80 per unit relief.The government has agreed to implement a carbon levy of Rs 3-5 per litre or equivalent on all hydrocarbons, including petroleum products and coal, with gradual increases planned. The revenue will fund climate-related initiatives.Automobile sector trade tariffs will decrease from 10.5% to 6% by FY 2030, ending what both parties agreed was excessive protection. These measures require cabinet approval before implementation through the finance bill 2025-26.The authorities aim to achieve an FY25 underlying primary surplus of 1% of GDP minimum, maintaining consolidation in FY26. The focus remains on revenue mobilisation, spending efficiency and tax base expansion.Pakistan has committed to maintaining strict monetary policy to keep inflation within the SBP's 5-7% target range and preserve foreign exchange market functionality while building reserves.The RSF programme includes strengthening public investment processes, improving water resource management, enhancing disaster financing coordination, addressing climate-related risks, and promoting environmental-friendly transportation to reduce pollution impacts.",IMF Approves $2 Billion for Pakistan Under Loan Programme.

Pakistani YouTube star Rajab Butt has been charged with blasphemy following the launch of his perfume named ""295"", a reference to Pakistan’s controversial blasphemy laws.The case was filed after his video promoting the fragrance sparked outrage, particularly from the hardline Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), which places blasphemy at the core of its political agenda.Butt, who boasts millions of followers online, announced the perfume in a now-deleted video, referencing Section 295 of Pakistan’s penal code, which deals with blasphemy. The move triggered widespread condemnation, with TLP leader Haider Ali Shah Gillani filing a formal complaint against him on Monday.""There are numerous sections in the penal code, but why did he choose blasphemy-related sections to name a perfume?"" Gillani was quoted by the news agency AFP, accusing Butt of attempting to ""normalise"" disrespect towards religious laws.According to AFP, the police charge sheet confirms that Butt has been charged under both blasphemy and cybercrime laws. If convicted, he faces up to 10 years in prison.As the controversy increased, Butt released an apology video on Sunday, holding a Quran as he sought forgiveness. ""I apologise for the words I uttered during the launch of the perfume,"" he said. He also announced the immediate discontinuation of the product.The controversy also relates to the late Indian rapper Sidhu Moose Wala ’s song ""295,"" which also referenced blasphemy laws. Butt had previously likened himself to Moose Wala, claiming they both faced persecution under similar legal provisions, according to Daily Pakistan.This is not Butt’s first legal battle. In January, he pleaded guilty to illegally owning a lion cub, which he had received as a wedding gift.A Pakistani court ordered him to create 12 educational videos on animal welfare as part of his punishment. He avoided jail time by pledging to use his platform to raise awareness about responsible treatment of wild animals.Blasphemy remains an extremely sensitive issue in Pakistan, where accusations, often unverified, can lead to mob violence and even killings.The legal provisions under Section 295 have been widely criticised by human rights groups for being used as a tool to target individuals, including religious minorities and public figures.","Pakistani YouTube star Rajab Butt has been charged with blasphemy following the launch of his perfume named ""295,"" a reference to Pakistan’s controversial blasphemy laws.

"For Nepal businesses, most valuable currency's stability",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/for-nepal-businesses-most-valuable-currencys-stability/articleshow/120028092.cms,"KATHMANDU: Beneath the cluttered skyline of tangled wires, scaffolds, prayer flags, and pro-monarchy banners fluttering over recent protests, entrepreneurs and business owners in Kathmandu have grown accustomed to fast-changing ministries just as they have to the valley's notoriously erratic weather.Across boardrooms, shop floors and startup hubs, one sentiment rises above the rest: political stability, regardless of who delivers it-king or elected leader-is now the most valuable currency in Nepal's economy.Since declaring itself a federal democratic republic in 2008, Nepal has cycled through 12 prime ministers. Most held office just long enough to introduce fresh policies, which their successors promptly scrapped or reversed.The consequences, entrepreneurs say, aren't just political. They affect operations. Each new regime, entrepreneurs say, arrives not just with a different tone but with a dramatically different playbook. Business policies shift abruptly - from tax incentives to trade norms - often reversing the decisions of the previous administration. For those investing capital or hiring at scale, this volatility makes long-term planning feel less like strategy and more like guesswork.""We're not concerned about the political system,"" said a hotelier in Thamel. ""What we need is stability and regimes that take consistent decisions.""This inconsistency has contributed to a steady exodus of Nepali workers. Over 6 lakh Nepalis --people say the true figure is higher -- left the country last year for jobs abroad, mainly in Malaysia, South Korea and the Gulf. For many, migration has become a substitute for economic opportunity at home. Labour migration, once seen as a temporary fix, has become a structural feature of the economy. The economic footprint of this exodus is staggering. Remittances touched nearly $11 billion in 2023, accounting for over a quarter of Nepal's GDP. The money keeps families afloat, funds education, builds homes - and props up a national economy struggling with investment uncertainty and anaemic job creation.But the business community knows that exporting human capital is no long-term growth model. With domestic opportunity stalling, they are looking outward for trade, investment, and regional infrastructure partnerships - particularly with India. In 2022-23, India accounted for 64% of Nepal's total trade, valued at approximately $8.85 billion, according to India's ministry of external affairs. Yet entrepreneurs believe much of that relationship remains under-leveraged.Two newly built international airports in Pokhara and Bhairahawa remain underutilised, despite significant investment. Entrepreneurs cite aviation restrictions as one reason growth remains stifled. Himalayan Airlines, which has Chinese investors, has not been granted permission to fly to Indian cities. To be sure, Nepal has long requested new air entry points into India - via Janakpur, Nepalgunj and Mahendranagar - to shorten routes and improve connectivity. But progress has been slow, with Indian authorities citing security sensitivities, particularly near the Gorakhpur airbase. For now, all international flights into Nepal must detour through Simara, adding fuel costs and operational inefficiencies. ""We understand the concerns,"" said an aviation executive. ""But we believe there's space for flexibility that can benefit both nations.""On land, too, mobility remains uneven. Indian vehicles entering Nepal face nominal fees - Nepal Rs 250-500 (INR 150-300) per day - and little paperwork.In contrast, Nepali vehicles crossing into India are subject to cumbersome requirements: prior approvals, bank guarantees and multiple layers of documentation.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on a three-day state visit to Sri Lanka from April 4 to 6, held high-level talks with President Anura Kumara Dissanayake and oversaw the signing of seven Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) across key sectors including defence, energy, digital infrastructure, health, and trade.The visit also marked a significant diplomatic gesture as Sri Lanka conferred the prestigious Mithra Vibhushana medal on PM Modi — the highest such honour for a foreign leader.PM Modi and President Dissanayake held delegation-level talks in Colombo. The Indian side included external affairs minister S Jaishankar, foreign secretary Vikram Misri, and other senior officials.The discussions reviewed progress under the Joint Vision for a Shared Future, adopted during Dissanayake’s earlier state visit to India.PM Modi was accorded a grand ceremonial welcome at Colombo’s historic Independence Square — the first time any foreign leader has received such an honour at the venue. The Square is typically reserved for Sri Lanka’s own national celebrations and is deeply symbolic of the island nation’s post-colonial identity.“PM Narendra Modi was welcomed by President @anuradisanayake with a ceremonial reception at the Independence Square in Colombo,” MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal posted on X.India and Sri Lanka on Saturday inked a defence cooperation agreement, signalling a significant step forward in strategic ties between the two nations. The pact was signed following delegation-level talks between PM Modi and President Dissanayake in Colombo.President Dissanayake assured Modi that “Sri Lanka will not allow its territory to be used in any manner that could threaten India’s security interests.” He also expressed gratitude for India's consistent support: “India’s assistance to Sri Lanka in times of need and continuing solidarity are deeply cherished.”The defence pact is seen as part of India’s broader efforts to counter growing Chinese influence in the Indian Ocean region.Apart from the defence pact, six other MoUs were signed in areas such as:PM Modi and President Dissanayake also virtually inaugurated the Sampur solar power project , a key step towards Sri Lanka’s clean energy transition.In a first-of-its-kind honour, PM Modi was conferred the Mithra Vibhushana medal by the Sri Lankan President in recognition of his leadership and role in strengthening bilateral ties.This is the 22nd international honour Modi has received from a foreign government. The medal’s design reflects shared values: the Dharma Chakra for Buddhist heritage, Pun Kalasa symbolising prosperity, and Navarathna (nine gems) embedded in a globe, representing enduring friendship. The Sun and Moon signify the timeless nature of the India-Sri Lanka relationship.The honour, as described by the Sri Lankan government, is a tribute to Modi’s commitment to regional cooperation, cultural revival, and spiritual diplomacy.Upon his arrival in Colombo on Friday after the BIMSTEC Summit in Bangkok, PM Modi was welcomed by six Sri Lankan ministers, including the Foreign Minister and Health Minister.“Landed in Colombo. Grateful to the ministers and dignitaries who welcomed me at the airport. Looking forward to the programs in Sri Lanka,” PM Modi posted on X.Later that evening, Modi interacted with members of the Indian diaspora and attended a traditional puppet performance, highlighting the cultural bonds between the two nations.India's assistance to Sri Lanka during its economic crisis — totalling $4.5 billion — was acknowledged as ""unprecedented"" by Indian High Commissioner Santosh Jha.“It was a huge bit of assistance and we are continuing to work with Sri Lanka in providing it assistance in various areas and that is much appreciated here,” he told PTI.India is also expected to assist Sri Lanka on debt restructuring and has proposed a currency swap agreement to support macroeconomic stability.PM Modi is scheduled to visit Anuradhapura, where he will inaugurate Indian-funded development projects. He will also lay a wreath at the IPKF memorial, honouring Indian soldiers who served in Sri Lanka during the 1980s.","India-Sri Lanka sign landmark defence cooperation pact.

Protect minorities: Modi. Restrain Hasina: Yunus,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/protect-minorities-modi-restrain-hasina-yunus/articleshow/119993504.cms,"PM Modi meets Bangladesh's Muhammad Yunus on the sidelines of Bimstec Summit (Picture from X @narendramodi)

B'desh says reports of attacks on minorities 'hugely inflated'

PM Modi on Friday asked Bangladesh chief adviser Muhammad Yunus to ensure safety and security of minorities, including Hindus, in the country and thoroughly investigate ""atrocities"" committed against them.In their first bilateral meeting since the formation of the interim govt in Dhaka in Aug 2024, Modi sought positive and constructive relationship with Bangladesh based on pragmatism, and urged Yunus to avoid rhetoric that could vitiate the atmosphere.However, as Modi broached the subject of minorities and increasing radicalisation, a Bangladesh readout said, Yunus called for a reality check against what he described as social media propaganda and said ties should be shaped on basis of principles like territorial integrity and non-interference in internal affairs.Yunus came to the meeting in Bangkok armed with his own list of issues Dhaka considers important, including the extradition of Sheikh Hasina , border killings, Saarc cooperation and pending Teesta water-sharing agreement. Even in the absence of any assurance that India would consider extraditing the ousted PM, Bangladesh authorities described the meeting as constructive and fruitful, but called upon India to restrain her from making inflammatory statements. Modi touched upon the issue of polls in Bangladesh as he reiterated India's support for a democratic, stable, peaceful, progressive, and inclusive neighbour. According to Bangladesh, Modi said India's ties are with the country and not with a political party or organisation.PM Modi underlined that India believed in a people-centric approach to the relationship and highlighted the cooperation between the two countries over a long period that has delivered tangible benefits to people in both countries,"" said foreign secretary Vikram Misri.According to Misri, the PM spoke at length about the issue of minorities, expressing deep concern over their plight and telling Yunus how violence against them impacts society in India too. He expressed hope Bangladesh would be able to fulfil its responsibility of protecting minority communities.However, the minority issue remained a sticking point as Yunus, according to the Bangladesh readout of the meeting, said the reports of attacks on minorities were hugely inflated and ""the bulk of them were fake news"". He asked Modi to send reporters to Bangladesh to investigate the alleged attacks themselves.""The chief adviser said he has instituted an effective system for monitoring every incident of religious and gender violence in the country, and his govt was taking serious actions to stop any occurrence of such incidents,"" said Dhaka in a statement.While calling for Hasina to be extradited, Yunus also accused the former PM of destabilising Bangladesh through her ""inflammatory"" statements from India, calling it an abuse of the hospitality extended to her by the Indian govt. He also accused Hasina of committing crimes against humanity, citing a UN report about the human rights violations under her govt.""We request that Indian govt take appropriate measures to restrain her from continuing to make such incendiary statements while she remains in your country,"" said Yunus. Interestingly, according to Dhaka, Modi blamed social media for tensions over Hasina's remarks and said India doesn't have special preference for any party or individual.He also said Bangladesh remained thankful for the ""unwavering support"" of the govt and people of India during its most challenging time in 1971. ""Excellency, we seek to work together with you to set the relationship on the right track for the benefit of both our peoples,"" said Yunus, according to Bangladesh.While Yunus raised the issue of border killings, Modi told him strict enforcement of the law and prevention of illegal border crossings, especially at night, are necessary for maintaining border security and stability. The Bangladesh readout quoted Modi as saying Indian border troops opened fire only in self-defence and the fatalities occurred in Indian territories. Yunus stressed it is important to address this issue to build trust between the countries.""PM expressed his conviction that all issues of mutual interest between the two countries would continue to be addressed and resolved bilaterally through constructive discussions, in the interest of their long standing and mutually beneficial bilateral relationship,"" said the Indian govt. Modi also congratulated Yunus for taking over as Bimstec Chair and Yunus sought India's support for a free trade agreement that the inter-regional group is discussing.",PM Modi meets Bangladesh's Muhammad Yunus on the sidelines of Bimstec Summit.

The funds are being collected to help Shah pay a Nepal Rs 8 lakh (Rs 5 lakh)-penalty imposed by Kathmandu Metropolitan City for damage to public property during last week's pro-monarchy protest in central Kathmandu.This came even as govt sanctioned Nepal Rs 10 lakh (Rs 6.3 lakh) each for families of the two people killed in the violence. Meanwhile, Shah on Thursday denied any role in the unrest, saying the incident was triggered ""because of lapses and failures within govt"", rejecting the charge by PM K P Sharma Oli that the ex-king had incited the violence.A statement issued by Shah's secretariat said, ""The govt's shortcomings and weaknesses are responsible for this tragic incident."" Shah's communication secretary added that neither the palace nor the former monarch's supporters would take responsibility for the violence, vandalism or looting.""By holding him responsible for the deaths and arson, Oli govt is attempting to hide its own failures."" Rameshraj Bastola , who was dismissed from his role as tourism promoter in Lisbon, Portugal, on March 10 after he publicly supported Shah, contributed Nepal Rs 50,000 (Rs 31,000) and urged others to join the effort.

Poll Should the Indian government invest more in the Northeast for Bimstec collaboration? No, we need to focus elsewhere Yes, definitely

As he departed for Thailand to participate in the 6th Bimstec summit, PM Narendra Modi asserted India's Northeast lies at the heart of the inter-regional group, underlining the primacy of the northeastern states in the region, days after Bangladesh chief adviser Muhammad Yunus said in China the ""7 sisters"" are landlocked with no way of reaching the ocean. Modi's remark came ahead of a likely bilateral meeting between the two on Friday on the summit's margins.Modi and Yunus came face to face for the first time at the dinner hosted by Thailand PM Paetongtarn Shinawatra.Modi was seated between Yunus and Nepal PM KP Sharma Oli. An Indian govt source speaking on condition of anonymity said the meeting, as sought by Dhaka, is ""in the works"". Senior officials in Dhaka were quoted as saying that the leaders would meet on Friday afternoon, shortly after the Bimstec summit. The meeting, if it happens, would be the first between the leaders since the interim govt took charge in Bangladesh in Aug 2025.Separately, in a Bimstec ministerial, Jaishankar said that the North-East had emerged as a connectivity hub for the Bimstec and the completion of the India-Myanmar-Thailand trilateral highway will connect the region all the way to the Pacific Ocean. This, he said, would be a veritable game-changer.Yunus's office had clarified on Wednesday that his remarks about India's North-East had been made with ""honest intentions"" but were interpreted wrongly. The fact that he was speaking in China, while inviting Beijing to take advantage of Bangladesh's geographical location, raised eyebrows in India.Modi had last week written to Yunus on Bangladesh National Day, extending his felicitations and underlining the significance of working together on the basis of mutual sensitivity to each other's interests and concerns. India also remains concerned about the law-and-order situation in Bangladesh, and the threat to minorities amid increasing radicalisation in the country.According to govt sources, bilateral meetings are likely also with Nepal PM K P Sharma Oli and Myanmar junta chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, who is undertaking a rare visit abroad amid the civil war in the country for Bimstec.In his departure statement, Modi also said that Bimstec has emerged as a significant forum for promoting regional development, connectivity and economic progress in the Bay of Bengal region. ""I look forward to meeting the leaders of the Bimstec countries and engaging productively to further strengthen our collaboration with the interest of our people in mind,"" said Modi.Bimstec or the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation is an inter-regional grouping comprising five South Asian countries and two Asean states, lying in the littoral and adjacent areas of the Bay of Bengal. Bangladesh will take over as the chair of Bimstec at the Bangkok summit.At the last summit in Colombo in 2022, the leaders adopted the Bimstec Charter, completing its transition from a grouping to a regional organisation. With Saarc now non-functional because of the lack of any diplomatic engagement between India and Pakistan, the Indian govt has pushed Bimstec as an alternative for regional trade, connectivity and security. Addressing the Colombo summit, Modi had also called for expediti ng ongoing talks for a Bimstec free trade agreement (FTA) that would enhance mutual trade.The PM will also visit Sri Lanka from Bangkok. ""This follows the highly successful visit of President Dissanayaka to India last Dec. We will have the opportunity to review progress made on the joint vision of fostering partnerships for a shared future and provide further guidance to realise our shared objectives,"" he said in his departure statement.",PM Narendra Modi will attend the 6th Bimstec summit in Thailand. He will meet Bangladesh PM Muhammad Yunus on Friday.

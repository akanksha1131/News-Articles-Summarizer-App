His latest rant suggests mounting frustration,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us-streamers/is-hasanabi-serious-about-quitting-twitch-streaming-in-2026-his-latest-rant-suggests-mounting-frustration/articleshow/126280890.cms,"HasanAbi hinted he may quit Twitch streaming in 2026 during a heated livestream, expressing frustration with his community’s behavior toward fellow creators. He criticized viewers for misplaced aggression, warned of bans, and admitted he “hates Twitch streaming.” While no final decision was announced, his comments signaled burnout and raised real questions about his future on the platform.

HasanAbi says Twitch streaming has become exhausting





HasanAbi may quit Twitch streaming in 2026, a statement that sent ripples through his audience after a tense moment on a recent livestream. The political commentator was not jesting at the thought. It emerged in an uncivilized call where impatience overtook his customary restraint, and there came the shebang criticized in a relationship that he has long nurtured with his audience.The moment felt less like a threat and more like exhaustion speaking out loud. HasanAbi addressed what he sees as misplaced aggression within his community, especially when it spills over onto people he considers friends. His message was blunt, emotional, and impossible to ignore.During the stream, HasanAbi openly admitted how draining the platform has become for him. Responding to chat behavior he felt crossed a line, he said, “‘Chat is not listening to you, HasanAbi.’ Jesus Christ, dude! I fking... I hate Twitch streaming. I genuinely. Maybe, 2026, I just quit. Maybe, 2026, I just quit Twitch streaming, and I just go to, like, either full-time video on demand YouTube videos or just like go away entirely. I just, I can't. It's so lame. It's so shty. Everything sucks!”The frustration stemmed from viewers attacking other creators, including people close to him.After a moderator warned the chat to stop brigading a friend’s stream, HasanAbi made his stance clear. He told viewers to “be normal” and warned that bans would follow if the behavior continued. His anger was not performative. It was protective.He expanded on that frustration by pointing out what he sees as a warped sense of priorities. “Do not do fking dumb st like that. What the f**k's wrong with you guys, bro?” he said, before urging viewers to focus their energy elsewhere. “Preserve your energy and use it in the appropriate direction.”HasanAbi also criticized viewers for targeting streamer Atrioc, arguing that attacking politically aligned creators makes no sense. He urged them to challenge real political actors instead.Whether he ultimately leaves Twitch or not, the message was clear. HasanAbi is tired of policing his own audience, and 2026 now feels like a genuine crossroads rather than idle talk.","HasanAbi hinted he may quit Twitch streaming in 2026 during a heated livestream.

YouTuber Nick Shirley accuses Minnesota leaders and faces backlash from Somali community





Nick Shirley is a 23-year-old YouTuber from California. He is now at the center of a big national debate. On December 25, 2025, Nick Shirley posted a long video about daycare centers in Minnesota. In the video, he walked into buildings listed as active daycares. He said he found no children, no toys, and no staff. In one clip, he clearly said, “WHERE ARE THE CHILDREN?”Nick Shirley claimed these centers were getting millions of dollars from the state through the Child Care Assistance Program, also called CCAP. This program helps low-income families pay for child care. Nick Shirley said some centers were taking money without actually caring for children. The video spread fast online. It caught the attention of big political leaders and federal agencies. Soon after, federal investigators started looking into the claims, and Minnesota’s childcare funding came under review.Nick Shirley said the problem could be worth close to a billion dollars. He also blamed Minnesota leaders, including Governor Tim Walz, for failing to act sooner. His video went viral on X. His follower count jumped from about 200,000 to more than 800,000 in just days.High-profile figures shared the video. Elon Musk reposted it while talking about government waste. Vice President JD Vance also reacted publicly. After the video gained traction, federal agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, began reviewing the claims. Parts of Minnesota’s childcare funding were paused while checks were carried out.The controversy also sparked anger. Nick Shirley was confronted outside one location. A man shouted, “How much money are you making? How much money are you making off of this?” Nick replied, “This is about fraud. You’re defending fraud.” Critics say the video unfairly targets Somali Americans, since some daycare owners belong to that community. Nick Shirley has denied this. He has said many times that the issue is about public money, not race or religion.Some experts and local leaders questioned Nick Shirley’s methods. They said he did not check records for every site and entered some buildings without permission. Police asked him to leave one location for trespassing. Still, Minnesota Republican leaders confirmed they shared information with him, and state inspectors were sent out to check licensed centers.Nick Shirley has also said he fears for his safety. He claims he has received threats and is being followed. His family has publicly supported him. He says a second video is coming as federal investigations continue. The case now sits at the center of politics, public trust, and community tension across the country.Also Read: “This Is Fraud”: Nick Shirley Responds After Minnesota Daycare Video Sparks Race Claims And Somali Community Debate","Nick Shirley is a 23-year-old YouTuber from California.

“Jeez. So eerie”: Perez Hilton reacts to disturbing claims about Nick Reiner before parents’ killings,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us-streamers/jeez-so-eerie-perez-hilton-reacts-to-disturbing-claims-about-nick-reiner-before-parents-killings/articleshow/126280659.cms,"Perez Hilton reacted strongly to reports that Nick Reiner allegedly showed interest in owning a gun before the fatal stabbing of his parents, Rob and Michele Reiner. Calling the detail “eerie,” Hilton emphasized how it raises questions about intent, despite authorities confirming a knife was used. He also noted the emotional toll on the community as the investigation continues.

Perez Hilton reacts to Nick Reiner gun interest reports







Shock rippled through Hollywood this week as new details emerged in the murder case involving Rob Reiner and his wife, Michele. Perez Hilton reacts to Nick Reiner gun interest reports by capturing the unease many felt when learning about what allegedly crossed the suspect’s mind before the killings. The timing of those revelations has only deepened the sense of dread surrounding a case that already defies belief.Hilton addressed the reports directly on his website, drawing attention to the unsettling contrast between speculation and confirmed facts. While authorities say Rob and Michele Reiner were fatally stabbed inside their Brentwood home on December 14, the idea that their son may have been thinking about firearms beforehand added a disturbing psychological layer to the narrative. Hilton’s reaction struck a chord because it focused less on shock value and more on what intent can reveal.In his commentary, Hilton wrote, “Nick Reiner expressed an interest in buying a gun before allegedly murdering his parents, Rob and Michele….Jeez. So eerie.” He noted that official records confirm a knife was used, not a gun, yet emphasized how the reported interest in a firearm raised troubling questions.Citing sources close to the investigation, Hilton said Nick Reiner had allegedly “entertained the idea of getting a firearm,” though authorities have not confirmed whether any steps were taken to obtain one.Hilton leaned heavily on the emotional impact of that detail. He quoted a source describing how quickly events escalated, adding, “Everything escalated incredibly quickly. He wasn’t panicked — he was focused, and that’s what makes it so disturbing.” Another source framed the concern more starkly, saying, “The concern isn’t what he had; it’s what he was thinking about in those final days.”Beyond legal angles, Hilton highlighted the human fallout. Friends and neighbors remain shaken, many still struggling to process what happened. Hilton described the tragedy as “truly devastating,” pointing to reports that Nick Reiner had long battled mental health and addiction issues, including treatment for schizophrenia.Nick Reiner is also being held without bail awaiting his arraignment on January 7 as investigators keep putting the puzzle of the last hours before the killings together. Hilton left by saying that the case seems to have no conclusion, not only on the legal side but also on the emotional front of a community that was still left in need of answers.Also Read: “Backtracking on her praise”: Perez Hilton calls out Chappell Roan for deleting Brigitte Bardot tribute","Perez Hilton reacted to reports that Nick Reiner showed interest in owning a gun.

Why Saudi Arabia and the UAE import sand from Australia despite their endless deserts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/why-saudi-arabia-and-the-uae-import-sand-from-australia-despite-their-endless-deserts/articleshow/126249828.cms,"Despite vast deserts, Saudi Arabia and its Gulf neighbours rely on imported construction-grade sand to meet the demands of mega-projects like NEOM and the Burj Khalifa. Desert sand’s smooth grains are unsuitable for concrete, making riverbed and marine sand essential. This reliance highlights a global sand crisis, environmental pressures, and the urgent need for sustainable alternatives and innovation in construction materials.





Why desert sand won't do





Australia's role in supplying sand





The broader Gulf context





Vision 2030 and the need for quality



A global sand crisis





Sending coals to Newcastle is a phrase from the early 16th century, describing the pointless act of bringing coal to a city that already had plenty. As ironic as it may seem, similar paradoxes play out in the real world, sometimes on a massive scale. Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia and the UAE, for instance, are importing sand from countries such as Australia, China, and Belgium, according to the OEC. While the idea of desert nations buying sand seems puzzling, the reason lies in the specifics of construction requirements. As these countries race ahead with multi-billion-dollar projects, Saudi Arabia with its Vision 2030 developments, and the UAE with its skyline-transforming towers, the demand for a specific type of sand that deserts cannot provide has led to a steady stream of imports.This lesser-known fact sheds light on a broader global issue: the growing scarcity of construction-grade sand and the paradoxes of resource dependency even in the most unlikely places.Desert landscapes like Saudi Arabia’s might be abundant in sand, but ironically not all sand is created equal. The grains found in deserts are typically too round and smooth because they have often been eroded by wind over thousands of years.This makes them poorly suited for concrete production, where angular and coarse microscopic grains are essential to form a strong, cohesive structural mix when combined with cement and water ultimately.Concrete itself has three basic components: cement, water, and aggregate, combined in slightly different proportions depending on the intended strength and use. Cement is the powdery substance that reacts with water to form a ‘glue’, binding the mixture together. Because it is made from limestone and processed at incredibly high temperatures, cement production is highly energy-intensive and releases millions of tonnes of CO₂ each year. Some estimates suggest that the global cement industry alone may be responsible for up to 8% of the world’s CO₂ emissions , highlighting its environmental footprint.Aggregate provides concrete with its bulk. Depending on the mix, it can account for between 60 and 80% of the volume of concrete and 70-85% of its weight. Yet the term ‘aggregate’ masks the true origins of this essential material: it is made from a combination of coarse gravel and fine sediment, including sand, which can make up to 45% of the aggregate by volume. Crucially, not just any sand will do—its texture and shape are decisive factors in the strength and durability of the final concrete.The type of sand required for skyscrapers, infrastructure, and urban development usually comes from riverbeds, lakes, and seabeds, environments that produce more angular grains capable of binding effectively. Most natural sand is created through the slow, continuous process of weathering across various landscapes. A glance at satellite images shows just how abundant desert sand appears to be. Yet, despite its abundance, wind-tumbled desert grains are far too smooth and small to provide the necessary structural grip. The construction sector, therefore, relies on sand from quarries and riverbeds, where water-shaped grains are naturally angular, rough, and perfectly suited for cement to adhere.As investigative journalist Vince Beiser notes in The World in a Grain, trying to make concrete with desert sand is like “trying to build something out of a stack of marbles instead of a stack of little bricks.” The nuances of sand composition may seem trivial, but they underpin the foundations of cities and economies. According to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the world consumes around 50 billion tonnes of sand every year, making it the most extracted solid material globally—yet only a fraction is suitable for construction purposes.Australia has emerged as one of the key exporters of high-quality silica and construction sand. As per the OEC world, in 2023, Australia exported $273M of Sand, making it the 2nd largest exporter of Sand (out of 183) in the world with Saudi Arabia among the importers. In 2023, Saudi Arabia imported about US $140,000 worth of natural construction-grade sand from Australia.Saudi Arabia’s purchase of Australian sand, notably highlights the Kingdom’s reliance on these imports to meet construction standards for large-scale mega infrastructure projects. The conversation resurfaced on social media in 2024, as the trend clearly continues in the wake of Saudi Arabia's ambitious urban development plans, including NEOM, The Red Sea Project, and Qiddiya nationwide.These projects require not just vast amounts of concrete but also the highest standards in material quality, a demand that desert sand simply cannot fulfil.Saudi Arabia isn't alone in this phenomenon today. Other Gulf countries, including the UAE and Qatar, face the same paradox: vast deserts, yet a long-standing reliance on imported sand for high-quality construction. The UAE, particularly Dubai and Abu Dhabi, has increasingly sourced construction-grade sand from overseas to support its rapid skyline expansion, a necessity dictated by the structural demands of complex modern engineering.Consider the Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world at 828 metres. Its construction required immense quantities of materials: 39,000 tonnes of steel, 103,000 square metres of glass, and 330 million litres of concrete, enough to fill 132 Olympic-sized swimming pools. Desert sand, despite its abundance, was entirely unsuitable. Its grains are too small, round, and smooth to provide the fractured surfaces necessary for high-compression concrete, leading builders to import sand from Australia for the project.Sand in the UAE serves multiple roles beyond skyscrapers. It forms the basis of glass production, shapes artificial islands such as The Palm Jumeirah, and replenishes popular tourist beaches through large-scale ‘beach nourishment’ projects. According to the UN , constructing the Palm Jumeirah alone consumed 186.5 million cubic metres of marine sand, effectively exhausting local reserves.A 2024 UNEP policy brief reinforces this reality, noting that the Middle East’s rapid urbanisation is driving global demand for construction sand. While regional countries are beginning to explore more sustainable solutions, the near-term dependence on imports remains entrenched.Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030, a blueprint to diversify the Kingdom’s economy beyond oil is driving massive infrastructure developments. The $500 billion NEOM city, the futuristic The Line urban concept, and other mega-projects require specialised building materials that meet international standards.Thus, importing industrial-grade sand isn't just a matter of preference but often a necessity. Without it, the construction of ultra-modern facilities, smart cities, and tourism hubs would face significant material shortages or quality compromises.The dependence on imported sand is not just a Saudi issue; it reflects a growing global and urgent concern. The UNEP has flagged that the world is facing a ""sand crisis,"" warning that unregulated sand extraction is leading to environmental degradation in many parts of the world, including riverbed erosion, habitat destruction, and loss of biodiversity.In response, some countries are investing in alternatives like manufactured sand (M-sand), made by crushing rocks to create suitable construction material. Additionally, recycled construction waste is being repurposed to alleviate pressure on natural sand resources.Saudi Arabia, too, is actively exploring these options. While there's no comprehensive national policy yet on reducing sand imports, experts suggest that ongoing innovation in materials science could eventually help the Kingdom lessen its reliance on foreign sand.","Despite vast deserts, Saudi Arabia and its Gulf neighbours rely on imported construction-grade sand.

Scope of the wage increase









From January 2026, private sector employers across the UAE will need to meet a higher wage bar for emirati employees or risk having work permits blocked and Emiratisation counts affected, as the government moves to tighten enforcement around national employment and pay standards.The Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation has announced that the minimum wage for emirati citizens working in the private sector will increase to Dh6,000, effective January 1, 2026. The move is aimed at strengthening emiratisation outcomes and improving job stability for nationals employed outside the public sector.The announcement was made through the ministry’s digital platforms, with the update first appearing on the MoHRE smart application on December 27. The revised minimum wage will apply to all private sector services related to the issuance, renewal, or amendment of Emirati work permits.From January 1, 2026, any application for an emirati work permit that lists a salary below Dh6,000 will not be processed or issued. Employers will also be prevented from printing or submitting applications for the issuance, renewal, or amendment of citizen work permits if the registered salary does not meet the minimum threshold.MoHRE said it will send automated alert notifications through its service channels and the MoHRE smart application to inform employers of the new requirement. Employers will be prompted to adjust salaries to ensure compliance before applications can move forward.The ministry has set June 30, 2026, as the deadline for employers to correct salaries that fall below the new minimum.If an emirati employee’s salary is not updated by that date, enforcement measures will take effect from July 1, 2026. These include excluding the employee from Emiratisation quota calculations until the salary is corrected, and placing a restriction on the establishment that blocks the issuance of new work permits due to Emirati salaries being below Dh6,000.MoHRE clarified that the Dh6,000 minimum wage applies only to emirati work permits with a two-year validity, whether newly issued, renewed, or amended, and that salaries must meet the requirement from January 1, 2026.Previously, the ministry required emiratis hired from January 1, 2025, to be paid a minimum salary of Dh5,000 by the end of February 2025. Failure to meet that earlier requirement meant affected employees would not be counted toward Emiratisation targets, and establishments could face restrictions on issuing new work permits until salaries were adjusted.","From 1 January 2026, Emiratis in the private sector must earn at least Dh6,000 monthly. The move is aimed at strengthening emiratisation outcomes and improving job stability for nationals employed outside the public sector. Employers will be prompted to adjust salaries to ensure compliance before applications can move forward.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126264065,imgsize-925659,width-400,resizemode-4/uae.jpg"

Saudi-UAE Clash: MBS' Ultimatum To Al Nahyan After Blowing Up Weapons | ‘Don’t Cross Our Red Line!’

What happened in Mukalla

What is the STC?

A ‘red line’ between Saudi and UAE

What the UAE said

Why the east matters to Riyadh

Yemen’s leadership steps in

Why this matters for Yemen

(With inputs from agencies)





Saudi Arabia’s airstrikes on Yemen’s southern port city of Mukalla this week have exposed a sharp and public rupture inside what was once a unified Gulf-backed coalition.What began as a complex war against the Iran-aligned Houthi movement has now evolved into an open confrontation between partners who once fought on the same side.The strikes followed the arrival of two vessels from the UAE port of Fujairah, which Saudi Arabia says unloaded weapons and armoured vehicles destined for the UAE-backed Southern Transitional Council (STC), a separatist force seeking self-rule in southern Yemen. Riyadh described the shipments as an “imminent threat” to its national security and warned that Emirati actions were “extremely dangerous”, language that underscored the seriousness of the fallout.At the heart of the dispute lies Saudi Arabia’s fear that instability in Yemen’s eastern provinces, particularly Hadramout and al-Mahra, could spill directly onto its borders.Saudi warplanes struck targets in Mukalla after the Saudi-led coalition accused two ships of arriving without authorisation, disabling their tracking systems and unloading “a large amount of weapons and combat vehicles” to support the STC.Riyadh said the operation was limited, conducted overnight, and aimed at preventing collateral damage.“The crews had the disabled tracking devices aboard the vessels and unloaded a large amount of weapons and combat vehicles in support of Southern Transitional Council’s forces,” the coalition said. “Considering that the aforementioned weapons constitute an imminent threat, and an escalation that threatens peace and stability, the Coalition Air Force has conducted this morning a limited airstrike.”Footage aired by Yemeni state media showed black smoke rising from the port and burned vehicles near the docks. Saudi state media said there were no casualties, though local residents reported damage to nearby homes.The Southern Transitional Council (STC) is a separatist movement in southern Yemen that seeks autonomy or independence for the region. It was formed in May 2017 following mass protests in the southern port city of Aden over the dismissal of its leader, Aidarus al-Zoubaidi, who now heads the council.The STC’s stated goal is to “reinstate the Southern State”, referring to the independent country that existed in South Yemen between 1967 and unification with the north in 1990. Support for southern secession has long existed, but gained momentum after Yemen’s civil war erupted in 2014.Backed by the United Arab Emirates, the STC controls key territory in the south, including Aden, and commands armed forces known as the Southern Armed Forces. While it has at times shared power with Yemen’s internationally recognised government, its core demand for southern self-rule remains unchanged.The STC now faces a critical test. It is part of the Presidential Leadership Council, yet its forces have seized swathes of territory from Saudi-backed units. Its leadership insists the UAE remains a “main partner” in the fight against the Houthis and has rejected Al-Alimi’s orders, saying they lack consensus.While the STC has framed its advance as consolidating southern control, defying Riyadh carries risks. Saudi Arabia controls Yemen’s airspace and has made clear it will act to prevent any shift that threatens its security interests.Saudi Arabia and the UAE were once the twin pillars of the coalition formed in 2015 to restore Yemen’s internationally recognised government after the Houthis seized the capital, Sanaa. While both opposed the Houthis, their long-term goals increasingly diverged.Riyadh has remained committed to a unified Yemen under the internationally recognised government. Abu Dhabi, by contrast, has backed the STC, which seeks to revive the formerly independent state of South Yemen. That divergence has now erupted into open confrontation.Saudi Arabia accused the UAE of pressuring the STC to carry out military operations near its borders, calling such actions a “threat to the kingdom’s national security”. “The Kingdom stresses that any threat to its national security is a red line,” the Saudi foreign ministry said, adding that it would not hesitate to act.The UAE rejected the accusations, saying the shipment “did not contain any weapons” and that the vehicles were intended for Emirati forces operating in Yemen. It condemned any attempt to implicate it in operations threatening Saudi security and called for restraint and coordination.The UAE said it was surprised by the Saudi airstrike and rejected allegations that it directed STC military operations.“The UAE categorically rejects any attempt to implicate it in the tensions between Yemeni parties,” its foreign ministry said, calling for restraint and coordination.Abu Dhabi said its presence in Yemen was at the invitation of the internationally recognised government and within the Saudi-led coalition framework. It urged that recent developments be handled “responsibly and in a way that prevents escalation”.Later in the day, the UAE announced that it would withdraw its remaining forces from Yemen.""The Ministry of Defence announces the termination of the remaining counterterrorism teams in Yemen,"" a statement from the ministry said, as cited by news agency AFP.The focus on Hadramout and al-Mahra is no coincidence. Hadramout borders Saudi Arabia and has deep economic and historical ties with the kingdom. Al-Mahra sits astride key land routes linking Yemen to Oman and Saudi Arabia and controls vital ports and crossings.For Riyadh, large-scale instability in the east is not a distant Yemeni problem but a direct border security issue. Saudi officials fear that unchecked STC expansion could redraw control over resource-rich areas and trade routes, creating long-term insecurity along the kingdom’s southern frontier.This explains why Saudi Arabia warned the STC against advancing into Hadramout and demanded a withdrawal, a call the separatists dismissed.The escalation was framed politically through Yemen’s internationally recognised leadership. Rashad al-Alimi, head of the Presidential Leadership Council, cancelled a defence pact with the UAE and ordered Emirati forces to leave Yemen within 24 hours. In a televised speech, he accused Abu Dhabi of fuelling strife by backing the STC.“Unfortunately, it has been definitively confirmed that the United Arab Emirates pressured and directed the STC to undermine and rebel against the authority of the state through military escalation,” he said.Al-Alimi also imposed a temporary no-fly zone and a sea and ground blockade on ports and crossings, except for coalition-approved exemptions, signalling the seriousness of the moment.The escalation risks opening a new front in Yemen’s decade-long war, with anti-Houthi forces turning on each other while the Houthis remain entrenched in the north, including in Sanaa.More than ten years of conflict have already killed over 150,000 people and created one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises. Strategic southern regions now at the centre of the dispute hold key ports and most of Yemen’s oil reserves.","Saudi Arabia and the UAE were once the twin pillars of the coalition formed in 2015 to restore Yemen’s internationally recognised government.

Taking the subway to celebrate 2026? Here are the lines most prone to delays,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/taking-the-subway-to-celebrate-2026-here-are-the-lines-most-prone-to-delays/articleshow/126280702.cms,"Kennedy Center New Year Shows CANCELLED After X-Mas; The Cookers, Doug Varone & Dancers Declare EXIT





As New Yorkers step out to ring in 2026 together, no one wants a late-night celebration derailed by a delayed train. But if you’re relying on the subway, some lines are more likely than others to slow you down.Here’s a look at the subway lines and trains most likely to delay your New Year’s trip, New York post reported.For the second straight year, the B train has taken the dubious title of New York City’s tardiest subway line — as it arrived late as much as 26% of the time, according to a Post analysis of MTA data.The poor performance actually marked a slight improvement for the troubled B line — as in 2024 it took the least on time crown with a dismal 65.1% rate of being late. That was worse than the low it hit in 2019 of 65.4 percent.This past year the B maintained an improved average on-time rate of 78.5%, with service dipping to its worst in July at 74.1%.The B is one of over a dozen trains that had on-time — or within five minutes of its scheduled arrival — averages of 85% or less this year.The train — which is best known as one of the main ways to get to Yankee Stadium — starts in the Bronx and heads through Manhattan into Brooklyn, with one end in Brighton Beach.Among the issues that caused the line to be so delayed is that it frequently shares tracks with other trains, especially in Manhattan, and can slow to a crawl at major intersections, Streetsblog reported. It also has antiquated signals for much of its length.While a dozen lines in total had on-time averages below 85 percent, the MTA cast this year’s numbers as an improvement over the past.In a December year-end report, New York City Transit President Demetrius Crichlow praised the transit system’s “good momentum over the past few months,” delivering an overall 84.4% on-time average in November — the “best November in modern history outside of the pandemic era.”September’s 85% on-time average similarly broke records, as well as August’s 85.1% average that marked the “best August in a decade.”Crichlow also noted that, since implementing subway timetable changes in November, the B train’s on-time averages jumped to 80.7% in the same month.“Similar updates on the C produced a 9-point improvement from October, and the line’s best non-COVID monthly performance,” Crichlow said.“Our shift toward data-driven operations and more advanced analytics also extends to stronger scheduling practices. Each schedule update is an opportunity to surgically pinpoint bottlenecks across the system and implement changes that improve the rider experience.”The most punctual train overall this year was the L, the data show.The system’s failing, old-time signals plague many lines, and the B is just one of over a dozen trains that had on-time averages of 85% or less this year.The D, Q, M and F trains followed suit, with 12-month on-time averages standing at 79.4%, 79.7%, 80.4% and 81.5%, respectively.The G, J/Z, R, N, A, C and 2 trains were marginally better, but all still maintained lower than 85% on-time rates.And to the MTA, “on-time” is even all that on time, as a train only as to be with-in five minutes of its scheduled time to be considered on schedule.The most punctual train overall this year was the L, arriving on-time roughly 90.3% of the time in 2025, the data show, followed by the 7 (89.8%), 6 (89.6%) and 1 (89%) lines.Save for the 42nd Street and Franklin Avenue shuttle trains, the L was the only train this year to crack above 90% arrival rates.The L’s service is one of nine trains that dipped in on-time arrival rates compared to 2024 – alongside all three of the system’s shuttles and the 7, J/Z, G, M and Q trains.Of the bunch, the Rockaway shuttle train and the M and G lines faltered the most year-over-year, with arrival rates plummeting 7.4%, 6.4% and 6.3%, respectively.Crowd of people waiting on the platform at the Jay St-Metro Tech subway station.Systemwide, delays were down 3.2% since last year and 4.9% since 2019 – with the biggest improvements being seen in the C, 2 and B trains.Those lines saw on-time arrival averages increase 15.5%, 14.4% and 13.4% since 2024.Still, the MTA could be doing more to target known delay-causing issues — such as planned work, police and medical issues — to further improve performance, according to a scathing September report from State Comptroller Thomas P. DiNapoli.Systemwide, delays were down 3.2% since last year and 4.9% since 2019 – with the biggest improvements being seen in the C, 2 and B trains.“Targeting problem areas like signals and issues with subway cars that add to delays can improve straphangers experience and boost ridership,” DiNapoli wrote, noting that subway car problems are the “fastest-rising” cause of major incidents.“Working with the Police Department, Fire Department, and Homeless Services can also help reduce incidents that cause delays,” the comptroller added.“Above all, the MTA should be clear and open about the work it is prioritizing to reduce delays and how those actions will benefit the public.”","For the second straight year, the B train has taken the dubious title of New York City’s tardiest subway line.

Indians can now apply for the H-1B renewal from a third country. Yes, this is what a Reddit user claimed.Indian H-1B visa holders can now opt to apply from third countries such as the United Arab Emirates amid long appointment backlogs at US consulates in India, provided they hold valid residency permits.One Indian citizen with a Dubai residency visa recently applied for an H-1B renewal at the US Consulate in Dubai after their original interview appointment in India was postponed from December 15 to March 9, as per Reddit post.Under US visa rules, applicants were permitted to apply in countries other than their home country if they held a valid residency permit. In Dubai, consular officials verified this using the Emirates ID, though applicants noted that home-country appointments were still generally preferred.The applicant said the process at the Dubai consulate was “simple and straightforward”, with minimal crowds and short wait times, possibly due to reduced staffing during the holiday season.The visit followed a three-step process across separate counters for document verification, biometrics and the visa interview. At the first counter, officials checked the passport, Form I-797 approval notice, Emirates ID and photograph.As the applicant’s photo was outdated, they were asked to retake it on-site, a service that cost 80 dirhams and required exact cash or card payment.The applicant briefly forgot to carry cash or a card but said consular staff were accommodating and allowed them to exit and re-enter the facility to retrieve payment. They also described a moment of kindness from a fellow applicant who offered financial help when they appeared stressed.The applicant described the visa interview as conversational and cordial. The consular officer asked standard questions about employment history, job role, salary, education, time spent in the US and family ties in Dubai. The officer also referenced a “Know Your Rights” brochure provided during the biometrics stage and asked the applicant what they understood from it.No questions were asked about social media accounts, though the applicant had disclosed Facebook and Instagram details on the DS-160 form.At the end of the interview, the consular officer approved the visa and told the applicant the passport would be ready for pickup within five to seven business days.The experience showed third-country processing, particularly in locations such as Dubai, emerged as a viable alternative for Indian H-1B holders navigating extended visa appointment delays at home consulates.","Indian H-1B visa holders can now opt to apply from third countries such as the United Arab Emirates amid long appointment backlogs at US consulates in India.

The order was not a final ruling but was a significant and rare setback by the high court for the President’s efforts.In the nation’s capital, District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb sued to halt the deployments of more than 2,000 guardsmen.In Oregon, a federal judge permanently blocked the deployment of National Guard troops there.California National Guard troops had already been removed from the streets of Los Angeles by Dec. 15 after a court ruling. But an appeals court had paused a separate part of the order that required control of the Guard to return to Gov. Gavin Newsom.In a Tuesday court filing, the Trump administration said it was no longer seeking a pause in that part of the order. That paved the way for the California National Guard troops to fully return to state control after Trump federalised the Guard in June.","Trump said in a social media post Wednesday that he was removing the Guard troops for now. “We will come back, perhaps in a much different and stronger form, when crime begins to soar again - Only a question of time!” he wrote.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126278976,imgsize-84210,width-400,resizemode-4/donald-trump.jpg"

The Oklahoma Highway Patrol issued a warning after a trooper had to perform a maneuver to stop a sleeping driver's vehicle from crashing recently on the Will Rogers Turnpike in northeastern Oklahoma.Around 12:20 p.m. on December 13, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol received multiple calls about a newer-model Kia driving slowly in the right lane of the Will Rogers Turnpike. Callers reported that the driver appeared to be slumped over inside the car.Lt. Brian McSlarrow found the vehicle near the rest stop in Vinita, and the car was going 40 mph on the turnpike. Although the vehicle stayed in its lane, the driver was weaving back and forth inside the lane, KOCO News5 reported.McSlarrow confirmed that the driver was slumped over but couldn't determine whether he was fatigued or was experiencing a medical emergency, according to the Oklahoma Highway Patrol.

"‘Rot in hell’: Trump unleashes fury on Jared Polis, Dan Rubinstein over Tina Peters’ imprisonment",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/rot-in-hell-trump-unleashes-fury-on-jared-polis-dan-rubinstein-over-tina-peters-imprisonment/articleshow/126276881.cms,"



US President Donald Trump ripped Colorado Governor Jared Polis and Mesa County District Attorney Dan Rubinstein and said that they should “rot in hell” over the incarceration of former election clerk Tina Peters.“God Bless Tina Peters, who is now, for two years out of nine, sitting in a Colorado Maximum Security Prison, at the age of 73, and sick, for the ‘crime’ of trying to stop the massive voter fraud that goes on in her State (where people are leaving in record numbers!),” Trump posted on Truth Social.Referring to Polis as “the Scumbag Governor,” the President added that he wishes “only the worst. May they rot in Hell. FREE TINA PETTERS!”Trump also attacked the Democratic Governor in a separate post, claiming Colorado and California were the “TOP OUTBOUND STATES IN 2025 (United Van Lines!) — In other words, PEOPLE LEAVING!!!”“That’s what bad governors do to even places blessed with beautiful surrounds and climate,” the second post reads.In a statement obtained by The Hill, Rubinstein said, “There’s a saying in the law: if the facts are on your side, pound the facts; if the law is on your side, pound the law; if neither is on your side, pound the table.”“President Trump has no facts and no law here,” Rubinstein continued. “After trying and failing to invent both, he’s left with nothing but pounding the table.”Last week, Peters asked for a Colorado appeals court to accept Trump’s presidential pardon freeing her, arguing that the appeals court no longer has jurisdiction over her case because of the pardon.Presidents do not have the power to overturn state convictions.At the time Trump announced her clemency, he mocked Polis and suggested the Governor “allowed his State to go to hell.”The administration also attempted to transfer Peters from state to federal custody, but the Colorado Department of Corrections denied the request.Peters was convicted on state charges tied to illegally tampering with voting machines in the 2020 election. She was later sentenced to nine years in prison.Trump has sought to help people convicted of crimes related to his claims that he did not lose the 2020 election, including those convicted or charged in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.His criticism of Polis over Peters comes after the President vetoed a bill to complete a project that would have delivered water to southeastern Colorado, one of the first vetoes of his second term. Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) blasted the administration for vetoing “a completely non-controversial, bipartisan bill that passed both the House and Senate unanimously.”Boebert said in a post on social platform X that despite the veto, “This isn’t over.”The White House’s defence for the veto cited the project’s cost.“H.R. 131 would continue the failed policies of the past by forcing Federal taxpayers to bear even more of the massive costs of a local water project — a local water project that, as initially conceived, was supposed to be paid for by the localities using it,” the memo reads.","Tina Peters was convicted on state charges tied to illegally tampering with voting machines in the 2020 election.

New York Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani on Tuesday announced the appointment of lawyer Ramzi Kassem as New York City’s chief counsel, the city’s top legal position.Kassem, whose past legal work includes representing Ahmed al-Darbi in an al–Qaeda–related terrorism case, will assume the role when Mamdani takes office on January 1.""Welcome to A New Era, Ramzi Kassem! Ramzi Kassem joins the administration from the City University of New York School of Law, where he co-founded and now co-directs CLEAR (Creating Law Enforcement Accountability & Responsibility), which has been on the front lines of providing legal defense for students detained by ICE and supporting many more at risk. Kassem also served under President Joe Biden as Senior Policy Advisor.

'PEOPLE WILL DIE IN NYC': Huge Warning To Zohran MamdanI; Elon Revolts Over Mayor's First Big Move





As the clock strikes midnight on New Year’s Day, Zohran Mamdani will officially assume office as the mayor of New York City, marking the start of his term with two separate swearing-in ceremonies.The Democrat’s team has planned a private oath-taking with family at midnight, followed by a public ceremony in the afternoon outside City Hall.The first oath will be held at the former City Hall subway station in Manhattan, one of the city’s original subway stops known for its tiled arches and vaulted ceilings. It will be administered by New York Attorney General Letitia James, a political ally and notable foe of former President Donald Trump.Mamdani’s office said the choice of venue reflects his “commitment to the working people who keep our city running every day.”“When Old City Hall Station first opened in 1904 — one of New York’s 28 original subway stations — it was a physical monument to a city that dared to be both beautiful and build great things that would transform working peoples’ lives,” Mamdani said.“That ambition need not be a memory confined only to our past, nor must it be isolated only to the tunnels beneath City Hall: it will be the purpose of the administration fortunate enough to serve New Yorkers from the building above.”Later in the day, Mamdani will take a second oath on the steps of City Hall at 1 pm. The oath will be administered by US Senator Bernie Sanders , one of his political heroes, while US Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez will deliver the opening remarks.The public swearing-in will be accompanied by a block party along Broadway leading up to City Hall, featuring performances, music and interfaith elements. Mamdani’s office expects thousands of people to attend.According to the mayor’s office, Mamdani’s inaugural committee includes actor John Turturro, playwright Cole Escola, writer Colson Whitehead, as well as advocates, small business owners and campaign workers who have “provided perspective, guidance, and cultural sensibility” for the ceremony.Holding two ceremonies follows a long-standing tradition for incoming New York City mayors. Outgoing Mayor Eric Adams held his initial oath at Times Square shortly after the famous ball drop, while his predecessor, Bill de Blasio, took his first oath at home in Brooklyn.The dual-ceremony format allows Mamdani to combine a personal, family-focused moment with a large public celebration to welcome the new administration.","Zohran Mamdani will officially assume office as the mayor of New York City on New Year's Day.

The founder responds







Indian-origin startup founders are facing a hard time with their companies right now. From being blackmailed to being defamed, anything is up for grabs when it comes to them. Recently, a 16-year-old Indian-origin founder has called out a customer for bullying and threatening to 'destroy' his startup over what he claims is a misunderstanding.Om Patel, a Canada-based entrepreneur shared that the customer began threatening him after facing a login issue, even though it was fixed immediately. Patel, is the founder of BigIdeasDB. In a September 2025 interview with Indieniche, he described his startup as “a platform that helps entrepreneurs and founders discover validated startup ideas by analysing real user complaints from G2 reviews, App Store reviews, and Reddit threads. ”It was during the COVID pandemic, that Patel began to learn coding at the age of 12. He launched his startup in early 2024 and since then, it has generated over CAD$23,000 in revenue.Earlier this week, a customer named Adam emailed Patel and called his product a scam. He demanded an immediate refund, failing which he threatened to post negative feedback about the company on “every Hackernews article and Reddit post”.“Hi, as you know, this product is clearly a scam. The content is fake, the login does not work (redirects to localhost), and the platform is broken. Either refund immediately or I will:Adam's email was sent at 9:45 pm and within four minutes Patel responded saying an update had been pushed which would fix the problem in under 30 minutes. “Somehow, a pull request was merged into main with a redirect to localhost (that's why you weren't able to get in) after the Stripe Webhook was created,” he explained.“I can assure you this product is NOT a scam, just a simple misunderstanding and that's 100% on our part,” he added. Adam however, did not buy the explanation and pushed on his demand for a refund.Thus, Patel took the matter to X. He shared the screenshots of their exchange and accused Adam of trying to ""destroy"" his startup and reputation. He claimed the customer continued with his threats even after the refund was processed.He explained that Adam purchased a subscription to his product but found a login issue within minutes. “I offered a full refund immediately. No questions asked. Problem solved, right? Wrong. Even AFTER processing his refund, he continued with threats and hostile messages.”Additionally, he also accused the customer of bullying him because of his age. ""Some people think they can bully you because of your age. Imagine being so entitled that a 30-second technical glitch makes you try to destroy a 16-year-old's entire future,"" he wrote at the end of the post.The netizens rallied behind the founder, advising him to move on and continue improving his startup.","Om Patel, a 16-year-old Indian-origin founder has called out a customer for bullying and threatening to 'destroy' his startup over what he claims is a misunderstanding.

Explained: How the Israel issue is splintering MAGA,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/explained-how-the-israel-issue-is-splintering-maga/articleshow/126274166.cms,"Japan Mayhem: Casualties In Powerful 7.5 Japan Quake; Apocalyptic 'MEGAQUAKE' Looms, Alert Issued

The old MAGA–Israel bargain

The new MAGA revolt

Media civil war on the right

Theology, rewritten

Trump’s strategic silence

Why this matters





For nearly half a century, support for Israel was the closest thing the American right had to a theological constant. It bound together evangelical Christians, Cold War hawks, neoconservatives, and Republican donors into a durable, almost unexamined consensus. Donald Trump’s first term appeared to mark its triumph: Jerusalem recognised as Israel’s capital, the Abraham Accords signed, and Benjamin Netanyahu embraced as a political soulmate.And yet, in Trump’s second term, that old certainty is cracking. Not because Trump himself has turned against Israel. He has not. The fracture exists because the movement built around him is no longer ideologically unified on the question. Israel has become the issue exposing MAGA’s internal fault lines: generational, theological, ideological, and in some cases, disturbingly antisemitic.To understand the rupture, it helps to recall how the alliance was formed. The modern Republican commitment to Israel was never just strategic. It was theological.From the late 1970s onwards, evangelical Christians, particularly those influenced by premillennial dispensationalism, came to see the modern state of Israel as part of a divine timetable. Israel’s survival and expansion were read as signs of biblical prophecy moving towards its final act.Supporting Israel was not merely good foreign policy. It was obedience.This belief system dovetailed neatly with Cold War geopolitics. Israel was framed as a democratic outpost against Soviet-backed Arab regimes. By the Reagan era, the alliance between the Christian Right, neoconservatives, and pro-Israel lobbying groups had hardened into Republican orthodoxy. Questioning Israel became politically radioactive inside the party.Trump inherited this structure and amplified it. He did not build the pro-Israel consensus. He weaponised it.What has changed is not Trump’s position, but MAGA’s composition.The Republican Party that emerged after 2016 absorbed voters who were younger, more online, more conspiratorial, and less tethered to Cold War or Holocaust-era moral frameworks. Many of them arrived through anti-establishment anger rather than religious conviction. For this cohort, “America First” does not automatically translate into reflexive support for Israel.Surveys and focus groups of younger Republicans now show a sharp divergence. Older GOP voters remain overwhelmingly pro-Israel. Newer MAGA-aligned voters are far more sceptical and sometimes openly hostile. Their objections often begin with foreign policy arguments. Why spend billions abroad when America faces inflation, immigration, and cultural decline at home?But the line between isolationism and antisemitism has increasingly blurred. Online MAGA spaces circulate conspiracies about Jewish power, Israel’s influence over Washington, and shadowy financial networks. What was once fringe white nationalist rhetoric is now bleeding into broader right-wing discourse.This ideological drift has spilled into an open media war.Figures like Tucker Carlson have emerged as the most influential critics of Israel on the mainstream right. Carlson has attacked Christian Zionism as a form of theological corruption, arguing that American Christians have been manipulated into sacrificing national interest for a foreign state. His critiques are framed as intellectual and nationalist, but they overlap uncomfortably with ideas long associated with the antisemitic right.At the harder edge of this ecosystem sits Nick Fuentes, whose explicitly antisemitic worldview dispenses with policy arguments altogether and instead treats Israel and Jews as civilisational enemies. Fuentes remains toxic to much of the Republican establishment, but his ideas circulate freely online and increasingly seep into broader MAGA discourse, often laundered through euphemism and irony.On the other side stand voices like Ben Shapiro, who defend Israel as both a moral ally and a strategic necessity. The clashes between these camps, sometimes literal and played out on conference stages, have turned Israel into a loyalty test inside conservative media.Activists such as Candace Owens have gone further, adopting language that portrays Israel in almost metaphysical terms of evil. What once would have ended a conservative career now circulates freely within parts of the MAGA ecosystem.Beneath the politics lies a quieter but more consequential shift. Theology.Younger conservative Christians are moving away from dispensationalist readings of the Bible that placed Israel at the centre of God’s plan. Some are gravitating towards postmillennial or Christian nationalist frameworks that see America, not Israel, as the chosen civilisational project. Others, including high-profile MAGA figures, have turned towards Catholicism, which does not share evangelical Zionism’s end-times obsession.The result is a worldview where Israel is no longer sacred, nor even particularly special. In some interpretations, Judaism itself is framed as incomplete or obsolete. This idea has a long and ugly history in Christian Europe. When this theology merges with nationalist grievance, the outcome is not merely scepticism of Israel, but hostility towards Jews as a group.Trump has watched this fracture with characteristic pragmatism. He continues to back Israel unequivocally, hosts Netanyahu, and defends Israeli military actions without hesitation. But he has shown little interest in disciplining anti-Israel or antisemitic elements within his broader coalition.His likely successor in MAGA politics, JD Vance, has been notably noncommittal, avoiding clear statements that might alienate either camp. This ambiguity is not accidental. MAGA is now a coalition held together less by ideology than by resentment, and Israel has become one of the issues where those resentments collide.The Israel split reveals something larger about MAGA’s future.For decades, Republican foreign policy was anchored by moral clarity. Sometimes simplistic, sometimes selective, but stable. That clarity is gone. In its place is a volatile mix of isolationism, online radicalisation, theological revisionism, and generational fatigue with inherited causes.Israel is not just another foreign policy debate inside MAGA. It is the test case for whether the movement becomes a disciplined nationalist project or drifts further into conspiratorial populism. It also raises a darker question. Who decides what, and who, is allowed inside the MAGA tent?Trump may still dominate the present. But the fight over Israel suggests that the post-Trump right will be far less predictable, far less coherent, and far more willing to tear up alliances once thought eternal.","For nearly half a century, support for Israel was the closest thing the American right had to a theological constant. But in Trump’s second term, that old certainty is cracking. The fracture exists because the movement built around him is no longer ideologically unified on the question.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126274165,imgsize-789719,width-400,resizemode-4/how-the-israel-issue-is-splintering-maga.jpg"
Body found near San Antonio home of missing Texas teen Camila Mendoza Olmos,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/body-found-near-san-antonio-home-of-missing-texas-teen-camila-mendoza-olmos/articleshow/126273852.cms,"



A body has been found near the San Antonio home of Camila Mendoza Olmos, the 19-year-old Texas teen who went missing shortly after leaving her house on the morning of Christmas Eve. Authorities said the discovery was made during a renewed search effort, but the body has not yet been formally identified, and no official cause of death has been determined.The Bexar County Sheriff's Office confirmed the discovery on Tuesday afternoon, December 30, after search teams returned to an area that had already been examined earlier in the investigation. The body was found in a field roughly 100 yards from Mendoza Olmos’ home, an area that was searched again due to concerns that tall grass may have obscured visibility during previous sweeps.Sheriff Javier Salazar said the body was located at approximately 4.45 pm local time and was wearing clothing that appeared “very similar” to what investigators believe Camila was wearing when she was last seen. While the proximity to her home and the clothing have raised concern, Salazar stressed that forensic identification is still pending.“We hope that we can expedite that process to try to get the community answers,” Salazar said during a briefing.According to the sheriff, investigators do not currently suspect foul play. He said there were indications of self-harm, but declined to provide specific details, citing the sensitivity of the case and the need to wait for confirmation from the medical examiner.A firearm was found near the body, Salazar confirmed. Investigators had previously been searching for a family member’s firearm that had been reported missing, and that aspect of the case remains under review as part of the ongoing investigation.The renewed search that led to the discovery involved combined teams from the sheriff’s office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Authorities said the area had been searched earlier in the investigation but was revisited after reassessing terrain conditions and visibility concerns.Mendoza Olmos was last seen on the morning of December 24, when a neighbour’s doorbell camera appeared to capture her standing next to her car just before 7 am, outside her home in San Antonio. She was reported missing later that day, prompting a multi-day search in and around her neighbourhood.Sheriff Salazar said Mendoza Olmos had been “going through a tough time” prior to her disappearance, though authorities have not publicly disclosed further details.Authorities say the next steps include formal identification of the body, an autopsy, and toxicology testing to determine the cause and manner of death. Officials have said additional information will be released once forensic work is complete and the family has been fully notified.For now, investigators are urging the public to allow time for the process to unfold, as the community awaits clarity in a case that has deeply affected the neighbourhood and drawn widespread attention across San Antonio and beyond.","Camila Mendoza Olmos, 19, went missing on December 24.

NEW DELHI: The US Embassy in India has shared a year-end recap highlighting major moments that shaped India–US relations in 2025, saying it is looking forward to another year of “even stronger” ties between the two countries.In a post on X, the Embassy wrote, “New year loading… but first, the rewind! Take a look back at the top moments that shaped the US-India partnership this year, while we get ready for another year of even stronger US India ties.”The post was accompanied by a video showcasing key diplomatic engagements and agreements over the past year.The video includes visuals of Prime Minister Narendra Modi meeting US President Donald Trump at the White House during Modi’s visit to Washington in early 2025.The two leaders are seen interacting at the White House, underlining the importance both sides placed on high-level engagement despite a challenging global environment.The montage also features external affairs minister S Jaishankar’s meeting with US secretary of state Marco Rubio on the sidelines of the Quad Foreign Ministers’ Meeting.One of the major highlights shown is the signing of a 10-year update of the Framework for the US–India Major Defence Partnership, reflecting continued cooperation in defence and security.Another key moment in the video is US Vice President JD Vance’s visit to India.

ISLAMABAD: Traders across Pakistan have threatened a nationwide shutdown on January 16 if the government does not withdraw its decision to make the installation of Point of Sale (POS) machines mandatory, warning that the move would further burden small businesses and open new avenues for harassment by tax officials, as reported by Dawn.According to Dawn, the warning came during a protest rally held in Islamabad, where traders attempted to march from Aabpara Chowk towards the Red Zone to demonstrate against the Federal Board of Revenue's (FBR) directive.However, heavy police deployment stopped the procession near the Serena Hotel, forcing demonstrators to hold a sit-in at the spot.The protest was organised by the All Pakistan Anjuman-i-Tajran in collaboration with the Traders Action Committee and drew participation from shopkeepers and market representatives from Islamabad and Rawalpindi.Leaders of various trader bodies addressed the gathering, accusing the government of targeting small businesses instead of addressing large-scale corruption.Addressing the crowd, Ajmal Baloch, president of the Traders Action Committee in Islamabad, described the compulsory installation of POS machines as a ""black law"" designed to intimidate traders rather than reform the tax system.He claimed that under the guise of documentation, traders would be exposed to greater harassment and bribery demands by tax officials.Citing an International Monetary Fund assessment, Baloch alleged that corruption in Pakistan amounts to nearly PKR 53 trillion annually, with the FBR accounting for a major share.He accused the department of selectively targeting small shopkeepers while ignoring large-scale corruption.He also alleged that many FBR officials own assets beyond their known sources of income and that their families enjoy foreign education and luxurious lifestyles.The protest leaders also highlighted alleged irregularities in customs operations, claiming that consignments of legally imported goods had been seized and partially returned, while the rest allegedly disappeared, as highlighted by Dawn.Warning of tougher action ahead, the traders announced that if the government attempted to forcibly install POS machines or seal shops, they would block a major arterial road in Islamabad and stage a sit-in at Zero Point on January 16.They further threatened a countrywide shutdown strike if their demands were ignored.The protesters appealed to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to intervene and protect traders from what they described as arbitrary and heavy-handed actions by tax authorities, as reported by Dawn.","Traders across Pakistan have threatened a nationwide shutdown on January 16 if the government does not withdraw its decision to make the installation of Point of Sale (POS) machines mandatory.

Pakistan army chief field marshal Asim Munir hosted his daughter’s wedding last week in the garrison city of Rawalpindi, where she was married to her first cousin, Abdul Rehman, according to Pakistani media reports.The ceremony was attended by senior political leaders and top military officials but was kept low-key due to security considerations, with no official photographs released.Among those present at the ceremony were Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari, prime minister Shehbaz Sharif, deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar, Punjab chief minister Maryam Nawaz, the chief of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), and several serving and retired senior army officers, including former army chiefs.Pakistani journalist Zahid Gishkori said around 400 guests attended the event, which was deliberately kept subdued.Gishkori, in a video posted on social media platform YouTube, confirmed the family connection between the bride and groom. “Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir's daughter Mahnoor married his brother's son, ex-army captain turned civil servant Abdul Rehman Qasim,” he said.The groom, Abdul Rehman, is Munir’s nephew. According to local media, he previously served in the Pakistan Army as a captain before joining the civil administration through a quota reserved for army officers.He currently serves as an assistant commissioner.Munir has four daughters, and last week's ceremony marked the wedding of his third daughter.The wedding coincided with the arrival of UAE President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan in Pakistan on the same day, prompting speculation on social media about a possible link between the two events. However, Ghiskori said that the UAE president did not attend the wedding.Pakistan’s security and foreign policy under Munir remains critical. A report by Greek City Times said that global patience with Pakistan’s trajectory toward “religious extremism” was wearing thin, alleging that the country had moved toward a more theocratic posture while failing to curb radical elements at home.Another report by Asian News Post criticised Islamabad’s military-led approach to regional diplomacy, particularly in relation to Afghanistan, stating that the strategy had failed to stabilise borders or improve Pakistan’s international standing.","Munir has four daughters, and last week's ceremony marked the wedding of his third daughter.

Pakistan's former spy chief Faiz Hameed challenged his conviction by a military court which had sentenced him to 14 years in jail, media reports said on Monday.Hameed, the former chief of the powerful Inter-Services Intelligence, was convicted on December 11 by a Field General Court Martial (FGCM) on four counts - engaging in political activities, violating the Official Secrets Act, misusing authority and government resources, and causing wrongful loss to individuals.Hameed's lawyer Mian Ali Ashfaq confirmed that the appeal was filed two days ago, The Express Tribune newspaper reported.A separate application has also been submitted to the Court of Appeal's registrar at General Headquarters Pakistan Army, seeking a copy of the written decision, it said.""The appeal has already been filed,"" Ashfaq said, without disclosing the specific grounds raised in the challenge.Hameed was allowed to appeal against the sentence within 40 days, as given under Section 133-B of the Pakistan Army Act.The appeal will be heard by a Court of Appeals headed by a major general or a senior officer nominated by the army chief, who may uphold, modify or set aside the sentence.Hameed is being held at Special Prison Rawalpindi and has not been shifted to Adiala Jail, the report said.His conviction stems from a 2017 complaint filed by a property developer, who alleged that Hameed, then serving as a major general in the ISI, along with two other officers, raided his residence and business premises, confiscated valuables, and forced him to pay Rs 40 million while also funding a private television channel.The matter resurfaced in 2023 when the Supreme Court directed the property developer to approach the defence ministry, which subsequently instituted a Court of Inquiry in April 2024 to probe the allegations, leading to Hameed's arrest on August 12 that year.The FGCM proceedings commenced on August 12, 2024, and continued for around 15 months before the verdict was announced.Hameed retired from military service in November 2022, became the first former ISI director general to be tried by a military court and convicted.

Pakistan FM Ishaq Dar Admits India Hit Nur Khan Air Base In Operation Sindoor Strikes





Pakistan has once again found itself on the defensive after a senior government official publicly acknowledged the impact of India’s precision strikes on a key military installation during the escalation in May, following Operation Sindoor The admission came from Pakistan’s foreign minister and deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, who, during a year-end press briefing on Saturday, confirmed that India had targeted the Nur Khan Air Base in Rawalpindi’s Chaklala area. Dar acknowledged that the strike caused damage to the military installation and injured personnel stationed there.Addressing reporters, Dar said India had launched multiple drone incursions into Pakistani territory within a short span, underlining the scale of the operation. “They (India) send drones towards Pakistan. In 36 hours, at least 80 drones were sent... We were able to intercept 79 drones out of 80, and only one drone damaged a military installation and personnel were also injured in the attack,” he claimed, according to news agency ANI.Also Read: 'Was advised to take shelter in bunker': Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari's big Op Sindoor admission - watch The foreign minister went on to describe the sequence of events following the strikes, saying that Pakistan’s civil and military leadership, led by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, held an emergency meeting on the night of May 9 to respond to the evolving situation.He added that India “made the mistake” of attacking the Nur Khan Air Base in the early hours of May 10, a remark that further acknowledged the strike and its impact.Dar’s comments amount to a rare public admission by a top Pakistani official of India’s military action on Pakistani air bases in May. The strikes came after Operation Sindoor, launched by the Indian Armed Forces to target nine terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir, in retaliation for the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam that killed 26 civilians.The Pakistan Air Force’s Nur Khan Air Base in Chaklala suffered significant damage during the Indian precision strikes. India had launched Operation Sindoor in the early hours of May 7 as a direct response to the Pahalgam attack.The escalation that followed saw increased cross-border shelling by Pakistan and retaliatory action by Indian forces. The situation later took an unexpected turn when Pakistan’s Director General of Military Operations contacted his Indian counterpart to propose a ceasefire, which India accepted. The outreach from the Pakistani side was later confirmed by Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri, who said both sides agreed to halt all military operations on land, at sea and in the air.Satellite imagery released by Maxar Technologies on May 13 showed significant damage to multiple Pakistani air bases, including Nur Khan Air Base. The images revealed damage at four installations: Nur Khan Air Base in Rawalpindi, PAF Base Mushaf in Sargodha, Bholari Air Base and PAF Base Shahbaz in Jacobabad. A comparison of satellite images taken on April 25 and May 10 showed clear damage to air base facilities, corroborating the strikes.This is not the first time a senior Pakistani leader has acknowledged the attack on Nur Khan Air Base. In May, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif admitted that Indian ballistic missiles had hit the base and other locations, breaking from Pakistan’s usual practice of denying Indian military action.Addressing a ceremony at the Pakistan Monument on May 16, Sharif said, “At around 2:30 am on May 10, General Syed Asim Munir called me on a secure line and informed me that India's ballistic missiles had hit Nur Khan Airbase and other areas. Our Air Force used homegrown technology to save our country, and they even used modern gadgets and technology on Chinese jets,” Geo News reported.",Pakistan FM Ishaq Dar Admits India Hit Nur Khan Air Base In Operation Sindoor Strikes.

(With ANI inputs)





NEW DELHI: Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari admitted that he was urged to take shelter in a bunker for his safety during the four-day confrontation with India in May, a remark that underscored India’s prowess to strike deep into mainland Pakistan.According to Zardari, the advice came from his military secretary, though he claimed he refused to take shelter.“I had actually told him (secretary) four days earlier that a war was going to happen. But he came to me and said, ‘Sir, let’s go to the bunkers.’ I replied, ‘If martyrdom is to come, it will come here. Leaders don’t die in bunkers; they die on the battlefield. They don’t die sitting in bunkers,’” Zardari said on Saturday at a rally marking the death anniversary of his wife and former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, who was assassinated in 2007.He added that every worker of his Pakistan Peoples Party was ready to sacrifice his life for the nation.Zardari also responded to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “roti khao, varna meri goli toh hai hi” (eat your food peacefully, or else my bullet is waiting for you) warning to Pakistan, saying that it would be Pakistan that would fire the bullets.He further remarked that India may have an economy 10 times larger than Pakistan’s, but questioned where it would find the “courage” to fight a war.Indian armed forces launched Operation Sindoor on the intervening night of May 6–7 in retaliation for the Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 civilians. The strikes targeted nine terror facilities in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.Pakistan responded to the operation, triggering further retaliation by Indian forces, which subsequently struck around a dozen Pakistani air force bases.On May 10, Pakistan’s Director General of Military Operations contacted his Indian counterpart seeking a ceasefire, which was accepted.India has consistently maintained that Operation Sindoor has only been “halted” and would be resumed in the future if required.","Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari admitted that he was urged to take shelter in a bunker for his safety during the four-day confrontation with India in May.

Trump Puts Asim Munir On Gaza Test: Can Pak Army Chief Appease U.S & Avoid Backlash At Home?

Former Imran Khan aide Shahzad Akbar attacked in UK





Pakistan on Friday summoned Britain’s deputy high commissioner Matt Cannell after a video circulated online showing a woman at a rally in the UK referring to a possible attack on Pakistan Army chief General Asim Munir The ministry of foreign affairs called in Cannell to lodge a formal protest and demanded an investigation after the woman, speaking at a rally in Bradford in northern England, mentioned the possibility of the army chief being killed in a car bombing. Pakistani officials said the remarks went beyond political expression and raised serious security concerns.The rally was held in support of Pakistan’s jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan and was attended by his supporters living in the UK. Khan was removed from office through a no-confidence vote in April 2022 and has been in prison for nearly two years.The Bradford protest came days after a special court of Pakistan’s Federal Investigation Agency sentenced Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, to 17 years in prison each in the Toshakhana-II corruption case.According to Dawn, the court also imposed a fine of Pakistani Rs 16.4 million on each of them, with additional jail time possible in case of non-payment. The case relates to the alleged illegal retention and sale of state gifts received while Khan was in office.The video from the Bradford rally was initially shared on X by the UK chapter of Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party before being deleted.Explaining the decision, PTI UK said in a post on X: “We have removed a video from the recent Bradford protest featuring a citizen’s metaphorical remarks regarding General Asim Munir. Although we do not believe the individual incited violence, the post was deleted in an abundance of caution to prevent potential misunderstanding and legal safeguarding of the individual and her rights.”Pakistan’s deputy interior minister Talal Chaudhry said the remarks crossed a red line. Speaking to Geo Television, he said: “While Imran Khan’s party has been inciting supporters against the military, the car bomb threat at the Bradford rally crossed all limits. It does not fall into the category of freedom of speech.”He urged the UK government to investigate the incident and take legal action if laws were violated.Responding to Pakistan’s concerns, the UK High Commission in Islamabad said in a brief statement: “Where a foreign Government believes a crime has been committed, they should provide all relevant material to their UK police liaison. Any material that appears to break UK law will be reviewed by the police and may lead to a criminal investigation.”The diplomatic move comes amid escalating tensions between Khan’s supporters and Pakistan’s powerful military. Earlier this month, army spokesperson Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry described Khan as “mentally ill” during a press conference, after posts on Khan’s official X account referred to General Munir as “mentally unstable,” according to the Associated Press.Separately, tensions escalated further after PTI said Shahzad Akbar, a former adviser to Imran Khan was attacked in the United Kingdom on Thursday.In a post on X, Akbar said he was assaulted outside his home in Cambridge by an unidentified man.“Yesterday at approximately 8:08 a.m., I was attacked at my home by an unknown assailant dressed in what appeared to be construction or waste-collection attire,” Akbar wrote. “The individual asked, ‘Are you Shahzad Akbar?’ and immediately began assaulting me. The incident occurred in the presence of my family.”Akbar said he sustained facial injuries, including bruising and a fractured nose, and was taken to a local hospital before being discharged.“The police have taken cognizance of the matter and have assured me and my family that they are actively investigating this targeted attack and will work to apprehend both the perpetrator and those behind it,” he said.He added that he could not share further details at this stage, including CCTV footage, on the advice of authorities.“I have full faith in the rule of law and in British law enforcement to carry out their duties,” Akbar said, urging the UK government to ensure the safety of dissidents.In a follow-up statement, Akbar said the attack would not silence him.“I want to make one thing absolutely clear: If my views, political comments, or even my ‘face’ is not liked by anyone, such cowardly acts will only strengthen my resolve rather than silence me,” he wrote. “Violence will not intimidate me or deter me from speaking out.”The Pakistan government has previously submitted extradition documents to British authorities seeking Akbar’s return.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan’s nuclear proliferation programme triggered deep concern at the highest levels of the United States and Russia, with both countries expressing that Islamabad’s nuclear activities made them “nervous”, according to newly declassified documents released by the US National Security Archive.The documents, made public this week following a Freedom of Information lawsuit, include verbatim transcripts of meetings and phone calls between former US president George W Bush and Russian president Vladimir Putin between 2001 and 2008. They reveal repeated discussions on Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal, links to Iran’s nuclear programme, and the role of the AQ Khan proliferation network.In a key Oval Office meeting in 2005, Putin raised concerns over evidence suggesting Pakistani-origin uranium had been found in Iranian centrifuges, questioning Western tolerance of Islamabad despite its proliferation record.“But it's not clear what the labs (Iran) have, where they are. Cooperation with Pakistan still exists,” Putin said during the meeting.Bush responded by referring to his discussions with then Pakistani president Pervez Musharraf, saying, “I talked to Musharraf about that. I told him we're worried about transfers to Iran and North Korea. They put AQ Khan in jail, and some of his buddies under house arrest. We want to know what they said.I keep reminding Musharraf of that. Either he's getting nothing, or he's not being forthcoming.”Putin reiterated his concerns, stating, “As far as I understand, they found uranium of Pakistani origin in the centrifuges.”Bush acknowledged the issue, saying, “Yes, the stuff the Iranians forgot to tell the IAEA about. That's a violation.”“It was of Pakistani origin. That makes me nervous,” Putin said, to which Bush replied, “It makes us nervous, too.”Also read: 'I want Pak': Rajnath recalls Vajpayee's unmatched wit; all about iconic moment The documents also highlight Putin’s blunt assessment of Pakistan during an earlier meeting with Bush in Slovenia in 2001. “I am concerned about Pakistan. It is just a junta with nuclear weapons. It is no democracy, yet the West makes no criticism of it. Should talk about it,” Putin said.According to the transcripts, both leaders expressed anxiety about Pakistan’s internal political instability, its military-led governance under Musharraf, and the risk that sensitive nuclear technology could fall into the wrong hands. The discussions repeatedly returned to the AQ Khan network, which was later confirmed to have supplied nuclear technology to Iran, North Korea, and Libya.The declassified records underscore longstanding international concerns about Pakistan’s nuclear command and control systems and the broader implications of its proliferation activities.The revelations come amid renewed scrutiny of Pakistan’s nuclear conduct. Last month, India criticised Islamabad following remarks by US President Donald Trump alleging that Pakistan had been secretly testing nuclear weapons.Reacting to Trump’s comments, Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said such actions were consistent with Pakistan’s history. “Clandestine and illegal nuclear activities are in keeping with Pakistan's history, which is centred around decades of smuggling, export control violations, secret partnerships, AQ Khan network and further proliferation,” he said.“India has always drawn the attention of the international community to these aspects of Pakistan's record,” Jaiswal added."," transcripts of meetings and phone calls between former US president George W Bush and Russian president Vladimir Putin released by US National Security Archive.

Pak PM Sharif's Party Leader Threatens India, Warns Missiles Will Respond If Bangladesh Is Targeted





In a sharp attack on Pakistan’s security establishment, Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman accused the military leadership of employing a “double standard” regarding cross-border military operations. Speaking at a recent gathering in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the influential Deobandi cleric questioned the logical consistency of Pakistan’s defence policy, specifically contrasting Islamabad’s recent strikes in Afghanistan with its diplomatic outrage over Indian activities within Pakistani borders.He asked Pakistan’s military brass why India’s actions inside Pakistan should be condemned when Islamabad justifies strikes in Afghanistan by calling them attacks on its enemies. Rehman argued that if Pakistan claimed a sovereign right to launch pre-emptive or retaliatory strikes against perceived enemies on Afghan soil, it weakened its moral and legal standing when protesting similar actions by India. “We sent militants to Afghanistan for 20 years. .. from giving them Kalashnikovs to Cruise missiles... we empowered them in every way. When you bombed Kabul, it was as if someone had bombed your Islamabad.This is the limit, isn’t it? If you had bombed the remote areas, you might have been able to tolerate it. So, you took some action there as well...”“...If you say, and I have questions, that we have attacked the enemy’s headquarters and you call this a legitimate statement, India says to you that it has attacked Bahawalpur, it has attacked Muridke, it has attacked the headquarters of those who are operating against us in Kashmir. Why are you objecting to this? And if you object to this, and if you have the same claims against Afghanistan, how will you justify it..?”Rehman’s criticism comes at a time when Pakistan’s Field Marshal Asim Munir continues his anti-India rhetoric and claims that Pakistan received “divine help” during the military confrontation with India in May which was felt during the days of intense fighting that followed Indian strikes on terror targets.Rehman’s comments touch upon a sensitive nerve in geopolitics, specifically referring to locations like Bahawalpur and Muridke — areas long identified as hubs for terrorist groups like JeM and LeT — which were decimated during Operation Sindoor.

US President Donald Trump has assured that his administration will set the ""highest possible bar for aviation safety"" in the country after Washington DC plane crash that killed 67 on Wednesday.Further, he criticized diversity efforts at the federal aviation administration, claiming they lowered standards for air traffic controllers. He accused the Barack Obama administration of deciding the FAA workforce was ""too white"" and also blamed the Joe Biden administration and transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg.Officials have recovered the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder, commonly known as black boxes, from the American Airlines plane, CBS News reported.The collision occurred at around 9pm (local time) within restricted airspace, about three miles from the White House and the US Capitol. By Thursday morning, authorities had transitioned from a search-and-rescue operation to a recovery effort.Trump said that there were some ""very strong opinions and ideas"" that might have led to the crash. He said that FAA and the NTSB and the US military would be investigating the matter.We do not know what led to this crash, but we have some very strong opinions and ideas, and I think we'll probably state those opinions now because over the years I've watched as things like this happen and they say, 'Well, we're always investigating,'"" he said.""And then the investigation, three years later, they announce it. 'We think we have some pretty good ideas.' But we'll find out how this disaster occurred and will ensure that nothing like this ever happens again,"" he added.Trump blamed diversity requirements at the FAA and his Democratic predecessors for the crash, claiming lax standards for air traffic controllers played a role. However, he provided no evidence linking diversity programs to the crash.""For some jobs, we need the highest level of genius,"" he said.""The FAA's diversity push includes focus on hiring people with severe intellectual and psychiatric disabilities. That is amazing. And then it says, FAA says, people with severe disabilities are most underrepresented segment of the workforce and they want them in and they want them . They can be air traffic controllers. I don't think so. This was in January 14th, so that was a week before I entered office. They put a big push to put diversity into the FAA's program,"" he said.When asked how he had drawn this conclusion, Trump replied: ""Because I have common sense. OK? And unfortunately, a lot of people don't. We want brilliant people doing this. This is a major chess game at the highest level. When you have 60 planes coming in during a short period of time, and they're all coming in different directions, and you're dealing with very high-level computer, computer work and very complex computers.""The US president claimed that ever since Federal Aviation Administration was being overseen by secretary Pete Buttigieg, the aviation safety had become a ""disaster.""""That's the guy's a real winner. Do you know how badly everything's run since he's run this Department of Transportation? He's a disaster. He was a disaster as a mayor. He ran his city into the ground and he's a disaster now,"" he said.""He's just got a good line of bullshit. The Department of Transportation, his government agency charged with regulating civil aviation while he runs it, 45,000 people and he is run it right into the ground with his diversity. So I had to say that it's terrible,"" he added.Trump claimed that he Obama-era aviation standards were ""very mediocre"" and he changed them to ""extraordinary"" when he took over in 2016.""We must have only the highest standards for those who work in our aviation system. I changed the Obama standards from very mediocre at best to extraordinary. You remember that. Only the highest aptitude, they have to be the highest intellect and psychologically superior people were allowed to qualify for air traffic controllers. That was not so prior to getting there,"" he said.""When I arrived in 2016, I made that change very early on because I always felt this was a job that -- and other jobs too- but this was a job that had to be superior intelligence and we didn't really have that and we had it,"" he added.He then claimed that Joe Biden's presidency since 2020 changed changed the aviation standards ""back to lower than ever before.""""I put safety first, Obama Biden and the Democrats put policy first and they put politics at a level that nobody's ever seen because this was the lowest level. Their policy was horrible and their politics was even worse. So as you know, last week long before the crash, I signed an executive order restoring our highest standards for air traffic controllers and other important jobs throughout the country,"" he said.Trump said that he had signed executive orders to ensure ""highest possible bar for aviation safety"".""About a week ago, almost upon entering office, I signed something last week, that was an executive order, very powerful on restoring the highest standards of air traffic controllers and others, by the way. Then my administration will set the highest possible bar for aviation safety,"" he said.""We have to have our smartest people. It doesn't matter what they look like, how they speak, who they are. It matters - intellect, talent. The word talent. You have to be talented, naturally talented geniuses. You can't have regular people doing that job. They won't be able to do it,"" he added.Talking about the crash, Trump said we had ""a confluence of bad decisions that were made and you have people that lost their lives, violently lost their lives.""""So you had a helicopter going in identical direction. You had a helicopter that was at the exact same height as somebody going in essentially the opposite direction. You had a plane that was following a track, which is a track that every other plane followed and I don't imagine, I know I've heard today that they might've been following the preceding plane, which was pretty close, but not that close, the preceding plane. But you wouldn't have even been able to see that because of the direction that the helicopter was coming in at,"" he said.Trump expressed that having Sean Duffy sworn in as the new transportation secretary was timely.Answering a question on Duffy being confirmed as transportation secretary, he said: ""For sure, we want fast confirmations. And the Democrats, as you know, are doing everything they can to delay. They've taken too long. We're struggling to get very good people that everybody knows are going to be confirmed. But we're struggling to get them out faster. We want them out faster.""""This was a dark and excruciating night in our nation's capital and in our nation's history and a tragedy of terrible proportions. As one nation, we grieve for every precious soul that has been taken from us so suddenly, and we are a country of really, we are in mourning. This is really shaking a lot of people, including people very sadly, from other nations who were on the flight,"" he said.""On behalf of the First Lady, myself and 340 million Americans, our friends are shattered alongside yours and our prayers are with you now and in the days to come. We'll be working very, very diligently in the days to come. We're here for you to wipe away the tears and to offer you our devotion, our love and our support. It's great support. In moments like this, the differences between Americans fade to nothing compared to the bonds of affection and loyalty that unite us all, both as Americans and even as nations. We are one family, and today we are all heartbroken. We're all searching for answers,"" he added.Trump assured people that it was safe to fly and they shouldn't feel hesitant to do so.""No. Not at all. I would not hesitate to fly. This is something that it's been many years that something like this has happened, and the collision is just something that, we don't expect ever to happen again,"" he said""Flying is very safe. We have the safest flying anywhere in the world, and we'll keep it that way,"" he added.","US President Donald Trump has assured that his administration will set the ""highest possible bar for aviation safety"" in the country.

He also indicated that the administration is considering similar measures against China.Speaking to the reporters in the Oval Office of the White House, Trump asserted that, ""I will be putting the tariff of 25 per cent on Canada and, separately, 25 per cent on Mexico. We will really have to do that because we have very big deficits with those countries. Those tariffs may or may not rise with time.""""Mexico and Canada have never been good to us on trade,"" the President said, while adding that both nations have treated the US ""very unfairly"" on trade.""We will be announcing tariffs on Canada and Mexico for several reasons,"" Trump stated, citing unauthorised immigration, drug trafficking, and significant US financial support to both countries through trade deficits as key justifications for the move.When questioned, Trump stated he would conclude Thursday night (local time), whether oil would be included amongst tariffed items.""We're going to make that determination probably tonight on oil. Because they send us oil...It depends on what the price is. If the oil is properly priced, if they treat us properly, which they don't,"" he said.He emphasised that the US could recover ""very quickly,"" stating that it ""does not need"" the products imported from Canada and Mexico.""We have all the oil you need. We have all the trees you need, meaning the lumber. We have more than almost anybody in those two categories. In oil, we have more than anybody,"" the 47th president of the US said.""We don't need anybody's trees, we have great lumber in this country. We have to free them up environmentally, which I can do very quickly,"" he added.""We don't need what they have. For us to be subsidising Canada to the tune of $175 billion a year, and subsidising Mexico to the tune of $250 billion-$300 billion a year,"" he further continued.Regarding China, Trump indicated the possibility of punitive measures against China over its role in fentanyl exports to the US.""Because of that, they're causing us hundreds of thousands of deaths. China is going to end up paying a tariff also for that. We are in the process of doing that. We'll make that determination of what it's going to be,"" he said.""China has to stop sending fentanyl into our country and killing our people,"" Trump added.

US President Donald Trump on Thursday responded sarcastically when asked if he would visit the plane crash site over the Potomac River in Washington, asking reporters, ""You want me to go swimming?""The deadly mid-air crash between a jet and a military helicopter took place on Wednesday night. The incident is presumed to have claimed all 67 lives on board. According to a report from CNN citing sources, more than 40 bodies have been recovered from the river as of Thursday afternoon.When the reporters at the White House asked whether he would visit the site, Trump responded, ""I have a plan to visit, not the site. Because you tell me, what's the site? The water? You want me to go swimming?""His comments were quickly condemned on social media, with many calling them insensitive and inappropriate in the wake of such a tragedy.""67 people die under his watch, and he makes a joke? Callous, heartless, completely lacking in empathy,"" one user wrote.""We are such a profoundly unserious country sometimes,"" another added.Despite the ongoing investigation into the cause of the crash, Trump was quick to blame former President Joe Biden and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. He signed an executive order titled ""Immediate Assessment of Aviation Safety,"" arguing that DEI policies compromise competency in crucial roles.""We want the most competent people,"" Trump said. ""We don't care what race they are. We want the most competent people, especially in those positions. You're talking about extremely complex things, and if they don't have a great brain, a great power of the brain, they're not going to be very good at what they do and bad things will happen.""When pressed for evidence linking DEI policies to the crash, Trump admitted he had no specifics but insisted his belief was based on ""common sense.""Trump also announced plans to meet with families of the victims but did not specify when. ""I will be meeting with some people that were very badly hurt with their family members, obviously, but I'll be meeting with some of the families, yeah,"" he said.Meanwhile, recovery operations at the crash site were paused Thursday evening due to diminishing daylight and challenging conditions in the water.

But that's supposition.

Donald Trump's foreign aid suspension hits Pakistan: How it will impact key sectors,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trumps-foreign-aid-suspension-hits-pakistan-how-it-will-impact-key-sectors/articleshow/117733040.cms,"Immediate impact on key sectors



US policy shift and review timeline



Economic and social consequences for Pakistan



Geopolitical ramifications



Uncertain future for development initiatives



NEW DELHI: Donald Trump has temporarily suspended United States foreign assistance to foreign countries, including Pakistan, for re-evaluation, putting several critical development projects on hold.The decision follows an executive order issued by President Donald Trump, directing a comprehensive review of US foreign aid spending.The US aid suspension is set to impact several key sectors in Pakistan, including energy, economic growth, agriculture, governance, education, health, and cultural preservation. Projects such as the Power Sector Improvement Activity, Pakistan Private Sector Energy Initiative, and Clean Energy Loan Portfolio Guarantee Program face disruptions in the energy sector, as per a Geo news report.Economic growth initiatives, including the Social Protection Activity and Pakistan Private Investment Initiative, may also suffer setbacks. In agriculture, programmes like Water Management for Enhanced Productivity and Recharge Pakistan risk losing funding.The suspension has stalled numerous USAID-funded projects across various sectors, including health, education, agriculture, energy, and governance. The move halts initiatives such as the Ambassadors Fund for Cultural Preservation (AFCP), the Power Sector Improvement Activity, and the Pakistan Private Sector Energy Activity. Economic growth initiatives, such as the Social Protection Activity and Investment Promotion Activity, are also affected.In the education sector, projects aimed at improving girls' education, strengthening higher education systems, and enhancing resilience in Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have been disrupted. The health sector has also taken a hit, with the suspension of tuberculosis treatment programmes, family health initiatives, and global health security efforts.Tammy Bruce, a spokesperson for the US Department of State, confirmed that all foreign aid funded by the State Department and USAID is under review. Secretary of State Marco Rubio justified the move, stating that every aid dollar must contribute to American security, strength, and prosperity.The White House has clarified that the suspension is temporary, with a 90-day review period. The final decision will be made by the relevant departments in consultation with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).The suspension of aid threatens Pakistan’s development trajectory, particularly in regions relying on US-funded initiatives for stability and growth. The decision could delay infrastructural advancements, limit economic opportunities, and disrupt healthcare access for vulnerable populations.Pakistan’s governance and democracy-building programmes are also affected, including projects on electoral reforms, land registration, and local governance. The decision may weaken institutional development efforts and impede progress in human rights and civic participation.The suspension highlights a shift in US-Pakistan relations , with Washington reassessing its financial commitments to Islamabad. Analysts believe this could push Pakistan to seek alternative funding sources, possibly from China or Gulf nations, altering its geopolitical alliances.While the pause in aid does not signify a complete severance of US-Pakistan ties, it raises concerns about future diplomatic engagements and financial support from Washington. The upcoming review will determine whether these programmes will resume, be modified, or face permanent cuts.With crucial projects now in limbo, Pakistani officials and aid-dependent communities await the US review’s outcome. The next three months will be critical in determining whether Washington reinstates its financial commitments or signals a long-term reduction in aid to Pakistan.For now, the suspension leaves Pakistan navigating an uncertain future, with potential setbacks in economic growth, infrastructure development, and humanitarian assistance.","Donald Trump has temporarily suspended United States foreign assistance to foreign countries, including Pakistan.

Robinhood Markets, Inc, which offers a trading platform for digital currencies, contributed $2 million, according to the reports.Once a crypto skeptic, Trump enthusiastically embraced the industry as an investor, entrepreneur and source of political fundraising. Among large donors to his campaign and super political action committee were venture capitalists Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz and billionaire twins Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss.In his first week in office, the president tapped David Sacks, the venture capitalist he named as his crypto czar, to head a task force that includes top cabinet officials to promote US digital financial technology. They’re to consider regulatory reform and creating a digital asset stockpile.Trump, who’s expected to easily surpass the $107 million he raised for his 2017 inauguration, received donations from other industries expecting more favorable policies from his administration. Chevron Corp. gave $2 million, a much heftier gift than the $525,000 it contributed for his first inauguration. Oklo Inc., which makes fission reactors that can run on nuclear waste, gave $250,000. Chris Wright, Trump’s pick to run the Energy department, sat on its board.Companies in the renewable energy business also donated. Hanwha Q Cells America Inc., the US subsidiary of the German solar panel maker, gave $500,000, as did GE Vernova, a General Electric spinoff that manufactures everything from gas turbines to blades for wind power. The American Clean Power Association, a trade group that represents wind, solar, clean hydrogen and transmission companies, gave $100,000.Among the flurry of executive orders he issued to start his term, Trump froze permits to new offshore wind power installations, a major setback for the industry, and invoked emergency powers in a bid to bolster domestic energy production.His inaugural committee also received money from many donors who didn’t give the first time around. They include some who had earlier acknowledged they were doing so, such as Amazon.com Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., who each gave $1 million. Other new donors that gave that amount include health-care companies Bayer Corporation and Johnson & Johnson.The disclosures offer a partial glimpse into some of the moneyed interests who paid hefty sums to help welcome Trump back to Washington. Organizations with in-house lobbyists are required to semiannually disclose their political contributions.Trump’s inaugural committee isn’t due to release its complete list of donors to the Federal Election Commission until April 19.","Coinbase Inc, Crypto.com, Galaxy Digital, Paradigm Operations and Payward Inc, better known as Kraken, each gave $1 million.

(AP)

Here are some takeaways from her confirmation hearing



Gabbard grilled on past meeting with Syria's Assad

Gabbard on Snowden

Democrats question Gabbard's statements on Russia

US Senators from both parties, Democrats and Republicans, questioned Tulsi Gabbard , President Donald Trump’s nominee for director of national intelligence , during her confirmation hearing on Thursday. The discussion was tense at times, suggesting that her confirmation may not be easy.For more than two hours, members of the Senate Intelligence Committee asked Gabbard about her 2017 meeting with Bashar Assad, the former leader of Syria, and her past statements blaming the United States and Nato for provoking Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022.Also read: Is Hindu-American Tulsi Gabbard of Indian origin? One of the main concerns for both Republicans and Democrats was her position on Edward Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor who leaked classified information about government surveillance programs in 2013.When asked repeatedly if Snowden was a ""traitor,"" Gabbard did not directly answer. Instead, she said that he ""broke the law"" and that she would work to prevent future leaks if confirmed. She also said that Snowden ""exposed egregious, illegal and unconstitutional programs that are happening within our government.""Former Democratic congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, who ran for president in 2020 before leaving the party and endorsing Trump in 2024, also faced questions about her past remarks on Russia's war in Ukraine. She has been accused of repeating Russian propaganda to justify Putin's invasion.During the hearing, Senator Michael Bennet read some of Gabbard's previous comments, including her statement that Putin had ""legitimate security concerns"" over Nato expansion in Eastern Europe. Bennet said this suggested she believed a ""totalitarian state"" was ""justified in rolling over the peaceful border of Ukraine.""He also pointed out that Russian state TV aired her remarks and referred to her as ""our friend Tulsi.""Gabbard, a lieutenant colonel in the National Guard who served in the Middle East, has no formal intelligence experience.Several committee members appeared dissatisfied with her responses.It is unclear how many Republicans might vote against her. If all Democrats oppose her nomination, even one Republican voting no in the committee could prevent her confirmation from reaching the full Senate.Gabbard does not have a traditional background for leading the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which was established after the September 11, 2001, attacks to improve coordination among intelligence agencies, including the CIA and FBI.She was once viewed as aligned with the political left but has since held a range of political positions, leading some to question her current views.Her supporters highlighted her military service, including her time in the Iraq War, as evidence of her qualifications for the role.","Tulsi Gabbard is President Donald Trump's nominee for director of national intelligence.

Past fatal air crashes

A jet carrying 60 passengers and four crew members collided with a US Army helicopter while approaching Ronald Reagan National Airport near Washington, DC Both aircraft fell into the Potomac River, and no one survived.The collision took place around 9 pm (local time) on Wednesday, in an area with restricted airspace about three miles from the White House and US Capitol. By Thursday morning, the search-and-rescue operation had shifted to a recovery effort. The cause of the crash is still unknown.Officials have retrieved the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder, commonly known as black boxes, from the American Airlines plane, CBS News said.These recorders could provide insights into what happened during the flight. According to CBS, the National Transportation Safety Board will analyze them at a lab near the crash site.The US Federal Aviation Administration reported that the crash involved a regional jet from Wichita, Kansas, preparing to land, and a military helicopter carrying three soldiers on a training exercise. Weather conditions were clear.As the jet neared the airport, air traffic controllers asked American Airlines Flight 5342 if it could land on a shorter runway, and the pilots agreed. The plane adjusted its approach, and controllers cleared it to land.Less than 30 seconds before impact, a controller asked the helicopter crew if they could see the plane. Moments later, another message instructed the helicopter to let the jet pass. There was no response before the aircraft collided.Flight tracking data indicated that the jet’s transponder stopped transmitting about 2,400 feet short of the runway, roughly above the middle of the Potomac River. Officials found the jet upside-down in three sections in waist-deep water. The helicopter’s wreckage was also recovered from the river.Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) are working to retrieve data recording devices from both aircraft.US Federal investigators will examine communications between the aircraft and air traffic controllers, pilot actions, and flight altitudes.News agency Associated Press, quoting an FAA report, said that only one controller was handling helicopter and airplane traffic at the time. Usually, two controllers are assigned, but workstations are sometimes combined during shift changes, breaks, or when air traffic is low.President Donald Trump , transportation secretary Sean Duffy , and secretary of the Army nominee Daniel Driscoll said the crash appeared preventable.Trump blamed diversity efforts at the Federal Aviation Administration for lowering standards for air traffic controllers. He blamed the Obama administration, claiming it had determined that the FAA workforce was ""too white.""He blamed the Biden administration, too, and its secretary of transportation, Pete Buttigieg .""That guy is a real winner,"" Trump said, sarcastically. ""He's a disaster.""US President Donald Trump claimed, without evidence, that diversity initiatives had weakened air safety and questioned the actions of a US Army helicopter pilot involved in the midair collision with a commercial jet.Officials have not yet determined the cause of the crash, and Trump acknowledged it was too early to draw conclusions. However, while calling on the country to pray for the victims, he also speculated on the incident and made political statements, a time when presidents are usually expected to provide reassurance and factual updates.“Some really bad things happened and some things happened that shouldn’t have happened,"" Trump said from the White House briefing room, located a few miles from the crash site.He blamed former President Joe Biden’s administration for pushing the FAA to hire workers under diversity and inclusion policies. He claimed this led to the hiring of people with intellectual disabilities, psychiatric conditions, hearing and vision impairments, epilepsy, paralysis, and dwarfism.Trump did not provide any proof that unqualified individuals were placed in key positions like air traffic control. He also admitted there was no evidence that controllers at Reagan National Airport had made any errors.When asked why he was blaming diversity policies, Trump responded, ""because I have common sense, and unfortunately a lot of people don’t.”This was the deadliest US air crash in nearly 24 years. 28 bodies have been recovered so far, including those of the three soldiers on the helicopter.Among the passengers were members of the Skating Club of Boston returning from a development camp following the 2025 US Figure Skating Championships in Wichita. Fourteen members of the skating community were on the plane, including teenage figure skaters Jinna Han and Spencer Lane , their mothers, and two coaches, Evgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov , who were world champions in 1994.Three students and six parents from Fairfax County, Virginia, were also on board.Army aviation chief Jonathan Koziol said the helicopter crew was experienced and familiar with flying in Washington’s congested airspace. Their names have not been released.Reagan National Airport is located along the Potomac River, southwest of Washington. It is a preferred airport due to its proximity to the city. Operations resumed on Thursday after being halted following the crash.Transportation secretary Sean Duffy said the flight paths of both aircraft before the crash were typical for the area.""I would just say that everyone who flies in American skies expects that we fly safely,” he said. “That when you depart an airport, you get to your destination. That didn’t happen last night, and I know that President Trump, his administration, the FAA, the DOT, we will not rest until we have answers for the families and for the flying public.”Federal authorities and aviation experts have raised concerns about rising close calls between planes. In May, an American Airlines plane at Reagan aborted takeoff to avoid a collision with another aircraft landing on an intersecting runway. This was the second such incident at the airport in six weeks.The military helicopter was a UH-60 Black Hawk based at Fort Belvoir, Virginia.The jet was a Bombardier CRJ-701, built in Canada in 2004. It had twin engines and could carry up to 70 passengers.Fatal commercial plane crashes in the US are rare. The last major incident occurred in 2009 near Buffalo, New York, when a Bombardier DHC-8 crashed into a house, killing all 45 passengers, four crew members, and one person on the ground.In November 2001, an American Airlines flight crashed in a New York neighborhood shortly after taking off from Kennedy Airport, killing all 260 people on board.The crash on Wednesday was similar to the 1982 Air Florida disaster, where a plane crashed into the Potomac River, killing 78 people. That crash was caused by bad weather.","A jet carrying 60 passengers and four crew members collided with a US Army helicopter while approaching Ronald Reagan National Airport near Washington, DC.

WASHINGTON: Sixty seven people were feared dead after an American Airlines passenger jet collided with a US Army Black Hawk helicopter on Wednesday night and crashed into the frigid Potomac River near Reagan Washington National Airport.Sixty passengers and four crew members were aboard the jet flying from Wichita in Kansas, while the chopper was carrying three soldiers on an annual proficiency training flight.The crash site was reported to be barely miles from White House and Pentagon.""We have been told there are no survivors,"" Wichita mayor Lily Wu said. Twenty eight bodies had been recovered from the river till reports last came in.It's not known what led to the crash - the deadliest US air disaster since Nov 12, 2001 - considering radio communications between ATC and the Black Hawk showed its crew knew the plane was in the vicinity. ""Everything was standard in the lead-up to the crash,"" US transportation secretary Sean Duffy said. ""Do I think this was preventable? Absolutely.""The US army helicopter that collided with a passenger jet was being operated on a training flight by a ""fairly experienced crew"" with night-vision goggles, US defence secretary Pete Hegseth said on Thursday, as the Pentagon ordered a 48-hour pause in flying for the Virginia-based unit involved. In addition, Daniel Driscoll, President Trump's nominee for army secretary, told a Senate hearing that the crash appears to have been preventable, and he raised questions about whether training should take place near a busy airport. Hegseth saidthat there appears to have been an elevation issue with the Black Hawk, and said army investigators were on the ground looking into the matter.

Trump during his inauguration said, ""above all, China is operating the Panama Canal,"" while claiming that US vessels faced unfair treatment and excessive charges.Mulino, at his Thursday press briefing, attempted to ease tensions by addressing misconceptions about Chinese involvement in the canal. He clarified that while a Hong Kong consortium manages the terminal ports, Panama maintains control of the waterway. He also attributed the establishment of diplomatic ties with China to a previous administration.The canal, constructed by the United States in the early 1900s to facilitate coastal maritime transit, was transferred to Panamanian control on December 31, 1999, following a treaty signed by President Jimmy Carter in 1977.","Mulino attempted to ease tensions by addressing misconceptions about Chinese involvement in the canal.

These symptoms typically occurred after experiencing loud sounds accompanied by severe discomfort in their ears and head.These incidents weren't isolated to this group. Additional American citizens have reported comparable health issues.""Havana Syndrome"" received its name from media outlets due to the initial cluster of reported cases in Cuba. Subsequently, similar incidents have been documented across multiple nations—including Austria, China, Colombia, Georgia, Germany, India, Poland, Russia, Vietnam, and within the United States mainland.Those affected primarily were federal staff working in intelligence operations and various government departments, along with their family members. Incidents occurred at their workplaces, homes, and during regular travel.Although symptoms varied amongst individuals, some cases resulted in enduring problems affecting cognitive function, sensory processing, and equilibrium.According to a 2022 CIA intelligence assessment , the unexplained physiological symptoms experienced by diplomats were not attributed to a coordinated effort by any hostile nation.A subsequent intelligence community evaluation revealed that two out of seven intelligence agencies now suggest the possibility that a foreign entity might have created or utilised a device responsible for these unexplained health incidents.","Donald Trump's pick for Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said she looks forward to addressing the reported Havana syndrome case during her confirmation hearing.

Marri brought attention to the Pakiststate's systematic exploitation, enforced disappearances, and violence against various ethnic communities.""The sufferings of the Baloch and Pashtun under Pakistan's occupation are countless and unending,"" Marri stated, emphasizing the urgent need for unity between the two nations to resist colonial oppression.He recalled previous instances of solidarity, such as the treaty of kalat in 1758, in which Afghan and Baloch leaders promised to respect and support one another. He asked both groups to rekindle this spirit in their struggle for independence.Marri compared British imperialism to the colonial strategies that Pakistan acquired. He denounced Pakistan's continuous military actions in Balochistan , pointing to unlawful executions, torture, and enforced disappearances as means of quelling dissent. The Baloch leader cited the targeted profiling of Pashtuns and killings like the 1948 Barbra event in Charsadda, claiming that these practices were continuations of the British heritage of divide and conquer.Recalling how Pashtun tribes were utilized as frontline combatants in 1948 while Punjabi elites remained behind, he also denounced Pakistan's abuse of Baloch and Pashtun youth. He also drew attention to the fact that thousands of Baloch youths were forcibly drafted into the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s and sent to die under pretences of religious salvation.Marri condemned Pakistan's racial profiling of Afghan refugees, primarily Pashtuns, and their forced deportation as a pressure tactic against Afghanistan. ""These people have lived here for generations, yet they are treated as disposable,"" he said.Calling for a renewed alliance between the Baloch and Pashtun nations, Marri declared, ""Our unity is the path to freedom. Together, we will break the chains of occupation and build a future rooted in justice, sovereignty, and peace.""","Baloch leader Hyrbyair Marri spoke to the Pashtun National Council (Jirga) Marri condemned Pakistan's systematic exploitation, enforced disappearances, and violence against various ethnic communities.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan criminalised online disinformation on Tuesday, passing legislation that enshrines punishments of up to three years in prison, a decision journalists say is designed to crack down on dissent.The law targets anyone who ""intentionally disseminates"" information online that they have ""reason to believe to be false or fake and likely to cause or create a sense of fear, panic or disorder or unrest"".The law was rushed through the national assembly with little warning last week before being approved by the senate on Tuesday as journalists walked out of the gallery in protest.Senior journalist Asif Bashir Chaudhry, a member of the Pakistan federal union of journalists , told AFP the government had assured reporters they would be consulted but said they were ""betrayed and backstabbed"".""We genuinely wanted a law against misinformation, but if it's not being done through open discussion but rather through fear and coercion, we will challenge it on every available platform,"" Chaudhry said.""Even under dictatorships, legislation was not forcefully rammed through parliament the way this government is doing now.""The bill will now be passed to the president to be rubber-stamped.Analysts say the government is struggling with legitimacy after an election plagued with rigging allegations and with Pakistan's most popular politician, former prime minister Imran Khan , in jail on a slew of corruption charges his party says are politically motivated.Khan's supporters and senior leaders have also faced a severe crackdown, with thousands rounded up.Social media site X has been shut down in the wake of elections last February, as posts alleging vote tampering spread on the platform.Khan's name is censored from television and editors have reported increasing monitoring of their programming.Senator Syed Shibli Faraz, a member of Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party, called the new law ""highly undemocratic"" and said it would ""fuel the political victimisation"" of their activists.However, government minister Tanveer Hussain said that the bill would focus on policing social media.""I am sure that in the future, the anarchy caused in society through social media will be controlled,"" he said.There has been a proliferation of ""disinformation"" laws, including criminal legislation, worldwide in the past decade enabling governments to control speech online and police ""fake news"", according to human rights organisation Article 19 .Such laws can impede journalism, according to the group, which promotes freedom of expression and information globally.","Law targets anyone who ""intentionally disseminates"" information online that they have ""reason to believe to be false or fake"" Law rushed through national assembly with little warning before being approved by the senate.

He sentenced the four men to death and also fined them 4.6 million Pakistani rupees (approximately $16,000). They were identified as Rana Usman, Ashfaque Ali, Salman Sajjad, and Wajid Ali.According to the court order, dated Jan 24, the four individuals were sentenced to death by hanging for using derogatory remarks against the Holy Prophet. They were also sentenced to life in prison for defiling the Holy Quran and to 10 years’ imprisonment for deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs. “All the sentences shall run concurrently,” the order read.The prosecution lawyer said the case was supported by forensic evidence from the devices used. The men’s lawyer, Manzoor Rahmani, criticised the court’s order, saying doubts and uncertainties that arise in such cases are ignored by the courts, likely due to fear of a religious backlash and potential mob violence against the judge if the accused is acquitted.“We are preparing our appeals against the decision and will go to the high court,” Rahmani said. A member of a support group formed by the families of the accused was quoted by media as saying the pattern of arrests and prosecutions in this case was consistent with previous ones.“We urge the government to establish a commission to investigate the rise in these cases before these young individuals spend the best years of their lives behind bars,” said the support group member.Critics say blasphemy accusations, whether true or false, often lead to lengthy prison sentences on death row and solitary confinement. The laws, according to them, are often abused to settle scores or used to target members of Pakistan’s religious minorities.Hundreds of people have been accused of blasphemy since the draconian laws were introduced by former dictator Gen Zia-ul-Haq in the 1980s.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan jailed former prime minister Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi , on Monday challenged in a high court their conviction in the Al-Qadir Trust case .

A Pakistani court on Monday awarded death penalty to four men for ""online blasphemy"" against the Prophet Mohammed and the Islamic holy book Quran.The four were charged with spreading blasphemous content online against Prophet Mohammed and the Islamic holy book.""They were sentenced to death... on Friday for spreading blasphemous content online against the Prophet Mohammed and the Quran,"" Rao Abdur Raheem, a lawyer from the legal commission on blasphemy Pakistan, a private group which brought the case to court, told news agency AFP.""Our case was supported by forensic evidence from the devices used in this heinous act,"" he added.The four men were sentenced in Rawalpindi, the garrison city that neighbours the capital Islamabad.A member of a support group formed by the families, however, said to AFP that they would challenge the conviction.""The pattern of arrests and prosecutions in this case is consistent with previous ones,"" said the support group member, who spoke on condition of anonymity told the news agency.""We urge the government to establish a commission to investigate the rise in these cases before these young individuals spend the best years of their lives behind bars,"" the member added.Blasphemy laws in Pakistan are among the strictest in the world, carrying severe punishments, including the death penalty, for offences against Islam.These laws, primarily enshrined in Sections 295-298 of the Pakistan Penal Code, criminalise acts such as insulting the Prophet Muhammad, desecrating the Quran, or offending religious sentiments.These laws have often been criticised for being misused to target minorities, settle personal disputes, and incite mob violence. The lack of safeguards against false accusations has led to numerous cases where individuals face imprisonment, violence, or even extrajudicial killings without substantial evidence.The blasphemy laws have sparked national and international debates about human rights and freedom of expression in Pakistan.Activists argue that these laws suppress religious minorities, limit free speech, and create a climate of fear, while conservative groups strongly defend them as essential to protecting Islam.High-profile cases, such as those of Asia Bibi and Salman Taseer, have highlighted the deep divisions in Pakistani society regarding these laws. Successive governments have been reluctant to amend or repeal the legislation due to the risk of backlash from religious hardliners. As a result, blasphemy remains a highly sensitive issue, with calls for legal reforms often met with strong resistance.","Pakistani court awards death penalty to four men for ""online blasphemy"" against the Prophet Mohammed and the Islamic holy book Quran.

LAHORE: A Pakistani court has awarded a death sentence and 80-year imprisonment to four persons for uploading blasphemous content on Facebook , an official said on Saturday. Additional Sessions Judge Mohammad Tariq Ayub on Friday convicted four suspects -- Wajid Ali, Ahfaq Ali Saqib, Rana Usman and Suleman Sajid -- for insulting Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), his companions, and his wives.The court official said the convicts uploaded blasphemous content on Facebook from four different IDs.""The judge after hearing arguments of both prosecution and defence and witnesses accounts awarded the death penalty and 80 years imprisonment to each of them on different counts,"" the official said.They were also slapped with a fine of PKR 5.2 million.Pakistan's Federal Investigation (FIA) Cybercrime registered a case under Section 11 of the PECA (Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act) and 295A, 295B, 295C, 298A, 109 and 34 of the Pakistan Penal Code on the complaint of Shiraz Farooqi, a citizen.According to Amnesty International , Pakistan's blasphemy laws are often used against religious minorities and others who are the target of false accusations, while emboldening vigilantes prepared to threaten or kill the accused.""There is overwhelming evidence that Pakistan's blasphemy laws violate human rights and encourage people to take the law into their own hands. Once a person is accused, they become ensnared in a system that offers them few protections, presumes them guilty, and fails to safeguard them against people willing to use violence,"" it said.Amnesty International added that in perversion of the justice system, the accused are often presumed to be guilty based on little or no evidence.""Once an accusation of blasphemy is made, the police can arrest the accused, without even checking to see if the charges make sense.

COLOMBO: Sri Lanka announced the lifting of a five-year ban on vehicle imports Tuesday as the country showed further signs of emerging from its worst economic meltdown.Information minister Nalinda Jayatissa said buses, trucks and utility vehicles will be allowed in from Saturday under a phased removal of restrictions in place since 2020.""We are moving very cautiously because we don't want a surge of imports that will deplete our foreign reserves,"" Jayatissa told reporters in Colombo.""Depending on the demand, we will open imports of other categories of vehicles such as cars, motorcycles and three-wheelers.""He said the imports were necessary to generate much-needed tax revenue, and the government hoped to cap imports at about $1.2 billion this year.Current tax rates on vehicles are over 300 per cent.Sri Lanka spent $1.4 billion on vehicle imports in 2019, the last full year before the import ban was imposed in March 2020.The island nation earlier attempted to end the ban on commercial vehicle imports in August 2023, but importers were unable to open letters of credit while the country was still in default on its foreign debt.Sri Lanka formally ended its status as a bankrupt nation in December after securing debt restructuring deals with both bilateral and private creditors.Sri Lanka defaulted on its $46 billion external debt in April 2022 as the country ran out of foreign exchange to finance imports, causing painful shortages of food, fuel and medicines.Months of street protests led to the toppling of then-president Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who was accused of corruption and mismanagement.His successor secured a bailout loan from the international monetary fund , which has said that the South Asian nation is making a recovery but is still not out of the woods.","Buses, trucks and utility vehicles will be allowed in from Saturday under a phased removal of restrictions in place since 2020.

Bangladesh interim govt seeks removal of Sheikh Hasina's daughter Saima Wazed from WHO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-interim-govt-seeks-removal-of-sheikh-hasinas-daughter-from-who/articleshow/117592664.cms,"DHAKA: Bangladesh's interim government has started preparations to take action to remove Saima Wazed , the daughter of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina , from her position as the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Director for South-East Asia.Saima Wazed, based in Delhi, is a psychologist by training and has worked extensively on neurodevelopmental disorders. She was confirmed as the WHO Regional Director on January 23, 2024, by the WHO Executive Board in Geneva.However, the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) of Bangladesh is investigating her for alleged corruption charges. An official stated, ""ACC has taken necessary steps to remove Saima Wazed from WHO. All preparations have been finalized to send letters to the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to take measures to remove her.""In August last year, a student-led movement ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina after weeks of protests that resulted in over 600 deaths. Hasina, 76, fled to India, and an interim government led by Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus was formed.Despite the change in government, a lawyer in Dhaka explained, ""If someone elected after a country's nomination to a United Nations body, he or she remains in position in his or her individual capacity, despite the country's government falls.""The political turmoil in Bangladesh has also spilled over to international politics. Recently, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer faced another setback with the resignation of anti-corruption minister Tulip Siddiq . Siddiq, 42, the niece of Sheikh Hasina, was implicated in an embezzlement investigation tied to Bangladesh.Siddiq clarified her position on X, stating, ""An independent review has confirmed that I have not breached the Ministerial Code and there is no evidence to suggest I have acted improperly. Nonetheless, to avoid distraction for the Government, I have resigned as City Minister."" She also explained that her family connections were disclosed, and she recused herself from matters related to Bangladesh to avoid any perception of conflict of interest.Hasina, who fled Bangladesh last year, has been living in India since August 5. The fallout from these events has significantly affected the political landscape in Bangladesh and has drawn international attention. Despite the investigations and political instability, Wazed remains in her position at WHO, as the case continues.","Saima Wazed is a psychologist by training and has worked extensively on neurodevelopmental disorders.

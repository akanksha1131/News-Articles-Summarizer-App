Musk says DOGE is 'tech support'

Trump speaks about cabinet choices

Zelensky to visit White House

Trump comments on possible cabinet disagreements with Musk's DOGE

Federal workers and job cuts

Trump plans EU tariffs

US President Donald Trump held his first cabinet meeting at the White House on Wednesday. The meeting turned into a long question-and-answer session with reporters, lasting more than an hour.Trump sat with his cabinet and Elon Musk, who was wearing a ""tech support"" T-shirt. He spoke on various topics, including government spending, immigration, the economy, and the war in Ukraine.Here are some key takeaways from Donald Trump's first Cabinet meeting:Wearing a black ""Make America Great Again"" cap, Elon Musk was among the first advisers to speak at the cabinet meeting.His comments came shortly after an administration memo instructed federal departments and agencies to prepare for workforce reductions. The federal government has more than 2 million employees, many of whom are nonpartisan civil servants.Musk downplayed DOGE’s role in government, explaining that its main focus is updating government technology.On his first day back in office, Trump replaced the US Digital Service with DOGE, transferring its employees to the new department.“I actually just call myself humble tech support here because, as crazy as it sounds, that is almost a literal description of the work that the DOGE team is doing: helping to fix the government computer systems,” Musk said.When asked which government department or cabinet members were the most resistant to his policy changes, Trump said, ""So far, I'm happy with all of those choices.""He acknowledged that some groups are more cooperative than others. He specifically praised Elon Musk, who is not a cabinet member, and secretary of state Marco Rubio.Trump said his administration is working on reducing the size of the government. ""We want to have a balanced budget within a reasonably short period of time... meaning maybe by next year or maybe the year after,"" he said.Trump confirmed that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will visit the White House on Friday.He said the US and Ukraine will sign a minerals deal, though details are unclear. He described it as a way for the US to ""get our money back"" from the aid given to Ukraine since Russia's invasion.""We're going to get a lot of money in the future, and I think that's appropriate, because we have taxpayers that shouldn't be footing the bill,"" Trump said. ""It's all been worked out.""Zelensky has called the deal preliminary and said he wants further agreements, including security guarantees.When asked about providing security guarantees, Trump said the US would not do so, arguing that Europe should take on that responsibility.Trump supported Elon Musk and the department of government efficiency (DOGE), which is responsible for cutting government spending and reducing the federal workforce.He dismissed speculation about any disagreements between Musk and other cabinet members. ""They have a lot of respect for Elon and that he's doing this, and some disagree a little bit,"" he said. ""But I will tell you for the most part I think everyone's not only happy, they're thrilled.""He invited cabinet members to speak up if they were unhappy, but no one did.Musk described DOGE as a way for government agencies to remove fraud. He admitted there had been mistakes, mentioning that Ebola prevention efforts were accidentally canceled before being restored. ""But when we make mistakes, we'll fix it very quickly,"" Musk said.Trump addressed an e-mail Musk sent to federal employees, asking them to list five things they had done in the past week or risk losing their jobs. Trump said the cabinet supports the move.He speculated, without evidence, that some of the approximately one million workers who did not respond ""don't exist.""""Maybe they're going to be gone,"" he said.Trump said efforts are underway to identify those who have not responded. ""We're being a little more surgical in situations where people are doing classified stuff,"" he added.He encouraged other cabinet members to carry out similar reviews in their agencies. He also suggested that the Environmental Protection Agency, led by Lee Zeldin, might see a 65 per cent reduction in its workforce.Trump announced plans to impose a 25 per cent tariff on goods from the European Union.""We'll be announcing it very soon,"" he said. ""It'll be 25 per cent generally speaking and that will be on cars and all other things.""He criticized the EU for limiting access to American cars and farm products. ""They've really taken advantage of us,"" he said.Trump was also asked about tariffs on Canada and Mexico. He had previously delayed implementing them for 30 days after discussions with both countries.""April 2, the tariffs go on,"" he said. ""Not all of them but a lot of them. And I think that's gonna be amazing.""","US President Donald Trump held his first cabinet meeting at the White House on Wednesday.

A new opportunity for Indian graduates

Revenue generation

Trump wants to offer wealthy immigrants ‘gold cards’ for $5 million

Gold card to replace current visa system

US President Donald Trump has announced a new visa program that will offer a ""gold card"" with a potential pathway to US citizenship for $5 million, that could significantly benefit Indian graduates and investors. This initiative, which Trump expects to generate significant revenue, is set to replace the existing EB-5 visa program.Speaking about the program at his first cabinet meeting of his second term on Thursday, Trump said that the new program would allow American companies to hire Indian graduates from US universities. He highlighted how current immigration policies have prevented skilled professionals, particularly from India, from staying in the country after completing their education.Also read: Donald Trump plays gold card to US citizenship to entice the world's wealthy ""A person comes from India, China, Japan, lots of different places, and they go to Harvard, the Wharton School of Finance... they are made job offers, but the offer is immediately rescinded because you have no idea whether that person can stay in the country,"" Trump said.He acknowledged that many of these graduates return to their home countries and become successful entrepreneurs. ""They go back to India, or they go back to the country where they came from, and they open up a company, and they become billionaires. They're employing thousands of people,"" he said, pointing out the economic loss for the US.""We have to be able to get people in the country, and we want people that are productive people,"" Trump added.Many countries around the world have citizenship or residency-by-investment programs. In Europe, countries like Portugal offer ""golden visas,"" granting permanent residency to foreigners who invest at least €500,000 ($524,000) in a qualifying fund.Trump sees the gold card visa as a potential source of income for the US. ""If we sell a million, that’s $5 trillion dollars,"" he said, adding that the revenue could help reduce national debt.Also read: Trump’s gold card visa scheme likely to impact Indians planning to apply for green cards through EB-5 route The program will replace the EB-5 visa, which currently grants residency to investors who invest at least $1 million in businesses that create jobs. Trump believes the gold card will attract wealthy individuals who will contribute to the US economy.""They'll be wealthy, and they'll be successful, and they'll be spending a lot of money and paying a lot of taxes and employing a lot of people, and we think it's going to be extremely successful,"" he said.Trump expressed confidence in the demand for the new visa, saying, ""I happen to think it’ll sell like crazy. It’s a market. But we’ll know very soon.""Congress, meanwhile, determines qualifications for US citizenship, but the president said ""gold cards"" would not require congressional approval.US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick, who was also present at the meeting, said the gold card visa program would replace the current visa system for foreign investors but did not provide many details.He confirmed that the initiative would take the place of the EB-5 visa, which grants permanent residency to foreign investors who invest around $1 million and create at least 10 full-time jobs in the US.Also read: Trump’s $5 million 'gold card' visa: What it means for Indians stuck in green card backlogs Lutnick criticized the EB-5 program, calling it ""poorly overseen and poorly executed,"" and said the new gold visa system would be a better alternative.""We're going to make sure they're wonderful world-class global citizens,"" he said about future gold card applicants.It remains unclear how recipients would be selected, whether there would be any restrictions, or if a limit would be set on the number of visas issued.In the fiscal year 2024, the State Department issued more than 12,000 EB-5 visas, marking a record high for the program.","US President Donald Trump has announced a new visa program that will offer a ""gold card"" with a potential pathway to US citizenship for $5 million.

US Supreme Court temporarily blocks order for Trump administration to release billions in foreign aid,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-supreme-court-temporarily-blocks-order-for-trump-administration-to-release-billions-in-foreign-aid/articleshow/118590897.cms,"Donald Trump, US Supreme Court

Sweeping cuts to foreign aid detailed





Lawsuits and congressional pushback



Supreme Court intervention and limited payments



The US Supreme Court on Wednesday temporarily halted a lower court’s order requiring the Trump administration to release billions of dollars in foreign aid by midnight. Chief Justice John Roberts stated that the order from US District Judge Amir H Ali will remain on hold while the high court reviews the case.Judge Ali had ruled in favour of nonprofit groups and businesses that challenged the administration’s freeze on foreign aid, ordering the government to lift the block. However, an appellate panel denied the administration’s request for intervention, prompting an appeal to the Supreme Court.The Trump administration had frozen the funds following an executive order from President Donald Trump, who cited concerns over “wasteful programs” that he claimed did not align with his foreign policy objectives.Earlier on Wednesday, the administration outlined plans to slash more than 90% of the US Agency for International Development’s ( USAID ) foreign aid contracts, reducing overall assistance by $60 billion. The move significantly curtails US development and humanitarian programs globally, marking one of the most aggressive reductions in federal spending.An internal memo obtained by The Associated Press and filings in federal court revealed the administration’s plans. The memo stated that the government was ""clearing significant waste stemming from decades of institutional drift"" and hinted at further changes in the delivery of foreign assistance through USAID and the State Department .President Trump, alongside ally Elon Musk, has led the charge to shrink government spending, particularly targeting USAID programs. Both have criticised the agency’s initiatives as promoting a “liberal agenda” and being financially inefficient.On January 20, Trump ordered a sweeping 90-day review of all foreign assistance programs, leading to an abrupt suspension of aid. The freeze disrupted thousands of US -funded projects, with the administration and Musk's Department of Government Efficiency enforcing staff reductions at USAID through forced leave and firings.In court filings, nonprofit contractors working with USAID described the administration’s rapid contract terminations as an attempt to sidestep compliance with the federal court order. One email from a USAID official, cited in the filings, read, “‘There are MANY more terminations coming, so please gear up!’”Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, condemned the administration’s actions, stating, “The administration is brazenly attempting to blow through Congress and the courts by announcing the completion of their sham ‘review’ of foreign aid and the immediate termination of thousands of aid programs all over the world.”According to the State Department, Secretary of State Marco Rubio has reviewed and approved the terminations. The administration’s cuts include 5,800 of USAID’s 6,200 multiyear contract awards, reducing funding by $54 billion, as well as the elimination of 4,100 of the State Department’s 9,100 grants, cutting an additional $4.4 billion.The State Department memo, first reported by the Washington Free Beacon, acknowledged that the foreign aid terminations were initiated in response to Judge Ali’s order, which set a deadline for lifting the funding freeze by the end of the day Wednesday.As the deadline approached, the Trump administration sought emergency intervention from the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, after repeated warnings from the federal judge, administration officials confirmed they had begun processing a small portion of overdue payments, amounting to just a few million dollars out of the billions owed to US and international organizations and businesses.The Supreme Court is expected to review the case further before issuing a final ruling.","US Supreme Court temporarily halted lower court's order to release billions of dollars in foreign aid by midnight.

'It’s pretty sick': Attorney General Pam Bondi confirms Epstein files to be released tomorrow,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/its-pretty-sick-attorney-general-pam-bondi-confirms-epstein-files-to-be-released-tomorrow/articleshow/118590745.cms,"US Attorney General Pam Bondi

US Attorney General Pam Bondi has confirmed that documents related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein will be made public on Friday, marking a major development in the long-standing case.“It’s pretty sick…” Bondi said in an interview with Fox News host Jesse Watters. When asked when the public could expect access to the files, she responded, “Tomorrow… breaking news right now, you're gonna see some Epstein information being released by my office.”The announcement follows increasing pressure from lawmakers, including Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), who has urged the FBI and Department of Justice to disclose Epstein’s flight logs and other records. In a letter addressed to FBI Director Kash Patel and Attorney General Bondi, Blackburn emphasised the need for transparency.“The American people deserve to know exactly who was affiliated with this network. As you know, over the course of many years, Jeffrey Epstein built a heinous global sex trafficking network that caused irreparable harm to countless women,” Blackburn wrote, as per The Hill.She also called for the release of all video surveillance footage from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence and business records obtained by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.) has also joined calls for disclosure, questioning Bondi on social media about delays in releasing the files. “On Feb 11 & Feb 19, House Oversight sent a letter to the DOJ asking for status on releasing the Epstein files as well as JFK etc. The DOJ has not responded,” she wrote on X.Luna added, ""AGPamBondi what is the status of the documents? These documents were ordered to be declassified.”Meanwhile, Bondi assured that the Trump administration is committed to ensuring accountability. Speaking to political commentator Benny Johnson, she stated, “Donald Trump doesn’t make empty promises. I think promises made, promises kept, and that’s why we’re all there to carry out his directive about making America safe and prosperous.”During her remarks, Bondi reiterated that there is “no legal basis” for those implicated in the Epstein case to keep their identities hidden unless they are minors, victims, or cooperating witnesses.“People in that report are still fighting to keep their names private, Sean. They have no legal basis to do so unless they're a child, a victim, or a cooperating defendant by some chance against some potential case against Ghislaine Maxwell ,” Bondi said in an interview with Fox News.Epstein, a financier with ties to high-profile individuals, was first arrested in Florida in 2005 for allegedly paying a 14-year-old girl for sex. He later pleaded guilty to a lesser charge in 2008, serving 13 months in jail under a work-release program. In 2019, federal prosecutors in New York charged him with sex trafficking, but he died by suicide in his jail cell before standing trial.His longtime associate, Ghislaine Maxwell, was convicted in 2021 for recruiting underage girls for Epstein and sentenced to 20 years in prison.As calls for transparency grow, Bondi has stressed that the Trump administration will not allow figures like Epstein and others involved in such crimes to escape accountability.“I was briefed on that yesterday. I can’t talk about that publicly, but, you know, President Trump has given a very strong directive, and that's going to be followed,” Bondi said.The Department of Justice and FBI have yet to comment on the upcoming release.","US Attorney General Pam Bondi has confirmed that documents related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein will be made public on Friday.

First US measles death in a decade: Unvaccinated child dies as West Texas outbreak reaches 124 cases,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/first-us-measles-death-in-a-decade-unvaccinated-child-dies-as-west-texas-outbreak-reaches-124-cases/articleshow/118590290.cms,"A school-aged child who was not vaccinated has died from measles in West Texas, marking the first measles-related death in the United States since 2015. The child had been hospitalized in Lubbock before passing away, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. Lubbock health officials confirmed the death but did not provide further details.According to ABC7, the outbreak in rural West Texas has grown to 124 confirmed cases across nine counties, making it the state’s largest measles outbreak in nearly 30 years. There are also nine reported cases in eastern New Mexico. The majority of cases involve children between the ages of 5 and 17. Texas health department data indicates that most cases have occurred among people younger than 18, particularly in an ""undervaccinated"" Mennonite community where many children attend small private religious schools or are homeschooled.CNN reported that all 18 people hospitalised so far in the outbreak were unvaccinated. While Robert F Kennedy Jr., the US Health and Human Services secretary, initially stated there had been two measles-related deaths, Texas health officials confirmed that only one had occurred. Kennedy also said during a cabinet meeting that hospitalizations were “mainly for quarantine,” but Dr Lara Johnson, chief medical officer of Covenant Health Lubbock Service Area, refuted that claim. “We don’t hospitalize patients for quarantine purposes,” she said. “We admit patients who need acute supportive treatment in our hospital.”Measles, a highly contagious airborne disease, can cause severe complications, including pneumonia, brain swelling, blindness, and death. According to the CDC, ""Up to 9 out of 10 people who are susceptible will get the virus if exposed."" Dr Catherine Troisi, an infectious disease epidemiologist with UTHealth Houston, stated, “These outbreaks last between two to six months. That’s a long time. That’s a lot of kids infected … death is rare, but tragic when it happens.”Vaccination rates in the affected counties remain low. ABC7 reported that nearly 14% of school-aged children in Gaines County, the epicenter of the outbreak, have opted out of at least one required vaccine. CNN highlighted that nearly 1 in 5 incoming kindergartners in Gaines County did not receive the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine in the 2023-24 school year. Free vaccination clinics have been set up in Lubbock, but only about 70 doses have been administered so far.Experts warn that the outbreak is likely to continue. “I very rarely say I’m 100% sure of something, but I am 100% sure we will see an increase in cases,” said Troisi. Dr. Peter Hotez, co-director of the Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development, noted that cases may be undercounted and expressed concern about potential further spread at upcoming public events. ""It will continue as long as the virus continues to find unvaccinated kids,"" he said.The CDC is providing technical assistance, laboratory support, and vaccines as needed, but Texas health authorities are leading the outbreak response.",A school-aged child who was not vaccinated has died from measles in West Texas.

Donald Trump: 'We left billions of dollars in Afghanistan': Donald Trump demands return of US military gear after 20-year war,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/we-left-billions-of-dollars-in-afghanistan-donald-trump-demands-return-of-us-military-gear-after-20-year-war/articleshow/118589822.cms,"US President Donald Trump and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth

US President Donald Trump has called for the return of billions of dollars’ worth of military equipment left behind in Afghanistan after the 2021 US withdrawal . He also pressed for the removal of military leaders involved in what he described as a disastrous exit.“We left billions, tens of billions of dollars’ worth of equipment behind. Brand new trucks,” Trump said during his first Cabinet meeting on Wednesday. “You see them display it every year, on their little roadways. That’s all top-of-the-line stuff. I think we should get a lot of that equipment back.”The Taliban seized most of the more than $7 billion worth of US military equipment left in Afghanistan, according to a 2022 department of defence report. While US troops removed or destroyed major assets during the drawdown, aircraft, ground vehicles, and other weapons were abandoned. The Pentagon has stated that much of the equipment would likely become inoperable without US maintenance.Trump’s remarks came as he responded to questions about whether he would fire military officials responsible for the withdrawal. While he said he would not dictate decisions to defence secretary Pete Hegseth , he was clear in his stance. “I’m not going to tell this man what to do, but I will say that if I had his place, I’d fire every single one of them, Pete,” he said.Hegseth confirmed that under his leadership, the department of defence is conducting a thorough review of the Afghanistan withdrawal and plans to hold individuals accountable. “We’re taking a very different view, obviously, than the previous administration,” Hegseth said, pointing to Trump’s nomination of retired Air Force lieutenant general John Dan “Razin” Caine as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. “And there will be full accountability.”Trump expects the Pentagon’s review to lead to the removal of most generals involved in the withdrawal, which saw American citizens and US allies left behind, billions of dollars in military equipment abandoned, and 13 US service members killed in a suicide bombing at Abbey Gate outside Hamid Karzai International Airport.“I don’t see a big promotion in that group,” Trump said of the officials involved. “I think they’re going to be largely gone. That was a horrible display.”“The outcome in Afghanistan was the result of many decisions from many years of war,” Former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, retired army general Mark Milley testified. “Like any complex phenomena, there was no single causal factor that determined the outcome.”US Central Command, which oversees military operations in the Middle East, was responsible for the withdrawal.Trump also called on the Taliban to return US military equipment, claiming that Afghanistan has become “one of the biggest sellers of military equipment in the world,” profiting from abandoned US weapons, armour, and machinery.“I think they should give our equipment back. And I told Pete to study that,” Trump said.",US President Donald Trump called for the return of billions of dollars’ worth of military equipment left behind in Afghanistan after the 2021 US withdrawal.

'We are bloated & sloppy': Trump directs federal agencies to cut jobs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/we-are-bloated-sloppy-trump-directs-federal-agencies-to-cut-jobs/articleshow/118590036.cms,"President Donald Trump (AP Photo)

The US government is undergoing a major restructuring as President Donald Trump pushes federal agencies to devise plans for workforce reductions and program consolidations.On Wednesday, senior officials initiated the process with a directive that expands Trump’s ongoing efforts to scale back what he sees as an overextended government. Thousands of probationary employees have already been dismissed, and now, the administration is shifting its focus to career civil servants with employment protections.""We're cutting down the size of government. We have to,"" Trump stated during his first Cabinet meeting of his second term.""We're bloated. We're sloppy. We have a lot of people that aren’t doing their job,"" Trump said according to news agency AP.The Trump administration's move is expected to have nationwide consequences, as approximately 80 per cent of federal employees work outside of Washington, DC Essential services such as patent approvals, food safety inspections, and park maintenance may be disrupted depending on how the cuts are executed.Opposition to the initiative is anticipated. Labor unions, Democratic state leaders, and advocacy groups have already used legal challenges to slow Trump’s previous efforts. Even some Republican lawmakers have expressed concerns about how deep budget cuts could impact their constituencies.“Once you do this damage, it’s going to be incredibly hard to rebuild the capacity of these organizations,” said Don Moynihan, a public policy professor at the University of Michigan. “It’s not like you can turn the switch back on and everything is going to be the way it was before.”Federal agencies have also been instructed to submit their workforce reduction plans by March 13. These proposals will not only outline layoffs but also specify which positions will be permanently eliminated. While no fixed targets have been disclosed, Trump has suggested that the Environmental Protection Agency, for instance, could reduce its workforce by 65 per cent.By April 14, agencies must also present strategies for streamlining management, increasing efficiency, and potentially relocating offices to lower-cost regions outside Washington. The deadline for implementation is set for September 30.Administration officials justify the initiative as both a fiscal necessity and a strategic shift.“The federal government is costly, inefficient, and deeply in debt. At the same time, it is not producing results for the American public,” wrote Russell Vought, director of the White House’s Office of Management and Budget, and Charles Ezell, acting director of the Office of Personnel Management.Vought, a key figure in shaping Trump’s second-term policies, has long advocated for concentrating power under the executive branch while dismantling entrenched bureaucracies.Don Moynihan warned that the administration is exploiting executive power to reshape government operations without congressional approval.""There’s a fundamental realignment of power here,"" Moynihan said.""This administration is saying we have much more power than any previous administration when it comes to deciding how government works,"" he further told news agency AP.","US government is undergoing a major restructuring as President Donald Trump pushes federal agencies to devise plans for workforce reductions and program consolidations. Thousands of probationary employees have already been dismissed, and now, the administration is shifting its focus to career civil servants with employment protections.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118590153,imgsize-82344,width-400,resizemode-4/118590153.jpg"
"Matthew Perry was given 27 ketamine shots before death, final dose by assistant: Documentary",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/matthew-perry-was-given-27-ketamine-shots-before-death-final-dose-by-assistant-documentary/articleshow/118590040.cms,"Matthew Perry

Matthew Perry was administered 27 doses of ketamine in the three days leading up to his death, according to a new documentary, Matthew Perry: A Hollywood Tragedy, released on Peacock.The Friends actor, who passed away at the age of 54 in October 2023, died from "" acute effects of ketamine "" in what was ruled an accidental drowning, as per his autopsy report. The documentary features US Attorney Martin Estrada, who oversaw the case before stepping down in January, stating that Perry had received the ketamine injections from “people who should have known much better.”Authorities have charged five individuals in connection with Perry’s death, including two doctors, his live-in personal assistant, and an alleged drug dealer known as the ""Ketamine Queen."" According to an indictment unsealed last August, reported by The Independent, Perry’s assistant, Kenneth Iwamasa, along with Erik Fleming, worked with doctors Salvador Plasencia and Mark Chavez to obtain large amounts of ketamine for the actor. Additionally, Jasveen Sangha, dubbed the ""Ketamine Queen,"" is accused of supplying the fatal dose.On the morning of Perry’s death, Iwamasa administered the first ketamine injection at around 8:30 am The second dose was given four hours later while Perry was watching a movie at his Pacific Palisades home, and a third injection followed just 40 minutes later, as per a plea agreement Iwamasa signed. Before receiving his final dose, Perry reportedly told Iwamasa, “Shoot me up with a big one,” before instructing him to prepare the hot tub, New York Post reported.Following the last injection, Iwamasa left to run errands, leaving Perry alone. The actor was later found unresponsive in his hot tub.Estrada described the involvement of medical professionals in the case, stating, “Dr Plasencia was very clear in text messages… that he saw this as an opportunity to make a lot of money in a short amount of time, and he allegedly did just that.”While some of the accused are still awaiting trial, Perry’s former assistant, Iwamasa, pleaded guilty in August 2024 to one count of conspiracy to distribute ketamine causing death (New York Post). The joint trial for Plasencia and Sangha is scheduled for March 2025.Estrada emphasised the shift in perspective regarding overdose cases and said, “In the past, we used to call these things overdose deaths and do more blaming of the victim. We don’t do that anymore. We blame the drug dealers, the drug sellers, for taking advantage of those addiction issues to cause death or serious injury, and that’s why we bring these cases.”","Matthew Perry was administered 27 doses of ketamine in the three days leading up to his death, according to a new documentary.

South Carolina's Republican lawmaker Joe Wilson proposed to introduce new $250 currency bill featuring, President Donald Trump , a move that would make Trump the first living current or former president to appear on US currency, as the Newsweek reported.Wilson cited economic challenges, which he attributed to "" Bidenflation ,"" as a key reason for the proposal. He claimed that inflation during former President Joe Biden 's administration forced Americans to carry more cash. Wilson promoted the proposal on social media, saying, ""Most valuable bill for most valuable President!""""Bidenflation"" is a term used by critics to describe the inflation surge under Biden, which peaked at 9.1% in mid-2022—the highest rate since the early 1980s.The Biden administration attributed the increase to global issues like supply-chain disruptions, the Covid-19 pandemic, and the war in Ukraine.However, opponents pointed to Biden's policies, including increased government spending and energy regulations, as contributing factors.Wilson, known for his outspoken criticism of Democratic leaders—including his ""You lie!"" outburst during Barack Obama 's 2017 State of the Union address—shared a mock-up of the proposed bill featuring a stern-looking Trump.The legislation has not yet been formally introduced in Congress, and no timeline for its consideration has been set. If approved, the $250 bill would become the highest-denomination US banknote in circulation.Wilson, who serves on the House Armed Services Committee, has recently voiced strong opinions on international issues, including labelling Russian President Vladimir Putin as a ""war criminal"", advocating for free elections in Georgia, and supporting sanctions against Iran.","South Carolina's Republican lawmaker Joe Wilson proposed to introduce new $250 currency bill featuring, President Donald Trump.

Federal workers storm senate in protest against Musk-led job cuts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/federal-workers-storm-senate-in-protest-against-musk-led-job-cuts/articleshow/118589966.cms,"AP photo

A group of federal workers marched through the US Senate, to protest massive job cuts ordered by billionaire Elon Musk on Wednesday.The demonstrators visited multiple Republican senators, urging them to take action against the workforce reductions, while security personnel followed closely, warning them not to obstruct the halls, reported news agency AFP.President Donald Trump’s second term has brought sweeping executive orders targeting federal agencies including USAID. Musk, who is spearheading the downsizing, has left many career civil servants uncertain about their futures. Unlike the large-scale protests of Trump’s first term, opposition this time has started with federal employees themselves.Some employees have resigned instead of accepting Musk’s drastic changes. This week, about a third of technology workers at Musk’s newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) quit, claiming the restructuring would harm national security. Before leaving, they created a website called “We are the builders” to highlight the damage caused by the cuts.Protesters have adopted the spoon as a symbol of resistance. This comes from a Musk-led initiative called “Fork in the road,” which gave federal workers a choice: leave with eight months’ pay or risk future dismissal. Employees flooded internal message boards with spoon emojis and added them to their work profiles as a silent act of defiance.Several lawsuits have been filed against Musk’s actions, with mixed outcomes. The largest federal employee union, the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), has vowed to fight what it calls “unlawful terminations.”Musk, however, remains unfazed. He has used his social media platform, X, to mock federal workers and promote polls conducted by his own political group, America PAC, claiming that DOGE is widely supported.","Federal workers marched through the US Senate, to protest massive job cuts ordered by billionaire Elon Musk.

President Donald Trump administration is cutting more than 90% of foreign aid contracts issued by the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and reducing $60 billion in overall assistance worldwide, according to an internal memo obtained by The Associated Press.The decision follows a 90-day review ordered by President Donald Trump to reassess funding provided by USAID and the State Department for international development and aid programmes. The cuts significantly shrink USAID’s operations, leaving only a handful of projects that advocates are now attempting to preserve through ongoing legal battles.The Washington Free Beacon first reported on the reductions, which were detailed in both the internal memo and court filings submitted on Wednesday. The administration’s move was influenced by a court order requiring officials to lift a monthlong block on foreign aid funding by the end of the day Wednesday.“In response, State and USAID moved rapidly,” the memo stated, adding that the agencies targeted “USAID and State Department foreign aid programs in vast numbers for contract terminations.”","President Donald Trump administration is cutting more than 90% of foreign aid contracts issued by the US Agency for International Development (USAID) The cuts significantly shrink USAID’s operations, leaving only a handful of projects that advocates are now attempting to preserve through ongoing legal battles.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118589528,imgsize-1146213,width-400,resizemode-4/118589528.jpg"

Clock running out for refugees in Islamabad, Rawalpindi



'We've worked with the Americans for years'



Kabul, Islamabad row amid rising crackdown



Forced to move after decades in Pakistan



UN says Pakistan has a tradition of protecting Afghans

A woman who we will call Fatima fled Afghanistan with her family in December 2021. She had worked for an American non-profit organization in Kabul ­until the US pullout in the summer of 2021, when the Taliban retook control of the country.She is now based in the Pakistani capital, Islamabad. And she is in trouble. Her Pakistani visa is days away from expiring, and the authorities are still processing her renewal application.""I am concerned about the renewal of my visa, and if not renewed timely authorities would arrest me and my family for illegally residing in the country,"" Fatima told DW.Police, including female officers, recently conducted a raid on a building where Fatima lives, looking for undocumented Afghan refugees. She was not in the building at the time, but her brother ended up in custody.""Later, we showed them our visa renewal application receipts and proof but police did not cooperate,"" said Fatima, who is now hiding from the authorities.In 2023, Pakistan started a massive initiative to repatriate approximately 4 million Afghans who have entered the country over the past 40 years. And while the authorities granted some leeway last year, Pakistan's government has now set a March 31 deadline to expel foreign nationals residing in the country illegally, with search operations ongoing in January and February.Afghan refugees living in Islamabad and the nearby city of Rawalpindi ""have been verbally asked to leave Pakistan till 28th February,"" Umer Gillani, a legal expert and rights activist, told DW.Moniza Kakar, a lawyer working for refugees advocacy in Pakistan, said there was ""uncertainty and fear"" among the Afghani nationals in the area.""Since the start of this year, over 1,000 Afghans have been detained in Islamabad, and more than 18,000 have been forced to leave Islamabad and Rawalpindi because of government orders,"" she said.Amin, 28, is from Kabul. He spent years collaborating with the United States in the fight against the Taliban in Afghanistan, before he too had to flee across the Pakistani border.Hee said he was just days away from being evacuated to America, but this was put on hold last month with President Donald Trump signing an executive order to suspend a refugee resettlement program.Nearly 20,000 Afghans are presently waiting in Pakistan for approval to resettle in the US through an American government program.""We've worked with the Americans for years, we helped and supported them in Afghanistan, we have given them a part of our lives and they have to support us so that we can live peacefully,"" Amin told DW.Over the last three years, Pakistan's relationship with neighboring Afghanistan has deteriorated. Islamabad holds the Taliban authorities in Afghanistan responsible for their inability to control the operations of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a militant group that formed in 2007 and has conducted numerous attacks on Pakistani security forces.As cross-border tensions with the Taliban regime escalate, concerns were also raised about the well-being of Afghans in Pakistan amid reports of purported intimidation and arrests. The UN special rapporteur has expressed his worries, stating that Afghans in the area deserve more humane treatment.Activist Gilani said millions of Afghan refugees in Pakistan are being used as ""hostages to build pressure whenever there is tension between the two countries.""Last week, Pakistan's Foreign Ministry dismissed claims made by the Afghan representation regarding the mistreatment of Afghan refugees in Pakistan, labeling these allegations as ""misplaced"" and urging Kabul to facilitate the smooth repatriation of Afghan citizens.Pakistan has accommodated hundreds of thousands of refugees from its northern neighbor, a situation resulting from decades of regional instability. Afghans who arrived in Pakistan following the Taliban takeover in August 2021 have been relying on visa renewals to stay in the country, a procedure that is costly, uncertain and often subject to significant delays.""The stories of refugees are devastating. Families who have lived in Pakistan for years, even decades, are now being uprooted due to tensions between the two countries. Children, women, and men who have already suffered so much are being treated as if they don't matter. This is not just a refugee crisis, it's a humanitarian crisis,"" said Kakar.UNHCR's top representative in Pakistan, Philippa Candler, told DW that Pakistan already repatriated over 800,000 Afghan refugees between September 2023 and the end of last year.""As of December 2024, Pakistan hosted over 2.8 million Afghans with 69% of refugees living outside refugee villages,"" she said.Candler acknowledged Pakistan's generosity in hosting Afghan refugees for decades, and the current ""economic and security challenges"" in Pakistan that drive the repatriation efforts.At the same time, UNHCR was urging the Islamabad government to ""see the situation of Afghans through a humanitarian perspective"" and ""continue its long-standing tradition of protecting vulnerable Afghans […] regardless of their status.""""It's essential that we work hand-in-hand with both host countries and countries of origin to develop mechanisms that empower refugees to rebuild their lives in safety and dignity, including voluntary repatriation,"" she said.""We are calling for dialogue between the two countries, and for the refugee issue to be separated from political matters.""","Afghan refugees living in Islamabad and the nearby city of Rawalpindi are in trouble.

New York City is terminating a $220m deal with the Pakistan-owned Roosevelt Hotel to house a migrant shelter following a prolonged MAGA meltdown over use of American taxpayer money to facilitate immigration to the US.Under pressure from the federal government and MAGA hardliners, Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat who gravitated to the Trump orbit after facing corruption charges from the Biden administration, announced closure of the site that is said to have housed tens of thousands of migrants in its 1025 rooms at $ 200 a night.The site opened in May 2023 to serve as both a new arrivals center and shelter for asylum seekers under a three-year $ 220 million deal with government-run Pakistan International Airlines, which owns the hotel, having bought out a Saudi stake in it for $ 36.4million in 2005.At peak traffic in 2023 when around 4000 migrants were arriving in the city each week, the sight of asylum seekers camping outside the hotel waiting to be processed triggered MAGA hardliners and even some New Yorkers, as Trump and his supporters complained about Democrats housing ""illegal immigrants"" in ""luxury hotels"" at the expense of US taxpayers.""A taxpayer-funded hotel for illegal migrants is owned by the Pakistani government, which means NYC taxpayers are effectively paying a foreign government to house illegals in our own country.

However, other sub-conditions of these entities regarding governance structure and financial safeguards have already been met.The funding under RSF is made available to nations who commit high-quality reforms to build resilience against climate catastrophes through adaptation and is repayable over 30 years, including a 10-year grace period and is normally cheaper than EFF terms.In October last year, Pakistan formally requested the IMF to top up its USD 7 billion EFF with another USD 1.2 billion RSF.The Fund had already advised Pakistan to invest 1 per cent of GDP per year (over Rs 1.24 trillion at the current year's estimate) in climate resilience and adaptation reforms to be ready to fight repeated and increasing cycles of extreme weather conditions, particularly floods and sustain economic growth and reverse inequalities.Such an investment in climate-adaptive infrastructure can reduce the negative growth impact of a natural disaster shock by one-third while ensuring a quicker and more complete recovery, the IMF suggested.The IMF noted that about 1 per cent of GDP investment in adaptation infrastructure would increase Pakistan's climate resilience and buffer climate shocks.These investments would reduce the growth impact of a natural disaster shock by about a third and return Pakistan to its previous GDP level more quickly.According to the IMF, Pakistan's living standards have been declining for decades, and despite a similar starting point in the early 1980s, Pakistanis' incomes had stagnated and fallen behind regional peers.At the same time, poverty rates remained elevated, and social development indicators also lagged behind those of peers.This had been accompanied by weak human capital outcomes, low fiscal capacity, protection for favoured industries, and a large state footprint. Contributions to growth from human capital and efficiency gains were low, and health and education indicators, while improving in recent years, still lag behind regional and lower-middle-income peers. Human capital spending as a share of GDP has steadily declined.The consequences of these structural weaknesses have been exacerbated by increasingly high climate vulnerability.""Pakistan's climate faces a rate of warming significantly higher than the global average. This will bring increasingly greater climate variability and extreme events, including reduced water availability, more severe and longer droughts, accelerated glacial melt, more variable and intense monsoons accompanied by floods and landslides, and sea-level rise encroaching on coastal settlements and infrastructure,"" it said.The negative macroeconomic consequences of such a shift have already been felt. Climate and weather-related disasters, which have increasingly been exacerbated by climate change, resulted in USD 29.3 billion in economic losses over 1992-2021, equivalent to 11.1 per cent of 2020 GDP, which slowed developmental gains.More recently, the floods of 2022 killed 1,700 people, displaced eight million, increased the poverty rate by up to four percentage points, and brought economic losses equivalent to 4.8 per cent of FY22 GDP, with reconstruction needs estimated at 1.6 times the budgeted national development expenditure of FY23.The disaster was exacerbated by Pakistan's weak urban planning, infrastructure and water resource management, according to Dawn.","Pakistan had requested USD 1 billion to address the impact of climate change. The technical team will mainly engage with key ministries, including planning, finance, climate change, petroleum, water resources, the Federal Board of Revenue, disaster management agencies, and provincial governments. The Fund had already advised Pakistan to invest 1 per cent of GDP per year in climate resilience.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118528644,imgsize-993072,width-400,resizemode-4/118528644.jpg"
"No passengers, no planes: China-funded $240m Gwadar airport sits idle",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/no-passengers-no-planes-china-funded-240m-gwadar-airport-sits-idle/articleshow/118512631.cms,"Gwadar airport in Pakistan (Pic credit: AP)

With no passengers and no planes, Pakistan's newest and most expensive airport is a bit of a mystery. Entirely financed by China to the tune of $240 million, it's anyone's guess when New Gwadar International Airport will open for business. Located in the coastal city of Gwadar and completed in Oct 2024, its a stark contrast to the impoverished, restive southwestern Balochistan province around it.For the past decade, China has poured money into Balochistan and Gwadar as part of a multibillion dollar project that connects its western Xinjiang province with Arabian Sea, called the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor or CPEC.Authorities have hailed it as transformational but there's scant evidence of change in Gwadar. The city isn't connected to the national grid - electricity comes from Iran or solar panels - and there isn't enough clean water. An airport with a 400,000 passenger capacity isn't a priority for the city's 90,000 people.""This airport is not for Pakistan or Gwadar,"" said Azeem Khalid, an international relations expert who specialises in Pakistan-China ties. ""It is for China, so they can have secure access for their citizens to Gwadar and Balochistan.""CPEC has catalysed a decadeslong insurgency in resource-rich and strategically located Balochistan. Separatists, aggrieved by what they say is state exploitation at the expense of locals, are fighting for independence - targeting Pakistani troops and Chinese workers in the province and elsewhere. Members of Pakistan's ethnic Baloch minority say they face discrimination by govt and are denied opportunities available elsewhere in the country, charges govt denies.Pakistan, keen to protect China's investments, has stepped up its military footprint in Gwadar to combat dissent. The city is a jumble of checkpoints, barbed wire, troops, barricades, and watchtowers. Roads close at any given time, several days a week, to permit the safe passage of Chinese workers and Pakistani VIPs.Intelligence officers monitor journalists visiting Gwadar. Its fish market is deemed too sensitive for coverage.Many locals are frazzled. ""Nobody used to ask where we are going, what we are doing, and what is your name,"" said Khuda Bakhsh Hashim, 76. ""We used to enjoy all-night picnics in the mountains or rural areas. We are residents. Those who ask should identify themselves as to who they are.""Hashim recalled when Gwadar was part of Oman, not Pakistan, and was a stop for passenger ships heading to Mumbai. People didn't go hungry and found work easily, he said.But Gwadar's water has dried up because of drought and unchecked exploitation. So has the work. Govt says CPEC has created some 2,000 local jobs but it's not clear whom they mean by ""local"" - Baloch residents or Pakistanis from elsewhere in the country. Authorities did not elaborate.There is a perception Gwadar is dangerous or difficult to visit - only one commercial route operates out of its domestic airport, three times a week to Karachi, Pakistan's largest city. There are no direct flights to Balochistan's provincial capital of Quetta, or national capital of Islamabad.Security concerns delayed the inauguration of the international airport. There were fears the area's mountains - and their proximity to the airport - could be the ideal launchpad for an attack. Instead, PM Shehbaz Sharif and his Chinese counterpart Li Qiang hosted a virtual ceremony. The inaugural flight was off limits to media and public.","Gwadar is Pakistan's newest and most expensive airport. Entirely financed by China to the tune of $240 million.

ISLAMABAD: A mob enraged by a local’s murder over a trivial parking dispute snatched the suspect, a watchman, from police and lynched him in the mountainous Galiyat region of Pakistan's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Sunday. Several police officers were wounded in the violence in a neighbourhood under the jurisdiction of Changla Gali police station, around 80km from Islamabad.Police said Imran Abbasi, a local, had parked his car in the designated area of a housing society and left for home. When he returned the next day, he got into a fight with the watchman, Khan Zaman, who allegedly stabbed him to death and wounded his brother.As word spread about the murder, a mob milled in the area and burned down five houses in the residential society.Police apprehended the culprit, who was hiding in the basement of a building, and were about to take him away when the mob swooped on him and beat him to death with sticks and stones.Lynchings are common in Pakistan and several instances of mob violence have taken place in the past decade. Many people have been lynched for alleged blasphemy, while mobs have also murdered suspects in street crimes.In June 2024, a suspected robber was lynched by a mob in the southern port city of Karachi. The suspect, armed with a pistol, had attempted to rob a citizen, who put up resistance and was joined by others standing nearby. The mob got hold of the suspect and hit him with blunt weapons, resulting in his death on the spot.In May 2024, another mob lynched a suspected robber in Karachi's Orangi town while police saved his accomplice from being killed.The same month, police rescued a Christian man from angry people, who wanted to lynch him and attacked the homes of other minority members in Punjab’s Sargodha district on charges of alleged blasphemy. Workers at a Sialkot garment factory tortured and burned to death their Sri Lankan general manager in 2023 for alleged blasphemy.","Imran Abbasi, a local, had parked his car in the designated area of a housing society and left for home.

Militancy in Balochistan



Airport inauguration delayed due to security concerns



Pakistan’s newest airport in Gwadar, fully funded by China at a cost of $240 million, remains unused months after its completion in October 2024.Spread over 4,300 acres of land. the airport is Pakistan's largest international airport and was officially opened on January 20 this year. Work started on Gwadar airport in 2019.The Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) PK 503 aircraft was the first commercial flight to arrive at the new airport after its inauguration carrying commercial passengers and high-ranking officials.However, the airport, designed to handle 400,000 passengers annually, has no scheduled flights.The New Gwadar International Airport is part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ), a multi-billion dollar project aimed at linking China’s Xinjiang province with the Arabian Sea. While officials have called it a major development, many in Gwadar say they see little benefit.Gwadar, located in Pakistan's Balochistan province , lacks basic infrastructure such as a stable electricity supply and clean water.""This airport is not for Pakistan or Gwadar,"" Azeem Khalid, an expert in Pakistan-China relations was quoted as saying by the news agency Associated Press (AP). ""It is for China, so they can have secure access for their citizens to Gwadar and Balochistan.""The airport’s construction comes amid ongoing security challenges in Balochistan. Separatist groups in the province oppose what they call exploitation of local resources, targeting both Pakistani security forces and Chinese workers.Pakistan has increased its military presence in Gwadar to protect Chinese investments, leading to more checkpoints and restrictions on movement. Roads are often closed to ensure the safety of Chinese workers and high-ranking officials.""Nobody used to ask where we are going, what we are doing, and what is your name,"" 76-year-old Gwadar resident Khuda Bakhsh Hashim was quoted as saying by the AP. ""We are asked to prove our identity, who we are, where we have come from. We are residents. Those who ask should identify themselves as to who they are.""Authorities claim CPEC has created 2,000 jobs, but there is no clarity on whether these positions were given to local Baloch residents or people from other parts of Pakistan.Gwadar remains largely disconnected, with only one commercial flight route operating three times a week to Karachi. There are no direct flights to Quetta, the provincial capital, or Islamabad.Militancy in Balochistan has increased in recent years, with attacks rising after 2021. Groups such as the Baloch Liberation Army have carried out multiple attacks, particularly after the Pakistani Taliban ended a ceasefire in 2022.Earlier, the airport’s opening was postponed due to security risks. Authorities feared that nearby mountains could be used to launch attacks. Instead, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Chinese Premier Li Qiang held a virtual inauguration. The first flight landed without media or public presence.Abdul Ghafoor Hoth, a local leader from the Balochistan Awami Party, said no local residents were hired to work at the airport.""Not a single resident of Gwadar was hired to work at the airport, not even as a watchman,"" he was quoted by AP.Hoth had led protests in December demanding better living conditions in Gwadar. The demonstrations lasted 47 days before authorities promised to address local concerns, including improved access to water and electricity. Since then, no progress has been made on these commitments.","Gwadar airport is Pakistan's largest international airport and was officially opened on January 20 this year.

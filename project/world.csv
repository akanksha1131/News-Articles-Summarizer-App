UN experts accuse Israel of genocidal acts and sexual violence in Gaza • FRANCE 24 English

A United Nations-backed team of human rights experts accused Israel of using sexual, reproductive, and gender-based violence in its military campaign against Hamas in Gaza, reported news agency Associated Press.The report, released on Thursday, is among the most detailed investigations into such allegations since the war began on October 7, 2023. Israel has strongly rejected the claims, calling the UN body biased.The report documents violations allegedly committed by Israeli security forces against Palestinian men, women, and children. The findings could be used as evidence in international legal cases, including at the International Criminal Court.According to the commission, Israeli forces carried out attacks on hospitals, health facilities, and civilian areas, disproportionately affecting women and children. It also accused Israeli authorities of subjecting Palestinian detainees to sexual violence and destroying reproductive healthcare services.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the Human Rights Council an “anti-Israel circus” that supports terrorism. Israel’s UN mission in Geneva also rejected the findings, arguing that the commission relied on second-hand and unverified sources. Since the commission’s formation in 2021, Israel has refused to cooperate with its investigations, citing bias.Hamas, in response to the report, urged international courts to prosecute Israeli leaders. The International Criminal Court has already issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and other top Israeli officials for alleged war crimes. The court has also issued a warrant for Hamas’ military leader, who was later confirmed dead.The war in Gaza began after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on October 7, 2023, killing around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 251 hostages.","UN experts accuse Israel of genocidal acts and sexual violence in Gaza.

This Elon Musk backed group is attacking Republican lawmakers over a drug program- Here's why,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/this-elon-musk-backed-group-is-attacking-republican-lawmakers-over-a-drug-program-heres-why/articleshow/118998997.cms,"AP photo





An Elon Musk-backed group, Building America’s Future, is running attack ads against Republican lawmakers in multiple states over their support of the 340B drug pricing program . The 340B program , requires drug companies to give discounts to hospitals treating low-income patients.The 340B program, created to help hospitals serving uninsured and low-income patients, has been a long-running battleground between hospitals and pharmaceutical companies. Hospitals argue that the program is essential to providing affordable care, while drug manufacturers claim it forces them to sell medications at a loss.The video ads, titled ""Trump underminers,"" have been aired in Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Tennessee, and Kentucky, reported Associated Press. They claim that some Republicans are expanding the 340B program, which they allege funds gender transitions for children, abortions, and healthcare for undocumented immigrants. It says it ""is now a disaster"" and to ""let Trump fix 340B.""North Dakota Rep. Jon Nelson dismissed the ad’s message claiming that drug companies want to eliminate the program because it forces them to sell at a discount.Lawmakers insist that there is no active movement to expand the 340B program. Kentucky State Sen. Stephen Meredith clarified that his legislation is not about 340B expansion but about protecting rural healthcare providers from discrimination by pharmaceutical manufacturers.The ads have aired on television in multiple states, and the group also ran messages in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania in past elections. The group previously funded campaigns that targeted Vice President Kamala Harris over her stance on Israel.In February, the group posted a photo on X (formerly Twitter) of a truck parked outside the North Dakota Capitol, displaying messages claiming 340B subsidises gender transitions for kids. However, North Dakota banned gender-affirming care for minors in 2023.","Elon Musk-backed group, Building America’s Future, is running attack ads against Republican lawmakers in multiple states over their support of the 340B drug pricing program.

US judge orders Trump administration to reinstate thousands of fired government employees,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-judge-orders-trump-administration-to-reinstate-thousands-of-fired-government-employees/articleshow/118999603.cms,"Donald Trump (File photo)

Federal judge in San Francisco and Maryland ordered US President Donald Trump's administration to reinstate numerous probationary workers who were dismissed across various agencies.In San Francisco, Judge William Alsup criticised the government's methods on Thursday whilst halting the administration's substantial reduction of federal staff. The judge determined that the Office of Personnel Management and its acting director, Charles Ezell, executed terminations without proper authority.He further mandated several departments, including Veterans Affairs, Agriculture, Defense, Energy, Interior and Treasury, to promptly offer reinstatement to staff terminated around February 13 and 14. The departments must provide details within seven days regarding probationary employees and their compliance with the directive.The administration lodged an appeal against the injunction with the Ninth Circuit Court. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt defended the administration's position, stating, ""The Trump Administration will immediately fight back against this absurd and unconstitutional order.""Judge Alsup expressed concern about the government's circumvention of workforce reduction regulations by dismissing probationary workers lacking appeal rights. He criticised the practice of citing poor performance as grounds for dismissal despite recent positive evaluations.""These mass-firings of federal workers were not just an attack on government agencies and their ability to function, they were also a direct assault on public lands, wildlife, and the rule of law,"" said Erik Molvar, executive director of Western Watersheds Project, one of the plaintiffs.Meanwhile, in the second ruling issued by the Maryland court, judge temporarily halted the widespread dismissals of probationary federal employees and mandated the reinstatement of thousands who were terminated, marking the second such ruling within 24 hours.US District Judge James Bredar issued the directive on Thursday evening in response to legal proceedings initiated by 19 states and the District of Columbia against several federal agencies, challenging the legality of these extensive terminations. The states argue that the Trump administration caught them off guard by disregarding established regulations governing large-scale redundancies, which are presently affecting state governments as they attempt to support those who have abruptly lost their employment.The order resulted from legal action by labour unions and organisations opposing the Republican administration's federal workforce reduction efforts.As these judges ruled against Trump administration's orders, a Washington DC judge ruled against unions, directing workers to follow established employment procedures.Government lawyers maintained the dismissals' legitimacy, citing individual agency reviews of probationary employees.The federal system includes approximately 200,000 probationary workers, comprising new employees and recently promoted staff. California employs about 15,000, serving in various capacities from fire prevention to veterans' services, according to the coalition's lawsuit.The plaintiffs documented that numerous agencies cited OPM directives for the terminations, using template emails citing performance issues as justification.","Federal judge in San Francisco and Maryland ordered US President Donald Trump's administration to reinstate numerous probationary workers.

Columbia University disciplines student protesters who seized campus building last year

Columbia University has has expelled students involved in last year’s pro-Palestinian protests, expelling some, suspending others, and revoking the diplomas of certain graduates.The university made the announcement on Thursday in a campus-wide email, citing violations related to the occupation of Hamilton Hall in April 2024. Students who had only participated in the encampment without entering Hamilton Hall were not subjected to further punishment.It did not disclose how many students were expelled or suspended but said that decisions were made based on the severity of each student’s actions, reported news agency Associated Press.The move follows pressure from the Trump administration, which recently cut over $400 million in federal funding , accusing the university of failing to address antisemitism on campus .The April 2024 protests began with a tent encampment, which later escalated when a smaller group of students barricaded themselves inside Hamilton Hall using furniture and padlocks. At the request of university officials, New York police forcibly removed the protesters, arresting dozens. Although 31 of the 46 arrested students had their trespassing charges dropped, they still faced university disciplinary hearings.The announcement comes amid the arrest of Palestinian student activist Mahmoud Khalil by federal immigration authorities last Saturday. Trump has said that Khalil’s arrest is “the first of many.” At the same time, House Republicans are demanding disciplinary records of students involved in the protests, threatening further financial penalties if the university does not comply.Also read: 'Free Mahmoud, free them all': Protesters take over Trump Tower, NYC demanding Columbia student's release On Thursday, Khalil and seven other students filed a lawsuit in federal court to block Congress from obtaining their records. The lawsuit argues that the demand violates students’ First Amendment rights and is an attempt to suppress political speech.Meanwhile, Hundreds of protesters gathered inside the lobby of Trump Tower in New York City on Thursday, demanding the release of Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil. Khalil is currently in ICE custody in Louisiana, with the Trump administration moving forward with plans to deport him.","Columbia University has expelled students involved in last year's pro- Palestinian protests, expelling some, suspending others, and revoking the diplomas of certain graduates.

Tina Smith as Senate Democrats gathered behind closed doors to mount a last-ditch protest over a Republican-led spending bill, before announcing his support

A day after stating that Democrats will oppose the GoP funding bill, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer conceded on Thursday, announcing his readiness to proceed with a Republican-backed government funding bill that has significantly divided Democrats who sought to restrict the Trump administration .In private discussions during a heated lunch meeting and subsequent public statements before Friday's vote, the New York senator acknowledged that despite the GOP bill's flaws, a shutdown would be more detrimental, potentially giving President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk unrestricted authority in government operations, as reported by the Associated Press.""Trump has taken a blowtorch to our country and wielded chaos like a weapon,"" Schumer said. ""For Donald Trump, a shutdown would be a gift. It would be the best distraction he could ask for from his awful agenda.""This comes after Schumer on Wednesday had announced that his party members would not support the House-approved bill maintaining current federal funding levels for six months. Instead, he advocated for a one-month extension to enable Congress to evaluate individual spending bills and reach a mutually acceptable agreement. ""Our caucus is unified"" on such a measure to ""keep the government open and give Congress time to negotiate bipartisan legislation that can pass,"" Schumer had stated briefly from the floor.Thus, Schumer's shifted stance potentially resolves a prolonged impasse. Senate Democrats had initiated a final protest regarding the package, which had secured House approval without the restrictions they sought on Trump and billionaire Musk's attempts to restructure federal operations.Democratic legislators face significant pressure to counter the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, which is substantially altering established government agencies and dismissing numerous federal employees.Trump extended an offer to negotiate on Thursday: ""If they need me, I'm there 100%."" The president subsequently directed responsibility towards Democrats for potential disruptions, stating during an Oval Office meeting, ""If it shuts down, it's not the Republicans ' fault.""Democrats proposed a temporary 30-day funding measure as an alternative, but according to Schumer, Republicans rejected this proposal. Despite strategic disagreements among Democrats, they expressed concerns about potential disruption under Trump and Musk during a government closure.During an animated private lunch, Schumer informed Democrats of his intention to proceed with the bill. These details, initially reported by The New York Times, were confirmed by two anonymous sources familiar with the discussions. quoted by AP.As Thursday's Senate session began, with the Friday midnight deadline approaching, Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune declared, ""It's time for Democrats to fish or cut bait.""Regular debates about federal funding often intensify near deadlines, but this year's situation demonstrates Republicans' political advantage with their majority control of the White House and Congress, whilst highlighting Democrats' limitations in preventing the Trump administration's modifications to federal operations.House Republicans achieved an unusual unity in passing their bill, with conservatives supporting the DOGE reductions while Democrats remained opposed. The House subsequently adjourned, leaving final action to the Senate.Schumer's options remained limited, with no guarantee of final passage before the deadline.The Republican 53-47 majority requires Democratic support to achieve the necessary 60-vote threshold to overcome a filibuster.""I'm in the camp of like, don't ever, ever shut the government down,"" expressed Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa.Democrats face a crucial decision within 24 hours- provide votes to advance the package funding government operations through September's end or risk a shutdown after midnight Friday.""They'll cave,"" stated Texas GOP Sen. John Cornyn. Cornyn noted the Democrats' contradictory position of criticising Musk and the Trump administration regarding federal employee reductions whilst potentially causing complete work stoppage through a government shutdown .Meanwhile, progressive Democrats, including House allies, urged resistance against Trump, despite shutdown risks. Rep. Greg Casar, D-Texas, Congressional Progressive Caucus chair, posted that the House GOP bill will ""supercharge Musk's theft from working people to pay for billionaire tax cuts. Senate Democrats must stop it.""Unusually, the House package requires the District of Columbia to revert to 2024 levels despite having approved its balanced budget, prompting protests from city leadership warning of service reductions.

US President Donald Trump ’s border czar, Tom Homan on Wednesday warned migrant ""sanctuary"" jurisdictions, urging them to ""get out of the way"" or face an increased presence of ""exactly what they don’t want, more ICE agents in the community.""While visiting the New York state Capitol , Homan criticised Gov. Kathy Hochul and state Democrats for backing sanctuary city policies, cautioning, ""Sanctuary cities are going to get exactly what they don’t want—more agents in the community.""""You’re not going to stop us, New York state, you’ve got to change the sanctuary status.

"What is the Alien Enemies Act, meant for wartime, that Trump is expected to invoke for mass deportations?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-is-the-alien-enemies-act-meant-for-wartime-that-trump-is-expected-to-invoke-for-mass-deportations/articleshow/118993651.cms,"Donald Trump is expected to invoke Alien Enemies Act.

President Donald Trump is expected to invoke the Alien Enemies Act , reports said to give an impetus to his mass deportation programs. The Act is a wartime law that allows the president to decide to deport immigrants from an enemy nation. During his campaign, Trump said that he planned to invoke the Acy which has not been used since World War II, when it was used to detain Japanese Americans.During World War II, the Alien Enemies Act was partially used to justify the internment of Japanese immigrants who had not become U.S. citizens. The broader internment of Japanese-Americans was carried out under executive orders signed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt and not the Alien Enemies Act since the law does not apply to U.S. citizens.The other two occasions the Act was invoked were also during war.The law is designed to be invoked if the US is at war with another country, or a foreign nation has invaded the US or threatened to do so. Legal experts say it would be difficult for Trump to use the act when the US isn’t being attacked by a foreign government, even if the administration does cite threats from gangs or cartels.The primary target of the law would be Tren de Aragua , the Venezuelan organized crime group that has become active in the US. Trump earlier ordered his administration to designate Tren as a terrorist organization. Once enacted, the law will help the mass deportation programs too, experts said.The Act requires the president to declare the event that prompted the Act to be invoked. And it will remain in effect until the president terminates it.On January 20, Trump ordered his administration to prepare for the implementation of the Act is he decided that foreign drug cartels qualified as an ""invasion"" or ""predatory incursion"" for invoking the Act.","The Act is a wartime law that allows the president to decide to deport immigrants from an enemy nation.

Mysterious disappearance of Sudiksha Konanki: Here's what we know so far



What happened on March 6?



Days after dismissing the disappearance of 20-year-old University of Pittsburgh student Sudiksha Konanki -- of Indian origin -- as an accidental drowning, Dominican Republic police Thursday said they have not ruled out foul play in her disappearance as the search for her enters its seventh day. The attorney general and police in the Caribbean nation said in a release that the search for the missing co-ed now extends “beyond an accidental event” and “examines all variables.”“We are using all our resources to thoroughly investigate the disappearance of Konanki Sudiksha Chowdary and we understand the anguish this case causes to her family, Dominicans, and Americans,” Dominican Republic Attorney General Yeni Berenice Reynoso said in a statement.“As with any disappearance occurring under the circumstances of the case at hand, we are applying a holistic investigation protocol that examines all variables,” she said.“The young woman’s family, as well as Dominican and American society, must be absolutely certain that we will continue to investigate until we have the response that we, the authorities, are duty-bound to guarantee.”Interpol issued a yellow notice to wooden the search for Konanki after the Loudoun County Sheriff's office in Virginia, where Konanki's family lives, requested for it to assist in the investigation.The Dominican National Police said they were alerted on March 7 that the 20-year-old girl had gone missing. Konanki arrived in Punta Cana with five friends on March 3.Police have identified Joshua Riibe, a 24-year-old tourist from Iowa, as a person of interest in the case as he was seen last with Konanki -- as captured in surveillance cameras.Konanki's family did not accept that she had been drowned as her body had not been found even after such an intensive search for days. One possibility is that her body might have got trapped in coral reefs.Riu Republica, the resort where Konanki was staying, reportedly experienced a 25-hour power outage in some areas of the hotel before Konanki's disappearance. But the hotel said that the electricity was restored a full day before Konanki disappeared.Police said on March 6, Konanki and a group of five women and two men were seen drinking in the hotel lobby before walking to the beach around 4:15 am. Konanki, however, did not join them on the beach and stayed behind with Riibe.A local news outlet reported that a man claimed that he and Konanki went into the water. He returned to the beach and passed out, he said. When he woke up, Konanki was not there. Some of Konanki's clothes were found on a beach chair, the outlet reported.","Sudiksha Konanki, 20, went missing on March 6 in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic.

Militants hijacked a train in southwestern Pakistan on Tuesday, holding passengers hostage for nearly 36 hours. The Pakistani military later announced on Wednesday that a successful rescue operation had ended the standoff, freeing the hostages and eliminating over 30 militants.Earlier on Tuesday, Mehboob Hussain was travelling when an explosion damaged the tracks beneath the front carriage. The nine-coach Jaffar Express came to a stop in the isolated Bolan Pass of central Pakistan, an area devoid of internet and mobile connectivity. Subsequently, gunfire erupted.""I was a passenger on the train that was attacked,"" Hussain told BBC Urdu. He and roughly 440 fellow passengers were travelling from Quetta to Peshawar through Balochistan province when armed militants launched their attack, bombing the tracks, shooting at the train and boarding the carriages.Officials report that 300 passengers have been rescued, whilst 33 BLA militants, 21 civilian hostages and four military personnel lost their lives. However, fate of several passengers remains uncertain, with reports from Reuters and AFP suggesting some militants departed with an unknown number of hostages.The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), a militant separatist group operating in Pakistan's Balochistan province, quickly claimed responsibility for the train hijacking, threatening to kill hostages unless Pakistani authorities released Baloch political prisoners.BBC interviewed several witnesses who recounted the terrifying events aboard the train during the attack. ""We held our breath throughout the firing, not knowing what would happen next,"" Ishaq Noor a passenger said.A railway police officer aboard the train told the outlet that, contrary to initial official statements, the train was ""not in a tunnel but in an open area"" during the attack.The BLA has shared purported footage of the train explosion. The video displays an exposed track section alongside a substantial rocky incline. The footage shows BLA fighters positioned at the summit of this incline.The officer detailed to the BBC how he initially ""fought together with other police officers"" to resist the militants until ""the ammunition ran out"".""They [the BLA] were moving in front of us on the mountain and they were much more numerous than us, in the hundreds,"" the officer, speaking anonymously, stated.He mentioned being accompanied by four railway police and two Frontier Corps (FC) paramilitary members. ""I told my companion to give me the G-3 rifle because it is a better weapon,"" the officer explained.""When I got the rifle and the rounds, we also started firing back. I used to fire one shot at a time at them so that they could not come near us and the train... [But] in an hour-and-half, our rounds were over... We were helpless,"" he added.After the gunfire from the Jaffar Express subsided, armed militants descended from the mountains and began evacuating passengers. The officer described how they conducted identity checks and segregated hostages based on their ethnicity alongside the train.According to the passengers, the militants issued threats speaking in Balochi stating their demands to the government and warning of severe consequences, including burning the vehicle if their demands weren't met. The officer noted that the militants received instructions to execute people, targeting both military personnel and civilians from the segregated groups.The militants permitted certain groups to leave unharmed, including women, children, elderly individuals and Balochistan residents, according to Noor.Noor Muhammad, who was amongst those released, described how armed men entered the train after an hour of gunfire, demanding passengers to exit under threat.Muhammad and his wife were escorted off the train and instructed to walk straight ahead without looking back. They reached Panir Railway Station at about 1900 after a challenging journey through wilderness. His wife recounted their rescue by Pakistan military personnel who transported them safely to Machh and subsequently to their waiting children in Quetta.The police official, speaking anonymously, described how numerous BLA militants began departing as night fell. ""Many of them hugged each other and 70, 80 people left while 20, 25 stayed behind,"" he said.Violence erupted again around 10pm when some attempted to flee. ""Some people tried to run away, they [the BLA] saw them and opened fire, then everyone fell to the ground,"" the official added.Mehboob another passenger further recounted continuous gunfire throughout the night and described how a person near him, a father of five daughters, was shot.""When someone is killed in front of your eyes, you don't know what to do,"" he said.Another passenger, Allahditta, recounted how the BLA killed his cousin before his eyes. He mentioned that his cousin begged for his life, citing his young daughters, but ""his life was not spared"".The rescue operation began during Wednesday morning prayers when FC forces engaged the militants. Amidst the chaos, several hostages managed to escape.The police official described fleeing with his injured companion, carrying him beyond the firing range with assistance from another person. Mehboob, Allahdita, the police official and his companion survived the ordeal during the FC's intervention.The Balochistan Liberation Army has been fighting for an independent Baloch state and has intensified attacks in recent years, targeting security forces, infrastructure, and foreign investments, particularly Chinese projects.While the group has a history of attacking military camps, railway stations, and trains, this marked the first time they had hijacked a train.","Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) militants hijacked a train in southwestern Pakistan on Tuesday, holding passengers hostage for nearly 36 hours.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s military said it had thwarted a daring suicide attack on a Frontier Corps (FC) camp in Jandola area of Tank district, in the country’s northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, on Thursday, killing 10 suspected militants affiliated with the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).The assault on the FC (a paramilitary force), which began with a massive explosion and turned into a fierce gun battle, marks the second major militant attack in Pakistan this week, underscoring growing security threats in the region.The attack commenced in the early hours when a suicide bomber detonated a vehicle packed with explosives near the perimeter of Jandola base in the restive tribal district near the Afghan border. The blast tore through the camp’s defences, paving the way for an armed assault by TTP fighters. Security forces responded swiftly, engaging the attackers in a prolonged exchange of heavy gunfire. By mid-morning, the military declared the situation under control, reporting that all assailants had been neutralised.“The brave soldiers of the Frontier Corps stood their ground and eliminated the threat with precision,” said a spokesperson for the Pakistan military’s Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR). “Ten terrorists were sent to their deaths in this operation, proving once again our resolve to protect the nation.”While official statements did not disclose casualties among security personnel or civilians, unverified reports circulating on social media platforms, including X, suggested significant damage to the camp and hinted at dozens of potential casualties. Authorities have yet to confirm these claims, and details remain scarce as the area has been cordoned off.The TTP, a militant group seeking to overthrow Pakistani governance in the tribal regions, claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement released shortly after the incident. The assault comes just two days after another deadly attack in Balochistan, where Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) militants hijacked the Jaffar Express train, killing 21 hostages and four soldiers before being eliminated by security forces.Analysts see the Jandola attack as part of a broader resurgence of militancy in Pakistan’s border regions, fuelled by instability in neighbouring Afghanistan and the TTP’s renewed aggression. “This is a clear escalation,” said security expert Ayesha Khan in Islamabad. “The TTP is testing the military’s defences, and the proximity to the Afghan border only complicates the response.”Local residents reported hearing a loud explosion followed by hours of gunfire, with some describing the scene as chaotic. “We hid in our homes, praying it would end soon,” said Javed Khan, a shopkeeper near Jandola. “The army fought hard, but it’s a reminder that we’re never far from danger here.”",Pakistan’s military said it had thwarted a daring suicide attack on a Frontier Corps (FC) camp. 10 suspected militants affiliated with the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) were killed.

ISLAMABAD: Talks between Islamabad and Kabul aimed to resolve a grave border standoff broke down after the 17-member Afghan delegation walked out, accusing Pakistan of not taking the negotiations seriously, official sources said on Thursday.The cross-border movement of people via Torkham border crossing, a critical trade and transit point between Pakistan and Afghanistan, was abruptly suspended on Feb 21 after Pakistani and Afghan security forces developed differences over construction activities on both sides of the border. The situation worsened this month when eight people, including six troops, were injured after Pakistan and Afghan Taliban forces traded fire at the border. A number of houses, a mosque and some clearing agents’ offices were hit by artillery, and cross-border firing continued for three days.To address the issue, both sides had formed their jirgas — traditional assemblies of tribal elders and representatives — which held its first meeting this week in which both sides agreed to a ceasefire. The talks, however, broke down on Wednesday when the Afghan delegation, led by Younus Mohmand, chairman of the Afghan chamber of commerce, walked out.The Afghan delegation was surprised to find that Pakistan had expanded its delegation list without prior consultation. Instead of the agreed 17 members, Pakistan presented a list of 70 individuals, many of whom the Afghan side considered irrelevant to negotiations.After waiting two hours for a response, the Afghan jirga left for Kabul, expressing frustration with Pakistan’s approach. Mohmand criticised Pakistan’s actions, stating that the addition of unrelated individuals reflected a lack of seriousness in resolving the dispute.The collapse of talks highlights the fragile state of Afghanistan-Pakistan relations , especially over border issues like the Durand Line, which Afghanistan does not officially recognise. Pakistani customs officials at Torkham said the border closure was causing a loss of around $1.5 million daily as exports to Afghanistan have stopped. Additionally, $2 million in revenue has been lost due to suspension of imports from Afghanistan.","Talks between Islamabad and Kabul aimed to resolve a grave border standoff broke down.

On March 11, militants from the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) targeted the Jaffar Express, a passenger train traveling through the remote, mountainous region of Balochistan.

Liberation Army (BLA) targeted the Jaffar Express, a passenger train traveling through the remote, mountainous region of Balochistan. The insurgents blew up railway tracks and opened fire, forcing the train to stop inside a tunnel.

The BLA claimed to have taken over 200 hostages, including Pakistani army officers and intelligence personnel, and executed over 20 security personnel in retaliation for military action.

Security forces have rescued over 190 passengers, but dozens remain trapped, and the military operation is ongoing.

The BLA issued a 48-hour ultimatum, demanding the release of Baloch political prisoners and activists in exchange for the hostages.

Attackers specifically targeted non-locals, checking identity cards and abducting passengers identified as Punjabis.

The scale and sophistication of this attack—especially targeting a civilian train carrying over 400 passengers—signal a new level of audacity in Pakistan’s long-running insurgencies.



There is not a single inch of Balochistan left where the government can claim authority. They have lost this war—completely and irreversibly. It is over. We warned them, just as those before us warned them. But instead of listening, they mocked us. They dismissed our words as empty threats, while they fueled a system of oppression, looting, and bloodshed. Every single government—without exception—has played its role in the systematic genocide of the Baloch people. This is the one issue where every institution, every administration, every so-called leader has always stood united—against us. And rather than acknowledge their crimes, they have done what they do best: shift the blame onto others.But today, I want to make something very clear. To the federal government, to the political parties, to the judiciary, to the establishment—you have brought Balochistan to the brink of destruction with your own hands. But this time, it is beyond our control. And it is beyond yours as well. Akhtar Mengal, President of Balochistan National Party.

The big picture: A nation under siege

Afghan Taliban: A silent enabler?

Pakistan’s own leverage in Afghanistan has diminished since the Taliban takeover, as the group no longer requires Pakistani sanctuary. Islamabad may hope that Beijing will press the Taliban to take steps that reduce the TTP threat in Pakistan. This would additionally serve Chinese interests by reducing risks in Afghanistan: If cross-border terrorism decreases, Pakistan has less incentive to stage strikes in Afghanistan, where China is exploring investment possibilities. An article in Foreign Policy tilted 'Pakistan Unveils New Counterterrorism Plan'

Why it matters: A multi-front war

TTP’s cross-border safe havens:

Baloch separatism gains momentum:

ISK’s growing urban footprint:

Geopolitical implications:

China in the crosshairs

Between the lines: A crisis of strategy

Pakistan’s military-first approach to counterterrorism, while effective in eliminating individual militants, has failed to dismantle entire networks. The TTP, BLA, and ISK remain resilient, continuously adapting to counterinsurgency tactics.

Drone strikes and air raids have taken out key militant leaders, but the groups regenerate quickly due to strong recruitment pipelines.

Diplomatic pressure on Afghanistan has yielded little success, as the Taliban remains indifferent to Pakistan’s concerns.

Domestic crackdowns on terrorism have been sporadic, with no long-term deradicalization efforts to prevent future recruitment.

The new counterterrorism strategy announced by the government includes kinetic operations, legal reforms, and social interventions, but analysts warn it is too vague and lacks the resources for full implementation.

What’s next: The battle for stability

Diplomatic pressure on Afghanistan: Islamabad must seek international mediation, possibly involving China and Gulf nations, to push the Taliban into dismantling TTP sanctuaries.

Enhanced counterterrorism operations: More intelligence-based strikes and border security reinforcements to prevent cross-border militant movement.

Strengthened intelligence sharing: Pakistan must work closely with regional allies like China, Iran, and even India to disrupt terrorist funding and logistical networks.

Socioeconomic reforms: Addressing the root causes of insurgency—such as unemployment and political disenfranchisement in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa—can undercut militant recruitment.

Bottom Line

Pakistan is facing one of its most dangerous security crises in decades. The country is not just fighting a single insurgent group but is simultaneously battling four distinct yet increasingly interconnected militant organizations: Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Balochistan Liberation Army ( BLA ), Islamic State Khorasan (ISK), and the Afghan Taliban’s indirect influence.Each of these groups operates with different objectives, but together, they are tearing at the fabric of Pakistan’s security, economy, and sovereignty.With a 45% increase in terrorism-related deaths in 2024, according to the Global Terrorism Index (GTI), and an alarming rise in attacks across multiple fronts, the situation has escalated into what could be called a ""Quad of terror"".The latest train hijacking in Balochistan—a chilling display of insurgent power—has once again brought Pakistan’s security vulnerabilities to the forefront.The big question remains: Can Pakistan successfully counter this growing terrorist network, or is it on the brink of deeper instability?Pakistan’s security forces are facing unprecedented threats on multiple fronts. The Global Terrorism Index (GTI) 2025, released earlier this month, ranked Pakistan as the second most terrorism-affected country globally, a grim ascent from its fourth-place position the previous year.The report documented a 45% increase in terrorism-related deaths, rising from 748 in 2023 to 1,081 in 2024. This spike is attributed largely to the resurgence of the TTP, alongside intensified attacks by the BLA and the growing influence of ISK, with the Afghan Taliban’s role adding a complex layer to the crisis.The four insurgent groups—each with its own goals—are increasingly operating in a way that overlaps and amplifies each other’s impact:The TTP, emboldened by the Taliban’s 2021 victory in Afghanistan, has intensified its attacks. The porous Pakistan-Afghanistan border has become a logistical hub for its fighters, allowing them to regroup and strike Pakistani forces with increasing frequency.Operating primarily in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and along the Afghan border, the TTP has emerged as Pakistan’s most lethal insurgent group. The GTI notes a 90% surge in TTP-linked deaths in 2024, with the group responsible for 558 fatalities across 482 attacks—the highest number since 2011. The TTP has benefited from safe havens in Afghanistan, which have allowed it to regroup and plan large-scale attacks, including suicide bombings targeting security forces.The BLA has escalated its insurgency, particularly targeting state infrastructure, military personnel, and Chinese investment projects under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).The train hijacking is only the latest in a string of deadly attacks, following a January suicide bombing in Quetta that killed 25 people, including Chinese engineers.ISK has been expanding its footprint in Pakistan, staging high-profile suicide bombings, including a February 28 attack on a seminary in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa that killed six people, including a prominent cleric. The group, though ideologically at odds with the Taliban, thrives in the chaos created by Pakistan’s internal conflict.Though not directly attacking Pakistan, the Afghan Taliban has been accused of providing tacit support to the TTP. A UN report from February 2025 confirmed that the Taliban continues to offer logistical and financial backing to the TTP, hosting training centers in Afghan provinces like Kunar and Nangarhar. This relationship has strained Pakistan’s ties with Kabul, with Islamabad demanding action against TTP sanctuaries—requests that have largely been ignored.These groups, operating separately but often exploiting the same weaknesses in Pakistan’s security apparatus, present a nightmare scenario for law enforcement and military planners.Pakistan has faced terrorism before, but this is different. The simultaneous resurgence of multiple insurgent factions—each with its own motivations but overlapping operational capacities—makes this an unprecedented crisis.The Afghan Taliban’s reluctance to act against the TTP has emboldened the group, giving it a ""strategic depth"" that Pakistani forces struggle to neutralize.The BLA’s focus on targeting military personnel and Chinese investments threatens both national security and crucial economic projects like CPEC.While previously contained in Afghanistan, ISK is now targeting Pakistani cities, aiming to destabilize urban centers through sectarian violence and suicide bombings.A weakened Pakistan is vulnerable to external manipulation, with both regional and global consequences—including concerns over nuclear security.China, Pakistan’s closest strategic ally, is increasingly becoming a target of the ""Quad of terror"".The BLA, in particular, has escalated attacks on Chinese nationals and projects under CPEC, seeing them as symbols of Pakistan’s exploitation of Balochistan’s resources.In February 2025, a suicide bombing near the Gwadar Port killed four Chinese engineers, the latest in a series of attacks against Beijing’s interests in Pakistan.The TTP and ISK have also expressed hostility toward China, with ISK launching a 2024 attack on the Chinese consulate in Karachi. These groups, viewing China as an ally of the Pakistani state, have intensified their efforts to disrupt Chinese investments, raising concerns in Beijing about Pakistan’s ability to secure its economic corridor.Pakistan’s survival against this 'Quad of terror' depends on a multi-pronged approach:Pakistan stands at a critical crossroads. The escalating multi-front insurgency is stretching its security forces to the limit, while diplomatic efforts with Afghanistan remain stalled. With the TTP, BLA, ISK, and the Taliban all exerting influence, Pakistan must urgently adapt its counterterrorism strategy to meet this new reality.Failure to do so could push the country into deeper instability, economic collapse, and even territorial fragmentation—an outcome with dire consequences for South Asian and global security.(With inputs from agencies)","Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) targeted the Jaffar Express, a passenger train traveling through the remote, mountainous region of Balochistan.

DHAKA: Amid growing protests against attacks on women and rising incidents of rape, Bangladesh police on Thursday imposed restrictions on all kinds of meetings, rallies, gatherings, processions and showdowns in key locations for an indefinite period.Areas under restriction include the official residence of chief adviser Mohammad Yunus, the secretariat and nearby locations. Bangladesh has witnessed intensified demonstrations in recent days, with protesters demanding resignation of the home adviser for failure to ensure safety and security of citizens, especially women and girls.Meanwhile, the Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council issued a press note stating that 92 incidents of violence targeting minorities and indigenous peoples occurred in the first two months of this year. It is worth noting that in the five months — from Aug 4 to Dec 31 of last year — there were 2,184 attacks targeting minorities, the group said.","Bangladesh police impose restrictions on all kinds of meetings, rallies, gatherings, processions and showdowns in key locations for an indefinite period.

Dozens of Tibetan protesters clashed with police outside the Chinese Embassy in New Delhi on Monday as Tibetans living in exile marked the 66th anniversary of their uprising against China that was crushed by Chinese forces.As in past years, police blocked the protesters from entering the embassy and briefly detained some of them after wrestling them to the ground.Hundreds also marched in the north Indian town of Dharamshala, the seat of the exiled Tibetan government and home of Dalai Lama , their 89-year-old spiritual leader. Separately, about a hundred Tibetan women gathered at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi, an area designated for protests close to Parliament.The protesters shouted anti-China slogans, carried Tibetan flags and played the national anthems of Tibet and India.India considers Tibet to be part of China, although it hosts the Tibetan exiles. The 1959 independence uprising was quelled by the Chinese army, forcing Dalai Lama and his followers into exile in India.Many had their faces painted in colors of the Tibetan national flag. The demonstrators observed a minute of silence to remember Tibetans who lost their lives in the struggle against China. Monks, activists, nuns and schoolchildren marched across the town with banners reading, ""Free Tibet"" and ""Remember, Resist, Return.""Penpa Tsering - the president of the Central Tibetan Administration, as the exiled Tibetan government calls itself - accused China's leadership of carrying out a ""deliberate and dangerous strategy to eliminate the very identity of the Tibetan people.""""This marks the darkest and most critical period in the history of Tibet,"" Tsering told the gathering. ""As we commemorate the Tibetan National Uprising Day, we honor our brave martyrs, and express solidarity with our brothers and sisters inside Tibet who continue to languish under the oppressive Chinese government.""The Tibetan government-in-exile in India accuses China of denying the most fundamental human rights to people in Tibet and trying to expunge the Tibetan identity .China claims Tibet has been part of its territory for centuries, but the Tibetans say the Himalayan region was virtually independent until China occupied it in 1950.The Dalai Lama denies China's claim that he is a separatist and says he only advocates substantial autonomy and protection of Tibet's native Buddhist culture.","Tibetans living in exile mark the 66th anniversary of their uprising against China.

Nepal’s former King Gyanendra Shah was greeted with the chants of ""come king, save the nation"" by thousands of his supporters as he arrived in Kathmandu on Sunday, amid growing calls for the reinstatement of the monarchy and Nepal’s status as a Hindu state.According to the news agency AFP, Shah’s supporters waved Nepal’s flag and chanted slogans like ""Come king, save the nation!"" as the 77-year-old former monarch stepped out of Tribhuvan International Airport following a tour of western Nepal.The crowd, which included members of the pro-monarchist Rastriya Prajatantra Party , carried placards reading ""We want our King back"" and ""Abolish federal republican system and reinstate the monarchy.""AP reported that an estimated 10,000 supporters gathered outside the airport, blocking its main entrance. Passengers were forced to walk to and from the airport due to the heavy crowd. Riot police were deployed to prevent demonstrators from entering the premises, but no violence was reported.Nepal abolished its 240-year-old monarchy in 2008 after a decade-long civil war that left over 16,000 dead. However, dissatisfaction with political instability, corruption and economic struggles has fuelled a resurgence of support for the former royal family.“The country faces instability, prices are high, people are jobless, and there is a lack of education and healthcare facilities,” said Rajindra Kunwar, a teacher who joined the rally who was quoted by AFP. “The poor are dying of hunger. The law applies to the public, but not to politicians. That’s why we need the king back”, Kunwar added.Nepal has had 13 different governments since 2008, with growing frustration over governance issues. Some protesters, including those who previously supported the abolition of the monarchy, have now changed their stance. “I was in the protests that took away monarchy, hoping it would help the country, but I was mistaken,” said Kulraj Shrestha, a carpenter. “The nation has further plunged, so I have changed my mind”, Shrestha added.Gyanendra, who has generally remained silent on political matters, has made several public appearances recently. On the eve of Nepal’s Democracy Day last month, he issued a statement saying, ""It is now time. If we wish to save our nation and maintain national unity, I call on all countrymen to support us for Nepal's prosperity and progress.""Despite the rising pro-monarchy sentiment, political analyst Lok Raj Baral told AFP that the monarchy's return is unlikely, stating that it was ""a source of instability."" He added, ""For some disgruntled groups, it has become a retreat due to the incompetence of politicians.""As per PTI, security was heightened in Kathmandu, with dozens of riot policemen deployed around Narayanhiti Palace Museum, the former royal residence. There were rumours that Gyanendra might attempt to enter the palace with his supporters but the former king proceeded to his private residence, Nirmal Niwas, without any incident.The movement for the monarchy’s restoration has been gaining traction since February, when Gyanendra’s Democracy Day statement reignited debate on Nepal’s future political system.Bollywood actress Manisha Koirala, who is the granddaughter of Nepal’s first elected Prime Minister BP Koirala, urged Nepalis on social media to gather at the airport to welcome the former monarch.","Nepal's former King Gyanendra Shah greeted with chants of ""come king, save the nation"" by thousands of his supporters as he arrived in Kathmandu on Sunday.

Can Gyanendra return to power?

Chants of ""Long live our beloved king"" and ""Vacate the royal palace for the king"" echoed through the streets of Kathmandu on Sunday as thousands of supporters of Nepal's former king, Gyanendra Shah , gathered to demand the restoration of the monarchy and Hinduism as the state religion.An estimated 10,000 royalists blocked the main entrance to Tribhuvan International Airport as Gyanendra returned from a tour of western Nepal. Protesters waved flags and carried banners calling for the former king’s reinstatement. The demonstration disrupted airport operations, forcing passengers to walk to and from the terminal, while hundreds of riot police prevented demonstrators from entering the airport. Despite the intensity of the protest, no violence was reported.Nepal abolished its 239-year-old monarchy in 2008, two years after massive street protests forced Gyanendra to step down from absolute rule. The country became a federal democratic republic, but since then, many Nepalis have grown frustrated with political instability and economic struggles.Since the abolition of the monarchy, Nepal has seen 13 different governments, leading many to believe the current system has failed. Corruption, economic hardship, and lack of political stability have left some citizens reconsidering their stance on monarchy.""We are here to give the king our full support and to rally behind him all the way to reinstating him in the royal throne,"" said Thir Bahadur Bhandari, a 72-year-old protester.Kulraj Shrestha, a 50-year-old carpenter, admitted he had initially opposed the monarchy but had since changed his mind. ""I was in the protests that took away monarchy, hoping it would help the country, but I was mistaken. The nation has further plunged, so I have changed my mind,"" he said.Despite the growing support, Gyanendra has not commented on the renewed calls for his return. Political analysts believe his chances of regaining the throne remain slim in the near future. The republic is constitutionally enshrined, and mainstream political parties remain opposed to reinstating the monarchy.Gyanendra, who first became king in 2002 after the tragic massacre of his brother King Birendra and his family, initially ruled as a constitutional monarch. However, in 2005, he seized absolute power, dissolving the government and parliament, jailing politicians and journalists, and imposing emergency rule. His authoritarian rule led to the mass protests that ultimately resulted in the abolition of the monarchy.","Nepal abolished its 239-year-old monarchy in 2008, two years after massive street protests forced Gyanendra to step down from absolute rule.

Ongoing global criticism



International pressure and Taliban's isolation



On International Women's Day, the Taliban issued a statement asserting their commitment to safeguarding the rights of Afghan women.Chief spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid posted on his official X account, stating that the ''Islamic Emirate assumes full responsibility for the provision and safeguarding of the rights of Afghan women.''Without directly referencing International Women's Day, Mujahid said that dignity, honor, and legal rights for women remain a priority for the Taliban government.He claimed that Afghan women ''live in security, both physically and psychologically''and that their ''fundamental rights'' — such as autonomy in marital decisions, dowry entitlements, and inheritance — are protected.The Taliban's statement comes as the United Nations continues to denounce the severe restrictions on Afghan women.Since seizing control in 2021, the Taliban have imposed sweeping bans on education and employment for women. Girls were barred from secondary education, and later, from attending and teaching at Kabul University.In August 2023, the Vice and Virtue Ministry expanded restrictions, prohibiting women's voices in public and mandating full face coverings outside the home.On Saturday, the UN renewed its call for these bans to be lifted. ''The erasure of women and girls from public life cannot be ignored,'' said Roza Otunbayeva, head of the UN mission in Afghanistan.Alison Davidian, special representative for UN Women Afghanistan, added, ""We must stand with Afghan women as if our own lives depend on it — because they do.""Mujahid emphasized distinctions in Afghan and Western notions of women's rights. He said ''Afghan women's rights are situated within the specific context of an Islamic and Afghan society, which exhibits distinct divergences from Western societies and their cultural paradigms.''The Taliban remain globally isolated, with no official recognition as running Afghanistan's government due to their policies on women. In January, the International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor requested arrest warrants for two senior Taliban officials for their role in repressing Afghan women.Last Friday, Unesco hosted a high-level conference on women and girls in Afghanistan, featuring activists, parliamentarians, and rights experts. They included Hamida Aman, founder of the women-only station Radio Begum, former Afghan lawmaker Fawzia Koofi and human rights expert Richard Bennett, who has been barred from entering Afghanistan.In response, Saif ul-Islam Khyber, a spokesman for the Vice and Virtue Ministry, dismissed such gatherings, calling them an ''exposure of the hypocrisy of certain organizations and European Union foundations.''","The Taliban issued a statement asserting their commitment to safeguarding the rights of Afghan women.

DHAKA: Chief adviser Muhammad Yunus voiced strong concern over recent reports of attacks on women, calling them ""deeply troubling"" and a clear deviation from the vision of a ""New Bangladesh"" that the nation's people strive for.His comment, made at an International Women's Day event, came in the aftermath of the harrowing plight of an eight-year-old girl who is fighting for her life after being allegedly raped. This case is not an isolated incident but part of a broader, grim trend of sexual violence that has plagued the country. Reports of rape, gang rape, sexual assault and harassment have become disturbingly frequent.Addressing the situation of violence against women in Bangladesh that remained troubling since last year, with shocking numbers reported in the first two months, Fauzia Moslem, president of Bangladesh Mahila Parishad, said, ""Society is descending into chaos, where lawlessness and criminal impunity are growing. The failure of law enforcement, compromises, and lack of accountability are empowering criminals.""A report by the Manabadhikar Shongskriti Foundation (MSF) in Dhaka revealed that Feb 2025 documented 295 incidents of violence against women and children, 24 more than in Jan. It noted that Islamic fundamentalist groups, terrorists, and other extremist elements play a visible role in these incidents.A total of 21 women from various professions told local media that they experienced sexual harassment outside the home in past three months. The women, aged between 19 and 48 and residing in Dhaka, reported multiple instances.According to Dhaka-based human rights organisation Ain o Salish Kendra, in Feb, 46 women were victims of rape, 22 of whom were under 18. In Jan, this number was 39, including 15 minors.(With inputs from ANI)","Chief adviser Muhammad Yunus voiced strong concern over recent reports of attacks on women.

Delhi tries last-resort attempt to appeal Sanjay Bhandari extradition judgment,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/delhi-tries-last-resort-attempt-to-appeal-sanjay-bhandari-extradition-judgment/articleshow/118990729.cms,"Sanjay Bhandari

LONDON: The Indian govt has applied to the London high court for a point of law of general public importance to be certified to allow India to appeal the Sanjay Bhandari extradition judgment in Britain’s Supreme Court.The Indian authorities are seeking to extradite Bhandari (62), a defence middleman residing in London, to face criminal charges of money laundering and wilfully evading taxes in India by not declaring foreign assets and foreign income on his Indian income tax returns, claiming he evaded Rs 197 crore in taxes, contrary to Sec 51 of the Black Money Act.In the tax years 2012 to 2013 and 2015 to 2016 Bhandari, an Indian national, declared he had nil foreign assets despite having amassed Rs 731 crore of foreign assets, the charges state.On Feb 28 two high court judges, Lord Justice Holroyde and Mrs Justice Steyn, ordered Bhandari’s discharge on two grounds, namely that his extradition him to India would be a breach of both Articles 3 (torture) and 6 (fair trial) of the ECHR ( European Convention on Human Rights ).The judges said he would be at real risk of extortion, accompanied by violence, from other prisoners, and also from prison officials inside Tihar jail — where he would be detained — as he was “perceived to be rich”.They commented that “incidents of prison officials, including senior officials, taking bribes, engaging in, and facilitating, extortion, occur all too commonly” in Tihar jail and the risk was not removed by India’s assurances, amounting to an ECHR Article 3 breach.They also said because Bhandari would have to prove the attempt to evade tax was not wilful, rather than prosecuting authorities having to prove it was wilful, this was a flagrant denial of his rights under Article 6.A high court official told TOI: “An application was filed on Wednesday by the respondent (Indian govt) to certify two points of law of general public importance; and grant leave to appeal to the Supreme Court in relation to those two questions.”TOI understands that Delhi’s argument is that reversing the burden of proof is not a “flagrant denial of justice” as per Article 6. Delhi also claims that it should have been asked to provide further assurances about Bhandari’s treatment in Tihar jail rather than the extradition being turned down under Article 3.Bhandari, represented by Edward Fitzgerald KC, had appealed in the high court under six grounds, but the other four grounds were dismissed.","The Indian govt has applied to the London high court for a point of law of general public importance to allow India to appeal the Sanjay Bhandari extradition judgment in Britain’s Supreme Court.

LONDON: UK’s govt is to abolish the £200 billion NHS England to cut bureaucracy and duplication with the department of health and bring it back under govt control, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced in a speech on Thursday.Starmer said this would shift money back to the front line and bring the NHS “back into democratic control”. “That money could and should be spent on nurses, doctors, operations and GP appointments”, not on an arms-length body, he said.“By abolishing NHS England, that will put the NHS back at the heart of govt where it belongs, freeing it to focus on patients with less bureaucracy and more money for nurses,” he explained.The news follows the departure of senior leaders at NHS England in recent weeks, including NHS chief executive Amanda Pritchard.Health secretary Wes Streeting told the Commons that NHS England was “the biggest quango in the world” and there were twice as many staff in NHS England and the health department as in 2010 when the NHS had the shortest waiting times and highest patient satisfaction.“Today NHS delivers worse care for patients but is more expensive than ever before,” Streeting said. “The budget for NHS England staff has soared to £2 billion.”“Such bloated and inefficient bureaucracy cannot be justified. Frontline NHS staff are drowning in micromanagement subjected to by vast layers of bureaucracy,” he said.Streeting said there are 15,300 staff in NHS England and 3,300 in the department of health and social care. “Across both we’re looking to reduce the overall headcount by 50%. That will deliver hundreds of millions of pounds worth of savings.” It will mean “fewer checkers and more doers”, he said.Integration of NHS England and his department has begun and will be complete in two years. The Tories welcomed the announcement.But Dr Ramesh Mehta, president of the British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (BAPIO), was taken aback by the decision which he said had been taken without consulting staff and questioned whether it had been done with proper thought.“There have been several reorganisations of the NHS over the years and bureaucracy creeps in all the time. It is a sad state of affairs that every new govt brings changes and there is no continuity.” He agreed the NHS was in the worst state it has ever been, with long waiting times and huge patient dissatisfaction, and said workforce management was “chaotic”.“Will abolishing NHS England resolve all this? If politicians run the NHS, that is not good news. It should be run by professionals. The issue is it never has enough money,” Mehta said.",UK's govt is to abolish the £200 billion NHS England to cut bureaucracy and duplication.

UK’s Queen Camilla sent a private letter of support to French rape survivor Gisèle Pelicot , recognising her “extraordinary dignity and courage”, reported Newsweek quoting a palace aide.""She was tremendously affected by the Madame Pelicot case in France and that lady’s extraordinary dignity and courage as she put herself in the public eye,"" a palace source was quoted as saying by the news outlet. ""Because, as she rightly put it, why should she be made to feel like a victim or hide away in shame?”, the source added.According to Newsweek, The Queen wanted to reach out personally to acknowledge Pelicot’s resilience and the impact she has made in highlighting a significant societal issue.""So, as a long-term supporter of survivors of domestic and sexual abuse, the Queen wrote to Madame Pelicot privately. It was very much her instigation and determination to write to express support from the highest level,"" the source said.Pelicot, 72, endured nearly a decade of horrific abuse at the hands of her former husband, Dominique Pelicot, who drugged, raped, and filmed her, while also enlisting dozens of other men to do the same.The abuse, which occurred between 2011 and 2020, was uncovered when Dominique was caught filming women up their skirts in a supermarket. Upon investigation, authorities discovered a hard drive containing over 200 videos documenting the crimes.Dominique Pelicot was sentenced to 20 years in prison in December 2024 after standing trial alongside 50 co-defendants, most of whom were also convicted of rape or sexual assault. The scale of the abuse made it France’s largest-ever rape trial, drawing widespread media attention.Gisèle Pelicot made headlines for waiving her anonymity and choosing to face her 51 alleged rapists in court. She explained her decision as an effort to make the ""shame swap sides"", ensuring that perpetrators, not victims, carried the stigma of sexual violence. Her bravery earned her praise across France and internationally, with supporters lining up outside the court to applaud her and present her with flowers, BBC reported.Queen Camilla has been an active advocate against domestic and sexual violence for years. In November, ITV aired a documentary following her campaign work, where she urged for a cultural shift to end violence against women and open conversations on abuse.She has also visited numerous charities supporting survivors. In February, she visited Brave Spaces in Exeter, England, which is a two-year test and learn project and supports women facing multiple disadvantages, homelessness, trauma, and domestic and sexual violence. There she met women rebuilding their lives after domestic violence.""The Queen is a great advocate for women,"" Newsweek quoted Afnan Tellesy, 37, after meeting Camilla at the charity.","Queen Camilla writes to French rape survivor Gisèle Pelicot in a gesture of support.

Tories table bill amendments to deport foreign criminals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/tories-table-bill-amendments-to-deport-foreign-criminals/articleshow/118903414.cms,"File photo

LONDON: The opposition Conservative party in Britain has announced plans for a tough new crackdown on illegal migration and on foreign nationals, including Indians, who commit crimes in the UK.The Tories on Monday revealed they have tabled amendments to Labour’s Borders Bill which will require the UK govt to stop issuing visas to nationals of countries who do not take back their own citizens – including criminals – that Britain wishes to deport.They have also tabled an amendment to require a foreign national convicted of any crime to be removed from the UK, as well as anyone who has been charged with, or convicted of, immigration offences.This replaces current provisions where a prison sentence of one year is required before removal is required, and even then removal can be frustrated by asylum and human rights claims.The amendment will end exceptions granted by modern slavery, human rights and asylum laws.This is on top of the proposal announced at the weekend to disapply the Human Rights Act for immigration matters so that UK courts can only follow UK law.Around 100,000 Indian citizens are estimated to be in Britain illegally.In 2021, the UK and India signed an MoU on a migration and mobility partnership that included provisions on returns. Of the roughly 22,800 people who left the UK via enforced or voluntary return in the year ending Sept 30, 2023, 15% (3,439) were Indian, according to the Migration Observatory. Two hundred and ninety-two Indians arrived in the UK illegally on small boats in 2024.As of Dec 31, 2024, there were 305 Indian citizens in prison in the UK, according to statistics from UK’s ministry of justice.Separate stats, obtained by the Daily Telegraph under freedom of information laws, show Indian nationals were convicted of 3,242 crimes between 2021 and 2023 – a crime rate of 93.4 per 10,000 residents. Of these 148 were sexual, accounting for the third highest number of sex offence convictions.The Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill is at committee stage and has two sittings this week.The proposed clauses by the Tories are already on the amendment paper and will be voted on by the bill committee.A Conservative party spokesman said: “Some countries refuse to take back their own citizens with no right to be in the UK – so it is reasonable that the UK does not issue visas to nationals of those countries. This will encourage countries to take their own citizens back.""It has been reported that Pakistan refused to take back Rochdale grooming gang ringleader Qari Abdul Rauf despite multiple attempts to deport him. He has been released from prison and remains in the UK.MP Chris Philp, shadow home secretary, said: “These tough new measures show the Conservatives are prepared to do whatever it takes to deport foreign criminals from the UK. If a foreign citizen commits a crime here, we should kick them out – it is as simple as that. And where another country won’t take back their own citizens – including criminals – then the govt must stop issuing new visas to people from those countries.”However, a UK govt spokesperson described the amendments as ""unworkable and unrealistic"" and signalled it would not support them.The govt spokesperson said: “To ensure people can be sent back to their home country we need steadfast, long-term agreements and close collaboration with key international partners. We are introducing tougher restrictions, including the use of electronic tags and curfews, on those whose removal we are pursuing but we are presently unable to deport.""","Opposition Conservative party in Britain has announced plans for a tough new crackdown on illegal migration and on foreign nationals, including Indians, who commit crimes in the UK. The Tories on Monday revealed they have tabled amendments to Labour’s Borders Bill which will require the UK govt to stop issuing visas to nationals of countries who do not take back their own citizens.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118903484,imgsize-224876,width-400,resizemode-4/118903484.jpg"
NHS England announces large-scale cuts as part of government shake-up,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/nhs-england-announces-large-scale-cuts-as-part-of-government-shake-up/articleshow/118880910.cms,"The UK government has announced major cuts to NHS England as part of a strategy to streamline operations and reduce duplication with the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC). Around 6,500 jobs, nearly half of NHS England's workforce, will be cut, aiming to save £175 million annually, BBC reported.This follows news that several senior board members, including chief executive Amanda Pritchard and medical director Sir Stephen Powis, will leave the organisation. NHS staff have expressed shock and concern at the scale of the cuts, which far exceed the 2,000 job losses initially proposed.The restructuring will also impact the DHSC, which will undergo downsizing while working more closely with NHS England. These changes are expected to give Health Secretary Wes Streeting greater control over the NHS's operations. The move marks a significant overhaul of the NHS's national framework, the largest in over a decade, according to Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation.NHS England stated that the workforce reductions are necessary to make better use of taxpayer money and improve the efficiency of frontline services. The reshaping process follows previous job cuts in recent years, including reductions of 4,000 to 6,000 employees at NHS England and 800 at the DHSC.The announcement of these cuts, which will take effect from April 2025, has left staff feeling unsettled, but the NHS is putting a transition team in place to guide the changes. Pritchard acknowledged the unsettling nature of the news but emphasised the need for radical reform. The focus will be on eliminating redundancies between the two organisations and ensuring a more integrated and efficient health system.","Around 6,500 jobs, nearly half of NHS England's workforce, will be cut.

LONDON: A man was arrested early Sunday after he climbed the Big Ben tower at the Palace of Westminster in central London while barefoot and holding a Palestinian flag. The man, who appeared to be staging a protest on a ledge several metres (yards) up Elizabeth Tower, which houses Big Ben, stepped off the building after midnight and onto a cherry picker following a long conversation with negotiators. He got into a waiting ambulance.Traffic around the Palace of Westminster in London had come to a standstill for much of Saturday as emergency crews tried to reach the man. Negotiators were lifted up on a fire brigade ladder platform several times before eventually talking him down.Westminster Bridge and a nearby street were closed for much of the day and several emergency services vehicles were at the scene as crowds looked on. Police also blocked off all pedestrian access to Parliament Square. A small group of supporters shouted ""Free Palestine"" from behind a police cordon nearby.Officials said tours of the Houses of Parliament were cancelled because of the incident.The Metropolitan Police confirmed that the man has now been arrested.""This has been a protracted incident due to the specifics of where the man was located and the need to ensure the safety of our officers, the individual and the wider public,"" it said in a statement.",Man with Palestinian flag arrested after climbing London's Big Ben tower.

'It’s time to make Putin pay': Rishi Sunak urges seizing $300 billion in Russian assets to rebuild Ukraine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/its-time-to-make-putin-pay-rishi-sunak-urges-seizing-300-billion-in-russian-assets-to-rebuild-ukraine/articleshow/118818058.cms,"Rishi Sunak

Former British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has called on Western nations to seize $300 billion in frozen Russian state assets , insisting that Moscow must be held accountable for the devastation caused by its invasion of Ukraine, saying, “It’s time to make Putin pay.”He argued that Western taxpayers should not bear the burden of rebuilding a country that Russia has destroyed.“Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has caused $524 billion in destruction – devastating cities, industries, and lives,” Sunak said. “The world must ensure that Russia, not Western taxpayers, foots the bill for Ukraine’s recovery.”Seizing these assets, he said, would not only help rebuild Ukraine but also ease financial pressure on allied nations and send a clear message that aggression will not pay. While some claim confiscating Russian funds would violate international law, Sunak dismissed those concerns, citing legal pathways outlined by experts, including those at the Hoover Institution . He pointed out that the West already uses the interest from these assets to support Ukraine, arguing that if that is legal, so is using the capital itself. “The principle is clear: if you destroy another nation, you should pay for the damage,” he said.Addressing concerns that such a move could undermine trust in Western financial systems, Sunak argued that Russia had already attempted to move its reserves before invading Ukraine and that rogue states have few safe alternatives. He called on the European Union, which holds a significant portion of the frozen Russian assets, to take decisive action. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk and Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala have also voiced their support for seizing the funds according to Sunak. “Ukraine shouldn’t be left waiting while its cities remain in ruins,” Sunak said.Earlier this week, Sunak had also weighed in on the recent Oval Office meeting between US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, which reportedly turned tense over a mineral deal seen as key to continued US support. Trump and his Vice President, JD Vance, accused Zelenskyy of not showing enough gratitude, leading to a heated exchange. According to BBC, Sunak condemned Trump’s treatment of the Ukrainian leader, saying, “It was very hard to watch. For him to have been treated that way was wrong.”Reinforcing the urgency of his call, Sunak stressed that Ukraine’s future depends on decisive action. Seizing Russian assets, he said, would not only fund reconstruction but also strengthen Ukraine’s military, deterring future Russian aggression. “If we let Russia off the hook, we set a dangerous precedent for other aggressors. That’s why we must act,” he said.","Former British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has called on Western nations to seize $300 billion in frozen Russian state assets.

US President Donald Trump has threatened to impose 200 per cent tariff on wine, champagne, and other alcoholic beverages imported from France and other European Union (EU) countries, escalating a trade dispute over tariffs on American whiskey.In a post on his Truth Social platform on Thursday, Trump warned, “If this Tariff is not removed immediately, the US will shortly place a 200 per cent Tariff on all wines, champagnes & alcoholic products coming out of France and other EU represented countries.”He added that such a move would benefit the wine and champagne industry in the US.Trump’s remarks follow the European Commission’s decision on Wednesday to impose a 50 per cent tariff on American whiskey, as part of a broader response to US tariffs on steel and aluminum, CNN stated.The EU also announced plans to introduce counter-tariffs worth €26 billion ($28 billion) on various US goods starting next month, according to Reuters.Trump called the EU’s tariff on American bourbon “nasty”.Trump, who has long criticised EU trade policies, described the bloc as “one of the most hostile and abusive taxing and tariffing authorities in the World, which was formed for the sole purpose of taking advantage of the United States.”","US President Donald Trump has threatened to impose 200 per cent tariff on wine, champagne, and other alcoholic beverages imported from France and other European Union countries.

US sends top negotiators to Russia for ceasefire talks

Kremlin aide Ushakov dismisses ceasefire as offering 'nothing' to Russia

Russia claims capture of Sudzha, a key Ukrainian-held town

Russia rules out foreign peacekeepers in Ukraine

US resumes military aid to Ukraine ahead of negotiations

Russia and the US have intensified diplomatic contacts

Ukraine’s battlefield position weakens as Russian advances continue

Kremlin signals demand for sanctions relief in any deal

Continued fighting despite ongoing ceasefire discussions

(With inputs from agencies)

Diplomatic efforts to secure a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine have intensified, with the United States proposing a 30-day halt to hostilities. While Ukraine has agreed to the proposal, Russia remains non-committal. Kremlin officials have not said that a temporary ceasefire would favor Kyiv rather than serve Moscow’s strategic interests.Meanwhile, Russia claims to have seized the key Ukrainian-held town of Sudzha, and US negotiators have arrived in Moscow to discuss the ceasefire proposal. With both military and diplomatic tensions escalating, the world watches to see if a breakthrough is possible.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has voiced his frustration over Russia's lack of engagement with the US-proposed ceasefire plan. “Regrettably, there has been no meaningful response from Moscow,” he said.""Regrettably, for more than a day already, the world has yet to hear a meaningful response from Russia to the proposals made. This once again demonstrates that Russia seeks to prolong the war and postpone peace for as long as possible. We hope that US pressure will be sufficient to compel Russia to end the war,"" Zelensky said in a statement on social media.A delegation of US officials, including Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff, has arrived in Moscow to present the ceasefire proposal. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed that National Security Advisor Mike Waltz had spoken with his Russian counterpart before the talks. Trump remains hopeful, stating, “People are going to Russia right now as we speak. And hopefully, we can get a ceasefire from Russia.”Kremlin foreign policy adviser Yuri Ushakov has strongly criticised the proposed ceasefire, arguing that it would provide Ukraine with a chance to regroup while offering no strategic benefit to Russia. ""A temporary 30-day ceasefire would give nothing to Russia,"" he said. His remarks reflect growing skepticism within the Kremlin about the US-backed proposal, with officials insisting that any agreement must take Moscow’s interests into account.Russia’s defence ministry announced that it has taken control of Sudzha, a strategically important town in the Kursk region. The claim came just hours after President Vladimir Putin visited his military commanders in the area. While Ukrainian officials have not confirmed the loss, Ukraine’s top military head, Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi, acknowledged that Russian airstrikes had “almost completely destroyed” the town. The loss of Sudzha, if true, would mark a significant setback for Kyiv.The Kremlin has firmly rejected any proposal that involves the deployment of foreign peacekeepers in Ukraine as part of a ceasefire or long-term security arrangement. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova stated, “It is absolutely unacceptable to us that army units of other states are stationed in Ukraine under any flag.” Moscow has repeatedly warned that the presence of foreign troops would escalate the conflict rather than resolve it.In a significant move, the US has resumed its military support for Ukraine after a temporary pause. Washington still has $3.85 billion in authorized funding for arms shipments, though the Trump administration has been cautious about committing additional aid. The decision to restart military assistance signals that the US remains committed to supporting Kyiv, even as it pursues diplomatic solutions.Maria Zakharova confirmed that Russia and the US have ramped up diplomatic efforts, with embassies and diplomats engaging in more active discussions. This follows a February 12 phone call between Presidents Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump, during which both leaders agreed to work toward repairing bilateral relations and seeking an end to the war in Ukraine. “Contacts with the US administration are becoming more active,” Zakharova said.Ukraine is facing increasing military pressure, with Russian forces making significant territorial gains. The loss of Sudzha would further weaken Kyiv’s position, as Ukraine initially seized the town to create leverage for future peace talks. With Russian troops advancing and US military aid uncertain, Ukraine’s ability to sustain its defensive lines is becoming increasingly difficult.Moscow has indicated that it wants sanctions relief to be part of any ceasefire agreement. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stated that Russia considers the sanctions “illegal,” but declined to provide details on whether lifting them was a condition for negotiations. “Let us not get ahead of ourselves,” he said. The US has warned that if Moscow refuses to engage in serious peace efforts, new sanctions could be imposed.Despite diplomatic talks, the battlefield remains active. Russia claimed to have shot down 77 Ukrainian drones overnight, while Ukraine’s air force reported intercepting dozens of Russian drones targeting multiple regions. These ongoing attacks highlight the fragile nature of the ceasefire negotiations, with both sides unwilling to reduce hostilities until a concrete agreement is reached.","Diplomatic efforts to secure a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine have intensified.

Albania TikTok ban to begin Thursday,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/albania-tiktok-ban-to-begin-thursday/articleshow/118976560.cms,"Where else is TikTok banned?

TikTok will be blocked in Albania for one year, starting Thursday. The Chinese-owned social media app has roughly 1.5 million users in the Balkan nation.According to local media, the Albanian Authority for Electronic and Postal Communications has ordered all internet service providers to block access to the app's servers and provide written proof.The ban was first announced in December by Prime Minister Edi Rama. The decision came after an escalation between teenagers on the platform resulted in a brawl that left a 14-year-old dead and another seriously injured.The killing triggered discussions on the impact of social media on Albania's youth, with Rama himself calling the app a ""neighborhood thug.""But opposition parties have argued against the ban, saying that they rely on the app for campaigning. The next parliamentary elections will be held in May, bringing the timing of the ban into question.Albania will be the first European nation to block the app entirely. But other countries may soon follow suit.Romanian authorities have called for the app to be suspended amid the ongoing chaos of their recently voided election. Experts credit the app for assisting a far-right candidate's shock win in last year's vote, before the result was annulled by a court.Other countries have already taken further steps.In 2020, India banned TikTok citing national security concerns.Last year, Australia banned access to all social media, including TikTok, for children under 16 years old.France, meanwhile, temporarily banned the app in New Caledonia, one of its remaining overseas colonies.","TikTok will be blocked in Albania for one year, starting Thursday.

Iran WARNS Trump’s Attack On Khamenei Would Trigger JIHAD, Top General Says ‘Will Chop Off...’





United States President Donald Trump on Tuesday said America would wipe out Iran if the Islamic nation assassinates him.""I have very firm instructions — anything happens, they're going to wipe them off the face of this earth,"" Trump said in an interview on NewsNation's “Katie Pavlich Tonight”.Trump's remark came hours after Iran warned him not to take any action against the country's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.Earlier, the US president had called for an end to Khamenei's nearly 40-year reign.""Trump knows that if any hand of aggression is extended toward our leader, we not only cut that hand but also we will set fire to their world,"" General Abolfazl Shekarchi, a spokesperson for Iran's armed forces, said, according to news agency AP.Earlier, in a weekend interview, Trump described Khamenei as a “sick man” and openly called for regime change. “It’s time to look for new leadership in Iran,” Trump told Politico, urging the leadership to “stop killing people.”Tensions between Washington and Tehran have been high since nationwide protests broke out on December 28, driven by Iran’s deepening economic crisis. The demonstrations were met with a harsh crackdown by authorities.Trump has said the United States has drawn two red lines: the killing of peaceful protesters and the risk of mass executions in the aftermath of the unrest.A government-imposed internet blackout since January 8 has made it difficult to verify the true scale of the violence. However, the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) said on Tuesday that at least 4,519 people have been killed.On Saturday, Khamenei acknowledged the bloodshed for the first time, saying “several thousand” had died, though he blamed the violence on US interference. His remarks marked the first public admission by Iran’s leadership of the scale of the casualties.Meanwhile, national police chief Gen Ahmad Reza Radan announced a three-day window for what he described as “deceived” youth to surrender, promising leniency for those who turn themselves in for their role in the unrest.","U.S. President Donald Trump said America would wipe out Iran if the Islamic nation assassinates him.

US President Donald Trump ’s designated aircraft, Air Force One, made a sharp U-turn and returned to Joint Base Andrews on Tuesday after the crew reported a “minor electrical issue” during his trip to Davos for the World Economic Forum A US government motorcade was seen heading toward the Maryland base on Tuesday night (local time).White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the decision to turn back was taken shortly after takeoff, after the Air Force One crew detected a “minor electrical issue” and chose to return as a precaution.A reporter on board the aircraft said the lights in the press cabin briefly went out after takeoff, though no explanation was provided at the time.The White House Rapid Response team also confirmed on social media that the issue had been identified mid-flight.“Out of an abundance of caution, AF1 is returning to Joint Base Andrews. The President and team will board a different aircraft and continue on to Switzerland,” the post said.The two planes has been serving as presidential vehicle -- Air Force One in service for nearly four decades. Boeing has been developing replacements, but the program has hit by multiple delays.Last year, Qatar's ruling family gifted Trump a luxury Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet to join the Air Force One fleet, a move that drew major scrutiny.The plane is currently being retrofitted to meet security requirements.Leavitt joked to reporters on Air Force One Tuesday night that the Qatari jet was ""sounding much better"" at the moment.The aircraft was expected to land at Joint Base Andrews around 11 pm (local time).Trump was scheduled to meet several global leaders in Davos and had earlier described the Switzerland visit as an “interesting trip.” “I have no idea what’s going to happen, but you are well represented,” he said before departure.Last February, an Air Force aircraft carrying secretary of state Marco Rubio to Germany was forced to return to Washington after a mechanical problem.In October, a military plane transporting defence secretary Pete Hegseth made an emergency landing in the United Kingdom due to a cracked windshield.","US President Donald Trump's designated aircraft, Air Force One, made a sharp U-turn and returned to Joint Base Andrews on Tuesday.

Trump WARNS Of US Attack On Khamenei Regime Amid Protests | 'America Will Rescue If Iran Shoots...'





Iran’s military issued a chilling warnung to Washington on Wednesday, vowing to ""set fire to their world"" if any action is taken against Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei.“Trump knows that if any hand of aggression is extended toward our leader, we not only cut that hand but also we will set fire to their world,” warned Gen Abolfazl Shekarchi, a spokesman for Iran’s armed forces.The rhetoric follows a weekend interview in which President Trump described Khamenei as a “sick man” and explicitly called for regime change. “It’s time to look for new leadership in Iran,” Trump told Politico, urging the leader to “stop killing people.”Relations between Washington and Tehran have been strained since protests erupted across Iran on December 28, triggered by the country’s worsening economic conditions.

Macron EXPLODES At Trump’s ‘UNWANTED & CRAZY’ Greenland Threats After Leaked Chats | Watch





French President Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday hit back at his American counterpart Donald Trump after the latter shared a screenshot of their private conversation on social media, saying he “stands by his words” and that Europe would not yield to bullies or be intimidated, referring to Trump's constant demand to absorb Greenland in the US.Responding to questions about the leak, Macron said he took full responsibility for his actions and remarks. “I take responsibility for everything I do. I tend to be consistent in what I say in public and in what I do in private,” he said.Asked whether he would meet Trump on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Macron ruled it out, explaining that he would have left by the time the US president arrived.Macron also dismissed reports of a G7 summit being scheduled this week. “No meeting is scheduled. The French presidency is willing to hold one,” he told news agency AFP in Switzerland's Davos.While other European leaders struck a cautious tone to avoid escalating the transatlantic rift, French President Emmanuel Macron took a far more confrontational stand.Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Macron said France and Europe would not “passively accept the law of the strongest,” warning that doing so would amount to “vassalisation.” He stressed that Europe would continue to defend territorial sovereignty and the rule of law, even as the world, in his words, shifts toward “a rules-free order.” This, he said, could include the European Union responding with tough trade sanctions of its own.“We prefer respect to bullies,” Macron said. “And we prefer the rule of law to brutality.”Macron’s remarks came after US President Trump threatened steep tariffs on French wine and champagne and posted private messages exchanged with the French leader -- an unusual breach of diplomatic protocol.A day earlier, Trump had shared details of a private conversation with Macron on Truth Social, launched a sharp personal attack saying the French president “will be out of office soon,” and after being told that Macron was unwilling to join his proposed “board of peace.”","French President Emmanuel Macron hit back at his American counterpart Donald Trump after the latter shared a screenshot of their private conversation on social media.

‘He’s a T-rex’: Global leaders react to Trump’s Greenland threats,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/hes-a-t-rex-global-leaders-react-to-trumps-greenland-threats-watch/articleshow/126912261.cms,"Putin SHOCKS Trump On Greenland, Iran & Venezuela Oil; Russia Goes All-Out Against US: 'NO INTEREST'





Warnings of a return to colonial-era power politics – and unusually blunt language – dominated discussions at the World Economic Forum on Tuesday as global leaders reacted to US President Donald Trump’s renewed push to seize Greenland and impose related trade tariffs, according to the AP.The annual gathering comes amid heightened tensions over global trade and security, with Trump’s stance on Greenland unsettling European allies and middle powers alike. While the US president is not scheduled to address the forum until Wednesday, his policies loomed large over debates in Davos.French president Emmanuel Macron cautioned against what he described as a dangerous shift in global order. Warning of “a new colonial approach,” Macron said such moves risked undermining decades of international cooperation.“It’s a shift towards a world without rules. Where international law is trampled underfoot and where the only law that seems to matter is that of the strongest, and imperial ambitions are resurfacing,” he said.Macron also criticised US trade practices, denouncing “competition from the United States of America, through trade agreements that undermine our export interests… combined with an endless accumulation of new tariffs that are fundamentally unacceptable.”The strongest language, however, came from California governor Gavin Newsom, who addressed European leaders in the forum’s entrance hall.“I can’t take this complicity. People rolling over. I should’ve brought a bunch of knee pads for all the world leaders,” Newsom said.“I hope people understand how pathetic they look on the world stage… from an American perspective, it’s embarrassing.”Referring directly to Trump, Newsom added, “Diplomacy with Donald Trump? He’s a T-Rex. You mate with him or he devours you. One or the other… Wake up! Where the hell has everybody been? Stop with this (expletive) diplomacy sort of niceties… Have some spine, some goddamn (expletive).”Canadian prime minister Mark Carney urged countries outside the top tier of global power to deepen cooperation rather than compete for favour.“Great powers can afford for now to go it alone. They have the market size, the military capacity, and the leverage to dictate terms. Middle powers do not,” he said. “In a world of great power rivalry… if we’re not at the table, we’re on the menu.”Carney also rejected US ambitions in the Arctic, saying, “We stand firmly with Greenland and Denmark and fully support their unique right to determine Greenland’s future.”With Trump absent, US treasury secretary Scott Bessent sought to calm tensions, playing down the rift with Europe. “I think our relations have never been closer,” Bessent said. “Calm down the hysteria. Take a deep breath.”He added that while disagreements existed over Greenland, “Europe is an ally, the US-NATO membership is unquestioned.”Belgian prime minister Bart De Wever warned that Trump’s rhetoric had crossed multiple red lines in Europe. “Being a happy vassal is one thing. Being a miserable slave is something else,” he said, cautioning that backing down now would mean “you’re going to lose your dignity.”European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said escalating trade disputes risked weakening the West. “The proposed additional tariffs are a mistake, especially between long-standing allies,” she said, adding: “In politics, as in business, a deal is a deal.”If US policy shifts proved permanent, she said, “then Europe must change permanently too,” calling for a more independent Europe while stressing that a diplomatic “downward spiral” would only embolden adversaries.The renewed push for Greenland by Trump and approach to trade, and alliances has created a growing unease among US allies as once again tests the post-war transatlantic order.(With inputs from agency)","French president Emmanuel Macron warns of a dangerous shift in global order.

— Mel (@Villgecrazylady) January 18, 2026 A casual lunch turned into a frightening ordeal for five software engineers in Minneapolis last week after they were mistakenly labelled as federal immigration agents and confronted by an angry crowd outside the restaurant where they were dining. The incident, which took place at Clancy’s Deli near 38th Street and Grand Avenue South, highlights the heightened tensions over Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity in the Twin Cities as protests and community unrest escalate.According to accounts obtained by Alpha News, the group of software engineers, all white males dressed casually, were quietly eating lunch when one of the men received a message on an anti-ICE Signal chat group claiming that plainclothes ICE agents were inside the restaurant.

In this climate, misinformation and real-time alerts from activist networks can spark rapid, sometimes volatile public responses, as seen in the Clancy’s Deli episode. Anti-ICE protester groups have been mobilising quickly via encrypted messaging apps to track and confront perceived federal agents but incidents like this highlight the risk of misidentification and escalation when tensions run high.

The software engineers involved described mixed political views within their group, with some identifying as anti-ICE and others as neutral or supportive of immigration enforcement, underscoring the unpredictable consequences of such confrontations. Lee said the incident has forced some in the group to rethink their positions amid the volatile local climate.

What comes next

As Minneapolis grapples with ongoing protests, federal enforcement actions and community divisions, this episode serves as a stark reminder of how quickly everyday situations can spiral into dangerous confrontations. Local authorities have been balancing enforcement with public safety protocols, including a recent federal court ruling limiting the arrest powers of DHS agents against peaceful protesters, underscoring both legal and social complexities in the region.

What began as a quiet lunch for a group of tech workers has become another headline in a city struggling with deep divisions over immigration policies, law enforcement presence and citizen activism. Whether viewed as a cautionary tale about misinformation or a symptom of escalating public distrust in federal agencies, the incident has captured public attention and sparked debate over protest tactics, civil liberties and community safety.





The incident is not isolated; it comes amid a broader wave of anti-ICE activism and backlash in Minneapolis triggered by increased federal immigration enforcement. Earlier this month, the fatal shooting of Renee Good by an ICE agent during an enforcement operation drew national attention, intensifying community anger and protest activity throughout the city.Social media reaction to the incident was swift and sharply divided, with the story igniting fierce debate across X (formerly Twitter), Reddit and conservative and progressive forums alike. Critics of the protesters described the confrontation as a chilling example of “mob justice”, warning that viral Signal alerts and online callouts are increasingly putting ordinary civilians at risk based on assumptions alone.Many users expressed alarm at how quickly a false accusation escalated into public harassment, with some calling it a failure of crowd restraint and accountability in activist spaces. On the other side, some anti-ICE voices argued that heightened vigilance was a byproduct of aggressive immigration enforcement and mistrust of authorities, though even among them, several conceded that misidentification and intimidation crossed a line.While one X user commented, ""Five random White guys eating lunch in Minnesota get reported as “undercover ICE agents” to an anti-ICE Signal chat by the restaurant’s owner and the next thing they know a mob has showed up to accost them. And because Minneapolis has a “no cooperation with ICE policy” the local police are avoiding situations like this altogether- leaving regular citizens to fend for themselves and deal with these psychotic gangs of social justice warriors (sic)"", another wrote, ""It is a Maoist cultural revolution. Citizens forced into struggle sessions by the Democratic Red Guard (sic)"" and yet another tweeted, ""“…the encounter left some of them reconsidering their positions.” I would certainly hope so. If not, I don’t know what it would take (sic).""The episode has since become a flashpoint in the broader online debate over protest culture, misinformation, and whether social media–fuelled rapid-response activism is eroding basic norms of due process and personal safety.Minneapolis has become a flashpoint in the nationwide debate over immigration enforcement. Federal operations known as Operation Metro Surge have deployed thousands of immigration agents in the region, resulting in widespread protests, legal battles, and public safety concerns. The broader atmosphere has become fraught, with immigrant communities and local residents voicing strong opposition to ICE tactics and federal intervention.","Five software engineers were mistakenly labelled as federal immigration agents and confronted by an angry crowd outside the restaurant where they were dining.

NATO Surrenders Before Trump? ‘Only 34 Troops To Defend Greenland From US…’ | Shock Announcement





US President Donald Trump has written a blunt letter to Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre, linking the Nobel Committee’s decision not to award him the Nobel Peace Prize to his hardened stance on Greenland, saying he no longer feels bound to “think purely of Peace”.According to a copy of the letter obtained by Bloomberg, Trump’s message to the Norwegian leader — first reported by a PBS journalist on X — was circulated by the US National Security Council (NSC) to several other European governments, underscoring Washington’s intent to make the communication widely known.“Dear Jonas: Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America. Denmark cannot protect that land from Russia or China, and why do they have a “right of ownership” anyway? There are no written documents, it’s only that a boat landed there hundreds of years ago, but we had boats landing there, also. I have done more for NATO than any other person since its founding, and now, NATO should do something for the United States. The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland.Thank you! President DJT,” Trump wrote according to Bloomberg.Reacting to the letter, Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre said Trump’s message was sent in response to a brief text message he had earlier conveyed to the US President.“Trump’s message came in response to a short text message to President Trump from me earlier in the day, on behalf of myself and the President of Finland, Alexander Stubb,” Støre said.Støre underlined that Trump had been repeatedly informed that the Nobel Peace Prize decision does not rest with the Norwegian government.“I have repeatedly clearly explained to Trump that it is an independent committee that awards the Nobel Peace Prize,” he said.Norway had expressed disbelief last week after Nobel Peace Prize laureate María Corina Machado handed her medal to US President Donald Trump, who has long coveted the award. Trump, who has repeatedly claimed he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize for resolving multiple conflicts during his second term, accepted the medal during a meeting with the Venezuelan opposition leader at the White House.The move prompted a swift clarification from the Norwegian Nobel Committee.“The Nobel Prize and the laureate are inseparable,” the committee said in a statement on Friday. “Even if the medal or diploma later comes into someone else’s possession, this does not alter who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.”Trump’s letter to Norway PM follows a series of public statements in which he has accused Denmark of failing to counter what he describes as a Russian security threat in the Arctic.Earlier on Sunday, Trump said Denmark had not been able to do anything to remove the “Russian threat” from Greenland and added, “Now it is time, and it will be done!!!”“NATO has been telling Denmark, for 20 years, that ‘you have to get Russian threat away from Greenland.’ Unfortunately, Denmark has been unable to do anything about it,” Trump wrote in a post on his social media platform, Truth Social.Trump has repeatedly said he will settle for nothing less than ownership of Greenland, an autonomous territory that remains part of the Kingdom of Denmark.Leaders in both Denmark and Greenland have firmly rejected Trump’s position, insisting the island is not for sale and that Greenlanders do not wish to become part of the United States.The pressure campaign has also taken on an economic dimension. On Saturday, Trump vowed to impose a wave of escalating tariffs on European allies until the United States is allowed to buy Greenland.","US President Donald Trump has written a blunt letter to Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre.

Putin’s Powerful 145-drone Swarm Knocks Out Five Ukrainian Regions; Zelensky ‘Complains’ To Trump





Parts of Russia’s Far Eastern Kamchatka Peninsula are reeling under extreme and record-breaking snowfall, with powerful winter storms dumping several metres of snow and bringing daily life to a near standstill.Footage has emerged showing heavy snowfall in Russia that lasted for four days without interruption, blanketing residential areas, roads and buildings.In Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, the capital of Kamchatka Krai, road conditions remain “critical” after a series of storms battered the region with snow, ice and strong winds, reported The Moscow Times.Meteorologists said the level of snowfall recorded since early January has not been seen in more than 50 years. As per The Moscow Times, the average snow height in the city has reached around 170 cm, with drifts exceeding 2.5 metres in some neighbourhoods.In some areas, drifts have risen several metres high, blocking building entrances and burying cars almost completely.People were seen digging out their cars after a powerful snowstorm dumped several feet of snow across parts of Russia’s Kamchatka Peninsula, as visuals showed locals carving paths through towering snowbanks.Russian children were also seen enjoying the unusual conditions, sliding on snow piled up near multistorey buildings, while residents in some areas had fun snow-gliding and diving into massive drifts.The current record-breaking snowfall in Russia’s Kamchatka Peninsula has seen drifts reach up to five metres (16 feet).City authorities declared a state of emergency after at least two elderly men were killed by snow falling from rooftops last week, as per The Moscow Times.Officials warned that icicles and heavy snow accumulation on roofs continue to pose serious risks, while prolonged snowfall has also raised avalanche concerns in residential areas.According to Reuters, Kamchatka has witnessed its heaviest snowfall in around 60 years, disrupting transport and forcing residents to adapt to extraordinary conditions.Life in the region remains severely affected as authorities race to clear roads and restore normal movement.","Parts of Russia’s Far Eastern Kamchatka Peninsula are reeling under extreme and record-breaking snowfall.

A Danish member of the European parliament delivered an unorthodox and profane rebuke to US President Donald Trump on Tuesday (local time), saying “Let me put this in words you might understand: Mr President. ..” during a session addressing Trump’s controversial outreach on Greenland’s future.Anders Vistisen, a Danish member of the European parliament, was immediately interrupted by the parliament vice president Nicolae Stefanuta, who reminded him that such language was prohibited in the chamber.“I’m sorry, colleague… we have clear rules about cuss words, language that is inappropriate in this room. I’m sorry to interrupt you but it is unacceptable, even if you might feel strongly about it,” the presiding chair said.The outburst came amid renewed tensions over Trump’s continued push to bring Greenland under American control in a bid to bolster what he says is a national and global security necessity.It comes as Trump recently shared a post tied to Greenland, including an altered image on his social media platform Truth Social showing a map of North America marked with the American flag over Greenland, Canada and Venezuela to depict expanded US territory.Another edited image depicted Trump, US state and war secretary planting a US flag in Greenland, labelled “US Territory Est 2026.”Vistisen, who represents the Danish People’s Party in the European Parliament, has previously addressed Trump on the subject.In a 2025 address, he stressed Greenland’s long historical ties to Denmark, noting that the island had been part of the Danish kingdom for some 800 years and saying “it is not for sale.” He followed that declaration with the same profanity-laden remark directed at Trump.Tuesday’s session focused on broader concerns about Greenland’s sovereignty and strategic positioning in global geopolitics, with Trump’s overtures drawing scrutiny from European lawmakers who view the Arctic territory’s status as non-negotiable.The Danish lawmaker’s comment reflects growing frustration among European representatives over Trump’s public pressure on the issue. Trump has asserted that Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory of strategic importance in the Arctic, is critical to US national security and has even floated the idea of potential US acquisition, measures that have drawn sharp criticism from Denmark and its allies.","Anders Vistisen, a Danish member of the European parliament, was immediately interrupted by the parliament vice president Nicolae Stefanuta.

LIVE: Canadian PM Mark Carney Special Address at Davos WEF 2026





Canadian prime minister Mark Carney on Tuesday said the rules-based order, a concept that took shape after World War II, has been ""partially false"" and a ""fiction"" as the strongest country would ""exempt themselves when convenient"".Stripping off the charade of the rules-based order, Carney said: ""International law (was) applied with varying rigour depending on the identity of the accused or the victim.""""We knew the story of the international rules-based order was partially false — that the strongest would exempt themselves when convenient, that trade rules were enforced asymmetrically, and that international law applied with varying rigour depending on the identity of the accused or the victim,"" Carney said in a strong-worded address at World Economic Forum in Davos.In a major confession from a Western leader against the unbridled and unchecked American hegemony, the Canadian PM said the Western nations ""avoided calling out the gaps between rhetoric and reality"" as the American hegemony helped provide public goods.Calling claimed ""neutrality"" and equal rule-application within that order a fiction, Carney said:""It was useful, and American hegemony, in particular, helped provide public goods: open sea lanes, a stable financial system, collective security, and support for frameworks for resolving disputes.""He further said: ""So we placed the sign in the window. We participated in the rituals. And we largely avoided calling out the gaps between rhetoric and reality. This bargain no longer works.Let me be direct. We are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition.""Carney, without naming US president Donald Trump , who have been hostile towards Canada ever before assuming office a year ago, tore into the Republican leader, saying: ""You cannot live within the lie of mutual benefit through integration when integration becomes the source of your subordination.""""Over the past two decades a series of crises in finance, health, energy, and geopolitics have laid bare the risks of extreme global integration. But more recently, great powers have begun using economic integration as a weapon. Tariffs are leverage, financial infrastructure is coercion, and supply chains have vulnerabilities to be exploited,"" the Canadian PM said.Carney’s remarks come against the backdrop of renewed disruption caused by Donald Trump’s foreign-policy posture, particularly his fixation on Greenland. Trump’s revived demand for greater US control over Greenland has unsettled Nato allies and deepened anxiety in Europe, where the move is seen as undermining sovereignty and alliance norms.The issue has sharpened tensions between Washington and European capitals, reinforcing concerns that power, rather than rules, increasingly defines Western decision-making.Carney’s comments also reflect Canada’s direct exposure to Trump's coercive tactics. Ottawa has faced repeated tariff threats, trade pressure, and inflammatory rhetoric, including Trump’s past suggestion that Canada could become a US state.Similar pressure has been applied to allies such as France, particularly through trade and defence disputes. In this context, Carney’s critique frames economic integration not as mutual benefit but as leverage, arguing that the old bargain of silence in return for stability has collapsed under a more transactional and confrontational American approach.","Canadian PM Mark Carney said the rules-based order, a concept that took shape after World War II, has been ""partially false"" and a ""fiction"" as the strongest country would ""exempt themselves when convenient"" In a major confession from a Western leader against the unbridled and unchecked American hegemony, the Canadian PM said Western nations ""avoided calling out the gaps between rhetoric and reality""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126916463,imgsize-245882,width-400,resizemode-4/switzerland-davos.jpg"

Vice President JD Vance and second lady Usha Vance announced Tuesday, January 20, that they are expecting their fourth child, a baby boy, sharing the news in an Instagram post that said both mother and child are healthy.The announcement, made by the vice president and his wife on social media, said the baby is due in late July. JD and Usha Vance are already parents to three children, Ewan, 8, Vivek, 5, and Mirabel, 4.“We’re very excited to share the news that Usha is pregnant with our fourth child, a boy. Usha and the baby are doing well, and we are all looking forward to welcoming him in late July,” the Instagram post read.ID@undefinedCaption not available.The couple also acknowledged the support they have received while balancing public office and family life. “During this exciting and hectic time, we are particularly grateful for the military doctors who take excellent care of our family and for the staff members who do so much to ensure that we can serve the country while enjoying a wonderful life with our children,” the post added.At 40, Usha Vance becomes the first vice presidential spouse to be pregnant while her husband is in office.She is also the youngest woman to serve as second lady since Jane Hadley Barkley, the wife of Vice President Alben Barkley, who assumed the role in 1949 during the Truman administration.The pregnancy announcement also puts to rest recent speculation about the state of the couple’s marriage. In late 2025, a wave of tabloid-style headlines surfaced after Usha Vance was photographed without her wedding ring, prompting unfounded rumors about marital trouble.A spokesperson for the second lady later dismissed the claims, saying, “[Usha is] a mother of three young children, who does a lot of dishes, gives lots of baths, and forgets her ring sometimes.”Vance addressed similar rumors himself in a December interview with NBC News, saying he and Usha “kind of get a kick out of it” and stressing that their marriage is “as strong as it's ever been.”JD Vance has repeatedly spoken about the importance of raising children during his political career. Addressing the crowd at the 2025 March for Life, he said, “Let me say very simply: I want more babies in the United States of America.” He added, “I want more happy children in our country, and I want beautiful young men and women who are eager to welcome them into the world and eager to raise them.”","Vice President JD Vance and second lady Usha Vance are expecting their fourth child.

'America is booming’: Trump lists accomplishments as he marks first year of second term — top quotes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/america-is-booming-trump-lists-accomplishments-as-he-marks-first-year-of-second-term-top-quotes/articleshow/126856071.cms,"Here are the top quotes from his address:

“These are our accomplishments,” Trump said while displaying a thick file of documents.

We have a lot of accomplishments. As you know, this is the first anniversary, and it has been an amazing period of time. We have done more than any other administration has done by far.

Biden had the biggest inflation in the history of our country. But we have brought it down to normal numbers.

We created super-high economic growth, and America is booming.

On Tariffs, Trump said, ""I don't know what the Supreme Court is going to do. Tariff is probably less severe than what a license could be. I don't know where there's a case even there, but we've taken in hundreds of billions of dollars, and if we lose that case, it's possible we're going to have to do the best we can in paying it back. I don't know how that's going to be done very easily without hurting a lot of people. But we're waiting for that case anxiously. We have tremendous national security because of tariffs and tremendous income.

Now, I'm loving Venezuela. They've been working with us so well. It's been so nice. An unbelievably nice woman (María Corina Machado) also did a very incredible thing a few days ago... Maybe we can get her involved. I'd love to be able to do that... The oil companies are getting ready to make massive investments there. They have more oil than even Saudi Arabia.

Our country is proud to attack Venezuela and Iran. Their nuclear capability was wiped out... Qasem Soleimani, the father of the roadside bomb, and Al Baghdadi, the father of ISIS, were rebuilding ISIS. We wiped them out. Done a great job.

In 1961, John F. Kennedy stood before the nation and set a moral benchmark for the presidency. “And so, my fellow Americans: ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country. ” It was a line meant to define public service as sacrifice, not enrichment.More than sixty years later, that ideal stands in stark contrast to the presidency of Donald Trump, a presidency that, by multiple independent estimates, has become extraordinarily profitable for the man holding the office. According to figures cited by The New York Times editorial board, Trump has generated at least $1.4 billion since returning to the White House, a sum that has reignited concerns about conflicts of interest, foreign influence, and the merging of presidential authority with private business. The board cautioned that the number is likely conservative, as significant streams of income remain shielded from public disclosure.Since his reelection, the Trump family has earned at least $23 million from overseas licensing deals, according to The New York Times. At the same time, the Trump Organization is actively pursuing more than 20 international projects, including a luxury hotel in Oman, a commercial tower in western India, and a planned golf course near Riyadh.Many of these ventures depend directly on cooperation from foreign governments and have already delivered millions to the Trump family, Reuters reported. In Vietnam, the White House eased proposed tariffs roughly a month after construction began on a $1.5 billion Trump-branded golf resort outside Hanoi, a project that Vietnamese officials fast-tracked despite conflicts with local law.Qatar has also drawn scrutiny. The country provided Trump with a $400 million jet, which he is currently using as Air Force One and intends to keep after leaving office. During a visit to Doha, Trump publicly linked the relationship to U.S. policy, saying, “We are going to protect this country.”Legal settlements have become another lucrative revenue stream. Companies including X, ABC News, Meta, YouTube and Paramount have collectively paid $90.5 million to Trump or Trump-linked entities to resolve lawsuits, according to Reuters and The New York Times.Paramount alone agreed to a $16 million settlement over the editing of a Kamala Harris interview. Weeks later, federal regulators approved Paramount’s $8 billion merger with Skydance, a sequence that has intensified criticism from ethics experts, Reuters reported. Meanwhile, Amazon, owned by Jeff Bezos, agreed to pay $28 million for a documentary centered on Melania Trump, further adding to the family’s post-return earnings.The largest share of Trump’s post-return income appears to come from cryptocurrency. Estimates cited by The New York Times place the Trump family’s crypto earnings at at least $867 million, though the true figure may be far higher. In an interview with the Financial Times, Eric Trump acknowledged that the family’s crypto income likely exceeds publicly reported estimates.Reuters has reported that Trump-affiliated cryptocurrency ventures allow both U.S. and foreign investors to purchase digital assets tied to the Trump family, creating a potential pathway for money to flow directly to the president’s private interests.One disclosed example involved a UAE-backed investment firm announcing plans to invest $2 billion in a Trump-linked company shortly before the administration approved the UAE’s access to advanced US semiconductor chips. Altogether, Trump’s estimated $1.4 billion haul since returning to office amounts to roughly 16,822 times the median U.S. household income, on top of entering office as the wealthiest president in American history.","Donald Trump has earned at least $1.4 billion since returning to the White House, according to The New York Times editorial board.

A petition has been floated to counter President Donald Trump's aggression to grab Greenland, claiming that California should then come to Denmark. The petition is satirical but is gaining support and already collected around 290K signatures.

California could be ours, and we need your help to make it happen,"" the pitch said.This is, however, not a new petition and was first reported in February 2025 as Trump expressed interest in acquiring Greenland for the first time in 2019 and renewed the call soon after taking charge last year.But now that Trump's Greenland ambition has reached a point of no return, the petition has resurfaced.They also detailed why they chose California and sunlight is the first reason as Denmark's weather is damp.Tech bros, avocado toast, protection of the free world, and Disneyland all come after sunlight. They said they would rename Disneyland as 'Hans Christian Andersenland'.""Crowdfunding Goal of $1 trillion (give or take a few billion). That’s just 200,000 kroner from every Dane.

The Swiss-French national said he took help from his Danish friends to give it the final shape. “While on vacation in the Philippines, I was at a bar with some friends, and overheard a rather loud American tourist discussing Donald Trump’s bid to buy Greenland from Denmark. That American didn’t seem to grasp how unhinged and absurd it was for any country’s President, especially in a stable democracy that the USA claims to be, to offer or threaten to take over another sovereign country’s territory.

Netizens react to Trump's post

Trump's social media drama





Trump's obsession with acquiring Greenland as a U.S. territory is well-known to the rest of the world by now. However, one of his recent posts, which visually depicts Greenland and Canada as parts of America has created much frenzy online.On January 20, 2026, the American President shared a new map of America with Greenland and Canada as parts of it, covered in red, white and royal blue. He shared an AI-made mockup of North America's map on his Truth Social account where he can be seen presenting it in front of a few NATO leaders including Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, President of the European Commission Ursula Von Der Leyen, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, and French President Emmanuel Macron.The symbolism of the image visually depicting Canada and Greenland as parts of America has drawn attention, not only from international authorities but also social media users in Canada who are now fearing and resisting an invasion.People on various social media platforms resisted Trump's idea of acquiring Canada as an American territory.""As a Canadian, let me be crystal clear: we didn’t ask for this, we don’t want this and we’re not your imperial side quest, you f****** delusional sack of s***.Now f*** all the way off, sideways, and take your b******* empire fantasy with you,"" wrote one enraged Canadian on X.""Neoimperialism, 2026. - colorised."" added another.""Is he forcing WW3??"" asked another.The American President continues his shenanigans not only in press interviews but also in social media posts. Along with sharing this image, he shared another image of him hoisting the US flag in Greenland with VP JD Vance and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.Adding fuel to his already flaring fire with French President Emmanuel Macron, Trump shared images of what he described as texts from the French President to him. “My friend, we are totally in line on Syria. We can do great things in Iran. I do not understand what you are doing on Greenland,” the message read.All of these acts are intensified efforts to acquire the world's largest island from Denmark. According to Trump, Denmark is incapable of protecting the Arctic island and has insisted that the US must act decisively.France, along with other European nations has staunchly rejected American attempts at Greenland's takeover, something that seems apparent in Macron's texts to Trump. Thus, explaining the hostility the US President seems to have against the French leader.","The American President shared a new map of America with Greenland and Canada as parts of it, covered in red, white and royal blue.

China Jibes 'BULLY' Trump, WOOS US Allies Amid Greenland Tensions; Warns, 'Don't Slide Back Into...'





US President Donald Trump is heading out to Davos on Wednesday for the swish annual economic meet after torching European allies with leaked texts, memes, and incendiary rhetoric. The MAGA supremo has now doubled down on his demand for acquiring Greenland, sowing panic and discord in Europe, bringing the 76-year old Atlantic alliance close to collapse and leading some European leaders to characterise the United States as the new enemy ahead of Russia and China.“As I expressed to everyone, very plainly, Greenland is imperative for national and world security. There can be no going back – — On that, everyone agrees! ” Trump posted on social media on Tuesday ahead of his trip to Davos, revealing that he had a “very good phone call with Mark Rutte, the secretary general of Nato, concerning Greenland, and had agreed to a meeting of the various parties to discuss the matter.It was not clear who agreed with him since there is growing opposition within the US itself to the Greenland grab, except among his most hardcore MAGA supporters. Asked during a chat with reporters what he planned to say to European leaders when they push back on his Greenland plan, Trump said: “I don't think they're gonna push back too much. We have to have it. They have to have this done. They can't protect it. Denmark -- they're wonderful people, but they don't even go there.The MAGA supremo’s take-no-prisoners approach on Greenland came amid speculation among some military analysts that the Pentagon is preparing to deploy 1500 troops from the US Army’s elite 11th Airborne, which specialises in cold weather warfare, not to Minneapolis as publicly stated, but to Greenland. The aggressive push, backed by Trump aides like Stephen Miller, has alarmed European leaders. ""All of my lifetime we've been told the Russians were coming. ..and were about to invade Europe. And as it turns out, it's the Americans that are coming,"" the former British MP George Galloway declared.Trump allied social media accounts also posted memes showing the US president holding forth in the Oval Office with a map showing Canada and Greenland draped in US flag colors and a caption indicating they will become US territories in 2026.Ahead of his trip to Davos, Trump softened up European leaders, disclosing private messages from a supplicating French President Emanuel Macron in which the latter pleaded for meeting. “My friend, we are totally in line on Syria. We can do great things on Iran. I do not understand what you are doing on Greenland. Let us try to build great things,” Macron implored in the text message, a screenshot of which Trump posted online. The French president also offered to set up a G-7 meeting in Paris after Davos and invited Trump to a dinner.Compounding European embarrassment by publicly disclosing Macron’s entreaties, Trump also disdainfully dismissed reports that the French president had declined to join the Board of Peace he (Trump) has proposed, saying, “Nobody wants him… I’ll put a 200% tariff on his wines and he’ll join.” He added: ""Nobody wants him because he'll be out of office very soon.""Pushback to Trump’s tariff-driven expansionism came not so much from a stunned, but still supplicating Europe, but from within the US.“I am incoherent with astonishment. If the Congress will not impeach Trump, the Cabinet must invoke the 25th Amendment,” foreign policy analyst Daniel Pipes said in a post on X after the leaked messages that humiliated European leaders, including Trump’s texts to the Norwegian prime minister complaining about not getting the Nobel Prize. The 25th amendment allows replacement of a US president after death, resignation, removal, or incapacitation. And from Trump’s niece Mary Trump, a psychologist, a political commentator, and a critic of the president: “When I saw this letter, I literally thought, “This is too stupid even for him.” I should have known better.”But the White House was unapologetic, with Trump aide Stephen Miller, taking an increasingly bigger role in foreign policy, going on air to argue that Denmark is not entitled to Greenland because it cannot defend the territory. The reasoning drove one Danish lawmaker apoplectic. “I hope he’s kept away from young women, because that’s the mentality of a rapist. You can’t defend yourself, so I’m going to take you. That’s basically what he’s saying. ’ Danish parliamentarian Rasmus Jarlov said of the “might is right” doctrine.","US President Donald Trump is heading out to Davos on Wednesday for the swish annual economic meet.

Rescue operation ongoing amid structural risks

Dozens feared missing



Compensation announced for victims’ families







The death toll from a devastating fire at a major shopping plaza in Pakistan’s largest city, Karachi, has risen to 26, with authorities warning that the number could climb further as search operations continue, as reported by Geo TV. The blaze tore through Gul Plaza, a multi-storey wholesale and retail market, late on Saturday night, trapping dozens inside.Rescue teams gained fuller access to the building nearly 24 hours later, after firefighters managed to bring the inferno under control. Officials said smoke was still rising from the structure on Monday, complicating efforts to locate missing people.Rescue 1122 Sindh spokesperson Hassan Khan said 21 bodies had been recovered so far, adding that search operations were still under way. “The search will continue,” he said, as concerns remain over possible structural collapses inside the severely damaged building.Mohammed Shah, part of the Pakistan Navy’s rescue team, described the incident as a “deep-seated fire”, noting that smoke continued to emanate from the debris despite the flames being largely extinguished. Firefighters said the blaze had been brought 95 per cent under control, with cooling operations now in progress.Officials warned that the weakened structure posed serious dangers. Portions of the building’s front and back façades have collapsed, while cracks have been detected inside.Sindh chief minister Murad Ali Shah said authorities were still trying to establish the final death toll. Speaking at a press conference, he said around 65 people who were reported to have visited Gul Plaza remain unaccounted for, raising fears that casualties could rise sharply.“I cannot give a final number as of yet,” he said. “There has been a considerable loss of lives in this incident.”South DIG Syed Asad Raza said more areas of the plaza were yet to be cleared, and warned the number of fatalities could increase as debris is removed.The Sindh government has announced Rs10 million (£28,000) in compensation for the family of each person killed. “There can be no price tag on a life,” the chief minister said, adding that the compensation process would begin immediately.He also confirmed that one firefighter was among those who lost their lives.The cause of the fire has not yet been confirmed. Officials initially suspect an electrical short circuit, though a forensic investigation has been ordered. Police said samples had been collected for DNA matching to help identify victims.Authorities revealed that although the plaza had 16 gates, only three exits were open at the time of the fire, raising serious questions over safety compliance.Karachi has witnessed repeated fatal fires, often linked to poor safety standards, illegal construction and inadequate fire prevention systems. A government audit in 2024 found that the vast majority of commercial buildings in the city lacked proper fire safety measures.","Blaze tore through Gul Plaza, a multi-storey wholesale and retail market, late on Saturday night, trapping dozens inside.

Karachi Gul Plaza Fire Claims At Least 10 Lives, Dozens Missing As Rescue Operations Continue





The death toll from a major fire at an old shopping mall in Pakistan’s Karachi has risen to 14 after rescue teams recovered eight more bodies from the debris, officials said on Monday.The blaze broke out late Saturday night at Gul Plaza, a multi-storey wholesale and retail market on MA Jinnah Road in the city’s Saddar area. The fire was brought under control by Sunday night, but rescue operations continued as large parts of the building suffered severe structural damage.Six bodies were found soon after the fire erupted, with officials saying the victims likely died of suffocation. Dozens of injured people were rushed to nearby hospitals. As the fire spread rapidly, thick smoke and intense heat initially prevented rescue teams from entering the building.“Once the fire was doused, we didn’t wait for the cooling period and forcibly went in to rescue trapped people and we found eight more bodies, some badly charred,” Rescue 1122 Chief Operating Officer Abid Jalal told PTI.Jalal said the fire had almost completely damaged the building, with both the front and rear portions collapsing due to weakened pillars.“The structure has become extremely unsafe, and we are still searching as there is a risk of further collapses,” he said.Gul Plaza, built in the early 1980s, houses around 1,200 shops spread across a basement, mezzanine and three upper floors. It has long been a prominent commercial hub in Karachi.Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori, who visited the site on Monday, said authorities feared that dozens of people could still be trapped inside. “We are extremely concerned and alarmed. Efforts are going on to find them but this is a national tragedy,” he told reporters.South Deputy Inspector General of Police Syed Asad Raza said the casualty count could rise as large sections of the building were yet to be searched. Officials suspect an electrical short circuit may have caused the fire, though the exact cause will be confirmed after a full investigation.The incident has once again highlighted serious fire safety concerns in Karachi. In recent years, several commercial buildings in the city have caught fire due to poor safety measures, faulty electrical systems and illegal construction.A government audit in 2024 found that most shopping malls lacked proper fire safety systems, emergency exits and compliant wiring.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari expressed grief over the loss of lives, while the Sindh government has ordered an inquiry into the incident.","The death toll from a major fire at an old shopping mall in Pakistan's Karachi has risen to 14.

Firefighting hampered by smoke, structure damage

Many still trapped





At least six people, including a firefighter, were killed after a massive fire tore through Gul Plaza, a multi-storey shopping mall on Karachi’s busy MA Jinnah Road late on Saturday night. Several others were feared trapped more than 12 hours after the blaze erupted, as rescue operations continued into Sunday.Sindh Inspector General of Police Javed Alam Odho said the fire broke out at around 10.45pm, when most shopkeepers were closing their stores or had already left for the night.Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan said around 20 people had been pulled out of the building and shifted to hospital. He added that the complex layout of the mall was hampering rescue efforts. “Once the cooling starts, we will start further rescue operations, but the layout of the building is very complex as it houses a basement and mezzanine floor with hundreds of shops and stores,” Khan said, as quoted by Dawn.Television footage showed firefighters in protective gear battling intense flames shooting out of windows and balconies, as thick black smoke rose into the night sky and was visible from several blocks away.Dozens of fire engines were deployed, using ladders, water cannons and hoses to reach upper floors.According to officials, the fire spread rapidly after breaking out in an area where shopkeepers had stored imported garments, clothing and plastic household goods, which fuelled the flames. As many as 40 snorkels were pressed into service, and by Sunday afternoon around 60 per cent of the fire had been brought under control.However, the blaze caused severe structural damage. Rescue officials said cracks had appeared in the mall’s walls, while a DawnNewsTV correspondent reported that one side of the building had “completely collapsed”. The News International said poor ventilation and sealed windows had allowed smoke to fill the interior, severely hindering rescue operations.Sindh Labour and Social Protection Minister Saeed Ghani warned that many people could still be inside the building. District South Deputy Commissioner Khoso told Geo News, “There are fears that people are on the first and mezzanine floors. The rescue teams have not been able to reach these floors.”IG Aslam said a short circuit was suspected, though the exact cause would be determined once the fire was fully extinguished. Sindh chief minister Murad Ali Shah has ordered an inquiry, directing Karachi Commissioner Hassan Naqvi to investigate the incident and submit a report.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari expressed grief over the loss of lives, as attention once again turned to poor fire safety standards in Karachi, where deadly mall fires have occurred repeatedly, including one in November 2023 that killed 10 people.","At least six people, including a firefighter, have died after a massive fire tore through Gul Plaza, a multi-storey shopping mall on Karachi’s busy MA Jinnah Road.

Pakistan Calls Indian Army Chief's Terror Camp Remark Delusional Rhetoric, Terror Bosses Blow Cover





At least 23 people were killed in two separate road accidents in Pakistan on Saturday, including six children, as dense fog and over-speeding continued to disrupt traffic across several regions, according to officials.In the first incident, 14 people, including six children and five women, lost their lives when a truck carrying passengers fell from a bridge into a dry canal in Punjab’s Sargodha district.According to news agency PTI, the accident occurred in Kot Momin tehsil, around 200 kilometres from Lahore, during the early hours of the day.A spokesperson for Punjab Emergency Services Rescue 1122 said the truck had 23 people on board, most of them members of an extended family travelling from Islamabad to Faisalabad to attend a funeral.“As the motorway was closed because of heavy fog, the truck took a local route. It fell from the Galapur bridge in Kot Momin tehsil into a dry canal as the driver lost control over the vehicle because of poor visibility,” the spokesperson said.Nine people were injured in the crash and are being treated at the Civil Hospital in Kot Momin, according to PTI.In a separate incident in Balochistan, at least nine people were killed and 15 others injured when a passenger coach overturned on the Makran Coastal Highway near Gwadar early Saturday.Coastal Highway Police Superintendent of Police Aslam Bangulzai confirmed the accident, saying the coach was travelling from Jiwani to Karachi. “The accident took place early this morning on the Makran coastal highway as the passenger coach overturned due to over speeding,” Bangulzai said, as quoted by PTI.Dense fog has severely affected traffic movement across Punjab’s motorways and major roads during night and early morning hours since the onset of an extreme cold wave last month.As reported by Dawn, several motorway sections have been closed intermittently due to low visibility.Pakistan frequently witnesses fatal road accidents, with factors such as over-speeding, poor enforcement of traffic rules, driver fatigue and weak licensing controls cited as major causes.On December 31, at least 14 passengers were killed in a head-on collision between a bus and a van on the Jhang-Faisalabad road in Punjab, according to PTI.","At least 23 people were killed in two separate road accidents in Pakistan on Saturday.

Shaksgam Valley: India bristles over China's fresh claim,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/shaksgam-valley-india-bristles-over-chinas-fresh-claim-dispute-explained/articleshow/126529230.cms,"Why China Building Roads In Shaksgam Valley Is A Direct Strategic Challenge For India In Kashmir

What is the Shaksgam Valley?

What is the dispute about?

Why does Shaksgam Valley matter strategically?

Proximity to Siachen and Ladakh



The valley lies close to the Siachen Glacier, where Indian and Pakistani troops have been locked in a military standoff for decades. Chinese activity in the area adds a third actor to an already volatile theatre. China-Pakistan strategic depth



The region provides China and Pakistan with contiguous territorial access, enabling coordination between Xinjiang and Gilgit-Baltistan. This was impossible before the 1963 agreement. Military and logistics implications



Infrastructure in the Shaksgam Valley improves China’s ability to move troops, equipment and supplies near India’s northern frontiers, particularly Ladakh. Precedent for territorial claims



For India, accepting Chinese control over Shaksgam would weaken its legal position on PoK as a whole and dilute the 1994 parliamentary resolution asserting that the entire region belongs to India.

What has MEA said?

What China said?

What is the China-Pakistan boundary agreement of 1963?

Why does India call the 1963 agreement illegal?

Pakistan is an occupying power: New Delhi holds that Pakistan’s control over parts of Jammu and Kashmir is illegal, making any territorial transfer invalid.

Violation of India’s sovereignty: Any alteration of borders in Jammu and Kashmir without India’s consent infringes upon its territorial integrity.

Dangerous precedent: Accepting the agreement would legitimise third-party involvement in the Kashmir dispute. This legal position has remained unchanged across governments and decades.

What is CPEC and how does it link to Shaksgam Valley?

Why is China pushing infrastructure in this area now?

Securing Xinjiang’s western approache

Protecting CPEC assets amid militant threats in Pakistan

Signalling resolve after standoffs in eastern Ladakh

Reinforce claims through physical presence

Infrastructure, in this sense, becomes both a logistical asset and a political statement.

Where does Pakistan stand?

What happens next?





NEW DELHI: China’s fresh assertion that the Shaksgam Valley “belongs to China” has reopened a largely forgotten but strategically explosive fault line in the long-running Kashmir dispute. Beijing’s defence of infrastructure construction in the region -- tied closely to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) -- has drawn a sharp response from New Delhi, which has once again described the area as an “integral and inalienable part of India”.The disagreement is not merely semantic. At stake are territorial sovereignty, India’s claims over Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), China’s growing footprint in the western Himalayas, and the future shape of regional connectivity linking Xinjiang, Gilgit-Baltistan and the Arabian Sea.This explainer breaks down what the Shaksgam Valley is, why it matters, the legal roots of the dispute, what India and China have said, and how CPEC and the 1963 China-Pakistan boundary agreement fit into the larger geopolitical picture.The Shaksgam Valley -- also known as the Trans-Karakoram Tract -- is a sparsely populated, high-altitude region located north of the Siachen Glacier . It borders China’s Xinjiang province to the north, Pakistan-occupied Gilgit-Baltistan to the south and west, and the Siachen area to the east.Geographically inhospitable, the region is marked by glaciers, mountain passes and extreme weather. Politically, however, it is one of the most sensitive pieces of territory in the Kashmir puzzle.India maintains that the Shaksgam Valley is part of the former princely state of Jammu and Kashmir and therefore legally belongs to India. Pakistan , which has occupied parts of Jammu and Kashmir since 1947, transferred control of the area to China in 1963 — a move New Delhi has never recognised.China currently administers the territory as part of Xinjiang and treats it as sovereign Chinese land.At its core, the dispute revolves around who has the legal authority to decide the fate of the Shaksgam Valley.India’s position is straightforward: Pakistan had no legal right to cede any part of Jammu and Kashmir to a third country because it is an occupying power in PoK. Any agreement signed by Pakistan concerning that territory is therefore “illegal and invalid”.China and Pakistan argue otherwise. They say the 1963 China-Pakistan boundary agreement was a sovereign decision between two independent states to demarcate their frontier and bring stability to a previously undefined border.Beijing has now gone a step further by asserting that infrastructure development in the region is “fully justified”, signalling that it considers the issue closed — at least from its perspective.Despite its harsh terrain, the Shaksgam Valley holds outsized strategic importance for four key reasons:India’s response has been unusually firm and consistent. Ministry of external affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal has categorically rejected both China’s claims and Pakistan’s role in facilitating them.“Shaksgam Valley is an Indian territory. We have never recognised the so-called China-Pakistan boundary agreement of 1963,” Jaiswal said during a weekly briefing.He added that India also does not recognise the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, which passes through territory “under forcible and illegal occupation of Pakistan”.Jaiswal underlined that the entire Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh are an integral and inalienable part of India, and said New Delhi has consistently protested attempts to alter the ground reality in the Shaksgam Valley.Importantly, India has also reserved the right to take necessary measures to safeguard its interests, language that signals both diplomatic and strategic options remain open.China’s response has been equally direct.Beijing's foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning rejected India’s objections, stating: “The territory you mentioned belongs to China. It’s fully justified for China to conduct infrastructure construction on its own territory.”She said China and Pakistan had signed a boundary agreement in the 1960s and demarcated their border as an exercise of sovereign rights.On India’s criticism of CPEC, Mao repeated Beijing’s long-standing line that the project is an economic cooperation initiative aimed at development and improving livelihoods.Crucially, she added that the boundary agreement and CPEC do not affect China’s position on the Kashmir issue, which Beijing says should be resolved peacefully in accordance with UN resolutions and bilateral agreements.Signed on March 2, 1963, the China-Pakistan boundary agreement formally transferred 5,180 square kilometres of territory in the Shaksgam Valley from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir to China.At the time, Pakistan described the move as a provisional arrangement, pending the final settlement of the Kashmir dispute. The agreement includes a clause stating that once Kashmir is resolved, the sovereign authority would renegotiate the boundary with China.India rejected the agreement outright, arguing that Pakistan had no locus standi to sign away territory that legally belonged to India.For China and Pakistan, however, the agreement served a vital purpose: it created a shared land border, laying the foundation for their enduring strategic partnership.India’s objections rest on three pillars:The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor is a Beijing's flagship Belt and Road Initiative project valued at around $60 billion. It links China’s Xinjiang region to Pakistan’s Gwadar port through roads, railways, energy projects and industrial zones.Parts of CPEC pass through Gilgit-Baltistan, which is a part of PoK.While Shaksgam Valley is not the most visible segment of CPEC, its integration into Chinese logistics networks strengthens Beijing’s western connectivity and supports Pakistan’s role as China’s gateway to the Arabian Sea.India argues that CPEC directly infringes on its sovereignty, and has repeatedly warned against third-country participation in projects passing through PoK.Several factors appear to be driving Beijing’s assertiveness:Pakistan has backed China’s position, insisting that the 1963 agreement is valid and that CPEC is critical to its economic future.Islamabad recently announced the creation of a Special Protection Unit to safeguard Chinese nationals working on CPEC projects, underscoring how central the corridor has become to Pakistan-China ties.India, however, continues to describe Pakistan’s actions as illegal and accuses Islamabad of trading away territory that does not belong to it.In the short term, the dispute is likely to play out diplomatically, with India continuing to lodge protests and China proceeding with its projects.In the longer term, the Shaksgam Valley could emerge as another pressure point in the already strained India-China relationship, especially if infrastructure development alters the strategic balance near Ladakh and Siachen.For New Delhi, the challenge lies in defending its territorial claims without triggering escalation, while preventing the gradual normalisation of a situation it considers unlawful.The Shaksgam Valley may be remote and uninhabited, but it sits at the crossroads of India-China rivalry, Pakistan’s territorial gambits, and China’s westward expansion.China’s renewed claim and India’s firm rejection show that the issue is far from settled. What was once a quiet footnote to the Kashmir dispute is now re-emerging as a live geopolitical fault line — one that could shape the strategic landscape of the Himalayas for years to come.","The Shaksgam Valley is a sparsely populated, high-altitude region. It borders China’s Xinjiang province to the north, Pakistan-occupied Gilgit-Baltistan to the south and west, and the Siachen area to the east. It is one of the most sensitive pieces of territory in the Kashmir puzzle. At stake are territorial sovereignty, India's claims over Pakistan- occupied Kashmir, and China's growing footprint in the Himalayas.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126529183,imgsize-1792158,width-400,resizemode-4/representative-ai-image.jpg"

Pact To Power Bloc: How Turkish Arms, Saudi Money And Pakistan Nukes May Align In Islamic NATO





Islamic Nato in the making? Turkey is seeking to join a defence alliance between nuclear-armed Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, this can be seen as an effort in direction to reshape security alignments in the Middle East region and beyond, as Bloomberg reported.The pact, initially signed by Pakistan and Saudi Arabia in September, reportedly states that “any aggression” against one member would be treated as an attack on all -- a provision that mirrors Article 5 of Nato, of which Turkey is a member and fields the second-largest military after the US.Talks on Turkey’s entry are said to be at an advanced stage, with a deal appearing likely, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg on condition of anonymity.Bloomberg reported that the expanded alliance reflects growing overlap in the strategic interests of Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan across South Asia, the Middle East and parts of Africa.Turkey also sees the arrangement as a way to strengthen its security and deterrence posture at a time when questions persist over US reliability and President Donald Trump’s commitment to Nato, despite Washington’s close military ties with all three countries.Saudi Arabia would bring financial strength to the grouping, Pakistan its nuclear capability, ballistic missiles and manpower, while Turkey contributes military experience and a rapidly expanding defence industry, said Nihat Ali Ozcan, a strategist with Ankara-based think tank TEPAV.“As the US prioritizes its own interests and that of Israel in the region, changing dynamics and fallout from regional conflicts are prompting countries to develop new mechanisms to identify friends and foes,” Ozcan said.Turkish defence ministry declined to comment on the report. Pakistan’s information ministry did not respond to requests for comment, while Saudi officials were unavailable over the weekend.If Turkey formally joins the pact, it would highlight a new phase in relations with Saudi Arabia, once rivals for leadership of the Sunni Muslim world. After years of strained ties, the two countries are now deepening economic and defence cooperation, including holding their first-ever naval meeting in Ankara this week, according to the Turkish defence ministry.Despite shared concerns over Shiite-majority Iran, Turkey and Saudi Arabia favour engagement with Tehran rather than confrontation. They also back a stable, Sunni-led Syria and support Palestinian statehood.Turkey and Pakistan already enjoy close military ties. Ankara is building corvette warships for Pakistan’s navy, has upgraded Islamabad’s F-16 fighter jets, and shares drone technology with both Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. Bloomberg previously reported that Turkey now wants both countries to join its Kaan fifth-generation fighter jet programme.The trilateral defence discussions come after a ceasefire between India and Pakistan ended a four-day military clash and high tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May. Regional tensions remain high, however, with Pakistan and Afghanistan at odds following clashes and accusations by Islamabad that the Taliban is sheltering hostile militant groups.Turkey and Qatar have mediated talks between the sides, though those efforts have so far failed to produce a breakthrough, Bloomberg reported.","Turkey is seeking to join a defence alliance between nuclear-armed Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.

‘Not 1, Not 1,000’: Jem Chief Masood Azhar Returns With Audio Threat As India Tightens Terror Noose

Def experts: Azhar’s statement sign of post-Sindoor frustration





A new audio recording purportedly featuring Maulana Masood Azhar , the elusive chief of terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), has surfaced on social media, boasting that his organisation now commands ""thousands"" of suicide bombers who are prepared for immediate deployment.The clip has surfaced at a time when Pahalgam attack mastermind and Lashkar-e-Taiba deputy chief Saifullah Kasuri was captured on video claiming that the Pakistani army had invited him to lead the funeral prayers of its soldiers after Operation Sindoor - conducted by India in May last year following the terror attack in J&K. Both clips were posted on Telegram and X by pro-ISI accounts.The messages are being viewed as a desperate propaganda attempt to revitalize a group reeling from devastating losses inflicted by the Indian armed forces during the operation. Kasoori's speech was made from a school with hundreds of children visible in the audience while Azhar too is seemingly addressing a public gathering, sources said.In another video, Kasuri has also welcomed the growing diplomatic and military ties between Pakistan and Bangladesh. The latest recording features a defiant Azhar claiming that the sheer number of his followers would ""cause an uproar in the global media"" if fully revealed.Azhar said new recruits are driven by the obsession of attaining ""martyrdom"".Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) Masood Azhar asserts that these recruits are driven by a fanatical obsession with “martyrdom”, explicitly stating that they do not seek material comforts like cars, motorcycles or foreign visas. “They only ask Allah for one thing: martyrdom,” the UN-designated terrorist claimed, attempting to project a picture of high morale and spiritual conviction among his cadre.However, defence experts suggested this was little more than a “hollow threat” and a sign of severe frustration arising out of Operation Sindoor, a series of precision strikes by India in May 2025 that decimated JeM’s infrastructure and eliminated at least 10 of Azhar’s close relatives and top aides in Bahawalpur.“This audio appears to be a calculated effort to save face after the group’s leadership was ‘torn to pieces’, as recently admitted by other JeM commanders,” said a source. Interestingly, Azhar has not been seen in public since a 2019 blast at his Bahawalpur hideout, leading to persistent rumours about his health and location.This latest audio, while lacking visual proof of his life, indicates that the terror mastermind is still attempting to operate from the shadows, deep within a safe haven in Pakistan. Security agencies are now closely analysing voice samples and metadata of the clip to track its origin and assess the current threat level posed by the group’s surviving sleeper cells, sources said.","New audio recording purportedly featuring Maulana Masood Azhar has surfaced on social media.

Open Letter From Pakistan Backs India As Baloch Leader Signals Diplomatic Break With Islamabad





A fresh surge of enforced disappearances has been reported across Balochistan, Karachi, and adjoining regions, with nine more Baloch citizens allegedly taken away by Pakistsecurity agencies in recent weeks.Human rights defenders stated that these incidents follow a familiar pattern: individuals are arrested without warrants, held in secret locations, and never brought before a court, as reported by The Balochistan Post.According to The Balochistan Post, sources in Mand, Kech district, stated that Abdullah, son of Iqbal, was whisked away and shifted to an unknown facility. In Karachi, 24-year-old student Hamdan, son of Muhammad Ali, was detained by CTD officials in the Golimar area, with no subsequent legal proceedings or public acknowledgement of his custody.On November 2, 2025, three youths, Dawood Baloch, Usman Baloch, and Hakeem Majeed Baloch, were picked up during early-morning raids in Bhatta Colony by teams from Military Intelligence and the CTD. Their whereabouts remain undisclosed.Additional cases include the late-night detention of religious instructor Zubair from Quetta's Lak Pass area on November 20; the abduction of labourer Muhammad Iqbal Marri from outside the Rakhni Sessions Court in Barkhan on December 26; and the raid in Mastung on 11 December in which Frontier Corps and CTD personnel allegedly took 21-year-old herder Saeed Ahmed.Families say none of these detainees have resurfaced. According to another report, 17-year-old student Jamal Murad was apprehended in Gwadar on 2 January by CTD and Military Intelligence operatives, after which he disappeared.The Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP) continued its protest camp outside the Quetta Press Club, marking its 6,052nd day. Families, including the relatives of Nasreena Baloch, reportedly detained during a raid in Hub Chowki, joined the demonstration.Her family stated that local police refused to register an FIR, while the Hub Press Club was locked to stop their press briefing, as highlighted by The Balochistan Post.VBMP Chairman Nasrullah Baloch accused state institutions of weaponising national security to intensify enforced disappearances, even targeting Baloch women. He said detainees are denied legal rights, courts are bypassed, and new laws merely protect extrajudicial actions.He called on national and international bodies to take meaningful steps to end the crisis and secure the release of all missing persons, as reported by The Balochistan Post.","A fresh surge of enforced disappearances has been reported across Balochistan, Karachi, and adjoining regions.

No IMF Loan In 6 Months? Pakistan Defence Minister’s Jet Export Claim Collapses Under Debt Reality





Pakistan on Saturday claimed that Iraq has expressed “keen interest” in acquiring JF-17 Thunder fighter jets and Super Mushshak training aircraft, following talks between the air chiefs of the two countries.According to a statement issued by the Pakistan Army, air chief marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu, chief of air staff of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF), met lieutenant general staff pilot Mohanad Ghalib Mohammed Radi Al-Asadi, commander of the Iraqi Air Force, during an official visit to Iraq.The discussions focused on enhancing bilateral military cooperation, including joint training, capacity building and operational coordination.“The Iraqi air chief praised PAF’s professionalism and technological advancement, expressed interest in benefiting from PAF’s world-class training and expressed keen interest in JF-17 Thunder fighter jets and Super Mushshak trainer aircraft,” the statement said, as quoted by news agency PTI.Both sides also agreed to pursue joint exercises and training initiatives to strengthen interoperability between the two air forces.The JF-17 Thunder is a single-engine, lightweight combat aircraft jointly developed by China’s Chengdu Aircraft Corporation and the Pakistan Aeronautical Complex.Pakistan has claimed that the aircraft proved its capabilities during last year’s conflict with India, although its effectiveness remains disputed.Pakistan had also deployed Chinese-origin J-10 fighter jets during the May 7–10 hostilities with India.The development comes days after Pakistan and Bangladesh air chiefs held talks on the “potential procurement” of JF-17 jets by Dhaka. However, Bangladesh has not officially confirmed any such plan.Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif recently claimed that the country has seen increased interest in its fighter aircraft following the May 2025 standoff with India. Reports have also suggested that Pakistan is exploring similar defence deals with other countries, including Saudi Arabia, amid ongoing financial pressures.Notably, Pakistan has repeatedly relied on International Monetary Fund support in recent years, with the IMF approving a $7 billion bailout in September 2024 and an additional $1.4 billion loan in May 2025.",Iraq has expressed “keen interest’ in acquiring JF-17 Thunder fighter jets and Super Mushshak training aircraft.

Widespread protests erupted in Pakistan’s Sindh province after a young Hindu farmer was killed by a landlord in Badin.According to a report by Pakistan's news outlet the Nation, Kailash Kolhi was shot dead by an influential landlord, Sarfaraz Nizamani, over the construction of a hut on his land.Following Kolhi’s death, demonstrators staged sit-ins on the Badin–Hyderabad National Highway and the Badin–Thar Coal Road. Hundreds of vehicles remained stranded for hours as protesters demanded justice for the killing of Kolhi and vowed not to disperse until those responsible are arrested.According to a statement shared by activist Shiva Kachhi, the protest has been ongoing without pause.“The protest for the arrest of the killers of the martyred Kailash Kolhi is making history. Shiva Kachhi, Chairman of Pakistan Darawar Ittehad, is leading the historic protest sit-in. This was not just a protest—it was the cry of a wounded conscience. From 10:00 am yesterday until late into the night, the sit-in continued without pause, proving that the demand for justice cannot be silenced,” Kachhi said in a social media post on X.“Men, women, elderly people, and innocent children stayed on the streets with one voice and one demand: justice for Kailash Kolhi.Arrest the killers. Despite exhaustion, hunger, and the cold of the night, the determination of the protesters remained unshaken. Kailash Kolhi’s only ‘crime’ was that he was poor, marginalised, and courageous enough to exist in a system that protects the powerful and crushes the weak. The tears of his children, the grief of his mother, and the silent agony of his widow are today questioning the entire system: Is the blood of the poor so cheap?” he added.Earlier, the victim’s family and community members staged a protest by placing the body at Piru Lashari Stop, where the SSP Badin assured them that the accused would be arrested within 24 hours.The incident occurred four days ago in Raho Kolhi village in the Piru Lashari city area. Despite assurances from district police officials, the main accused has yet to be arrested.The ongoing protest has drawn participation from leaders and workers of several political, nationalist, religious, and social organisations, including Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI), Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), Jiye Sindh Mahaz, Qaumi Awami Tehreek, Jeay Sindh Qaumi Mahaz (Bashir Qureshi group), and Awami Tehreek, The Nation reported.","Kailash Kolhi was shot dead by an influential landlord, Sarfaraz Nizamani, over the construction of a hut on his land.

Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif in a controversial statement has urged the United States and Turkey to “kidnap” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu if they believed in justice and humanity, over the Israel-Gaza conflict.In a televised interview, whose clips have now gone viral on social media, Asif said the US should apprehend Netanyahu “just as Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro was taken away.”He added that Turkey could also seize the Israeli leader, and “Pakistanis are praying for it.”Describing Netanyahu as the “worst criminal of humanity,” Asif claimed that “no atrocities in history match those committed against Palestinians in Gaza.” He added, “No community has done what Israel has done to Palestinians in the last 4,000-5,000 years. He [Netanyahu] is the biggest criminal of humanity. The world has not seen a bigger criminal.”Asif also appeared to raise the issue of penalising those he termed as enablers of such crimes, beginning a sentence with, “And what does the law say about those who support such criminals…” before the show’s anchor, Hamid Mir, interjected and called for a break.Mir warned that Asif’s remarks risked being interpreted as a veiled reference to US President Donald Trump, and indicated that Asif would not remain on air after the break.Pakistan does not have formal diplomatic relations with Israel and has historically expressed strong support for the Palestinian cause. Islamabad also maintains close ties with Iran, another regional critic of Israeli policies.The international criminal court (ICC) has previously issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu in connection with alleged war crimes in Gaza, a legal development referenced during the interview.","Khawaja Asif said the US should apprehend Netanyahu “just as Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro was taken away” He added that Turkey could also seize the Israeli leader, and “Pakistanis are praying for it” Asif also appeared to raise the issue of penalising those he termed as enablers of such crimes.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126438854,imgsize-837064,width-400,resizemode-4/khawaja-asif-file.jpg"

With inputs from agency)





Bangladesh’s interim government on Monday said that the majority of incidents involving members of minority communities in the country during 2025 were “criminal in nature” and not driven by communal motives, asserting that only 71 of the 645 cases recorded had communal elements.The statement, issued by the office of chief adviser Muhammad Yunus and later highlighted by him in a post on X, came days after India pressed Dhaka to “swiftly and firmly” deal with attacks on minorities and described as “troubling” attempts to attribute such incidents to extraneous reasons.Citing a year-long review of official police records from January to December 2025, the interim government said 645 incidents involving minority communities were documented nationwide based on verified FIRs, general diaries, charge sheets and investigation updates.“While every incident is a matter of concern, the data presents a clear and evidence-based picture: the overwhelming majority of cases were criminal in nature rather than communal,” the statement said.According to the data, 71 incidents were identified as having communal elements. These included 38 cases of temple vandalism, eight incidents of arson, one case each of theft and murder, and 23 other incidents such as threats to break idols, provocative social media posts and damage to worship pavilions.Police cases were registered in 50 of these incidents, with arrests made in an equal number, while preventive or investigative measures were taken in the remaining cases.The remaining 574 incidents, the government said, were linked to criminal or social disputes unrelated to religion. These included neighbourhood disputes (51), land-related conflicts (23), theft (106), prior personal enmity (26), rape (58) and 172 cases of unnatural death. Police registered 390 cases in this category, filed 154 unnatural death reports and made 498 arrests, with additional measures taken in 30 incidents.The statement stressed that accurate classification was necessary to counter misinformation and enable effective law enforcement.“While all crimes are serious and demand accountability, the data demonstrates that most incidents involving minority victims were not driven by communal hostility, but by broader criminal and social factors that affect citizens across religious and ethnic lines,” it said.However, the Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council (BHBCUC) questioned the government’s assessment.“If the government thinks these are not communal incidents, the question then is whether anyone can take the law into their own hands,” BHBCUC leader Kajal Debnath said, warning that such statements could embolden criminals and create a sense of impunity.India has repeatedly raised concerns over attacks on minorities in Bangladesh, particularly Hindus. On January 9, external affairs ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, “We continue to witness a disturbing pattern of recurring attacks on minorities as well as their homes and businesses by extremists,” adding that such incidents must be dealt with “swiftly and firmly”.Relations between India and Bangladesh have remained strained since the interim government headed by Yunus took charge following the collapse of the Sheikh Hasina government in August 2024, with New Delhi continuing to flag concerns over minority safety.","Bangladesh's interim government says majority of incidents involving members of minority communities in the country during 2025 were “criminal in nature’ The government says only 71 of the 645 cases recorded had communal elements.

DHAKA: Speculation over whether the administration is favouring anti-India voices in parliamentary polls intensified after Election Commission (EC) Saturday cancelled the candidacy of BNP's Monzurul Ahsan Munshi while upholding that of National Citizen Party (NCP) candidate Abul Hasnat for the Cumilla-4 constituency.Hasnat is a frontline leader of the July Uprising that led to the collapse of the Sheikh Hasina-led govt on Aug 5, 2024. He is among a small group of former student leaders widely seen as having contributed to the deterioration of Dhaka-Delhi relations. The decision followed hearings conducted by EC, led by Chief Election Commissioner AMM Nasir Uddin, on appeal petitions filed by both candidates against each other.Bangladesh is scheduled to hold its national elections on Feb 12, which will not see the participation of Sheikh Hasina's party, Bangladesh Awami League, and its allies. If the BNP candidate challenges the EC decision in the high court and the cancellation order is upheld, Hasnat would face no major rival in the constituency, effectively ensuring his victory. Jamaat-e-Islami and NCP are part of an alliance opposing BNP.The EC accepted Hasnat's appeal and cancelled Monzurul Ahsan Munshi's candidature, while rejecting Munshi's appeal and declaring Hasnat's nomination valid for the election.In his petition, Munshi alleged that Hasnat had failed to properly disclose his sources of income in the affidavit submitted with his nomination papers. In response, Hasnat claimed that Munshi is a loan defaulter who had concealed this information in his own nomination documents.",National Citizen Party (NCP) candidate Abul Hasnat for the Cumilla-4 constituency.

The Trump administration has cancelled a contract that provided legal aid to migrant children who enter the country alone.The contract, held by the Acacia Center for Justice , supported around 26,000 children with legal representation and ""know your rights"" clinics. The decision leaves many vulnerable children without essential legal assistance.While Acacia can still provide legal sessions, it will no longer receive government funding for lawyers representing migrant children in court.The contract was set for renewal on March 29, but the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) decided to end nearly all of Acacia’s legal work.Ailin Buigues, who leads Acacia’s unaccompanied children programme, said ""It's extremely concerning because it's leaving these kids without really important support. They're often in a very vulnerable position.""Michael Lukens, director of Amica, one of Acacia’s partner organisations, said they were expecting this move and are now preparing for the worst. ""We're trying to pull every lever but we have to be prepared for the worst, which is children going to court without attorneys all over the country. This is a complete collapse of the system,"" he said.A letter obtained by The Associated Press revealed that the contract was ended ""for the Government's convenience."" The government had already temporarily paused the legal aid programme last month before reinstating it, but this final termination means many children could now face immigration courts alone.","The contract, held by the Acacia Center for Justice, supported around 26,000 children with legal representation and ""know your rights"" clinics.

According to his lawsuit, his seatmate, Jacob Sebbag, grew concerned and alerted the flight crew when Liebb had been inside for about 20 minutes.When a flight attendant knocked, Liebb reportedly assured them he would be out soon. However, 10 minutes later, the pilot allegedly demanded he exit immediately.The lawsuit claims that, in a fit of anger, the pilot broke down the bathroom door and yanked Liebb out while his pants were still down, exposing him to fellow passengers. As he scrambled to pull up his pants, the pilot allegedly threatened to have both him and his seatmate arrested, making a remark about how ""Jews act,"" the lawsuit states.Upon landing, the pair were met by five US customs and border protection agents, who detained them inside the terminal.

Trump Education Department Elimination: Trump signs order to 'eliminate' US education department: What it means for students,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-signs-order-to-eliminate-us-education-department-what-it-means-for-students/articleshow/119283727.cms,"File photo: US President Donald Trump (Picture credit: AP)

Q: What parts of the department of education will remain?

Q: Which students are most at risk from the department’s downsizing?

Q: Is it true that US students are falling behind globally?

Q: What impact has the education department had on student performance?

Q: Is the public in favor of closing the department?

Q: Who supports Trump’s move?

Q: What’s next?

Trump, surrounded by schoolchildren seated at desks arranged in the White House's East Room, smiled as he held up the signed order during a special ceremony.Since its founding in 1979, the department of education (DoE) has played a pivotal role in administering student loans, supporting students with disabilities and low-income families, and enforcing civil rights in schools. Trump’s action, framed as a bid to return power to the states, reflects long-standing conservative frustration with what they view as federal overreach in education.While Trump cannot legally abolish the department without Congressional approval, the executive order signals his administration’s intent to cripple it through staff reductions and budget cuts. Backed by tech tycoon Elon Musk’s department for government efficiency (DOGE), the effort has already seen nearly half of the DoE’s workforce laid off. The move has thrilled conservative groups like Moms for Liberty but sparked outrage among educators, civil rights advocates, and Democratic lawmakers who warn that it could undermine protections and funding for millions of vulnerable students.Here is all you need to knowA: The order directs education secretary Linda McMahon to “take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure of the department of education and return education authority to the states.” While it does not immediately abolish the department—Congress must approve that—it does instruct the administration to scale back operations and staffing.A: Trump argued, “We're going to return education back to the states where it belongs,” calling the federal department unnecessary. He also cited falling test scores and high spending as reasons, saying, “It’s doing us no good.” He believes states can run education systems more efficiently, comparing his goal to countries like “Norway, Denmark, [and] Finland.”A: No. Abolishing a federal agency like the DoE requires an act of Congress. Trump currently lacks the necessary majority to pass such a law. However, he can significantly weaken the department through budget cuts, workforce reductions, and administrative changes.According to White House press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, “The department of education will be much smaller than it is today.” Some “critical functions”—like Pell Grants, student loans, and funding for students with disabilities—are expected to remain. Trump himself said these “useful functions… will be fully preserved.”A: Low-income students, students with disabilities, and students in rural or underfunded districts stand to lose the most. Programs like Title I and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act depend on federal oversight and funding. As Katie Paris of Red Wine and Blue said, “There’s a real opportunity people are going to learn how essential the education department is to access public schools if it’s gone.”A: About 13% of funding for K-12 schools comes from the federal government; the rest is state and locally funded. But that 13% is vital, especially in states that rely heavily on federal dollars—like Mississippi, South Dakota, Montana, and Arkansas.A: Not entirely. Trump claims US students rank “at the bottom of the list,” but data shows otherwise. According to the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), US students are “above average in reading and close to average in math.” Nat Malkus of the conservative American Enterprise Institute added, “The US ranks in the middle of the pack on most international assessments.”A: The department’s critics claim it hasn’t closed achievement gaps. But national data shows that since its founding, fourth-grade math scores have increased by 24 points, and reading scores have held steady. Fernando Reimers of Harvard noted, “In the US only 4 percent of total federal spending is devoted to education,” far less than in many peer countries.A: No. A Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 65% of Americans oppose shuttering the department, with only 30% in support. Democratic pollster John Anzalone argued, “Education is generally popular with voters,” suggesting this could backfire on Trump politically.A: Conservative advocacy groups like Moms for Liberty and the Heritage Foundation strongly back the decision. “It’s a beautiful day to dismantle the Department of Education,” the Heritage Foundation said on X. Moms for Liberty co-founder Tina Descovich added, “I'm very happy about that,” in reference to department cuts.A: Several lawsuits have already been filed. Senator Patty Murray said, “Donald Trump knows perfectly well he can’t abolish the department of education without Congress.” A previous attempt to dismantle the US Agency for International Development was blocked by a federal judge for likely violating the Constitution.While the executive order sets the process in motion, full closure of the department will face Congressional scrutiny, potential legal battles, and continued public debate. As Margaret Spellings, George W Bush’s education secretary, put it: “Donald Trump has called the bluff.” Whether that bluff results in full elimination remains to be seen.(With inputs from agencies)","US President Donald Trump signed an executive order to shut down the department of education.

Becoming a Commonwealth member does not mean accepting the King as head of state

President Donald Trump reacted to The Sun's report that King Charles would make a ""secret offer"" to the president when he visits the UK, for which Prime Minister Keir Starmer had already invited Trump. ""I love King Charles. Sounds good to me,"" Trump reacted on Truth Social triggering a volley of speculations about the secret offer, though The Sun hinted that it would be something to reduce tensions between the White House and Canada.The report said plans are afoot to make the US the next ""associate member"" of the Commonwealth -- a voluntary association of 56 nations, mostly British colonies. Canada is also part of the Commonwealth and as King Charles is one head of state of Canada, it will be his reconciliation plan, the report said.DailyMail quoted a member of the Royal Commonwealth Society who said that the possibility of America making an entry into the Commonwealth is being discussed at the highest levels and is being seen as a wonderful move that would symbolize Britain's close relationship with the US.""Donald Trump loves Britain and has great respect for the Royal Family, so we believe he would see the benefits of this,"" the member said.The US has never been a part of the Commonwealth and the Royal Family thinks including it in the grouping would soothe the tension between Washington and Ottawa. Canada's new prime minister Mark Carney met King Charles this week amid the ongoing US-Canada tariff war.Though the Commonwealth comprises historically British colonies, the grouping aims to work for democracy, human rights, on cultural and economic ties. The most four countries that joined the Common wealth -- Mozambique, Rwanda, Togo and Gabon -- do not have any association with the Crown.

Trump signs order to shut down education dept,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-signs-order-to-shut-down-education-dept/articleshow/119317458.cms,"US president Donald Trump

WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump on Thursday instructed education secretary Linda McMahon to begin shutting down her agency, a task that cannot be completed without congressional approval and sets the stage for a seismic political and legal battle over the federal government's role in the nation's schools.Surrounded by schoolchildren seated at desks in the East Room of White House, Trump signed a long-awaited executive order that he said would begin dismantling the department ""once and for all"". The Trump administration has cited poor test scores as a key justification for the move. ""We're going to shut it down, and shut it down as quickly as possible,"" he said.The department, which manages federal loans for college, tracks student achievement and supports programmes for students with disabilities, was created by an act of Congress. That means, only Congress can shut it down.However, Trump has already taken significant steps that have limited the agency's operations and authority. Since Trump's inauguration, his administration has slashed the department's workforce by more than half and eliminated $600 million in grants. The job cuts hit particularly hard at the department's Office for Civil Rights, which enforces the country's guarantee that all students have an equal opportunity to an education.Trump's order contains potentially contradictory guidance for McMahon. On the one hand, the order directs her to facilitate the elimination of the agency. On the other, she is also mandated to rigorously comply with federal law. The order offers no guidance on how to square those two points.Trump said the department would continue to provide critical functions that are required by law, such as the administration of federal student aid , including loans and grants, as well as funding for special education and districts with high levels of student poverty. The department would also continue civil rights enforcement , White House officials said.","US president Donald Trump has instructed education secretary Linda McMahon to begin shutting down her agency.

Three people have been arrested after Michigan authorities discovered them living in ""deplorable"" conditions with a 9-year-old boy, surrounded by starving, mistreated animals, including a dead puppy stuffed inside a pizza box, officials said.The shocking case unfolded in Flint when AT&T workers reported $30,000 worth of stolen cables from a nearby work site, prompting deputies from the Genesee County sheriff 's office to investigate, sheriff Christopher Swanson said.Upon arrival, deputies were met with a disturbing scene: a dead dog locked inside a cage outside the home. Inside, they found dogs so emaciated that they appeared to have gone without food for weeks—and a horrifying discovery of a puppy's remains inside a pizza box.""You don't treat animals this way,"" Swanson said in a video statement, visibly outraged by the neglect.In addition to the appalling conditions, deputies found a 9-year-old boy living among the filth. Swanson did not specify the child's exact relationship with the three adults but called the situation unacceptable.""Three adults, two dead dogs, two emaciated dogs and a 9-year-old boy,"" he said, calling the case one of severe neglect.The suspects Kelly Walker, 29, Charles Ashbaker, 38, and Douglas Nelson, 47, now face multiple charges.

So, too was Schlesinger's statement that 47% political officers in US embassies were controlled by CIA.Some readers view it as evidence of both mistrust between Kennedy and CIA and a reason CIA at least would not make Kennedy's security a high priority ahead of his assassination in Dallas on Nov 22, 1963.That gave fresh attention Thursday to a decades-old theory about who killed JFK - the CIA had a hand in it.Some Kennedy scholars said they haven't yet seen anything in the 63,000 pages of material released under an order from President Trump that undercuts the conclusion Lee Harvey Oswald , a 24-year-old Marine and one-time defector to Soviet Union, was a lone gunman. But they also say they understand why doubters gravitate toward the theory. ""You have this young, charismatic president with so much potential for the future, and on the other side of the scale, you have this 24-year-old waif, Oswald, and it doesn't balance,"" said Gerald Posner, whose book, ""Case Closed,"" details the evidence that Oswald was a lone gunman.Jefferson Morley, editor of JFK Facts blog, said there is still more unreleased material, including 2,400 files FBI said it discovered after Trump issued his order in Jan, and material held by the Kennedy family.Kennedy was killed on a visit to Dallas, when his motorcade was finishing its parade route and shots rang out from Texas School Book Depository building. Police arrested Oswald, who had positioned himself from a sniper's perch on the sixth floor. Two days later, Jack Ruby, a nightclub owner, fatally shot Oswald during a jail transfer broadcast live on television.""It was the first big event that led to a series of events involving conspiracy theories that left Americans believing their govt lies so often they shouldn't pay close attention,"" said Larry Sabato, author of ""The Kennedy Half-Century"".Kennedy had inherited the Bay of Pigs plan from predecessor President Dwight Eisenhower, and had been in office less than three months when the operation launched in April 1961 as a covert invasion to topple Cuban leader Fidel Castro.Schlesinger's 15-page memo ends with a proposal to give control of covert activities to state department and to split CIA into two agencies. Morley sees it as a response to Kennedy's anger over the Bay of Pigs and something Kennedy was seriously contemplating. The plan never came to fruition.Sabato said Kennedy simply ""needed the CIA"" in the Cold War conflict with the Soviet Union and its allies like Cuba, and a huge reorganisation would have hindered intel operations. He added the president and his brother, attorney general Robert F Kennedy, wanted to oust Castro before JFK ran for reelection in 1964. Timothy Naftali, an adjunct professor at Columbia University, discounts the idea of tensions between the president and CIA lasting until Kennedy's death. For one thing, he said, JFK used covert operations ""avidly"".","A key adviser warned President John F Kennedy after the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba in 1961 the agency behind it, CIA, had grown too powerful.

A Southwest Airlines flight aborted takeoff at Orlando airport after it mistakenly began to depart on a taxiwa rather than the runway. An air traffic controller at Florida airport cancelled the takeoff clearance for Southwest Flight 3278 after the aircraft began its takeoff roll on a taxiway that runs parallel to the runway, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said. Taxiways are paths used by pilots to move the aircraft between the terminal and the runway. Southwest said the Boeing 737-800 stopped safely on the taxiway, returned to the gate and no injuries were reported. Investigations are under way. Southwest said it is engaged with FAA to understand the circumstances of the event and accommodated customers on another aircraft to their destination.A man who once worked as a sound engineer for rapper Eminem has been charged with leaking and selling his unreleased music online for about $50,000 in bitcoin, according to prosecutors.

UK issues new travel advice for citizens going to US

Though Canada has not issued any travel advisory against visiting the United States, Canadian lawmaker Charlie Angus issued a warning against travelling to the US as he claimed that Canadian citizens are being kidnapped by ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) agents. ""We have seen too many stories of citizens being pulled out of airport lines, and being fingerprinted and deported, as if they were criminals. Citizens being kidnapped to illegal detention by ICE…this is not the actions of a Democratic nation,"" New Democratic Party's leader said. While Canada and US have locked horns in a tariff war, the travel warning coincides with the Trump administration's border crackdown.""Canada will never kiss that gangster's ring. We are truth, we are north, we are strong, we are free, we will not bend, and we will not give an inch,"" Angus said in a press conference.Canadian actor Jasmine Mooney who starred in an American Pie video said she was put in chains when she went to renew her visa at the San Ysidro border crossing. She said she was told that she was in the wrong place and that she should have gone to a US consulate. After some to and fro, she was put into ICE custody as she failed to explain to the officers that she was not trying to enter the US illegally. After 12 days of detention, she was finally released and allowed to fly back to Canada.In a massive crackdown on illegal immigrants, the Trump administration has been on an arrest spree. The arrest of two green card holders, Mahmoud Khalil and Badar Khan Suri, created ripples as the administration is planning to deport them.

Growing worries about deportations

Calls for international help

Zahra Mousavi, a women's rights activist, fled from Afghanistan to neighboring Pakistan in March 2022 after months of fighting and protesting the oppressive Taliban regime She now lives in hiding and constant fear of being apprehended by the Pakistani police and deported to her home country.Mousavi actively participated in street protests against the Taliban regime after the Islamic fundamentalist group seized power in the war-ravaged country in August 2021.She advocated for women's rights by taking part in public gatherings and demonstrations, and tried to make the voices of Afghan women heard in the rest of the world.But with the Taliban slapping broad restrictions on women and girls and gradually squeezing them out of public life, Mousavi was forced to leave.In Pakistan, however, she has struggled to secure the necessary documents to stay in the country.""I could not obtain a valid Pakistani visa for myself and my family due to high costs and Pakistan's strict visa policies,"" the 29-year-old told DW.""This led to my arrest by Pakistani police on February 22. They entered my home in plain clothes, conducted an intense search, and arrested both me and my young daughter, taking us to a deportation detention camp,"" she said.""We were kept there in extremely harsh conditions for two days and one night, and we were only released after providing guarantees and due to the pressure of human rights activists.""DW spoke to several other Afghan female activists, who are also living in hiding as Islamabad looks to accelerate deportations to Afghanistan.Jamila Ahmadi, 27, said many of her fellow Afghan women had already been sent back to Afghanistan and warned that their lives, as well as hers, were in danger.""My activism, especially my efforts toward women's capacity-building before the Taliban takeover, my reporting on Taliban crimes, and my involvement with the National Directorate of Security (NDS), has placed me in significant danger,"" Ahmadi said.""If I am compelled to return to Taliban rule, it would clearly be a certain death.""Many women's rights activists only sought asylum in Pakistan when the situation became untenable in Taliban-ruled Afghanistan.""In February 2021, I was attacked, resulting in a broken leg, but my determination remained unshaken,"" said Ahmadi.""Again, in September 2021, we were brutally beaten by the Taliban.""Pakistan has hosted millions of Afghan refugees for decades.But over the last three years, Pakistan's relationship with Afghanistan has deteriorated.Islamabad is angry with the Taliban authorities over the operations of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a militant group that formed in 2007 and has conducted numerous attacks on Pakistani security forces.As cross-border tensions escalate, concerns about the well-being of Afghans in Pakistan have increased.Islamabad is currently carrying out a huge drive to repatriate the roughly 4 million Afghans who have crossed the border in the past four decades.Pakistan already repatriated more than 800,000 Afghan refugees between September 2023 and the end of last year, according to the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR).Legal experts and refugee rights activists have criticized the Pakistani government's deportation plans, particularly when it comes to deporting Afghan women's rights activists .""Sending activists back to Afghanistan, where they are very likely to be subjected to torture at the hands of the Taliban regime, would put them in greater risk,"" Osama Malik, a refugee lawyer in Islamabad, told DW.Ahmadi said her health had been affected by the deportation drive.""Unfortunately, for more than a month, the Pakistani police have made life difficult for refugees, including issues with visas and visa extensions.

Who was Abu Qatal?



A key operative of LeT, he was involved in planning and executing multiple attacks in Jammu and Kashmir.

He was also known as Faisal Nadeem .

Qatal had strong ties with Hafiz Saeed , the mastermind behind the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks.

His terror activities date back to 2002-03 when he infiltrated India and operated in the Poonch-Rajouri region.

He founded terror outfits like People’s Anti-Fascist Force (PAFF) and The Resistant Force (TRF) to hide LeT and Jaish-e-Mohammed’s (JeM) activities.

Played a key role in the June 9 Reasi attack, where terrorists opened fire on a bus carrying pilgrims from Shiv Khori temple, killing nine and injuring 41.

PAFF, one of his proxy groups, was designated a terrorist organization by ministry of home affairs on January 7, 2023.

Abu Qatal , a top Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) operative and one of the most wanted terrorists, was gunned down by unidentified assailants in Pakistan's Jhelum Sindh on Saturday night.He was a high-priority target for Indian security agencies, including the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and the Indian Army, for his involvement in the 2023 Rajouri attack and the 2024 Reasi bus attack , along with other deadly assaults in Jammu and Kashmir.","Abu Qatal, a top Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) operative, was gunned down by unidentified assailants in Pakistan's Jhelum Sindh on Saturday night.

Authorities have yet to confirm any casualties in that attack.Pakistan's military is engaged in an ongoing operation in Kurram, an area that has witnessed years of violence between Sunni and Shia Muslim communities, as reported by Al Jazeera. Hundreds of people have been killed in fighting between armed groups, exacerbating tensions in the region.Kurram has remained isolated since last November, after authorities blocked key roads following sectarian violence. The closure has led to severe shortages of medicine and food, deepening a humanitarian crisis.In another incident, a bomb exploded outside a mosque in the northwestern city of Peshawar, killing a religious leader, local police said on Saturday. It was unclear who was behind the attack, and an investigation was being conducted.","Pakistani security forces raid two hideouts used by an armed group, triggering gun battles.

DHAKA: A fresh controversy convulsed Bangladesh on Friday after the National Citizen Party (NCP), launched by Nahid Islam - man who led the anti-Sheikh Hasina movement - alleged that efforts are being made by the ""army"" to relaunch the Awami League under a new name, "" Refined Awami League "", as part of an India-sponsored conspiracy.The allegations came on a day the army had to be deployed in Dhaka along with police in view of demonstrations by student groups and hardline Islamist organisation Hefazat-e-Islam to demand a ban on the Awami League. On Thursday, Bangladesh chief adviser Muhammad Yunus said there are no plans to ban the Awami League but individuals within its leadership will be tried for ""crimes against humanity"".In a Facebook post, NCP leader Hasnat Abdullah said the proposal for this ""Refined Awami League, led by Awami league members Saber Hossain Chowdhury, Shirin Sharmin Chaudhury and Fazle Noor Taposh"" was placed before him and two others on March 11 by ""the cantonment"", an apparent reference to the army.Referring to the last year ""July uprising"" that led to the ouster of the Hasina-led Awami League govt, he said, ""In July, your powerful movement helped us discard all prescriptions from cantonment and agencies. If you stand by us again today, if you join us on the streets, we will once again defeat this Indian conspiracy to rehabilitate the Awami League.""""We were asked to accept the proposal in exchange for a seat-sharing agreement for the next national election,"" Hasnat said, adding, ""at the cantonment, we were told that more than one political party has already been given this proposal, and they have agreed to the rehabilitation of the Awami League on certain conditions.""He did not tell who approached him. ""We were further told that those who will lead this 'Refined Awami League' will start publicly admitting to the crimes of the Sheikh family from April-May onwards, distancing themselves from Hasina while pledging allegiance only to Bangabandhu's Awami League."" The proposal, he said, was immediately rejected with the assertion that efforts should be made to prosecute Awami members.In Oct last year, ex-environment minister Saber Chowdhury was freed from jail after bail in all six cases filed against him, while Shirin Chaudhury & Taposh were not arrested.","National Citizen Party (NCP), launched by Nahid Islam - man who led the anti- Sheikh Hasina movement.

This statement comes a day after the country’s interim government announced that it had no plans to ban the party.BNP spokesperson Ruhul Kabir Rizvi said that Awami League’s political comeback should be contingent on its leadership being free from criminal charges.“There should be no restriction on Awami League's return to politics if it selects a leader who is not guilty of any crime, has not killed students, and has not misappropriated or laundered money abroad,” Rizvi said, according to news agency PTI.He further added, “We have nothing to say if the people accept Awami League after a swift trial of those responsible for crimes committed under their regime.” However, he warned against the return of authoritarian rule, emphasizing that democracy should determine the party’s future.Rizvi’s remarks came after interim government chief Muhammad Yunus assured a delegation from the International Crisis Group that his administration ""has no plans to ban the Awami League."" However, he clarified that individuals within the party accused of serious crimes—including murder and crimes against humanity—would face prosecution in Bangladesh’s courts.Yunus also indicated that Awami League leaders could be referred to the International Criminal Court (ICC) following a UN fact-finding mission that uncovered potential crimes during the July-August 2024 protests, which led to Hasina’s ouster. ""It is very much on the table,"" he said.Hasina has been in India since August 5, 2024, after fleeing Bangladesh amid mass student-led protests that brought an end to her nearly 16-year rule. The Bangladesh International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) has issued arrest warrants against Hasina and several of her former ministers, advisers, and military and civil officials for “crimes against humanity and genocide.”The debate over Awami League’s future intensified on Friday as two student groups from Dhaka University—the Bangladesh Democratic Students' Council (BDSC) and Inquilab Mancha—held separate protests demanding the party be barred from contesting elections.The BNP, however, has consistently opposed banning political parties. Following Hasina’s removal, the Students Against Discrimination (SAD)—which spearheaded the protests—also pushed for Awami League’s exclusion from politics. Some SAD leaders later formed a political party, the National Citizen Party (NCP), which is advocating for the establishment of a ‘Second Republic’ and the abolition of Bangladesh’s 1972 constitution.One of NCP’s key leaders, Hasnat Abdullah, claimed in a Facebook post that there was a “conspiracy to rehabilitate Awami League” under a refined version, allegedly backed by India. He alleged that on March 11, he and two other NCP members were approached by military officials with a proposal to accept the “Refined Awami League” in exchange for a seat-sharing arrangement.“We were told that multiple political parties had already agreed to the proposal on certain conditions,” Abdullah claimed. “According to them, having several opposition parties, including a weak Awami League, is preferable to having a single strong opposition.”He said the NCP outright rejected the proposal, arguing that Awami League should face prosecution instead of rehabilitation. However, those who made the offer allegedly warned that SAD and NCP would have to bear responsibility for any political crisis resulting from their refusal.Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI), a former ally of BNP, has also backed NCP’s stance on Awami League. JeI chief Shafiqur Rahman asserted, “People will not accept the rehabilitation of Awami League.”As political tensions rise, calls for accountability and justice remain at the forefront of Bangladesh’s evolving political landscape.",Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) says it has no objection to Awami League's return to politics. BNP spokesperson Ruhul Kabir Rizvi said party's leadership should be free from criminal charges. Interim government chief Muhammad Yunus said he has no plans to ban the party.

Recently, India has increased security around the Dalai Lama in response to Beijing’s growing interest in his succession. The United States has consistently supported Tibet’s religious freedom.

The Dalai Lama’s succession has long been a point of contention between Tibetans and China, but his latest statement has escalated the dispute. In his newly published book,, the 89-year-old Tibetan spiritual leader has explicitly stated for the first time that his successor will be born in the ""free world""—outside of China. This defies Beijing’s longstanding claim that it has the sole right to choose the next Dalai Lama.For China, controlling the Dalai Lama’s succession is about more than religion—it’s about political authority and maintaining control over Tibet. The Dalai Lama, who fled to India in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule, has long been regarded as a “separatist” by Beijing. With his 90th birthday approaching in July, the question of who will succeed him has become urgent, as it could determine the future of Tibetan Buddhism and Tibet’s political movement. Below, we break down the key issues surrounding this controversy.Also read: ‘Will be born in free world’: Dalai Lama declares successor will be born outside China; Beijing counters China considers the Dalai Lama to be a symbol of Tibetan resistance and fears that an independent successor could fuel separatist sentiments. By controlling the reincarnation process, Beijing hopes to install a Dalai Lama loyal to the Chinese government, ensuring tighter control over Tibet. The current Dalai Lama, however, has made it clear that any successor appointed by China will not be respected by Tibetans:According to Tibetan Buddhist tradition, the Dalai Lama is reincarnated, and his successor is identified by senior monks through visions, signs, and tests. Historically, this process has been free from political interference. However, China insists that it has the final say, citing historical conventions:– Mao Ning, Chinese foreign ministry spokespersonIn, the Dalai Lama explains that his successor must be free from Chinese control to continue his spiritual and humanitarian mission:This move is intended to prevent China from appointing a successor who would serve its political interests rather than uphold the spiritual and cultural values of Tibetan Buddhism.Beijing has dismissed the Dalai Lama’s remarks, insisting that it alone has the authority to choose his successor. The Chinese Foreign Ministry called him:They also reiterated that the reincarnation must follow government regulations:The controversy over the Panchen Lama—a senior figure in Tibetan Buddhism—illustrates China’s approach to religious succession. In 1995, the Dalai Lama identified a six-year-old boy, Gedhun Choekyi Nyima, as the 11th Panchen Lama. Shortly after, the Chinese government abducted the child and appointed its own Panchen Lama, Gyaltsen Norbu, who is seen by many Tibetans as illegitimate.The original Panchen Lama has not been seen since, with China claiming that he is now living a ""normal life."" This fuels fears that Beijing will follow the same strategy with the next Dalai Lama.If China installs a Dalai Lama of its choosing, Tibetans and the global Buddhist community are unlikely to accept him. This could lead to two rival Dalai Lamas—one recognized by Tibetans in exile and another by China. The Dalai Lama himself has warned:A divided leadership could deepen the Tibetan resistance against Chinese rule and further strain China’s relations with the international community.The dispute over the Dalai Lama’s succession has global implications, especially for China’s relations with India and the US.Beijing has condemned such foreign involvement as an attempt to destabilize China.In, the Dalai Lama expresses concern over Tibet’s fate under Chinese rule but remains hopeful:He also reaffirmed that the struggle for Tibetan freedom will continue beyond his lifetime:(With inputs from agencies)","Dalai Lama says his successor will be born in the ""free world""—outside of China.

The Mandalay People’s Defense Force (MDY-PDF), which has been resisting military rule, claimed the strike targeted a crowded market area.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119051339,imgsize-105894,width-400,resizemode-4/119051339.jpg"

The outage

'Non-suspicious'

LONDON: British Airways became the first carrier to resume operations at London's Heathrow Airport , following an 18-hour disruption due to a devastating electrical substation fire at Europe's busiest aviation hub.Power restoration enabled the British Airways aircraft to land before sunset on Friday after the airport lifted restrictions. Additional arrivals followed, including a flight from Manchester.A British Airways service, to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, departed just before 9 pm local time (Saturday, 2:30 am in India). The airline scheduled eight long-haul flights for Friday evening, with full operations planned for Saturday.The power outage impacted Heathrow and neighbouring residential areas. According to FlightRadar 24, at least 1,350 flights were affected.The incident led to extensive flight cancellations , routing complications and affected roughly 200,000 travellers. Approximately 120 aircraft were airborne when the closure was announced. Some returned to their departure points while others landed at alternative airports including Gatwick (London), Charles de Gaulle (Paris) and Shannon Airport (Ireland).It began shortly before midnight on Thursday at a substation located 2 miles (3.2 kilometres) from Heathrow. Firefighters spent about seven hours controlling the flames. The London Fire Brigade deployed 10 engines and approximately 70 firefighters, evacuating 150 local residents. While 67,000 customers lost power initially, most services were restored by morning.This disruption stands as one of the most significant since the 2010 Eyjafjallajokull volcano eruption in Iceland, which caused extensive European airspace closures.Heathrow, which handled 83.9 million (8.39 crore) passengers last year, ranks among the world's premier international airports. Standard flight operations there typically commence at 6 am due to night flight restrictions.The Metropolitan Police's counter-terrorism unit is leading investigations due to their rapid response capabilities and the substation's proximity to vital infrastructure, though they confirmed the incident appears ""non-suspicious.""Heathrow's emergency power system functioned as intended but proved insufficient for full operations. CEO Thomas Woldbye defended the airport's emergency preparations, describing the situation as ""unprecedented.""The incident prompted criticism regarding Britain's infrastructure resilience. Alan Mendoza from the Henry Jackson Society highlighted concerns about national infrastructure protection.Tom Wells, speaking for UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, acknowledged the need for a ""thorough investigation"" to prevent similar disruptions.","British Airways becomes first carrier to resume operations at London's Heathrow Airport.

"Ghostly sea monster with fins and hollow eyes washes up in UK, what is it?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/ghostly-sea-monster-with-fins-and-hollow-eyes-washes-up-in-uk-what-is-it/articleshow/119312804.cms,"Mysterious 'skeleton-like' creature with fins washes ashore in UK, baffling beachgoers (Pic credit: Melissa Hallman's X account)

A bizarre, unidentified sea creature with a skeletal head and fishtail has left beachgoers in the UK stunned, sparking speculation and intrigue online.The eerie-looking figure was found on March 10 by Paula Regan and her husband Dave as they strolled along the shore in Margate, Kent. Describing the strange find, Regan told South West News Service (SWNS), ""For the life of me, I can't tell you what it was. It was the weirdest thing.""Photos of the mysterious creature show its emaciated body partially buried in the sand, with a gaunt, alien-like head and scaled tail—resembling some kind of grotesque mermaid. ""At first, I thought it was a bit of driftwood or maybe a dead seal because I could see these funny tail fin things,"" Regan said. ""The head looked skeletal, but the back part—where the fishtail was—was soft and squidgy. It didn't feel slimy or decomposed, but it was definitely strange.""The discovery quickly drew a crowd of curious onlookers, including dog walkers and passersby. Even a man setting up nearby beach huts came over to inspect the bizarre find. ""Some thought it might have fallen off a boat, while others suggested it could be a figurehead from a ship—like one of those carved mermaids,"" Regan recounted. ""I just knew no one would believe us if we didn't take a picture.""This isn't the first time an unidentified sea creature has washed up on UK shores. Last spring, beachcombers were left in shock after a bloodsucking sea beast, roughly the size of a child, was discovered, drawing comparisons to the giant sandworms from Dune.For now, the true identity of the strange creature remains a mystery—an unidentified floating object that continues to baffle and intrigue.","Mysterious, unidentified sea creature washes ashore in Margate, Kent, on March 10.

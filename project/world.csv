DOHA: US President Donald Trump on Thursday closes a Middle East tour in the United Arab Emirates as he focuses squarely on seeking deals after billions of dollars of pledges from Saudi Arabia and Qatar.The first major trip of his second term had been scheduled to end Thursday but Trump, always ready with surprises, did not rule out continuing on to Turkey if Russian President Vladimir Putin shows up for talks with Ukraine.Trump will fly to the Emirati capital Abu Dhabi after a stop in Qatar, where the president hailed what he said was a record $200 billion deal for Boeing aircraft.He started the trip in Saudi Arabia which promised its own $600 billion in investment, including one of the largest-ever purchases of US weapons.The Gulf leaders' largesse has also stirred controversy, with Qatar offering Trump a luxury aeroplane ahead of his visit for presidential and then personal use, in what Trump's Democratic rivals charged was blatant corruption.Trump, who also chose Saudi Arabia for the opening visit of his first term, has been unabashed about seeking Gulf money and hailed the effect on creating jobs at home.In a speech in Riyadh, Trump attacked not only Democrats but also the traditional wing of his own Republican Party, which had championed US military intervention in Afghanistan and Iraq.Complimenting the skyline of the Saudi desert capital, Trump said: ""The gleaming marvels of Riyadh and Abu Dhabi were not created by the so-called 'nation-builders', 'neocons' or 'liberal non-profits', like those who spent trillions failing to develop Kabul and Baghdad.""""Instead, the birth of a modern Middle East has been brought about by the people of the region themselves,"" he said.""In the end, the so-called 'nation-builders' wrecked far more nations than they built.""Trump steered clear of any hint of criticism of the Gulf monarchies on human rights.Trump's predecessor Joe Biden had initially vowed to shun Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman over US intelligence findings that he ordered the gruesome murder in 2018 of Jamal Khashoggi -- a Saudi dissident writer who lived in the United States.Trump instead hailed the crown prince, who is Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler, as a visionary due to the kingdom's rapid economic investments.Trump also acceded to a key request by the crown prince in announcing a lifting of sanctions on Syria following the toppling of Bashar al-Assad in December.He met in Riyadh with Ahmed al-Sharaa, a former Islamist guerrilla once on the US wanted list who dressed in a suit and was complimented by Trump as a ""young, attractive guy"".Trump was joined in the meeting by Prince Mohammed and, virtually, by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the key supporter of the former Syrian rebels.Trump said Wednesday he was willing to travel to Turkey if Putin accepts an offer by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to meet on ending the war.Russia has given no indication that Putin will attend. Trump said that Secretary of State Marco Rubio would travel nonetheless to Istanbul for the potential talks.",US President Donald Trump closes a Middle East tour in the United Arab Emirates.

Michigan's Rep. Shri Thanedar backs down on Trump impeachment effort

Shri Thanedar Asked If Impeachment Articles Against Trump Might Have The 'Opposite Effect'





Indian-origin Rep Shri Thanedar’s bid to impeach US President Donald Trump collapsed on Wednesday after fierce resistance from within his own party.The Michigan Democrat , who filed seven articles of impeachment in April, said he was backing off from forcing a House vote, opting instead to revise his resolution and build support across party lines.“After talking with many colleagues, I have decided not to force a vote on impeachment today,” Thanedar said, adding, “I will add to my articles of impeachment and continue to rally the support of both Democrats and Republicans to defend the Constitution with me.”He also claimed Trump had committed “more impeachable offenses” since April, including “accepting a $400 million jet from Qatar,” reported CNN.Thanedar had moved Tuesday to classify his resolution as “privileged,” triggering a mandatory vote within two legislative days. But by Wednesday afternoon, under pressure from Democratic leaders and colleagues, he reversed course.According to CBS News, the House had been preparing to table the motion, a move that would have effectively killed it.His articles accuse Trump of obstructing justice, abusing executive power, violating the First Amendment, and unlawfully creating the department of government efficiency (DOGE). Yet, his effort was swiftly dismissed even by fellow Democrats.Top judiciary Democrat Rep Jerry Nadler called the idea “idiotic” in a closed-door meeting, a remark that was met with applause, reported CNN.Democratic leadership, blindsided by the move, were frustrated. House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries’ team believed Thanedar had previously assured them he wouldn’t proceed. Rep Greg Stanton of Arizona criticised the timing, saying, “Any Democrat not focused on getting us to 218 is either wasting our time or helping Republicans.”Rep Jamie Raskin was quoted by CBS News as saying, “It’s not enough to be right. You need consensus. You need a strategy.” Leadership was particularly concerned that the motion would distract from their focus on opposing GOP-led spending cuts to Medicaid and food assistance. CBS News also quoted Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar as saying, “This is not the right approach… Everything else is a distraction.”Thanedar defended himself during a press conference, saying, “Many people in my party and elsewhere say, ‘Is this the right time?’ People all over the country are saying this is the right time to do it!” He added, “Some Democrats have called me a lunatic, just like the president has called me lunatic.”His resolution faced problems from the start.As per Fox News, four Democratic co-sponsors withdrew their names after learning the resolution wasn’t cleared with party leadership. Meanwhile, a White House spokesperson dismissed the move as a “reckless political act,” calling Trump’s actions “fully lawful and firmly rooted in the will of the American people.”This isn’t the first time Thanedar has taken a maverick stance. He faces a tough primary fight and his impeachment gambit may have been partly aimed at energising his base. But even he acknowledged the uphill battle, saying, “We’re not only going to fight the winning fights. We’re going to do it because it’s the right thing to do.”For now, Thanedar has stepped back but not out. “This is a process,” he said. “It’s not going to happen tomorrow or Thursday, but it’s a start.”","Michigan's Rep.

RFK Jr. says people should not take medical advice from him during House hearing





US health and human services secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr stunned lawmakers during congressional hearings on Wednesday by repeatedly refusing to endorse childhood vaccinations and telling the public not to take medical advice from him, despite leading the nation's top public health agency.Pressed by Rep Mark Pocan, during a House Appropriations Committee hearing, Kennedy hesitated when asked if he would vaccinate his child against measles. “For measles? Probably for measles” he asked.“My opinions about vaccines are irrelevant. I don’t want to seem like I’m being evasive, but I don’t think people should be taking medical advice from me,” he said, according to The New York Times.When Pocan followed up about chickenpox and polio vaccines, Kennedy again dodged. “I don’t want to give advice,” he said, despite overseeing agencies like the CDC that are responsible for issuing vaccine recommendations.Kennedy later added, “I think what we're going to try to do is lay out the pros and cons, the risks and benefits, accurately as we understand them, with replicable studies.”His reluctance came amid a worsening measles outbreak in the US , with over 1,000 cases nationwide, including 709 in Texas alone. Two unvaccinated children have died, according to CBS News.Kennedy’s refusal to clearly support vaccines drew backlash, especially given his long history of promoting vaccine scepticism. Sen Chris Murphy, told him, “The secretary of health and human services is no longer recommending the measles vaccines… I think that’s really dangerous,” reported The Guardian.Kennedy's comments also contradicted his April interview with CBS News, where he finally acknowledged the benefits of the measles vaccine and said, “People should get the measles vaccine,” while still opposing mandates.During the hearing, Kennedy also made misleading claims, including saying Europe doesn’t use chickenpox vaccines, though 28 European countries do, with many having national immunisation programmes, according to The New York TimesBeyond vaccines, Kennedy faced criticism for sweeping staff and budget cuts.He has eliminated about 20,000 jobs and slashed $2.7 billion in research funding, including a 31% cut to cancer research. He defended these decisions vaguely, saying a court order prevented him from discussing reorganisation plans. But Georgetown law professor Lawrence Gostin was quoted by The Guardian as saying that Kennedy’s claim was “pure nonsense.”As Republicans push to extend Trump-era tax cuts by cutting healthcare subsidies, the Congressional Budget Office estimates 13.7 million more Americans could lose coverage.Advocacy groups have warned the proposed Medicaid work requirements are designed to push people off the programme.Despite the chaos, Kennedy confirmed he had reinstated some health programmes, including the World Trade Center Health Program and black lung research, after pushback from Republican lawmakers.Still, Democrats accused him of playing political favourites with which programmes survive. Rep Rosa DeLauro asked pointedly, “Is there a special phone number if I want to save tobacco prevention, lead poisoning?”","US health and human services secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr stunned lawmakers during congressional hearings on Wednesday.

Ben Cohen, co-founder of the progressive ice cream brand Ben & Jerry’s, was arrested on Capitol Hill on Wednesday during a protest that disrupted a Senate hearing involving health and human services secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr.According to Fox News, Cohen was among seven individuals detained by the United States Capitol Police (USCP) during the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee hearing. He was charged with “crowding, obstructing, or incommoding,” while others faced additional charges of resisting arrest and assaulting police officers.The protest erupted shortly after Kennedy began his testimony, with demonstrators shouting, “RFK kills people with hate!” as seen in footage.USA Today reported some protesters moved toward the front of the hearing room and were forcibly removed by police. Video showed Cohen being pulled out by an officer as Sen Bill Cassidy, who was chairing the session, paused the proceedings. “That was a made-for-C-SPAN moment,” Cassidy remarked after order was restored.Cohen, a long-time activist, later said on X, formerly Twitter, “I told Congress they're killing poor kids in Gaza by buying bombs, and they're paying for it by kicking poor kids off Medicaid in the US.”Sharing footage of his removal, he added, “This was the authorities' response”.Earlier that day, Cohen also appeared at a press conference with Representative Rashida Tlaib and other progressive activists, criticising US support for Israel during its ongoing war in Gaza.“We are expected to be good Americans and look the other way as Israel prevents food, water and medicine from reaching the remaining people of Gaza,” Cohen said, as quoted by USA Today. “We will not look away. We will not be silenced.”Cohen’s arrest is not his first in Washington. In 2023, he was detained while protesting outside the department of justice over the imprisonment of Julian Assange, Fox News noted.Ben & Jerry’s has long been associated with left-leaning political activism. The company, acquired by Unilever in 2000, still maintains an independent board to preserve its advocacy work. In 2021, it made headlines by halting sales in Israeli settlements in the West Bank, referring to them as “Occupied Palestinian Territory,” reported Axios.","Ben Cohen, co-founder of the progressive ice cream brand Ben & Jerry’s, was arrested on Capitol Hill on Wednesday during a protest.

Poll Do you believe NATO should increase defense spending to 5% of GDP? Yes, it's necessary for security. No, it's too high a target.

Talks on Ukraine also in Turkey



Trump administration pushes for NATO members to spend more on defence







ANTALYA: US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and his Nato counterparts meet in Turkey on Thursday to prepare a pivotal summit of alliance leaders next month that will set the course for future European security as America focuses on challenges elsewhere.The meeting in the Mediterranean coastal city of Antalya comes amid a flurry of negotiations aimed at producing a ceasefire agreement between Russia and Ukraine, including talks in Istanbul that Rubio and President Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff plan to attend Friday. Rubio and Witkoff are coming to Turkey after accompanying Trump on portions of his trip to Gulf Arab countries.On the sidelines of the Nato meeting, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha met Wednesday with Rubio, who also is having separate talks with new German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul and Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan of Turkey, whose country is trying to help broker a deal that might end the more than three-year-old war.Sybiha and Fidan on Wednesday discussed efforts to establish a ceasefire and steps toward securing a lasting peace with Russia, according to the Turkish foreign ministry.The same day that Nato foreign ministers gather, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is set to meet with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara. It's an open question whether Trump or Russian President Vladimir Putin will participate Thursday.Trump teased a possible visit to Istanbul while flying from Saudi Arabia to Qatar on Wednesday, but there was no immediate indication that his travel plans would change.""He'd like me to be there, and that's a possibility,"" Trump said, referring to Putin. ""I don't know that he would be there if I'm not there. We're going to find out.""Zelenskyy has been pushing for direct talks with Russia but only if Putin attends. Putin, who has rebuffed previous such calls, has been coy and has not committed to a meeting.The Kremlin on Wednesday said Putin's aide, Vladimir Medinsky, will head the Russian delegation, which also will include Deputy Defense Minister Alexander Fomin, Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Galuzin and Igor Kostyukov, chief of the General Staff's main directorate. The list did not include Putin himself.Zelenskyy also remains keen on Ukraine joining Nato, which Russia has adamantly rejected and Trump appears to have agreed with. So even with a Ukrainian presence in Antalya, it appeared unlikely there would be any decisions made about Ukraine's future, or lack thereof, in the military alliance.Of greater concern to the US is money, with the Trump administration saying it wants to hear how European members of Nato and Canada plan to boost their national defense investments to 5% of gross domestic product.In 2023, as Russia's full-scale war on Ukraine entered its second year, Nato leaders agreed to spend at least 2% of GDP on national defense budgets. So far, 22 of the 32 member countries have done so.The leaders will set a new goal at a summit in The Hague on June 25. Trump insists that US allies should commit to spending at least 5% to be ready to defend themselves, but that would require investment at an unprecedented scale.Trump has cast doubt over whether the US would defend allies that spend too little. The US was projected to have spent 3.38% last year, Nato figures show, the only ally whose spending has dropped over the last decade. Asked last month whether the US would match the 5% target, Rubio said, ""Sure. We're heading there now.""""Make no mistake, this ministerial is going to be different,"" US envoy to Nato Matthew Whitaker said this week, adding that ""5% is not just a number, it is a necessity for our security. The alliance is facing significant threats.""He did not outline those threats. Nato leaders insisted at their summit last year that ""Russia remains the most significant and direct threat to Allies' security,"" but some countries are uneasy about Trump reengaging with Putin.Fidan, the Turkish foreign minister who is hosting the meeting, is expected to express Turkey's commitment to strengthening NATO and call for the inclusion of NATO allies that aren't European Union members - such as Turkey - into European security and defense initiatives, according to Turkish officials.Fidan also would advocate a comprehensive, ""360-degree security"" approach focusing not only on ending the Russia-Ukraine war but also on stability in the Middle East and regions adjacent to NATO members, the officials said.The plan on higher defense spending Meanwhile, the defense spending plan under consideration appears to be for all allies to aim for 3.5% of GDP on ""hard military spending by 2032,"" and an extra ""1.5% related spending (on) infrastructure, cybersecurity and things like that. Also achievable by 2032,"" according to the Dutch government.While the two figures add up to 5%, factoring in infrastructure and cybersecurity would change the basis on which Nato traditionally calculates defense spending. The seven-year time frame is also short by the alliance's usual standards.Whitaker, the US Nato ambassador, appeared this week to confirm the plan, saying it ""also includes things like mobility, necessary infrastructure, cybersecurity. It is definitely more than just missiles, tanks and howitzers.""It's difficult to see how many allies might reach even 3.5% of GDP.

RIO DE JANEIRO: Deforestation slowed in all of Brazil's nature biomes for the first time in six years in 2024, according to a report issued months before the country hosts a major UN climate conference.The total area deforested in South America's biggest country was 32.4 percent lower than in 2023, some 1.24 million hectares, the report by monitoring agency MapBiomas said Thursday.It was the second year in a row of lower deforestation, with 2023 also recording a drop of 11 percent from the previous year.Leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has pledged to eradicate illegal deforestation by 2030, and wants to make Brazil a leader in the fight against global warming -- in which carbon-absorbing forests play a key role.Yet despite the advances, Brazil still lost about 3,403 hectares of native vegetation -- more than 8,000 football fields -- daily in 2024.Brazil is home to six biomes, each with its own climate, vegetation and animal life: the Amazon, the Atlantic Forest, the Cerrado, the Caatinga, the Pantanal, and the Pampa.In the Amazon, the largest tropical rainforest on the planet, logging destroyed an average of 1,035 hectares daily, or ""about seven trees per second,"" the report said, mostly to clear land for agriculture.The Cerrado, a tropical savanna rich in biodiversity, was the biome most affected by clearing for the second year in a row, losing 652,197 hectares -- an area similar in size to the megacity of Sao Paulo.Two-thirds of Indigenous lands recorded no deforestation in 2024, said the report.Deforestation is the intentional destruction of vegetation, and does not include forest fires, which reached record levels in Brazil last year, fueled by extreme heat and drought worsened by climate change.COP30, the next round of UN climate talks, are due to take place in the Amazonian city of Belem in November.",Deforestation slows in all of Brazil's nature biomes for first time in six years in 2024.

American rapper Kid Cudi’s car mysteriously exploded in his driveway shortly after Sean “Diddy” Combs threatened to blow it up, his ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura testified in a New York court on Wednesday.The claim came during Combs’ ongoing sex-trafficking and racketeering trial, where Ventura is a key government witness. She told the jury that the threat came in late 2011, shortly after the hip-hop mogul discovered she had started dating Cudi, whose real name is Scott Mescudi , reports the New York Post.“He mentioned when we were out of the country that Scott’s car would be blown up and he wanted his friends to see it,” Ventura said in her testimony.Later, when she and Combs met Cudi at SoHo House in New York, she recalled the rapper asking, “What about my vehicle?” Combs coolly responded, “What vehicle?” and said no more. The meeting ended there.Ventura and Combs were in a volatile relationship that lasted 11 years. She first publicly alleged in a 2023 civil lawsuit that Combs had made the car bomb threat, and that Cudi’s vehicle had exploded around the same time.In court, Ventura detailed how Combs discovered her relationship with Cudi. She said he went through her phone during what she described as a “freak-off,” a term used for the sexual events Combs allegedly organised. He found emails between her and one of his assistants, Capricorn Clark, about delivering her toiletries to Cudi’s home.After the discovery, Ventura said Combs “lunged” at her with a corkscrew and later kicked her in the back as she left his home. The court was shown photos of bruises she suffered on her back and legs, which were taken by her mother.She also described disturbing scenes in her hotel room that night, claiming she returned to find the toilet full of faeces, furniture knocked over, and urine on the floor.An email Ventura wrote in December 2011 to her mother and Clark was also read in court. “The threats that [Sean Combs] has made of me are that he will release 2 sexually explicit videos: one on xmas day [and one other],” she wrote.Ventura admitted that she downplayed the abuse when she first told her mother. “No, I told her it was the first time,” she said when asked if she had been open about the violence.Combs has pleaded not guilty to sex-trafficking and racketeering charges. If convicted, he could face a life sentence.","Cassie Ventura testified in Sean Combs' sex-trafficking and racketeering trial.

On Trump’s Nobel Prize prospects





A Pakistani journalist faced a sharp rebuff from the US state department official after attempting to question Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s stance on de-escalation talks between India and Pakistan. During a briefing on Wednesday, the Pakistani journalist portrayed former US President Donald Trump as a peace broker in the India-Pakistan standoff and claimed that India, particularly PM Modi, did not welcome Trump’s supposed ceasefire efforts.""Pakistan welcomed President Trump's efforts for bringing the ceasefire between Pakistan and India, and they believe that President Trump could win a Nobel Peace Prize if he were to bring peace between Pakistan and India on the Kashmir issue. But Prime Minister Modi did not welcome this effort... Does that disappoint this building at all, the attitude of Narendra Modi of not welcoming this peace deal,"" the reporter asked Tommy Pigott, principal deputy spokesperson at the US department of state.Sidestepping the pointed query, Pigott emphasised that the US was focused on maintaining the ceasefire. “That is what we are happy to see. That's where our focus remains. And we want to see a ceasefire be maintained, and we want to encourage direct communication.That is our focus here. Our focus is the ceasefire,” he said. Pigott reiterated that both India and Pakistan should maintain direct communication and pursue peace.While Trump has repeatedly claimed that his administration facilitated the India-Pakistan ceasefire, India has asserted that it was Pakistan’s Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) who reached out to his Indian counterpart seeking a truce, driven by pressure after Indian strikes.Responding to the reporter’s claim that Trump deserved a Nobel Peace Prize for his role in easing India-Pakistan tensions, Pigott described Trump as a ""peacemaker.""""He's a peacemaker. He values peace. He's also a dealmaker, and he has shown that again and again and again in terms of both pursuing an America First agenda but also pursuing peace and wanting to see peace and conflicts come to an end,"" Pigott said.The journalist also brought up the use of Israeli drones by India during Operation Sindoor and questioned whether that might create complications between Pakistan and Israel, given Trump's Abraham Accords aimed at fostering ties among Jews, Muslims, and Christians.Pigott, however, steered the conversation back to Washington’s stated priorities: maintaining the ceasefire and encouraging direct dialogue between India and Pakistan. He reiterated that the US focus remains on resolving conflicts through peaceful means.","A Pakistani journalist portrayed former US President Donald Trump as a peace broker in the India-Pakistan standoff.

US health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. told lawmakers on Wednesday that Americans “should not be taking medical advice” from him, reports news agency Reuters.Kennedy defended job cuts under the Trump administration and his controversial vaccine remarks during his first appearance before Congress.Being a long-time critic of vaccines, Kennedy was grilled by both the House Appropriations Committee and the Senate HELP Committee during back-to-back hearings. His remarks came amid a measles outbreak that has infected over 1,000 people and led to three deaths, mostly among the unvaccinated.When asked if he would give his children the measles vaccine today, Kennedy replied, “Measles? Probably for measles, what I would say is my opinions about vaccines are irrelevant. I don’t think people should be taking advice, medical advice, from me.”The hearings were meant to review US President Donald Trump ’s proposed 2026 health budget. Kennedy was confirmed in February and has already fired 10,000 staff across key agencies, including the FDA and CDC.He has also supported slashing $18 billion from the National Institutes of Health and $3.6 billion from the CDC, claiming the changes would “save taxpayers $1.8 billion per year.”“Our reductions have focused on aligning HHS staffing levels to reflect the size of HHS prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, which saw around a 15% increase in the number of employees,” Kennedy told the House subcommittee.Democrats slammed the cuts as dangerous. “All while you peddle unfounded and dangerous vaccine skepticism, spread lies and misinformation about people living with autism,” said Representative Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut.At the Senate hearing, Kennedy again declined to clearly support the MMR jab. “I’m not going to just tell people everything is safe and effective if I know that there’s issues,” he said.When asked whether Elon Musk had influenced his decisions, Kennedy denied taking orders but admitted Musk had assisted with fraud detection. “Elon Musk gave us help in trying and figuring out where there was fraud and abuse in the department.

Father-son duo charged with narco-terrorism, connected to Sinaloa cartel





Two top leaders of a violent faction within Mexico’s Sinaloa Cartel have been indicted on unprecedented narco-terrorism charges after allegedly trafficking massive amounts of fentanyl into the United States. Pedro Inzunza Noriega and his son, Pedro Inzunza Coronel, are now facing terrorism-related offences in a federal case unsealed on Tuesday, as announced by US attorney Adam Gordon for the Southern District of California.The pair are accused of leading “one of the largest and most sophisticated fentanyl production networks in the world,” said Gordon, who warned cartel leaders during a press briefing, “You are no longer the hunters. You are the hunted.”The indictment is the first by the department of justice’s newly formed Narco-Terrorism Unit and follows the Trump administration’s designation of the Sinaloa Cartel as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) in February, under Executive Order 14157.According to the news agency Associated Press, this is a rare move as such labels are typically reserved for politically motivated terrorist groups.The father-son duo, along with five other leaders of the Beltrán Leyva Organization (BLO), a powerful offshoot of the Sinaloa Cartel, have been charged with narco-terrorism, providing material support to terrorism, drug trafficking , and money laundering.The BLO has long been known for its brutal tactics including kidnappings, torture and murders, and operates with violent impunity across Mexico and Central America, including Tijuana.Federal officials, citing court documents, allege the Inzunzas trafficked “tens of thousands of kilograms of fentanyl” into the US.On December 3, 2024, Mexican law enforcement seized more than 1.65 tons of fentanyl from locations in Sinaloa tied to the duo, reportedly the largest fentanyl seizure globally, according to ICE.“These charges highlight the unwavering efforts of transnational criminal organizations like the Sinaloa Cartel to flood our communities with deadly drugs,” said Shawn Gibson, ICE HSI ’s San Diego special agent in charge.The case stems from “Operation Take Back America,” a nationwide DOJ initiative to dismantle cartels and transnational crime US attorney general Pamela Bondi declared, “Their days of brutalizing the American people without consequence are over, we will seek life in prison for these terrorists.”FBI San Diego’s acting special agent in charge Houtan Moshrefi added that the cartel’s activities “not only destroy lives and communities, but also threaten our national security.”Other indicted cartel leaders include Fausto Isidro Meza Flores (“Chapo Isidro”), Oscar Manuel Gastelum Iribe (“El Musico”), and Ivan Archivaldo Guzman Salazar (“El Chapito”). All remain fugitives.Pedro Inzunza Noriega, also known as “Sagitario,” reportedly operates from Los Mochis, Sinaloa, and is paralysed following a past attack by rival cartel members, as per AP.The charges carry penalties ranging from 20 years to life imprisonment, including multimillion-dollar fines. The case is being prosecuted by assistant US attorneys Joshua Mellor and Matthew Sutton.","Father-son duo charged with narco-terrorism, connected to Sinaloa cartel.

"Watch: Lawmakers Blake Moore, Debbie Dingell and Jan Schakowsky doze off during overnight committee session",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/watch-lawmakers-blake-moore-debbie-dingell-and-jan-schakowsky-doze-off-during-overnight-committee-session/articleshow/121176183.cms,"



Several lawmakers were caught nodding off during overnight committee sessions in Washington this week, as Congress scrambled to finalise key elements of President Trump’s sweeping new legislative agenda. Reps. Blake Moore of Utah, Debbie Dingell of Michigan and Jan Schakowsky of Illinois were all spotted dozing during marathon hearings that extended into the early hours.Moore, the Republican vice chair of the House GOP Conference, was filmed slumped in his chair around 5 a.m. during a House Ways and Means Committee meeting to debate the tax portion of Trump’s bill. The footage, captured by C-SPAN, showed Moore fast asleep until a colleague nudged him awake in time to vote “no” on an amendment. The moment triggered laughter among committee members and quickly spread online. Moore later joked that he needed “a quick power nap” but praised the committee’s work, saying they’d delivered a bill that would benefit American workers and families.Meanwhile, Dingell, a Democrat, was caught with her eyes shut during deliberations on a proposal to cut $900 billion in federal spending, including major reductions to Medicaid.Critics mocked her apparent fatigue, but she later explained she’d been awake for 31 hours straight, fighting against Republican efforts to slash healthcare. “Closed my eyes to think about an America where everyone has access to quality, affordable health care,” she said on social media.Schakowsky, who recently announced her retirement after 2026, was also seen nodding off during the same session. The Energy and Commerce Committee, where both she and Dingell sit, had reportedly been in session for more than 24 hours.These scenes unfolded as lawmakers wrestled with some of the most contentious elements of Trump’s legislative package, including extending the 2017 tax cuts, eliminating taxes on tips and overtime, and implementing deep social spending cuts. Divisions within the GOP, especially over the state and local tax (SALT) deduction, have made the process even more gruelling.","Reps Blake Moore of Utah, Debbie Dingell of Michigan and Jan Schakowsky of Illinois were all spotted dozing during marathon hearings.

Trump appeals for Qatar's help in persuading Iran to give up its nuclear programme,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-appeals-for-qatars-help-in-persuading-iran-to-give-up-its-nuclear-programme/articleshow/121176191.cms,"Trump appeals for Qatar's help in persuading Iran to give up its nuclear programme

Poll Do you believe that Qatar can effectively mediate between the US and Iran regarding the nuclear deal? Yes, Qatar has a strong history of mediation. No, Iran is unlikely to cooperate.





DOHA: President Donald Trump urged Qatar on Wednesday to use its influence over Iran to persuade the country's leadership to reach an agreement with the US to dial back its rapidly advancing nuclear programme. Trump, who is visiting the Gulf nation as part of a three-country Mideast swing, made the appeal during a state dinner held in his honour by Qatar's emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani.Qatar, over the years, has played the role of intermediary between the US and Iran and its proxies, including during talks with Tehran-backed Hamas as its 19-month war with Israel grinds on.""I hope you can help me with the Iran situation,"" Trump said during remarks at the formal dinner. ""It's a perilous situation, and we want to do the right thing.""Trump wants Iran to stop backing militant proxy groupsThe appeal to Qatar came after Trump told leaders at a Gulf Cooperation Council meeting earlier Wednesday in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, that he wants ""to make a deal,"" but Tehran must end its support of proxy groups throughout the Mideast as part of any potential agreement.The US and Iran brokered a nuclear deal in 2015, during Democrat Barack Obama's administration, in which Iran agreed to drastically reduce its stockpile of uranium and only enrich up to 3.67 per cent.But that deal was scrapped during the first Trump administration.Today, Iran enriches up to 60 per cent, a short, technical step from weapons-grade levels, and has enough stockpiled for multiple nuclear bombs should it choose to build them.The Qatari emir told Fox News Channel on Wednesday night that ""we agree that we want a nuclear-free region, and we cannot afford a nuclear race in that region.""But, Al Thani said, ""Iran has its right to have a nuclear - a civilian nuclear power, while not also representing any challenge or any threat for anyone in the region."" He said the issue needs to be resolved diplomatically.The US and Iran have engaged in four rounds of talks since early last month about the country's nuclear programme. Trump has said that he believes brokering a nuclear deal is possible but that the window is closing.At the state dinner, he called on Iran's leadership to ""get moving"" or risk the situation spiralling into a head-on conflict.""Because things like that get started and they get out of control,"" Trump said. ""I've seen it over and over again. They go to war and things get out of control, and we're not going to let that happen.""Trump, in his appearance at the Gulf Cooperation Council meeting in Riyadh, also said that Tehran ""must stop sponsoring terror, halt its bloody proxy wars and permanently and verifiably cease pursuit of nuclear weapons"" as conditions for any deal.The call for Iran to cease support of Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen comes as that proxy network has faced significant setbacks in the 19 months since Hamas launched its October 7, 2023, attack on Israel.In Iran, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi called Trump's remarks ""deceitful"" but did not directly address his demands.Trump said that he also believed the moment was ripe ""for a future free from the grip of Hezbollah terrorists."" Hezbollah is severely weakened after its war last year with Israel, in which much of its top leadership was killed and after losing a key ally with the fall of former Syrian President Bashar Assad, a conduit for Iran to send arms.While in Riyadh, Trump also met with Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa, a face-to-face engagement with the onetime insurgent leader who spent years imprisoned by US forces after being captured in Iraq.Al-Sharaa was named president of Syria in January, a month after a stunning offensive by insurgent groups led by al-Sharaa's Hayat Tahrir al-Sham stormed Damascus and ended the 54-year rule of the Assad family.Trump said he decided to meet with al-Sharaa after being encouraged to do so by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. He also pledged to lift yearslong sanctions on Syria.The White House billed the al-Sharaa meeting as a brief ""pull aside"" that ended up lasting 33 minutes.Trump told reporters that the meeting went ""great"" and described him as a ""young, attractive guy"" with a ""very strong past.""""He's got a real shot at holding it together,"" Trump said.Formerly known by the nom de guerre Abu Mohammed al-Golani, al-Sharaa joined the ranks of al-Qaida insurgents battling US forces in Iraq after the US -led invasion. He still faces a warrant for his arrest on terrorism charges in Iraq. The US once offered $10 million for information about his whereabouts because of his links to al-Qaida.Al-Sharaa returned to his home country of Syria after the conflict began in 2011 and led al-Qaida's branch called the Nusra Front. He changed the name of his group to Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and cut links with al-Qaida.The sanctions go back to the rule of Bashar Assad, who was ousted in December, and were intended to inflict major pain on his economy.In Qatar, Trump was greeted at the airport by Al Thani. Air Force One was escorted by Qatari F-15 jets as it neared Doha, the capital city.The emir said he had high hopes for Trump's efforts with Iran and at ending the war in Gaza.""I know that you are a man of peace,"" he said. ""I know that you want to bring peace to this region.""","Qatar has played the role of intermediary between the US and Iran and its proxies.

Thai officials seize over 200 tons of electronic waste illegally imported from the US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/thai-officials-seize-over-200-tons-of-electronic-waste-illegally-imported-from-the-us/articleshow/121175546.cms,"Thai officials seize over 200 tons of electronic waste illegally imported from the US





Thai officials said Wednesday they seized 238 tons of illegally imported electronic waste from the United States at the port of Bangkok, one of the biggest lots they've found this year.The waste, which came in 10 large containers, was declared as mixed metal scrap but turned out to be circuit boards mixed in a huge pile of metal scrap, said Theeraj Athanavanich, director-general of the Customs Department. It was found Tuesday in a random inspection.A UN report last year said electronic waste is piling up worldwide. Some 62 million tons of electronic waste was generated in 2022 and that figure is on track to reach 82 million tons by 2030, the report said. It said only 22% of the waste was properly collected and recycled in 2022 and that quantity is expected to fall to 20% by the end of the decade due to higher consumption, limited repair options, shorter product life cycles, and inadequate management infrastructure.Theeraj said Thai authorities are looking to press charges including falsely declaring imported goods, illegally importing electronic waste and planning to return the waste to its country of origin.“It’s important that we take action on this kind of goods,” he said. “There are environmental impacts that are dangerous to the people, especially communities around factories that might import these things for processing, then recycling.”Electronic waste creates huge health hazards. Many components are laden with lead and mercury, cadmium and other toxins. Recyclers are after gold, silver, palladium and copper, mainly from printed circuit boards, but lax controls mean that facilities often burn plastics to release encased copper and use unsafe methods to extract precious metals.Thailand passed a ban on the import of a range of electronic waste products in 2020. The Cabinet in February approved an expanded list of the banned waste.Sunthron Kewsawang, deputy director-general of the Department of Industrial Works, said officials suspected at least two factories in Samut Sakhon province, which borders Bangkok, are involved in importing the waste.In January, the Customs Department said it seized 256 tons of illegally imported electronic waste from Japan and Hong Kong at a port in eastern Thailand.",The waste was declared as mixed metal scrap but turned out to be circuit boards mixed in a huge pile of metal scrap.

What would lifting US sanctions on Syria mean to the war-torn country?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-would-lifting-us-sanctions-on-syria-mean-to-the-war-torn-country/articleshow/121174890.cms,"



US President Donald Trump’s move to ease sanctions on Syria could mark a turning point for the war-scarred country, potentially opening the door to long-awaited reconstruction and economic revival. The announcement came after Trump met interim Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa in Riyadh, marking the first meeting between a US leader and a Syrian head of state in 25 years. Trump praised Sharaa as a “tough guy” with a “very strong past”, a striking remark given the Syrian leader's former ties to jihadist groups and his inclusion on a US terrorism list as recently as 2013.CNN reported that Sharaa, once known as Abu Mohammed al-Jolani and leader of al-Qaeda’s affiliate in Syria, had a $10 million US bounty on his head before seizing power and expelling Iran-backed militias from Syria. His rapid rise to leadership and rebranding as a national figurehead has prompted mixed reactions globally, with some Arab nations embracing his legitimacy and others, like Israel, remaining deeply sceptical.While in Riyadh, Trump sat down with Sharaa and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, joined by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan via video link. Trump told reporters that he had encouraged Syria to join the Abraham Accords and normalise ties with Israel.Although no formal commitment was made, he said Sharaa had responded positively.Trump also said he had urged Sharaa to expel foreign militants and assume control over detention camps holding Islamic State fighters — a task currently managed by Kurdish forces backed by the US but opposed by Turkey. “They have a lot of work to do,” Trump added, noting that sanctions had left Syria in dire straits. He called the punitive measures “crippling” and said lifting them would give Syria a “strong chance” at rebuilding.The response in Syria was immediate. Celebrations broke out in major cities, with residents hoping the end of sanctions would reverse years of economic devastation. A soap factory owner in Aleppo told reporters the decision would “boost the economy and encourage people to return”.According to CNN and other experts cited, US sanctions have been in place for decades, with three main regimes: the 1979 designation of Syria as a state sponsor of terrorism, the 2003 Syria Accountability Act, and the 2019 Caesar Act. These measures have severely restricted financial transactions, humanitarian operations, and everyday commerce, pushing 90% of Syrians below the poverty line.Syrian economist Karam Shaar told CNN that the effects of lifting sanctions wouldn’t be immediate. “Sanctions aren’t a switch,” he said, cautioning that only a full rollback of overlapping restrictions would make a difference. However, even the symbolic gesture has already caused Syria’s currency to rise by 60%, signalling market optimism.Humanitarian organisations say the announcement could be transformative. “It marks a potentially transformative moment for millions of Syrians who have endured more than 13 years of economic hardship, conflict, and displacement,” said Mathieu Rouquette, Syria country director for Mercy Corps.","US President Donald Trump announced the lifting of sanctions on Syria.

NEW YORK: Colombian Sindy Estrada and her family try to stay off the streets of New York as they battle her deportation order for fear they could be detained by the authorities.Estrada and her family received a deportation order from the US government telling them to leave the country by April 30.""It has caused a nervous breakdown -- we have suffered stress, depression, anxiety, panic,"" said the businesswoman, 36, who fled Colombia three years ago after her husband's business was targeted by extortionists.N ow, US immigration officials have fitted her husband with an electronic ankle bracelet to track his whereabouts and her 16-year-old son has begun therapy amid the emotional toll of their situation.Her son ""started biting his nails and couldn't sleep, his grades dropped a lot,"" Estrada said. ""At his school they ask him what's going on -- whether he will stay or go.""""(Despite) my desire to pack a suitcase and go... I think about what would await me there. I'm afraid to return to Colombia.""Estrada and her family, who live in New Jersey, are among the millions of undocumented migrants in the United States fearful of President Donald Trump 's onslaught against non-citizens.Experts say his crackdown has exerted a psychological toll akin to the September 11, 2001 attacks that claimed almost 3,000 lives.Trump has vowed to undertake the largest mass deportation of undocumented migrants, who number around 11 million, in US history.He denounces people who entered the country illegally, visa overstayers, or those with legal temporary residence permits while they pursue options like asylum, describing them as ""criminals"" who must be returned at all costs.Trump has been accused of unlawful deportations without due process to a maximum security counterterrorism prison in El Salvador while also scrapping the longstanding policy of US citizenship through birth and seeking to block migrants challenging their detention.In the past week the Republican offered a $1,000 payout to undocumented migrants who leave voluntarily.Although the shock troops of Trump's crackdown, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, insist they target undocumented criminals, US media reports few arrestees fall into that category.The presence of ICE agents in migrant neighborhoods or on subway routes used by immigrants, particularly Hispanics, has sown fear.The ""uncertainty, fear, anguish"" experienced by migrants ""is similar to what was endured during the September 11 attacks"" of 2001, said New York City Department of Health Services mental health consultant Juan Carlos Dumas.The mental health crisis has led to increased alcohol and drug abuse, as well as family conflict, the Argentine psychotherapist, 68, told AFP.""The anguish has to go somewhere,"" he said.Self-harming among young people has increased, just as it did after 9/11, he said.Youths ""exorcise their feelings through aggression,"" Dumas said at the gate of a school in Harlem where he works to detect such issues among pupils.""They each try to deal with the fear in their own way,"" he said. ""We haven't seen anything like this for years.""Migrants who have been in the country for many years and built a life are affected the most.The prospect of having to leave it is ""totally traumatizing,"" he said, recommending that no one should feel the need to stay indoors.Dumas said that New York, a sanctuary city where local police do not cooperate with ICE to deport people, has a range of mental health services including social workers, psychologists and therapists for those in need.""Not everyone has it in for migrants,"" he said.","Sindy Estrada and her family received a deportation order from the US government.

Trump-era ""border czar"" Tom Homan has lashed out at Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , saying he wishes she would “do her job” after she downplayed questions about a potential Justice Department probe into her role in a controversial webinar advising migrants on dealing with ICE agents.“She’s a legislator, right?

Homan previously suggested that her actions particularly advising people not to open their doors to ICE could constitute obstruction.Homan appeared on Capitol Hill this week at the invitation of Rep. August Pfluger, R-Texas, to brief House Republicans on border security . When asked whether Democrats who recently joined protests outside a Newark ICE facility including Reps.

A federal judge on Wednesday ordered that a Georgetown scholar from India be released from immigration detention after he was detained in the Trump administration’s crackdown on foreign college students. Badar Khan Suri , who is being held in Texas, will go home to his family in Virginia while he awaits the outcome of his petition against the Trump administration for wrongful arrest and detention in violation of the First Amendment and other constitutional rights.He’s also facing deportation proceedings in an immigration court in Texas. Before ordering his release, district judge Patricia Tolliver Giles in Alexandria said she was releasing him because she felt Suri had substantial constitutional claims against the Trump administration.She also considered the needs of his family and said she didn’t believe he was a danger to the community. The Trump govt had said his visa was revoked because of his online posts and his wife’s connection to Gaza as a Palestinian American. They accused him of supporting Hamas. Mapheze Saleh, Suri’s wife, is the daughter of Ahmed Yousef, a former adviser to Ismail Haniyeh, the Hamas member whom Israel assassinated last year in Iran.“Speech regarding the conflict there and opposing Israel’s military campaign is likely protected political speech,” Giles said. “And thus he was likely engaging in protected speech.” She added: “The First Amendment does not distinguish between citizens and noncitizens” Suri was arrested by masked, plain-clothed officers on the evening of March 17 outside his apartment complex in Virginia.By the time a petition had been filed to keep his case in Virginia, authorities had put him on a plane to Louisiana without allowing him to update his family or lawyer, Suri’s attorneys said. A few days later, he was moved again to Texas. Before Wednesday’s hearing, US attorneys argued that Suri’s case should be moved from Virginia to Texas because the petition was filed after the scholar had already left the state.They said filing his case in Texas is a “relatively straightforward application of wellsettled law”. Giles agreed with Suri’s attorneys from American Civil Liberties Union, who argued that it had appeared the real reason he was moved to Texas was to bring the case before a more conservative court. Khan Suricame to the US in 2022 through a J-1 visa, working at Georgetown as a visiting scholar and postdoctoral fellow.He has three children: a 9-yearold son and 5-year-old twins. Before his arrest, he taught a course on majority and minority human rights in South Asia. Court filings said he hoped to become a professor and embark on a career in academia.A federal grand jury indicted a Wisconsin judge on charges she helped a man in the country illegally evade US immigration authorities looking to arrest him as he appeared before her in a local domestic abuse case. Milwaukee county circuit judge Hannah Dugan’s arrest and ensuing indictment has escalated a clash between Trump govt and local authorities over the Republican president’s sweeping immigration crackdown. Dugan faces up to six years in prison if convicted. Her team of defence attorneys said that she maintains her innocence and looks forward to being vindicated in court. Dugan is scheduled to enter a plea on Thursday.A federal judge on Tuesday opened a path for Trump govt to move forward with deporting a Venezuelan man under Alien Enemies Act, a wartime law, but ruled it must first give him notice in his native language, 21 days to object and an “opportunity to be heard” in court. The ruling, by judge Stephanie L Haines from the western district of Pennsylvania, could provide a legal opening for govt to restart deportations under the Act of Venezuelans whom it considers members of Tren de Aragua, a gang that the White House has designated as a terrorist organisation. The American Civil Liberties Unionsaid it would appeal Haines’ decision.","Badar Khan Suri will go home to his family in Virginia while he awaits the outcome of his petition against the Trump administration for wrongful arrest and detention.

Pakistan envoy honeytrapped in Bangladesh? Sudden exit after viral videos sparks row,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-envoy-honeytrapped-in-bangladesh-sudden-exit-after-viral-videos-sparks-row/articleshow/121164452.cms,"



Pakistan’s high commissioner to Bangladesh, Syed Ahmed Maroof , has abruptly gone on leave after videos of his alleged honeytrap surfaced online, according to Bangladeshi daily Prothom Alo.Maroof left Dhaka on the morning of 11 May, travelling to Islamabad via Dubai. That same day, the Pakistan high commission in Dhaka formally notified Bangladesh’s ministry of foreign affairs of his departure, a senior ministry official told Prothom Alo on Tuesday.Diplomatic sources in Dhaka suggest that Maroof’s recall may be linked to controversy surrounding a personal visit to Cox’s Bazar during the recent India-Pakistan conflict, and his alleged association with a female Bangladeshi government official, Daily Sun reported.Under diplomatic protocol, when an ambassador takes leave, the host country’s foreign ministry is informed of the duration and who will assume responsibilities in the interim. While the Pakistan high commission confirmed that deputy high commissioner Muhammad Asif will serve as acting high commissioner, no timeframe for Maroof’s leave was provided in official communication, Prothom Alo noted.Maroof had played a high-profile role in Dhaka and Islamabad ties, particularly following the ousting of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s government on 5 August 2024, in the wake of a student-led uprising.Rumours of the scandal escalated after photos and alleged intimate videos surfaced online, showing Maroof with a Bangladeshi woman. This also led to speculation that the envoy had been honey-trapped.","Pakistan’s high commissioner to Bangladesh, Syed Ahmed Maroof, has abruptly gone on leave after videos of his alleged honeytrap surfaced online.

NEW DELHI: Early in March, the US arrested in Afghanistan an ISIS-K operative involved in the 2021 Abbey Gate bombing that killed 13 Marines. President Donald Trump was quick to thank Pakistan for its help in nabbing the high-value fugitive from the Pak-Afghan border. ""I want to thank the government of Pakistan for helping arrest this monster,"" he told US Congress.But what was brushed under the carpet was an open secret in intelligence circles: The operative, Sharifullah, had been in Pakistan spy agency ISI's custody for over a year. ISI ran multiple operations using his network and ultimately handed him over to the CIA at the right time - when the regime changed in Washington.This was not the first instance of Pakistan trying to please the US by handing over terrorists that it had been using to achieve its own goals. ISI had played the same trick in 2010 when it 'suddenly discovered' Taliban military commander Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar and handed him over to CIA.The case of Osama bin Laden and his courier, Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti, further exposed the duplicity of Pakistan and its military-industrial complex. Pakistani intelligence agencies had claimed they had no knowledge of Osama's presence in Abbottabad despite the compound where he was staying being just about a kilometre away from the Pakistan Military Academy.The Americans, it appears, didn't believe the Pakistanis and kept on hunting for the 9/11 plotter.But while his capture and killing vindicated the US's lack of trust in Islamabad, American leaders continued to allow themselves to be baited by the Pakistanis. Trump, who considers himself to be the greatest deal maker, seems to be the latest victim of Pakistan's dual game, feeling beholden to the favour that ISI did by offering Sharifullah as a trophy.Sharifullah and Osama are not standalone cases. In 2002, a bombing at nightclubs in Bali had left over 200 people dead, including several Americans. The prime suspect was Umar Patek, a suspected member of the militant group Jemaah Islamiyah. The US had announced a $1 million bounty on him.On January 25, 2011, Patek was dramatically captured by Pakistani officials in Abbottabad and handed over to the US, which then passed him on to Indonesia as a gesture which ""demonstrated the international cooperation between the US and Indonesia in addressing terrorism"". Pakistan had similarly arrested Osama's man Friday Abu Zubaydah in Faisalabad six months after the 9/11 attacks. He was swiftly transferred to CIA custody.These capture-extraditions, though seen as attempts by Pakistan to demonstrate its commitment to counter-terrorism, have actually been selective and strategic, aimed at appeasing the US rather than genuinely combating terrorism, a senior officer said.","US arrested in Afghanistan an ISIS-K operative involved in the 2021 Abbey Gate bombing that killed 13 Marines.

NEW DELHI: India’s decisive military action under Operation Sindoor resulted in 11 Pakistani military personnel killed and 78 injured, Pakistan confirmed on Tuesday.The casualties occurred during India’s major counterterrorism strike in a strong retaliatory action of Pahalgam terroar attack codenamed, Operation Sindoor, launched on May 7. As part of the offensive, Indian armed forces carried out precision strikes on nine terror launchpads, including major hubs of Jaish-e-Mohammad in Bahawalpur and Lashkar-e-Taiba in Muridke.In retaliation, Pakistan launched a series of drone incursions into Indian airspace over subsequent nights. These drones were in a quick response were intercepted and neutralised by India's air defence systems.After Pak's incursion, India escalated its response, targeting and reportedly destroying key Pakistani military and air infrastructure, including the Nur Khan Airbase in Rawalpindi and the Rahim Yar Khan airbase.Although both countries reached an understanding to end hostilities on Saturday, an initiative that reportedly came from Islamabad, the ceasefire was short-lived. Pakistan violated the agreement within hours of talks between the Director Generals of Military Operations (DGMOs) from both sides.The Pakistan military released names of several personnel killed in the strikes. Among the Pakistan air force casualties were Squadron Leader Usman Yousuf, Chief Technician Aurangzeb, Senior Technician Najeeb, Corporal Technician Farooq, and Senior Technician Mubashir.Pakistan army fatalities included Naik Abdul Rehman, Lance Naik Dilawar Khan, Lance Naik Ikramullah, Naik Waqar Khalid, Sepoy Muhammad Adeel Akbar, and Sepoy Nisar.","India's decisive military action under Operation Sindoor resulted in 11 Pakistani military personnel killed and 78 injured, Pakistan confirmed on Tuesday.

Pakistan’s misinformation campaign was exposed yet again after its claim that the man leading funeral prayers for terrorists was an innocent preacher turned out to be blatant lie and the man in question was identified as a designated global terrorist During a press conference, Pakistan’s DG-ISPR (Director General of Inter-Services Public Relations) had flashed the national ID card of a man with a similar name, Abdul Rauf, claiming that he was a preacher and a member of the Pakistan Markazi Muslim League (PMML) party.However, details from the same bio-data exposed the intricate web of misinformation spun by the ISI. It turned out that Abdul Rauf was not a preacher or Masood Azhar’s slain brother with the same name but a different individual with ties to Lashkar-eTaiba. The man, Hafiz Abdul Rauf , is a ‘specially designated global terrorist’ (SDGT) by the US department of treasury and is also on the SDN (Specially Designated Nationals) list of the US government.Pakistan’s lies were busted from their computerised national identity card (CNIC) number visible in the document flashed by DG ISPR Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif. The number 35202-5400413-9 on the document is the same as the one listed by the US treasury and the Office of Foreign Assets Control which incidentally also lists Lt Gen Sharif’s father, Mahmood Sultan Bashiruddin, as a designated terrorist with ties to al-Qaida.In the press conference held by DG ISPR during Operation Sidoor, a Pakistan Air Force officer also claimed to have shown “tactical brilliance” in Pulwama, which is being interpreted as an acknowledgement of the Pakistani military’s role in the 2019 Pulwama terror attack that killed 40 CRPF personnel.They then went on to allege that India’s claims of Abdul Rauf being a terrorist were not true.Incidentally, the same photograph of Abdul Rauf at the burial was used by India to identify and release the names of senior Pakistan army personnel and key police officials who attended the funeral of terrorists — including high-ranking officers such as Lt Gen Fayyaz Hussain Shah and Inspector General of Police Usman Anwar.According to the US treasury department, Hafiz Abdul Rauf, a member of LeT’s senior leadership since 1999, is the chief of Falah-i-Insaniat Foundation, operating LeT’s relief activities in disguise.","Pakistan had claimed that the man leading the prayers was Abdul Rauf, a preacher and member of Pakistan Markazi Muslim League.

The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) has declared that a ""new order has become inevitable"" in south Asia, warning of a regional shift. The BLA claims to have carried out 71 strikes at 51 locations targeting Pak army personnel and posts in the last few days, asserting its role as a ""dynamic and decisive party"" in the region's future, while rejecting claims of being a foreign proxy.In a statement issued on Sunday, the BLA said that the attacks were carried out as part of its ' Operation Herof '. These operations, it said, targeted military convoys, checkpoints, intelligence centers, and infrastructure, aiming to challenge Pakistan 's control and demonstrate the group's territorial reach.Key strikes occurred in Kech, Panjgur, Mastung, Quetta, and Nushki - ranging from ambushes and IED blasts to targeted killings and the seizure of security posts, it added.In a strongly worded statement, the BLA also warned of escalating conflict and instability in the region, accusing Pakistan of terrorism and human rights abuses in Balochistan The BLA also rejected claims that it was a proxy of any state or power, asserting its independence and resolve to continue its armed struggle for independence. ""The BLA is neither a pawn nor a silent spectator; we are a dynamic and decisive party,"" the party's spokesperson Jeeyand Baloch said.The BLA called on India and international community to recognise Pakistan as a terrorist state and take decisive action against it, warning that failure to do so would lead to further bloodshed and instability.

Chinese military on Monday addressed the reports claiming that it sent its largest military cargo plane with arms supplies to Pakistan during its offensive against India last week. The People's Liberation Army Air Force called it a ""rumour"" and warned of legal action against those behind this.In a statement published on the official website of the Chinese defence ministry, the Air Force clarified that no such mission had taken place, countering the speculation circulating across various internet platforms about China's ""Y-20 transporting relief supplies to Pakistan"".""The internet is not beyond the law! Those who produce and spread military-related rumours will be held legally responsible!"" the report added.This came after Beijing rejected claims by Pakistan that it used Chinese fighter jets against India during Operation Sindoor . It had also stressed upon its anti-terrorism stance saying, ""China opposes all forms of terrorism. We urge both sides to act in the larger interest of peace and stability, remain calm, exercise restraint, and refrain from taking actions that may further complicate the situation.""The reports of China helping Pakistan received fuel after it expressed support for its ""all-weather friend"" during Operation Sindoor.Meanwhile, China has become the primary arms supplier to Pakistan, accounting for a staggering 81% of Islamabad’s total weapons imports between 2020 and 2024, according to a new report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).Operation Sindoor, launched in response to Pahalgam terror attack that claimed the lives of 25 Indian nationals and one Nepalese citizen, has seen the Indian Armed Forces carry out a series of precision strikes deep inside Pakistan.According to official statements, nine terror camps across Pakistan were targeted during the midnight operation, as part of a broader retaliation aimed at dismantling infrastructure supporting cross-border terrorism.","Chinese military denies sending arms to Pakistan during Operation Sindoor.

Yields under threat

Seeping salt



Resistant varieties







Katukurunda: A commando in an elite Sri Lankan police unit, Sameera Dilshan has an unusual mission, to reclaim farms poisoned by salt, a long-standing problem now accelerating due to climate change.Increasing salinity is slowly and steadily swallowing traditional rice paddies along the island's coastline, taking away the livelihood of generations of farmers.Two hours' drive south of the capital Colombo lies Katukurunda, one of the camps of the formidable Special Task Force (STF), created four decades ago to fight Tamil rebels.While his colleagues train for riot control under the humid heat of the nearby Indian Ocean, the 35-year-old non-commissioned officer and his ""commando-farmer"" team are hoeing, weeding and watering.Their goal? To grow coconut palms and a wide variety of fruits and vegetables in a paddy declared dead 40 years ago due to salt water contamination.""This plantation was launched in 2022 as part of a government initiative to improve food security,"" Dilshan said, with local authorities allocating land parcels.The method, known as sorjan, is similar to techniques used in Thailand and Indonesia.It reshapes flood-prone land by digging ponds where rice can be grown or fish raised, with more saline-tolerant coconut trees planted.Embankments around these ponds are used for more delicate crops.""We're tending to 360 coconut trees planted here... along with pumpkins, gourds and cucumbers,"" Dilshan said. ""In two and a half years, we'll know if it's a success or not.""""It's an efficient and climate-resilient production system that optimises land use and productivity, and increases farmers' profits,"" said Buddhi Marambe, from the University of Peradeniya.The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said in a 2024 report that saltwater from seas and oceans affects 10.7 percent of the Earth's land, making it uncultivable in some cases.It travels up rivers with the tides, seeps into soil through evaporation, and contaminates groundwater used for irrigation.Climate change, which dries out the soil, reduces water resources, or raises sea levels, is expected to increase the proportion of such ""salty"" land from 24 percent to 32 percent of the world's surface area by the end of the century, the FAO predicts.These trends ""threaten agricultural productivity and reduce crop yields in affected zones"", it warns.Sri Lanka is no exception.Marambe estimates that 223,000 hectares (551,000 acres), half of which are rice paddies, are impacted by salinity -- nearly eight percent of the country's total arable land.South of the pilot plantation lies the village of Parappuwa, surrounded by abandoned land.Here, just a few kilometres from the sea, only a few small areas of the paddy fields are still in use.""Everything is polluted by salt that comes up during high tide,"" said Gamini Piyal Wijesinghe, 46, a farmer's son who, after he left the army, went into the restaurant business instead.He pointed to a stream where 18 small dams were built to stop the seawater.""They weren't constructed properly,"" he said. ""The water seeps through.""Other former rice farmers have turned to cinnamon or rubber cultivation.""Cinnamon is doing fairly well, but our income has significantly dropped since we stopped growing rice,"" said W.D. Jayaratne, 50, head of the local farmers' association.The future is gloomy.""Salinity in the water is increasing and threatening our farmland,"" he added. ""There are also insects. Everywhere you look, there are problems.""In this district of Kalutara, local authorities are offering abandoned land to farmers to bring it back under cultivation, mostly with coconut trees.""We've already allocated 400 hectares and plan to increase that to 1,000 in the next two years,"" said district chief Janaka Gunawardana.""There's high demand for coconut. It will create income for our people.""In Katukurunda, Aruna Priyankara Perera, 55, was encouraged by the success of the STF farming experiment.""I got five acres (two hectares) next to my hotel to replicate the STF's project,"" he said in front of his freshly planted coconut and pumpkin field.""The land is free for two years, provided you can show it's being cultivated.""Rice, the local staple, is a top concern for the authorities.""Soil salinity is a major issue in Sri Lanka,"" Marambe said. ""We've successfully tested several promising rice varieties that are resistant to salinity and flooding.""The stakes are high.A recent study of the Bentota river estuary, in the island's southwest, found that half of local rice farmers had lost all their income due to saltwater contamination.Even more serious, Sri Lanka's food security is now under threat. The last rice harvest, from September to March, was the country's lowest since 2019.""If we don't all roll up our sleeves to bring salt-polluted land back into cultivation and production,"" Marambe said, ""the future will only get darker.""",Sri Lankan commando-farmer team aims to reclaim rice paddies poisoned by salt.

Funerals have been held in Myanmar for almost two dozen students and teachers alleged to have been killed in an airstrike on a local school by a ruling military jet fighter.Local resistance groups and independent media said Tuesday that 20 pupils and 2 teachers died in the attack on Ohe Htein Twin village, in Sagaing region's township of Tabayin, also known as Depayin. Their reports said that as many as 100 people were wounded.The dead students were from grades 2 to 11, with the youngest seven years old, according to the shadow National Unity Government, which serves as an umbrella organization for opponents of military ruleA member of a local resistance group fighting against army rule told The Associated Press that another student, who was severely injured in Monday's bombing, died Tuesday afternoon while undergoing medical treatment.The resistance fighter, who requested that neither he nor his group be named for fear of arrest by the military, said the incident occurred while more than 100 students were studying in a school in the village, which has about 500 houses. He denied that any resistance fighters were stationed in the village that was attacked.Sagaing has been a stronghold of armed resistance to army rule in Myanmar, and the military in recent years has stepped up airstrikes in their fight against resistance forces, which include the armed People's Defense Forces.The resistance has no effective defense against air attacks, which many reports say hit non-military targets.Myanmar has been in turmoil since the army's 2021 takeover ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, which led to nationwide peaceful protests that escalated into a durable armed resistance denying the army control of much of the country.A report Tuesday in the state-run Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper denied the army had carried out the airstrike, saying malicious media outlets were intentionally spreading fake information. The military's tight control over the media and the relative remoteness of many such incidents makes independent confirmation of what occurred difficult.The bodies of 18 of the victims, most of them under the age of 10 were buried Monday in two village cemeteries after hastily arranged funerals just a few hours after the bombing incident, the unidentified resistance fighter said.About 100 wounded people, both students and teachers, were being treated in regional hospitals as the village's clinic lacked adequate facilities. At least two victims have had to have limbs amputated, he added.A member of another resistance group, the White Depeyin People's Defence Force, also speaking on condition of anonymity, told the AP that the funerals concluded on Tuesday.A report on Tuesday by the human rights ministry of the national unity government said the jet fighter took off from an airbase in Meiktila township in the central region of Mandalay on Monday morning and deliberately attacked the school with two cluster bombs while students were preparing to sit for their exams.""All individuals implicated in the commanding, execution, or collusion of deliberate air strikes against innocent children, students, and educators shall be subject to stringent judicial repercussions,"" the group said in a separate statement. ""No avenue for impunity shall be permitted. Every responsible party will be pursued without respite, unequivocally identified, held accountable and subjected to stringent punitive measures under the full force of the law. ""The military has increasingly used airstrikes to counter the widespread armed struggle against its rule. More than 6,600 civilians are estimated to have been killed by security forces since the army's 2021 takeover, according to figures compiled by nongovernmental organizations.Airstrikes in Myanmar garnered increased attention recently when numerous reports deemed credible by the United Nations and human rights groups said that they continued to be carried out in the wake of Myanmar's devastating March 28 earthquake, after which the military and resistance groups declared ceasefires to facilitate relief efforts.""We are horrified by reports of a Myanmar regime airstrike on a school in an earthquake-affected area at a time when a ceasefire has been announced. Schools are meant to be a place of safety and opportunity, not collateral in a conflict,"" Britain's minister for Indo-Pacific catherine west said in a statement.""We repeat our call to all parties, particularly the Myanmar military, to refrain from airstrikes, safeguard civilians, and protect civilian infrastructure.""","Local resistance groups and independent media said 20 pupils and 2 teachers died in the attack.

Myanmar's ex-ambassador to London has been charged with trespass for refusing to leave his ambassadorial residence, police said Wednesday, after he was stripped of his post by the military junta following a 2021 coup. Kyaw Zwar Minn , 66, faces a charge of diplomatic trespass and will appear before a court on May 30, London's Metropolitan Police said.The case comes after diplomats close to the junta in April 2021 seized the embassy in central London. They refused access to Minn, a supporter of Aung San Suu Kyi's civilian government overthrown by a coup in February that year.Britain's Conservative government at the time indicated it would offer its protection to the ousted ambassador.The then British foreign minister, Dominic Raab, condemned ""the bullying actions of the Myanmar military regime in London"" and paid tribute to Kyaw Zwar Minn for his ""courage"".Minn's lawyer said after his client was questioned by police in 2023 that the residence remained the property of the Union of Myanmar.""My client has always maintained that he is more than happy to hand over the keys to a representative of the democratically elected government of Myanmar,"" he added.The 2021 coup plunged Myanmar into a conflict that has forced more than a million people to flee their homes, according to the United Nations, with thousands more arrested.Myanmar's relations with the United Kingdom, the former colonial power, have deteriorated sharply since the military seized power.It was not immediately clear if Minn was still living at the residence.","Myanmar's ex-ambassador to London charged with trespass for refusing to leave residence.

Yes, transparency is important No, it's a private matter





DHAKA: Pakistan's high commissioner to Bangladesh, Syed Ahmed Maroof , who has been notably active since the fall of the Sheikh Hasina govt, has taken sudden leave and departed Dhaka, prompting a wave of speculation in diplomatic circles and on social media.Maroof left Dhaka on May 11, travelling back to Islamabad via Dubai. On the same day, the Pakistan high commission in Dhaka officially notified Bangladesh's ministry of foreign affairs of his departure. A spokesperson for the embassy said the envoy is in Pakistan for ""consultations"" but did not elaborate further. The commission said deputy high commissioner Muhammad Asif will serve as acting high commissioner . However, it has not disclosed the expected length of Maroof's leave in its formal communication.Maroof had played a prominent role in organising high-level visits, including that of Pakistan's foreign secretary, and has travelled extensively across Bangladesh, with his most recent visit to Cox's Bazar on May 9. Given his high-profile role, Maroof's abrupt departure has fuelled speculation about the reasons behind his leave. Some observers have questioned whether it reflects a shift in Pakistan's diplomatic strategy or relates to recent regional developments. Maroof assumed his post in Dec 2023.","Pakistan's high commissioner to Bangladesh, Syed Ahmed Maroof, has taken sudden leave. Maroof left Dhaka on May 11, travelling back to Islamabad via Dubai.

Nine months after the dramatic toppling of the Sheikh Hasina government in a student-led uprising , former Bangladesh President Abdul Hamid has quietly fled the country, reportedly donning a lungi and wheeled through the airport in a wheelchair in the dead of night.According to Dhaka Post, Hamid boarded a Thai Airways flight at 3:05 am Thursday, accompanied by his wife, brother, and brother-in-law. The image of the once-powerful President leaving in a humble lungi has gone viral, captured by a security camera and now emblematic of the fall of the Awami League.Hamid, who served two terms as President, is reportedly facing a murder charge. But unlike many top Awami League leaders who were arrested at airports or while crossing borders, he appears to have been allowed to leave the country unimpeded.“According to Articles 34 and 102 of the Constitution, no Bangladeshi citizen can be prevented from travelling unless there is a specific ban from the court. We have not received any instructions to ban him. There was no request or application from the police to detain or arrest him in any case,” an airport official told Dhaka Post.Since Sheikh Hasina fled to India following the August 5 uprising, several senior Awami League figures have either been jailed or disappeared. The new interim government is being led by Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus Hamid has not been seen in public since the transition.Meanwhile, a political counter-wave is building. Former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia returned to Dhaka last week after medical treatment in London. Her return turned into a massive street rally as thousands of BNP supporters lined the roads from the airport to her residence in Gulshan. She was accompanied by her daughters-in-law and flown home on a special plane sent by Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani.Zia’s son Tarique Rahman, who has been living in London for 17 years due to numerous cases filed during Hasina's rule, now leads the BNP from abroad.","Abdul Hamid left the country on Thursday, nine months after the ouster of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.

Poll Do you support the interim government's decision to ban Awami League activities? Yes, it is necessary for political stability. No, it undermines democracy.





DHAKA: Bangladesh's interim govt took the unprecedented step of issuing a gazette notification banning all activities of Awami League - the country's oldest political party - and its affiliated outfits, in a move critics say reflects a deepening political crisis following the ouster of longtime PM Sheikh Hasina. The ban, enforced under a hastily amended Anti-Terrorism Act, marks a dramatic escalation in the Muhuammad Yunus-led govt's efforts to reshape the post-Hasina political landscape.The home ministry invoked Section 18 of the new Act to impose the ban, citing ""reasonable grounds"" that the party and its affiliates were involved in terrorism.The revised law permits govt to declare any 'entity' - not just individuals - as terrorist if sufficient grounds exist. According to the gazette, the ban will remain in effect until International Crimes Tribunal of Bangladesh completes the trials of Awami League members and activists accused of crimes against humanity during last year's anti-govt protests, which led to the ousting of Hasina on Aug 5, ending her 16-year rule.On Saturday, the interim govt announced the prohibition of all Awami League activities, including online engagement, press statements, and public gatherings.The following night, President Mohammed Shahabuddin promulgated an ordinance reinforcing the law by banning all forms of publicity or expression of support for individuals or entities charged under Section 18(1). Awami League has rejected govt's decision and vowed to continue its political activities ""in an appropriate manner"".The ban will be there until ICT completes the trial of the party and its leaders.Meanwhile, Gono Odhikar Parishad, a political party, has urged Election Commission to cancel the registration of Awami League and other members of the 14-party alliance, including Jatiya Party. However, the CEC, AMM Nasir Uddin, said, ""Let the official notification come first. We are waiting for the gazette.""",Ban marks escalation in govt bid to reshape post-Hasina political landscape.

The Taliban has banned chess in Afghanistan , citing religious concerns, in yet another move to curb entertainment and sports in the country, Khaama Press reported.The decision was announced by the Taliban's ministry of promotion of virtue and prevention of vice, which claimed that chess is ""haram"" (forbidden) under its interpretation of Islamic law. The Afghanistan Chess Federation has also been dissolved as part of the ban.Taliban officials from the ministry of sports confirmed on May 11 that all chess-related activities have been suspended indefinitely. They said that the sport would remain banned until religious concerns are addressed.This development comes amid growing restrictions by the Taliban on cultural, social, and sporting events since their return to power in 2021. Prior to the ban, Afghan chess players had reportedly appealed for support and permission to continue playing, but their requests were rejected.Chess had been experiencing a revival in Afghanistan in recent years, with the national federation previously functioning under the Taliban-led ministry of sports.","The Taliban has banned chess in Afghanistan, citing religious concerns.

Poll Should Prime Minister Keir Starmer prioritize stronger relations with the EU despite domestic pressures? Yes, he should be bolder. No, he should focus on domestic issues.

Left-wing vote:





Prime Minister Keir Starmer is treading a fine line on UK-EU relations as hard-right populists make gains at a time when Brexit and immigration remain toxic issues in Britain.The Labour leader will host European Union chiefs in London on Monday for a major summit designed to progress a deeper relationship between the UK and the bloc than the one negotiated by the previous Conservative government.But Starmer will be wary of giving ammunition to arch-Eurosceptic Nigel Farage's Reform UK party , while also conscious that US President Donald Trump views the EU negatively.""He's walking two tightropes at the same time,"" said British foreign policy expert Richard Whitman, describing immigration as a ""salient"" issue in the UK and Trump's attitude to the EU as ""hostile"".""Starmer is balancing this big international issue and also the domestic politics one, and that's what makes it so tricky for the prime minister,"" the politics professor told AFP.The anti-immigration Reform was founded in 2018 -- two years after Britons voted to leave the EU -- as the Brexit Party, with the aim of advocating for Britain to depart the bloc without a withdrawal agreement.Renamed the Reform UK Party in 2021, it has gained significant ground.Last month, it won more than 670 local council seats, its first two mayoral posts, and gained an additional parliamentary MP in local English elections.Farage's upstarts are also leading national opinion polls as they tap into concerns about net migration, which stood at 728,000 in the 12 months to last June, and the struggling economy.Starmer hopes closer relations with the bloc can spur his main ambition of economic growth but he has vowed to honour the Brexit result, not rejoin the single market, customs union or return to free movement of people.He has been publicly reticent about an EU-proposed youth mobility scheme that would allow British and European 18- to 30-year-olds to study and work in the UK and vice versa, although the UK government has made warmer noises in recent weeks about a possible controlled programme.An announcement seems unlikely on Monday given that it comes just a week after Starmer said he wanted to ""significantly"" reduce immigration in a speech intended to appeal to potential Reform voters.""To announce something like that would be a bit perilous politically,"" said Whitman, deputy director of the Global Europe Centre at the University of Kent.Starmer and EU bosses Ursula von der Leyen and Antonio Costa are instead expected to seal a defence pact at the summit -- a deal seen as the lowest hanging fruit for negotiators.""There's nothing in his proposals that is a dial-shifter in terms of economic growth,"" said Anand Menon, director of the UK in a Changing Europe think-tank.While Starmer is squeezed on the right, he is also under pressure from pro-European lawmakers within Labour who want him to get closer to the EU.""We must not let Brexit hold us back from our national interest,"" Stella Creasy, chair of the Labour Movement for Europe group, told AFP.""Both sides must move on from the disagreements and red lines to seeking to reduce the paperwork and red tape we face as a result.""A poll for the internationalist think-tank Best for Britain last month found that 53 per cent of voters believe a closer relationship with the EU would be positive for the UK economy.Britain's traditional third party, the Liberal Democrats, wants to rejoin the single market and is also surging in popularity, as are the left-wing Greens as UK politics fractures.""I think Labour are underplaying the danger of losing votes to their left,"" said Menon.He thinks Starmer -- who voted to remain at the 2016 referendum -- can afford to be bolder considering his 156-majority in parliament and the fact that Reform only has five out of 650 MPs.""Everything is done in a sort of defensive crouch,"" Menon said of the prime minister's approach.""It's kind of apologetic, rather than, 'This is what I think is good for the country, this is why I'm doing it'.""I would advise him to start winning the argument.""",Prime Minister Keir Starmer is treading a fine line on UK-EU relations as hard- right populists make gains.

In a move to ease the pressure on Britain’s overflowing jails, justice secretary Shabana Mahmood has announced emergency measures allowing recalled prisoners to be released after just 28 days.This step is expected to free up 1,400 prison places, reports the Independent.Speaking on Wednesday, Mahmood warned that the prison system is at a crisis point, with jails now 99 per cent full and on course to completely run out of space within five months. “If our prisons overflow, courts cancel trials, police halt their arrests, crime goes unpunished and we reach a total breakdown of law and order,” she said.The emergency scheme will apply to offenders serving one to four-year sentences who are recalled for breaching their licence terms. However, those recalled for serious further offences , including certain sexual and violent crimes and serious domestic abuse, will be excluded.While announcing the early release plan, Mahmood also revealed £4.7 billion in Treasury funding for a ""record prison expansion"". This will support three new facilities. Existing prisons will also see additional cells added.However, Mahmood admitted that “we cannot build our way out of this crisis”, warning that the population is increasing by around 3,000 each year, enough to fill two prisons annually.Despite already releasing more than 16,000 inmates after just 40 per cent of their sentences, Mahmood said further action was essential to “buy us the time we need”.Amy Rees, the Ministry of Justice’s interim permanent secretary, said running prisons nearly full is dangerous. It causes more violence, less time for education and work, and forces the system to use emergency plans. Rees warned that the justice system could break down. Police might not be able to arrest people, and courts could be forced to let dangerous offenders go on bail.","Shabana Mahmood announces emergency measures to ease pressure on jails.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer told lawmakers Wednesday that recent arson attacks on properties linked to him represent ""an attack on all of us, on democracy and the values that we stand for.""The remarks by Starmer during weekly prime minister's questions were his first since the fires came to light earlier this week.The attacks were condemned by leaders across the House of Commons , including the Conservative Party's Kemi Badenoch, who described them as ""completely unacceptable.""On Tuesday, London's Metropolitan Police arrested a 21-year-old man in southeast London on suspicion of starting fires at Starmer's private house, another property and a car connected to the politician. No injuries were reported from any of the fires.In a statement Wednesday, police said they have been granted a further 36 hours to question the man, who is being held at a London police station. That means he can be questioned until Friday morning.Police said the suspect was detained on suspicion of arson with intent to endanger life after an early morning fire Monday damaged the door of the house in Kentish Town, north London, where Starmer and his family lived before he was elected to lead the country last July. Starmer moved with his family to the prime minister's official Downing Street residence after taking office.Counterterrorism detectives, who are leading the investigation because it involves the prime minister, are also looking into connections between a car fire Thursday near Starmer's house and another fire Sunday outside a house nearby that has been converted into apartments and which he has a connection to.Authorities are investigating whether there was state involvement as well as looking at other potential motivations.""A key line of enquiry is whether the fires are linked due to the two premises and the vehicle all having previous links to the same high-profile public figure,"" said Cmdr Dominic Murphy, head of counterterrorism at the Metropolitan Police.Starmer's former house has attracted protesters in the past. Last year, three pro-Palestinian activists were arrested and charged with public order offenses after unfurling a banner covered in red handprints outside the building.","Prime Minister Keir Starmer condemns ""attack on our democracy"" after fires at homes linked to him.

Poll What do you think is the most important factor in dealing with cases of abuse? Immediate legal action Victim support and counseling





A woman in the United Kingdom recalled her harrowing memories, alleging that her former husband had drugged, raped and took photographs when she was unconscious.In a report by the BBC, the woman said that her husband has been abusive and controlling in private. To hide the identity of the victim, the BBC gave her the name ""Kate.""She told that one evening her husband had been drugging her tea at night with sleeping medication so he could rape her while she was unconscious and taking photographs of his assaults. Speechless and frozen by disbelief, Kate struggled to comprehend the enormity of his betrayal.For years, her husband had been abusive and controlling in private. His behavior was violent and he frequently misused prescription medications.Kate said there had been times when she woke up during non-consensual sexual acts, which her husband would later dismiss as unintentional, claiming he was asleep and unwell.Following his confession, he pleaded with Kate not to go to the police, fearing his life would be over. Initially, Kate remained silent, however, over the months, she became very ill and started having panic attacks.Kate said that nearly a year later, she confided in her sister, who immediately called their mother.Their mother then called the police, and her ex-husband was arrested and questioned. However, just four days later, she withdrew the case overwhelmed by grief. “I just wasn't ready.""Six months later after her husband moved out of the house, Kate returned to the police.Kate told BBC that the detective explained to her that she was a survivor of a serious crime and empowered her to reclaim what had been taken. He clearly explained that what she had endured was rape.Her ex-husband's medical records provided undeniable evidence. After his confession to Kate, he had privately consulted a psychiatrist, during which he admitted to ""drugging his wife in order to have sex with her while she was asleep.""Despite this compelling evidence, the crown prosecution service (CPS) initially decided not to press charges. Determined, she applied for a formal review of the decision. Six months later, the CPS reversed its stance and said that her ex-husband will now be charged.The case finally went to court in 2022, five long years after his initial confession. Following a week-long trial, the jury found him found guilty of rape, sexual assault by penetration and administering a substance with intent.The sentencing judge described him as a ""self-obsessed person"" lacking genuine remorse and sentenced him to 11-years in prison, along with a lifelong restraining order.Kate could draw similarities between her and Gisèle Pelicot’s case, the French woman who was drugged and raped by her ex-husband, who also hired dozens of men to abuse her.","A woman in the United Kingdom recalled her harrowing memories, alleging that her former husband had drugged, raped and took photographs when she was unconscious.

Second consecutive year of the initiative





Balancing education with wellbeing





On-site staff and optional in-person attendance





Comprehensive guidance and enrichment activities





Support students’ academic progress

Reinforce the values of the holy month

Strengthen family engagement

Enhance students’ sense of community







As Ramadan approaches, the UAE is once again reshaping the school week. Public school students across the country will study from home every Friday during the holy month, as part of a renewed effort to bring families closer while keeping lessons on track.The UAE’s Ministry of Education announced on Thursday, that distance learning will be implemented on Fridays throughout Ramadan for students enrolled in government schools. This marks the second consecutive year the initiative has been introduced.The programme, titled “Ramadan with Family”, is designed to give pupils additional time at home while ensuring academic continuity. By adjusting the school schedule at the end of each week, the ministry aims to align learning with the social and spiritual rhythms of Ramadan.Under the arrangement, students will study remotely from home every Friday during the fasting month.According to the ministry, the measure forms part of broader Ramadan adjustments to the academic calendar. The objective is to balance educational requirements with students’ wellbeing and family life during the holy month.Officials have previously noted that flexible arrangements during Ramadan can help improve student focus and better support household routines, particularly during fasting hours.Reducing commuting time is also seen as a way to ease daily pressures on families.The initiative also comes in line with the Year of the Family, reinforcing the government’s wider emphasis on strengthening family bonds and community cohesion.While students will shift to remote learning on Fridays, teaching and educational staff will continue to work on-site at schools.The ministry has clarified that parents who prefer their children to attend classes in person will be given that option. However, parents or guardians will be responsible for arranging transportation to and from school on those days.This approach allows families to choose what best suits their circumstances while maintaining operational continuity within schools.To support the initiative, the Ministry of Education will issue a comprehensive guidance handbook. The manual will contain integrated educational and enrichment activities drawn directly from the school curriculum.These activities are intended to:In addition, a detailed guidance manual will outline joint educational and developmental activities derived from the curriculum, ensuring that remote learning remains structured and purposeful.By combining flexible scheduling with curriculum-based enrichment, the ministry aims to maintain academic standards while giving students meaningful opportunities to engage with their families during Ramadan.","The UAE’s Ministry of Education announced on Thursday, that distance learning will be implemented on Fridays throughout Ramadan.

Plaqueboymax reveals Tyla Valentine DM moment and shares NBA All Star Weekend plans with Bose and Lil Yachty





Plaqueboymax set social media on fire just days before Valentine’s Day. On February 12, 2026, a clip from his Twitch livestream began spreading on X after a user account @FearedBuck shared it. In the video, the popular streamer revealed that he had sent a direct message and a voice note to singer Tyla , asking her to be his Valentine. He openly told viewers that he admires her music and wanted to “shoot his shot.”During the stream, Plaqueboymax recorded himself speaking to Tyla. In the message, he said, “I really like your music. I understand you may not know me yet, and that is okay. I just wanted to say I enjoy your songs a lot. Would you be my Valentine?” But just seconds after sending it, he quickly changed his mind. He deleted the audio and told his viewers, “No, no, no. We have to rephrase this.” That small moment made fans laugh and quickly turned into a viral topic online.The Valentine message was not the only reason Plaqueboymax trended that day. In the same February 12 Twitch livestream, he also shared major career news. He announced that he has been invited to take part in NBA All-Star Weekend activities through a collaboration with Bose.Plaqueboymax explained that on Friday, February 13, he will team up with NBA players for a creative project. According to him, the idea is to turn basketball stars into “superstar artists,” mixing music and sports culture in one event. He told viewers, “On Friday, we are linking up with some NBA players and we will be turning them into superstar artists.”Then he shared his Saturday plans. He said he would be playing basketball with rapper Lil Yachty and members of the Concrete Boys. Speaking about the games, he added, “On Saturday, we will be getting some runs hooping with Yachty and the Concrete Boys. I need some people I can run with.”As if that was not enough, Plaqueboymax also addressed another situation during his stream. He publicly supported Aspen Kartier after recent animal abuse allegations surfaced online. He made it clear that he stands by Kartier during the controversy.From a deleted Valentine voice note to a high-profile NBA All-Star Weekend invite, February 12 turned into a big day for Plaqueboymax.

Braden “Clavicular” responds after Joseph Bernstein reports Maricopa County Attorney drops felony charges







Braden “Clavicular” is speaking out after a sudden twist in his legal case. On February 11, 2026, The New York Times reporter Joseph Bernstein shared on X that the Maricopa County Attorney had dropped the felony charges against the 20-year-old Kick streamer. The decision came just days after Clavicular was arrested near Arizona State University in Arizona on February 7, 2026. Police had accused him of using a fake ID to enter a bar while underage. Reports said he was facing two felony counts, including forgery and possession of forged instruments, along with a misdemeanor for entering an establishment as a minor with false identification.But according to Bernstein, a public information officer said there was “no reasonable likelihood of conviction,” and that is why the charges were dropped. Clavicular quickly reacted online. Quote-tweeting Bernstein’s post, he wrote, “You just gotta mog.” His response spread fast across social media, with many users sharing their own views on what happened.After Joseph Bernstein’s post went live, Clavicular leaned into the moment. Along with his short reply, he shared a screenshot of a 2017 article that discussed how facial features might influence sentencing decisions.The study mentioned in that article suggested there could be a link between appearance and how harsh a punishment is.Online reactions came in quickly. One Reddit user wrote, “Not surprising. Whatever you think about him, as far as I know this was his first offense. They were not putting a first time offending 20 year old in jail for eight years for a fake ID to get into a bar.” Another commented, “Good for him.” Others made jokes using slang tied to Clavicular’s online persona.Just a day before the charges were dropped, on February 10, 2026, Clavicular spoke about his legal fight during a Kick stream. He claimed he had spent around $100,000 on lawyers. He described his legal team by saying, “I basically hired the New York Yankees of lawyers. I have spent probably $100,000 on legal retainers easily this week. So, yeah, it is going pretty well with that. We will figure it out.”Earlier in the month, on February 3, 2026, Clavicular had already gone viral after a livestream involving his girlfriend Violet and TikToker Jenny Popach drew attention online. That moment added to the spotlight around him before his arrest even happened.Now, with the felony charges officially dropped by the Maricopa County Attorney, Clavicular is no longer facing the serious counts that first made headlines.","Braden ""Clavicular"" was arrested near Arizona State University on February 7, 2026.

LEAKED Call? Candace Owens Says TPUSA Held Secret Zoom After Charlie Kirk Died

Candace Owens questions missing wedding photo of Charlie Kirk as TPUSA responds with clarification







Erika Kirk is facing fresh questions online after viewers noticed something small in the background of her December 2025 interview. The photo of her and her late husband, Charlie Kirk, that once sat on a bookshelf in his home office did not appear where people expected it. Soon, social media users began to wonder if she had moved it. Some even linked it to earlier claims that she had kept everything in the house exactly the same after his assassination.As the posts spread, Turning Point USA stepped in. A spokesperson for the group told Newsweek that the photo was not removed from the room. They explained that Erika Kirk had simply placed it on a lower shelf so her daughter could reach it. The spokesperson said, “Erika moved it to a lower shelf when her daughter asked to see it so she could hold and look at the photo. It’s still on the studio shelf, just lower down where her daughter can look at it whenever she’s in there with her mom. ”The issue began when online users compared two moments. In Charlie Kirk’s September 8 livestream, the wedding photo could clearly be seen on the bookshelf behind him. But in Erika Kirk’s December 2025 interview with Glenn Beck, the frame was no longer in that same spot. That difference led to sharp comments on X, including one post from Ginny Robinson that accused Erika of removing the picture.Candace Owens then joined the conversation. Replying on X, she wrote, “It’s entirely possible Charlie removed it when he removed his wedding ring the night before. When they had a priest come pray over them and their marriage…” She later discussed the topic on her YouTube channel. In the video, she questioned Erika’s earlier statements about leaving everything untouched.Candace Owens said, “During that interview, she was playing the part, as you are about to see, of ‘This is my first time back in his office.’ And she keeps looking down and she says, ‘Sorry, I’m looking down. I’m just looking at all of these things that Charlie left over on his desk.’” She added, “The obvious insinuation to the public being that she had not yet traversed into that space… and yet, curiously, that wedding photo is missing. Okay. The internet was correct to call that out.”Still, Candace Owens also suggested another possibility. She said, “Charlie himself moved the frame, and he would have had to do this on the 9th, the day before his assassination.” She called it a “genuine oversight” and noted that the family and team may not have focused on small background details during such a painful time.Earlier in December, Erika Kirk had written on Instagram about keeping Charlie’s belongings the same. She shared, “I’ve kept everything in the home still the same after these several months, your socks still on the floor, your shoes by the door, your vitamins everywhere on the counter. That’s how it’ll stay.” She also wrote, “I owe the world nothing.”For now, TPUSA’s statement to Newsweek stands as the only confirmed update. The wedding photo, they say, was moved lower on the same shelf, not removed.","Candace Owens questions missing wedding photo of Charlie Kirk as TPUSA responds with clarification.

24 grams of coffee — that’s the weight of the ground beans.



360 grams of water — measured by weight, not volume, which is standard in speciality brewing.



A 1:15 ratio of coffee to water (24g to 360g), considered balanced and fairly strong.



202°F water, which converts to roughly 94°C, just below boiling.



A grinder setting marked “-7K”, likely referring to a relatively fine grind suited to pour-over extraction.

When the US Department of Justice released its latest tranche of Jeffrey Epstein documents, part of the Epstein files, a release running to more than 3.5 million documents, images, and videos, most of the attention focused on the names, travel logs, and previously unseen exchanges, including emails, financial records, and personal correspondence.Tucked inside that same cache was something far more mundane: a detailed step-by-step pour-over coffee manual.The email , forwarded in July 2013 to Karyna Shuliak, his longtime-girlfriend, whom the files say he intended to marry and who, according to his will, is set to inherit over $100 million of whatever remains of his estate, outlines a highly specific V60 coffee brewing method. Epstein offered to show her in person and provided detailed instructions so she could try it herself. Since resurfacing online, influencers and coffee enthusiasts have begun recreating what social media now calls the “Jeffrey Epstein coffee.”The method centres on a V60, a Japanese cone-shaped manual coffee dripper that uses paper filters. Popular in specialty coffee circles, it’s prized for its clean extraction and precise control over brewing.The instructions specify precise steps down to seconds, weights, and volumes, reading less like a casual kitchen note and more like a lab protocol, surprisingly detailed for someone who must have been very busy, suggesting he had plenty of time to perfect the process.Before brewing, he instructs the recipient to rinse the paper filter with hot water (to remove paper taste), add the ground coffee, shake it flat, and press a small indentation in the centre with a thumb. That indentation helps water flow evenly through the grounds.Then comes the timed pouring sequence, measured down to the second:He also includes adjustments:If the coffee tastes sour, it is under-extracted: Grind finer.If it tastes bitter, it is over-extracted: Grind coarser.If it feels watery: Increase the coffee dose.In the same thread, Epstein mentions a Tonx coffee subscription, a high-end roast-to-order service founded by Tony Konecny, later acquired by Blue Bottle Coffee in 2014 and now operating as YESPLZ Coffee. Tony shared in a social media reel that, according to the DOJ files, credit card statements and receipts show Epstein had ordered the coffee for at least a couple of months.He said it was wild that Epstein, of all people, was one of his many high-profile clients when he was selling beans online in 2013, for which he now even has an email as proof, showing Epstein personally vouching for his coffee.The email to Epstein’s girlfriend also included recommendations for another coffee brand and numerous Amazon and other links to assemble a complete starter brewing kit, showing how specific and meticulous he was in curating his coffee setup.He may have been a coffee connoisseur among his elite circles, meticulously curating beans, brewing techniques, and starter kits, a surprisingly precise taste for someone with so many other claims on his time. But all of that doesn't even begin to obscure the broader reality: Epstein was arrested in 2019 on federal charges related to sex trafficking of minors and died later that year in a New York jail cell. The ongoing document releases continue to shed light on his activities, associates, and sprawling estate, revealing many names, shocking details, and other dark and disturbing aspects of Epstein’s life.But what stands out here is the contrast.In between emails about logistics and travel, there is a meticulous breakdown of pour timings, gram weights and water temperature. Online, some have found dark irony in the precision. Others are simply treating it as a technically sound V60 guide and brewing it at home.Strip away the name, and it is a standard specialty coffee method: measured dose, controlled spiral pours, three-minute total extraction. It is not revolutionary, nor amateur, but the precision hints at just how particular his taste and meticulous habits must have been.","Jeffrey Epstein sent detailed instructions to his girlfriend on how to make his coffee.

Water and oxygen aren’t enough: Scientists reveal two ‘must-have’ ingredients for life on other planets,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/science/water-and-oxygen-arent-enough-scientists-reveal-two-must-have-ingredients-for-life-on-other-planets/articleshow/128272637.cms,"Milky Way galaxy (Source: NASA)

Searching the right stars

For decades, the search for extraterrestrial life has revolved around a simple rule: follow the water. If a distant planet has liquid water, and perhaps oxygen, it is flagged as potentially habitable.But new research led by scientists at ETH Zurich suggests that this long-standing strategy may be incomplete. A planet can have oceans and continents, the researchers argue, and still be chemically incapable of supporting life. The real constraint may lie much deeper, in the chemistry of a planet’s formation.The study, published inunder the title “The chemical habitability of Earth and rocky planets prescribed by core formation” , was led by Dr Craig R. Walton, a postdoctoral researcher at the Centre for Origin and Prevalence of Life at ETH Zurich, alongside Professor Maria Schönbächler and colleagues.Their central claim is precise: life depends not just on water and oxygen, but on whether two critical elements, phosphorus and nitrogen, remained accessible in a planet’s mantle during its earliest formation.Phosphorus is required to build DNA and RNA, the molecules that store and transmit genetic information. It also plays a key role in cellular energy systems. Nitrogen, meanwhile, is an essential component of proteins, the structural and functional building blocks of cells.Without both, life “as we know it simply cannot form”.“During the formation of a planet’s core, there needs to be exactly the right amount of oxygen present so that phosphorus and nitrogen can remain on the surface of the planet,” Walton explained.Young rocky planets begin as molten bodies. As they cool, heavy elements such as iron sink to form the core, while lighter material forms the mantle and crust. At the same time, oxygen levels determine how elements chemically partition between metal and rock.If oxygen is scarce, phosphorus bonds with iron and sinks into the core, effectively removing it from the surface environment. If oxygen is too abundant, phosphorus stays in the mantle, but nitrogen is more likely to escape into the atmosphere and eventually be lost to space.“Having too much or too little oxygen in the planet as a whole – not in the atmosphere per se – makes the planet unsuitable for life because it traps key nutrients for life in the core,” Walton told the. “A different oxygen balance means you have nothing to work with left at the surface when the planet cools and you form rocks.”Using numerical modelling, the team identified what they describe as a very narrow “chemical Goldilocks zone,” an intermediate oxygen range in which both phosphorus and nitrogen remain in the mantle in quantities sufficient for life.“Our models clearly show that the Earth is precisely within this range,” Walton said. “If we had had just a little more or a little less oxygen during core formation, there would not have been enough phosphorus or nitrogen for the development of life.”Earth appears to have struck that balance around 4.6 billion years ago.The findings suggest that many planets previously considered promising may be chemically unsuitable for life from the outset, even if they contain water.While no known life can survive without liquid water, the researchers argue that using oxygen or water alone as markers of habitability may be misleading. A planet’s total oxygen balance during its formation, not simply atmospheric oxygen, determines whether life-critical elements remain available.Walton warned that this may significantly narrow the number of habitable worlds in the universe. He suggested there may be just one to 10 per cent as many habitable planets as previously estimated.“It would be very disappointing to travel all the way to such a planet to colonise it and find there is no phosphorus for growing food,” he said. “We’d better try to check the formation conditions of the planet first, much like ensuring your dinner was cooked properly before you go ahead and eat it.”Closer to home, the research suggests that Mars lies just outside this chemical zone. Mars appears to contain relatively abundant phosphorus, but significantly lower nitrogen levels near the surface. In addition, harsh salts and other surface chemistry make the soil inhospitable.“Mars is fairly similar to Earth, and its formation conditions mean there is more phosphorus, not less. This means growing food there might be relatively easy,” Walton said. But he added that the nitrogen deficit and surface chemistry pose major challenges: “It is not that different, but it is not currently habitable, Elon Musk will have to come up with a clever way to change the composition to grow food there.”Directly measuring the internal chemistry of distant rocky planets remains extremely difficult. However, astronomers can infer likely planetary compositions by studying host stars.Planets form from the same material as their parent stars. The oxygen abundance and overall chemical structure of a star therefore shape the composition of its planetary system.Solar systems whose stars closely resemble our Sun may offer better odds.“This makes searching for life on other planets a lot more specific,” Walton said. “We should look for solar systems with stars that resemble our own Sun.”The work reframes the long-running search for life beyond Earth. Water remains necessary. But it may not be enough. A planet’s fate, whether sterile or living, could hinge on a delicate chemical balance struck in its first molten moments, long before oceans, atmospheres or continents ever formed.","Phosphorus and nitrogen are critical for life: phosphorus forms DNA, RNA, and ATP for energy, while nitrogen builds proteins.

Since WIG technology operates close to the surface, performance in rough seas or adverse conditions will need careful evaluation. Infrastructure: Harbours, ports, and docking facilities will need upgrades to support widespread seaglider operations.





A groundbreaking new electric seaglider transport system that promises to let people literally glide across the water could soon become a reality in Abu Dhabi and the wider UAE, signalling a major shift in how coastal travel and logistics are handled across the region. The concept, which blends high-speed marine and aircraft technologies with zero emissions, is advancing rapidly through government partnerships and private sector innovation.Electric seagliders are fully electric, Wing-in-Ground-Effect (WIG) craft, designed to travel just above the water’s surface using aerodynamic lift combined with hydrofoil technology. These vehicles are more efficient than traditional boats and far quicker than typical marine transport because they ride on a cushion of air over the water.A prominent model in development is the REGENT Viceroy, an electric WIG vehicle capable of carrying several passengers at speeds potentially reaching 290 kph (180 mph), with long-range capabilities as battery technology advances.According to recent updates, Abu Dhabi leaders and transport authorities have signed a deal with operators to bring electric seagliders to the emirate by 2028. These craft, which combine zero emissions and high speed, are expected to connect coastal communities like Abu Dhabi City and Al Dhafra Region initially, with plans to expand routes across the broader UAE coast.The project reflects a strategic collaboration involving the Department of Culture and Tourism, Abu Dhabi (DCT Abu Dhabi), the Abu Dhabi Investment Office (ADIO) and the Integrated Transport Centre (Abu Dhabi Mobility) alongside private operators. Badr Al-Olama, Director General of ADIO, has emphasised that seagliders could position Abu Dhabi at the forefront of next-generation coastal transportation, integrating smart and sustainable mobility into everyday life.The potential applications of this new tech are wide-ranging:Prototype and development efforts are already underway as electric seaglider models have entered sea testing phases with crew onboard and full-scale testing has been reported by developers in the U.S. ahead of expected passenger flights. REGENT, the main company driving this technology and its partners, expect commercial readiness between 2026 and 2028, aligning with Abu Dhabi’s plans for phased rollouts and expanded mobility options along coastal routes.The UAE’s interest in seagliders sits alongside a wider effort to develop electric and autonomous transport solutions across land, air and sea. Initiatives such as electric air taxi ambitions in Abu Dhabi and advanced road automation trials showcase a holistic approach to future mobility. Embedded in policy visions like the UAE’s Net Zero by 2050 Strategy, these innovations aim not just to improve travel times but to reduce carbon footprints, encourage clean technology adoption and transform how people and goods move in the 21st century.Despite the promise, several challenges remain:These issues reflect the broader maturation curve for any disruptive transport technology entering public use. As the UAE pushes toward diversified, sustainable transportation models, electric seagliders represent a visionary leap beyond traditional ferries and hydrofoils. They encapsulate cutting-edge engineering, zero-emission ambitions and a shift toward seamless coastal mobility and if plans proceed as expected, we may soon see them gliding above UAE waters within the next few years.Electric seagliders, once futuristic concept vehicles, are now transitioning from prototype to planned deployments in the UAE. With projected commercial operations by 2028 and partnerships spanning government, logistics and energy sectors, this innovative mode of transport could redefine coastal travel, tourism and logistics across the Emirates, showing how sustainable mobility solutions are reshaping the world’s busiest maritime corridors.","Electric seagliders could dramatically cut travel times compared with traditional boats and road transport along the coast.

How much are overstay fines in the UAE?



Visitor or tourist visa holders begin accruing AED 50 per day from the day after their visa expires.

Residents also pay AED 50 per day after a 30-day grace period, which applies following visa cancellation.

Additional administrative and service fees such as exit and e-service charges may also apply when finalising overstay penalties.

Unlike in years past, most tourist and visit visas no longer include a grace period after expiry and fines begin accruing immediately once the visa period lapses.

no longer include a grace period after expiry and fines begin accruing immediately once the visa period lapses. For residents whose visas have been formally cancelled (e.g., due to job changes), the UAE provides a 30-day grace period before fines begin, during which the holder must either exit the country or adjust their status.

Consequences of unpaid fines in the UAE



Travel bans that prevent departure until fines are paid.

Blocked future visa applications until outstanding penalties are cleared.

Accumulating daily charges that significantly raise the total cost the longer the overstay continues.

Where and how to pay overstay fines



Online via the Immigration Authority Portals – The Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Port Security (ICP) website lets visitors and residents view and pay fines directly with a credit/debit card.

The Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Port Security (ICP) website lets visitors and residents view and pay fines directly with a credit/debit card. Dubai-Specific Portal – Residents in Dubai can also use the General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs (GDRFA) platform to check fines and settle outstanding amounts.

Residents in can also use the General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs (GDRFA) platform to check fines and settle outstanding amounts. In-Person at Immigration or Service Centres – Overstay fines can be cleared at Amer centres, registered typing centres, or at immigration counters in airports and land borders before departure.

Tips to avoid overstay charges



Track visa expiry dates carefully and set reminders well in advance.

Apply for extensions or visa status adjustments before expiry if you plan to stay longer.

If status changes occur (e.g., job shifts for residents), ensure cancellation or renewal processes are initiated timely.





As millions of travellers and expatriates continue to live, work and visit the UAE, authorities have standardised visa overstay penalties and streamlined payment options, making compliance clearer but also more urgent than ever. Under the latest immigration framework, overstaying your visa in the UAE now carries a unified daily fine across most visa types, with simple online and in-person payment options for residents and visitors alike.If you stay in the UAE beyond the validity of your visa, you are likely to face fines. In recent years, UAE immigration authorities have standardised the penalty system and made it easier to check and pay overstay fines online or in person. Here’s what you need to know to stay compliant and avoid extra costs.Recent regulatory updates have consolidated the overstay penalty system where visitors, tourists and residents who remain beyond their permitted stay now face a daily fine of AED 50 ($13.6) per day. This flat rate applies regardless of visa category and replaces older systems that once charged different amounts for different visa types. In other words, this unified rate replaces older systems where resident overstays sometimes carried different charges, making the fines easier to calculate.Under the standardised structure:Extended overstays can lead to more than just daily charges. In some cases authorities may impose exit bans, preventing travellers from leaving the country until penalties are cleared. Failure to settle fines can also complicate future UAE visa applications and travel plans.Failing to settle overstay fines can lead to additional issues, including:Further, immigration law enforcement may escalate legal action against repeat or prolonged violators, including possible deportation or temporary travel restrictions, depending on individual circumstances.UAE authorities have made it relatively easy to check and settle overstay fines through multiple official channels:Authorities advise ensuring all accumulated fines are paid before attempting to exit the UAE, as unresolved penalties may block departure until they are cleared.To sidestep fines altogether:Understanding the current overstay fine system is vital for anyone living in or visiting the UAE. With penalties now uniform and payment methods widely accessible, staying compliant is not just a legal obligation; it can also save visitors and expats significant costs and complications at the airport or immigration checkpoints.Visa overstay fines in the UAE, currently AED 50 per day for most visa types, can add up quickly, especially if there is no grace period for your visa category. The authorities now provide online tools to check and pay fines, making it easier to comply and avoid travel bans or blocks on future visas. Planning ahead, tracking expiry dates and using official portals or service centres will help you avoid unnecessary penalties.","Visitor or tourist visa holders begin accruing AED 50 per day from the day after their visa expires.

Suspect found dead, motive unclear

What PM Mark Carney said





For 12-year-old Maya Edmonds, Tuesday began like any other school day. By evening, she was in critical care, fighting for her life after being shot in the head and neck during a deadly attack at her school.Maya is currently undergoing intensive treatment at Vancouver Children’s Hospital. Doctors are working to repair the damage from her injuries, and her recovery timeline remains uncertain.“Today started as any other. Now my 12-year-old daughter is fighting for her life,” her mother wrote in an emotional social media post. “This doesn’t even feel real… I never thought I would be asking for prayers, but please, please pray for my baby.”Maya was among at least 25 people injured in the shooting at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School. Police have confirmed that eight people were killed in the attack.For her family, however, the numbers fade beside the image of their daughter lying in a hospital bed. A fundraising campaign launched by relatives has already raised significant support to help cover medical and travel expenses, allowing her mother to remain by her side.The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) said the suspect was found deceased inside the school from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.Authorities have not publicly released the name. Police described the suspect as a female and confirmed investigators are working to determine the motive behind the attack.Two additional bodies were discovered at a nearby residence believed to be connected to the suspect. Officials initially reported a higher death toll but later clarified that one critically injured victim survived and remains in serious condition.Investigators are examining whether there were warning signs or prior interactions that could shed light on what led to the tragedy.Addressing the nation, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney called it “a very difficult day for the country.” “This morning, parents, grandparents, sisters and brothers will wake up without someone they love,” he said, appearing visibly shaken.Carney announced that flags on federal buildings would be flown at half-mast for seven days and urged Canadians to come together in support of the grieving community.“We will get through this. We will learn from this. But right now, it is a time to come together, to mourn together and to support one another,” he said.In Tumbler Ridge, a small and tightly knit community, the tragedy has left families reeling. But in a hospital room in Vancouver, the focus remains on one 12-year-old girl whose fight for survival has become the most personal face of a national tragedy.","Maya Edmonds, 12, is fighting for her life after being shot in the head and neck.

‘Uncle Jeffrey’: Top Goldman Sachs lawyer Kathryn Ruemmler resigns over Epstein links — details of exchange emerge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/uncle-jeffrey-top-goldman-sachs-lawyer-kathryn-ruemmler-resigns-over-epstein-links-details-of-exchange-emerge/articleshow/128286821.cms,"Ruemmler's ties to Epstein



Emails detail advice, personal exchanges and years-long ties







Kathryn Ruemmler, chief legal officer at Goldman Sachs and one of the highest paid lawyers in the US, resigned on Thursday night after the justice department released emails and other documents detailing her extensive relationship with infamous financier and convicted sex offender, Jeffrey Epstein For years, Ruemmler and the financial services firm had maintained that her contact with Epstein was strictly professional. However, emails, text messages and photographs released to the public last month presented a completely different picture, indicating that the lawyer had been closer to him even before she joined Goldman in 2020.Goldman’s chief executive David M Solomon said in a statement that he had accepted her resignation, “and I respect her decision.”Ruemmler had been general counsel since 2021 and also served as a partner and vice chair of the bank’s reputational risk committee. Earlier, she worked as White House counsel under Barack Obama and later as a white-collar defence lawyer at Latham & Watkins.“My responsibility is to put Goldman Sachs' interests first,” Ruemmler said.Goldman had defended her in recent weeks, saying that her links with Epstein happened before she was hired and were appropriate.However, the Justice Department’s latest release, more than 10,000 documents mentioning her, showed a relationship that stretched over many years.The records showed Ruemmler acting as a counsellor, confidant and friend to Epstein. She advised him on how to answer difficult questions about his sex crimes, spoke about her own dating life, discussed ways to avoid negative media coverage and called him “sweetie” and “Uncle Jeffrey”.According to The Guardian, an email “So lovely and thoughtful! Thank you to Uncle Jeffrey!!!” Ruemmler wrote to Epstein in 2018.In return, Epstein offered career guidance about her move to Goldman, introduced her to prominent businesspeople and gave her gifts including spa treatments, luxury goods and high-end travel. Furthermore, within the hundreds of messages examined by CNN about Epstein’s legal troubles and damage to his reputation, there were also more intimate notes between the pair, including talk of a potential trip to his island and references to presents he had given her.From 2014, Kathryn began what she described in one email as a “friendship”. She explained Epstein how the law distinguishes between underage victims of sex crimes and adult prostitutes. “I think the point is that if she was underage, she could not legally consent to engaging in prostitution,” Ruemmler wrote to Epstein in 2015.She also advised the disgraced financer on how to challenge the credibility of an accuser, saying in one message that his lawyer could push the woman into a “perjury trap.”Back in 2015, on Epstein’s 62nd birthday, Ruemmler sent him an email, writing, “I hope you enjoy the day with your one true love. :-)”. Some emails ended with “xoxo”, and the two exchanged photographs. In other conversations, she joked about the weight of visitors at New Jersey rest stops and speculated about the sexual orientation of a well-known hedge fund billionaire, according to the New York Times.Ruemmler, over a series of meetings, also asked for Epstein’s views on personal and professional issues, including her dating concerns. “men aren't interested in women my age,” one email said.Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs and Ruemmler have maintained that Epstein was never her client. Yet in 2018, when she helped him edit a legal document defending his 2008 plea deal for soliciting prostitution from a minor, the emails between them carried the subject line, “Attorney Client.”","Kathryn Ruemmler, one of the highest paid lawyers in the US, resigned on Thursday night.

CNN’s Kaitlan Collins reveals rare act of kindness from Karoline Leavitt after Saudi security standoff,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/cnns-kaitlan-collins-reveals-rare-act-of-kindness-from-karoline-leavitt-after-saudi-security-standoff/articleshow/128282297.cms,"



White House press briefings rarely produce moments of mutual praise. But CNN anchor Kaitlan Collins recently acknowledged one, and it involved one of her most frequent sparring partners, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt.Appearing on Heather McMahan’s Absolutely podcast, Collins recounted an incident during a presidential trip to Saudi Arabia when she was nearly barred from attending a press event after asking a question that unsettled local officials. Saudi authorities, she explained, are not accustomed to aggressive questioning from reporters.According to Collins, after she posed a question, “the Saudi Royal Guard kind of freaked out.”“They came up, and they said, ‘Okay, well you can’t come into the next event,’ which was like two minutes later, and I was like, ‘That’s not how this works, I belong to the U.S. press,’ and they were like, ‘Well, you’re not coming in,’” Collins said on the podcast.She described the guards as “whispering and pointing” at her, while junior White House officials hesitated over how to respond. Ultimately, the matter was escalated to Leavitt.“To her credit, she said, ‘No, Kaitlan’s coming in with the rest of the U.S. press,’ and we went in, and so it didn’t become this big issue,” Collins said, giving the press secretary rare public acknowledgment for intervening.The moment of professional respect stands in contrast to the often-contentious exchanges between the two in the White House briefing room.In December 2025, Collins challenged President Donald Trump’s claims about economic strength during a briefing. “If the economy is as strong as the president has said it is, then why is he telling parents two weeks before Christmas that they should only buy two or three dolls for their children?” she asked.Leavitt pushed back forcefully. “Look, what the president is saying is that if we want products made right here in America, if we want them to be made from American small businesses, which is a large part of the reason the president has effectively implemented tariffs, then we’re going to have better quality products right here in the United States,” she responded.She added, “Maybe you’ll pay a dollar or two more, but you will get better quality, and you’ll be supporting your fellow Americans by buying American.”Collins continued pressing, raising concerns about rising grocery prices and what she described as “mixed signals.” Leavitt fired back sharply.“My predecessor stood up at this podium, and she said inflation doesn’t exist. She said the border was secure and people like you just took her at her word, and that those were two utter lies,” Leavitt told Collins.She also took aim at CNN directly. “Well, I think the president’s comments yesterday about the sale of CNN and new leadership are evidenced by my exchange with the CNN reporter in this room. Their viewership has gone down, their ratings have declined, and I think the president rightfully believes that network would benefit from new ownership. With respect to this deal, he has great respect for both companies that are bidding against one another. ”",CNN anchor Kaitlan Collins and White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt had a rare moment of professional respect.

RFK Jr says he ‘snorted cocaine off toilet seats’ as he explains why he’s ‘not scared of a germ’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/rfk-jr-says-he-snorted-cocaine-off-toilet-seats-as-he-explains-why-hes-not-scared-of-a-germ/articleshow/128281276.cms,"



The Department of Health and Human Services has increasingly found itself at the center of controversy, as its secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., advances health claims that critics say are not backed by established scientific consensus and often challenge long-standing medical guidance.That tension between mainstream public health policy and Kennedy’s personal views resurfaced this week during an appearance on comedian Theo Von’s podcast, This Past Weekend w/ Theo Von, where the HHS chief spoke candidly about his past drug addiction, and made a remark that quickly drew attention.“I said this when we came in and, I said, ‘I don't care what happens, I'm going to a meeting every day.’ I'm not scared of a germ. I used to snort cocaine off of toilet seats,” Kennedy said during the episode.The 72-year-old official explained that he has been sober for more than four decades and still attends daily recovery meetings. He told Von that during the 2020 COVID-19 shutdowns, he organized what he described as a “pirate group” so recovering addicts could continue meeting despite restrictions.“I know this disease will kill me if I don't treat it, which for me means going to meetings every day.It's just bad for my life. So, for me, it was survival,” he added.Kennedy and Von also discussed the importance of the recovery community in maintaining sobriety. Kennedy’s struggles with addiction date back to his youth: he was arrested at 16 for marijuana possession and, at 30, was arrested in South Dakota for heroin possession, an incident that pushed him toward treatment.His remarks about germs and past drug use come as Kennedy remains under scrutiny for his leadership at HHS. Since taking office under President Donald Trump, he has promoted his “Making America Healthy Again” platform, arguing that chronic disease in the United States is linked to environmental toxins, chemicals in food, and what he describes as systemic failures in medicine.Medical experts, however, have raised alarms over several of his positions. Kennedy has long questioned vaccine safety, a stance widely rejected by leading health organizations, though he denies being anti-vaccine. While serving as HHS secretary, he dismissed a group of vaccine specialists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including its chief, and replaced them with individuals described as vaccine skeptics, prompting criticism from lawmakers and public health advocates.He has also withdrawn contracts and cut $500 million in funding for 22 mRNA vaccine research projects. In addition, he eliminated a federal regulation encouraging hospitals to track and report staff vaccination levels.Kennedy has previously suggested a link between vaccines and autism, a claim consistently debunked by large-scale scientific studies. He has also supported assertions connecting acetaminophen use during pregnancy with autism, a theory many researchers say relies on disputed evidence.","Robert F.

Deletes Video Of Obamas As Monkeys | White House Blames Staffer





President Donald Trump on Thursday defended the posting of a racially charged video depicting former President Barack Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama as apes by suggesting it was tied to Disney’s The Lion King.The controversy stems from a video shared last week on Trump’s Truth Social account that portrayed the Obamas, alongside other Democratic leaders, as animals, invoking a well-known racist trope. The post was later deleted by the White House, which said a staffer had “erroneously made the post.” The identity of that staffer has not been disclosed.During an Environmental Protection Agency event at the White House, a reporter pressed Trump on whether anyone had faced consequences. “Mr. President, have you fired or disciplined that staffer who posted the video from your account that included the Obamas?” the reporter asked.“No, I haven't,” Trump replied. “That was a video on, as you know, voter fraud and fairly long video, and they had a little piece and had to do with the Lion King.”He continued to defend the broader clip, arguing it had circulated widely before appearing on his account.“It's been very, well, it's been shown all over the place long before that was posted,” Trump said.“But that was a very strong, and I'm sure you saw it, a very strong piece on voter fraud. And the piece that you're talking about was all over the place. Many times, I believe, for years.”Hours after Trump shared the video, right-wing influencer Laura Loomer posted a longer version portraying numerous elected officials as animals, including Trump as “king of the jungle.”The backlash was swift. According to CNN, Republican lawmakers privately urged Trump to take the video down. “Sources tell me Republican lawmakers called Trump directly about the post, asking for it to be removed Of course, many GOP senators & House members also publicly called for him to do so,” CNN White House correspondent Alayna Treene reported.White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt later addressed the matter in a statement.“This is from an internet meme video depicting President Trump as the King of the Jungle and Democrats as characters from The Lion King,” Leavitt said. She added that the video was “fake.”“Please stop the fake outrage and report on something today that actually matters to the American public,” she said.The episode unsettled some Republicans. South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott reacted publicly, saying: “Praying it was fake because it’s the most racist thing I’ve seen out of this White House. The President should remove it.”","President Donald Trump defended the posting of a racially charged video depicting former President Barack Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama as apes.

FBI agents recovered a black glove from a roadside near Nancy Guthrie’s house, in what authorities treated as a potential clue in the search for the masked suspect believed to have abducted the 84-year-old woman, The Post reported.Detectives found the clothing item, which resembled the pair worn by the armed perpetrator caught on video, about one and a half miles from the home of “Today” show co-host Savannah Guthrie’s mother, in a secluded desert suburb on the edge of Tucson.

On Tuesday, the FBI released footage of a man with black gloves, a ski mask, and a holstered gun destroying the security camera on her door.The same day, authorities detained a person of interest for questioning near the Mexican border, but the person was released early today without charges.The person of interest questioned Tuesday was Carlos Palazuelos, a delivery driver from the border town of Rio Rico, who was handcuffed after being pulled over south of Tucson. Palazuelos, now free, insisted he had nothing to do with Guthrie’s abduction, had not even heard of the woman, and demanded an apology from authorities, according to WDBJ.The FBI said the glove was discovered during the neighbourhood search. “We appreciate the assistance and support we have received from the Tucson community,” the FBI said in a statement reminding the public of the $50,000 reward for information leading to Nancy Guthrie’s recovery. Investigators did not comment when asked about the potential piece of evidence.Meanwhile, a note was sent to TMZ on Wednesday morning demanding a bitcoin transfer in exchange for information about Guthrie’s captor. TMZ reported that the $67,000 payment would be in exchange for the “name of the individual involved.”The letter, described as the third alleged note sent out since Nancy was last seen on Jan. 31, contained details of a working bitcoin address, TMZ host Harvey Levin said during Wednesday’s appearance on Fox News’ “America’s Newsroom.” The bitcoin address was different from the one featured in the original ransom note, which was sent to two Tucson-area TV news stations along with TMZ last week. The self-proclaimed kidnappers demanded millions of dollars in crypto currency, setting a final deadline for Monday, Feb. 9.The letter’s authors did not provide proof of life or further information, despite Savannah Guthrie saying her family would pay if it meant getting their mother back safe.","FBI agents recovered a black glove from a roadside near Nancy Guthrie’s house, in what authorities treated as a potential clue in the search for the masked suspect believed to have abducted the 84-year-old woman.

An Indiana Republican lawmaker criticised Purdue University for hiring a foreign software engineer on an H-1B visa , questioning why the taxpayer-funded institution could not find a qualified American for the same role.Andrew Ireland posted on X that Purdue was hiring “ANOTHER foreign software engineer on a H-1B visa” at a salary of $149,000 a year.“Does anyone believe no qualified American could do this job for $149,000 a year? The same school has graduated tens of thousands of computer science students,” he wrote. “This has to stop.”Ireland has previously raised concerns about Purdue’s use of the H-1B visa programme. Last month, he criticised Purdue University Northwest for filing an H-1B visa application to hire a foreign national as an assistant professor of marketing at a salary of $127,500.On January 3, he wrote: “Taxpayer-funded Purdue University disclosed it is hiring a foreigner on an H-1B visa to teach marketing.”He added: “Does anyone seriously believe no American in the Chicago area can teach marketing for $127,500 a year?

According to US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) data, the university filed 265 H-1B Labour Condition Applications in fiscal year 2025, with 258 approved.The H-1B visa is designed for American employers to hire high-skilled foreigners in special roles including tech and defence. However, some MAGA critics and GOP leaders argue that in fields such as marketing, software engineering and data science, there is no shortage of domestic talent in the US, and giving the same jobs to Indian or Chinese workers coming from abroad is straight up robbery.USCIS data show that 399,395 H-1B petitions were approved nationwide in fiscal year 2024, a 3 per cent increase from 2023. Educational institutions accounted for 5.6 per cent of those approvals.Many 'America First' supporters have claimed that high levels of H-1B approvals suppress wages and reduce opportunities for American graduates. At the same time, political figures including US President Donald Trump and business leaders Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy have defended the visa programme as a way to attract highly skilled global talent or the ""best of the best.""","Andrew Ireland posted on X that Purdue was hiring “ANOTHER foreign software engineer on a H-1B visa” at a salary of $149,000 a year.

‘You should resign’: Shouting match erupts between Josh Hawley and Keith Ellison over fraud probe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/you-should-resign-shouting-match-erupts-between-josh-hawley-and-keith-ellison-over-fraud-probe/articleshow/128273768.cms,"



Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison got into a shouting match during a Senate hearing Thursday morning over a federal investigation into fraud in the state.Hawley accused Ellison of being complicit in a fraud scheme that resulted in the theft of federal funds allocated for Minnesota social service programmes. Federal prosecutors estimated that millions of dollars were stolen during the scheme, The Hills reported.“You’ve been right at the center of this project from the beginning, and you’ve enabled it, and you should resign,” Hawley said during his turn to ask questions at the Senate Homeland Security Committee hearing.Ellison retorted, “You should resign. I was thinking the same thing about you.”Hawley, with his voice rising, lobbed a series of accusations at Ellison and suggested that the attorney general should be “indicted” as Ellison vehemently denied the lawmakers’ claims.Hawley claimed that Ellison and his family profited from the scheme. A Minnesota whistleblower alleged that Ellison and other state officials knew about the fraud scheme as early as 2019, but that the officials failed to intervene.“For the record, he’s lying, and that’s the truth,” Ellison said.The interaction was tense from the beginning, with Ellison refusing to answer Hawley’s opening question confirming his job title.“Mr. Ellison, you’re in my courtroom now, you’re under oath, so I suggest that you answer my questions,” Hawley said.Committee Chair Rand Paul (R-Ky.) intervened several times, telling Hawley, “I think we’ve made a point.”Hawley responded, “Oh I’ll ask how I want to, Senator Paul.”At another point in the exchange, Hawley told Ellison, “It’s my hearing, pal.” The two talked over each other with Ellison retorting, “Don’t call me pal.”“I should call you prisoner because you ought to be in jail,” Hawley shot back.Ellison has long been a target of Republicans. He was one of the Minnesota officials subpoenaed by the Justice Department in January over allegations that state officials interfered with the federal immigration operation. The attorney general filed several lawsuits since the immigration enforcement operation began, challenging the federal govt’s actions in the state.Ellison appeared on a panel with other Minnesota officials, including House Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), Minnesota state House GOP Floor Leader Harry Niska, and Minnesota Department of Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell.A second panel at the hearing included U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Joseph Edlow, Customs and Border Protection Director Rodney Scott and acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Todd Lyons. Paul had demanded the three immigration officials appear before the panel after the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti by Border Patrol agents in Minneapolis.Ellison also faced heat during the Thursday morning hearing from Sens. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) and Ashley Moody (R-Fla.).Johnson accused the attorney general of being responsible for the two people killed by federal law enforcement in Minnesota.“Attorney General, you did the exact opposite and two people are dead because you encouraged them to put themselves in harm’s way,” the senator said.Ellison denied Johnson’s accusations.“It was a nice theatrical performance, but it was all lies,” the attorney general said.",Sen.

A Florida handyman who was pardoned by US President Donald Trump for his role in the January 6 US Capitol riot has now been found guilty of multiple child sex abuse charges.Andrew Paul Johnson was convicted on Tuesday by a jury in Florida of five offences. These included molesting a child under 12, molesting another child under 16, and lewd and lascivious exhibition. He was acquitted of one charge of sending sexual material to a child. NPR first reported the verdict.Johnson was arrested in August. According to a police report obtained by NPR, he sexually abused and molested children for multiple monthsDisguised as an 11-year-old's 'ex-boyfriend'The case came to light after the mother of one of the victims discovered that Johnson, described as her “ex-boyfriend”, had sent “inappropriate” messages to her young son on the gaming platform Discord. When she confronted her son, he told her that Johnson had molested him three times “between April 1, 2024, and October 2024,” beginning when he was 11 years old.The police report also said Johnson tried to keep the victim quiet. He allegedly claimed that the Trump administration was paying him $10 million in restitution because he had been a January 6 defendant. He also told the child he would include him in his will so he could receive any remaining money.The report stated: “This tactic was believed to be used to keep [redacted name] from exposing what Andrew had done to him.”January 6 defendants have called for financial compensation, but none have received payments.Johnson had previously pleaded guilty to nonviolent offences linked to the Capitol riot. In 2024, he was sentenced to one year in prison. A sentencing memorandum said prosecutors recommended that sentence because “Johnson climbed over broken glass to enter the US Capitol building through an office window that had been smashed out,” and asked other rioters to follow him inside.He also engaged in “disorderly and disruptive conduct” on Capitol grounds for several hours before being arrested. Prosecutors later alleged that Johnson spread false claims about the riot on social media and called for a second riot a year after his arrest.The memorandum added that “[Johnson] violated his conditions of release on at least ten separate occasions; and has a long criminal history”.Johnson was among roughly 1,500 January 6 defendants pardoned by Trump early in his second term. He is due to be sentenced in March and could face life sentence.","Andrew Paul Johnson was convicted on Tuesday by a jury in Florida of five offences.

What are the new rules for truckers?

Who can get a CDL under the existing rule?





After series of accidents involving migrant, non-English speaking drivers, the Trump administration is rolling out new regulations to keep unqualified foreigners from driving commercial vehicles. New rules will drastically reduce the number of eligible people and will also close the loopholes that now exist between the federal rules and the state rules. Harjinder Singh, Jashanpreet Singh, Rajinder Kumar and Kamalpreet Singh -- all Indian-origin truck drivers -- have been accused of causing fatal crashes on American highways in the past few months. All of them obtained a non-domiciled CDL in California.“For far too long, America has allowed dangerous foreign drivers to abuse our truck licensing systems – wreaking havoc on our roadways,” transportation secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement to Daily Caller. “Moving forward, unqualified foreign drivers will be unable to get a license to operate an 80,000-pound big rig.”“Under President Trump’s leadership, we are putting the safety of the driving public first,” Duffy continued. “From enforcing English language standards to holding fraudulent carriers accountable, we will continue to attack this crisis on our roads head on.”H-2A, H-2B and E-2 nonimmigrant status holders who have undergone federal screening will be eligible for CDL.H-2A visa holders are temporary agricultural workers. H-2B visa holders are termporary non-agriculrural workers. E2 are treaty investors.The new rule also prohibits the acceptance of EADs as proof of eligibility and requires state officials to query the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements system to confirm every foreign applicant’s lawful immigration status.The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration said about 17 fatal crashes that occurred in 2025 “that were caused by actions of non-domiciled CDL holders whose fitness could not be ensured and thus would be ineligible under this new rule.” The agency also accused more than 30 states of improperly issuing non-domiciled CDLs.Non-citizens with any valid work authorization, including Employment Authorization Documents (EADs) such as those held by DACA recipients, asylum seekers, refugees, TPS holders, and others, could apply for a non-domiciled CDL/CLP, as long as they had valid work authorization and immigration documentation.","The Trump administration is rolling out new regulations to keep unqualified foreigners from driving commercial vehicles.

'Surge is leaving state safer': Trump administration ends Minnesota immigration crackdown after months of turmoil,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/surge-is-leaving-state-safer-trump-administration-ends-minnesota-immigration-crackdown-after-months-of-turmoil/articleshow/128267017.cms,"$9 Bn Somali Minnesota Fraud Ignites Fiery Durbin Vs Cornyn Debate On National Security In US Senate





The Trump administration ended an immigration crackdown in Minnesota that led to thousands of arrests, violent protests, and the fatal shootings of two US citizens over the past two months, border czar Tom Homan said Thursday.The US Immigration and Customs Enforcement operation, described as the Department of Homeland Security's “ largest immigration enforcement operation ever ”, focused on the Minneapolis-St. Paul area and resulted in more than 4,000 arrests, Homan said, AP reported.“The surge is leaving Minnesota safer,” he said. “I’ll say it again, it’s less of a sanctuary state for criminals.”The operation became a flashpoint in the debate over President Donald Trump’s mass deportation efforts, flaring up after Renee Good and Alex Pretti were killed by federal officers in Minneapolis. The announcement marked a significant retreat from an operation that became a major distraction for the Trump administration and was more volatile than prior crackdowns in Chicago and Los Angeles.Homan said immigration enforcement would not end when the Minnesota operation was over.“President Trump made a promise of mass deportation and that’s what this country is going to get,” Homan said.Democratic Governor Tim Walz said Tuesday that he expected Operation Metro Surge, which started in December, to end in “days, not weeks and months,” based on his conversations with senior Trump administration officials.While the Trump administration called those arrested in Minnesota “dangerous criminal illegal aliens,” many people with no criminal records, including children and US citizens, were also detained.Homan said last week that 700 federal officers would leave Minnesota immediately, but that still left more than 2,000 on Minnesota’s streets. At the time, he cited an “increase in unprecedented collaboration” resulting in the need for fewer federal officers in Minnesota, including help from jails that hold deportable inmates.Homan said Thursday that the drawdown began this week and will continue next week. He said he planned to stay in Minnesota to oversee the drawdown.Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said Tuesday he had a “positive meeting” with Homan a day earlier and discussed the potential for a further drawdown of federal officers.Homan took over the Minnesota operation in late January after the second fatal shooting by federal immigration agents and amid growing political backlash and questions about how the operation was being run.“We’re very much in a trust but verify mode,” Walz said Tuesday, adding that he expected to hear more from the administration “in the next day or so” about the future of what he said had been an “occupation” and a “retribution campaign” against the state.","Border czar Tom Homan says 4,000 arrests were made in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area.

Tiny needles show how ancient humans made clothes and survived



How early humans stayed warm in the Ice Age







Deep inside the dry caves of Oregon, archaeologists have uncovered something remarkable. Pieces of animal hide stitched together. Using plant fibers and animal hair. It seems to be the oldest sewn hide known in North America. Experts say it dates back more than 12,000 years. Right in the middle of the Ice Age. This find isn’t just about clothing but also hints at survival, adaptation, and ingenuity. How early humans kept warm. How they worked with the materials around them.The discovery comes from Cougar Mountain Cave, with 55 artifacts made from hides, plant fibers, and bones. Some pieces appear sewn, carefully tied and knotted.Some of the finest known from the Late Pleistocene were found at Cougar Mountain and nearby Paisley Caves. They are tiny yet functional. Experts say these needles were used to stitch hides with precision. Plant fibers combined with animal hair created cords and seams that could hold up to harsh conditions. Humans weren’t just making clothing but they were engineering survival.The fragments reportedly include tight-fitted hide pieces that could have been clothing, moccasins, bags, or even parts of shelters. Researchers write that the combination of cordage and hide margins points to intentional tailoring.These weren’t thrown-together rags. They were made to fit, to function, and to endure.Around 12,900 to 11,700 years ago, the Younger Dryas brought a sudden return of cold conditions after a warmer period. Life was harsh, foods was scarce. Experts say clothing was critical. It seems these early humans relied on sewn hides to stay alive. And the artifacts show that even under extreme conditions, they could innovate.The use of fur and stitched hides contrasts with later periods when people shifted to lighter, plant-based textiles as the climate warmed. The transition offers a glimpse into adaptability.Twined fibers, cords, and woven fragments were found alongside the sewn pieces. Experts say this indicates widespread use of fiber technology. Ropes, nets, bags, and even shelter components could be made from plants.","55 artifacts made from hides, plant fibers, and bones have been found in Cougar Mountain Cave, Oregon.

The Supreme Court of Pakistan on Thursday directed authorities to constitute a medical board to assess the health of jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan after reports surfaced about a loss of vision in one of his eyes.A bench comprising Chief Justice Yahya Afridi and Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan also instructed officials to facilitate communication between Khan and his two sons, who live in the United Kingdom with his former wife, British producer and screenwriter Jemima Goldsmith.“The issue of Imran’s health is most important. Intervention is necessary. His phone calls with his son are also important,” Chief Justice Afridi said during the hearing.The order came after the bench resumed hearing a case about the jail conditions of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder-president and ordered a detailed medical check-up before February 16. During the hearing, Attorney General Mansoor Usman Awan said it was the state’s responsibility to provide the former prime minister with medical care.The order also came two days after the court asked PTI leader and lawyer Salman Safdar to meet Khan at Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail, where the cricketer-turned-politician has been held since August 5, 2023, following his conviction in a corruption case.Safdar later submitted his report to the court after meeting Khan. It was the first meeting with the jailed leader since December 2, when his sister, Uzma Khan, was allowed to see him for 20 minutes.Meanwhile, Dawn newspaper, citing the report, noted that it detailed Safdar’s meeting with Khan, the condition of his cell, the facilities provided to him, a description of his living area and the process the lawyer followed to reach the jail.In the report, Safdar quoted Khan as stating that despite receiving treatment, including an injection, he has only 15% vision left in his right eye.Khan reportedly told Safdar that until October 2025, he had normal vision in both eyes. He later began experiencing constant blurred and hazy vision, which he repeatedly reported to the then jail superintendent, but no action was taken.The report added that Khan eventually suffered a sudden and complete loss of vision in his right eye. An eye specialist from Pims Hospital, Dr Muhammad Arif, was then called to examine him.He was diagnosed with a blood clot that caused serious damage. Despite treatment, including an injection, his vision in the right eye remains at only 15 per cent.A day earlier, Safdar denied making any statement about Khan’s health on Tuesday, clarifying that anything attributed to him on the matter had been misrepresented or misreported.However, on the day he met Khan, Safdar told reporters that the jailed leader was “fine and healthy.”","Supreme Court of Pakistan orders medical board to assess Imran Khan's health.

Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif has delivered a scathing assessment of his country’s past alliances with Washington, telling the National Assembly that Islamabad had been “used like toilet paper and then discarded” after serving American interests in Afghanistan.Speaking during a debate on terrorism following a deadly suicide bombing at a Shia mosque in Islamabad, Asif said Pakistan had repeatedly joined “superpower wars” that were never its own.“We took part in two wars that were fought on the soil of Afghanistan,” Asif told lawmakers. Referring to the Soviet intervention in 1979, he claimed it was carried out “at the invitation of the government in Kabul” and that the narrative of an outright invasion was shaped by the United States.Pakistan, he said, entered those conflicts “in the name of Islam and religion”, but in reality two former military dictators sought legitimacy and the backing of a global power.“These were not our wars; they were superpower wars,” he said, adding that Pakistan and its land were used and then discarded ""like toilet paper.""Asif went on to describe terrorism in Pakistan as the “blowback of mistakes committed by dictators in the past”.He added that Pakistan had failed to learn from history, continuing to shift between Washington, Moscow and London in pursuit of short-term interests.""For our own interests, we sometimes turn to Washington, sometimes to Moscow, and sometimes to Britain. We have built strong franchises here, which was not the case 30 or 40 years ago,"" Asif said.Recalling then US President Bill Clinton’s brief stop in Islamabad in 2000, a visit lasting only a few hours at the end of a longer India trip, Asif said it underscored how transactional the relationship had become. Clinton’s engagement with then military ruler Pervez Musharraf was framed by US demands on democracy, non-proliferation and militancy, reinforcing.Asif’s remarks came as parliament passed a resolution condemning the attack on Imambargah Qasr-e-Khadijatul Kubra in Islamabad’s Tarlai area, where a suicide bomber killed 31 people and wounded 169 during Friday prayers. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility. Thousands attended funerals across the capital as grieving families demanded accountability. “What happened yesterday has left us extremely angry and deeply hurt,” said Bushra Rahmani, whose brother was among the wounded.The minister urged political unity, lamenting what he called a lack of consensus even in condemning terrorism. “It is very important that we have a national identity on which no one disagrees,” he said, criticising those who, for political reasons, avoided attending the funerals of victims.","Defence minister Khawaja Asif criticises Pakistan's past alliances with the U.S. and Russia.

‘China no longer trusts us’

Backdrop of deadly Islamabad attack





Pakistan’s Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman on Sunday launched a sharp attack on Pakistan’s handling of militancy and its Afghanistan policy, questioning how extremist elements continue to cross the border even as trade remains blocked.Speaking at a public gathering in Rawalpindi, Rehman highlighted what he described as a glaring contradiction in Islamabad’s approach towards Afghanistan. “In all these decades, we never paused to ask why our Afghan policy failed so miserably. Not a single pomegranate or melon can enter Pakistan, yet terrorists keep crossing the border,” he said, smiling as he made the remark.Referring to repeated claims by Pakistani authorities that militants were entering from Afghanistan, Rehman added, “Authorities say terrorists are coming from there. If they are coming, stop them. If they are coming, eliminate them. The Afghan government has never objected to your actions.”The JUI-F leader also criticised Pakistan’s broader foreign and economic policies, calling them “complete failures”. He said Islamabad’s diplomatic approach had left the country increasingly isolated.“India is our enemy, Afghanistan is our enemy, and even Iran and China are upset with us,” Rehman said, adding that the public deserved answers.“A nation cannot survive when its policies produce only isolation, mistrust and insecurity.”He argued that Pakistan’s foreign policy was being driven not by elected governments but by the military establishment. “One general comes and says we will negotiate; another comes and says we will wage war,” he said.Rehman also took aim at the government’s handling of the China-Pakistan economic corridor (CPEC), claiming that the flagship infrastructure project had stalled due to declining Chinese confidence.“CPEC has seen no real progress during this tenure because China no longer trusts us,” he said, questioning whether “even a single brick” had moved under the current government. He claimed Beijing had expected the Pakistan democratic movement (PDM) government to stabilise relations and revive projects, but remained dissatisfied.Rehman’s remarks come amid heightened tensions following a suicide bombing at a mosque in Islamabad on Friday that killed 69 people and injured more than 170, according to local media reports citing hospital officials. The blast occurred during Friday prayers at Imambargah Qasr-i-Khadijatul Kubra in the Tarlai area, Dawn reported.After Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif suggested on X that preliminary findings pointed to the attacker having travelled to and from Afghanistan, Kabul rejected the allegation. Afghanistan’s ministry of national defence termed the claim “irresponsible and baseless” and urged Pakistani authorities to take responsibility for internal security lapses, Afghan media outlet Ariana News reported.The Afghan ministry said similar accusations had been made in the past following attacks in Balochistan and other parts of Pakistan, without conclusive evidence.","Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman criticises Pakistan’s handling of militancy and its Afghanistan policy.

Pakistan’s decision on granting a licence to Starlink to operate in its satellite internet market has been delayed amid data security concerns, geopolitical sensitivities and competition from Chinese firms, local media reported on Sunday.Starlink, owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk , is among five companies seeking approval to provide satellite-based internet services in Pakistan. However, officials say unresolved security considerations and broader geopolitical factors have slowed the clearance process.According to the Express Tribune, the government has raised concerns that Starlink’s services could allow certain data transmissions to bypass Pakistan’s monitoring, regulatory and safety checks. “We cannot allow a license to Starlink without ensuring a safety check to ensure the safety of the data of consumers in Pakistan,” a senior government official was quoted as saying by Express Tribune.Sources cited by the newspaper said authorities had tested scenarios in which Starlink was expected to pick up sensitive data while providing satellite-based internet services. “But the real reason is that the government has tested some cases in which Starlink was supposed to pick up some sensitive data while providing satellite-based internet services,” sources said.Officials added that the government is working to address these issues, which have delayed the approval process.The report also cited the fallout between US President Donald Trump and Elon Musk as a factor being weighed by the Pakistani establishment. While Trump and Musk had enjoyed a close relationship in the past, they later drifted apart. Officials indicated that Pakistan, which has seen improved ties with the United States since Trump returned to power last year, is cautious about taking steps that could draw scrutiny from Washington.At present, Pakistan maintains control over internet data traffic largely through Pakistan Telecommunication Company Limited, which holds a majority stake in the country’s undersea cable infrastructure. Authorities are concerned that similar oversight may not be feasible with satellite-based services, raising fears of potential data breaches or loss of regulatory control.Satellite internet services are expected to focus primarily on remote and underserved regions, including Balochistan, where conventional broadband infrastructure remains limited. Currently, authorities are able to monitor internet traffic and suspend connectivity when required for security reasons. Officials have expressed concern that enforcing similar controls over satellite-based networks could prove more challenging.The Pakistan Space Activities Regulatory Board has confirmed that five companies, including Starlink and China-based Shanghai Spacecom Satellite Technology Limited, have shown interest in entering the satellite internet market. Chinese firms already have a strong presence in Pakistan’s telecommunications sector and are viewed as direct competitors to US-based companies such as Starlink.While consultations with stakeholders have been completed, the PSARB has yet to finalise the licensing framework. According to officials, additional time is needed to establish safety mechanisms before satellite-based internet services are permitted to begin operations.","Starlink, owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk, is among five companies seeking approval to provide satellite-based internet services in Pakistan.

NEW DELHI: Global terror outfit Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the deadly blast at a Shia mosque in Islamabad that led to over three dozen casualties on Friday. Toll rose to 36 on Saturday after some critically injured people died in hospitals, said a PTI report.In a related development that has attracted the attention of Indian security establishment, the Islamic State in its latest al-Naba issue called on members of Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) to defect and join the Islamic State in Khorasan Province.The claim regarding the blast was issued via IS central's mouthpiece, Amaq, stating the attack was a Fidayeen operation carried out by a soldier of the Islamic State in Pakistan Province (ISPP) -- active since 2019 -- inside the mosque compound. Amaq claimed over 200 casualties in contrast to the official Pak govt admission of 36 deaths and injuries to scores.The suicide bomber was identified by Amaq as Saifullah Ansari. His photograph taking the bayah (oath of allegiance) was also posted by the IS mouthpiece. The statement also mentioned that hundreds of Pakistani Shias had joined the pro-Iran 'Zaynabiyoun brigade' militia in Syria.The claim by Amaq followed an official denial by Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which strongly rebutted any involvement in the incident.The blast, which occurred during prayers at the Khadijatul Kubra mosque in Tarlai area, was the deadliest in Islamabad since the 2008 Marriott hotel bombing.The explosion coincided with the visit of Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev to Pakistan. The attack is being seen as a result of growing sectarian tensions in the country.Earlier in Jan, ISKP had claimed responsibility for a blast in Bajaur district that killed a senior Lashkar commander named Najibullah.","Global terror outfit Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the deadly blast at a Shia mosque in Islamabad that led to over three dozen casualties on Friday.

'Home-Grown Ills': Islamabad Mosque Blast Triggers Blame Game As India Rejects Pakistan's Blame





The Islamic State on Saturday claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing at a Shiite mosque in Islamabad, which killed at least 36 people and injured many others.In a statement released through its Amaq News Agency, the Islamic State in Pakistan, an offshoot of Daesh, said the bomber opened fire at security guards when they tried to stop him at the entrance and then exploded inside among worshippers.The group also said Shiite Muslims in Pakistan were a target, claiming they provided recruits to militias fighting the Islamic State in Syria.The blast took place on Friday at the Khadijatul Kubra mosque-cum-shrine in the Tarlie area of the capital. The attacker, identified as 32-year-old Yasir from Peshawar, entered the mosque while worshippers were offering weekly prayers and detonated explosives.Authorities in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province said they arrested four suspects, including three alleged facilitators and the mastermind, during intelligence-based raids in Peshawar and Nowshera.Investigators said an identity card recovered during the probe confirmed the attacker’s identity. Official records showed his permanent address in Abbas Colony on Charsadda Road in Peshawar.Officials also said the attacker had spent around five months in Afghanistan before the bombing, where he allegedly received training in weapons handling and suicide attacks.Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif had earlier claimed that India and Afghanistan were involved in the attack, without presenting any evidence.India had strongly rejected the allegations, saying, ""It is unfortunate that, instead of seriously addressing the problems plaguing its social fabric, Pakistan should choose to delude itself by blaming others for its home-grown ills. India rejects any and every such allegation, which is as baseless as it is pointless.""","The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing at a Shiite mosque in Islamabad.

Signals from Washington and Tehran





Pakistan has been invited to participate in upcoming talks between Iran and the United States aimed at easing tensions between the two countries, slated to take place on Friday in Turkey.“Pakistan has received the invitation for the upcoming talks between Iran and the United States,” Pakistan foreign office spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said while responding to a query, reported Dawn.Pakistan's deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar is expected to take part in the meeting, the daily reported citing a diplomatic source, adding that “Islamabad’s participation was seen as significant.”An Arab official told AFP on condition of anonymity that the meeting is likely to be held in Turkiye on Friday. The format of the talks remains unclear, though the official said the main meeting would take place that day.A regional official told Reuters that the priority of the talks was to avoid conflict and de-escalate tensions between Iran and the US, adding that several regional powers had been invited at the foreign ministers’ level.According to the official, countries invited include Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Egypt, Oman and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).US outlet Axios, citing two sources and a US official, reported that Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi was expected to meet US envoy Steve Witkoff in Istanbul to discuss a possible agreement related to Iran’s nuclear programme.Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian confirmed on Tuesday that he had instructed Araghchi to pursue “fair and equitable negotiations” in an environment “free from threats and unreasonable expectations”.The talks, he said in posts on X, would be held “within the framework of our national interests”.US President Donald Trump has said he is hopeful Washington would “work something out” with Iran but warned on Monday that “bad things would happen” if no deal was reached.In an interview with CNN on Sunday, Araghchi said: “President Trump said no nuclear weapons, and we fully agree. We fully agree with that. That could be a very good deal.”“In return, we expect sanctions to be lifted,” he added, while warning that Iran was prepared for war if talks failed, saying any conflict would likely spread beyond Iran.Turkiye has been leading diplomatic efforts to defuse tensions, with Araghchi visiting Istanbul last week and engaging with regional counterparts, including in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan.Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia and the UAE have assured Tehran that they would not allow their airspace or territory to be used for military action against Iran, while Jordan has said it would not act as a “launching pad” for any such action.","Pakistan has been invited to participate in upcoming talks between Iran and the United States.

Imran Khan’s Sisters Allege Illegal Isolation, Stage Protest Outside Adiala Jail





A Pakistani anti-terrorism court (ATC) on Tuesday issued non-bailable arrest warrants against Aleema Khan, sister of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan in connection with a protest held in Islamabad in November 2024.According to news agency PTI citing a media report, the warrants were issued by the ATC in Rawalpindi after Aleema Khan failed to appear before the court despite earlier directions.The court also issued non-bailable arrest warrants against her two guarantors and ordered that all three be arrested and produced before it on Wednesday, without fail. Aleema’s application seeking exemption from personal appearance was rejected.The case, registered at Sadiqabad Police Station, relates to a protest at D-Chowk in Islamabad on November 24, 2024 and includes charges of protesting against the government, chanting anti-government slogans, vandalism and stone-pelting. ATC Judge Amjad Ali Shah conducted the hearing.The court also issued a show-cause notice to the Superintendent of Police (SP), Rawal, for failing to execute the arrest warrants.The SP has been directed to appear before the court on Wednesday and explain why Aleema Khan was not arrested and presented despite clear orders, according to Pakistani news website Express Tribune.During Monday’s hearing, Aleema Khan’s defence counsel sought a one-day exemption, citing difficulties in travel and daily affairs after her bank accounts, Computerised National Identity Card and passport were reportedly blocked. The court, however, did not accept the plea.The proceedings have drawn attention as Aleema Khan had earlier skipped multiple hearings in the case and appeared only after the court issued property seizure orders and several arrest warrants. She is among those nominated as accused in protest-related cases filed following the November demonstrations.The protest followed Imran Khan’s “final call” for nationwide demonstrations demanding the restoration of the party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) electoral mandate, the release of party leaders and the reversal of constitutional changes.The D-Chowk protest ended on November 26 after a security operation, with several cases registered across Rawalpindi district.

'Physically handicapped': Khawaja Asif's brutal admission as Pakistan forces battle BLA,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/physically-handicapped-khawaja-asifs-brutal-admission-as-pakistan-forces-battling-bla-in-balochistan/articleshow/127880579.cms,"Balochistan Crisis: Pakistan-Origin Commentator Takes Apart Islamabad, Exposes Lies On India

Troops ‘physically handicapped’ by vast terrain

Insurgency background and wider fallout





Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif said the country’s security forces are “physically handicapped” by the sheer size of Balochistan as they battle a fresh surge in militant violence, after authorities reported killing 177 insurgents in sweeping counter-terror operations across the province.Addressing the national assembly, Asif described the scale of the challenge facing troops deployed in Pakistan’s largest and least populated province, where coordinated attacks triggered one of the deadliest security crises in recent years. His remarks came after militants launched simultaneous assaults in multiple towns, targeting civilians, homes and security installations.“Balochistan constitutes over 40 per cent of Pakistan geographically...To control it is much more difficult than a populated city, and it needs deployment of massive forces. Our troops are deployed there and are in action against them (terrorists), but they are physically handicapped by guarding and patrolling such a big area,” Asif told lawmakers, as quoted by PTI.Security officials said the death toll of militants had risen to 177 in the past two days following large-scale raids and gun battles.The operations were launched after insurgents carried out coordinated attacks at 12 locations, with authorities confirming that at least 17 police and security personnel were killed, along with dozens of civilians.Asif said the weekend violence claimed 33 civilian lives and 17 members of the security forces. He ruled out talks with the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), saying no negotiations would be held with “terrorists” responsible for killing civilians, including women and children.Balochistan, which borders Iran and Afghanistan, has long faced a separatist insurgency driven by ethnic Baloch groups who accuse the central government of discrimination and exploitation. Authorities say groups such as the BLA have targeted security forces, infrastructure and projects linked to the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor.Train services between Balochistan and the rest of Pakistan remained suspended for a third day, while mobile and internet services were cut in several districts during clean-up operations. Provincial officials said services were expected to resume once the security situation stabilised.Asif dismissed claims that Balochistan had been neglected, saying the province had seen development, including multiple airports. He also rejected the “missing persons” narrative, alleging that names of militants killed in operations had appeared on such lists. “This narrative has been concocted. I also used to support this cause and protest over it. But, terrorists and criminal elements have hijacked all these narratives,” he said.","Khawaja Asif says security forces are 'physically handicapped' by sheer size of Balochistan.

In a bizarre case, police in Pakistan’s Rawalpindi district registered a case on Sunday of abduction against a “jinn” (supernatural spirit) following the disappearance of an 11-year-old boy, news agency ANI reported, citing ARY News.The incident occurred in the garrison city when the boy went missing from his home on January 21. After ten days without any sign of the child, his father approached the Taxila Police Station and filed a First Information Report (FIR).In the FIR, the father alleged that supernatural entities, known locally as jinns, had forced his son to run away.The complainant said that this is not the first time such an incident has occurred. He added that the jinns had “abducted” his son several times before.He highlighted that while the boy had returned home after previous incidents, this time ten days had passed without his return, prompting him to formally accuse the supernatural spirits of kidnapping.According to ARY News, similar claims have been reported in Pakistan’s legal system before. In Lahore, a mother had lodged a case against jinns over the disappearance of her married daughter, a matter that eventually reached the courts.A report by Dawn in September stated that a special investigation team of Lahore police was formed under the directions of the city's high court Chief Justice Aalia Neelam to probe the six-year-old case of the missing woman, believed to have been abducted by a jinn.The team, headed by Lahore Investigation DIG Zeeshan Raza, was tasked with locating and recovering the woman.","11-year-old boy went missing from his home in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, on January 21.

‘Not a time for celebration’

Jamaat candidate alleges foul play

Peaceful polls?

‘Must remain united in the greater national interest’

‘Well-planned farce’





The Bangladesh Nationalist Party is heading for an overwhelming majority in the parliamentary elections in Bangladesh held since a deadly 2024 uprising.According to the latest trends, Tarique Rahman-led BNP, along with its alliance parties, is leading in 212 out of 299 seats in parliament, while the Jamaat-e-Islami-led alliance is ahead in 70 seats.BNP chairman Rahman , who has won from both constituencies he contested — Bogra and Dhaka-17 — would likely take over as the next Prime Minister.Official results have not yet been delivered by the Bangladesh Election Commission, which is expected to issue its announcement on Friday.Claiming victory, BNP election committee spokesperson Mahdi Amin told reporters the party was on track to win at least two-thirds of seats.“Buoyed by strong public support, the BNP will secure a two-thirds majority and form the government,” Amin said, adding that party chief Tarique Rahman had won both seats he contested.Meanwhile, BNP chairman Tarique Rahman requested that celebrations be postponed out of respect for the passing of his mother, Khaleda Zia, before the election. The party called for prayers for Khaleda Zia after the Friday congregational prayer.“This victory was expected. It is not surprising that the people of Bangladesh have placed their trust in a party capable of realising the dreams that our youth envisioned during the uprising,” said Salahuddin Ahmed, a senior BNP committee member.“This is not a time for celebration, as we will face mounting challenges in building a country free from discrimination,” he added.Meanwhile, Jamaat-e-Islami alleged discrepancies in voting in certain places.Addressing mediapersons, Khaleduz Zaman, a Jamaat-e-Islami candidate running against Tarique Rahman, said, “The situation is not good because without a polling agent, in a separate room, someone is sealing the papers.”“It is totally disappointing. I have seen this in some places. We were hopeful that Jamaat-e-Islami would win the election, but if this happens, how can we have hopes,” he added.BNP workers spent the whole night outside party offices.“We will join the nation-building effort led by Tarique Rahman,” Md Fazlur Rahman, 45, told AFP. “Over the last 17 years, we have suffered a lot, faced multiple politically motivated cases and lost a factory I owned.”However, according to police reports, political clashes killed five people and injured more than 600 during campaigning.Polling day was largely peaceful, according to the Election Commission, which reported only “a few minor disruptions”.Chief adviser Muhammad Yunus, who will step down once the new government takes power, urged all sides to stay calm.“We may have differences of opinion, but we must remain united in the greater national interest,” he said.The 85-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner has led Bangladesh since the ouster of Sheikh Hasina in August 2024.His administration barred her Bangladesh Awami League from contesting the polls.After casting his vote, Yunus said the country had “ended the nightmare and begun a new dream”.The Bangladesh Awami League rejected the parliamentary election as a “well-planned farce,” claiming that the vote, conducted without the party’s participation, disregarded democratic norms and the Constitution.In a statement posted on its X handle after polling concluded and counting began, the party expressed gratitude to citizens — including mothers, sisters and minority communities — for rejecting what it called a “voter-less” election.The Awami League alleged that the farcical polling began on the evening of 11 February with seizure of polling centres, gunfire, distribution of cash, vote-buying, stamping of ballots and agents signing result sheets without voter participation.By 11 am on 12 February, just three and a half hours into voting, only 14.96% of eligible voters had reportedly participated, according to the Election Commission, while many polling stations — particularly in Dhaka and other major areas — had no voters at all.The party further claimed that in the days leading up to the election, its supporters, voters and minority communities faced continuous intimidation, arrests and attacks aimed at forcing compliance.","The Bangladesh Nationalist Party is heading for an overwhelming majority in the parliamentary elections in Bangladesh held since a deadly 2024 uprising.

According to BNP, Kochi had gone to vote when he opposed campaigning inside the center. Members of the rival Jamaat allegedly pushed him, causing him to fall and hit his head. He was later taken to a hospital, where the doctor on duty declared him dead.Metropolitan BNP media cell convener Mizanur Rahman said that Kochi had gone to the Khulna Alia Madrasa center to vote in the morning.

He was later taken to a private medical college hospital, where doctors declared him dead.Jamaat’s center director Mahbubur Rahman offered a different version, saying, “BNP people were expelling our female workers.I stopped them.

Bangladesh is voting in its first general election since a student-led uprising toppled Sheikh Hasina’s 15-year rule in August 2024. What began as protests over public sector job quotas spiralled into the deadliest political violence since independence, leaving more than 1,000 people dead and dismantling one of South Asia’s most entrenched political orders.Now 127 million voters in the Muslim-majority nation of 170 million people are electing 350 lawmakers — 300 directly and 50 reserved for women — in what European Union observers have described as the “biggest democratic process of 2026, anywhere”. More than 50 parties and over 2,000 candidates are in the fray.The immediate trigger was a student protest movement in July 2024. Within weeks it evolved into a nationwide revolt against Hasina’s government. Security crackdowns intensified tensions, and by early August the prime minister resigned and fled to India.The fallout was seismic. The once-dominant Awami League was later barred from contesting the election, fundamentally reshaping the political landscape and ending the two-party duopoly that had defined Bangladesh for decades.Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus, 85, returned from exile to head a caretaker administration.He described the system he inherited as “completely broken” and promised a democratic reset.Yunus has said the interim government would “hand over the responsibility to the newly elected government with deep pleasure and pride”. Alongside the parliamentary vote, citizens are also deciding in a referendum whether to adopt sweeping constitutional reforms aimed at limiting prime-ministerial power and strengthening judicial independence.The so-called July National Charter includes proposals for term limits for the prime minister, a new upper house of parliament, enhanced presidential powers and greater judicial autonomy.Supporters argue the reforms are necessary to prevent a return to one-party dominance. Critics, particularly among student activists, say the charter must have constitutional backing to carry real weight. The referendum result could shape Bangladesh’s political architecture for decades.The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), led by 60-year-old Tarique Rahman , is widely tipped to win. Rahman returned in December after 17 years in self-imposed exile, energising party supporters.“We expect that we will have a clear mandate from the people,” he said ahead of polling. Campaigning on restoring security and reviving a struggling economy, Rahman has warned that “the economy has been destroyed” and pledged to create jobs for young people.Opinion polls vary sharply, but most place the BNP ahead — though sometimes by narrow margins.Jamaat-e-Islami, once marginalised and banned from elections, has re-emerged as a serious contender after a Supreme Court ruling restored its registration in 2025.Its leader, Shafiqur Rahman, has sought to soften the party’s image, focusing on anti-corruption and welfare. “We want to build a country of unity with everyone on board,” he said during campaigning. If successful, Jamaat could help shape the first Islamist-influenced government in constitutionally secular Bangladesh.Sheikh Hasina, 78, was sentenced to death in absentia for crimes against humanity linked to the 2024 crackdown and remains in India. Her Awami League has been barred from contesting — a decision condemned by rights groups.Hasina has warned that elections without her party risk “sowing the seeds” of division. In the January 2024 vote, widely criticised by opponents as a sham, the Awami League secured 222 seats amid low turnout. This time, its absence has opened political space — but also intensified polarisation.Bangladesh has a long history of military intervention, and the armed forces remain influential. More than 300,000 security personnel have been deployed nationwide.Rights group Ain o Salish Kendra reported 158 people killed and over 7,000 injured in political violence between August 2024 and December 2025. Police records show five deaths and more than 600 injuries during the campaign period alone.UN experts warned of “growing intolerance, threats and attacks” and a “tsunami of disinformation”, particularly targeting first-time voters.This election marks a generational shift. With a median age of about 25, millions are voting for the first time. Many were too young to participate during Hasina’s 15 years in power.“This was my first vote and I hope after everything we went through the last few years, now is the time for something positive,” said Shithi Goswami, 21, after casting her ballot in Dhaka. Voter turnout is expected to be significantly higher than the roughly 25% recorded in January 2024.The outcome carries strategic implications beyond Bangladesh’s borders. Relations with India, once Hasina’s closest partner, have cooled. Yunus’ first official visit was to China, signalling a possible recalibration, while engagement with Pakistan has also deepened.Professor Harsh V. Pant of the Observer Research Foundation believes pragmatism will prevail. “Whoever comes to power in Bangladesh is likely to be pragmatic in its engagement with both India and China,” he said, arguing that balancing both powers is a strategic necessity.For India, connectivity and border security are central. For China, infrastructure investments are at stake. For Pakistan, shifts in Dhaka could open diplomatic space.Counting is conducted by hand after polls close, with results expected to trickle in over several hours. Alongside parliamentary outcomes, the referendum result will indicate whether voters endorse structural political reform.As Yunus told the nation before voting: “It will determine the future direction of the country, the character of its democracy, its durability, and the fate of the next generation.”","Bangladesh is voting in its first general election since a student-led uprising toppled Sheikh Hasina’s 15-year rule in August 2024. 127 million voters in the Muslim-majority nation of 170 million people are electing 350 lawmakers in what EU observers have described as the “biggest democratic process of 2026, anywhere” More than 50 parties and over 2,000 candidates are in the fray.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128237693,imgsize-1187290,width-400,resizemode-4/ap-photo.jpg"

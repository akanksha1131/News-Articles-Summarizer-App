Libya’s army chief, Lt Gen Mohamed Al-Haddad, was killed in a plane crash while returning to Tripoli from an official visit to Turkey, the country’s prime minister said on Tuesday.Prime Minister Abdulhamid al-Dbeibah confirmed that Al-Haddad died along with four others in a “tragic accident” during the flight home from Ankara. The crash occurred after the aircraft lost contact shortly after take-off from Turkey’s capital.“With great sadness and sorrow, we have received the news of the death of Lt Gen Al-Haddad and his companions,” al-Dbeibah said in a statement. He offered condolences to the families of the victims and said the loss was a tragedy for Libya and its military institution, as reported by CNN.The prime minister identified the other victims as Maj Gen Al-Fitouri Ghreibel, Chief of Staff of the Ground Forces; Brig Gen Mahmoud Al-Qatioui, Director of the Military Manufacturing Authority; Mohamed Al-Asawi Diab, adviser to the army chief and media office photographer Mohamed Omar Ahmed Mahjoub.Turkish authorities said they lost contact with the Falcon 50 business jet shortly after it departed Ankara Esenboga Airport at around 8.10 pm (local time).Turkey’s interior minister Ali Yerlikaya said contact was lost at 8.52 pm after the aircraft sent an emergency landing notification near the Haymana district, about 50 miles southwest of Ankara.Turkish broadcaster CNNTurk reported that the jet had declared an electrical emergency and requested to return to the airport before communication was lost. The aircraft reportedly had a crew of three, all French nationals.Turkey’s justice minister Yilmaz Tunc said a full investigation has been launched into the crash and that authorities will examine “all aspects of the incident with great care.”Earlier on Tuesday, Turkey’s armed forces said Lt Gen Al-Haddad had been formally received in Ankara with a military ceremony as an official guest. He later held talks with Turkish Chief of the General Staff Gen Selcuk Bayraktaroglu as part of his official visit.","Libya's army chief Lt Gen Mohamed Al-Haddad was killed in a plane crash while returning to Tripoli from an official visit to Turkey.

Candace Owens criticizes Turning Point USA’s Charlie Kirk tent display after Erika Kirk meeting





Candace Owens is again speaking out against Turning Point USA, even after a long private meeting with its new leader, Erika Kirk. Owens made her views clear on December 22, 2025, when she shared strong words online about the group’s recent event in Phoenix. She openly agreed with comments made by comedian Tim Dillon, who called TPUSA’s event a “bad reality show.”Owens said the group now feels out of touch with regular people. She also questioned TPUSA’s choice to recreate a tent linked to the death of its founder, Charlie Kirk. Even though Candace Owens and Erika Kirk met face to face earlier this month and called the talk “honest” and “productive,” Owens’ latest comments show the bigger fight is not over. Her message is clear. The meeting helped with personal tension, but it did not change her views on how TPUSA is being run.The latest fight centers on a tent shown at America Fest, a four-day TPUSA event that started on December 19, 2025, in Phoenix, Arizona. TPUSA placed a full-size copy of the tent where Charlie Kirk was killed while speaking at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah, on September 10, 2025. The tent was part of Charlie Kirk’s well-known “Prove Me Wrong” booth.Owens reacted strongly. On X, she backed Tim Dillon’s comments from a podcast released two days earlier. Dillon said the event felt staged and focused on taking money from supporters.Candace Owens wrote, “Everyone was thinking it, Tim Dillon said it. It was out of touch and elite.” She added, “It is not and will never be relatable for blue collar workers to endure lectures from wealthy people telling them who is and is not evil.”She also questioned the tent itself, writing, “Recreating the tent Charlie died under for selfies? Seriously?”TPUSA supporters pushed back online. Some said the tent was meant to honor Kirk’s mission, not his death. Conservative commentator Karen Hamilton said the display showed Kirk’s goal to “challenge error with truth” on college campuses.This public clash comes just days after Owens met Erika Kirk on December 15, 2025. The meeting lasted more than four hours. Before it happened, Erika Kirk said both sides would pause public talk.After the meeting, Erika Kirk said the discussion was positive. Owens agreed and said, “Absolutely nothing was held back.” She also said they agreed on more points than she expected. Still, Owens’ new comments show she remains unhappy with TPUSA’s direction. As of late December 2025, Erika Kirk has not replied to Candace Owens’ latest remarks.Also Read: “I Pray For Her”: Erika Kirk Breaks Silence On Candace Owens Meeting And Says She Is Done With The Noise","Candace Owens is again speaking out against Turning Point USA, even after a long private meeting with its new leader, Erika Kirk.

‘My interviewer wasn’t even human’: Job seeker shares bizarre interview experience with AI avatar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/etimes/trending/my-interviewer-wasnt-even-human-job-seeker-shares-bizarre-interview-experience-with-ai-avatar/articleshow/126145453.cms,"AI representative Image

“My interviewer wasn’t even human”

“Five minutes in, I realised my candidate wasn’t human”



“What is AI?”

“So yeah. Not just fake resumes anymore. Fake candidates are now literally joining interviews.

Recruiting hell has officially entered the uncanny valley.”

A line quietly crossed





Artificial intelligence has already taken over large parts of modern hiring. Algorithms scan CVs, software ranks candidates, and automated systems now replace junior recruiters and even some of the engineers who once built them. CV screening, shortlisting and candidate ranking are now routinely automated. What has largely remained untouched, until now, is the interview: a human candidate speaking to a human interviewer in real time. That assumption is starting to fray, not through corporate announcements, but through unsettling first-hand accounts from people who believed they were speaking to real humans.In one account posted on Reddit, in the r/interviews subreddit, a job applicant described receiving a routine email invitation for an online interview. The link worked as expected. The video loaded. On screen was a woman who smiled, nodded, and began asking questions.At first, nothing seemed unusual.As the interview continued, the candidate noticed her head movements repeating in a way that felt unnatural. Small facial twitches appeared every few seconds. The applicant assumed it was a poor internet connection and carried on.When the conversation moved into substantive questions, the delivery stood out.“There was no hesitation. No ‘uh’. No pauses,” the user wrote.The interviewer responded instantly to every answer, with polished, perfectly structured language. Curious, the candidate asked a question back: “Why do you think this role matters?”The response came immediately. It was fluent, confident, and, in the user’s words, “textbook-perfect”.The candidate asked the same question again. The answer was identical. Same wording. Same cadence.They asked a third time.The response did not change.Shortly afterwards, the screen froze briefly. When the video resumed, the interviewer continued speaking as if nothing had happened.The candidate ended the post by questioning whether companies should be allowed to conduct interviews using AI avatars without disclosure, writing: “I’m not against AI in hiring, but if an interviewer is basically a talking bot, shouldn’t candidates at least be told?”The post sparked hundreds of comments, many expressing concern about transparency in recruitment and how easily AI could now pass as human in a professional setting.It is not only employers experimenting with automation. Some candidates, too, have turned to clever technological workarounds to get a foot in the door.In a separate but closely related account posted to r/recruiting, the experience unfolded from the other side of the interview.The poster said they were interviewing candidates for an AI engineering role and joined a video call expecting a routine screening. Almost immediately, they noticed something off about the candidate’s movements.“This person’s head moves a lot when they talk,” the recruiter wrote. “Weirdly repetitive. It is not natural. It is almost looping.”The recruiter continued the interview, assuming camera lag. Then the candidate began speaking uninterrupted for nearly two minutes.“No pauses. No filler words. Just continuous, textbook-perfect talking.”To test the situation, the recruiter asked a basic question:The response came back scripted. When the question was repeated, the answer was identical. The third attempt produced the same result. Shortly after, the call disconnected.According to the recruiter, HR later confirmed what had happened. The real candidate had joined briefly at the beginning of the call to introduce themselves. After that, an AI agent had taken over the interview.“It even looked almost identical to the person’s LinkedIn photo,” the recruiter wrote.They concluded bluntly:Even if this is not yet a formal or widespread practice, it fits squarely with the direction hiring has been moving in. Tasks once handled by people are increasingly outsourced to systems designed to simulate them, often well enough to pass without challenge. Interviews have long been one of the few remaining points of genuine human contact in recruitment. These accounts suggest that boundary is starting to blur.What makes the moment unsettling is not just that AI can now mimic faces, voices and conversational rhythm, but that it is learning to do so rapidly. Voice modulation tools already erase tell-tale pauses. Visual generators can produce lifelike faces that hold up under casual scrutiny. Behavioural models are improving at replicating imperfection itself. For now, repetition gives them away. Soon, even that may not.",Recruiting hell has officially entered the uncanny valley. Fake candidates are now literally joining interviews. Interviews have been outsourced to systems designed to simulate them.

Her remarks, made during a feud with Ben Shapiro, have sparked concerns about hate speech and the spread of conspiracy theories online, with critics deeming her comments dangerous and harmful.

Candace Owens’ remarks are being called dangerous by critics across the political spectrum





Candace Owens is facing intense criticism after a recent episode of her YouTube show ignited outrage across political and religious communities. During the broadcast, the conservative commentator encouraged viewers to read a notorious 19th-century antisemitic text and made sweeping claims about Jewish involvement in historical atrocities.The remarks came amid her ongoing feud with Daily Wire co-founder Ben Shapiro and followed renewed attention on her departure from the conservative media outlet. The episode has since fueled concern about misinformation, hate speech, and the growing influence of conspiracy-driven commentary online.Owens’ comments centered on Der Talmudjude, a discredited antisemitic book written by German theologian August Rohling. Holding up the text on her show, she told viewers, “I encourage other people at home to learn what is in that Talmud so that you know what Ben thinks of you,” before adding, “He doesn’t just hate me, he hates you, too, white men. He hates all black people.”She went further, accusing Jews of manipulating racial conflict and controlling the transatlantic slave trade, statements widely rejected by historians. “Wake up and learn the true history of slavery because that wasn’t exactly a white man’s sport,” Owens said.“Jewish people were the ones who were trading with us. Jewish people were in control of the slave trade.”Owens also accused Shapiro of acting as a “contract lord” and claimed he followed values that dehumanize others, stating, “They think that we’re animals, that they have a right to own us, make us worship them, lie to us, sue us, take everything that we have, and deceive us.”The episode escalated existing tensions tied to conspiracy theories surrounding the death of Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk. Shapiro publicly condemned Owens’ rhetoric, saying influential voices have a “moral obligation” to reject what he described as “specious and evil attacks.”Advocacy groups and critics argue that Owens’ remarks recycle long-debunked antisemitic tropes, warning that such narratives risk fueling real-world harm under the guise of political dissent.Also Read: “The real monsters”: Rob Schneider blasts Candace Owens and Nick Fuentes, warns conservatives at TPUSA’s AmFest","Conservative commentator Candace Owens is facing intense criticism after a recent episode of her YouTube show ignited outrage across political and religious communities.

“Hella shady”: Perez Hilton slams Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s Archewell rebrand as charity faces harsh scrutiny,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us-streamers/hella-shady-perez-hilton-slams-prince-harry-and-meghan-markles-archewell-rebrand-as-charity-faces-harsh-scrutiny/articleshow/126150380.cms,"Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's Archewell Foundation has rebranded to Archewell Philanthropies, sparking scrutiny over its operational structure and finances. Critics, including Perez Hilton, question the shift to a fiscal sponsor model and highlight a significant imbalance between expenses and grants awarded, raising concerns about transparency and the foundation's charitable impact.

Why the Archewell Philanthropies rebrand is raising eyebrows beyond its new name

Blake Lively's Losing! Meghan Markle Exposed! Heated Rivalry Fans Go Too Far! And More HOT TOPICS!





Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s philanthropic brand is once again under the spotlight, this time following a quiet but significant rebrand. On its fifth anniversary, the couple announced that the Archewell Foundation would now operate under the name Archewell Philanthropies.Although the Sussexes positioned the change as a natural extension of their family-run charity agenda, critics were quick to wonder what actually behind-the-scenes changed. It was further scrutinized when Perez Hilton came out publicly to question the structure, finances, and transparency of the foundation, stirring anew the controversy surrounding the manner in which celebrity-driven nonprofits are operated.According to the foundation’s website, the rebrand is meant to allow Prince Harry, Meghan Markle, and their children to “expand upon their global philanthropic endeavors as a family.” However, Hilton argued that the transformation goes deeper than branding. On his podcast, he revealed that Archewell has shifted to a fiscal sponsor model, which he believes fundamentally alters how the organization operates.“That sounds hella shady to me. If I was a really, really rich person, I would not be donating to Archewell Philanthropies,” Hilton said, adding, “What if there's some nefarious going on?”While fiscal sponsorship is a legal and common nonprofit structure, Hilton questioned whether it truly aligns with the Sussexes’ public image of hands-on philanthropy.He further pointed to financial disclosures that show a sharp imbalance between spending and giving.“And here's the shadiest part… They had expenses of over $5 million. They took in over $2.1 million in donations, and they only gave out $1.25 million in grants. The math ain't mathing,” he said.Hilton also criticized reported layoffs and employee bonuses during what he described as a weak financial year, calling the rebrand “a disaster waiting to happen.” With public records showing a drastically reduced staff, critics argue the new name raises more questions than confidence, especially for a foundation tied so closely to global celebrity and influence.Also Read: “A horrible human being”: Perez Hilton accuses Nicki Minaj of getting a hefty paycheck after her praise of TPUSA AmFest","Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's Archewell Foundation has rebranded to Archewell Philanthropies.

Why was Carter Efe suspended on Twitch? Record-breaking African streamer faced four-month ban after historic Davido livestream,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us-streamers/why-is-carter-efe-suspended-on-twitch-record-breaking-african-streamer-faces-four-month-ban-after-historic-davido-livestream/articleshow/126150355.cms,"African digital culture's celebrated moment turned sour as Nigerian Twitch star Carter Efe received a four-month ban just after setting viewership records. The platform cited Terms of Service violations without specifics, sparking fan speculation. Despite the setback, Efe swiftly moved to YouTube, proving his influence transcends single platforms and highlighting creator challenges with growing visibility.

What the Twitch suspension means for Carter Efe’s fast-growing digital empire





The popularity of Carter Efe on Twitch was not just a victory over African digital culture. Rather, it has gone in a different direction. Only days after being named the most-followed twitch streamer in Africa and establishing new-viewing records, the Nigerian viral phenomenon was suspended by the platform for four months.The timing has caused confusion and debate as the ban was received when his visibility in the world was at its peak. As Twitch does not provide a lot of explanations, it has emerged as a point of discussion on the topic of platform regulations, creator-critiques, and the popularity of African streamers on the global scene.The suspension was due to what Twitch termed as inaccurate approaches to its Terms of Service and Community Guidelines, however, no particular event was publicly named. That ambiguity has left fans guessing whether the problem was associated with action during his livestream with Davido where he went viral, mass reporting, or increased moderation after the record-breaking moment.What is more remarkable about the ban is the magnitude of the accomplishment of Carter Efe. His December live stream attracted about 83,000 live watchers making it the most viewed stream by an African on Twitch.It also propelled him through several milestones such as the 405, 000+ followers and over 20, 000 subscribers, which are figures hardly ever witnessed on the continent on the platform.Instead of decreasing the pace, suspension seems to have required a tactical turn. Loyalty of his fanbase was secured as Carter Efe hastily transferred to YouTube , where his first livestreaming garnered thousands of simultaneous viewers. The relocation is one of the signals of a larger movement of creators who do not wish to keep relying on a single platform.In addition to a ban, the episode highlights the pressure creators have to manage when their viewers increase. In the case of Carter Efe, the Twitch freeze can be a momentary, but his swift recovery indicates that he is more than just any application.","Nigerian Twitch star Carter Efe received a four-month ban just after setting viewership records.

US diplomacy shakeup? Trump recalls 30 career diplomats from ambassadorial embassy posts; here's why,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-diplomacy-shakeup-trump-recalls-30-career-diplomats-from-ambassadorial-embassy-posts-heres-why/articleshow/126133146.cms,"(File photo)

Trump Immigration Offensive SHOCK Reveal; Workplace Raids, Expanded Detention Incoming Next Year

An ‘unprecedented’ recall of career ambassadors

White House defence and ‘America First’ rationale





The Trump administration has quietly ordered the recall of nearly 30 career diplomats serving as ambassadors and chiefs of mission across the world, triggering alarm within the US foreign service and renewed accusations of a political purge inside the State Department. The move, reported by various US media outlets, is highly unusual and has not been publicly announced by the administration.Those affected are all career Foreign Service officers who were nominated during the Biden administration and confirmed by the Senate. Unlike political appointees, career ambassadors are typically retained across changes in government to preserve continuity and maintain an apolitical diplomatic corps. Many were told abruptly, often by phone, to vacate their posts by mid-January, with no explanation provided.The mass recall comes even as President Donald Trump has repeatedly said he wants to resolve global conflicts through diplomacy, raising questions about the impact on US influence abroad.According to the American Foreign Service Association (AFSA), the union representing US diplomats, this is the first time such a large group of career ambassadors has been recalled simultaneously.AFSA said it had received “credible reports” from diplomatic posts worldwide that senior envoys had been directed to return to Washington within weeks.Former diplomats described the process as chaotic and opaque. One former senior official said ambassadors were being pulled “randomly”, with no clarity on why some were recalled while others were spared. AFSA warned that the lack of transparency broke sharply with long-standing norms and sent a troubling signal to both allies and public servants.Africa has been the hardest-hit region, with roughly a dozen ambassadors recalled from countries including Nigeria, Senegal, Uganda, Rwanda, Niger and Somalia. Other recalls have affected posts in Europe, the Middle East and Eurasia, including Egypt, Algeria, Slovakia and Armenia. The removals will leave dozens of US embassies without a Senate-confirmed ambassador at a time when China continues to expand its diplomatic footprint worldwide.The State Department has defended the move as routine. A senior official said an ambassador is the personal representative of the president and that Trump has the right to ensure envoys advance his “America First” agenda. The official confirmed the diplomats would not be fired but reassigned, though many face retirement if no new posting is found within a limited window.Secretary of State Marco Rubio has linked the reshuffle to broader changes in promotion criteria and departmental reorganisation, including a push to roll back Diversity, Equity and Inclusion policies. Rubio said hundreds of diplomats had been newly nominated for promotion under revised rules overseen by adjusted panels.Critics, however, argue the changes are designed to elevate officials seen as politically aligned with the White House. Powerful figures such as deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller have openly sought to reshape the State Department to support stricter immigration policies and a more ideological foreign policy.The recall has deepened an already severe morale crisis within the foreign service. AFSA recently released survey results showing 98% of respondents reported declining morale since Trump’s second term began in January. Many cited shrinking budgets, heavier workloads and reduced US foreign aid. Only 1% said conditions had improved.Earlier this year, the department announced around 1,300 layoffs, including more than 240 Foreign Service officers, as part of what Rubio described as a reorganisation. Several senior diplomats, many of them women or people of colour, also lost previously assigned overseas leadership roles.","The move is highly unusual and has not been publicly announced by the administration.

The updated framework slashes customer fees, caps charges across multiple services, and pushes for digital solutions, marking a clear push toward fairness, transparency, and financial inclusion.The newly issued fees guide will replace the current Banking Tariff and applies to all banks and payment companies supervised by SAMA. Once officially enforced, which is set within 60 days from its publication, the guide will standardize fees, ensuring that customers across the Kingdom face fair and reasonable charges.SAMA emphasized that the guide is designed to strengthen disclosure and transparency, support financial inclusion, and encourage wider adoption of digital channels. This update represents the first guide covering all financial institutions and the third edition specific to banks, reflecting ongoing modernization efforts across Saudi Arabia’s financial sector.One of the most notable changes affects administrative fees for non-real estate finance products, including consumer and motor finance leasing.This move significantly reduces costs for customers seeking personal and vehicle financing.The guide also sets clear limits on fees for Mada card services, aiming to make card usage more affordable and predictable. Key updates include:SAMA clarified that these fees do not include delivery costs, and customers can collect cards from bank branches without additional charges.Several other banking services have seen significant reductions:These changes make everyday banking tasks more affordable and straightforward for customers.The guide also standardizes fees for domestic electronic transfers through bank accounts and digital wallets:This standardization encourages the use of digital transfers and reduces the cost barrier for small and medium transactions.SAMA has also removed or lowered charges for various account-related documents:This aligns with SAMA’s push to make information more accessible and reduce unnecessary fees.Financial institutions have 60 days to align their systems and disclosures with the new guide. The full guide is available on SAMA’s Rulebook via its official website.Overall, the updated fee structure reflects SAMA’s ongoing efforts to protect consumers, improve sector efficiency, and accelerate the adoption of digital financial services. By introducing these changes, the Kingdom reinforces confidence in its financial system while making banking more transparent and affordable for everyone.","The Saudi Central Bank, known as SAMA, has unveiled a comprehensive new fees guide for financial institutions.

What is the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC)?





The FBI is seeking information on Saeed Tavakoli, an Iranian national wanted for his alleged association with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).The wanted man goes by the alias Sardar Ammar.According to federal authorities, Tavakoli is believed to be the chief of IRGC-Qods Force Department 11000. He is alleged to have directed covert intelligence and lethal operations against dissidents, journalists, Israeli citizens, and current and former US government officials in both Europe and the United States.Tavakoli is also accused of leading a network linked to attempted attacks in Australia, Greece, Germany, and Mexico.The FBI has released physical details for identification purposes. Tavakoli is a male with gray or white hair, brown eyes, and speaks Farsi.Authorities are urging anyone with information to contact their local FBI office or the nearest American embassy or consulate, and the investigation is being handled by the FBI’s Washington, DC field office.IRGC is a branch of Iran’s armed forces that answers directly to the country’s Supreme Leader, rather than to elected officials. It was created after the 1979 Iranian Revolution to protect the new theocratic regime and to act as a counterweight to the regular military. The IRGC now operates its own army, navy, air force and intelligence apparatus, and is highly involved in Iran’s politics, economy and regional security efforts. Its external arm, the Quds Force, supports allied groups and conducts overseas operations. The United States and several other countries have designated parts of the IRGC as a terrorist organisation due to its involvement in violence.","The FBI is seeking information on Saeed Tavakoli, an Iranian national wanted for his alleged association with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) The wanted man goes by the alias Sardar Ammar.

"After power outage, San Francisco wonders: Can robot taxis handle a big quake?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/after-power-outage-san-francisco-wonders-can-robot-taxis-handle-a-big-quake/articleshow/126151163.cms,".





San Francisco officials on Monday called for an investigation into Waymo after its autonomous taxis blocked intersections and snarled traffic during an hourslong power outage over the weekend.The meltdown, which led Waymo to temporarily shut down its entire flee, raised alarms about whether the vehicles might impede evacuations or emergency services during a bigger disaster, such as a major earthquake. ""We haven't seen a situation before where Waymos have stalled en masse across the city,"" said Bilal Mahmood, a San Francisco supervisor who said he would hold a hearing examining Waymo's operations during emergencies. San Francisco is the epicentre of driverless cars in the US, and Waymos in particular have become ubiquitous in the past year, with camera-laden white Jaguars seemingly on every block. Waymo, owned by Google parent company Alphabet, arrived in the tech capital in 2023 and has about 1,000 vehicles roaming its hills and avenues.After initial hesitation, San Franciscans have increasingly grown to rely on the cars. Some women feel safer in a driverless car than in one driven by a man, and parents have been known to use them for school pickups.But Waymo has had a rough go of it recently. One car killed a beloved bodega cat in Oct, causing an uproar. And this weekend's events sparked even more outrage and debate,. It was perhaps the first time Waymo taxis failed on such a wide scale. It was also one of the rare instances, perhaps, where human drivers had a clear advantage over the robots.""They don't have them programmed for when there's a power outage, never mind when there's an earthquake and there's rubble in the street and all the power is out,"" said Jeanine Nicholson, who served as the city fire chief for five years until she retired last year. ""They're still building the plane while they're flying it. Mahmood said stalled Waymo taxis had blocked fire trucks from quickly reaching a burning PG&E substation, which had been one of the causes of the extended outage. After the outage began, Mayor Daniel Lurie's office contacted Waymo about the gridlock its cars were contributing to, and the company agreed to suspend services. Service resumed by Sunday afternoon.It remains unknown exactly why the cars stalled. Some experts speculated the vehicles rely on cell service to communicate with remote operators in emergency situations, and the connections dropped in the outage. Others have said the company may have purposely shut down the cars as it was too risky to have them navigate through so many dead traffic lights.Elon Musk said Tesla Robotaxis, which provide limited services in the city, had been unaffected. (Tesla service is still required to have a human safety monitor on board. Waymo said that while its vehicles are designed to treat nonfunctional signals as four-way stops, ""the sheer scale of the outage led to instances where vehicles remained stationary longer than usual to confirm the state of the affected intersections. .."" It added, ""We are focused on rapidly integrating the lessons learned from the event.""","San Francisco officials call for an investigation into Waymo after its autonomous taxis blocked intersections and snarled traffic during an hourslong power outage.

From civil rights to clickbait: Dave Chappelle’s take on Charlie Kirk comparison with Martin Luther King Jr,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/from-civil-rights-to-clickbait-dave-chappelles-take-on-charlie-kirk-comparison-with-martin-luther-king-jr/articleshow/126150455.cms,"



Comedian Dave Chappelle has forcefully rejected a comparison between conservative commentator Charlie Kirk and civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr, calling the idea exaggerated and fundamentally misguided.In a clip circulating widely on social media, Chappelle responded to claims that Kirk represents a modern equivalent of Dr King. His verdict was blunt, arguing that the comparison stretches credibility far beyond breaking point.Chappelle dismissed the analogy almost immediately, saying that while both figures are well known, the similarities effectively end there. He acknowledged that both men have faced violence, but stressed that shared notoriety or controversy does not place them on the same moral or historical footing.According to Chappelle, equating a digital-era political influencer with a leader of a mass civil rights movement misunderstands what made Dr King significant. “That’s a reach,” he said, a phrase commonly used to describe an argument that is forced or unsupported by reality.At the heart of Chappelle’s critique was the difference between activism shaped by history and activism shaped by algorithms. He described Kirk primarily as an internet personality whose influence depends on provoking reactions and driving engagement online.Chappelle argued that modern online figures often rely on controversy to remain visible, because outrage fuels clicks, views and shares. That dynamic, he suggested, is fundamentally incompatible with the kind of leadership embodied by Dr King, whose work was rooted in grassroots organising, moral persuasion and sustained collective action.To underline the contrast, Chappelle jokingly imagined Dr King adopting the language of modern content creators, urging audiences to “subscribe” or “change my mind”, a comparison that drew laughter while reinforcing his point about the absurdity of the analogy.The episode highlights a broader cultural tension over how historical legacies are invoked in today’s political debates. As social media blurs the line between activism, commentary and entertainment, comparisons to figures such as Martin Luther King Jr increasingly provoke backlash.For Chappelle, the line remains clear. Moral leadership forged in the struggle for civil rights, he suggests, cannot be reduced to viral moments or engagement metrics. In his view, moving “from civil rights to clickbait” is precisely where such comparisons go wrong.",Comedian Dave Chappelle has forcefully rejected a comparison between conservative commentator Charlie Kirk and civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr. He described Kirk primarily as an internet personality whose influence depends on provoking reactions and driving engagement online.

Pennsylvania nursing home blast: Facility rated one star and ‘much below average’ in health inspections,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/pennsylvania-nursing-home-blast-facility-rated-one-star-and-much-below-average-in-health-inspections/articleshow/126150387.cms,"



The Silver Lake Nursing Home, the site of a devastating explosion on Tuesday, had an overall rating of one star on Medicare’s federal Care Compare system, indicating its health inspections are considered “much below average. ”The rating has raised questions about the facility’s safety and care standards, especially following the blast, which trapped many residents under debris. The explosion is suspected to have been caused by a gas leak, and numerous rescue teams were on site to assist.The Medicare star system evaluates nursing homes across three categories: health inspections, staffing, and quality measures. Silver Lake scores particularly poorly in health inspections, receiving only one star. Inspectors found multiple deficiencies in care and compliance with state and federal standards.The most recent health inspection in the nursing home took place in September 2024. The facility passed fire safety and emergency preparedness checks, the low inspection score suggests there were significant issues in resident care, medication management, or overall safety compliance. The poor ranking indicates that Silver Lake performs far below the national average for nursing homes of similar size and scope.Medicare’s five-star system is designed to help families and caregivers compare facilities when making decisions about care. A one-star rating, particularly in health inspections, signals potential risks to residents and areas in urgent need of improvement. The rating does not capture every aspect of care, but it shows significant concerns about regulatory compliance and day-to-day operations.The importance of rating comes into play after the nursing home suffered a major explosion, which trapped residents and forced emergency crews to conduct large-scale evacuations. The exact cause of the blast is still under investigation, but the facility’s low health inspection score has raised questions about its readiness for emergencies and its overall ability to protect residents.","Silver Lake Nursing Home had an overall rating of one star on Medicare’s federal Care Compare system.

"'Every day, I miss home': Sikh truck driver Arash Singh on struggles of being an immigrant driver in US",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/every-day-i-miss-home-sikh-truck-driver-arash-singh-on-struggles-of-being-an-immigrant-driver-in-us/articleshow/126148322.cms,"Two major accidents caused by Sikh truck drivers

In August, a semi‑truck on the Florida Turnpike attempted an illegal U‑turn and blocked oncoming traffic, causing a minivan to crash into the trailer and killing all three people inside. The driver was a 28-year-old Indian national named Harjinder Singh who had entered US without documentation and obtained a commercial licence in California. He survived the collision. He has been charged with vehicular homicide and manslaughter in connection with the crash, which was captured on vehicle recorder footage.

In October 2025, Jashanpreet Singh, a 21‑year‑old Indian‑origin truck driver from California, was involved in a chain‑reaction crash on Interstate 10 in Ontario, California. Officials said his truck ploughed into slow‑moving traffic, killing three people and injuring others. He was arrested and charged with gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated and driving under the influence of drugs.





Arash Singh, a 25-year-old Sikh truck driver, has spent thousands of miles on US highways hauling goods from Washington to California, navigating ice storms, heavy traffic, and occasional harassment because of his turban.“As an immigrant driver,” he told New York Times, “there is plenty you always must think about.”Singh sought asylum in US in 2022 and recently faced the threat of losing his commercial driver licence under new federal rules targeting foreign drivers. California began revoking licences after audits found thousands of commercial licences were improperly issued. Singh received a notice saying he needed proof of permanent residency or citizenship to keep his licence. He has neither, although a federal court has temporarily stayed the rules.The crackdown followed two fatal crashes involving Sikh truck drivers in California and drew criticism from immigrant advocacy groups. US transportation secretary Sean Duffy said the measures aimed to improve safety and compliance among foreign drivers. Democrats and Blue state leaders said the the rules unfairly target legally working immigrants.Sikhs have a long history in American trucking with many settling in California. Today, around 150,000 Sikhs work in the trucking industry in the US, with a quarter of Sikh adults employed in the sector, according to the North American Punjabi Trucking Association.Singh said the work is vital for his family. Most of his earnings go to truck payments and sending money to relatives in India. “Every day, I miss my home, but it’s better here,” he said. “I can work and support my family. It’s safer for me here.”He described the day-to-day challenges of life on the road, including long hours, solitary meals, and adjusting his routine to avoid drawing unecessary attention. However, Singh said he remains committed to driving. “I want to work,” he said.Officials in California, including City Council member Manpreet Kaur, said the policy is creating fear in the trucking community. “People are scared,” she said. “This is yet another immigrant community being targeted.”","Sikhs have a long history in American trucking with many settling in California.

Poll shock: Trump’s longtime critic Jerome Powell is more popular than the president,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/poll-shock-trumps-longtime-critic-jerome-powell-is-more-popular-than-the-president/articleshow/126148126.cms,"

What the poll reveals about Trump and Powell



Trump trails despite strong Republican support



A long-running clash



Rates, policy and public moments





Jerome Powell has emerged as the most popular figure among senior US leaders, according to a new national survey. The finding places him ahead of President Donald Trump , whose approval rating remains near historic lows.The results come from a Gallup national poll conducted in early December 2025. The survey was carried out between December 1 and 15 and included roughly 1,000 US adults. It measured job approval for 13 major political and institutional figures.Gallup found that Powell holds a 44% job-approval rating, the highest of any figure tested in the survey. Trump’s approval rating stood at 36%, which Gallup described as a new low for his second term and only slightly above his all-time low of 34% recorded in 2021.Only two figures crossed the 40% threshold. Powell ranked first, followed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who registered a 41% approval rating. All other leaders included in the poll remained below that level.The survey shows that Trump’s approval remains sharply polarised along partisan lines. About 89% of Republicans approve of his performance, while support among independents is far lower and approval among Democrats is near zero.This divide continues to pull the president’s overall rating into the mid-30s.Powell’s numbers also reflect partisan division. While his 44% approval does not represent majority support, it remains the strongest net rating among all the figures tested in the poll.The result is notable given Trump’s repeated and public attacks on Powell throughout 2025. The president has criticised the Fed chair over interest-rate policy, called him a “loser,” and pressed the central bank to cut rates more aggressively to support economic growth.Trump has also suggested that Powell should resign and has openly weighed replacing him when his term as Fed chair ends in May 2026, despite having nominated Powell to the position during his first term.The Federal Reserve has cut interest rates three times this year as it seeks to support a slowing economy. The most recent cut, announced in December, lowered the benchmark rate by 0.25 percentage points to a target range of 3.5% to 3.75%.Tensions between the two men have also played out publicly. In July, Powell corrected Trump during a visit to the Federal Reserve after the president misstated renovation costs at the Fed’s headquarters, an exchange that drew widespread attention.Gallup noted that no leader in the survey approached 50% approval, highlighting a broader mood of dissatisfaction with national leadership. The poll measures job approval rather than personal favourability or voting intent and reflects deep partisan divides across nearly all figures tested.","Gallup found that Powell holds a 44% job-approval rating, the highest of any figure tested in the survey.

'Nepotism never fails': Indian-origin FedEx CEO Raj Subramaniam draws flak over H-1B hiring,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/send-them-all-home-indian-origin-fedex-ceo-raj-subramaniam-faces-flak-over-h-1b-hiring/articleshow/126148077.cms,"FedEx's reformed hiring pattern



FedEx CEO faces flak for H-1B hiring



The situation revealed







Among one the most raging issues being discussed in the US and across the globe right now, is the future of the H-1B visa and the workers who have arrived in the land of dreams on it. Ever since Trump took over with his second term, illegal migration and H-1B have been top targets of his administrative policies and along with the American economy and companies, workers have also been suffering.People who are the sole earning members of their family or live in the country on the basis of their work are facing sudden challenges with employers backing out on their support and job insecurity looming over their heads. Now, according to The Dallas Express, official documents show that FedEx significantly raised the number of foreign workers it hired under the H-1B visa and decreased the number of American positions in different parts of the US.This has led to Indian-origin FedEx CEO Rajesh Subramaniam receiving harsh social media flak for the company's decisions. Here's all you need to know.In late 2022, FedEx, a prominent international shipping label received a massive $2 billion contract. Soon, the company began hiring outside the US more than inside it. As per the company itself, the hires are based on business needs and skills. A company spokesperson told The Dallas Express that FedEx is focused on helping employees grow and building a workforce as per its operations.“Across our business, we employ a wide range of roles, requiring a variety of skillsets and are committed to complying with all applicable federal immigration laws,” they said.Now, FedEx CEO Raj Subramaniam is facing heavy criticism on social media for firing American employees and dismissing their jobs to bring in foreign workers. The move is especially surprising at a time when most companies are cutting off H-1B workers to avoid the hefty $100,000 fee under the new Trump administration rules.""FedEx CEO. Indian nepotism never fails. They will always replace you,"" wrote a person on X.""But we were told it's racist to hire our own people. But everyone else can do it. This is what tyranny looks like at the government level,"" pointed out another.""That’s what happens when Indians are made CEOs of American companies,"" another social media user wrote.""Cancel every damn visa… send them all home…"" one called out while numerous others called out for the contract to be dismissed.""Indian CEO takes over, fires Americans, hires H1Bs, then ships jobs to India. Like clockwork,"" claimed another.According to The Dallas Express, the US Transportation Command chose FedEx and two other companies in December 2022 to manage package deliveries for government organisations. The value for the arrangement was estimated at $2.24 billion and is a part of the Next Generation Delivery Service-2 initiative, as per GovCon Wire.The contract's first phase began on April 1st, 2023 and will end on September 30th, 2026. As per statistics from the US Citizenship and Immigration Services H-1B database, when the contract was made public in 2022, FedEx recruited about 20 approved H-1B employees. The number surged to 500 over the next three years with an increase in hiring in 2024 and 2025.As per additional data, some of the companies' visa applications were for commercial and technical jobs in Texas whose salaries ranged between $100,000 and $115,000. Additionally, the applicants showed start dates in places that coincided with layoffs in the same areas. It is crucial to note that not every visa application leads to a successful hiring, making it difficult to determine the precise number of people who were hired.","In late 2022, FedEx, a prominent international shipping label received a massive $2 billion contract.

A visiting American family has gone viral after posting a video criticising what they described as the “worst immigration experience” while trying to extend their visa in Sri Lanka.The Hutchinson family shared the clip on TikTok after visiting the Department of Immigration and Emigration in Colombo to extend their 30-day tourist visa. The video was filmed in a vlog-style format where the father speaks directly to the camera, describing a long and stressful day at the office.According to the family, they first attempted to extend their visa online but were unable to do so because the official website kept malfunctioning. Left with no choice, they travelled to the Colombo immigration office in person.The man says they arrived early, queued outside and collected a ticket, but then waited for around three hours in “absolute chaos”. He complained of a lack of clear instructions, people pushing ahead in line, staff shouting and officials being unhelpful.He also claimed one staff member stayed on his phone while ignoring people waiting to be served.The family said conditions inside were uncomfortable, with no air conditioning, overcrowding and children crying, including their own.Despite eventually paying the required fees and receiving the visa extension, the man said the process was the most frustrating experience they had faced in any country.“We've been loving Sri Lanka – it's been absolutely amazing,” he said, adding that the country’s natural beauty and friendly people were being undermined by poor administration. “Sri Lanka, you gotta sort this out if you want more tourists staying longer.”His wife briefly appears in the video, describing the experience as “awful” and “so stressful”.The video ends with the family outside the building, relieved the process was completed but warning other travellers to be prepared for delays.

Freedom of association, as well as the principle of individual rather than collective criminal responsibility, are fundamental human rights.

Larry Nassar, the former US gymnastics team doctor serving decades in prison for sexual abuse, resurfaced in public attention after a disturbing letter linked to pedophile Jeffrey Epstein appeared in newly released government documents.The letter appears to have been written by Epstein and addressed to Nassar. It is included in the latest batch of Epstein-related files released by the US Department of Justice (DOJ). It was reportedly postmarked on August 13, 2019, three days after Epstein was found dead in his cell in New York.Nassar is a former sports doctor who worked with the US Olympic gymnastics team and Michigan State University. He is currently serving a 60-year federal prison sentence for possession of child sexual abuse images. In addition, he received a state sentence of 40 to 175 years in Michigan in 2018 after pleading guilty to seven counts of criminal sexual conduct.More than 150 women testified during sentencing hearings that Nassar sexually abused them under the guise of medical treatment. Those victims included Olympic gold medallists Aly Raisman and McKayla Maroney.The letter attributed to Epstein was first reported in 2023 by the Associated Press after being found among more than 4,000 pages of Bureau of Prisons records.It was discovered weeks after Epstein’s death in a jail mail room, returned from a prison in Arizona and marked “no longer at this address”.In an email included in the documents, an investigator wrote: “It appeared he mailed it out and it was returned back to him. I am not sure if I should open it or should we hand it over to anyone?”The letter itself contains shocking language. “As you will know by now, I have taken the ‘short route’ home,” it reads. “Good luck! We shared one thing … our love & caring for young ladies and the hope they reach their full potential.”It goes on to say: “Our president also shares our love of young, nubile girls. When a young beauty walked by he loved to ‘grab snatch’, whereas we ended up snatching grub in the mess halls of the system.”The letter is signed: “Life is unfair. Yours, J. Epstein.” Donald Trump , who was president at the time, has repeatedly denied any involvement in Epstein’s crimes or any wrongdoing. The Department of Justice said the document release were fake. In a post on X, DOJ said: ""The FBI has confirmed this alleged letter from Jeffrey Epstein to Larry Nassar is FAKE. The fake letter was received by the jail, and flagged for the FBI at the time.""It remains unclear whether Epstein and Nassar ever had a direct relationship. The document’s release comes as speculation continues around Epstein’s death, which was ruled a suicide, a conclusion disputed by his brother, Mark Epstein.","The letter appears to have been written by Epstein and addressed to Nassar. It was reportedly postmarked on August 13, 2019, three days after Epstein was found dead in his cell in New York. The Department of Justice said the document release were fake.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126147403,imgsize-981627,width-400,resizemode-4/126147403.jpg"

"DHS replaces H-1B random lottery selection, priority will now be given to those earning higher wages",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/dhs-replaces-h-1b-random-lottery-selection-priority-will-now-be-given-to-those-earning-higher-wages/articleshow/126145070.cms,".





The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has moved to overhaul the H-1B work visa selection process, replacing the long-standing random lottery with a system that gives preference to higher-paid and more highly skilled foreign workers, a shift the Trump administration states is aimed at protecting American wages and jobs.This rule, together with the imposition of the $ 100,000 entry-fee for new H-1B applications and the proposed hike in wages will make it more challenging for companies to recruit overseas employees under the H-1B visa program – this is not good news for those pursuing the American dream. On the flip side, this is expected to result in more offshoring – with countries like India, expected to benefit through expansion of global capability centres.This new rule, released on Tuesday night, will take effect from Feb 27, 2026 - it will be in place before the E-registrations for the coming H-1B cap applications open. There is an annual quota of 85,000 (including the Masters cap) for H-1B cap applications. E-registrations for H-1B applications open in March. As demand significantly exceeds supply, post registration a random lottery is conducted. The sponsoring employers then file a detailed H-1B application for those candidates (beneficiaries) who were successfully selected in the lottery.The random selection (lottery) mechanism will now stand changed. Under the new rule, H-1B visas will no longer be allocated purely by chance. Instead, registrations will be weighted according to wage levels set by the US Department of Labour (DOL), increasing the likelihood of selection for applicants offered higher salaries.In an official statement the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) contends that the existing lottery had been misused by some employers to bring in lower-paid foreign labour at the expense of US workers.“The existing random selection process of H-1B registrations was exploited and abused by US employers who were primarily seeking to import foreign workers at lower wages than they would pay American workers,” Matthew Tragesser, a spokesperson for USCIS, said in a statement. He added that the weighted system would better reflect congressional intent behind the programme and strengthen US competitiveness by encouraging employers to seek higher-skilled and higher-paid talent.The rule does not make substantial changes from draft rules that were released in Sept. TOI had done a deep dive into the mechanism set down in the draft rules and its implications. An H-1B candidate with a Level IV wage offer (the highest tier) would be entered into the lottery four times, while a Level III beneficiary would be entered three times, a Level II beneficiary twice, and a Level I beneficiary only once. This ‘weighted lottery’ approach would give higher odds of selection to those offered the highest wages.Under the current system, all beneficiaries (across all four levels) entered in the lottery face equal odds of selection of about 29.59%. Under the proposed rule, however, odds diverge sharply by wage level.The National Foundation for American Policy (NFAP), which had analysed the draft rules had stated that under the new mechanism, the probability of selecting an individual at Level IV for an H-1B application would increase by 107% but fall by 48% for individuals at Level I. Effectively, the rule would tilt opportunities heavily toward mid-career professionals or those in senior roles, while creating a barrier for entry-level professionals, including the bulk of recent international graduates from US universities.The implications for the Indian diaspora who aspire to work in the US at lower tiers – such as new graduates from US universities are stark. For the fiscal ended Sept 2024, of the 1.41 lakh H-1B applications approved by US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), 80,449 (or 57%) were for Indian beneficiaries. It should be noted that the total figure is above the annual quota of 85,000 as USCIS keeps a buffer for rejections or employers withdrawing from the process.USCIS added that this rule is another crucial step to strengthen the integrity of the H-1B visa program. “As part of the Trump Administration’s commitment to H-1B reform, we will continue to demand more from both employers and aliens so as not to undercut American workers and to put America first,” said Tragesser.","The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has moved to overhaul the H-1B work visa selection process. The new rule, released on Tuesday night, will take effect from Feb 27, 2026 - it will be in place before the E-registrations for the coming H- 1B cap applications open.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126145065,imgsize-24358,width-400,resizemode-4/1280720-2025-12-23t223312720.jpg"

Emails link Maxwell to ‘Balmoral Summer Camp’





The Justice Department’s largest disclosure yet includes FBI interviews, victim accounts, emails involving Ghislaine Maxwell , and flight record allegations linked to Donald Trump The US Department of Justice on Tuesday released nearly 30,000 pages of documents, photographs, and investigative material related to Jeffrey Epstein , marking the biggest tranche of files disclosed so far.Alongside the release, the DOJ warned that the records include “untrue and sensationalist claims” involving President Donald Trump, though it did not specify which allegations it was referring to.Trump addressed the partial release of the Epstein files for the first time at a press conference on Monday. He warned that the disclosure process could “ruin” reputations and said it was overshadowing his policy agenda.With the latest batch representing the most extensive release to date, the newly disclosed records show several key findings.Among the newly released documents is a grand jury interview with an unnamed FBI agent from May 2007. The agent described an allegation that Epstein recruited a 15-year-old girl to give him a topless massage.The agent said a witness had recruited other girls from among their peer group, adding: “Epstein liked girls like her, which is thin and blonde and attractive,” as quoted by the Independent.Another witness quoted in the files described Epstein as selective and highly focused on the age of the girls he allowed to work for him, adding that Epstein rejected some girls he “didn’t really like” and once dismissed a potential masseur as “too old” at 23.A handwritten note from a May 2019 interview states the financier was “asking for ID to girl, wanted make sure under 18 b/c he wasn’t believing them b/c [redacted] messed up by bringing more older girls.”A letter allegedly written by Jeffrey Epstein to Larry Nassar, the former USA Gymnastics team doctor who was convicted of sexual abuse, was also found.In the letter, postmarked August 13, 2019, three days after Epstein’s death in a Manhattan jail cell, Epstein allegedly wrote: “As you know by now, I have taken the ‘short route’ home.”“We shared one thing, our love and caring for young ladies and the hope they’d reach their full potential,"" he added.Epstein reportedly mentioned President Donald Trump, writing, “Our president also shares our love of young, nubile girls. When a young beauty walked by he loved to ‘grab snatch,’ whereas we ended up snatching grub in the mess halls of the system.”“Life is unfair,” and signed: “Yours, J. EpsteinA December 2020 email included in the files contains a statement from one of Jeffrey Epstein’s victims prepared for a court bail hearing involving Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s former girlfriend and associate.In the statement, the victim described Maxwell’s background and behavior, saying she had “lived a life of privilege” and abused her position of power. The statement added that fleeing the country “would fit with her long history of anti-social behavior.”“I believe that she is a psychopath… She has demonstrated a complete failure to accept responsibility in any way for her actions and demonstrated a complete lack of remorse for her central role in procuring victims for Epstein.”The victim also described Maxwell’s role in the grooming process, stating that she was “both charming and manipulative with me during the grooming process.”A February 1, 2008 email written by an assistant US attorney in Florida following interviews with Epstein’s victims.“We just finished interviewing three of the girls. I wish you could have been there to see how much this has affected them,” the email reads. “One girl broke down sobbing so that we had to stop the interview twice within a 20 minute span… she said that she was having nightmares about Epstein coming after her.”A document released is a January 7, 2020 email discussing Epstein flight records.The email states that “Donald Trump traveled on Epstein's private jet many more times than previously has been reported (or that we were aware).”The sender and recipient are redacted, but the email is attributed to an assistant US attorney in the Southern District of New York.According to the email, Trump was “listed as a passenger on at least eight flights between 1993 and 1996,” including four flights on which Maxwell was also present. The email also states Trump traveled with Marla Maples , his daughter Tiffany, and his son Eric.It further claims that one 1993 flight listed only Epstein and Trump as passengers, while another listed Epstein, Trump, and a then-20-year-old individual whose name is redacted.The newly released documents reportedly include a 12-second video sent to the FBI that claimed to show Jeffrey Epstein’s suicide in his New York jail cell in August 2019. The video appears to have been submitted by a member of the public who had seen it circulating online and contacted the FBI to ask whether it was authentic.Newly released documents also show email correspondence involving Ghislaine Maxwell from August 2001.In one message, a person identified as “A” or “The Invisible Man” wrote: “I am up here at Balmoral Summer Camp for the Royal Family.” The email references “new inappropriate friends.”Maxwell replied: “So sorry to dissappoint [sic] you, however the truth must be told. I have only been able to find appropriate friends.”“A” later responded: “Distraught!”Jeffrey Epstein entered a plea deal with prosecutors in 2008 after the parents of a 14-year-old girl reported to Florida police that he had molested their daughter.Investigators found photographs of girls throughout his residence, and Epstein was convicted of soliciting prostitution from a minor. The plea agreement allowed him to avoid a lengthy prison sentence.More than a decade later, he was charged again, accused of operating a network that exploited underage girls for sex. Epstein died in prison in 2019 while awaiting trial, and his death was ruled a suicide.","The Justice Department on Tuesday released nearly 30,000 pages of documents, photographs, and investigative material related to Jeffrey Epstein. The DOJ warned that the records include “untrue and sensationalist claims” involving President Donald Trump.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan’s chief of defence forces field marshal Asim Munir has claimed that Islamabad received “divine help” during the military confrontation with India in May, while also asking Afghanistan’s Taliban regime to choose between Pakistan and the Tehrik i Taliban Pakistan, PTI reported.Addressing the National Ulema Conference in Islamabad, Munir in a widely circulated video said Pakistan’s armed forces experienced “divine intervention” during the four day conflict triggered after India launched Operation Sindoor. “We felt it,” he said.India carried out Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan occupied Kashmir in retaliation for the Pahalgam attack that killed 26 civilians. The strikes led to intense clashes between the two countries for four days and ended with an understanding to halt military actions on May 10.Meanwhile, Munir warned the Afghan Taliban to choose between Pakistan and the TTP, saying Afghan nationals form the majority of militants infiltrating across the border. “In the TTP formations coming [into Pakistan], 70 per cent are Afghans,” he said. “Is Afghanistan not spilling the blood of our Pakistani children?” He reiterated that Kabul must decide between Pakistan and the TTP.The Field Marshal also said that no one could declare jihad in an Islamic state except the state itself. “No one can issue a fatwa for jihad without the order and permission and will of those vested with the authority,” he said.Munir also drew parallels between Pakistan and the state established by the Prophet 1,400 years ago in the Arab region, now Saudi Arabia.He said that among the world’s 57 Islamic countries, “God gave us the honour of being the protectors of Haramain Sharifain,” referring to Makkah and Madina.Official details of the December 10 address were limited, with selected clips aired later by Pakistani media.","Pakistan’s chief of defence forces field marshal Asim Munir has claimed that Islamabad received ‘divine help’ during the military confrontation with India in May.

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan , currently incarcerated for now over two years, on Saturday called on his supporters to prepare for nationwide protests and announced his intention to challenge the recent Toshakhana-II verdict, which he alleged was delivered in “haste” by the Islamabad high court. Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, were sentenced to 17 years in prison in the corruption case earlier this week.He also alleged that Pakistan is being governed by solely under ""Asim law.""With no access to his social media accounts, Khan conveyed his message through his legal team. According to a post on X summarising a conversation between the PTI founder and his lawyer, Khan instructed Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Sohail Afridi to begin preparations for a mass street movement.In the detailed message shared by his team, Khan said: “To strive for justice is a sacred duty, and I am ready to lay down my life for Haqeeqi Azadi (true freedom) of my nation. At this moment, Pakistan is being governed solely under ‘Asim Law’. Here, verdicts are pre-written and merely announced aloud. Like the baseless decisions and sentences of the past three years, the Toshakhana 2 verdict is nothing new for me. This ruling, too, was delivered in haste, without any evidence and without fulfilling legal requirements.Neither we nor our lawyers were even given opportunity to present our case.”He alleged that both he and Bushra Bibi were being subjected to harsh solitary confinement. “The sustained solitary confinement imposed on me and my wife constitutes severe mental torture. We are barred from books, television, and meetings… The books sent by my family are confiscated by jail authorities, and we are kept in solitary confinement for weeks at a time. This treatment is inhumane, yet all this oppression and brutality cannot weaken my resolve. ”Khan also accused the authorities of persecuting women linked to PTI. “It is not our tradition to target women and children… I am deeply saddened and distressed by the mistreatment and brutality faced by my sisters and other women outside Adiala Jail. The treatment meted out to Bushra Bibi, Dr. Yasmin, Mahrang Baloch, and other women stands in clear violation of Islamic traditions and moral values.”The former prime minister again directed his criticism at army chief Asim Munir . “The army is mine and belongs to the people of Pakistan. When I criticise Asim Munir, it is criticism of an individual… Whatever is happening to me in jail is being carried out on the instructions of a colonel acting under Asim Munir’s orders.”Urging the legal fraternity to mobilise, Khan said: “For the struggle to restore the rule of law and uphold the Constitution, it is essential for the Insaf Lawyers Forum and legal fraternity to step forward decisively.”He added that he had instructed his legal team to appeal the verdict: “I have full confidence in Salman Safdar and his team and have instructed them to file an appeal against these bogus decisions in the Islamabad high court.” Concluding his message, he said: “My message for Sohail Afridi is to prepare for a street movement. The entire nation must rise for their rights!! To strive for justice is a sacred duty, and I am ready to lay down my life for Haqeeqi Azadi (true freedom) of my nation. ”The message was signed off as: “Illegally Incarcerated Former Prime Minister of Pakistan, Imran Khan, speaking to his lawyers after the verdict of a military-style trial in Adiala Jail.”In an official statement, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) described the verdict as “blatantly unconstitutional, illegal, malicious and the worst form of political revenge and a textbook case of victimisation.”The party-led by Imran Khan alleged that the conviction aimed to prolong Khan’s imprisonment and ease pressure on what it called a “petrified ruling clique,” claiming political vendetta was being executed through a “subservient” judiciary.Addressing a press conference alongside senior party leader Asad Qaiser, PTI secretary general Salman Akram Raja said Khan had met his lead counsel, Barrister Salman Safdar, in the courtroom and shared a message for the nation. He quoted Khan as saying, “I am standing firm and resolute and will not seek an apology from anyone, come what may.”Raja added that the case lacked substantive evidence. “They have no witnesses except the person whom the PTI founder himself brought forward,” he said.Heavy police deployment was enforced across Rawalpindi, with more than 1,300 police officers and security personnel stationed at key locations to maintain law and order, after former Imran Khan called for the nationwide protests.","Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, were sentenced to 17 years in prison in the corruption case earlier this week.

Water crisis deepens public health risks





At least two women were killed and several others injured in Balochistan’s Noshki district after a passenger waggon skidded on a rain-soaked highway and collided with an oncoming truck, Dawn reported. The vehicle was travelling from Quetta to Chagai when the crash occurred near the Sher Jan Agha area.Five passengers sustained injuries, with two shifted to Quetta for critical care. Hospital officials said at least eight people hurt in rain-related incidents were brought to the Civil Hospital.The rainfall, which began on Saturday, ended a prolonged dry spell in the Quetta valley, offering brief relief to drought-hit farmers. However, it also caused widespread disruption. Despite forecasts ruling out significant rainfall, showers intensified by noon, flooding roads, halting traffic and plunging large parts of Quetta into darkness after electricity supplies were suspended. Mobile networks were also disrupted, leaving residents without communication for hours.Low-lying neighbourhoods, particularly areas with mud houses and weak construction, were badly affected as rainwater entered homes.Heavy rainfall was reported across several districts, including Ziarat, Pishin, Kalat, Zhob, Mastung and Sibi, with power outages lasting for hours in many areas.Meanwhile, experts warned that Pakistan’s water-quality crisis is worsening. Speaking at a seminar organised by the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE) in Islamabad, specialists said only 47 per cent of the population has access to safe drinking water, according to The Express Tribune.Dr Hifza Rasheed of the Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources said per capita freshwater availability has dropped from 5,260 cubic metres in 1951 to below 1,000 cubic metres in 2024, placing Pakistan among water-scarce nations. Unsafe water, experts said, accounts for nearly 40 per cent of illnesses nationwide and contributes to tens of thousands of child deaths each year.","A passenger waggon skidded on a rain-soaked highway and collided with an oncoming truck in Balochistan.

‘Might Never See Him Again’: Imran Khan’s Sons Claim 'Psychological Torture' In Pak's Adiala Jail





NEW DELHI: The Pakistan government on Saturday clarified that there is ""no embargo"" on former prime minister Imran Khan 's sons meeting their incarcerated father if they travel to the country. The government official also said the brothers would be granted Pakistani visas should they wish to come and visit him.The statement came after reports suggested that authorities had imposed unannounced restrictions on visits to Imran Khan, claiming that some visitors were using the meetings to advance political agendas. Following these reports, members of his family and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) expressed concern about the conditions in which he is being held.""There has been no embargo on Suleman Khan and Kasim Khan to meet their father, Imran Khan, at Adiala Jail, Rawalpindi,"" Interior state minister Talal Chaudhry told reporters.Suleman and Kasim, who currently live in London, are Khan’s sons from his first marriage to British TV personality Jemima Goldsmith.Chaudhry’s clarification comes days after the brothers told Sky News they fear they may never see their jailed father again.The brothers said they have not seen or spoken to the PTI founder, imprisoned since August 2023, for months, and voiced concerns about his safety and well-being.“If Suleman and Kasim apply for a Pakistani visa, we will give them. We will not stop them from meeting their father; therefore, the propaganda that the Pakistani government is creating hurdles in the meeting between father and sons should be stopped,” Chaudhry said.He also rejected reports that Khan is being kept in solitary confinement for 23 hours a day.In their interview, the brothers alleged that their father is being held in isolation, calling the conditions “clear torture tactics.”Khan, who has been in jail since August 2023, faces multiple cases filed against him since his ouster from power in April 2022.A United Nations special rapporteur has also warned that Khan is being held in conditions that may amount to inhuman or degrading treatment.In the interview, Kasim claimed Khan is confined to a cell measuring “six feet by eight inches,” barely large enough to stand.“They are not even allowing guards to speak to him because they want total isolation from any other person, just to try and break him. So it’s all very clear torture tactics,” he said.","Suleman and Kasim Khan are Imran Khan's sons from his first marriage.

NEW DELHI: A special court of Pakistan’s Federal Investigation Agency on Saturday sentenced former prime minister and Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf founder Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi to 17 years of imprisonment each in the Toshakhana 2 corruption case, Dawn reported.The court also imposed a fine of Pakistani Rs 16.4 million (INR 52,39,524) on each of them. Failure to pay the fine will result in additional jail time, according to the law.Citing the court order copy, Dawn reported that the sentences took into account Imran Khan’s age and the fact that Bushra Bibi is a woman, resulting in what the court described as a “lenient” punishment. “This court, while passing sentences has considered the old age of Imran Ahmed Khan Niazi, as well as the fact that Bushra Imran Khan is a female. It is in consideration of both said factors that a lenient view has been taken in awarding lesser punishment,” the order said.The verdict was delivered by special judge central Shahrukh Arjumand during a hearing held at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail, where Imran Khan is currently imprisoned.According to Dawn, the case relates to the alleged purchase of an expensive Bulgari jewellery set that was gifted to Imran Khan by the Saudi crown prince during an official visit in May 2021 and later acquired at a throwaway price.Imran Khan was sentenced to a total of 17 years in prison, including 10 years’ rigorous imprisonment under sections 34 and 409 of the Pakistan Penal Code and seven years under Section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act. Bushra Bibi was awarded the same sentence under identical provisions.The court also granted the benefit of Section 382 B of the Criminal Procedure Code, which allows the period of detention already undergone to be considered while awarding the sentence.Following the verdict, lawyers representing Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi said they would challenge the decision before the high court.The two were indicted in the case in December last year. Dawn noted that earlier this year in October, both had denied the allegations, calling the case fabricated and politically motivated.As per Dawn, while recording his statement under Section 342 of the Criminal Procedure Code, Imran Khan rejected the prosecution’s narrative and said the case was “malicious, fabricated, and politically engineered”. He argued that he did not qualify as a public servant under the Pakistan Penal Code and claimed he was unaware of the specific details of the gift, which he said was presented to his wife.Dawn further reported that the PTI founder maintained that due process was followed under the Toshakhana Policy 2018 and that the gift was declared, assessed and legally retained after payment to the national exchequer. “We complied with the Toshakhana Policy in letter and spirit,” he said.","Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi sentenced to 17 years of imprisonment each in corruption case.

Pakistan police on Wednesday registered a case under the Anti-Terrorism Act against the sisters of former prime minister Imran Khan and dozens of his supporters after a protest sit-in outside Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi.The protest on Tuesday was held after authorities refused to allow family members and lawyers to meet Khan, who is currently incarcerated. His sisters, along with leaders and workers of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), staged the sit-in outside the jail to protest the restriction.Police said a first information report (FIR) was lodged at Police Station Saddar Beroni, Rawalpindi, naming Khan’s sisters Aleema Khan and Noreen Niazi, as well as several PTI leaders and supporters. Those named include Salman Akram Raja, Naeem Panjotha, Qasim Khan, Aliya Hamza and Raja Nasir Abbas.Authorities also invoked Section 120 of the Pakistan Penal Code for alleged criminal conspiracy against the state, along with charges of attacking police personnel and violating Section 144.Police said, as reported by PTI, at least 14 suspects were arrested at the scene late Tuesday night, and efforts are continuing to arrest others named in the FIR.Imran Khan has been in jail since August 2023 and faces multiple cases filed after his removal from office in April 2022.Officials have placed restrictions on meetings with Khan, saying such visits are being used for political purposes. The last meeting with him took place on December 2, when his sister Uzma Khan was allowed to see him.","Police register a case against the sisters of former prime minister Imran Khan and dozens of his supporters after a protest sit-in outside Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi.

Survival without transformation





How is Pakistan’s economy still surviving? The question continues to arise as the country grapples with prolonged economic stress despite years of weak growth and low human development indicators.In recent years, Pakistan has dealt with sharp currency swings, runaways inflation between 2022 and 2024, persistent balance-of-payments pressures and mounting external debt burden. Yet the economy has managed to dodge a complete collapse, largely due to repeated bailouts from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and emergency financing from external partners.China has been key to this survival. Chinese loans and infrastructure investments have provided short-term relief but have also deepened Islamabad's financial dependence on Beijing. At the same time, Pakistan has sought to rebuild ties with the United States, long regarded as a key economic and diplomatic backstop.In this outreach, both army chief Asim Munir, now seen as the Pakistan's de facto power centre, and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif have taken apparent steps to engage Washington. The two leaders went ahead to nominate US President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, citing his role in easing military tensions with India.However, New Delhi had turned down the claims of any foreign influence in peaceful agreement with Islamabad in May this year.And Uncle Sam responded with goodwill. Compared to several other countries, it was exempted from steep trade tariffs, with Washington announcing a lower levy of 19%. Trump has also spoken of possible cooperation in developing what he described as ""massive oil reserves"" in Pakistan.The power structure in Pakistan has also been a point of concern in its economic turmoil. The military's expanding role in governance has often overshadowed the civilian leadership, while former prime minister and a popular leader Imran Khan remains in prison, keeping political tensions high and weighing on investor confidence.Neighbouring countries have also added to Pakistan’s economic strain. India’s suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty has emerged as a major setback, while Afghanistan’s Taliban government has announced plans to build dams upstream, moves that could further affect water availability and pose another risk to Pakistan’s economy and GDP growth.For now, Pakistan’s economy continues to function through foreign assistance, administrative controls and short-term stabilisation measures. Without sustained political stability, meaningful reforms and an effective check on corruption, its economic survival remains fragile.One of the most important stabilisers of Pakistan's economy has been the continued support from the International Monetary Fund and other multilateral lenders.The Governance and Corruption Diagnostic Assessment (GCDA) finalised in November 2025, was released ahead of the Fund's executive board's expected approval of a $1.2 billion disbursement, part of the ongoing 37-month, $7 billion programme started under the prime ministership of Shehbaz Sharif.With the latest approval, Pakistan has received around $3.3 billion from the IMF since last year. Under the bailout programme, Islamabad will continue to receive loan instalments over a 37-month period, contingent on meeting the agreed reform conditions.Pakistan narrowly avoided default in 2023 only after the IMF extended an earlier nine-month emergency deal, which was followed by the current longer programme. Since 1958, Pakistan has turned to the IMF 25 times, making it one of the IMF's most frequent borrowers.In 2025, IMF disbursements helped rebuild foreign exchange buffers, reassure markets and finance imports and debt servicing, according to Reuters.Pakistan's central bank has used monetary policy as a tactical tool to stabilise inflation while cautiously supporting growth.On December 15, the State Bank of Pakistan cut its key interest rate by 50 basis points to 10.5%, breaking a four-meeting hold. The SBP said the move was aimed at supporting sustainable economic growth while keeping inflation within target.According to Reuters, all 12 analysts in a Reuters poll had expected the central bank to hold the policy rate at 11%, particularly after the IMF warned against premature easing under Pakistan's $7 billion loan programme.The rate cut highlighted Pakistan's effort to revive domestic economic activity without destabilising the IMF-backed stabilisation framework.Despite underlying weaknesses, Pakistan has seen improving sentiment in financial markets.Credit ratings agencies S&P Global, Fitch and Moody’s upgraded Pakistan’s credit ratings in 2025, citing stronger finances and revenue gains. Investor appetite for Pakistan’s dollar bonds and equities has strengthened, with bonds delivering nearly 22% returns this year and the benchmark stock index gaining 44%, among the best performers in Asia.Bloomberg Economics estimates growth quickened to 3.4% year-on-year in the second quarter, with official data expected shortly.However, with the backdrop of political chaos, most notably the continued imprisonment of the country's most popular political figure, Imran Khan, investors have little confidence to make long-term plans in Pakistan.Pakistan has also moved to rebuild economic ties with the United States.According to Bloomberg, Islamabad is planning an investor conference in Washington to draw American investment in energy, mining and technology. Finance minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said the sectors where Pakistan seeks US investment are clearly identified.Economic links have improved following a new US-Pakistan trade deal setting a 19% tariff, lower than regional peers and well below the 50% tariff imposed on India.Meanwhile, Trump also promised to help Pakistan develop what he described as ""massive oil reserves"" on Pakistani soil. The remarks followed sustained praise and outreach from Pakistan’s de facto power centre, army chief Asim Munir, and were later echoed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who went on to nominate Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize on several occasions.“The first thing was to get the trade equation out of the way, which it is now,” Aurangzeb told Bloomberg.""Every single industry in Pakistan has to have an export component, because it’s the only way we're going to get out of this boom-and-bust cycle,"" Aurangzeb added.Beyond Western partners, Pakistan continues to rely heavily on China.According to the Middle East Institute, Pakistan’s strategic reliance on Beijing has deepened, particularly through the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). In January, Dawn reported that Pakistan and China reaffirmed their commitment to high-quality development of CPEC 2.0, focusing on industrialisation, special economic zones, clean energy, agriculture and livelihood projects.Chinese support has provided Pakistan with infrastructure investment, energy projects and diplomatic backing at moments of economic stress.While IMF financing has stabilised Pakistan, the IMF's own assessment paints a deeply troubling picture of governance in the Islamic Republic.The IMF's Governance and Corruption Diagnostic Assessment concluded that corruption in Pakistan is driven by ""state capture"", where public policy is manipulated to benefit a narrow circle of political and business elites.The 186-page report described dysfunctional institutions unable to enforce the rule of law or protect public resources. Corruption, the IMF said, is persistent and corrosive, distorting markets, eroding public trust and undermining fiscal stability.The report warns that without dismantling entrenched structures of elite privilege, Pakistan’s economic stagnation will persist.According to the IMF, the most economically damaging corruption involves privileged entities that exert influence over key economic sectors, including those owned by or affiliated with the state.Stefan Dercon, a professor of economic policy at the University of Oxford who has advised Pakistan on reforms, told Al Jazeera that lack of accountability continues to erode economic potential.""Failure of implementation [of laws and principles of accountability] gives vested interests too often free rein and addressing this must be at the core of efforts for economic reform,"" Dercon said.Ali Hasanain, associate professor of economics at the Lahore University of Management Sciences, said the IMF’s findings mirror long-standing domestic research.""The IMF diagnostic repeats what many domestic studies, including those by the World Bank and Pakistan’s own institutions, have already emphasised: Powerful interests shape rules to maintain their advantage,"" Hasanain told Al Jazeera.A 2021 UNDP report found that economic privileges granted to Pakistan’s elite, including politicians and the powerful military, amount to roughly 6 percent of GDP.The IMF report also flags governance risks linked to the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), created in June 2023 to promote investment and comprising both civilian and military leaders.The GCDA raises concerns over broad legal immunity granted to SIFC officials and the council’s authority to exempt projects from regulatory requirements.“The recently established Special Investment Facilitation Council, which has been vested with substantial authority to facilitate foreign investments, operates with untested transparency and accountability provisions,” the IMF report said.The Fund urged greater transparency, including annual public reporting on investments facilitated and concessions granted.The World Bank has warned that macroeconomic stabilisation has not translated into meaningful improvements in living standards.""Business as usual is not good for the economy,"" said Mukhtar Ul Hasan, World Bank economist and lead author of a report on Pakistan.""Pakistan's growth potential has been declining for decades"" due to weak competitiveness, limited reforms and recurring crises, he added.The World Bank projects growth of 3% this year and 3.4% next year, far below what is needed to absorb 1.6 million new labour market entrants annually.The Bank’s poverty and resilience report shows poverty rising again to over 27% by 2023–24, with nearly half the population living below the lower-middle-income poverty line. Rural areas, especially Balochistan and interior Sindh, face far greater deprivation.Geopolitics has added new economic risks.After a Pakistan-sponsored terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 civilians, India answered strongly to its misadventure by putting the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance. Islamabad responded by warning that any attempt to stop or divert water flows would be treated as an ""act of war.""Around 80% of Pakistani farms depend on the Indus system, as do nearly all hydropower projects. India had also identified hydropower projects in Jammu and Kashmir that could expand capacity to 12,000 MW from the current 3,360 MW, according to Reuters.In May 2025 India’s crossborder counterterror action under Operation Sindoor, marked a sharp escalation in India-Pakistan security dynamics. Military operations and reciprocal measures elevate defence spending, crowd out development spending, spook investors, and raise insurance and logistics costs for trade.Pakistan suffered a major setback after Indian strikes severely damaged nine of its key airbases, including Nur Khan and Rahim Yar Khan, dealing a significant blow to its military infrastructure.Pakistan’s economic capacity has been heavily drained by sustained military expenditure driven by its adversarial policies toward India, a burden that has come at the cost of investment in social sectors and has pushed the country down across multiple human development indicators.Reports indicate Afghanistan's new dam projects on rivers that feed Pakistan (Kunar/Kabul tributaries) will further diminish cross-border flows into Pakistan’s north-west. Combined with India’s measures, this convergence would be a ""double blast"" to Pakistani water security — concentrated in already drought-prone provinces that supply major agricultural output.Reduced river flows affect irrigation, livelihoods and hydroelectricity; they also fuel internal migration pressures and raise the social cost of adjustment. Regional cooperation mechanisms for water management have weakened, making unilateral upstream development a direct economic shock for downstream Pakistan.Pakistan’s economy is surviving due to IMF support, tactical policy moves, selective foreign investment and geopolitical manoeuvring, including heavy dependence on China and US.But without deep structural reform, dismantling elite privilege and restoring institutional accountability, survival may continue without delivering broad-based prosperity, leaving the country trapped in the same cycle of crisis and rescue that has defined its economic history.","Pakistan narrowly avoided default in 2023 only after the IMF extended an earlier nine-month emergency deal. Since 1958, Pakistan has turned to the IMF 25 times, making it one of the IMF's most borrowers.

Trump Puts Asim Munir On Gaza Test: Can Pak Army Chief Appease U.S & Avoid Backlash At Home?

'Pressure to deliver'

Munir's unprecedented power

Risks at home





Pakistan's de facto state head and most powerful army chief in decades is facing the toughest test of his expanding stronghold in Islamabad power centre as the United States presses Islamabad to send troops to a Gaza stabilisation force, a move analysts told Reuters could spark strong domestic backlash. It could also ""annoy the US president"" if Munir shows disinterest in contributing to the peace plan.Military chief Munir, who holds enormous influenceover Pakistan's political and economic decisions, is expected to travel to Washington in the coming weeks to meet US President Donald Trump . It would be their third meeting in six months and is likely to focus on Pakistan's possible role in Gaza, according to two sources familiar with the matter, one of whom is closely involved in Munir’s economic outreach to the US.Trump's proposed 20-point plan for Gaza calls for troops from Muslim-majority countries to oversee a transition period focused on reconstruction and economic recovery in the Palestinian territory. Gaza has been devastated by more than two years of Israeli military bombardment.Many countries are cautious about joining such a force because it could involve disarming Hamas, Gaza's Islamist militant group. Analysts say this risks pulling foreign troops deeper into the conflict and could inflame pro-Palestinian and anti-Israeli public opinion at home.Munir, however, has developed close ties with Trump as part of an effort to repair years of strained relations between Washington and Islamabad. In June, Trump hosted Munir for a private lunch at the White House — the first time a US president met Pakistan’s army chief alone, without any civilian leaders present.""Not contributing (to the Gaza stabilisation force) could annoy Trump, which is no small matter for a Pakistani state that appears quite keen to remain in his good graces - in great part to secure U.S. investment and security aid,"" said Michael Kugelman, Senior Fellow, South Asia at the Washington-based Atlantic Council.Pakistan is the world's only Muslim-majority country with nuclear weapons and has a powerful, experienced military. It has fought three wars with rival India, a brief conflict earlier this year, and has long battled insurgencies in its remote regions. It is also currently fighting Islamist militants that it says operate from neighbouring Afghanistan.Because of this military capability, expectations are higher for Pakistan to contribute, said defence analyst and author Ayesha Siddiqa.Pakistan’s military strength means ""there is a greater pressure on Munir to deliver his capacity,"" she said.Pakistan’s military, foreign office and information ministry did not respond to Reuters’ questions. The White House also did not reply to a request for comment.Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said last month that Pakistan could consider contributing troops for peacekeeping, but made clear that disarming Hamas was not Islamabad’s responsibility.Earlier this month, Munir was appointed chief of the defence forces, placing the army, air force and navy under his command. He also received a job extension until 2030.Under constitutional amendments passed by Pakistan’s civilian government last month, Munir will retain his field marshal rank for life and enjoy lifetime immunity from criminal prosecution.""Few people in Pakistan enjoy the luxury of being able to take risks more than Munir. He has unbridled power, now constitutionally protected,"" Kugelman said.In recent weeks, Munir has met leaders from Indonesia, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Jordan, Egypt and Qatar, according to military statements. Siddiqa said these meetings appear aimed at consulting Muslim countries on the proposed Gaza force.At home, however, the biggest risk is political unrest. Any deployment of Pakistani troops to Gaza under a US-backed plan could revive protests by Islamist parties that strongly oppose the US and Israel.These groups have the ability to bring thousands of supporters onto the streets.In October, authorities banned a powerful and violent Islamist party known for pushing Pakistan’s strict blasphemy laws. Officials said its leaders were arrested, more than 1,500 supporters detained, and its assets and bank accounts seized. Despite the ban, analysts say the group’s ideology still has influence.Supporters of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan, whose party won the most seats in the 2024 elections, are also deeply hostile to Munir and could mobilise against him.Abdul Basit, Senior Associate Fellow at Singapore’s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, warned that any escalation after deployment could quickly spiral.""People will say 'Asim Munir is doing Israel's bidding' - it will be foolhardy of anyone not to see it coming.""",Pakistan's de facto state head and most powerful army chief in decades is facing the toughest test of his expanding stronghold in Islamabad power centre.

Pakistan’s Asim Munir Threatens India With 'Severe Response' In First Speech After Becoming CDF





In a first since partition, a course on ancient language Sanskrit has been introduced in a university in Pakistan, The Tribune reported. The Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS) has introduced the course, with Hindu mythologies like Mahabharat and Gita on the cards too.“People ask me why I’m learning Sanskrit. I tell them, why should we not learn it? It is the binding language of the entire region. Sanskrit grammarian Panini’s village was in this region. Much writing was done here during the Indus Valley Civilisation. Sanskrit is like a mountain--a cultural monument. We need to own it. It is ours too; it’s not tied to any one particular religion,” The Tribune quoted associate professor, Shahid Rasheed, who is at the heart of the initiative saying.“A significant collection of Sanskrit palm-leaf manuscripts were catalogued in the 1930s by scholar JCR Woolner, but no Pakistani academic has engaged with this collection since 1947. Only foreign researchers use it. Training scholars locally will change that,” the news outlet quoted the director of the Gurmani Centre, Ali Usman Qasmi, saying.“In 10-15 years, we could see Pakistan-based scholars of the Gita and the Mahabharata,” Qasmi added.The Sanskrit course began as a three-month weekend workshop only to eventually become a four-credit university course after it received an overwhelming response.“After we saw the response, we decided to introduce it as a proper university course. Even though the number of students is still small, we hope it will grow over the next few years. Ideally, by spring 2027, we should be able to teach the language as a year-long course,” the director said.","A course on ancient language Sanskrit has been introduced in a university in Pakistan.

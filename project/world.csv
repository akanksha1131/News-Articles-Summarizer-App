North Korea opens massive beach resort: state media,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/north-korea-opens-massive-beach-resort-state-media/articleshow/122195945.cms,"Representative image





SEOUL: North Korea opened a massive resort area on its east coast, state media said Wednesday, with the tourism pet project of leader Kim Jong Un reportedly set to welcome Russian guests this month.Dubbed ""North Korea's Waikiki"" by South Korean media, the Wonsan Kalma Coastal Tourist area can accommodate nearly 20,000 people, according to Pyongyang, which previously described it as ""a world-class cultural resort"".Kim showed a keen interest in developing North Korea's tourism industry during his early years in power, analysts have said, and the coastal resort area was a particular focus.The tourist zone opened to domestic visitors Tuesday, Pyongyang's official Korean Central News Agency reported, publishing images of tourists in colourful swimsuits enjoying the beach.North Koreans of all ages from across the country flocked to the site this week ""filled with joy at experiencing a new level of civilization"", KCNA reported.The visitors were ""astonished by the grandeur and splendor of the tourist city, where more than 400... artistically designed buildings lined the white sandy beach in ideal harmony"", it added.According to South Korea's Yonhap news agency, a group of Russian tourists is set to visit the zone in North Korea for the first time on July 7.South Korea's unification ministry, which manages relations with the North, said the site's operations are ""expected to gradually expand"", including to Russian tourists.Kim said last week the construction of the site would go down as ""one of the greatest successes this year"" and that the North would build more large-scale tourist zones ""in the shortest time possible"".Previously released images showed him sitting in a chair, alongside his teenage daughter Ju Ae and wife Ri Sol Ju, watching a man flying off a water slide in the resort.But given the limited capacity of available flights, international tourism to the new beach resort is ""likely to remain small in scale,"" according to Seoul's unification ministry.""It is estimated that tourists will travel via Pyongyang, and that the number of visitors may be limited to around 170 people per day,"" the ministry said.North Korea sees tourism as a key source of foreign currency, it said, and Pyongyang may have received aid to complete the site from Russia in exchange for joining its war in Ukraine.The nuclear-armed North reopened its borders in August 2023 after almost four years, having closed them because of the Covid-19 pandemic, during which even its own nationals were prevented from entering.But foreign tourism was limited even before the pandemic, with tour companies saying around 5,000 Western tourists visited each year. Significantly more Chinese tourists were allowed at the time.The North last year permitted Russian tourists to return for the first time since the pandemic and Western tour operators returned in February this year. No Chinese tourists are known to have returned to the country.","The Wonsan Kalma Coastal Tourist area can accommodate nearly 20,000 people.

US defence 'made in China': Is Washington ready for war with Beijing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-defence-made-in-china-is-washington-ready-for-war-with-beijing-or-too-dependent-to-fight/articleshow/122195620.cms,"AI-generated image

Chinese parts in US defense



'US not prepared for war with China'







Despite years of warnings and efforts to decouple, the United States defense industrial base remains alarmingly reliant on China, the very nation it might one day have to confront in battle. A new report from data analytics firm Govini paints a sobering picture of America’s war readiness, raising the question: could the US actually sustain a conflict with China, or is it too entangled in its rival’s supply chains?The report reveals that Chinese firms supply nearly one in ten critical components for major US defense programs, including missile defense, nuclear systems, and space technology. It highlights how deeply Beijing’s industries are woven into America’s military supply chains, with particular reliance on Chinese-made parts in missile defense, and on critical minerals dominated by China’s production.According to Govini’s National Security Scorecard, released this week, Chinese firms made up 9.3% of primary contractors, known as Tier 1 suppliers, for major US defense programs across nine critical sectors in 2024. These sectors include aviation, maritime, command and control systems, nuclear, missile defense, and space.The report further noted how deeply Chinese suppliers were embedded in vital military supply chains.The missile defense sector, key to protecting the US from attack, had the highest reliance: 11.1% of Tier 1 suppliers were Chinese.Even the nuclear sector, where security stakes are at their highest, counted on Chinese suppliers for 7.8% of its components, more than any other foreign country.“The United States is not prepared for the war that we may have to enter if China said, ‘today is the day’,” South China Morning Post quoted Tara Dougherty, Govini’s CEO saying.While the dependence is clear, fully eliminating Chinese suppliers is not so simple. Dougherty cautioned against viewing decoupling as a silver bullet.“I’m not even sure that eradicating China from the supply chain is the right goal,” she said, adding, “I think it’s about dissecting these platforms into what’s critical and what’s not.”One area of particular concern was critical minerals, as per the report. It noted that hundreds of weapon systems, from jets to ships to missiles, depended on minerals like antimony, gallium, germanium, tungsten and tellurium.China dominates global production of these materials. In fact, Govini found that 78% of US weapon systems could be affected by Chinese export curbs on these minerals. This vulnerability was highlighted by Beijing’s recent restrictions on rare earth exports as part of its broader tech and trade tensions with Washington.","Chinese firms supply nearly one in ten critical components for major US defense programs.

Squalid life and India escape





Cindy Rodriguez Singh, wanted for the 2022 murder of her 6-year-old son, Noel Rodriguez Alvarez, has been added to the FBI’s Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list, federal officials announced Tuesday.The FBI has increased the reward for information leading to her arrest from $25,000 to $250,000.Joe Rothrock, special agent in charge of the FBI’s Dallas Field Office, said investigators remain committed to finding her. “The message to Cindy is we aren't going to stop [looking],” he said, according to CBS News.Authorities believe Rodriguez Singh fled the US and is currently in India with her husband, Arshdeep Singh , and six of her children. US agents are working with international partners to locate and extradite her.Just days after Noel was officially reported missing, Rodriguez Singh, her husband, and their other children boarded a one-way flight to India on March 22, 2023. Noel was not on that flight and has not been seen since.Rodriguez Singh was indicted by a Tarrant County grand jury in October 2023 on charges of capital murder and other offenses connected to Noel’s disappearance.Though Noel was last seen in November 2022, he wasn’t reported missing until March 2023.Tarrant County district attorney Phil Sorrels said, as reported by CBS News “Let me be clear, fleeing the country does not absolve you of guilt. It reinforces it,” he said.Authorities say Arshdeep Singh, Noel’s stepfather, is of Indian origin and also lived in the same structure. During the investigation, officials uncovered a series of false claims made by Rodriguez Singh about Noel’s whereabouts, including that he was in Mexico with relatives or had been sold to a stranger in a parking lot of a Fiesta grocery store.Noel was one of ten children born to Rodriguez Singh. While three siblings lived with grandparents, the rest, including Noel, lived in squalid conditions with their mother and stepfather in a filthy shed in Everman, a suburb of Fort Worth.Based on the inconsistencies, lack of credible evidence, and witness statements, investigators concluded that Noel was likely deceased.Everman city manager Craig Spencer, formerly the city’s police chief, has described Rodriguez Singh as having an “extensive criminal history.” She had previously been investigated by child protective services.Born in Dallas in 1985, Rodriguez Singh is now the first mother accused of killing her own child to be placed on the FBI’s ten most wanted list, which has included more than 500 of the most dangerous fugitives in US history.","Cindy Rodriguez Singh is wanted for the 2022 murder of her 6-year-old son, Noel Rodriguez Alvarez.

The US on Tuesday announced that it would suspend certain crucial arms deliveries to Ukraine, previously pledged under President Biden's administration, potentially impacting Kyiv's defence against Russian aggression.""This decision was made to put America's interests first following a DOD (department of defense) review of our nation's military support and assistance to other countries across the globe,"" White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly said in a statement, AFP reported.The Biden administration's previous commitments of munitions to Ukraine have been paused under President Donald Trump's leadership, following defence department assessments of US stockpiles and shifting priorities.This follows Trump's recent directive for US missile strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities.A US official, speaking anonymously, revealed that Pentagon reviews found insufficient stocks of certain promised weapons, leading to the cancellation of some planned deliveries. The specific weapons affected remain undisclosed.Spokesman Sean Parnell emphasised US military readiness, noting that pending legislation would enhance defence capabilities against contemporary threats.This suspension of US weapons support impacts Ukraine during intensified Russian aerial attacks, complicating Trump-backed peace initiatives. Diplomatic discussions have ceased.The US has delivered over $66 billion in military support to Ukraine since Russia's February 2022 invasion.At the Nato summit, Trump discussed potential Patriot air defence missile system deliveries with President Zelenskyy, acknowledging their effectiveness: ""They do want to have the antimissile missiles, OK, as they call them, the Patriots,"" Trump said then. ""And we're going to see if we can make some available. We need them, too. We're supplying them to Israel, and they're very effective, 100% effective. Hard to believe how effective. They do want that more than any other thing.","The Biden administration's previous commitments of munitions to Ukraine have been paused under President Donald Trump's leadership.

Recall of probe report 'abnormal'







The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) blocked probe into the allegations of Chinese Communist Party meddling into the 2020 US presidential elections to benefit Joe Biden , aiming to shield then-FBI Director Christopher Wray as it would ""contradict"" his congressional testimony, Fox News Digital reported citing newly declassified FBI documents.The documents, containing exchanges between FBI officials prior to the 2020 election, were recently declassified by FBI director Kash Patel and sent to senate judiciary committee chair Chuck Grassley of Iowa.According to the report, Chinese government created “a large amount” of fake US driver’s licenses, generated using data from millions of TikTok users, “tens of thousands of Chinese students and immigrants sympathetic to the Chinese Communist Party to vote for US Presidential Candidate Joe Biden, despite not being eligible to vote in the United States,” the New York Post reported.Moreover, the FBI’s Albany field office reported the plot from a credible source, but FBI headquarters ""suppressed"" the report, partly because it would ""contradict"" director Wray’s congressional testimony claiming no coordinated national voter fraud.Internal communications showed Albany staff protested the suppression, warning that political motives were influencing intelligence handling and that the suppression prevented other agencies from vetting the information.Details of the alleged meddling were shared in an FBI Intelligence Information Report (IIR) on September 25, 2020, just a day after Wray told Congress the bureau had no knowledge of any “coordinated national voter fraud effort”. The report, however, was withdrawn within minutes of being released.Calling the move ""abnormal"", FBI assistant director Marshall Yates, in a letter to Chuck Grassley earlier this year said, “Based on conversations with key individuals involved, it was conveyed that the recall of the IIR was abnormal.”Yates had said that the probe report had ""prompted significant attention throughout FBI Headquarters"" and ""the recall was issued to 'reinterview' the source.""""The rationale provided to Albany staff for the recall was that Headquarters deemed the report not 'authoritative,' but this characterization was met with disagreement by those in the Albany office. Internal emails reflect that Albany staff had concerns that suppressing the IIR would be 'dangerous if we cite potential political implications as reasons for not putting out our information,' emphasizing that it was not the role of analysts to align intelligence with public testimony,"" he wrote in the letter.","Recall of probe report 'abnormal' says FBI assistant director Marshall Yates.

Wess Roley's tumultuous childhood







20-year-old Wess Roley who lured firefighters after starting a brush fire intentionally in Idaho and then killed two firefighters when they responded to the fire, had a disturbing childhood, CNN reported, citing court documents. As soon as the shooter was identified as Wess Roley, social media was abuzz with a purported photo of his parents (mother and stepfather) sporting MAGA hats. While the veracity of most of the social media claims are not known, Wess Roley's grandfather spoke to CNN and said he was not a loner and had no reason to be involved in something like this.Wess Roley who was found dead at the fire scene himself wanted to be a firefighter, his grandfather said. “He wanted to be a fireman – he was doing tree work and he wanted to be a fireman in the forest,” Dale Roley said. “As far as I know, he was actually pursuing it.”Dale Roley said he typically spoke with his grandson on a weekly basis, but they hadn’t spoken in the last month because Wess Roley had lost his phone. He said the suspect had loving family and friends, and he vacationed in Hawaii with his mother last year, according to social media posts.He said he was holding out hope that his grandson was not the actual shooter.CNN cited court documents claiming that Roley's mother filed for divorce in 2015 when Roley was 10 years old. In court documents, she wrote that Roley's father threatened her, pushed her to the ground and ""pinched several holes in the walls"".“He threatened to sit outside my house with a sniper rifle or burn my house down,” she wrote.The divorce was granted in two months and Roley's mother became the primary residential parent. His father was initially prevented from having contact with his wife or son but the order was later amended.Roley's father told CNN that he was not close with his son and hadn't seen him since a family gathering last year.","20-year-old Wess Roley lured firefighters after starting a brush fire intentionally in Idaho and then killed two firefighters when they responded to the fire.

In a significant move to strengthen its position as a global hub for innovation and skilled professionals, the United Arab Emirates has announced the expansion of its prestigious Golden Visa program.

Professionals from diverse fields including healthcare, education, digital content, e-sports, and maritime luxury can now access long-term residency benefits without employer sponsorship, making the UAE an increasingly attractive destination for global talent and their families.The UAE’s Golden Visa program, originally launched in 2019, now encompasses a broader range of professionals with the aim of accelerating economic diversification and attracting knowledge-based talent. The five newly introduced categories are:On May 12, 2025, coinciding with International Nurses Day, Dubai Health, under the directive of Sheikh Hamdan, announced 10-year visas for nurses with over 15 years of service. This decision honours the critical role of nurses in healthcare, especially as Dubai receives around 3.7 million medical tourists annually, according to Dubai Health Authority (DHA) data.Private school teachers, principals, and university academic staff in Dubai and Ras Al Khaimah are now eligible for the visa. The Knowledge and Human Development Authority (KHDA) in Dubai and RAK DOK in Ras Al Khaimah manage the scheme, which recognizes academic excellence and allows for family sponsorship.The initiative aims to elevate the UAE’s already strong educational system, which ranks 10th globally per UNESCO.Launched at the, the creative residency track targets filmmakers and social media influencers.

14 million lives at risk: USAID cuts trigger global health alarm; Lancet study warns,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/14-million-lives-at-risk-usaid-cuts-trigger-global-health-alarm-lancet-study-warns/articleshow/122173336.cms,"A study in The Lancet reveals that steep cuts to USAID funding could lead to over 14 million additional deaths globally by 2030, reversing decades of progress in combating diseases like HIV/AIDS and malaria.

The Lancet





Steep cuts in funding for the US Agency for International Development (USAID) threaten to cause more than 14 million additional deaths worldwide by 2030, according to a study published inon Monday.Researchers analysed mortality data from 133 low‑ and middle‑income countries spanning 2001‑2021 and calculated that USAID‑backed health programmes had prevented about 91.8 million deaths in those two decades. The modelling suggests that the current wave of cuts would erase much of that progress, potentially leading to 1.78 million–2.5 million excess deaths each year between 2025 and 2030.“This structural defunding could represent one of the most significant setbacks to global health in decades,” said co‑author Davide Rasella of the Barcelona Institute for Global Health. “It risks causing millions of preventable deaths, particularly among the most vulnerable, and reversing progress in health and socio‑economic development.”The paper attributes the largest share of historic lives saved to USAID’s work on HIV/Aids, estimating a near two‑thirds fall in related deaths—about 25.5 million people—over the study period. Programmes tackling malaria, diarrhoeal diseases, neglected tropical diseases and lower respiratory infections were credited with saving another 31 million lives.But that track record is under threat. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio told Congress in March that 83 per cent of USAID projects would be terminated, with the remainder folded into the State Department. USAID spent roughly $42.4 billion in 2023, yet the agency’s long‑term budget outlook remains uncertain as some cutbacks face court challenges.The shift follows comments last year by former presidential adviser Elon Musk, who boasted that USAID funding had been fed “into the wood chipper”. The consequences have already started to ripple: US Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr announced last week an end to Washington’s $300 million annual contribution to Gavi, the international vaccine alliance historically channelled through USAID.",Steep cuts in funding for the US Agency for International Development threaten to cause more than 14 million additional deaths worldwide by 2030.

California attorney general Rob Bonta announced Tuesday that the state, along with 19 other attorneys general, is suing the federal government over the release of Medicaid data to deportation officials.The lawsuit claims that the Trump administration violated federal privacy laws when it handed over the private health information of millions of enrollees to deportation officials last month, reported AP.The data, which included names, addresses, Social Security numbers, immigration status and claims records, was shared by order of advisors to health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr. It covered individuals in California, Illinois, and both Washington State and Washington, DC.These states allow noncitizens to enrol in Medicaid programs funded solely by state taxpayer dollars. The sharing of data came as immigration enforcement increased efforts nationwide.A spokesperson for the department of health and human services (HHS), Andrew Nixon, defended the move, saying, “HHS acted entirely within its legal authority- and in full compliance with all applicable laws- to ensure that Medicaid benefits are reserved for individuals who are lawfully entitled to receive them.”","The data included names, addresses, Social Security numbers, immigration status and claims records.

The Senate on Tuesday approved the latest version of President Donald Trump’s sweeping tax and immigration spending package, with Vice President JD Vance casting the decisive tie-breaking vote following an all-night session. As the legislation now moves to the House, it faces mounting scrutiny over provisions that propose the most significant rollback of Medicaid in the program’s 58-year history.The reconciliation bill includes more than $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts over the next decade, a move that has drawn rare public criticism from within the Republican Party. Speaking in the Senate over the weekend, Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina questioned the impact on his constituents. “What do I tell 663,000 people in two years, three years,” he asked, “when President Trump breaks his promise by pushing them off of Medicaid because the funding’s not there anymore?”According to projections by researchers from the University of Pennsylvania, Harvard, and Yale, the toll could be far worse than just the loss of health insurance. Their analysis estimates that the proposed Medicaid reductions could result in over 51,000 additional deaths each year, particularly affecting those who are elderly, poor, or chronically ill.Currently, Medicaid provides coverage to approximately 1 in 5 Americans, including low-income families, people with disabilities, and elderly residents in long-term care. Among the most vulnerable are the 13 million dual-eligible individuals who receive both Medicare and Medicaid benefits.These individuals depend on Medicaid subsidies to afford life-saving medications. Researchers estimate that 18,200 dual-eligible individuals could die annually if those subsidies are withdrawn.The bill also introduces work requirements for most nonelderly adult Medicaid recipients and ends enhanced premium tax credits under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplaces. A separate study by Yale researchers projects that these changes could result in more than 20,000 additional deaths each year due to loss of insurance coverage.Another provision of the bill delays implementation of new nursing home staffing standards by a decade. Based on studies linking nurse staffing to resident mortality, researchers at the University of Pennsylvania estimate that the delay could lead to an additional 13,000 deaths annually among nursing home residents.Experts warn that the real-world impact of these cuts will extend far beyond coverage statistics. States, unlike the federal government, must operate with balanced budgets, and the deep reduction in federal Medicaid funding will likely compel governors and legislatures to scale back benefits, reduce eligibility, or impose time limits on coverage. Rural and urban healthcare providers—including hospitals and clinics—are also expected to bear the brunt, with many potentially forced to cut services or shut down.Also read | Why Trump's ‘Big Beautiful Bill’ matters: What’s inside, what it means, and why the fight was so fierce","The Senate on Tuesday approved the latest version of President Donald Trump’s sweeping tax and immigration spending package.

Donald Trump said as the president he will have to arrest Zohran Mamdani if he becomes the New York mayor and then blocks ICE from doing its work. Mamdani has won the democratic primary and to become the New York mayor, he will have to win the general election in November. But Trump has already threatened that he will cut federal funds to NYC, arrest Mamdani -- if the socialist does not cooperate with the Trump administration, if and when he becomes the NYC mayor.Trump was asked about Zohran Mamdani's election promise that he would defy ICE and would not allow ICE to arrest criminal aliens in New York City. ""Well then we'll have just to arrest him. Look, we don't need a communist in this country but if we have one, I'm going to be watching over him very carefully on behalf of the nation. We send him money, we send him all the things that he needs to run a government and by the way, they get already about three times what you get. If you look at per capita, Florida gets one-third of what New York gets,"" Trump said as he hosted an immigration roundtable at New Florida Detention Facility.""A lot of people are saying he (Mamdani) is here illegally. You know we are going to look over everything. And ideally, he's going to turn out to be much less than a communist but right now he's a communist.That's not a socialist,"" Trump said.Mamdani earlier reacted to Donald Trump calling him a communist and said the president wants to distract from what he's fighting for. ""I've already had to start to get used to the fact that the president will talk about how I look, how I sound, where I'm from, who I am,"" Mamdani said on Mee the Press on June 29.""He wants to distract from what I'm fighting for,"" Mamdani said. ""I'm fighting for the very working people he ran a campaign to empower that he has since then betrayed.""Trump earlier said Mamdani would be ""very unsuccessful"" if he tries to keep New York a sanctuary city. ""If he does get in, I'm going to be president and he's going to have to do the right thing or they're not getting any money. He's got to do the right thing,"" Trump said.

‘Go Back To Third World’: Zohran Mamdani MOCKED For Eating With Hands By Trump Aide

What is the row over eating rice with hands?







Without naming NYC mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, Harmeet K Dhillon, the assistant attorney general for civil rights at the US Department of Justice, waded into the rice controversy as she shared a photo of rice and lentils in two different pots with spoons in both of them. ""Mom sent me home from the weekend with daal and rice...which I'm hearing and eating with a spoon -- not like some like some performance artist LARPing philistine!"" Dhillon, who was born in India (Punjab) wrote.A major controversy broke out as a video of Zohran Mamdani eating rice with his hand went viral. The anti-Mamdani sentiments soon turned into anti-India as eating with hands is an accepted form of eating in India.GOP leader, Congressman Brandon Gill called Mamdani uncivilized as he pointed out that civilized people in America don't eat with their hands. ""If you refuse to adopt Western customs, go back to the Third World,"" Gill wrote. The Congressman was reminded that his wife is of Indian-origin and she definitely eats with her hand.Brandon Gill's wife Danielle D'Souza Gill joined the debate and said she did not grow up eating rice with her hands and always used a fork.""I did not grow up eating rice with my hands and have always used a fork. I was born in America. I’m a Christian MAGA patriot. My father’s extended family lives in India and they are also Christian and they use forks too,"" Danielle wrote.Danielle's father Dinesh D'Souza, a Conservative commentator who was born in India, said eating with hands is gross in America, but not in India. Reating to a now viral photo of him eating with his hand, D'Souza wrote: ""My culture lesson for Mamdani: Eating with your hands is acceptable when it’s bread, naan or pizza. Not when it’s soup, meatloaf or mashed potatoes. Indians sometimes eat rice with their hands in India, but it’s much more common in rural areas. In America, it’s considered gross.""Mamdani's video grossed many Americans out but a section of social media users debated that it was not eating with hand that disgusted them but Mamdani choosing to do so for a video while he definitely does not use his hands always for eating came across as performative modesty that Mamdani was aiming at.","Harmeet K Dhillon, the assistant attorney general for civil rights at the US Department of Justice, shared a photo of rice and lentils in two different pots with spoons in both of them.

Major reports about how climate change affects the US are removed from websites,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/major-reports-about-how-climate-change-affects-the-us-are-removed-from-websites/articleshow/122189311.cms,"



WASHINGTON: Legally mandated US national climate assessments seem to have disappeared from the federal websites built to display them, making it harder for state and local governments and the public to learn what to expect in their backyards from a warming world.Scientists said the peer-reviewed authoritative reports save money and lives. Websites for the national assessments and the US Global Change Research Program were down Monday and Tuesday with no links, notes or referrals elsewhere. The White House, which was responsible for the assessments, said the information will be housed within NASA to comply with the law, but gave no further details.Searches for the assessments on NASA websites did not turn them up. NASA did not respond to requests for information. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which coordinated the information in the assessments, did not respond to repeated inquiries.""It's critical for decision makers across the country to know what the science in the National Climate Assessment is. That is the most reliable and well-reviewed source of information about climate that exists for the United States,"" said University of Arizona climate scientist Kathy Jacobs, who coordinated the 2014 version of the report.""It's a sad day for the United States if it is true that the National Climate Assessment is no longer available,"" Jacobs said. ""This is evidence of serious tampering with the facts and with people's access to information, and it actually may increase the risk of people being harmed by climate-related impacts.""Harvard climate scientist John Holdren, who was President Obama's science advisor and whose office directed the assessments, said after the 2014 edition he visited governors, mayors and other local officials who told him how useful the 841-page report was. It helped them decide whether to raise roads, build seawalls and even move hospital generators from basements to roofs, he said.""This is a government resource paid for by the taxpayer to provide the information that really is the primary source of information for any city, state or federal agency who's trying to prepare for the impacts of a changing climate,"" said Texas Tech climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe, who has been a volunteer author for several editions of the report.Copies of past reports are still squirreled away in NOAA's library. NASA's open science data repository includes dead links to the assessment site.The most recent report, issued in 2023, included an interactive atlas that zoomed down to the county level. It found that climate change is affecting people's security, health and livelihoods in every corner of the country in different ways, with minority and Native American communities often disproportionately at risk.The 1990 Global Change Research Act requires a national climate assessment every four years and directs the president to establish an interagency United States Global Change Research Program. In the spring, the Trump administration told the volunteer authors of the next climate assessment that their services weren't needed and ended the contract with the private firm that helps coordinate the website and report.Additionally, NOAA's main climate.gov website was recently forwarded to a different NOAA website. Social media and blogs at NOAA and NASA about climate impacts for the general public were cut or eliminated.""It's part of a horrifying big picture,"" Holdren said. ""It's just an appalling whole demolition of science infrastructure.""The national assessments are more useful than international climate reports put out by the United Nations every seven or so years because they are more localized and more detailed, Hayhoe and Jacobs said.The national reports are not only peer reviewed by other scientists, but examined for accuracy by the National Academy of Sciences, federal agencies, the staff and the public.Hiding the reports would be censoring science, Jacobs said.And it's dangerous for the country, Hayhoe said, comparing it to steering a car on a curving road by only looking through the rearview mirror: ""And now, more than ever, we need to be looking ahead to do everything it takes to make it around that curve safely. It's like our windshield's being painted over.""","Scientists say the peer-reviewed authoritative reports save money and lives.

"Zohran Mamdani defeats Andrew Cuomo in NYC Democratic Mayoral Primary, advances to general election; could become first Muslim, Indian-American to hold post",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/zohran-mamdani-defeats-andrew-cuomo-in-nyc-democratic-mayoral-primary-advances-to-general-election-could-become-first-muslim-indian-american-to-hold-post/articleshow/122188514.cms,"



NEW YORK: Zohran Mamdani has officially secured victory in New York City’s Democratic mayoral primary, with a final vote count on Tuesday confirming his upset win over former Governor Andrew Cuomo. He now advances to the general election.Since Mamdani took a decisive lead following the polls closing a week ago and narrowly missed the 50 per cent of the vote required to prevent a second count under the city's ranked choice voting system, his victory had been anticipated, news agency Associated Press reported.If a voter's favorite candidate withdraws from the race, the method permits their alternative preferences to be taken into consideration.In the general election, Mamdani, who announced his victory on the evening of the June 24 primary, will compete against incumbent Mayor Eric Adams, Republican Curtis Sliwa, and independent Jim Walden.On the evening of the primary on June 24, Cuomo admitted defeat, but he is still debating whether to run on an independent ticket in the general election.Mamdani, a democratic socialist who is 33 years old and a member of the state Assembly, was almost unknown when he ran for office with a daring list of populist policies.However, as the elder, more moderate Democrat attempted to recover from the sexual harassment crisis that forced his departure four years ago, he created a dynamic campaign that ran circles around Cuomo.The political world was rocked by the results even before they were confirmed.Mamdani's campaign, which aimed to reduce living expenses, says it has discovered a new path for Democrats who have occasionally seemed lost during President Donald Trump's ascent to power.The Democratic establishment has been cautious in its attitude to Mamdani.Although many of its major players praised his campaign, they don't appear prepared to fully support the young progressive. For some in the party, his previous criticisms of law enforcement, use of the word ""genocide"" to describe the actions of the Israeli government in Gaza, and designation as a ""democratic socialist"" are like landmines.Mamdani would be the first mayor of Indian American descent and the first Muslim in the city if elected. He would be among its youngest as well.Mamdani has already given Republicans a fresh line of attack. Ahead of important elections later this year and next, Trump and other GOP figures have started to take aim at Mamdani, portraying him as the pinnacle of socialist excess.According to Syracuse University political science professor Grant Reeher, ""I want this guy to win if I'm a Republican."" ""Because I want to be able to compare and contrast my campaign as a Republican with the notion that the Democratic party is in this position in a national election.""The ranked choice voting system in New York City enables voters to rank up to five candidates on their ballots. A candidate is declared the winner of the race if more than 50% of voters select them as their first choice.On the night of the primary, no candidate was able to clear that hurdle; therefore, the ranked-choice voting method took over. On July 15, the board is expected to certify the election.Since joining the state Assembly in 2021, Mamdani has described his lack of experience as a possible strength.In exchange for taxes on the wealthy, his campaign promised free city buses, free child care, government-run grocery shops, a rent freeze for rent-stabilized apartments, and more.His plan has been criticized for being politically unfeasible.Cuomo launched a campaign that focused on his wealth of experience, positioning himself as the one contender who could turn around a city that had gotten out of hand.He prioritized fighting antisemitism during the campaign and relied more on his well-known brand and successful fundraising effort than on engaging with voters.He denied any misconduct when confronted with the sexual harassment accusations that brought an end to his term as governor, arguing that the issue was motivated by politics and that voters were prepared to move on.Ahead of a procedural deadline to do so, Cuomo did not take his name off the November ballot last week. He has stated that he is still unsure about whether to run for government.Adams is an independent candidate in the November election, despite still being a Democrat. After being seriously hurt by his now-dismissed federal bribery case, he withdrew from the Democratic primary in April.In the days following Mamdani's declaration of victory, he rekindled his reelection campaign, despite having done little before. He referred to it as a contest between a candidate with a ""blue collar"" and one with a ""silver spoon.""","Zohran Mamdani defeated former Governor Andrew Cuomo in New York City's Democratic mayoral primary.

MINGORA, SWAT: Torrential rain triggered flash floods that tore through Pakistan’s northwestern Swat Valley over the weekend, killing at least 32 people and laying bare gaps in disaster preparedness in a region once ravaged by Taliban.Twelve members of one family were swept away while picnicking along the river in Swat, witnesses said. Phone videos showed relatives clinging to rocks, screaming for help as waters surged around them. “We kept dialling the emergency numbers, but no one came. By the time they did, it was too late… we were pulling out bodies,” local vendor Kabeer said.The family had travelled from Mardan and remained trapped for over an hour with no rescue teams arriving. “This valley has lived through terrorists, military operations, and devastating floods. Every time, we’re promised lessons will be learned, but nothing ever really changes,” said Khan Sher, a resident of Mingora, recalling Taliban control before the 2009 army offensive and the devastation of the 2010 floods.Heavy rain pounded Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab, and Balochistan, causing widespread destruction. “Flash floods caught us off-guard in Swat.We’ve retrieved 16 bodies so far from the river. Rescue operations are ongoing,” a rescue official said.Swat, now a bustling tourist hub, largely escaped the catastrophic 2022 floods that killed over 1,700 nationwide. This time, towns like Bahrain and Kalam, packed with riverside hotels, had little buffer when waters surged. Entire stretches transformed into danger zones within minutes.Pakistan has championed climate justice on global stages, yet its domestic disaster response remains stretched thin. “Each year we mourn our dead, patch up the roads, and brace for the next disaster,” said Liaquat Bacha, a farmer whose fields were washed away.","Torrential rain triggered flash floods that tore through Pakistan’s northwestern Swat Valley over the weekend.

At least 45 people have been killed across Pakistan as heavy rain and flash floods battered multiple regions since the start of the monsoon season, disaster management officials said on Sunday. The death toll includes a large number of children, underscoring the human cost of intensifying climate-related disasters in the country.The worst-hit was the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, bordering Afghanistan, where 21 people, including 10 children, lost their lives. The Swat Valley alone accounted for 14 deaths, where local media reported that a flash flood swept away families gathered near a riverbank.In Punjab, Pakistan’s most populous province located along the Indian border, 13 people have died since Wednesday. Officials said eight of them were children, killed when walls or roofs collapsed during intense rainfall. The remaining victims were caught in sudden floods.Another 11 fatalities have been reported in Sindh and Balochistan, further highlighting the widespread impact of the seasonal downpour.The Pakistan Meteorological Department has warned that heavy rainfall and the risk of flash floods will persist until at least Saturday, urging residents in vulnerable areas to take precautions.This latest tragedy follows a string of extreme weather events in Pakistan. Just last month, 32 people were killed in violent storms, and earlier in the year, the country faced hailstorms and unusual temperature shifts during spring.With a population of over 240 million, Pakistan ranks among the world’s most climate-vulnerable nations. Scientists and disaster experts have repeatedly warned that climate change is accelerating the frequency and severity of extreme weather, putting millions at risk in the region.Rescue and relief efforts are ongoing, and authorities have appealed for public vigilance as the monsoon deepens.","At least 45 people have been killed across Pakistan as heavy rain and flash floods battered multiple regions. The death toll includes a large number of children, underscoring the human cost of intensifying climate-related disasters in the country. The worst-hit was the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where 21 people, including 10 children, lost their lives.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122145350,imgsize-175544,width-400,resizemode-4/122145350.jpg"

Another earthquake struck Pakistan on Sunday morning, with 4.5 magnitude, said the National Center for Seismology (NCS). This is the second quake that hit the nation in the same dayThe quake occurred at a shallow depth of 10 kilometers, which makes it prone to aftershocks and can cause stronger ground shaking.The NCS shared the details in a post on X, “EQ of M: 4.5, On: 29/06/2025 08:02:51 IST, Lat: 30.24 N, Long: 69.86 E, Depth: 10 Km, Location: Pakistan.”There were no immediate reports of injuries or major damage. Authorities are continuing to monitor the situation, and further details are awaited.Earlier during the day, a stronger earthquake of magnitude 5.2 had also struck the country. It occurred at a depth of 150 kilometers.Prior to these two events, another earthquake measuring 4.4 on the Richter scale hit the region on June 15. Like Sunday’s later tremor, it was also shallow, recorded at a depth of 10 kilometers.Shallow earthquakes tend to be more dangerous than deeper ones because their seismic waves have less distance to travel before reaching the surface. This leads to stronger ground shaking, which can cause greater structural damage and increase the risk of casualties.Pakistan is among the most seismically active nations in the world, as it is crisscrossed by several major fault lines. As a result, earthquakes occur frequently and are often severe.Geologically, Pakistan sits at the intersection of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates. The provinces of Balochistan, the federally administered tribal areas, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Gilgit-Baltistan lie along the southern edge of the Eurasian plate, while Sindh, Punjab, and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir are located on the northwestern edge of the Indian plate.The ongoing collision between these plates makes the region highly susceptible to powerful earthquakes.","The quake occurred at a shallow depth of 10 kilometers, which makes it prone to aftershocks and can cause stronger ground shaking.

Heart-wrenching footage has emerged showing several people stranded on a narrow elevated strip in the middle of Pakistan's Swat River, moments before a deadly flash flood swept them away on Friday morning.The video, which went viral across social media platforms, captures their desperate cries for help as torrents of water surge around them.At least nine people from a single extended family lost their lives in the tragedy, according to Geo TV.The victims, including children, had gathered near the riverbank for breakfast while on a leisure trip from Sialkot. According to officials, the group was unaware of the sudden rise in water levels caused by heavy rains upstream.“They were taking selfies, and there wasn’t much water at the time,” said a family member, as quoted by news agency Reuters. “Suddenly, a massive wave came and swept them all away”, the member added.As per Swat deputy commissioner Shehzad Mehboob, 17 individuals were caught in the floodwaters. “We have recovered nine bodies so far and rescued four people alive. The search for the remaining four is ongoing,” he was quoted as saying by Geo News.Among the dead were women and children. Residents said it took over two hours for rescue teams to arrive at the scene.The devastating moment prompted an outpouring of grief in Sialkot, where the bodies of seven victims were received by wailing family members. “My children were calling for help in front of my eyes. We couldn’t save them,” said a distraught relative.The Pakistan Army has since joined local rescue teams, while the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government has ordered a high-level inquiry to investigate the lapses. The committee has been given seven days to submit its report and recommend preventive measures.According to Reuters, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority has warned of continued heavy rains and potential flash floods across northern Pakistan until next week.Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed sorrow over the tragedy, calling it a “painful reminder” of nature’s fury and urging tourists to follow safety advisories, as cited by Reuters.Heavy rains have affected parts of Pakistan since earlier this week, blocking highways and damaging homes.However, weather forecasters predict that the country will experience less rainfall compared to 2022, when climate-induced downpours caused rivers to swell and flooded one-third of Pakistan, resulting in 1,739 fatalities.","At least nine people from a single extended family lost their lives in the tragedy.

Local media reported that families had been swept away and that the flooding had damaged 56 houses along the Swat river.Pakistan's local daily newspaper Dawn reported that rescue operations were underway in several other districts with people trapped in the water.Meanwhile, the national meteorological department warned of heavy rainfall and a possibility of more flash floods until Tuesday.Pakistan is among the world's more vulnerable countries to the effect of climate change with an increasing frequency of flash floods and other climate-related events impacting its 240 million inhabitants.In May, some 24 people were killed in severe storms in Pakistan. In August 2022, a third of the country was flooded due to unprecedented monsoon rainfall with more than 33 million people affected. Scientists from across the globe have since said that the climate crisis was to blame and that rising global temperatures will only make monsoons more intense in future.Pakistan's former climate change minister Sherry Rehman took to X, saying that the nation continued to ""sleepwalk"" on climate change and the threat it posed. She pointed to regular alerts issued by the national disaster management agency and said that local authorities had failed to take them seriously.""Not only did the provincial administration fail to understand the magnitude of the crisis, I keep repeating, so did denialist tourists. This is endemic to a system that thinks that climate change can just be put on a back burner, or that crises will not multiply in scale and intensity,"" she wrote.""These are not ""natural disasters"" which absolve all actors of responsibility, local, national and global. Super monsoons and flash floods are not the norm. They have been intensifying for decades,"" she added, urging the country to ""wake up"" the to the issue.","Flash floods in Pakistan's northwest have killed 11 people, including four children.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a firm warning to Pakistan on Friday, saying that Iran must never be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons. The statement came during a call with Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif amid high tensions in the Middle East.“Secretary Rubio emphasised Iran can never develop or acquire a nuclear weapon,” said US State Department Spokesperson Tammy Bruce.According to Bruce, both leaders “acknowledged the importance of working together to promote a durable peace between Israel and Iran and maintaining regional stability.”The message to Islamabad comes at a sensitive time, as the country has historically tried to balance its ties with both Iran and the West. Rubio’s call comes just days after a major US military strike on Iran’s underground nuclear facilities.The strikes triggered political controversy in Islamabad which had just days earlier recommended US President Donald Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize.The nomination, signed by deputy Prime Minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar, praised Trump’s role in easing tensions with India. However, criticism erupted after Islamabad condemned the strikes as a breach of international law.JUI-F leader Maulana Fazlur Rehman demanded the nomination be withdrawn, calling Trump’s peace claims “false” and accusing him of backing Israeli aggression. Opposition figures, including Mushahid Hussain, slammed Trump for starting an “illegal war” and urged the government to revoke the nomination.PTI’s Raoof Hasan said the move brought “shame and embarrassment”, while other leaders, including Maleeha Lodhi and Afrasiab Khattak, labelled it undiplomatic and misguided.Pakistan’s foreign ministry issued a statement defending Iran’s right to self-defence under the UN Charter and warned of regional destabilisation. The backlash reflects a rapid shift from recent praise of Trump’s diplomacy.On June 22, the United States launched airstrikes targeting Iran’s nuclear infrastructure. Three critical sites — Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan — were struck using 30,000-pound GBU-57 “bunker buster” bombs, delivered by stealth B-2 bombers.On President Donald Trump’s orders, US Central Command carried out what the Pentagon described as a “deliberate and precise strike” to “severely degrade Iran’s nuclear weapons infrastructure.”“At approximately 6:40 PM EST, 2:10 am Iran time, the lead B-2 dropped GBU-57 MOP weapons on the first of several aim points at Fordow,” said General Dan Caine, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.The military operation followed Israel’s “Operation Rising Lion” on June 13 and Iran’s retaliatory “Operation True Promise 3.”","US Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a firm warning to Pakistan on Friday, saying that Iran must never be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons.

A Pakistan military officer who had claimed to have captured Indian Air Force pilot Abhinandan Varthaman was killed in a clash with Taliban militants in the Sararogha area of South Waziristan, near the Afghan border.According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), Major Syed Moiz Abbas Shah was killed along with Lance Naik Jibran Ullah during an operation against Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) fighters.ISPR added that the Pakistan Army killed 11 TTP militants and wounded seven others in the same operation.Major Moiz’s funeral prayers were held at Chaklala Garrison in Rawalpindi, with Pakistan Army Chief General Asim Munir in attendance.“Major Syed Moiz Abbas fought bravely in the face of resistance and ultimately laid down his life in the line of duty, upholding the highest traditions of bravery, sacrifice, and patriotism,” the ISPR statement quoted Munir as saying.His body was flown to his hometown of Chakwal in Punjab, where he was laid to rest with full military honours.A resurfaced clip of his old interview with Geo TV, now circulating on social media, shows Moiz — then a captain — detailing the events surrounding the capture of Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman.Varthaman had shot down a Pakistani F-16 fighter in February 2019 before his MiG-21 was hit and he was captured. He was held in Pakistan for three days before being released.The TTP, also known as the Pakistan Taliban, was formed in 2007 as an umbrella group of several militant outfits. Its primary aim is to impose a strict interpretation of Islamic law across Pakistan.Believed to have close ties with al-Qaeda, the TTP has been blamed for numerous deadly attacks in Pakistan, including the 2009 assault on army headquarters, attacks on military bases, and the 2008 bombing of the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad.Pakistan has described the TTP as “Fitna al-Khawarij,” referencing a historical Islamic sect known for violent rebellion.",Major Syed Moiz Abbas Shah was killed along with Lance Naik Jibran Ullah during an operation against Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) fighters.

Where are scam centers spreading?

Who are the victims?

Who are the people traffickers?





Human trafficking-fueled scam centers have significantly expanded their operations worldwide, according to a crime trend update released on Monday by the international police agency Interpol.Hubs where trafficking victims are forced to take part in online fraud first emerged in a few Southeast Asian nations, but investigators are now also uncovering similar fraud centers in other regions.According to the international police organization, victims now come from 66 countries across all continents, highlighting what Interpol describes as a "" global crisis "" involving hundreds of thousands of people.Scam centers are now increasingly found in other regions, including the Middle East, West Africa, fast emerging as a new regional hub, and Central America.Victims are often lured with fake job offers and then held captive in scam compounds. Many are blackmailed over alleged debts, beaten, sexually exploited, and in some cases tortured or raped.Inside these centers, they are forced to run online scams, mostly targeting people abroad to steal money.A 2024 Interpol-led operation exposed dozens of cases where victims were coerced into committing fraud, including a raid on an industrial-scale scam centre in the Philippines.That same year, police dismantled a centre in Namibia where 88 youths were forced to scam others.Emerging technologies are fuelling this trend further. The crime update notes a surge in the use of artificial intelligence, from generating fake job ads to creating deepfake profiles for ""sextortion"" and romance scams.Interpol says the pool of those preyed upon has widened significantly.While early human trafficking victims were mainly Chinese-speaking and came from China, Malaysia, Thailand or Singapore, people are now being trafficked to such hubs from South America, East Africa and Western Europe.""Tackling this rapidly globalizing threat requires a coordinated international response,"" said said Interpol's acting head of police services Cyril Gout.The report found that about 90 per cent of human trafficking facilitators came from Asia, while 11% were from South America or Africa.About 80 per cent of these facilitators were men, with 61 per cent aged between 20 and 39.Online scam centers were initially concentrated in Cambodia, with additional trafficking hubs later uncovered in Laos and Myanmar. Today, similar operations have been identified in at least four more Asian countries, and evidence shows the model is spreading to other regions such as West Africa, where cyber-enabled financial crime is already common.In its findings, Interpol warned that the spread of such criminal networks needs urgent, coordinated action to disrupt trafficking routes and support victims.Interpol said that these criminal hubs are increasingly intertwined with other major transnational crimes, demanding a globally coordinated response.Trafficking routes used for scam centers are being exploited for smuggling drugs, firearms, and endangered wildlife like tigers and pangolins, Interpol said.","Human trafficking-fueled scam centers have significantly expanded their operations worldwide.

Dhaka: The alleged rape of a 26-year-old minority Hindu woman in Bangladesh's Cumilla district by a ""supporter"" of former PM Khaleda Zia's BNP has sparked widespread outrage, with the High Court directing that the video of her assault, which went viral on social media, be removed immediately and she be given police protection.Fazar Ali has been arrested on the charge of rape while four others are accused of making and circulating the video, said authorities, who have also been directed to ensure medical support to the woman. HC asked them to file a report within 15 days on the progress of investigations into the Thursday night incident. The video surfaced online on Saturday night.Condemning the incident and demanding exemplary punishment, BNP secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir said there is a ""dangerous conspiracy afoot to damage BNP's reputation"". The party is yet to clarify whether Fazar was linked to it. Fakhrul claimed the woman was a Hindu expatriate's wife.Fazar, after the Sheikh Hasina-led Awami League govt's fall last year, started introducing himself as a BNP member and attending its programmes, according to sources in political parties. He's seen in photos of BNP's Ramchandrapur South Union office's inauguration on Dec 14 last year.University students, including in Dhaka, held marches in solidarity with the victim, calling for justice.While Naripokkho, a women's rights body, called on citizens to break silence and resist violence against women, human rights organisations such as Ain o-Salish Kendra and Manusher Jonno Foundation called for ""swift trial and exemplary punishment"".The woman filed a case on Friday. She said she had come with her children to visit her parents, and on Thursday night, Fazar came to her house and asked her to open the door. When she refused, he broke the door, entered the house and raped her, according to authorities.","Fazar Ali has been arrested on the charge of rape while four others are accused of making and circulating the video.

Earthquake jolts Nepal: Magnitude 4.2 earthquake strikes Nepal; susceptible to aftershocks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/earthquake-jolts-nepal-magnitude-4-2-earthquake-strikes-nepal-susceptible-to-aftershocks/articleshow/122142126.cms,"Earthquake of magnitude 4.2 strikes Nepal (ANI)





An earthquake of magnitude 4.2 on the Richter scale jolted Nepal on Sunday, according to a statement released by the National Center for Seismology (NCS).The statement noted that the earthquake is susceptible to aftershocks, as it occurred at a shallow depth of 10 km.In a post on X, the NCS said: ""EQ of M: 4.2, On: 29/06/2025 14:19:05 IST, Lat: 29.35 N, Long: 81.94 E, Depth: 10 Km, Location: Nepal.""Shallow earthquakes, such as the one that struck Nepal on Sunday, are typically more dangerous than deeper ones. In such cases, tremors are felt much closer to the Earth's surface, increasing the potential for widespread damage to life and property. In contrast, tremors from deeper earthquakes tend to lose intensity before reaching the surface.Nepal has a long history of seismic activity, with the devastating 2015 earthquake, which claimed thousands of lives, still fresh in public memory. The country lies in the Himalayan region, a zone of intense seismic activity, caused by the ongoing collision between the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates.This collision leads to the Indian plate sliding beneath the Eurasian plate, a process known as subduction, which builds up immense pressure and stress within the Earth’s crust.The subduction zone amplifies this stress, making Nepal particularly vulnerable to earthquakes.The ongoing tectonic collision also contributes to the uplift of the Himalayan mountain range, further adding to seismic activity in the region.Earlier on April 26, a minute of silence was observed in memory of the 8,969 victims who lost their lives during the deadly 2015 earthquake in Nepal. Nepali Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli stood beneath the replica of the Dharahara Tower, which collapsed during the 7.8-magnitude earthquake a decade ago, and paid tribute to those who perished in the disaster.","An earthquake of magnitude 4.2 on the Richter scale jolted Nepal on Sunday.

Boost For Saudi Airpower; Trump Says U.S. Will Sell F-35 Aircraft To Riyadh Despite Israeli Concerns





US President Donald Trump on Tuesday announced that Saudi Arabia will be designated a major non-Nato ally as he hosted Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at the White House.“Tonight, I'm pleased to announce that we're taking our military cooperation to even greater heights by formally designating Saudi Arabia as a major non-Nato ally, which is something that is very important to them,” he said. “And I'm just telling you now for the first time, because they wanted to keep a little secret for tonight,” news agency AFP quoted him saying.The move marks a significant elevation in defence ties between Washington and Riyadh and places Saudi Arabia among a select group of countries that enjoy privileged security cooperation with the United States.CBS News said the designation could pave the way for deeper joint military initiatives and greater interoperability between the two nations. It is also seen as a symbolic gesture underscoring closer strategic alignment, with US President Trump saying it would take “our military cooperation to even greater heights.”Saudi Arabia would join 20 other nations that currently hold major non-Nato ally status, including regional players such as Israel, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, Egypt, Tunisia and Jordan.This follows soon after US signed a sweeping set of agreements with Saudi Arabia covering civil nuclear cooperation, artificial intelligence and defence, including the long-anticipated sale of F-35 fighter jets on Tuesday.In a statement, the White House said both sides had signed a Joint Declaration on the Completion of Negotiations on Civil Nuclear Energy Cooperation, establishing the legal basis for a “decades-long, multi-billion-dollar partnership built on strong non-proliferation standards.” US had also approved a “major defence sale package” that includes future deliveries of advanced F-35 aircraft, despite long-standing Israeli concerns.

Boost For Saudi Airpower; Trump Says U.S. Will Sell F-35 Aircraft To Riyadh Despite Israeli Concerns





The United States on Tuesday inked a broad set of agreements with Saudi Arabia on civil nuclear co-operation and AI, and cleared a major defence package that includes the long-anticipated sale of F-35 jets, the White House said.In its statement, the White House said the two countries inked a joint declaration on the Completion of Negotiations on Civil Nuclear Energy Cooperation that establishes the legal framework for a ""decades-long, multi-billion-dollar partnership built on strong non-proliferation standards"".It added that US President Donald Trump had approved a “major defence sale package” involving future deliveries of advanced F-35 aircraft. The announcement was detailed in a factsheet published on the White House website, which also said the agreements deepen the US-Saudi strategic partnership, expand opportunities for American workers and strengthen regional security.This comes in the wake of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s visit to the United States, during which the White House said the Kingdom increased its investment commitments in the US from the $600 billion announced during Trump’s visit to Riyadh in May to nearly $1 trillion.According to the factsheet published on The White House website, the latest agreements cover a broad set of sectors. These include a Civil Nuclear Cooperation Agreement, a framework on critical minerals aimed at diversifying supply chains, and an artificial intelligence memorandum of understanding that would give Saudi Arabia access to American systems while ensuring protections for US technology. The two sides also signed a Strategic Defence Agreement described by the White House as strengthening their more than 80-year security partnership and bolstering deterrence across the Middle East.The defence package includes future F-35 jets and nearly 300 American tanks, which the White House said would support the US industrial base and create high-paying jobs.(With inputs from agencies)",The United States on Tuesday inked a broad set of agreements with Saudi Arabia on civil nuclear co-operation and AI.

Bill that could imprison people who get abortions stalls; lawmakers split — what’s in it?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/bill-that-could-imprison-people-who-get-abortions-stalls-lawmakers-split-whats-in-it/articleshow/125424745.cms,"Screen grab (Source:X/@ABC)







A controversial South Carolina proposal seeking to impose severe criminal penalties on women who undergo abortions and potentially curtail the use of IUDs and in vitro fertilisation has stalled after failing to clear a key legislative subcommittee on Tuesday.Four of the six Republican members on the panel declined to vote, allowing the three Democrats to block the bill from advancing. The measure, which would prohibit all abortions except when a woman’s life is at risk, also carried some of the toughest punitive provisions seen in the US since the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade in 2022, reported news agency AP.Republican Senator Jeff Zell, explaining why he refused to vote, said he aimed to curb abortions but believed the bill went far beyond what most residents supported. “Say what you want. Play your politics. I’m not interested in that. What I’m interested in is speaking on behalf of South Carolinians and they’re not interested in this bill right now,” he said.Lawmakers had earlier rejected attempts to soften or remove provisions that would impose up to 30 years in prison on women seeking abortions and anyone assisting them. Efforts to strike language criminalising guidance on where an abortion could be legally obtained also failed.The bill’s wording suggested a ban on contraceptives that prevent implantation of a fertilised egg, raising concerns over IUDs and possibly constraining IVF procedures. Doctors warned that even offering information about out-of-state abortion services could be deemed illegal.Senator Richard Cash, the bill’s sponsor and a vocal anti-abortion figure, insisted the criminal penalties remained necessary. He argued that overturning Roe v. Wade had forced lawmakers to confront issues long overlooked. “We never even thought about it. And now we do,” he said.Anti-abortion groups themselves remain split. South Carolina Citizens for Life said it could not back the bill, arguing women are “victims too”. Equal Protection South Carolina took the opposite stance, with founder Mark Corral declaring, “Abortion is murder and should be treated as such.”Democratic Senator Brad Hutto welcomed the bill’s stalled progress but predicted the fight would resurface. “I say, if it’s January, there’s an abortion bill,” he remarked, signalling more legislative battles when the Assembly reconvenes in 2026.Advocacy groups such as WREN said the measure is “quite literally, the most extreme piece of legislation… ever in this country,” with CEO Amalia Luxardo warning it contains no exceptions of any kind and could have sweeping consequences for reproductive care.ABC news quoted Nimra Chowdhry of the Center for Reproductive Rights who cautioned that the bill could set a template for similar legislation in other conservative states, saying restrictive proposals often “gain momentum” once they advance.South Carolina currently enforces a six-week abortion ban, enacted in May 2023, with narrow exceptions for rape and incest up to 12 weeks, certain fatal fetal anomalies and when the pregnant person’s life is at risk.","Four of the six Republican members on the panel declined to vote, allowing the three Democrats to block the bill from advancing.

Kate Middleton's appeal to business leaders





Princess Kate Middleton delivered her first public speech in two years at the Future Workforce Summit in London. The appearance marked her return to regular duties after announcing her cancer diagnosis in March 2024 and her remission earlier this year.In her remarks, the Princess of Wales concentrated on early childhood, a long-standing area of her public work. She said that a child’s earliest years have a lasting impact on adult life and described love and stable relationships as factors that contribute to resilience and wellbeing.Kate urged business leaders to balance financial goals with policies that support families and caregiving. She said companies should value “time and tenderness” alongside productivity and argued that profitability and positive social impact do not have to be at odds.She encouraged workplaces to consider how their structures and expectations affect parents and young children, particularly in the early years.The event brought together senior UK business figures involved with the Royal Foundation Business Taskforce for Early Childhood. The taskforce, launched in 2023, aims to encourage companies to invest more in early childhood initiatives and improve conditions for families.The foundation’s stated goal is to reach more than one million babies and young children by 2026.Kate delivered her speech as part of her gradual return to public engagements. Her appearance signalled a continuation of her early-years campaign following her treatment and reduced schedule over the past two years.In March 2024, Kate publicly announced that she had been diagnosed with cancer and would step back from royal duties while undergoing treatment. She completed chemotherapy later that year and confirmed her remission in early 2025. During this period, her public appearances were limited to occasional video messages, making her speech at the summit her most significant in-person engagement since her diagnosis.","Kate Middleton delivered her first public speech in two years at the Future Workforce Summit in London.

Visa Breach Ends India Visit for Blacklisted UK Scholar and Hindi Literature Expert Francesca Orsini





: PoK-origin UK home secretary Shabana Mahmood announced Monday that Trump-style visa bans will be imposed on countries unless they accept the return of their criminals and illegal immigrants, as she revealed further sweeping reforms to tackle illegal immigration.The first countries to face such a ban are Angola, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of Congo whose nationals will no longer be granted UK visas unless their govts rapidly improve cooperation on removals. “These countries face penalties for their unacceptably low co-operation and obstructive returns processes. Thousands of illegal migrants and criminals from these nations are currently in the UK,” the home office said.Non-cooperation includes embassies failing to process removals paperwork in time and requiring individuals to sign their own documentation — allowing them to block their own deportation.India is thought to be one of several other countries most resistant to taking back illegal migrants and could join the list over the coming year, the Times (UK) reported.Human rights laws will also be overhauled to scale up deportations and prevent migrants from “gaming the system”.UK’s govt will legislate to reform how Article 8 (the right to family and private life) is interpreted by the courts to make clear a family connection means immediate family, such as a parent or child — blocking people from using dubious connections to stay in the UK. It will also work with partners at the Council of Europe to address the “over-expansive application” of Article 3 (protection against inhuman and degrading treatments) which migrants are also using to block their removal and introduce new legislation to crack down on “migrants making last-minute bogus modern slavery claims”. Migrants will be restricted to arguing all legal grounds within a single appeal and, if they lose, they will be forced to leave.New capped work and study routes for genuine refugees will be created who will be referred through partners such as the UNHCR. British people will be encouraged to house them, as they have done for Ukrainians, to end the reliance on asylum hotels, which cost £2.1 billion in 2024-2025.In the year ending June 2025 a total of 5,475 Indian nationals claimed asylum in the UK making them the sixth-largest nationality. Of these, 346 Indians arrived by small boat illegally. The other Indians were mostly on visas, with student visas being the most common. The top nationality to claim asylum was Pakistani; followed by nationals from Afghanistan, Iran, Eritrea and Bangladesh.Only 20 Indians were granted asylum in the year ending June 2025, and 2,691 had their claims refused.","Angola, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of Congo will face visa bans unless they accept the return of their criminals and illegal immigrants.

‘Desperate’ For Saudi-Israel Ties, Trump 'IGNORES' Pentagon's China Threat; Okays 48 F-35 Jets Deal





US President Donald Trump said on Monday that his administration would move ahead with the long-anticipated sale of F-35 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia, despite internal concerns that the deal could expose sensitive American technology to China.When asked whether he would approve the sale, Trump said, “I will say that we will be doing that. We’ll be selling F-35s.”The announcement came a day before Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s expected arrival in Washington, his first US visit in over seven years. The F-35 deal is among several major agreements the two countries are likely to unveil during the visit, according to AP.The crown prince is expected to seek formal US assurances on military protection for the kingdom and the purchase of the F-35, one of the world’s most advanced fighter jets.The timing of the announcement also reflects Trump’s push to secure a normalisation deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel. He has promoted an expansion of the Abraham Accords as key to long-term regional stability while the fragile Gaza ceasefire holds. “I hope that Saudi Arabia will be going into the Abraham Accords very shortly,” he told reporters on Air Force One on Friday.However, Saudi Arabia has maintained that any deal must include a guaranteed pathway to a Palestinian state, a position Israel firmly rejects.Officials say Riyadh is unlikely to join the accords immediately, though there is guarded optimism about a possible agreement by the end of Trump’s second term.The New York Times reported that a Pentagon intelligence assessment raised fresh concerns that China could gain access to sensitive F-35 technology if the sale proceeds. Sources familiar with the Defence Intelligence Agency’s findings said US officials fear potential Chinese espionage and Beijing’s growing security cooperation with Riyadh. Washington has also been evaluating whether the sale would affect Israel’s qualitative military edge, given Israel is the only Middle Eastern country operating F-35s and has used them in strikes in Iran in October 2024 and June 2025.Bradley Bowman of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies said Congress may now seek clarity on what assurances Riyadh has offered regarding its ties with China. He added that lawmakers are likely to press the administration on how it plans to maintain Israel’s military advantage in the region.",US President Donald Trump said on Monday that his administration would move ahead with the long-anticipated sale of F-35 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia.

Trump 'knew about the underage girls'?











Mark Epstein, the brother of the late pedophile Jeffrey Epstein , has tried to shut down a viral rumour about the newly released Epstein emails. He said that the name “Bubba” mentioned in a 2018 exchange between the brothers was not a reference to former President Bill Clinton.The clarification came after a March 2018 email between Jeffrey and Mark Epstein was released this week by Democrats, which stirred a row. In the message, Mark asked Jeffrey, who had said he was with Steve Bannon, to “ask him if Putin has the photos of Trump b*****g Bubba.” Because Clinton was long known by the nickname “Bubba”, the reference was speculated by many as Trump having oral intercourse with Clinton.Mark Epstein pushed back in a statement to The Advocate, saying the message was being misread. “They were simply part of a humorous private exchange between two brothers and were never meant for public release or to be interpreted as serious remarks,” he wrote. He added, “For the avoidance of doubt, the reference to ‘Bubba’ in this correspondence is not, in any way, a reference to former President Bill Clinton.”Mark's spokesperson, Ali Clark, said in an email that Bubba is “a private individual who is not a public figure.”Mark said that attaching political motives to a nickname distracts from “the serious questions that remain unanswered.”The wider set of emails points to far more serious claims about Jeffrey Epstein’s political ties with the MAGA chief. In a 2019 message to author Michael Wolff, Epstein wrote that Trump “knew about the girls as he asked Ghislaine to stop.” Another email from 2011, sent to Ghislaine Maxwell, claimed that Trump spent hours at Epstein’s home with one of his sex-trafficking victims.California Representative Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, said the documents raise “serious new questions” about Trump’s ties to Epstein and accused the Justice Department of obstructing the inquiry. “There’s a massive cover-up at the White House and the DOJ right now over the files.”The White House has dismissed the emails, with press secretary Karoline Leavitt rejecting any suggestion of Trump being involved in the Epstein scandal.Meanwhile, Trump also claimed that Bill Clinton spent significant time on Epstein’s island and threatened to launch an FBI and DOJ probe into various high-profile figures, including JPMorgan and Chase.The row intensified on Friday when Trump launched a Truth Social rant attacking Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene after she backed a bipartisan move to force the release of all unclassified Epstein files.","Mark Epstein, the brother of the late pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, has tried to shut down a viral rumour about the newly released Epstein emails.

On Cam: Dem Lawmaker’s ‘Texts’ With Epstein Inside U.S. Cong Sparks Fury; Explosive Plaskett Link





Former Harvard University president and US treasury secretary Larry Summers has said he will step back from several public roles following the release of documents detailing years of personal correspondence with convicted sex offender and disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.In a statement issued by him on Monday night, quoted by The Washington Post, Summers said he was “deeply ashamed” of maintaining contact with Epstein and accepted full responsibility for what he called a “misguided” decision. He said he would continue his teaching duties but would retreat from other commitments as part of an effort to rebuild trust and mend ties with people close to him.“I am deeply ashamed of my actions and recognize the pain they have caused,” Summers said. “I take full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr. Epstein. While continuing to fulfill my teaching obligations, I will be stepping back from public commitments as one part of my broader effort to rebuild trust and repair relationships with the people closest to me”, he added.His announcement comes in the wake of the House Oversight Committee’s release of a fresh set of documents detailing Epstein’s extensive interactions with political leaders, influential figures and long-time associates.While much public attention focused on Epstein’s comments about Donald Trump, the material also shed light on his communications with Summers.According to a report by The Guardian, emails exchanged between the two from 2013 to early 2019 show Epstein and Summers discussing politics, personal matters and Summers’s own relationships. In several of the exchanges, Epstein offered advice on Summers’s attempts to pursue a woman. The final messages were sent only months before Epstein’s arrest.The Centre for American Progress said Summers was no longer a fellow and confirmed that the planned launch of an economic working group he was to help lead had been put on hold as Summers continued to remain under public scrutiny. The Yale Budget Lab said he had withdrawn from its advisory group. Other organisations with which he is affiliated, including economic think tanks, did not immediately issue public comments.Summers, who served as Harvard University president from 2001 to 2006 and continues as a professor, faced renewed calls for the university to distance itself. Senator Elizabeth Warren, herself an emerita Harvard professor, told CNN that the institution should sever ties. Harvard did not respond to requests for comment.Epstein donated more than $9 million to Harvard and its affiliated programmes between 1998 and 2008 and briefly held a visiting fellowship that the university later found he was unqualified for.Summers has previously acknowledged regretting his dealings with Epstein. The release of the latest documents has revived scrutiny over the depth and duration of their relationship.","Larry Summers has said he will step back from several public roles following the release of documents detailing years of personal correspondence with disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.

"Sheikh Hasina sentenced to death, Dhaka reiterates extradition call; India non-committal",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/death-penalty-for-hasina-dhaka-wants-her-back/articleshow/125398370.cms,"Ousted Bangladesh PM Hasina Calls ICT’s Death Sentence ‘Rigged’, Says It Denied Fair Trial Rights

.

.





Deposed Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina was Monday sentenced to death in absentia for the violent 2024 student crackdown by a special tribunal in a verdict that she described as a foregone conclusion. Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus hailed the verdict saying no one is above the law.Hasina had called the tribunal a kangaroo court and, as she told ToI before the verdict, one that was controlled by her political adversaries looking to deflect attention from their governance failures.India responded to Hasina’s sentencing with caution as it said in a statement that it had taken note of the verdict by the ""International Crimes Tribunal of Bangladesh” and, as a close neighbour, remained committed to the best interests of the people of Bangladesh, including in peace, democracy, inclusion and stability in that country.“We will always engage constructively with all stakeholders to that end,’’ said the external affairs ministry in a statement, giving nothing away on Dhaka’s renewal of its demand immediately after the sentencing for the extradition of the deposed PM who remains in India.The government has so far only acknowledged the interim government’s call for her extradition, while remaining non-committal on what it proposes to do about it.That has been its position since December last year, when Dhaka officially sought her extradition, and it’s unlikely to comply with any such request in haste now as Hasina’s dramatic death sentencing does little to change the situation on the ground as far as India is concerned.The 2013 extradition treaty with Dhaka in any case may provide immunity to Hasina from any political witch hunt. Article 6 of the treaty states that extradition can be refused if the offence for which it is requested is of a political character. While Dhaka will argue that the same article excludes murder from the list of such offences, Article 8 also states that a person may not be extradited if he can convince the requested state that the accusations against him were not made in good faith “in the interests of justice”.In short, extradition would be a complex and long-drawn-out process and, for India, entail both legal commitments and geopolitical considerations. The sentencing will likely only add another layer of complexity to Hasina’s case. As an aspiring great power, India would not like to be seen as giving up on a longtime ally who remained attuned to India’s economic and security interests, not least by keeping in check radical Islamists. Abandoning Hasina would also not just demoralise Hasina’s party Awami League, which is facing a ban from participating in the upcoming elections, but also energize radical anti-India forces.The unelected interim government has also done little to assuage India’s concerns about increasing radicalisation and safety and security of minority communities. India also knows that Dhaka’s ongoing efforts to revive the relationship with Pakistan can act as real conundrum for India soon, even as it engages the interim government by hosting the Bangladesh NSA for a security conclave this week.More than the fate of Hasina perhaps, India will be concerned about what the verdict might mean for Awami League as it seeks free, fair and inclusive polls in the country. Hasina told ToI last week that the ban came from an unelected cadre that seized power and now wanted to take its political opponents out of the game.“It was the Awami League that introduced key reforms to ensure transparency and fairness, including- the use of photo-based voter lists, see-through ballot boxes, and the establishment of an independent election commission. There is an irony that the only party which ensured free elections is now barred from participating,” she said. For India too, it’s imperative that Awami League be allowed to contest elections that are genuinely fair and inclusive.","Deposed Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina was Monday sentenced to death in absentia for the violent 2024 student crackdown.

EPSTEIN FILES: Ugly Clash In U.S. House; Mike Johnson Drops Truth Bomb On Dems | FULL





Donald Trump on Tuesday escalated his confrontations with women journalists, days after he called a Bloomberg reporter “piggy” when she questioned him about releasing files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The earlier exchange, which took place aboard Air Force One, resurfaced on social media on Tuesday and drew sharp criticism.The fresh controversy unfolded at the White House during Trump’s meeting with Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. ABC News correspondent Mary Bruce questioned Trump on potential conflicts of interest involving his family business and later asked the Saudi leader about the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Trump interrupted her, saying: “ABC fake news. One of the worst in the business.”Trump insisted he had “nothing to do” with the Trump Organization, now run by his two eldest sons. He also backed the crown prince’s denial of involvement in Khashoggi’s killing. “You don’t have to embarrass our guest by asking a question like that,” he told Bruce.Tensions rose further when Bruce raised the issue of Epstein after Congress voted overwhelmingly to release files linked to the disgraced financier, who died in 2019.Trump retorted: “It’s not the question that I mind. It’s your attitude. I think you are a terrible reporter.” He added he had “nothing to do” with Epstein and called the scandal a “hoax”, before telling her, “your crappy company is one of the perpetrators. ” He concluded the exchange by saying: “No more questions from you.” Trump also urged the US broadcast regulator to “look at” revoking ABC’s licence.The White House clash came to light just hours after the resurfaced Air Force One footage showed Bloomberg’s Catherine Lucey asking Trump why he would not release Epstein-related files “if there's nothing incriminating in the files.” Trump pointed at her and replied: “Quiet. Quiet, piggy.” CNN anchor Jake Tapper called the remark “disgusting and completely unacceptable.”The back-to-back incidents have renewed criticism of Trump’s treatment of journalists, especially women, as he faces renewed scrutiny over transparency and accountability.","Donald Trump escalated his confrontations with women journalists.

Major Green Card change proposed: No permanent residency if immigrants likely to become dependent on govt benefits,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/major-green-card-change-proposed-no-permanent-residency-if-immigrants-likely-to-become-dependent-on-govt-benefits/articleshow/125421334.cms,"Trump administration is proposing a major change to green card qualification.



Biometric Crackdown: Green Card Holders Face New Rules as US Tightens Immigration Security

What is public charge ?





The Donald Trump administration has been working to shake up an immigration policy that could deny lawful immigrants their desired green card if the immigration officials decide that they are going to become dependent on the state. The Department of Homeland Security has moved to change the public charge rule which has been in place since December 2022.DHS plans to expand the public charge policy that would lower the threshold for being deemed likely to depend on the government. According to reports, the rule will formally be proposed on November 19 and will be open for public feedback for 30 days.Public charge is the factors that make one immigrant dependent on the government. It is a ground of inadmissibility. The Immigration and Nationality Act does not define “public charge” but requires a totality test of certain factors to determine if a foreign national is likely to become a public charge of the government. If deemed likely, the government can deny the immigration benefit or status sought by the foreign national.Currently, the public charge factors are age, health, family status, assets, resources, and financial status; education and skills and factors defined in regulations or policy (currently, the foreign national’s receipt of certain public benefits, and in some cases, a Form I-864 Affidavit of Support).If this is expanded, the chances of getting rejected for a green card will also increase. For example, under the proposed approach, DHS officers would be required to weigh the ""totality of the circumstances,"" including family health history and economic background, with fewer specific guidelines.The proposed changes are motivated by what the Trump administration believes -- that government benefits should not encourage immigration.The change would ffectively hand more powers to Citizenship and Immigration Services officers to decide who they believe could become a ""public charge,"" according to Politico.","DHS plans to expand the public charge policy that would lower the threshold for being deemed likely to depend on the government.

President Donald Trump's economic advisor Kevin Hassett predicted a 'quiet time' in the labor market and said companies won't have to hire ""the new kids out of college"" as firms are largely depending on AIs. Social media users pointed out that the population whom he called new kids are reeling under frustration because they are unemployed.“There could be a little bit of, almost, quiet time in the labor market, because firms are finding that AI is making their workers so productive that they don’t necessarily have to hire the new kids out of college and so on,"" Hassett said, assuring that AI-induced softness in the market would be temporary.The comment came amid a fresh MAGA civil war over H-1B, the visa program that allows US tech companies to hire skilled foreigners.

Federal investigation and charges

Outcome, sentencing and exoneration

Implications for space law and public perception





A long-running and highly publicised legal saga once promoted as the world’s first “space crime” has reached a definitive conclusion after Summer Heather Worden, the estranged partner of NASA astronaut Anne McClain, pleaded guilty to making false statements to federal investigators. Worden admitted fabricating claims that McClain accessed her bank account from the International Space Station in 2019, an allegation that dominated global headlines and overshadowed McClain’s career for years.The allegations emerged in 2019 during a bitter separation between the couple. Worden accused McClain of identity theft, saying the astronaut accessed her personal bank account while on a mission aboard the ISS. As investigations began, the claim was widely reported as the first crime ever allegedly committed from space, generating intense public curiosity and media coverage.Federal authorities soon uncovered contradictions in Worden’s account. Investigators established that McClain had been granted access to the bank account years earlier as part of the couple’s shared financial arrangements. There was no evidence of wrongdoing, misuse or unauthorised access.Instead, Worden was found to have lied about when the account was opened and when she changed the login credentials.Worden’s allegations triggered inquiries by the Federal Trade Commission and NASA’s Office of Inspector General. As evidence accumulated, the narrative shifted. In an indictment unsealed in 2020, prosecutors charged Worden with two counts of making false statements to federal investigators after determining that key details in her accusations had been intentionally fabricated.In November 2025, Worden pleaded guilty in federal court, formally admitting to providing false information. The plea brought an end to more than six years of speculation, scrutiny and international reporting.With the guilty plea now entered, Worden faces a potential sentence of up to five years in federal prison and a fine of up to 250,000 dollars. Her sentencing hearing is scheduled for February 2026.For Anne McClain, the resolution marks the end of a lengthy ordeal. McClain, a decorated Army aviator and NASA astronaut, consistently denied any wrongdoing and maintained that she had legitimate access to the account.She has since continued her distinguished career, including commanding NASA’s SpaceX Crew-10 mission to the ISS in 2025.Although grounded in a personal dispute, the case had broader implications. The high-profile allegation prompted widespread discussion about legal jurisdiction in space and the regulatory frameworks that govern astronaut conduct beyond Earth. Ultimately, the investigation underscored the importance of thorough verification before drawing conclusions in cases involving new technological frontiers.","Summer Heather Worden, the estranged partner of NASA astronaut Anne McClain, pleaded guilty to making false statements to federal investigators.

Boost For Saudi Airpower; Trump Says U.S. Will Sell F-35 Aircraft To Riyadh Despite Israeli Concerns





Green energy may be out of favor in the United States but green flags are back in red-blooded America. MAGA Supremo Donald Trump rolled out the red carpet for Saudi Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) on Tuesday, rehabilitating a leader long shunned over the 2018 murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi and recasting US relations in the region amid Washington's increasingly rickety ties with India.A ceremonial welcome on the White House South Lawn festooned with green Saudi flags alongside stars and stripes, a military flyover, and a black-tie dinner later in the evening marked MBS’ return to the US capital after a seven year hiatus, signaling not just a diplomatic thaw but a full-scale strategic reset, elevating Riyadh to the center of the administration’s economic and geopolitical agenda.The visit comes weeks after Trump effected a similar, if less ostentatious and quieter recalibration with Pakistan, which signed a Strategic Mutual Defense Agreement (SMDA) involving nuclear protection with the Saudis two months ago, with no pushback from Washington, and perhaps with its blessings.At the heart of the MBS visit, coming in the midst of a furor in the capital over the Epstein files, is a raft of business deals securing billions in arms sales, accelerating civil nuclear cooperation, and solidifying Saudi Arabia’s $600-billion U.S. investment pledge. White House officials framed the visit as a moment to lock in F-35 fighter jet sales, expand artificial-intelligence partnerships, and deepen defense integration — priorities Trump says bolster America’s economic revival.It was also an unmistakable show of personal diplomacy, reflecting the Trump family’s long-standing ties to the Saudi leadership.But the spectacle could not fully eclipse the shadow of Khashoggi murder in Istanbul in 2018, which U.S. intelligence concluded MBS approved. Human rights groups, liberal lawmakers, and major media outlets condemned the warm reception as a moral retreat, with critics excoriating the administration for normalizing a leader accused of grave abuses. Trump brushed off the moral brigade, calling Saudi Arabia an “indispensable partner” against Iran and “a crucial market” he would be “a fool” to disregard.The visit also spotlights deeper regional resets and recalibrations in a region where renewed U.S.–Saudi axis intersects with Pakistan and India in complicated ways.For decades, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan have shared deep military and financial ties. Trump’s outreach to both countries — coupled with MBS’s expanded investment in Pakistan and Pakistan's rehabilitation in Washington — has fueled perceptions of a U.S. tilt that sidelines India, despite New Delhi’s centrality to the Quad and U.S. Indo-Pacific strategy. Tariff tensions with India have exacerbated the rift, despite the imminence of a trade deal and a much talked-up personal relationship between Trump and Modi. India in turn is recalibrating ties with China and moving closer to Israel.In recent years, India has also developed close ties with Riyadh although that has been undercut by the Saudi-Pak mutual defense pact. In fact, ahead of the MBS visit to Washington, New Delhi announced a major energy shift, securing a landmark deal to buy 2.2 million tonnes of U.S. liquefied petroleum gas. The agreement, representing about 10% of India’s annual LPG imports, is a significant pivot away from Gulf suppliers, including Saudi Arabia.Eventually, MBS’s visit reflects a world where every country is jostling to advance its interests in transactional ways, with human rights concerns and democratic values taking a back seat.","Donald Trump rolled out the red carpet for Saudi Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) on Tuesday, rehabilitating a leader long shunned over the 2018 murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi.

A judiciary under reconstruction



Munir’s expanding power base



(With inputs from agencies)





Pakistan’s judiciary is in a moment of crisis as senior judges resign amid a contentious constitutional amendment reshapes the balance of power in favour of the military. Behind the crisis is the contentious 27th Constitutional Amendment, a sweeping package pushed through parliament within days. Lawyers, judges and opposition parties argue that it has weakened the courts and elevated the military’s top commander to a position with no modern parallel.Since then, Pakistan’s judiciary has been hit by a series of high-profile resignations. On Saturday, Lahore High Court judge Shams Mehmood Mirza stepped down, and his family said his decision was directly linked to the 27th Amendment. His departure followed those of Supreme Court justices Mansoor Ali Shah and Athar Minallah, who issued sharply worded letters condemning the amendment as a direct attack on judicial independence.The creation of a new Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) lies at the heart of judicial restructuring. The FCC now holds exclusive jurisdiction over constitutional matters, stripping the Supreme Court of its original powers. Pending petitions have already been shifted to the new court. President Zardari swore in Justice Aminuddin Khan as its first chief justice; six other judges were appointed, including serving Supreme Court and high court judges, though one judge reportedly refused to join.The FCC’s establishment has sparked intense concern. Critics say the president’s new power to transfer judges risks becoming a tool to sideline dissenting voices. Opposition groups argue this will fundamentally weaken judicial independence and concentrate constitutional authority in the executive and military leadership.Government ministers, however, hailed the package as “historic” and a step toward greater efficiency and national unity. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said the amendment proved that “solidarity” prevailed during a time of national strain.With judges resigning, courts being reconfigured, and the military gaining unprecedented constitutional control, Pakistan faces a moment of reckoning.The amendment passed with overwhelming numbers in both houses has dramatically restructured Pakistan’s defence architecture, elevating army chief Asim Munir to Chief of Defence Forces with command over all three military branches. His five-year tenure now resets from the date of notification, enabling him to remain in office until 2030.The Senate has since rushed through four related bills, including amendments to the Army, Air Force and Navy Acts, along with changes to Supreme Court practice rules. These laws remove the earlier equality among service chiefs and replace references to the Joint Chiefs of Staff system with a new “National Strategic Command”, further centralising military authority under Munir.Dawn reported that appointments, extensions, and tenures under these reforms “shall not be called into question before any court on any ground whatsoever”.Experts quoted in multiple reports warn that the shift risks internal military tensions and further erodes civilian oversight. Lawyer Osama Malik described the reforms as something “usually granted in absolute monarchies”, arguing they grant lifetime protections not only to Munir but also to President Zardari.Opposition lawmakers responded with uproar, shredding copies of the bill and walking out. PTI leaders labelled the move “deeply undemocratic” and “the final nail in the coffin of an independent judiciary”. Critics say these changes could reshape the political landscape, particularly for nearly 200 cases involving former prime minister Imran Khan.","Pakistan's judiciary is in a moment of crisis as senior judges resign amid a contentious constitutional amendment.

What next







Pakistan’s National Assembly on Wednesday passed the 27th constitutional amendment bill, granting sweeping powers to the military in general and country’s army chief Asim Munir in specific, and restructuring the judiciary.The vote, held amid a ruckus in the lower house, saw 234 lawmakers in favour and only four against, speaker Ayaz Sadiq announced. The session was attended by top political leaders, including Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, PML-N President Nawaz Sharif, and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari.The amendment comes at a time of heightened political tension in Pakistan, with the ruling coalition seeking to consolidate control over key defence and judicial institutions. The legislation follows earlier Senate approval, where it received 64 votes in favour and no opposition, as the opposition benches boycotted proceedings.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif hailed the passage as a demonstration of national unity, saying the house exhibited solidarity. He also condemned a recent terrorist incident in Wana, drawing parallels to the Army Public School massacre, and praised law enforcement for securing the safety of students and cadets.The amendment elevates Pakistan army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir to the newly created role of Chief of Defence Forces, giving him constitutional authority over all three branches: army, navy, and air force. Honorary five-star ranks such as field marshal, marshal of the air force, and admiral of the fleet remain lifetime titles. According to the country's law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, the reform “aims to bring constitutional oversight to defence appointments while preserving military honour and tradition.The bill also establishes a federal constitutional court (FCC) to handle constitutional and provincial matters, leaving the Supreme Court to focus on civil and criminal cases. The FCC will have equal representation from all provinces and the power to take suo motu notices on constitutional petitions. The Judicial Commission will oversee judge transfers; refusal of a transfer will be treated as retirement.The ruling coalition, including PML-N, PPP, MQM-P, and allies, backed the amendment. Opposition lawmakers condemned it as unconstitutional. PTI chairman Gohar Ali Khan called it the “Baku Amendments” and accused the government of undermining democracy.

Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Powers Set To Grow As Shehbaz Govt Mulls 27th Constitution Amendment

Why it matters

The big picture

The Field Marshal’s expanding power evokes a hybrid of Pakistan’s two most dominant military rulers:

Ayub Khan, who introduced centralized presidential control and laid the foundations for military-led governance.

Zia-ul-Haq, who used the Army and Islamization to seize power, marginalize the judiciary, and suppress civilian opposition.

Munir is consolidating power not through martial law, but via constitutional amendments passed by a pliant parliament.

If Zia’s coup was loud and brutal against a strong popular leadership, Munir’s is silent, yet possibly more far reaching, being done through a political front office that’s pliant and dependent on the Army for authority. With Imran Khan in prison, any opposition will come from the streets and the troubled insurgencies to the west of Islamabad.

The transformation follows the India-Pakistan conflict in May 2025, a four-day exchange of air and missile strikes after the Pahalgam terror attack.

India’s Operation Sindoor targeted Pakistani airbases, radars, and command centers.

Pakistan requested a ceasefire after intense damage - a request reportedly initiated by Pakistan’s DGMO.

Donald Trump, who claimed to have brokered the truce(India has repeatedly denied the US President's claims), was effusively thanked by Munir and PM Shehbaz Sharif. Trump now calls Munir his “favorite field marshal.”

The Financial Times described their dynamic as a “bromance,” with Trump showcased on billboards across Pakistan alongside Munir and Sharif.

This international validation was followed by Munir’s promotion to Field Marshal, the second such promotion in Pakistan’s history - and the first codified under the Constitution.

Between the lines

This isn’t just about military command - it’s about rewriting the DNA of the Pakistani state.

The amendment creates a new Federal Constitutional Court, potentially diluting the powers of the Supreme Court and creating ambiguity about the hierarchy of judicial authority.

President Zardari is also granted lifelong immunity in the amendment, mirroring the legal shield given to Munir.

This dual protection signals a strategic alliance between the military and top civilian figures to institutionalize mutual insulation from accountability.

“Too much has been left to ad hoc and arbitrary decisions,” Mazari warned.

The domestic question: Can repression deliver reform?

The three-front storm: Taliban, TTP, and India

“If you nurture snakes in your backyard, they will bite you,” said Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, the Pakistani military’s official spokesman, referencing the Taliban. What a comeuppance : The remark could just as well apply to all Pakistan-grown terror groups and the TTP, whose resurgence is a grim case of blowback.

The bottom line





In Pakistan, where generals have often ruled with impunity and influence, Field Marshal Asim Munir is scripting a new playbook-quiet, precise, and constitutionally sealed. His rise is not just another chapter in the country’s well-worn saga of military dominance. It is, as one senior opposition leader put it, “a rewrite of the entire power manual.”Pakistan’s controversial 27th Constitutional Amendment proposes to recast the country’s military command structure by abolishing the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC) and creating the role of Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) - a position that will be held by the Army Chief, currently Field Marshal Asim Munir •The amendment vests unprecedented legal and constitutional power in the CDF, giving Munir operational and institutional control over the army, navy, and air force, as well as the country’s nuclear command.•It also grants five-star officers life-long rank, privileges, and immunity, a move seen as creating a parallel unelected authority beyond the reach of civilian or judicial oversight.“This amendment appears tailored to benefit a specific individual rather than to strengthen the defence structure,” Lt Gen Asif Yasin Malik, former defence secretary, told Dawn.The CJCSC post - created after the 1971 war to ensure coordination among services - will be dissolved on November 27, 2025, when the current chairman, Gen Sahir Shamshad Mirza, retires.The 27th Amendment represents the largest shift in Pakistan’s civil-military balance since the Zia era, codifying the military’s supremacy in a way that future civilian governments may struggle to reverse.•The military will no longer merely influence governance from behind the scenes - it will be constitutionally entrenched at the center of executive authority.•Strategic nuclear assets, previously overseen by the National Command Authority, will now fall under the commander of national strategic command, appointed by the PM on the army chief’s advice, and selected from within the army.“All nuclear weapons and delivery systems will be under army control, including second-strike missiles traditionally under the Navy,” warned Dr Shireen Mazari, former human rights minister, a Dawn report said.•The change grants the army a monopoly over promotions, transfers, and postings across the services, threatening morale and inter-service harmony.“If promotions in the Air Force and Navy are determined by an army-origin CDF, it could lead to festering resentments,” Mazari cautioned.At home, Munir is both omnipresent and embattled. According to a Financial Times report, his supporters compare him to Mohammed bin Salman or South Korea’s General Park - ruthless modernisers willing to bulldoze institutions in the name of reform. His critics, however, see echoes of Zia-ul-Haq’s theocratic militarism cloaked in constitutional legitimacy.The judiciary is already split, thanks to a proposed constitutional court that would dilute the Supreme Court’s power. Journalists are censored, civil rights groups are muzzled, and political opponents - most notably former Prime Minister Imran Khan - are jailed or silenced.And yet, Munir has cast himself as the architect of reform. In his speech at the Pakistan Military Academy, he spoke of “treasures hidden beneath our land” and claimed that Pakistan had begun to “regain its rightful place in the comity of nations.”But the economy tells another story. As per the FT report, Pakistan’s investment rate is the lowest in South Asia, its poverty rate has risen to 25%, and its youth unemployment is dangerously high. The country remains dependent on IMF bailouts and Gulf financing that has yet to materialise in promised volumes.While Munir consolidates power at home, Pakistan finds itself encircled by a resurgent triangle of threats - each historically rooted, each dangerously revived. In the west, the Afghan Taliban’s return to power in 2021 has proved more liability than leverage. Once covertly supported by Pakistan’s security establishment, the Taliban now resist Islamabad’s demands and turn a blind eye to cross-border attacks on Pakistani soil.More ominously, the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), an offshoot long declared outlawed, has regrouped in Afghanistan and resumed attacks in Pakistan’s tribal belt and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. This year alone, militant violence has killed over 1,400 people - the highest toll in a decade.“The military simply lacks political support on the ground there,” Iftikhar Firdous, founder of The Khorasan Diary, told FT. “The crackdown has alienated entire communities.”Simultaneously, Pakistan’s eastern border with India remains fragile after the four-day air conflict in May.Add to that domestic insurgencies in Balochistan and the Pashtun belt, and Pakistan now faces not one, but three overlapping security fronts. Instead of acting as a force-multiplier, the military’s expanding political and economic footprint is beginning to stretch its operational capacity thin.The 27th Amendment enshrines military supremacy in Pakistan's Constitution under the guise of reform and modernization.•It moves the country further away from parliamentary democracy, and deeper into military-led constitutional authoritarianism.•As Field Marshal Asim Munir prepares to become the first Chief of Defence Forces, Pakistan’s most consequential question remains: Can a military man fix a failing nation - or will history repeat itself?(With inputs from agencies)","Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Powers Set To Grow As Shehbaz Govt Mulls 27th Constitution Amendment.

ISLAMABAD: A suicide bomber killed 12 people outside a court in Islamabad on Tuesday in a sharp escalation of militant violence that the defence minister said had pushed the country into a ""state of war"".Pakistani govt ministers accused neighbouring Afghanistan of complicity in the bloodshed - an accusation Kabul denied - and vowed retaliation if Afghan authorities failed to rein in the militants Islamabad says were responsible. ""We are in a state of war,"" said defence minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif after the attack, the first strike on civilians in Islamabad in a decade. ""Bringing this war to Islamabad is a message from Kabul, to which Pakistan has the full power to respond. ""The bombing outside an Islamabad court also wounded 27 people interior minister Mohsin Naqvi said. The court bomber blew himself up near the entrance at around lunchtime. Images on local media showed people covered in blood lying next to a police van. A vehicle was seen on fire and another car was badly damaged. Police cordoned off the site. Naqvi said the bomber had tried to enter the court building on foot but, unable to find a way in, detonated the device outside, close to a police vehicle.Several of the wounded were in critical condition, a hospital source said.No group claimed responsibility for Tuesday's attack. The main Pakistani militant group, Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), denied involvement in the attacks. But a group affiliated with the Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, according to The Khorasan Diary, a digital platform in Islamabad that monitors militant activity in the region.TTP militants have in recent years focused attacks on security forces. Civilians had not been hit in Islamabad for a decade, according to Armed Conflict Location and Event Data, a group that tracks attacks.Islamabad says that the Pakistani Taliban and other militants are based in Afghanistan, with the support of India. ""We are totally clear that Afghanistan has to stop them. In case of a failure, we have no option but to take care of those terrorists who are attacking our country,"" Naqvi said, speaking at the scene of the court bombing. The Taliban administration spokesperson in Kabul did not respond to a request for comment on Pakistan's accusations.The court attack happened hours after militants stormed a school near the Afghan border on Monday. The attack on the school in Wana, in the north west, began Monday, when a suicide vehicle rammed the main entrance, killing three people, Naqvi said. Militants then entered the school, which is run by the military but educates civilians.By Tuesday evening, three militants were still inside the compound, security officials said, with rescue operations under way for the students trapped in another part of the school. Naqvi said that the school assailants were in contact with their handlers in Afghanistan during the attack.Reuters","A suicide bomber killed 12 people outside a court in Islamabad on Tuesday in a sharp escalation of militant violence.

Attack outside court complex



Surge in militant violence and worsening ties with Afghanistan







Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif said the country was “in a state of war” after a suicide bomber struck outside the Islamabad district courts on Tuesday, killing at least 12 people and injuring 27.The blast one of the deadliest to hit the capital in recent years has intensified tensions with Afghanistan, with Asif accusing the Taliban government in Kabul of allowing militants to operate freely.In a post on X, Asif said: “Anyone who thinks that the Pakistan army is fighting this war in the Afghan-Pakistan border region and the remote areas of Balochistan should take today’s suicide attack at the Islamabad district courts as a wake-up call: This is a war for all of Pakistan.”He wrote that Pakistan’s military was making “daily sacrifices while providing citizens with a sense of protection and security”, but warned that hoping for negotiations with Kabul would be a “mistake”. Asif insisted that Afghanistan “has the ability to prevent terrorist attacks inside Pakistan” and that bringing the conflict to the capital was “a message from Kabul”.He added that Pakistan “has the strength to respond fully”, saying the attack had erased any remaining doubts about the threat posed by militants operating from Afghan soil.The explosion took place around midday in Islamabad’s G-11 district, just outside the judicial complex where hundreds of lawyers and visitors were present. Police said the attacker tried to enter the court premises but failed, eventually detonating explosives next to a police vehicle, igniting cars and sending a fireball through the street.Interior minister Mohsin Naqvi confirmed that 12 people were killed and 27 wounded. He said authorities had recovered a severed head believed to be that of the attacker, and CCTV footage captured him moments before the blast. Witnesses described scenes of chaos, with people screaming for help as ambulances rushed to the site.The blast comes amid a sharp rise in militant violence across Pakistan. Security officials say the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) has carried out hundreds of attacks this year, mostly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa near the Afghan border, but strikes in major cities have been rare. Islamabad was last hit by a suicide attack three years ago.On Monday night, militants also attempted to storm an army-run college in Wana, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Security forces killed two attackers quickly, while others were cornered inside an administrative building. Students and staff were evacuated, and the military said the assault resembled the TTP’s 2014 massacre in Peshawar that killed 154 people.Pakistan says the Afghan Taliban have allowed TTP fighters to take refuge across the border.

Deadlock Deepens: Afghanistan Calls Pakistan Irresponsible As Peace Talks Break Down Once Again





ISLAMABAD: Pakistan said on Sunday that it was committed to dialogue to resolve differences with the Afghan Taliban but demanded that Kabul must address concerns regarding the use of its territory by terrorists.Foreign Office (FO) spokesperson Tahir Andrabi issued a statement on different media queries regarding the third round of talks with the Afghan Taliban regime in Istanbul on November 6, which concluded a day later. Turkiye and Qatar mediated the parleys.The peace talks ended without any agreement to tackle the thorny issues of cross-border terrorism , the top officials had said on Saturday.""Pakistan remains committed to the resolution of bilateral differences through dialogue. However, Pakistan's core concern, i.e. terrorism emanating from Afghanistan, needs to be addressed first and foremost,"" the FO said in a statement.It also said that Pakistan's Armed Forces and its people were well determined to eliminate the menace of terrorism from its soil and take action against its supporters, abettors and financiers.In the long statement, the spokesperson said that for the past four years, since the Taliban regime came to power in Afghanistan, there has been a sharp surge in terrorist attacks emanating from Afghan soil.""Throughout these years, Pakistan, despite suffering military and civilian casualties, exercised maximum restraint and did not retaliate,"" it said.Pakistan's expectation was that the Taliban regime would be able to control these attacks and take concrete actions against the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan/Fitna al Khawarij (TTP/FaK) elements present on Afghan soil, the FO said.The Pakistan government last year notified the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) as ""Fitna al-Khawarij"", a reference to a group in earlier Islamic history which was involved in violence.Pakistan also tried to positively engage with Afghanistan by offering bilateral trade concessions and humanitarian assistance, and the intention to constructively engage with Afghanistan so as to enable it to become a stable, peaceful and prosperous country that is at peace within and with its neighbours, the statement said.However, despite all these positive gestures, ""the response from the Taliban regime has only been hollow promises and inaction,"" it added.Instead of acting upon the core expectation to stop Afghan territory from being used for attacks against Pakistan, the Taliban regime has always tried to shy away from taking concrete and verifiable actions, it said.""Instead, it has tried to confuse the main issue with other relatively irrelevant and hypothetical issues. By confusing the main issue of terrorism, it keeps trying to develop a narrative which absolves the Taliban regime of its commitments and responsibilities towards the international community and its own people,"" it added.The statement said that Pakistan's October 2025 response to the consistent attacks emanating from Afghanistan was a manifestation of the will and determination that it will not leave any stone unturned to safeguard its territory and its people.The statement added that the Taliban regime was only interested in prolonging the temporary ceasefire, but without taking concrete and verifiable actions against the TTP/FaK terrorists.Pakistan also accused the Afghan Taliban of using the issue of Pakistani terrorists hiding in Afghanistan as a humanitarian issue, adding that they had fled in 2015 to avoid a military operation and fought together with the Afghan Taliban against Nato troops.""These terrorists and their families are now being harboured by the Taliban regime as a payback for their allegiance to the Afghan Taliban,"" it said, and added that the same terrorists established training camps in Afghanistan to launch terrorist activities in Pakistan.The FO rejected the Kabul excuse of lack of control over TTP and demanded definite and concrete actions.

Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Powers Set To Grow As Shehbaz Govt Mulls 27th Constitution Amendment

What does it mean?



Opposition backlash and protests



Divided legal opinions



Support for reforms







Pakistan’s government has introduced a major constitutional change that has sparked widespread debate and protests across the country. The proposed 27th constitutional amendment, which will be voted on in Parliament next week, seeks to restructure the military’s chain of command and overhaul the judiciary, prompting strong criticism from the Opposition.The current move mirrors the era of General Zia-ul-Haq, Pakistan’s longest-serving de facto head of state, who introduced sweeping constitutional changes to entrench military control under a civilian façade. The proposed 27th Amendment, risks reviving that legacy by placing the armed forces once again at the centre of Pakistan’s political structure.The bill, tabled in the Senate on Saturday after cabinet approval, proposes to abolish the post of chairman joint chiefs of staff committee (CJCSC) and replace it with a new and more powerful position -- chief of defence forces (CDF).According to reports in Dawn, the post will be held by the serving chief of army staff, who will also become the constitutional head of the army, navy and air force. This change would make General Asim Munir the most powerful military officer in Pakistan’s history, formalising his recent promotion to Field Marshal.The amendment also includes plans to set up a new federal constitutional court (FCC) and change how high court judges are appointed.It seeks to transfer some powers from the Supreme Court to the new court, while also granting the president lifelong immunity from criminal prosecution.Pakistan law minister Azam Nazir Tarar presented the bill in the senate, where chairman Yusuf Raza Gilani referred it to a committee led by Farooq Naek for review. Naek said the goal was to “create consensus among members” before the bill comes up for voting on Monday. The government is confident of securing a two-thirds majority in both the senate and the national assembly.Opposition parties have strongly opposed the amendment, calling it a direct threat to Pakistan’s Constitution. A coalition of opposition groups, the Tehreek-e-Tahafuz Ayeen-e-Pakistan (TTAP), which includes Imran Khan’s PTI, Majlis Wahdat-e-Muslimeen (MWM), Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP), Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) and the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) has announced nationwide protests starting Sunday.“Democratic institutions have been paralysed within Pakistan… the nation must step up against the [proposed] 27th Amendment,” MWM chief Allama Raja Nasir Abbas said.PkMAP leader Mahmood Khan Achakzai said the protests would begin with the slogan: “Long live democracy, down with dictatorship.” He warned, “The opposition alliance had no choice but to launch a protest movement following the government’s move, which is shaking the foundations of the Constitution.”Legal experts are split on the amendment’s impact. Critics say it would reduce the powers of the Supreme Court, making it “irrelevant,” and tighten executive control over the judiciary.One senior counsel told Dawn, “Left with a limited jurisdiction of deciding ordinary civil, criminal and statutory appeals, the Supreme Court has now become all the more a ‘Supreme District Court’.”Former additional attorney general Tariq Mehmood Khokhar warned that the changes would “empower [the new] Federal Constitutional Court by disempowering the Supreme Court.” He said the amendment also gives the Chief of the Defence Forces constitutional authority for life, formally recognising the Field Marshal rank.Another lawyer pointed out that under the new Article 175A, the chief justice of the FCC would outrank the chief justice of the Supreme Court of Pakistan and serve until the age of 68 -- three years longer than the current limit of 65.Some legal experts, however, have welcomed the changes. Senior counsel Hafiz Ahsaan Ahmad Khokhar called the 27th Amendment “a major and long-awaited structural shift” in Pakistan’s justice system.He said the plan to have two separate apex courts -- one for appeals (Supreme Court) and one for constitutional cases (FCC) -- would bring “greater clarity, efficiency and constitutional coherence.”He also argued that the reforms could reduce political influence in the judiciary, cut down case backlogs, and modernise the justice system.Khokhar added that the new defence structure under Article 243 was in line with “modern constitutional democracies,” ensuring that the armed forces would operate under a single advisory framework accountable to the prime minister, defence minister and National Security Committee.Newly elected Supreme Court Bar Association in Pakistan, President Haroonur Rasheed also supported the creation of a Federal Constitutional Court, saying it could help streamline the judicial process.","Proposed 27th constitutional amendment will be voted on in Parliament next week.

In September, an explosion on the track in Mastung derailed six coaches, leaving 12 injured.

In August, six coaches derailed after an improvised explosive device went off in Mastung, while days earlier a pilot engine came under gunfire.

In July and June, two separate blasts in Sindh derailed multiple coaches.

Late last year, a suicide bomber at Quetta Station killed at least 26 people.

Pakistan Railways has halted all operations of the Jaffar Express between Quetta and Peshawar for four days beginning Sunday, citing “serious security concerns” in Balochistan, news agency PTI reported.The temporary suspension — enforced from 9 to 12 November — follows multiple insurgent attacks on the train over the past year, including a dramatic hijacking in March that left 26 people dead.Railway officials said the move came after fresh intelligence warnings of possible attacks targeting tracks, railway assets and civilian passengers. “The precautionary measure is based on advice from security and intelligence agencies to ensure the safety of passengers, railway staff, civilians and critical rail assets,” a senior official said, as quoted by PTI.The Jaffar Express is one of Pakistan’s busiest long-distance routes, carrying thousands of passengers daily at a cost far lower than road travel. Local commuters have criticised the shutdown, saying it leaves people in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with few affordable transport options.Over the past 12 months, the Jaffar Express has become a repeated target for insurgent groups, particularly the banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA).In March, BLA militants hijacked the train with 380 passengers on board, triggering a two-day standoff in a mountainous tunnel. Twenty-six people were killed before security forces rescued more than 350 passengers. Authorities said 33 militants also died in the rescue operation.Security officials say insurgent groups are increasingly targeting railways to cripple movement and signal the state’s inability to secure critical transport arteries. Analysts note that the frequency of attacks shows “a collapse of basic security control” across parts of Balochistan’s rail corridor.Political leaders in the province argue that Islamabad has ignored decades of local grievances. Balochistan National Party chief Akhtar Mengal recently warned that the state has “lost control” of the region, saying: “There is not a single inch of Balochistan left where the government can claim authority.”The suspension comes as Pakistan faces one of its most dangerous security challenges in years. Not only has the BLA intensified operations across Balochistan, but attacks linked to Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Islamic State Khorasan (ISK) and cross-border militants have surged.According to the latest Global Terrorism Index, Pakistan recorded a 45% jump in terrorism-related deaths this year. Security officials warn the country is now battling “four fronts at once”—an insurgent network straddling provincial, sectarian and cross-border lines.Diplomatic efforts have yielded little. Peace talks this week between Pakistan and Afghanistan in Istanbul collapsed without agreement, with both sides blaming each other for breakdowns in the ceasefire. Pakistan accuses Kabul of sheltering TTP fighters; the Taliban dismisses the allegations.","Pakistan Railways has halted all operations of the Jaffar Express between Quetta and Peshawar for four days beginning Sunday.

Pakistan’s government has moved ahead with one of the most sweeping structural changes to the country’s constitutional and military setup in decades. The proposed 27th Constitutional Amendment, tabled in the Senate on Saturday after approval by the federal cabinet, rewrites the chain of command of the armed forces and places Field Marshall Asim Munir higher than any military officer before him.The bill restructures Article 243 of the Constitution and creates a powerful new post: Chief of Defence Forces (CDF). According to Dawn, the position will be held by the serving Chief of Army Staff, who will simultaneously become the constitutionally recognised head of Pakistan’s Army, Navy and Air Force. The development formalises General Munir’s elevation as Pakistan’s Field Marshal — a title that the government has already awarded but is now seeking to permanently embed into the Constitution.The changes have ignited intense debate in Islamabad, dividing political parties, lawyers and civil society. Supporters argue that the bill modernises command structures, while critics see it as a dramatic centralisation of military power that weakens civilian oversight.As per report from Dawn, the bill abolishes the position of Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC), the top coordinating office among Pakistan’s military services, from 27 November, when the tenure of the current CJCSC General Sahir Shamshad Mirza ends.Law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar told Parliament that no new appointment will be made, because the Army Chief will take over the role’s functions as Chief of Defence Forces.Under the amendment, the President will appoint the Army, Naval and Air Chiefs on the Prime Minister’s advice, while the CDF will be constitutionally empowered to command all three services.A new position Commander of the National Strategic Command will oversee Pakistan’s nuclear and strategic arsenal. Dawn reported that the commander must be an officer from the Army, appointed by the Prime Minister on the recommendation of the CDF. This further cements the Army Chief’s control over nuclear command authority.The bill also grants unprecedented rights to officers who attain five-star ranks such as Field Marshal, Marshal of the Air Force, or Admiral of the Fleet.Law minister Tarar clarified that Parliament not the Pakistan Prime Minister will have the power to cancel such titles.The amendment does not stop at the military. The second half of the proposal restructures Pakistan’s judicial system.According to Geo News, the bill establishes a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC): a powerful new judicial body that would:Legal experts quoted by Dawn warned that the changes could “dethrone” the Supreme Court as Pakistan’s top judicial authority. One senior counsel said the Supreme Court risked being turned into a “Supreme District Court”, dealing mostly with ordinary appeals, while constitutional matters shift to the FCC.Former additional attorney general Tariq Mehmood Khokhar argued that the amendment tightens executive control over the judiciary and “empowers the FCC by disempowering the Supreme Court”.However, other senior lawyers called it a “forward-looking reform”. They say separating constitutional and appellate functions would reduce delays, depoliticise the Supreme Court and bring Pakistan closer to judicial models in other democracies.The bill has triggered fierce debate in Islamabad. The timing — months after Munir’s elevation and amid delicate coalition negotiations — has intensified public scrutiny.Dawn reported that the proposal surfaced after PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari revealed that PML-N leaders, including Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, requested PPP support for constitutional reforms.Government allies insist the reform merely formalises existing military structures and honours national heroes. Critics say it permanently rebalances power in favour of the Army.If adopted, the 27th Constitutional Amendment will be one of Pakistan’s most consequential defence reforms since the 1980s, dissolving one of the military’s oldest offices, raising the Army Chief to unprecedented constitutional supremacy, and reshaping Pakistan’s highest courts.","Pakistan's government has moved ahead with one of the most sweeping structural changes to the country’s constitutional and military setup in decades.

Donald Trump Stuns Shehbaz Sharif With India-Pak Peace Remark After Gaza Ceasefire Summit In Egypt

Deadlock Deepens: Afghanistan Calls Pakistan Irresponsible As Peace Talks Break Down Once Again

(With ANI inputs)





NEW DELHI: A day after peace talks between Afghanistan and Pakistan in Turkey broke down, the Taliban on Saturday accused “elements within the Pakistani military” of pursuing “anti-Afghanistan policies for years. ”“Unfortunately, certain military elements in Pakistan appear to view a stable and strong Afghanistan as contrary to their interests,” Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said in a statement on X. “They have long exploited Afghanistan’s instability, conflicts, and displacement, and now seem intent on creating tensions through fabricated pretexts.”Mujahid also rejected claims that the rise of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) was linked to the Taliban’s return to power in Kabul. “Some groups have falsely accused the Islamic Emirate, suggesting that instability in Pakistan and the TTP’s growth began with our arrival. In reality, both date back to 2002, a result of misguided policies by certain Pakistani military elements who aligned with the US, permitted drone strikes in Waziristan, and turned against their own people,” he wrote.He pointed to a series of Pakistani military campaigns against the TTP — including Operations Al-Mizan, Rah-e-Rast, Sher Dil, Nijat, Koh-e-Safid, and Zarb-e-Azb — that, he said, displaced hundreds of thousands of civilians.“In this so-called war on terror, 80,000–90,000 soldiers and civilians were killed, by Islamabad’s own count, long before the Islamic Emirate’s rise,” Mujahid added.Calling Pakistan’s instability “an internal issue,” Mujahid remarked the Taliban has taken steps to prevent cross-border militancy since taking power. These include mediating dialogue among political and religious figures, relocating refugees from the Durand Line, banning weapons among refugee populations, and issuing fatwas against unauthorized foreign jihad.“The Islamic Emirate welcomes all efforts that allow refugees to return safely,” he stated, reaffirming that Afghanistan would not allow its territory to be used to interfere in another country’s affairs.","The Taliban accused “elements within the Pakistani military’ of pursuing “anti- Afghanistan policies for years” “They have long exploited Afghanistan’s instability, conflicts, and displacement, and now seem intent on creating tensions through fabricated pretexts,” Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125186693,imgsize-78016,width-400,resizemode-4/taliban-accuses-pakistani-military-of-fueling-instability-through-quotmanufactured-pretextsquot.jpg"

Why Pakistani critics are skeptical?







Taking ""lessons"" from tensions with India, Pakistan has moved to fortify the constitutional basis of military command, signaling a push to modernize defense structures and tighten civilian-military coherence. Its law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, on Saturday, tabled the 27th Constitutional Amendment Bill in the upper house, a move aimed at revising Article 243 to formally enshrine the appointments and parallel ranks of the Army, Air, and Naval chiefs.Citing “lessons” from recent India-Pakistan standoffs, Tarar said the nature of modern warfare had changed, requiring constitutional alignment with evolving command realities.“Recent Pakistan-India tensions have taught us many lessons. The nature and strategy of war have completely changed. Appointment procedures and some positions were previously in the Army Act but were not mentioned in the 1973 Constitution. Parallel ranks exist worldwide for Air Chief and Naval Chief,” Tarar said.The move, however, has come under scanner as many believe it could give more power to military than the civilian government in Pakistan.India, on May 7, launched Operation Sindoor against terror sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, killing over 100 terrorists and targeting key JeM and LeT camps. The move, which came in retaliation to Pahalgam terror attack, turned into a major India-Pakistan issue with the latter also launching a military operation against India.By May 10, the two nations announced a ceasefire after Pakistan approached India for truce talks.Ten days after the truce, Pakistani army general Asim Munir was promoted to the rank of field marshal, the principal military advisor to the prime minister and the president of Pakistan on all matters related to national security. Before Munir, former Pakistan President Genral Ayub Khan had self elevated himself to field marshal in 1959.The proposed changes to Article 243 in Pakistan's Constitution, are designed to significantly bolster the authority of the military, specifically, army chief and recently designated field marshal Asim Munir. Here's how:According to an article by Pakistani media outlet Dawn, legal experts in Pakistan remain divided on whether such institutional adjustments truly warrant a constitutional amendment, noting that most operational reforms can be achieved through ordinary legislation rather than altering Article 243.Constitutional experts argued that modernising command structures or creating a Chief of Defence Staff-type position does not require amending Article 243. Such reforms could be introduced through ordinary legislation or defence rules. Altering the Constitution, they warned, risks expanding military autonomy under the guise of structural integration.Another confusion surrounding Article 243 stems from the changes introduced by the 26th Amendment, which extended the army chief’s tenure from three to five years. The current chief, appointed under the old law and later elevated to the ceremonial rank of field marshal, a position not mentioned in the Constitution, has become the focal point of legal ambiguity.Dawn reported that experts remain divided on whether his term automatically extends under the new law or requires a fresh notification, raising questions about the real intent behind the proposed 27th Amendment: to resolve this technical uncertainty or to further cement the military’s influence within Pakistan’s constitutional framework.","Pakistan's law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, on Saturday, tabled the 27th Constitutional Amendment Bill in the upper house.

Trade paralysis and a deepening food crisis

Water shortage adds to worries – dams running dry





(With inputs from agencies)





Pakistan’s twin cities are staring at a worsening flour emergency after the Punjab food department halted wheat supplies to mills in Rawalpindi and Islamabad, triggering panic across markets and raising questions over the country’s fragile food security. The sudden suspension has deepened an already tense economic climate, with transport blockades, water shortages and declining dam levels all feeding fears of another nationwide crisis.Dealers say all existing orders for flour, wheat and fine flour were cancelled from Friday night, leaving shops and tandoor owners without stock, PTI reported citing the The Express Tribune.The Rawalpindi Flour Mills Association, which held an emergency meeting to address the crisis, warned that “production will remain paralysed” unless wheat permits are restored immediately. The association described the ban as “ill-considered” and cautioned that shortages could spiral into a humanitarian emergency in the federal capital and adjoining regions.Flour inflation has shot up at record pace, prompting anger from bakers and retailers. According to the Pakistan Naanbai Association, the price of a 79-kilogram sack of red flour has doubled to PKR 11,000 since the Shehbaz Sharif–Maryam Nawaz government took office.Fine flour, used widely for bread and bakery items, has risen from PKR 6,200 to PKR 12,600.The association’s president, Shafiq Qureshi, accused authorities of “state oppression”, claiming that dozens of tandoors have been demolished and nearly a hundred sealed for selling roti at higher prices in line with rising flour rates. Many owners have been fined between PKR 25,000 and PKR 50,000. “Instead of fixing the wheat supply, they are taking out their frustration on us,” Qureshi said, warning that families are being pushed to breaking point as bread becomes increasingly unaffordable.While wheat supply chokes Punjab’s food chain, Pakistan’s transport routes are already gridlocked due to deteriorating relations with Afghanistan. Thousands of trucks carrying food items, pharmaceuticals and export consignments for Afghanistan and Central Asia have been stranded at ports and highways.Senior Vice Chairman of the Goods Transport Association Imdad Hussain Naqvi said drivers are stuck without food, water or security. “This is not just a loss for transporters; it's a loss for the entire state,” he said, as quoted by PTI. He further warned that perishable goods are rotting on highways and thousands of workers are on the brink of starvation.The current wheat crisis comes months after India regulated flows from the Chenab following the Pahalgam terror attack. The move had contributed to a sharp drop in water levels at the country’s two key dams, Mangla and Tarbela.Pakistan is among six countries with the highest levels of inefficient agricultural water use, worsening freshwater losses amid arid conditions, according to the World Bank’s first global water monitoring report, Continental Drying: A Threat to Our Common Future.The study highlights that inefficient irrigation in drying regions—particularly in Pakistan, Algeria, Cambodia, Mexico, Thailand, Tunisia, and Romania—drives massive water waste, with more than two-thirds linked to water-intensive crops.","Flour inflation has shot up at record pace, prompting anger from bakers and retailers.

DHAKA: Former Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina was on Monday sentenced to death in absentia by a tribunal for ""crimes against humanity"" over her govt's crackdown on a ""nationwide mass uprising"" last year that led to her ouster. She was accused of crimes such as murder, attempted murder and torture, and other inhumane acts as well as ordering the use of lethal weapons, helicopters and drones to subdue protesters.The Bangladesh International Crimes Tribunal's (ICT) verdict, which came months before the parliamentary election, described Hasina, 78, as the ""mastermind and principal architect"" of the violent repression that killed hundreds of protesters, including students. Hasina, whose Awami League has been barred from contesting the poll scheduled to be held in Feb, fled to India in Aug 5 last year amid the unrest.In a statement, Hasina described the ICT as a ""rigged tribunal established and presided over by an unelected govt with no democratic mandate"", referring to the Muhammad Yunus-led interim govt. The judgment is ""biased and politically motivated"" and ""in their distasteful call for death penalty, they reveal the brazen and murderous intent of extremist figures within the interim govt to remove Bangladesh's last elected PM and nullify Awami League as a political force,"" Hasina said.The ICT also handed death sentence to her close aide and former home minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal on similar charges. The third accused in the case and former inspector general of police Chowdhury Abdullah Al-Mamun, who testified as a state witness, was sentenced to five years in prison.Hasina said the charges were unjustified, arguing that she and Khan ""acted in good faith and were trying to minimise the loss of life.

(With inputs from agencies)





For nearly two decades, Sheikh Hasina stood at the pinnacle of Bangladeshi politics. The daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the country’s founding father, she built a reputation as a transformative leader. Under her rule, Bangladesh recorded major infrastructure gains, such as the Padma Bridge, witnessed rapid economic growth, and became a global hub for garment manufacturing.That era came to an abrupt and violent halt in August 2024. Student-led protests erupted over a quota system in public-sector jobs but soon escalated into a nationwide uprising dubbed the “July Uprising” aimed at Hasina’s rule itself. Security forces responded with force. On August 5, Hasina, sensing her hold on power slipping, fled Bangladesh and crossed into India, entering self-imposed exile.What makes Hasina’s story especially extraordinary is that she was ousted by a tribunal she once helped establish. The International Crimes Tribunal (ICT), created in 2010 by her government to try war criminals from the 1971 Liberation War, has now become the body that condemned her. After her departure, Bangladesh’s interim government, led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus , refocused the tribunal’s mission: to prosecute Hasina and her closest aides over what it calls “crimes against humanity” during last year’s crackdown.Also read: Bangladesh's ousted PM Sheikh Hasina sentenced to death; key takeaways from verdict In June 2025, the tribunal framed formal charges spanning nearly 8,750 pages, accusing Hasina, her then–home minister Asaduzzaman Khan (Kamal), and then–police chief Chowdhury Abdullah Al-Mamun of ordering or failing to prevent mass killings, torture and other atrocities during the July–August protests. The prosecution painted Hasina as the “mastermind” of a campaign that used live ammunition, drones, helicopters and even arson to suppress dissent.After a months-long trial and 28 working days of testimony, the three-judge panel of ICT-1 delivered a landmark verdict. Justice Md Golam Mortuza Mozumder, presiding over the tribunal, declared that Hasina was guilty on three counts: incitement to violence, ordering the use of lethal force, and failure to prevent atrocities.She was sentenced to death in absentia, becoming the first former Bangladeshi prime minister to receive such a punishment. Alongside Hasina, former Home Minister Kamal also received a death sentence. The only co-accused present in court, ex–police chief Al-Mamun, was spared execution: he received a prison term of five years after turning state witness.The tribunal’s 453-page judgment detailed allegations that Hasina directly ordered the use of helicopters, drones and live ammunition; that in Chankharpul and Ashulia, security forces shot unarmed protesters and burned bodies to destroy evidence.From her exile in New Delhi, the 78-year-old Hasina issued a defiant reaction. She called the verdict “biased and politically motivated,” claiming the court was a “rigged tribunal” created by an unelected interim government seeking to sideline her permanently. In a written statement, she rejected the entire proceeding, calling it a “charade” orchestrated by political rivals.In previous interviews, she denied ordering security forces to fire on civilians, saying, “I categorically deny such allegations. I never told them to fire on unarmed citizens,” though she acknowledged the situation spiralled out of control.Also read: India reacts to Sheikh Hasina verdict; Yunus govt calls for ex-PM’s return She has also expressed willingness to stand trial internationally, underlining her rejection of what she terms a domestic kangaroo court.The verdict raises a standoff with India, where Hasina now lives. Bangladesh’s government has invoked the 2013 extradition treaty with New Delhi, demanding Hasina’s handover “as a mandatory obligation”.Dhaka’s foreign ministry warned that sheltering a convicted “mass murderer” would be seen as an unfriendly act. However, that very treaty contains a political-offense exemption: it allows India to refuse extradition if it deems the charges are of a political character. Analysts believe Hasina’s offence will be treated as political; indeed, Indian officials have so far merely “engaged constructively” and given no sign of deporting her.Under the extradition treaty, New Delhi is not obliged to return her. The treaty allows India to refuse extradition if the alleged offences are deemed political or if surrendering the accused would be “unjust or oppressive”. Given the political turmoil surrounding her removal and trial, India could legally decline any request.Hasina may still appeal the conviction through Bangladesh’s Supreme Court.Meanwhile, India has called for dialogue saying that it will continue to engage “constructively” and remains “committed to the best interests of the people of Bangladesh.”The convictions stem from Bangladesh’s most violent political unrest in decades. What began in July 2024 as a student movement against a quota system for government jobs quickly exploded.Students protested a court decision to reinstate a policy reserving 30% of civil service posts for descendants of 1971 war veterans, a system seen by many as unfair patronage. Thousands of young people took to the streets, soon joined by opposition party members and urban workers. By 19 July the government imposed a curfew and a nationwide internet blackout as the army was called in to suppress the demonstrations. Security forces and ruling-party student militias clashed with protesters in many cities.The unrest then turned violent. Human rights observers estimate hundreds to over a thousand people were killed as police, paramilitaries and even army units fired indiscriminately on protesters. The United Nations fact-finding report later concluded up to 1,400 people may have been killed and thousands wounded during the days of protest, mostly by live ammunition from security forces. Bangladeshi officials initially reported around 800 dead and 14,000 injured.Bangladeshi authorities justified the crackdown by accusing protest leaders of inciting chaos and violence. Prime Minister Hasina publicly branded the movement’s activists as “Razakars” a term for wartime traitors claiming they were being manipulated by the main opposition party (the BNP) and foreign enemies. Government media portrayed protesters as miscreants bent on toppling an elected government.The uprising ultimately led to Hasina’s ouster. On August 5, 2024 Sheikh Hasina resigned under pressure, the army declared a 15-day state of emergency, and a neutral interim government was installed under Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus. The trial of Hasina along with Khan and Al-Mamun became the highest-profile case emerging from what protesters had dubbed the “July Revolution” or “Monsoon Uprising.”Elected in 2009, Hasina’s Awami League won a dominant position in Bangladeshi politics. Under her rule, Bangladesh did see rapid economic growth, expanded infrastructure and social programmes.But critics say those achievements came at the cost of democratic institutions. International observers and local activists say Hasina gradually weakened independent institutions, the media, courts and electoral bodies to stay in power.Election observers reported irregularities in her landslide victories, notably the 2014 and 2018 polls which the main opposition boycotted.A Human Rights Watch report noted that by her third term Hasina’s government had “captured key institutions” and routinely silenced, harassed or even disappeared opposition figures and critics. Freedoms of assembly and speech were severely curtailed, and dissent was often labeled as anti-state activity.The last election she won was declared by critics as neither free nor fair.Her record is inevitably contrasted with that of her father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Mujib revered as Bangladesh’s founding father after leading the independence movement against Pakistan in 1971 served as the country’s first president and later prime minister in 1972-75.He was immensely popular for achieving sovereignty, but in his final year his rule turned authoritarian. In 1975 Mujib imposed a one-party “BKSAL” system and suppressed dissent amid economic crisis and famine. His government’s authoritarian turn alarmed many, and on 15 August 1975 Mujib was assassinated in a military coup.Both father and daughter led Bangladesh for lengthy terms and faced enormous political opposition. Both expanded state control over many aspects of life. But Mujib’s overthrow in 1975 highlights the peril in Hasina’s fate: dynastic rule has repeatedly sparked instability. After Mujib’s death, Bangladesh swung through decades of coups and military regimes.Also read: Sheikh Hasina's first reaction after being sentenced to death; calls verdict 'biased' Hasina herself spent years in exile in the 1980s and returned to power in the 1990s to restore democracy. Her political arch-rival, the BNP, is led by another powerful family dynasty, the widow of assassinated President Ziaur Rahman . In Bangladesh, the rivalry of these dynasties (Sheikh versus Zia) has fuelled polarization.His image once loomed over the country’s banknotes, monuments and public memory. But during 'July uprising’’, even such symbols have come under scrutiny: a golden statue of Mujibur Rahman was torn down by protesters after Hasina’s ousting.Bangladesh’s modern history has indeed been a pendulum swing between civilian rule and military power. The country’s story since independence in 1971 is dominated by coups, uprisings and assassinations.Soon after independence, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s assassination in 1975 unleashed a period of purges and counter-coups. A four-day counter-coup by Maj. Gen. Khaled Musharraf was itself overthrown by forces loyal to Major Gen. Ziaur Rahman, who eventually became president. Zia was assassinated in 1981 during an abortive coup. General Hussain Muhammad Ershad seized power in 1982 and ruled as military dictator until 1990, when mass pro-democracy protests forced his resignation.Even after democracy was restored, the army remained a powerful force; it staged a virtual coup in 2007 by backing a technocratic caretaker government (with US and regional support) to break a political deadlock.Throughout these upheavals, the population has suffered repeatedly. Scores of political leaders and hundreds of soldiers have died in the violence of coups. Politics became a zero-sum game between the two main parties Awami League and BNP often with neither side willing to accept defeat or allow an opponent to govern peacefully. Elections themselves have sometimes been spark points for unrest. The only periods of stability have been those carefully negotiated or enforced by consensus for example, the (delayed) scheduled elections under the caretaker system in 1991 and again in 2008.Today’s verdict is the latest in this turbulent saga. It is the harshest punishment ever imposed on a Bangladeshi leader, echoing the fate of Ershad who got 10 years in 1991 for illegal weapons and even Mujib in exile.But it also reflects long-standing problems: political trials, the use of tribunals for settling scores, and the resort to lethal repression.Hasina’s death sentence, pronounced in absentia, leaves many practical questions hanging. India, where she has been living since August 2024.The verdict has provoked both jubilation and unrest in Dhaka. Security was already tightened around the tribunal in the run-up to the announcement. The atmosphere in Dhaka remains tense, with fears that the death sentence could escalate political instability ahead of planned elections in February 2026.One year ago, Sheikh Hasina stood as Bangladesh’s most powerful leader, often described as its “Iron Lady.” Today, she is in exile, convicted of crimes against humanity, and sentenced to death by a tribunal she once controlled.","Sheikh Hasina was accused of ordering security forces to use drones, helicopters and live ammunition on protesters. This deployment resulted in dozens of civilian deaths. She was also found guilty of incitement to kill. The court ruled that Hasina “committed crimes against humanity by her incitement order”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125390185,imgsize-1224948,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

Ousted Bangladesh PM Hasina Calls ICT’s Death Sentence ‘Rigged’, Says It Denied Fair Trial Rights





Hours after a special tribunal in Bangladesh handed down a death sentence to ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina , India on Monday said it had taken note of the verdict and would continue ""engaging constructively"" with all stakeholders to support peace, democracy and stability in the neighbouring country.The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said India remains committed to the welfare of the Bangladeshi people.Hasina was convicted of crimes against humanity by the country's International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) and given the death penalty.The Awami League leader has been staying in India since she fled Bangladesh on August 5 last year amid massive protests.""India has noted the verdict announced by the 'International Crimes Tribunal of Bangladesh' concerning former prime minister Sheikh Hasina,"" the MEA said.""As a close neighbour, India remains committed to the best interests of the people of Bangladesh, including in peace, democracy, inclusion and stability in that country,"" it said.""We will always engage constructively with all stakeholders to that end,"" the MEA added.Earlier, Bangladesh's interim government urged India to immediately extradite deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina and her former home minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal, hours after a special tribunal sentenced them to death in absentia for ""crimes against humanity"".""We urge the Indian government to immediately hand over these two convicted individuals to the Bangladeshi authorities,"" the Foreign Ministry said in a statement, according to the state-run BSS news agency.It said the existing bilateral extradition agreement between Bangladesh and India marks the transfer of the two convicts as a compulsory responsibility for New Delhi.The ministry also said that granting shelter to individuals convicted of crimes against humanity would be considered an ""unfriendly"" act and a disregard for justice.Criticising the verdicts, Hasina described the process as “rigged” and alleged that the drive for a death sentence was a calculated effort by hardline officials to sideline her and undermine her party, Awami League.""In their distasteful call for the death penalty, they reveal the brazen and murderous intent of extremist figures within the interim government to remove Bangladesh’s last elected prime minister, and to nullify the Awami League as a political force,"" Hasina added.She also defended her record in office, citing Bangladesh’s accession to the International Criminal Court, the sheltering of Rohingya refugees, major gains in electricity access and education, and significant economic growth that lifted millions out of poverty.","India says it will continue ""engaging constructively"" with all stakeholders to support peace, democracy and stability in the neighbouring country.

Protests erupted in Bangladesh following ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina' death sentence over 'crimes against humanity'. Demonstrators clashed with security forces while trying to pull down the remaining parts of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s house. The Rapid Action Battalion moved in to block the attempt, using batons, sound grenades and tear gas to drive the protesters back. Police told the Daily Star that at least six sound grenades went off on Mirpur Road.“Several sound grenades were used to disperse the protesters,” said Masud Alam. Both protesters and police were injured as bricks were thrown and officers carried out baton-charges.Even after being pushed away once, some protesters gathered again near Square Hospital on Panthapath, where police fired more tear gas. Traffic on Mirpur Road and nearby areas stopped completely, and most shops shut their shutters.Police had controlled both sides of Mirpur Road earlier in the day, but around 2:45pm they stepped back as protesters pushed forward. By about 3:05pm, the army, police and Rab moved in together with batons and sound grenades and took back control of the area, the agency reported.The protesters had brought two excavators before the protests broke out, showing they planned to dismantle the house.Parts of the building had already been damaged in a protest in February. Police set up barricades at the front gate and have not allowed anyone inside since.Witnesses said crowds began gathering from around 11:30am, marching towards Dhanmondi 32 and shouting slogans against the deposed prime minister.They chanted “Delhi na Dhaka? Dhaka, Dhaka!”; “Bottrish na Chhottrish? Chhottrish, Chhottrish!”; “Dalali na Mukti? Mukti, Mukti!”; and “Khuni Hasinar Fashi Chai,” the Daily Star reported.Earlier in the day, Bangladesh’s interim government called the death sentence given to Sheikh Hasina a “historic verdict”. It has also urged people to stay calm, show restraint and act responsibly after the ruling.The court said she was responsible both for giving orders and for failing to stop the killings during the unrest.However, the former PM responded, ""the verdicts announced against me have been made by a rigged tribunal established and presided over by an unelected government with no democratic mandate.”She also called the ruling ""biased and politically motivated.”",Protests erupted in Bangladesh following ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina' death sentence over 'crimes against humanity' Demonstrators clashed with security forces while trying to pull down the remaining parts of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s house.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125385767,imgsize-193244,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

Bangladesh On Edge: Ex-PM Sheikh Hasina Rejects Evidence, Son Issues Threat Before Tribunal Verdict

Can Hasina challenge the death verdict?





Quote by Sheikh Hasina ​​

Will Hasina be extradited?









Bangladesh’s International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) on Monday sentenced ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina to death after finding her guilty of ""crimes against humanity"".The tribunal ruled that Hasina had ordered killings, incited violence and failed to prevent the atrocities committed during the July and August 2024 ""student uprising"", after which escaped to India and remains reportedly in New Delhi since.Judge Golam Mortuza Mozumder told the crowded courtroom that she had been found guilty on three counts and that the court had decided to impose a single punishment which was the sentence of death.Hasina defied the International Crimes Tribunal’s decision, claiming that the ruling, linked to the student-led protests of August 2024, was “biased and politically motivated.”Also read: Protesters try to destroy Mujibur Rahman's house; forces use batons, tear gas - video She acknowledged the government had lost control of the situation at the time but maintained that the unrest did not amount to a ""premeditated"" assault on civilians.""We lost control of the situation but cannot characterise what happened as premeditated assault on citizens,"" Hasina said.Hasina said she is willing to face the charges against her before a legitimate court, insisting she has no fear of a fair, evidence-based trial.Hasina criticised the verdicts, calling the process “rigged” and driven by an unelected interim government. She claimed the push for a death sentence showed a deliberate attempt by hardline officials to remove her from politics and weaken her party, Awami League.Whether Hasina can challenge the verdict is now a central question. Under the International Crimes Tribunals Act of 1973, a convicted person has the right to appeal directly to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh. This is provided in Section 21(1), which states that any person convicted under Section 3 of the Act may appeal to the highest court.The law gives the convicted thirty days to file the appeal, as laid out in Section 21(2). Although Hasina is in India, the Act does not prevent her from appealing through authorised counsel or diplomatic channels.Also read: Sheikh Hasina's first reaction after being sentenced to death; calls verdict 'biased' The Act does not allow appeals against interim or procedural orders issued by the tribunal during the trial. This means Hasina could not have challenged earlier rulings before the final judgment. After her appeal is decided, any order passed by the Appellate Division may still be reviewed under Section 22 of the Act, which allows the Supreme Court to reconsider its own decisions if an error is shown or new material emerges.Apart from the judicial process, the Constitution of Bangladesh gives the President the power to pardon, commute or remit any sentence, including a death sentence.If Bangladesh renews its effort to extradite Hasina, New Delhi would not be automatically bound to comply. The India-Bangladesh Extradition Treaty of 2013 allows refusal if the alleged offence is considered political in nature, a provision reflected in Article 6 of the treaty.The treaty also permits refusal if extradition would be ""unjust or oppressive"" in the circumstances, as stated in Article 8. India would therefore be within its legal rights to decline any request if it believes the charges or trial have political overtones.Hasina was removed from office on August 5 last year and fled to India shortly after. Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus was installed as head of an interim government three days later, vowing to bring her to justice and prohibiting the Awami League from carrying out any political activity.Both Hasina and her party have dismissed the trial as a political setup and accused the state of appointing a lawyer to represent her without her consent.Yunus has said his interim government plans to hold elections in February and that the Awami League will not be allowed to take part. Bangladesh's politics under Yunus has remained at a crossroads with limited signs of stability, and the legal battle over Hasina's conviction is now set to become another defining chapter in the country's turbulent transition.","Sheikh Hasina was sentenced to death by Bangladesh's International Crimes Tribunal.

Ousted Bangladesh PM Hasina Calls ICT’s Death Sentence ‘Rigged’, Says It Denied Fair Trial Rights





Former Bangladesh prime minister Sheikh Hasina on Monday slammed the International Crimes Tribunal’s decision to sentence her to death on charges of “crimes against humanity”.In a statement, Hasina claimed that the ruling, linked to the student-led protests of August 2024, was “biased and politically motivated.”""The verdicts announced against me have been made by a rigged tribunal established and presided over by an unelected government with no democratic mandate,"" Hasina said. ""They are biased and politically motivated. Its guilty verdict against me was a foregone conclusion.""She acknowledged the government had lost control of the situation at the time but maintained that the unrest did not amount to a ""premeditated"" assault on civilians.""We lost control of the situation but cannot characterise what happened as premeditated assault on citizens,"" Hasina said.Criticising the verdicts, Hasina described the process as “rigged” and alleged that the drive for a death sentence was a calculated effort by hardline officials to sideline her and undermine her party, Awami League.Also read: Bangladesh's ousted PM Sheikh Hasina sentenced to death; key takeaways from verdict ""In their distasteful call for the death penalty, they reveal the brazen and murderous intent of extremist figures within the interim government to remove Bangladesh’s last elected prime minister, and to nullify the Awami League as a political force,"" Hasina added.She defended her record in office, citing Bangladesh’s accession to the International Criminal Court, the sheltering of Rohingya refugees, major gains in electricity access and education, and significant economic growth that lifted millions out of poverty.""We led Bangladesh to join the International Criminal Court in 2010, gave refuge to hundreds of thousands of Rohingya fleeing persecution in Myanmar, expanded access to electricity and education, and presided over a 450% GDP growth over 15 years, lifting millions out of poverty.

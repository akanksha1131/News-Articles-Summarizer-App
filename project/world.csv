Germany New Year'S Fireworks: Germany: 4 killed in warehouse fire amid New Year's fireworks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/germany-4-killed-in-warehouse-fire-amid-new-years-fireworks/articleshow/116869036.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: AP)

More than 300 arrests in Berlin

Major warehouse fire in Neuwied, timber ablaze

Pyrotechnics association says illegal fireworks are the problem

Germany's raucous New Year's celebrations led to a typically busy night for emergency services overnight and into the early hours of Wednesday.Police and fire services around the country reported at least four fatal injuries the following morning, seemingly connected to explosions.In several cities, emergency services were pelted by pyrotechnics — a recurring trend in recent years. One Berlin officer was severely hurt and required surgery.The capital's university hospital said it was treating eight people with severe hand injuries and ""the night is still young"" soon after midnight. It later updated the figure to 15.Berlin police issued an update in the early hours of Wednesday, praising the implementation of new no-fireworks zones in the city centre — but still reporting widespread issues outside those areas.""We have had to carry out around 320 arrests, in several cases both rescue workers and police came under fire [from pyrotechnics],"" Berlin police spokesman Florian Nath said in a video posted online. Berlin police were escorting fire crews in the city for their own safety, a move police said had helped.""We also have a severely injured police officer who appears to have been hit by an illegal firework,"" Nath said, adding he underwent emergency surgery overnight.Cologne's police said that two officers were injured by illegal fireworks and that fireworks had been shot at officers and firefighters. A group of around 50 people in Leipzig attacked emergency services. Similar reports and images emerged from parts of Hamburg and elsewhere.Fire crews were in action all over the country dealing with smaller fires — garbage cans, houses, cars, garages and other items found near the pavements.In Neuwied, a small city in western Germany, though, police suspected a firework caused one blaze at a warehouse that grew to a serious size before being reported shortly before 1 a.m.""At the site a large warehouse, storing timber among other things, was discovered fully ablaze,"" Neuwied/Rhein police said in a statement. Affected locals were cleared from nearby homes by emergency services and the fire was brought under control, it said.""Work to extinguish the fire continues,"" police said in an update at around 6 a.m. ""The severe heat build-up also caused damage to nearby buildings."" They estimated costs to be in ""a medium six-figure range.""""The cause for this fire is most likely also a New Year's firework. Investigations into this continue,"" police said, a matter of hours after having responded to a similar blaze in the town centre.Police, medical professionals and firefighters have more than once recommended a firework ban, or at least some restrictions on the mass New Year's Eve fireworks amnesty practised in Germany, in recent years. The practice was shut down for two years amid COVID-19, albeit then to limit public gatherings.The German Pyrotechnics Association, meanwhile, said that the deaths and serious injuries could be traced back to illegal firework usage.""These extremely dangerous DIY jobs have nothing to do with legal and checked New Year's fireworks"" from approved handlers, board member Ingo Schubert said.He argued that serious injury was ""all but ruled out"" even in cases of improper usage of approved fireworks and said the onus should be on authorities to crack down on illegal pyrotechnics, not those sold in shops.","Police and fire services report at least four fatal injuries the following morning, seemingly connected to explosions.

New Orleans faces the aftermath

New Year’s revelers in New Orleans were left in shock and horror after a truck plowed into the crowd on Bourbon Street, leaving twisted and horribly disfigured bodies scattered across the sidewalk. Eyewitness accounts describe a nightmare that unfolded in the blink of an eye, as a terrorist attack turned the bustling street into a scene of chaos, destruction, and unimaginable loss.Jimmy Cothran, who was among those seeking refuge in a nightclub, recounted the shocking aftermath. ""Dead right in front of us was someone’s mother, twisted, obviously deceased,"" he told NBC News. He continued, his voice trembling, ""One man, deceased, had tire tracks across his back and when someone turned him over, he had tire tracks across his stomach and was clearly crushed.""But the most heart-wrenching moment came when Cothran described the lifeless body of a little girl, “a little girl that we had seen dancing as we were walking up the street.” ""She was as flat as a pillow,"" he said, his words trailing off as he recalled the sheer horror of what unfolded before his eyes. ""It just kept going. Every eye shot — body, body, body, body. It was unbelievable,"" reported the Post.Another eyewitness, who identified himself only as Paul S., gave a chilling account of the scene. He was in his hotel room when he first heard what sounded like gunfire, followed by the deafening roar of an explosion that sounded like fireworks. He soon stepped out onto the balcony, where the view of Bourbon Street was horrifying. ""We heard a ‘pop, pop, pop, pop’ sound, followed by a sound that sounded like fireworks going off, like a big firework all at once, and it turned out that was the crash,"" he told ABC.What he saw when he looked down at Bourbon Street was a scene straight out of a horror movie. ""There’s litter all over the sidewalks, and then there were bodies laid up next to garbage cans and people rushing to give aid,” Paul S. recalled. The street, once bustling with partygoers, was now eerily silent except for the people frantically trying to help the victims.For 18-year-old Parsons, who was celebrating with friends, the terror began with the screech of tires. ""Real-life horror movie,"" he said, describing the scene as the truck barreled through the crowd. ""Everything the car is hitting, it’s getting thrown. It’s getting thrown up into the air and away and just under the car.” He and his friends ducked for cover in a space between two bars, but when he emerged, the sight was gut-wrenching.""One of my friends, a woman, was lying in the street, badly injured but alive,"" Parsons said, voice shaking. ""But farther down, there were bodies littered throughout the entire street.” The chaos left emergency crews scrambling, and Parsons, not knowing what had happened to his injured friend, feared the worst. ""I don’t know where they took her. I don’t know her condition,"" he said, unable to shake the image of her lying there, helpless.Authorities reported that the suspect drove the truck through a busy intersection at the south end of Bourbon Street, an area packed with nightclubs and revelers. The attack was particularly devastating as the steel barriers, which would normally have been in place to prevent such incidents, had been removed a few weeks earlier for the upcoming Super Bowl. The city was in the process of replacing them, but their absence proved catastrophic.Bob Simms, who previously oversaw security for the French Quarter, said the old barriers might not have been enough to stop the truck even if they had been in place. ""They were very ineffective. The track was always full of crap; beads and doubloons and God knows what else,"" he said. ""Not the best idea.""As New Orleans grapples with the aftermath of the brutal attack, the scale of the tragedy is becoming clearer with each passing hour. Families are left devastated, survivors traumatized, and the city must now pick up the pieces of what was supposed to be a night of celebration turned into a nightmare.","Eyewitnesses describe horror of New Orleans terror attack.

Witnesses’ accounts

A vehicle plowed into a crowd on Bourbon Street in New Orleans' French Quarter early Wednesday, leaving at least 15 dead and 30 injured. The incident occurred in the early morning hours. Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick said the driver was “trying to run over as many people as he possibly could.”The driver was killed in a shootout with police following the attack. Two officers also sustained injuries. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is leading the investigation and has classified the incident as an act of terrorism.The FBI confirmed the suspect's death in a statement, saying, “This morning, an individual drove a car into a crowd of people on Bourbon Street in New Orleans, killing a number of people and injuring dozens of others. The subject then engaged with local law enforcement and is now deceased. The FBI is the lead investigative agency, and we are working with our partners to investigate this as an act of terrorism.”The incident occurred around 3:15 am local time as people celebrated the New Year in New Orleans' French Quarter. The suspect drove a white Ford F-150 electric pickup truck into a crowd of pedestrians. After exiting the vehicle, the suspect exchanged gunfire with police and was killed. Two officers sustained injuries but are expected to recover. The FBI reported finding and neutralizing two homemade bombs at the scene.Police chief Shaun Kirkpatrick said that the driver ""was hellbent on creating the carnage and the damage that he did.""The attack caused a 24-hour delay for the Sugar Bowl, a college football game between the University of Georgia and Notre Dame, scheduled for later that day.The truck driver intentionally drove into a crowd at high speed, according to Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick. “This man was trying to run over as many people as he possibly could,” Kirkpatrick told reporters. She said the truck was driven ""at very high speed"" and in a ""very intentional"" manner. The driver “was hellbent on creating the carnage and the damage that he did.”Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry called the incident a “horrific act of violence.”New Year’s Eve saw a large police presence in the city due to anticipated crowds. The city police department deployed all its officers ""100 percent,"" with an additional 300 officers assisting from partner law enforcement agencies. Some officers patrolled on horseback and in unmarked vehicles.A 42-year-old Texas man and Army veteran has been identified as the suspect in the attack. Shamsud-Din Jabbar, a US citizen, was identified by the FBI. He appears to have worked as a real estate agent in Houston and served as an IT specialist in the military.The attack prompted a manhunt. FBI agent Alethea Duncan said, ""We do not believe that Jabbar was solely responsible.""Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick called Jabbar a ""terrorist."" An ISIS flag was found in a vehicle at the scene, according to the FBI. The agency is investigating Jabbar’s potential ties to terrorist groups.Jabbar served in the Army and Army Reserve between 2007 and 2020, the Pentagon confirmed. His military service included a deployment to Afghanistan from February 2009 to January 2010. He reached the rank of Staff Sergeant.Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry said, ""We're hunting some bad people down.""Following the attack, US President Joe Biden and President-elect Donald Trump issued statements. Biden declared that his administration ""will not tolerate any attack on any of our nation's communities.""Trump connected the attack to illegal immigration without providing evidence. His statement came before officials confirmed the suspect's American citizenship. Trump also incorrectly said the nation's crime rate ""is at a level that nobody has ever seen."" FBI data shows violent crime has decreased nationally.Witnesses described the horrific scene of the attack. Zion Parsons told CNN, ""The best way I can describe it is truly a war zone. There were bodies and blood and all the trash."" He added, ""People were terrified, running, screaming.""Another witness, Jimmy Cothran, told ABC that the aftermath was “insanity.” Cothran said, ""We instantly counted, I'd say, 10 bodies -- six clearly graphically deceased, and the others yelling with no one around.""","A vehicle plowed into a crowd on Bourbon Street in New Orleans' French Quarter early Wednesday, leaving at least 15 dead and 30 injured.

A high-earning professional struggling with debt

A fall from stability to squalor

From military service to terror

A deadly attack on New Year’s eve

Shamsud Din Jabbar , the 42-year-old behind the deadly New Year’s Eve attack in New Orleans, had a stable job as an employee at the prominent accounting firm Deloitte, reportedly earning an annual salary of $120,000. However, despite his relatively high-paying position, Jabbar’s life was marked by financial turmoil that escalated during his second divorce in 2022.New York Post reports reveal that Jabbar, who had a background in IT and military service, was deeply in debt. In emails to his ex-wife’s lawyer, Jabbar admitted to owing over $27,000 in overdue home payments and stated he was at risk of foreclosure. Furthermore, he confessed to racking up more than $16,000 in credit card debt while paying court fees and expenses for a second home. His real estate business, which he had hoped would provide a financial lifeline, had suffered a staggering loss of more than $28,000 the previous year.Jabbar’s personal life took a dramatic turn after his second divorce. He had been married twice and had faced ongoing financial struggles , including child support disputes with his first wife, who sued him in 2012. Despite his job at Deloitte and his military service, Jabbar's financial issues pushed him to a breaking point.In the years following his military service, Jabbar's situation deteriorated, and he found himself living in a dilapidated trailer park in Houston, Texas. The once-promising professional now lived in squalor, surrounded by sheep and goats in his yard. His neighbors, many of whom were Muslim immigrants, knew little about him, with one describing Jabbar as a “simple person” who kept to himself, reported the Post.Jabbar’s journey from a decorated military veteran to a terrorist suspect is as complex as it is tragic. He served in the US Army for over a decade, deploying to Afghanistan, where he worked as an IT specialist. He left the Army in 2015 as a staff sergeant after serving both active duty and as a reservist. Despite the stability of his military career, Jabbar struggled with personal and financial issues that seemed to worsen over time.In a 2020 YouTube video promoting his real estate business, Jabbar portrayed himself as a dependable and trustworthy Texan. However, in the months leading up to the New Orleans attack, he reportedly became more isolated and radicalized. The FBI revealed that Jabbar had made references to the Quran and was reportedly influenced by ISIS ideology , a connection underscored by an ISIS flag found on the truck he used during the attack.On New Year’s Day, Jabbar carried out a premeditated terror attack , driving a rented Ford F-150 truck into a crowd on Bourbon Street, killing 15 people. Following the attack, he exchanged gunfire with police officers and was killed during the confrontation. Authorities confirmed that Jabbar had an ISIS flag on his vehicle, and law enforcement is continuing to investigate potential accomplices.Jabbar’s financial struggles, marital issues, and apparent radicalization have painted a picture of a man who spiraled from a successful career and military service to a life of financial ruin and violent extremism.","Shamsud Din Jabbar served in the US Army for over a decade, deploying to Afghanistan.

There are countries out there that are so small, so remote, or so obscure that they've barely made it onto your radar. These hidden gems are often overshadowed by more famous destinations, yet they have rich histories, vibrant cultures, and stunning landscapes waiting to be explored. From tiny island nations to landlocked territories with fascinating traditions, the world is full of countries that deserve more attention.Whether it's the quirkiness of the name or the location of uniqueness and interesting facts, there must surely be something about these 7 hidden nations to astound you. Want to get informed about some of the world's greatest secrets? Well, pack your bags because, believe it or not, all of these lesser-known countries are off the beaten track.Kiribati is an island nation located in the central Pacific Ocean. It consists of 33 islands, of which 20 are inhabited. The country occupies a very large area of approximately 3.4 million square kilometers, thus ranking as one of the most geographically spread countries in the world. South Tarawa is the capital, which lies on the largest and most populous atoll. The official languages are English and Gilbertese, and the population is mainly Micronesian and Christian.Kiribati is special because it is the first country to welcome every new day, as it lies west of the International Date Line. It is also the home of Kiritimati Island, the largest coral atoll in the world, which is part of the Line Islands group. Interestingly, Kiribati is the only country situated in all four hemispheres: northern, southern, eastern, and western.The locals pronounce the word ""Kiribati"" as ""Kiri-bas,"" replacing 't' with an 's.'As the most incredible fact of its own, Kiribati is the only nation with all of its islands divided among four hemispheres, located in Micronesian regions. Its atolls fall directly across the equator.Kiribati is also one of the most vulnerable countries affected by climate change. The rising sea level has fully submerged one of its atolls. There is an indication from the UN reports that Kiribati might become uninhabitable by 2100 if climate change trends are maintained.Located close to the Philippines, Palau is an archipelago comprising more than 300 islands, which are distributed over six island groups. The beautiful country in question has a long history of foreign influence, because it has been ruled throughout the centuries by various empires such as Spanish, German, Japanese, and Americans. Palau gained medium independence in 1994 as it entered a Compact of Free Association with the United States, which still remains a formative influence for the current political and economic environment of Palau. Palau has a small population of around 18,000. The country is also famous for its commitment to environmental conservation, especially the marine protected areas. It is considered one of the most favorite destinations for eco-tourism. The cultural heritage of Palau is a mix of Micronesian and Polynesian influences, with both Palauan and English as official languages.Palau follows a very strict matrilineal system, and women are the primary decision-makers. This cultural pattern affects most of the matters in life, such as inheritance, marriage, and funerals, which focus on women.One of the unique Palau cuisines is fruitbat soup-a delicacy made from fruit bats, coconut milk, ginger, and spices. Such a dish has cultural values, and many people in this country enjoy it.Interestingly, Palau is one of the few independent nations that does not have a military. Under the Compact of Free Association with the United States, Palau relies on the U.S. for defense against foreign threats. However, the country maintains a small Maritime Surveillance Unit of 30 personnel who monitor its coastal waters.Tuvalu is a small Polynesian nation situated roughly halfway between Hawaii and Australia. It comprises nine coral atolls scattered across the central Pacific Ocean. While Tuvalu is endowed with an idyllic setting and natural beauty, the low-lying geography makes the country face immense challenges, as its average elevation stands at only three meters above sea level. Tuvalu has approximately 11,000 people and uses fishing, agriculture, and remittances from Tuvaluan citizens working abroad to survive. Being one of the smallest and most isolated nations in the world, it has become a key nation in international debates about climate change and environmental issues. It is also famous for its sense of community, rich Polynesian culture, and its effort to preserve its traditional way of life.Tuvalu is the smallest country in the UN in terms of population. Its estimated population is a mere 11,192 people, ranking 193rd in the world.The country uses the Australian Dollar, which can prove quite challenging to get in Fiji; the only place offering flights to Tuvalu. It has no ATMs as well.Tuvalu has a mean elevation of just two meters, a height that makes it most susceptible to rising sea levels caused by climate change. Coastal erosion is already observed in two of its nine islands.Comoros is an island nation that falls between Madagascar and Mozambique in the Indian Ocean. It has four main volcanic islands: Mayotte, Anjouan, Moheli, and Grand Comore. Comoros is a land with very diverse cultures: African, Arab, and French heritage. This country has an amazing nature: beautiful beaches, verdant forests, and volcanic mountains. Moroni is its capital city and it lies on Grand Comore, which is also the biggest of all these islands. Despite its beauty, Comoros faces a lot of economic challenges and political instability. The nation is mostly an agricultural economy and relies on the production of ylang-ylang for perfume production. Comoros is also one of the least developed countries in the world, facing poverty and unemployment, but its unique geography and rich cultural diversity make it interesting.The origin of the name ""Comoros"" is the Arabic term for ""moon,"" which is pronounced ""qamar."" The moon is also represented on the national flag of Comoros.Comoros was a French colony before gaining independence from France in 1975, with the exception of the island of Mayotte, which remained a French territory.The country's main export partners are France, India, and Germany, and its main import partners are the UAE, France, and China.Among its two islands, Barbuda is one of the territories that make up the independent country of Antigua and Barbuda, which gained its independence from the United Kingdom back in 1981. Being more silent and peaceful compared to Antigua, Barbuda is located to the north. The island is rich in untouched natural beauty because Barbuda is famous for its pure beaches, crystal-clear water, and peaceful atmosphere, creating a hidden gem for travel. The island boasts a population of approximately 1,600 residents who are highly connected to the nation's rich cultural background. In combination, the islands of Antigua and Barbuda present a unique synthesis of history, culture, and tourism that is very lively while Barbuda offers a haven for people looking for the more relaxed experience.Among its prize-winning beaches is the incredible Pink Sand Beach, one of the most beautiful and unique beaches in the world, known for soft, pinkish sand and crystal-clear waters.Codrington Lagoon of the small uninhabited island in Barbuda is Frigatebird Sanctuary. Thousands of frigatebirds find shelter and nest there-they form one of the largest populations of these magnificent birds found in the world.With only about 1,600 people, Barbuda is one of the least populated islands in the Caribbean, giving it a serene and calm atmosphere compared to its busting neighbor, Antigua.","Kiribati is the only country situated in all four hemispheres: northern, southern, eastern, and western.

In another instance, he reportedly gifted the late Queen Elizabeth II a cheeky shower cap emblazoned with the phrase “Ain’t life a b---h.” Kate herself joined the tradition, reportedly presenting Harry with a playful ""grow-your-own-girlfriend"" kit during one festive season.This year, William and Kate, along with their three children—Prince George, 11, Princess Charlotte, 9, and Prince Louis, 6—continued the royal custom of spending Christmas at the Sandringham Estate in Norfolk. Hosting 45 guests, Prince William anticipated a “noisy” celebration, highlighting the warmth and familial chaos that defines their gatherings.However, one absence was notably felt. Reports indicate that Prince Harry, Meghan Markle, and their children, Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet, did not join the festivities at Sandringham.

Who Is Kamel Hawkins: Who is 23-year-old 'maniac' Kamel Hawkins who shoved random man in front of NYC subway train?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-23-year-old-maniac-kamel-hawkins-who-shoved-random-man-in-front-of-nyc-subway-train/articleshow/116858395.cms,"Kamel Hawkins faces attempted murder and assault charges after he allegedly pushed another man onto New York City subway tracks.

What happened to the victim?



'We were told there was a man under the subway'



Kamel Hawkins , a 23-year-old man, was charged with attempted murder after he was seen shoving a complete stranger onto the tracks at the 18th Street station moments before the subway train came. The chilling video of the incident went viral with social media users commenting on how the NYC subway has become a haven for maniacs -- with back-to-back incidents of stabbing, and setting on fire taking place.After pushing a random stranger onto the train track, Hawkins fled the station and was arrested hours later above ground near Columbus Circle.Hawkins has a record of weird behaviors and past crimes including one where he assaulted a cop. In 2019, Hawkins was charged after slamming a cop to the ground on Flushing Avenue when the officer spotted him acting disorderly, leaving the cop with a back injury.Hawkins also has an open case in Brooklyn on assault, harassment and weapons possession charges for an incident. Reports said he was released without bail in another case in 2020 despite prosecutors asking that he be held.Police said Hawkins randomly chose the 45-year-old man to push him into the track and he did not know him beforeThe victim, a 45-year-old man, was taken to Bellview Hospital in critical condition with a head injury and a broken rib. He was not struck by the train but fell on the tracks as the train passed. ""He's alive! He's alive,"" a bystander screamed as firefighters worked to pull the victim from between subway cars.Violet Paley, who was travelling the 1 train when the attack occurred said there was an abrupts stop and an announcement was made to evacuate the train. “All of a sudden there was an abrupt stop and because of everything I’ve been seeing on the news, the first thing that came to my mind was that someone probably got pushed in front of the subway, which is such a dark thought,” she told CNN.“He said we had to evacuate because there was a man under the subway,” Paley said.“They pulled him out, and he was laying there, and I saw his hands and fingers move. I was in so much shock that he was alive. It was unbelievable.”","Kamel Hawkins, 23, faces attempted murder and assault charges after he allegedly pushed another man onto New York City subway tracks.

President Biden: ‘We will get to the truth’

City on high alert

Investigators are now convinced that Shamsud Din Jabbar , the man behind the horrific New Year’s Eve attack in the French Quarter, was not acting alone. Jabbar drove a truck into a crowd on Bourbon Street, killing 15 people before he was fatally shot in a gunfight with police.Special Agent in Charge Alethea Duncan of the FBI revealed that evidence found in Jabbar’s vehicle, including weapons, improvised explosive devices (IEDs), and an ISIS flag , points to a possible network of accomplices. “We do not believe the suspect was solely responsible,” Duncan stated. “We are aggressively pursuing leads about his associates and potential connections to terrorist organizations .”Authorities believe Jabbar’s attack may have been coordinated with others. “Weapons and IEDs discovered in his vehicle suggest this was not a spur-of-the-moment act,” Duncan explained. She also noted that investigators are working to determine how Jabbar acquired the materials and who may have aided him.The FBI is asking the public for help in identifying any associates or suspicious activity linked to Jabbar. “Every piece of information could make a difference,” Duncan said.In the aftermath of the attack, Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry declared a State of Emergency to bolster the investigation and protect public safety. “This declaration allows us to bring every resource to bear in dismantling any threats beyond Jabbar,” Landry announced. The mobilization of the Louisiana National Guard and military police units underscores the severity of the situation.President Joe Biden condemned the attack and affirmed the federal government’s commitment to uncovering the full scope of the incident. “The FBI is leading this investigation as an act of terrorism,” Biden said in a statement. “We will not rest until we understand who else was involved and ensure the safety of every American.”Biden also praised the swift action of local law enforcement and extended condolences to the victims and their families, calling the attack “an unspeakable act of violence.”As New Orleans mourns the loss of life, authorities are intensifying efforts to prevent further attacks. Duncan emphasized the importance of public cooperation, stating, “If you know something, say something. This investigation is far from over.”","Shamsud Din Jabbar drove a truck into a crowd on Bourbon Street, killing 15 people before he was fatally shot in a gunfight with police.

Trump's threat to impose tariffs on countries





US President-elect Donald Trump on Thursday said that tariffs alone were responsible for creating vast wealth in the nation during the Second Industrial Revolution , stressing that tariffs can pay off debt and make America wealthy again. Trump made the statement while referring to a chart shared by American businessman Marc Andreessen on the Truth Social platform, which shows tariffs as a percentage of total federal revenue from 1798 to 2023.Marc Andreessen, sharing the chart, said that the Second Industrial Revolution was perhaps the most fertile era for technology development and deployment in human history. The chart shows data on tariff revenue as a share of total federal receipts from 1798 to 2023. In the chart, the graph shows the highest growth rate between 1870 and 1914, followed by a decline in the subsequent years.""This is a really remarkable chart of tariffs as % of total federal revenue. The Second Industrial Revolution, perhaps the most fertile era for technology development and deployment in human history, was 1870–1914,"" Andreessen wrote in his Truth Social post.Reacting to the chart, Trump said tariffs were responsible for creating wealth for the US during the peak of tariff revenue as a share of federal receipts. He added that the US then shifted to income tax. According to Trump, tariffs can pay off the nation's debt and make America wealthy again.""The Tariffs, and Tariffs alone, created this vast wealth for our Country. Then we switched over to Income Tax. We were never so wealthy as during this period. Tariffs will pay off our debt and MAKE AMERICA WEALTHY AGAIN!"" Trump said in his Truth Social post.Trump previously pledged to reinstate broad tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China as one of his initial executive actions upon taking office on January 26. In a post on his Truth Social platform, he detailed plans for a 25% tariff on all imports from Canada and Mexico and an additional 10% levy on goods from China. He described these measures as essential for addressing illegal immigration and combating the drug trade.The President-elect had also issued threats to BRICS countries regarding tariffs, writing, ""The idea that the BRICS Countries are trying to move away from the Dollar, while we standby and watch is OVER. We require a commitment from these Countries that they will neither create a new BRICS currency, nor back any other currency to replace the mighty US Dollar or, they will face 100% tariffs, and should expect to say goodbye to selling into the wonderful US Economy .""",US President-elect Donald Trump said tariffs alone were responsible for creating vast wealth in the nation during the Second Industrial Revolution.

involved an EV pickup truck and left 10 dead, with an ISIS flag found in the vehicle. Authorities are investigating a potential link between the two incidents but have not confirmed a connection.

Ongoing Investigation

Law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, are working to unravel whether the similarities between the two incidents point to a broader, coordinated threat. For now, the nation watches as investigators dig deeper into the devastating events of Wednesday.

Authorities are investigating a chilling possibility: two violent incidents on the same day, both involving vehicles rented from the car-sharing platform Turo , may be connected.In Las Vegas, a Tesla Cybertruck rented through Turo erupted into flames outside the Trump International Hotel Wednesday morning. The explosion, which left one person dead and seven others injured, is being treated as a possible act of terrorism. A video circulating online shows the Cybertruck engulfed in fire just seconds after stopping near the hotel’s entrance.“We have now confirmed that the explosion was caused by very large fireworks and/or a bomb carried in the bed of the rented Cybertruck and is unrelated to the vehicle itself,” Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in a statement.Elon Musk, who also holds a government role in the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), described the incident as ""unprecedented"" and promised an in-depth investigation.Hours earlier in New Orleans, a suspect identified as Shamsud Din Jabbar drove a Turo-rented EV pickup truck into a crowd of New Year revelers on Bourbon Road, killing 10 people and injuring dozens. Police later found an ISIS flag in the vehicle, sparking fears of a terror link.The FBI has confirmed they are probing whether Jabbar had ties to ISIS or acted alone. “It is still unclear how the suspect obtained the truck,” an FBI spokesperson said, adding that investigations are ongoing.Las Vegas police are examining whether the same rental service used in both cases points to a coordinated plot. However, no concrete link between the two incidents has been established yet.Speaking to reporters, Las Vegas Sheriff Kevin McMahill called the connection “an avenue we are aggressively pursuing.”Turo is a car rental marketplace that allows users to rent cars from ""trusted hosts"" across the United States, Canada, Australia, and France. According to the app’s description on Google Play, it is the ""world's largest car-sharing marketplace,"" offering users an alternative to traditional rental car services.The app touts itself as a way to ""skip the rental car counter"" and choose from an ""extraordinary selection of vehicles shared by local hosts."" It also positions itself as an entrepreneurial opportunity, stating, “Entrepreneurs can take the wheel of their futures by becoming hosts and building car-sharing businesses on Turo.”Galit Ventura Rozen, who was staying in a nearby hotel, described the scene as terrifying. “I looked out the window and saw a huge cloud of smoke rising from the Trump Hotel,” she said. “We didn’t know what was happening, but it felt like something big.”President Joe Biden condemned the violence, saying, “There is no justification for violence of any kind, and we will not tolerate any attack on any of our nation’s communities.” He promised updates as investigations continue.Law enforcement agencies in Nevada and Louisiana are investigating whether the two incidents are connected or coincidental. “We have now confirmed that the explosion was caused by very large fireworks and/or a bomb carried in the bed of the rented Cybertruck,” read a statement from Las Vegas authorities.","Both vehicles involved in the incidents were rented through Turo.

A Tesla Cybertruck explosion and fire outside the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas on Wednesday are being investigated as a possible act of terrorism , according to law enforcement officials.

Surveillance footage reveals the truck passing the Trump Hotel an hour before the explosion, circling back, and stopping in front of the hotel before detonating seconds later.Officials disclosed that the truck contained fireworks, gas tanks, and camping fuel. These items were reportedly connected to a detonation system believed to have been controlled by the driver. The vehicle was rented through the car-sharing platform Turo.Authorities are investigating potential links to an earlier attack in New Orleans, where a rented truck was used to ram into a crowd, killing 10 people and injuring dozens. However, no direct connection has been established between the two incidents.Jeremy Schwartz, acting special agent in charge of the FBI in Las Vegas, confirmed his team is involved in the investigation, saying, “We are treating this as a possible act of terrorism until more evidence is gathered.”Sheriff McMahill acknowledged the heightened concerns due to the location and nature of the incident. “A Cybertruck, the Trump Hotel—there’s lots of questions we have to answer as we move forward,” he said.Tesla CEO Elon Musk addressed the incident on X (formerly Twitter), stating, “We have confirmed that the explosion was caused by very large fireworks and/or a bomb carried in the bed of the rented Cybertruck and is unrelated to the vehicle itself.”Eric Trump, executive vice president of the Trump Organization, expressed gratitude to first responders and emphasized the safety of hotel guests and staff, calling it “our top priority.”Galit Ventura Rozen, a guest at a nearby hotel, described the scene as chaotic. “We saw a huge cloud of smoke … and a line of at least three ambulances and a bunch of police cars,” she said. Guests from the Trump Hotel were later seen gathered in a nearby parking lot.Law enforcement is actively searching for any secondary devices and remains vigilant about potential threats to the community. Sheriff McMahill assured the public that there is no immediate danger but said the investigation is far from over.","A Tesla Cybertruck explosion and fire outside the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas on Wednesday are being investigated as a possible act of terrorism.

Dungeons & Dragons' rule changes involving race and identity divide players,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/dungeons-dragons-rule-changes-involving-race-and-identity-divide-players/articleshow/116867413.cms,"Dungeon Master Jeff Parrish leads a game of Dungeons & Dragons at his home in Goffstown, N.H., on Dec. 3, 2024. The role-playing game replaced ""race"" with ""species"" and divorced several character traits from biological identity. Some longtime players are upset (as is Elon Musk). (Simon Simard/The New York Times)

While solving quests in Dungeons & Dragons, the gamers who role-play as elves, orcs and halflings rely on the abilities and personalities of their custom-made characters, whose innate charisma and strength are as crucial to success as the rolls of 20-sided dice. That is why the game's first significant rule changes in a decade, which became official this fall as it celebrated 50th anniversary, reverberated through the Dungeons & Dragons community and beyond. They prompted praise and disdain at game tables everywhere, along with YouTube harangues and irritated posts from Elon Musk.""Races"" are now ""species"". Some character traits have been divorced from biological identity; a mountain dwarf is no longer inherently brawny and durable, a high elf no longer intelligent and dexterous by definition. And Wizards of the Coast , the Dungeons & Dragons publisher owned by Hasbro, has endorsed a trend throughout role-playing games in which players are empowered to halt the proceedings if they ever feel uncomfortable. ""What they're trying to do here is put up a signal flare, to not only current players but potential future players, that this game is a safe, inclusive, thoughtful and sensitive approach to fantasy storytelling,"" said Ryan Lessard, a writer and frequent Dungeons & Dragons dungeon master.The changes have exposed a rift among D&D players, a group as passionate as its pursuit is esoteric, becoming part of the broader cultural debate about how to balance principles like inclusivity and accessibility with history and tradition. The changes may fit into the corporate world's pursuit of diversity, equity and inclusion, but they are also part of a financial strategy. Players responded tepidly to the fourth edition of D& D in 2008, when the game was more punchline than a blockbuster film premise. ""The Big Bang Theory"" was not yet TV's highest-rated comedy, and the cultural phenomenon of ""Stranger Things,"" whose 1980s characters are fluent in D&D jargon, was years in the future. as we knew the game could be."" Players desired greater leeway in creating characters, Wizards Wizards of the Coast executives said in defence of the new rules. The ""2024 Player's Handbook"" is the fastest-selling publication in company history, it said.Players who are frustrated by the recent revisions argue that the innate characteristics of a species gave the game part of its allure. ""All the species are becoming humans with decorations,"" lamented Devin Cutler, a self-described ""grognard"", or veteran gamer. Cutler acknowledged that the game's orcs - the malevolent, dark-skinned creatures developed by J.R.R. Tolkien - have been associated with negative racial tropes in the real world. But he said their innate traits, however fictional, have accrued authentic meaning over the decades. In reaction to the changes, Musk posted ""How much is Hasbro?"" on X.The popularity of the new rules will ultimately be determined at D&D sessions, where players vote with their feet. John Stavropoulos, a user-experience professional in the healthcare industry, believes the game is headed in the right direction. ""You want the game to be as fun for each other as possible. D&D at its core says, 'Make this game what you want it to be.'""","The game's first significant rule changes in a decade reverberated through the Dungeons & Dragons community.

Rescue officials confirmed the injuries, which resulted from celebratory gunfire during the early hours of January 1, 2025, ARY News reported.The incidents took place in various areas of Karachi, including Liaquatabad, Tariq Road, Shah Faisal, Orangi Town, Gulshan-e-Iqbal, Azizabad, and Korangi.In Liaquatabad, three people were injured by stray bullets.Tariq Road and Shah Faisal reported incidents where two women sustained injuries due to celebratory firing. Orangi Town and Gulshan-e-Iqbal also witnessed two injuries, while Azizabad saw a child being hurt by a stray bullet.Additional cases of aerial firing were reported in other parts of the city. Three individuals in Gulzar-e-Hijri and Korangi No. 6 were injured, while Lyari and Aram Bagh saw three more injured. Other locations, including Agra Taj, Malir Kala Board, Tipu Sultan, Ferozeabad, and Alfalah Dastagir, reported bullet injury cases, adding to the overall toll from the reckless celebratory gunfire.Rescue teams quickly responded to the incidents, transporting the injured individuals to nearby hospitals for treatment, reported ARY News.Authorities are urging the public to exercise caution and avoid dangerous activities like aerial firing during celebrations to prevent harm and ensure the safety of citizens.Earlier, AIG Karachi Javed Alam Odho had issued a stern warning to Karachiites about the dangers of aerial firing, particularly during New Year's Eve. He reminded the public that such reckless actions would lead to serious legal consequences.""The police would register cases under the attempted murder section for aerial firing incidents that occurred on New Year's Eve,"" AIG Odho said.

A Parsi family that knows all about booze in Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/a-parsi-family-that-knows-all-about-booze-in-pakistan/articleshow/116842907.cms,"In 1947, when the British transferred power to India and Pakistan, many businesses also changed hands. One of them was Murree Brewery , among the oldest distilleries in Asia, which was then largely owned by a British family. The Bhandaras of Lahore became its new owners. They were a Parsi family that had thrived in the liquor business.Isphanyar Bhandara now runs Pakistan's top brewery. He recently made a brief halt in New Delhi on his way to Nepal. ""It's my tenth visit to India,"" the businessman-politician said cheerfully, a Pakistan flag lapel pin on his coat the only green in his otherwise blue attire.Liquor business is heavily regulated in the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. About 96% of the country's population is Muslim. The brewery, accordingly, points out on its website, ""Under the country's laws Pakistan Muslims are prohibited from consuming alcoholic drinks. Non-Muslims and foreigners require a consumption permit.""Nonetheless, the business has been rewarding for the Bhandaras. ""The forbidden fruit is always sweet,"" said Isphanyar. ""We make beers from Australian barley. Our vodkas and single malts are also doing very well. It's all about quality. We also make and export fruit juice and are heavily into (bottled) water,"" he added.Success though hasn't been limited to the arena of trade. Isphanyar is also a member of the Pakistan National Assembly . His father was a central minister under Zia-ul-Haq in the 1980s and an MP during the Pervez Musharraf regime.But, as a community, the Parsis have wilted. In 1947, Isphanyar says, about 20,000-25,000 of them lived in Pakistan. Like in India, they played a major role in nation-building, especially in cities like Karachi. They were among the top businessmen and jurists and were engaged in philanthropic work. In the 19th century, Parsis were also among the early cricketers of Karachi. According to an article in scoreline.org, a team of Parsi cricketers toured England in 1886. In 1952, when Pakistan's cricket team toured India, southpaw batter Rusi Dinshaw was part of the squad, although he didn't get to play a Test.""Today, we are less than 1,000,"" says Isphanyar. ""Most of the Parsi population is in its 80s or 90s, a bit like the Japanese. There are very few young Parsis in Pakistan today,"" he said.Many left due to economic reasons, others due to law and order issues. One such migrant was the renowned writer Bapsi Sidhwa, whose novel, Ice Candy Man, was made into a feature film called 'Earth' by director Deepa Mehta. Sidhwa passed away in Houston on Dec 25 last year; she was Isphanyar's aunt.The 54-year-old businessman gets raw material and machinery from India. ""A lot of companies in Pakistan do. The problem is, it is via Dubai,"" he said. But there are other reasons why he wants more trade between the two neighbours.""We can disagree on Kashmir, put it on the back burner. We don't have to concede our position and India doesn't have to concede theirs. But we should keep the baggage of history aside and look at the common good of the common people. We should open the Wagah border,"" he said.More business will benefit the underprivileged, he believes. ""We need it for the common man - dal, roti, cheeni, stuff like that. It will lower the inflation in Pakistan. I've made my presentations to our Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif saab. I'm keeping my fingers crossed,"" he said.Not many know that the brewery - it gets its name from the scenic resort town - was set up in 1860, just three years after the 1857 revolt, to mainly service British troops. Edward Dyer, father of Reginald Dyer, the perpetrator of the 1919 Jallianwala Bagh massacre, was its first manager. By 1890, water shortage and other logistical issues had forced the distillery to shift to the Rawalpindi area, where it continues to be headquartered.There was a time when Murree Beer was sold in India. ""In fact, Pakistan railways had put up tracks inside the brewery that used to carry beer to places like Kabul, Amritsar and, of course, to Karachi port,"" he said. But the state of politics and, consequently, policies, changed in Pakistan in the late 1970s when, exceptions aside, alcohol was banned. But as reputed Dawn columnist Nadeem Paracha wrote in 2013, ""Despite the violence and the eventual prohibition on the (open) sale of alcohol and bars in Pakistan in April 1977, Pakistanis never did stop drinking.""About two decades back, a possible joint venture project proved abortive. ""In 2006, when Vijay Mallya (former chairman of United Spirits) visited Pakistan to watch a cricket match, the prospect of doing something together was broached with my father. But politics did not allow them to come together,"" he said.Political relations between the two countries have further dipped now. But Isphanyar is an optimist. He wants the situation to improve. And more Indo-Pak trade , he insists, is the way to begin.","In 1947, when the British transferred power to India and Pakistan, many businesses also changed hands. The Bhandaras of Lahore became its new owners. They were a Parsi family that had thrived in the liquor business.

The ' Uraan Pakistan ' five-year National Economic Transformation plan is aimed at steering the country towards sustainable growth from macroeconomic stability, the premier said while addressing the launching ceremony here.The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz leader said the government has set an investment target of USD 10 billion annually and an enabling environment is being created to attract local investments as well.Sharif said privatisation and outsourcing are vital to save huge losses for which political dialogue is necessary and for which the private sector will be encouraged""Today is a historic day as we commence the journey of Uraan Pakistan,"" he said, and added that the purpose of the programme is development and it is important that all stakeholders work together.The prime minister credited the public for enduring economic hardships and pledged to build on the current stability, describing it as ""only the beginning"".Sharif also criticised the previous government for straining relations with ""friendly nations"", stating that their conduct left Pakistan isolated on the global stage.He outlined goals for economic reforms, expressing hope that Pakistan's current agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) would be its last.""Through hard work, we can achieve success. Inflation has visibly decreased and the collaboration between the government and institutions continues to strengthen,"" he said.The prime minister stressed on the need for reducing the cost of inputs like electricity and gas to ensure sustainable growth. He said local industries should be made more compatible to save foreign exchange and expand exports, emphasising that export-led growth is the only option to make Pakistan a stronger economy.He also highlighted the coalition government's struggle to stabilise the economy during Pakistan's 2023 financial crisis.""When we were on the brink of default and striving for the IMF programme, we decided to prioritise saving the state over politics,"" he said.Praising the collaboration between government institutions, he said, ""I have never seen such a partnership before. My prayer is for this unity to endure as we move forward with solidarity and determination, learning from past mistakes.""Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said ""Uraan Pakistan"" aims at attaining a sustainable GDP growth rate of six per cent by 2028, one million jobs annually, and ten billion dollars private investment per year.He said this plan is accompanied by a comprehensive implementation mechanism to hit the export target of 60 billion dollars by fiscal year 2028.He added that PM Sharif established a delivery unit at the prime minister's office (PMO) to coordinate the implementation of sectoral plans and roadmaps.""Pakistan recorded a fiscal surplus for the first time in 24 years, reduced inflation from 38 per cent to 5 per cent and improved the policy rate from 13 per cent to 22 per cent. The stock market is now the second-best performing globally, and investor confidence - both local and foreign - has surged,"" he said.Aurangzeb emphasised that the programme is laying the groundwork for sustainable economic growth, adding, ""This is a turning point for the nation's economic stability.""Radio Pakistan reported that Uraan Pakistan is built on pillars of 5Es, entailing exports, e-Pakistan, environment, including food and water security, energy and infrastructure as well as equity, ethics and empowerment.The plan would place Pakistan on a path of sustainable high growth moving towards a stronger and more prosperous future with the commitment to build a solid foundation to transform Pakistan into a trillion dollar economy by 2035 and a three trillion dollar economy by 2047.",Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif unveils national plan for fast-track economic development.

"Pakistan's textile exports face setback, fall short of $17 billion amid political instability",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistans-textile-exports-face-setback-fall-short-of-17-billion-amid-political-instability/articleshow/116833378.cms,"Pakistan's textile industry, which was once poised to achieve higher export earnings, started to lose its momentum, as per The Express Tribune.2024 has been a challenging year for this crucial sector, often referred to as the backbone of the nation's industrial economy.In the fiscal year 2023-24, textile exports saw a modest growth of 0.93 per cent, generating a substantial USD 16.7 billion in export revenues. However, during the first five months of FY25, textile exports reached USD 7.607 billion, reflecting a 10.51 per cent increase compared to the same period last year Express Tribune reported.In the first 11 months of 2024, textile exports totaled just USD 15.43 billion. Industry millers anticipate that the December figure could be approximately USD 1.5 billion, resulting in the year ending with exports falling short of USD 17 billion.Ijaz Khokhar, Patron-in-Chief of the Pakistan-textile-exports, stated, ""The early months of this calendar year were relatively good for the textile industry, particularly exports, as they showed a positive trend.""The positive trend started to decline after the initial months. The primary cause was ongoing political instability, which has persisted for more than two years. Khokhar remarked, ""We have lost at least 40 per cent of our export orders because buyers, hesitant to trust Pakisttextile millers due to political challenges, are shifting their orders to Vietnam.""Others noted that Pakistan also missed the chance to secure orders that were diverted from Bangladesh due to its political turmoil. Waqas Hanif, a mid-sized textile miller from Lahore, said, ""Textile millers in Pakistan should have fully taken advantage of the opportunity created by the political change in Bangladesh. However, our millers have been unable to meet the demand because of price differences.""According to the Express Tribune report a significant portion of the demand was once again redirected to Vietnam, as Pakistani millers lacked product diversification. Hanif highlighted, ""Vietnam is far more advanced in the textile and other sectors. They offer a wide range of products and are able to offer lower prices.""Pakistan was once the top choice for international buyers due to its competitive prices. However, the country has consistently struggled with product diversification. Over the past decade, the government, textile millers, analysts, and foreign buyers have all emphasized the need for diversification.While a few millers are making efforts, the industry as a whole remains far from developing the new products required by European Union and American buyers. The government's support in this area has also been lackluster. Some economists caution that ongoing political tensions, along with stringent measures from the finance ministry and the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), could severely harm the sector, which remains the largest source of export revenue.""The local industry has not been growing for years, so how can we expect product diversification or an increase in export revenue?"" asked Ahmad Aziz Subhani, an economist based in the UAE.Recently, the FBR included the textile sector in the standard tax regime, requiring millers to pay a 2 per cent advance tax instead of the previous 1 per cent. Furthermore, they are now obligated to submit all their business information to the FBR.Subhani stated that following the tax increase, many Pakistani textile companies have been relocating to Dubai. ""So far, about 400 companies have set up offices in Dubai and registered with the Dubai Chamber of Commerce. This will likely lead to under-invoicing of export orders by several Pakistani millers, further reducing export revenue,"" he added.The report further stated that many textile industry leaders highlight that the sector is heading in the wrong direction.""We are struggling with high energy costs, which have led to a reduction in mills and a shift of orders to Vietnam. We are uncertain about how many billions of dollars we've lost because of this,"" said Ashraf Ali, a textile retailer based in Faisalabad. He further mentioned that a cotton crisis is looming, as nearly half of the spinning units have shut down due to a liquidity shortage and delays in the FBR's release of sales tax refunds.""We should expect a rise in yarn prices and a shortage of the product in 2025,"" Ali added. The industry is also awaiting the start of Trump's second term, as many factors depend on the policies the incoming US president will implement.Many millers argue that any restrictions, whether due to political instability or other factors, would have a detrimental impact on Pakistan's textile industry. They also pointed out that the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war and the conflict in the Middle East could further escalate tensions and affect the global economy.In summary, textile exports for the current fiscal year are likely to decline or remain flat due to the various challenges the industry is facing. The sector has almost given up on reaching its USD 25 billion export target, as they believe that without a clear textile policy and the active involvement of key stakeholders in decision-making, achieving this goal would remain an unrealistic aspiration.

Diplomatic efforts amid rising hostilities

What lies ahead?

Tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan have escalated into deadly clashes at the border, leaving at least eight individuals dead and 13 others, including civilians, injured on the Afghan side. The ongoing conflict, which persisted into late Saturday night, comes amidst the growing strain between the two nations, once considered allies.The violence followed an intense exchange of fire, reportedly triggered by Pakistan's targeted airstrikes on alleged camps of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in Afghanistan's eastern Paktika province earlier in the week. Pakistani security officials claim the strikes were a response to a failed infiltration attempt by militants from Afghanistan.According to Pakistani sources, militants attempting to breach the border on Friday night were repelled by Pakistani forces. The following morning, these militants allegedly joined Afghan forces to launch coordinated attacks on Pakistani border posts using light and heavy weapons. The attacks targeted several areas, including Ghozgarhi, Matha Sangar, Kot Ragha, and Tari Mengal.Pakistani forces retaliated, reportedly inflicting significant losses and forcing the attackers to abandon their posts. However, the violence also claimed the life of one Frontier Corps soldier and left 11 others injured.Pakistan has long accused the Afghan Taliban of harboring TTP militants who have intensified attacks on Pakistani security forces in recent months. These attacks, particularly in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan regions, have heightened security concerns in Islamabad.While urging the Afghan government to take decisive action against the TTP, Pakistan said that dialogue between the two nations could not occur amidst ongoing violence.While these diplomatic calls were failing, tensions flared after Pakistan's airstrikes in the Barmal district of Paktika on December 24, which reportedly killed at least 46 individuals, including women and children. The Taliban's ministry of defense condemned the strikes, describing them as an attack on civilians and vowing retaliation.The airstrikes came on the same day a Pakistani delegation led by Special Representative Muhammad Sadiq met Afghan leaders in Kabul in an attempt to resume diplomatic dialogue after a year-long hiatus. However, the Afghan government lodged a formal protest over the airstrikes, accusing Pakistan of targeting civilians rather than militants.The escalating conflict comes against the backdrop of strained relations following the TTP's termination of a ceasefire with Pakistan in November 2022. Since then, attacks by the TTP have claimed the lives of numerous Pakistani soldiers, further deteriorating ties between the neighbors.The renewed border violence, marked by both airstrikes and ground clashes, shows a growing distrust between Kabul and Islamabad. While Pakistan continues to demand action against the TTP, the Afghan Taliban denies harboring militants and accuses Pakistan of targeting civilians under the guise of counterterrorism operations.","Tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan have escalated into deadly clashes at the border.

The airport's original opening date of August 14, 2024, was planned to coincide with Pakistan's Independence Day celebrations but was postponed due to protests organised by the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC).The second delay followed a series of deadly attacks by the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), which targeted key CPEC-related infrastructure, including highways, railway bridges, and mineral transport vehicles, as reported by The Balochistan Post.This latest delay highlights the growing security risks posed by Baloch separatist groups that oppose Chinese investments in the region.The BLA, a major armed group advocating for Baloch independence, has repeatedly targeted Chinese projects and nationals in Pakistan. Notable attacks include a 2018 suicide bombing on a bus carrying Chinese engineers, assaults on the Chinese Consulate in Karachi, and a 2023 attack in Gwadar that killed 13 people, including four Chinese nationals.The BLA has also warned foreign nationals to avoid Balochistan, calling it a ""war zone,"" according to The Balochistan Post.In response to these threats, the Civil Aviation Authority and the Balochistan government have decided to review security arrangements before proceeding with the airport's opening. The BLA's Majeed Brigade has vowed to continue its campaign against Chinese interests, further complicating Pakistan's efforts to maintain stability and attract foreign investment to the region.","The inauguration of the New Gwadar International Airport has been delayed for the third time.

Balochistan: 13-year-old among two missing after detention by Pakistani forces,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/balochistan-13-year-old-among-two-missing-after-detention-by-pakistani-forces/articleshow/116738688.cms,"Two people have reportedly gone missing after being allegedly detained by Pakistan's armed forces in Balochistan , with one case involving a 13-year-old boy. The boy, identified as Balach, son of Sabrullah, is from the Panjgur district, and his family members claimed that he was forcibly taken from his home ten days ago during a raid by Pakistani forces.According to The Balochistan Post, Balach was reportedly subjected to physical abuse before being taken away while still injured.Authorities have yet to comment on the incident, which has sparked concern among local and international human rights organisations.The Pakistani military's repeated targeting of the family has been documented, with previous incidents including a raid on their residence where property was damaged and two hand grenades were thrown outside, though no injuries were reported.According to local sources, the forces have conducted regular raids on the house, subjecting the family to continuous intimidation, as per the report.In another incident, Pakistani forces detained a man identified as Fazal Bashir in the coastal city of Gwadar. Fazal, a resident of Hirabad area in Kech district, was detained on December 23, and his location remains unidentified, according to The Balochistan Post.His family has sought assistance from human rights organisations to determine his whereabouts, worried about his safety. The persistent issue of enforced disappearances in Balochistan continues to draw attention, with local activists and human rights organisations demanding accountability and the release of missing persons.Despite continuous calls for justice, these incidents highlight the ongoing accusations against Pakistani security forces in the region.The families of Balach and Fazal have requested authorities to investigate their cases and provide information about their missing relatives.Balochistan continues to witness systematic abductions and killings, affecting various segments of society including activists, politicians, journalists and civilians, who are reportedly taken by security forces, according to news agency ANI.The Pakistani military faces frequent accusations of using enforced disappearances as a tactic against insurgents and separatist groups. Human rights organisations and Baloch nationalist groups argue that these abductions aim to suppress opposition.These disappearances often lead to torture and extrajudicial killings, intensifying the human rights situation in the region, the report added.","The boy, identified as Balach, is from the Panjgur district of Balochistan.

At least 10 people were killed and hundreds injured during the May 9 riots, while approximately 40 public buildings and military installations were damaged, including the Lahore corps commander’s House (Jinnah House) and Askari Tower in Lahore, the army’s general headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi, Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) office in Faisalabad, the Radio Pakistan building in Peshawar, a toll plaza on the Swat motorway, and a PAF base in Imran’s hometown of Mianwali.Imran and his party have called for a judicial probe into last year’s events, claiming that violence on May 9 was a “false flag” operation aimed at crushing PTI.

Convictions and legal process

May 9 Riots and aftermath

International outcry

Pakistan's response

Pakistan's military courts have sentenced 60 more civilians to prison for their alleged involvement in the violent May 9, 2023, riots that targeted military sites and other facilities following the arrest of former Prime Minister Imran Khan This brings the total number of convictions related to the unrest to 85, according to announcements from the military’s Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).Among those sentenced is Hassan Niazi , Khan’s nephew, who received a 10-year prison term for his alleged role in the attack on the Lahore Corps Commander’s residence, also known as Jinnah House.The ISPR stated that the Field General Court Martial handed down the sentences after reviewing evidence and ensuring due process. “Sequel to the announcement of the May 9 punishments... the Field General Court Martial has promulgated the punishments to the following remaining 60 culprits after examining all evidence, ensuring the provision of all legal rights to the convicts, completion of due process, and the appropriate legal proceedings,” the ISPR announced.The convicted individuals face sentences ranging from two to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment. They have the right to appeal the decisions under Pakistan's Constitution.The unrest on May 9 erupted after Imran Khan’s arrest in a corruption case. Supporters of Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party allegedly attacked key military installations, including the Army General Headquarters in Rawalpindi, the Corps Commander’s House in Lahore, and an ISI office in Faisalabad.In response, authorities detained hundreds of individuals, and 103 were handed over to military courts for trial, sparking widespread criticism of the opaque judicial process.The convictions have drawn sharp rebukes from international entities, including the United States, United Kingdom, and the European Union. Critics argue that the use of military courts to try civilians undermines judicial independence and transparency.“These military courts lack judicial independence, transparency, and due process guarantees,” the US State Department said. Similarly, the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth, and Development Office (FCO) criticized the lack of transparency and independent oversight in the trials, emphasizing the importance of adhering to fair trial standards under international law.The European Union also expressed concern, highlighting that Pakistan’s actions contradict its obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and commitments tied to the GSP+ trade program.The Pakistani government has defended the use of military courts, citing the Supreme Court’s decision that allowed the military to proceed with trials of civilians involved in the riots. The Foreign Office reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to international human rights obligations, asserting that the trials were conducted in accordance with national laws.The ISPR emphasized that the convictions reflect the military’s resolve to uphold justice and maintain the authority of the state, stating, “The Nation, Government, and Armed Forces remain steadfast in their commitment to upholding justice and ensuring that the inviolable writ of the state is maintained.”","Pakistan's military courts have sentenced 60 more civilians to prison for their alleged involvement in the violent May 9, 2023, riots.

Pakistan Airstrikes Afghanistan: Kabul claims Pak airstrikes killed 46 civilians in Afghanistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/kabul-claims-pak-airstrikes-killed-46-civilians-in-afghanistan/articleshow/116661701.cms,"ISLAMABAD: The interim Afghan Taliban govt claimed on Wednesday that 46 people, mostly women and children, were killed in airstrikes by Pakistani fighter jets on civilians in eastern Afghanistan late Tuesday night.Pakistani security officials said the airstrikes took place in Murgha and Laman areas of Barmal district, in Afghanistan’s eastern Paktika province near Pakistan’s volatile South Waziristan tribal district, on alleged camps of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). This has been the fourth time in the past few years that Pakistan has conducted airstrikes inside Afghanistan, and the second time since March 2024.“Last night (Tuesday), Pakistan bombarded four points in Barmal district of Paktika province. The total number of dead is 46, most of whom were children and women,” said Zabihullah Mujahid, spokesperson for the Afghan Taliban govt. He added that six others, mostly children, were wounded.Condemning the airstrikes, the Afghan defence ministry called them “barbaric” and a clear “aggression”. It stated that several refugees, including women and children, were killed and injured. “The Pakistani side should understand that such arbitrary measures are not a solution to any problem,” Enayatullah Khowarazami, spokesperson for Afghanistan’s defence ministry, wrote on social media platform ‘X’. “The Islamic Emirate (Afghan Taliban regime) will not leave this cowardly act unanswered, but rather considers the defence of its territory and sovereignty to be its inalienable right,” he added.The strikes took place hours after Pakistan special representative for Afghanistan Mohammad Sadiq met interim Afghan foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi and interior minister Sirajuddin Haqqani in Kabul, intending to resume diplomatic dialogue after a year-long gap. The deteriorating ties, however, are likely to worsen following Tuesday night’s airstrikes, analysts said.Pakistan alleges the Afghan government harbours armed groups, particularly the TTP, which conducts cross-border assaults against Pakistani security forces. In one of the worst recent assaults on security forces, the TTP had claimed responsibility for the killing of at least 16 Pakistani soldiers in South Waziristan last week.Kabul, however, denies providing shelter to armed groups or allowing their territory to be used for cross-border attacks.Border tensions between the two countries have surged since the Taliban regime took control in 2021, with Pakistan experiencing a revival of militant activity along its western border. Deadly air attacks by Pakistan’s military in Afghan border regions in March, which the Taliban claimed killed eight civilians, had sparked confrontations along the the disputed border between the two countries.","Pakistani security officials said the airstrikes took place in Murgha and Laman areas of Barmal district, in Afghanistan’s eastern Paktika province.

He clarified that military courts only handle cases involving attacks on defence establishments, citing incidents such as the attack on the Corps Commander's House in Lahore.The minister also criticised the PTI for changing its stance regarding trials of civilians in the military courts, recalling that during Khan's tenure, military court trials were praised.""The statements praising the military courts from PTI's leadership are still available on social media. Yet now, the same individuals are lobbying internationally against these courts,"" Tarar said.He assured that military trials adhere to fair trial principles and dismissed claims of injustice in military trials.The military courts tasked to hear cases of suspects involved in the attacks on military facilities on the May 9, 2023 protest last week sentenced 25 civilians to prison terms ranging from 2-10 years.Khan's party criticized the verdicts, arguing that military courts have no jurisdiction over civilians.",Information minister Attaullah Tarar says military courts are competent to deal with cases related to attacks on army facilities.

International and local reactions

Thousands of protesters, led by student activists, marched through Dhaka on Tuesday, calling for the prosecution of ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Demonstrators demanded justice for the deaths of hundreds during a mass uprising that toppled Hasina’s 15-year rule in July.The “March for Unity,” organised by the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement , began at Dhaka’s Central Shaheed Minar.Protesters chanted for Hasina’s trial and urged the banning of her Awami League party. Addressing the rally, movement convener Hasnat Abdullah declared, “Since August 5, we have no more enemies in Bangladesh. Our only enemy is the Awami League.”Hasina fled to India on 5 August following weeks of violent unrest in which security forces were accused of suppressing protests with excessive force. The uprising, which claimed hundreds of lives, ended her tenure as the country’s longest-serving prime minister.Last week, Bangladesh formally requested India to extradite Hasina, who faces numerous charges, including crimes against humanity for the deaths of protesters. A note verbale, a formal diplomatic message, was sent to India on Monday.Bangladesh’s foreign adviser Touhid Hossain confirmed the development, stating, “We sent a note verbal to the Indian government, saying the Bangladesh government wants her back here for judicial process.” India’s Ministry of External Affairs acknowledged receipt of the request but declined further comment.Under the 2013 extradition treaty, amended in 2016, murder charges are excluded from being classified as “political offences.”""Extradition may be refused if the offence for which it is requested is an offence of a political character,"" the treaty states.Bangladesh’s interim government, led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, has committed to prosecuting those responsible for the bloodshed. Yunus has sought international cooperation, including from the International Criminal Court. “We will seek the return of the fallen autocrat Sheikh Hasina from India,” Yunus said.Meanwhile, Hasina’s son, Sajeeb Wazed, has criticised the charges as politically driven. Speaking from the US, he called the accusations a “witch hunt” aimed at undermining his mother’s legacy.","Demonstrators demand justice for the deaths of hundreds during a mass uprising that toppled Hasina’s 15-year rule in July.

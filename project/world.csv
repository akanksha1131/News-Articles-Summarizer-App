Watch: AI brings murder victim to life in Arizona Court as family uses avatar in sentencing hearing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/watch-ai-brings-murder-victim-to-life-in-arizona-court-as-family-uses-avatar-in-sentencing-hearing/articleshow/121014447.cms,"Stacey Wales, sister of the late Christopher Pelkey, displays her brother's image at her mother's home in Chandler, Ariz.

In a landmark moment for the American justice system, the family of Christopher Pelkey used artificial intelligence to allow him to “speak” posthumously at the sentencing of the man convicted of killing him during a 2021 road rage incident in Arizona.Pelkey, a 37-year-old US Army veteran who had served three tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, was fatally shot by Gabriel Paul Horcasitas while both were stopped at a red light in Chandler, Arizona.As per CBS News, Pelkey was walking toward Horcasitas’ car when he was shot in the chest.Last week, Horcasitas was sentenced to 10.5 years in prison for manslaughter.During the sentencing, a nearly four-minute AI-generated video was played in court, showing a digital recreation of Pelkey delivering a victim impact statement The avatar, created using a single photograph and audio from a YouTube video where Pelkey discussed PTSD, greeted the court with a disclaimer: “I am a version of Chris Pelkey recreated through AI that uses my picture and my voice profile.”“It is a shame we encountered each other that day in those circumstances. In another life, we probably could have been friends,” said the AI Pelkey, according to The New York Times. “I believe in forgiveness and in God, who forgives.I always have and I still do”, added the AI avatar.The video, written by Pelkey’s sister Stacey Wales, aimed to reflect his forgiving nature.She was quoted by the BBC saying, “We approached this with ethics and morals because this is a powerful tool... like a hammer, it can build or destroy. We used it to build.”The AI rendering struck a chord with Judge Todd Lang of the Maricopa County Superior Court.“I loved that AI,” he said, as quoted by BBC News. “And as angry as you are, and justifiably angry as the family is, I heard the forgiveness. And I know Mr. Horcasitas appreciated it, but so did I”, Lang added.However, the use of AI in such a personal and emotional court proceeding has raised questions among legal experts. Gary Marchant, a law professor and member of Arizona’s AI committee, was quoted by CBS News as saying that there’s concern that “deepfake evidence” might influence judges and juries. “It’s easy to create, and anyone can do it on a phone,” he warned.Despite these concerns, the AI video was allowed because Arizona law permits victim impact statements in any digital format, explained victims’ rights attorney Jessica Gattuso, as per news agency AP. The video was also supported by nearly 50 letters submitted by family and friends that echoed its message.Horcasitas’ attorney, Jason Lamm, has filed an appeal, suggesting that the judge may have improperly relied on the AI video in sentencing. “However, this may be a situation where they just took it too far,” Lamm was quoted by The New York Times.While the AI avatar was used only in the sentencing phase and not during the trials, of which there were two due to a disclosure error in the first, the incident has prompted broader debate about AI's place in the courtroom.Cynthia Godsoe, a Brooklyn Law School professor, was quoted by The Times as saying that such technology can “inflame emotions more than pictures,” warning courts to tread carefully.But others see potential. As Maura R. Grossman of the American Bar Association’s AI task force noted, “There’s no jury that can be unduly influenced,” and therefore, she did not find it “ethically or legally troubling.”","Christopher Pelkey, a 37-year-old US Army veteran, was fatally shot by Gabriel Paul Horcasitas while both were stopped at a red light in Chandler, Arizona.

"US military begins process to remove up to 1,000 trans personnel under new directive",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-military-begins-process-to-remove-up-to-1000-trans-personnel-under-new-directive/articleshow/121013438.cms,"File photo: US defense secretary Pete Hegseth (Picture credit: AP)





The US department of defense has begun implementing a directive to remove transgender troops from military service, following a green light from the Supreme Court earlier this week.US defense secretary Pete Hegseth issued a memo on Thursday outlining that openly identifying transgender personnel must voluntarily leave the service by June 6, or face forced separation.As per news agency Reuters, the internal instructions give active-duty service members a deadline of June 6 to self-identify, while those in reserve components have until July 7. “On conclusion of the self-identification eligibility window, the Military Departments will initiate involuntary separation processes,” Hegseth said in the memo.The move marks a swift return to US President Donald Trump’s 2017 policy banning transgender individuals from serving openly, which had been overturned by his successor, then-US President Joe Biden, in 2021.Trump had made ending transgender military inclusion a key campaign pledge, and his administration has consistently worked to limit transgender rights. His January 20 executive order declared that the US government would only recognise two immutable biological sexes: male and female.According to news agency AP, about 1,000 transgender troops have already identified themselves since the earlier directive in February, which had been on hold due to court challenges. Those individuals will now “begin the voluntary separation process,” Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell confirmed.Emily Shilling, a Navy commander and one of the plaintiffs who sued to stop the policy was quoted by NBC News as saying, “I know this decision will cause fear and doubt in the ranks... To those feeling shaken, I say this: stand tall. You are not alone.”Hegseth, a former Fox News host known for far-right positions, made his stance clear on social media, writing, “After a SCOTUS victory for @POTUS, TRANS is out at the DOD.”He declared, “No more pronouns, no more climate-change obsessions, no more dudes in dresses. We’re done with that s***,” reported AP.According to the news outlet Rolling Stone, medical records will be used to identify service members diagnosed with gender dysphoria, those under treatment, or showing related symptoms.Troops falling under these categories will not be allowed to enlist or remain in the military unless they meet specific exemption criteria, such as proving support for warfighting activities or showing stability in their birth-assigned sex for 36 months without significant distress.The policy allows only limited waivers. Even with an exemption, service members would still be treated in line with their biological sex for housing, uniforms, and formal address such as ""Sir"" or ""Ma’am"".US department of defense spent approximately $52 million on gender-related medical care, including hormone therapy and surgeries, between 2015 and 2024. There are currently around 4,240 troops diagnosed with gender dysphoria in the active duty, National Guard, and Reserve forces, though advocacy groups estimate the real number is higher.LGBTQ+ advocates condemned the order. Jennifer Levi, a senior director at GLAD Law, was quoted by Reuters as saying, “It is senseless to fast-track people out of the military who are meeting standards and putting lives on the line to defend the country.”While a Gallup poll in February showed 58% of Americans still support allowing transgender individuals to serve, that number has dropped significantly from 71% in 2019.","US defense secretary Pete Hegseth issued a memo on Thursday outlining that openly identifying transgender personnel must voluntarily leave the service by June 6, or face forced separation.

North Korea says leader Kim supervised missile tests simulating nuclear strikes against rivals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/north-korea-says-leader-kim-supervised-missile-tests-simulating-nuclear-strikes-against-rivals/articleshow/121014196.cms,"AP file photo





SEOUL: North Korean leader Kim Jong Un supervised tests of short-range ballistic missile systems that simulated nuclear counterstrikes against US and South Korean forces, state media said Friday, as the North continued to blame its rivals for escalating tensions through their joint military exercises.The report came a day after South Korea's military detected multiple launches from North Korea 's eastern coast and assessed that the tests could also be related to the country's weapons exports to Russia during its war in Ukraine.North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency said Thursday's tests involved a mobile ballistic missile system apparently modeled after Russia's Iskander, as well as 600-millimeter multiple rocket launchers that South Korean officials classify as ballistic due to their self-propulsion and guided flight.Both are part of a growing lineup of weapons systems that the North says could be armed with ""tactical"" nuclear weapons for battlefield use.KCNA said the tests were intended to train military units operating missile and rocket systems to more effectively execute attacks under the North's nuclear weapons control system and ensure a swift response to a nuclear crisis.The agency criticized the United States and its ""vassal states"" for expanding joint military exercises on and around the Korean Peninsula, which the North claims are preparations for nuclear war, and said Thursday's launches demonstrated the ""rapid counteraction posture"" of its forces.Kim stressed the need to strengthen the role of his nuclear forces in both deterring and fighting war, and called for continued efforts to improve combat readiness and precision strike capabilities, KCNA said.South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said multiple missiles of various types were launched from the area around the eastern port city of Wonsan on Thursday from about 8:10 to 9:20 a.m., with the farthest traveling about 800 kilometers (497 miles).Lee Sung Joon, spokesperson for the Joint Chiefs, said in a briefing the North Korean launches were possibly intended to test the performance of weapons it plans to export, as the country continues to send military equipment and troops to fuel Russia's warfighting against Ukraine.Japanese defence minister Gen Nakatani told reporters that none of the North Korean missiles reached Japan's exclusive economic zone and there was no damage to vessels or aircraft in the area.It was the North's first known ballistic activity since March 10, when it fired several ballistic missiles hours after US and South Korean troops began an annual combined military exercise, and the country's sixth launch event of the year.Tensions on the Korean Peninsula have escalated in recent months as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un continues to accelerate the development of his nuclear and missile program and supply weapons and troops to support Russia's war against Ukraine.Thursday's launch came a day after North Korean state media said Kim urged munition workers to boost the production of artillery shells amid his deepening alignment with Moscow.","North Korean leader Kim Jong Un supervised tests of short-range ballistic missile systems.

US president slams Fed chief for not cutting rates,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-president-slams-fed-chief-for-not-cutting-rates/articleshow/121014253.cms,"This is a Reuters story





US President Trump renewed his criticism on Thursday of Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell , complaining the Fed is refusing to lower interest rates Trump said cutting interest rates would be “like jet fuel” for the economy “but he doesn’t want to do it”. He said Powell is “not in love with me”. Fed this week kept short-term borrowing costs in the 4.25%-4.50% range, where they have been since Dec. While big tariffs are likely to increase inflation and unemployment, the economy so far has shown little sign of either, Powell said, giving the central bank time to wait and see until there is more clarity on where tariffs actually end up, and how that affects prices and jobs. Fed can then act as needed, and potentially aggressively, he said. Trump has made no secret of his dissatisfaction with Powell’s conduct, even suggesting he would like him gone.

Former US President Joe Biden has said he takes some responsibility for Donald Trump’s election win in 2024 but strongly defended his time in office, blaming a lack of messaging and Republican obstruction for voter dissatisfaction.In an interview on ‘The View’, Biden said, “Yes, I do,” when asked if he bore any responsibility for the Democrats’ defeat. “Because look, I was in charge, and he won, so I take responsibility.”However, he also claimed that if he had stayed in the race, he could have beaten Trump, a view he’s expressed before.Biden added he was not surprised that former Vice President Kamala Harris lost, saying her opponents “went the sexist route,” while also citing the “phenomenal negative impact” of the Covid-19 pandemic.Still, he called Harris “first rate” and said she faces a “difficult decision” about her political future. “I hope she stays fully engaged,” he said, but noted, “We have a lot of really good candidates as well.”Biden exited the race after a widely criticised debate performance against Trump, which raised fresh concerns about his age. He admitted the debate was a “bad, bad night” but denied it reflected a deeper cognitive decline.“There’s nothing to sustain that,” he said, adding he “did a pretty damn good job the last six months” in office.Dr Jill Biden also appeared in the interview and gave a firm defence of her husband’s capabilities. “He’d get up, put in a full day, and then at night... he was still on the phone, reading his briefings, working with staff. I mean, it was nonstop,” she said.Biden rejected suggestions that he pressured Harris not to publicly distance herself from his administration. As per CBS News, he “did not advise her” to say there were no differences between their policies and added that her remarks had been “misinterpreted.”The former president also took aim at Trump, accusing him of having “the worst 100 days any president’s ever had.” When asked why Trump keeps mentioning him, Biden replied, “I beat him,” referencing his 2020 victory.Biden dismissed Trump’s claim that pardons signed with an autopen, including for family members, were “void,” responding sharply: “Oh, he’s vacant.”The interview comes as both Bidens reemerge in public life. Jill Biden now leads a women’s health initiative, while the former president is working on a new book and exploring how best to stay involved. “I’m trying to figure out what’s the most significant and consequential role I can play,” he said.","Former US President Joe Biden said he takes some responsibility for Donald Trump's election win in 2024.

Trump names Fox News host Jeanine Pirro as interim top federal prosecutor in Washington after dropping Ed Martin,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-names-fox-news-host-jeanine-pirro-as-interim-top-federal-prosecutor-in-washington-after-dropping-ed-martin/articleshow/121010740.cms,"AP file p

.





US president Donald Trump on Thursday named Fox News host Jeanine Pirro as the interim top federal prosecutor for Washington, D.C., replacing his original pick, Ed Martin Jr., whose nomination faced heavy opposition.The announcement was made on Trump’s Truth Social account, where he praised Pirro as “incredibly well qualified” and “one of the top district attorneys” in New York’s history.Pirro, a former judge and three-term district attorney in Westchester County, New York, joined Fox News in 2006 and now co-hosts ""The Five."" Her appointment follows a pattern of Trump tapping Fox News figures for senior posts — including Pete Hegseth, now Defence Secretary.Trump pulled Martin’s nomination earlier in the day after Republican senators raised concerns about his defence of Capitol rioters and lack of legal experience. Martin, who had never prosecuted a case before, drew criticism during his brief tenure for controversial staff changes and social media posts.Pirro’s legal background stands in contrast. A 1975 Albany Law School graduate, she helped establish one of the country’s first domestic violence prosecution units. She also ran unsuccessfully for New York attorney general in 2006 after briefly attempting to challenge then-Senator Hillary Clinton.While Pirro's media career has included public support for Trump, it has also brought legal trouble. In 2021, she was named in a $2.7 billion defamation suit by Smartmatic for spreading false claims about the 2020 election.","Jeanine Pirro is a former judge and three-term district attorney in Westchester County, New York.

‘Lying for a 20-second donation hit’: Kash Patel clashes with Madeline Dean over 'FBI weaponisation',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/lying-for-a-20-second-donation-hit-kash-patel-clashes-with-madeline-dean-over-fbi-weaponisation/articleshow/120982391.cms,"



FBI Director Kash Patel and Democratic Rep. Madeline Dean clashed during a heated House subcommittee hearing , with Patel accusing Dean of misrepresenting facts and Dean charging that the FBI under Patel had been weaponised to pursue political enemies Dean, who served as an impeachment manager during President Trump’s second impeachment trial, launched a pointed line of questioning at Patel. “As you and the president continue to weaponise and investigate his perceived enemies... when can I, a former impeachment manager, expect the FBI at my door?” she asked.Patel shot back, “Ma’am. You want to know who was targeted by a weaponised FBI? Me. You want to know how and why? You want to know what I'm doing to fix it?”As Dean attempted to move on, Patel continued, “You should read the book, because there's no enemies list in that book. There are people that violated their constitutional obligations and their duties to the American people, and they were rightly called out. And you should give that book to every one of your constituents so they can read about it.”Dean then accused Patel of dishonesty during his Senate confirmation hearings, referring to his denial of involvement in the firing of FBI officials after the January 6 riot and his repeated appearances on the podcast of Stu Peters, whom she labelled “an anti-Semitic Holocaust denier”.She asked, “Should we worry more about your memory or your veracity?”Patel hit back strongly. “We should worry more about your lack of candour. You're accusing me of committing perjury. Tell the American people how I broke the law and committed a felony. Have the audacity to actually put the facts forward instead of lying for political banter so you can have a 20 second donation hit.”He added, “The answer is both. I believe that the answer is you're failing. Not me.”Dean insisted the FBI’s rank-and-file deserved better. “I believe that the members of the FBI... deserve the very best, deserve extraordinary independence, deserve freedom from the fears of being investigated.”The tense exchange came as Patel also faced criticism over a proposed $500 million cut to the FBI's 2026 budget, backed by the Trump White House. Though the administration framed the cuts as a move to “streamline” the bureau, Patel warned such reductions would harm the agency’s capacity to tackle violent crime.“We need more than what has been proposed,” he told lawmakers, adding that the FBI was working on relocating 1,000 staff to areas most affected by violent crime. “We’ve taken a process... and said, ‘Where are some of the most violent crime places in America?’”When pressed on which positions would be cut if the funding decrease goes ahead, Patel responded, “At this time, we have not looked at who to cut. We are focusing our energies on how not to have them cut.”","FBI Director Kash Patel and Democratic Rep. Madeline Dean clashed during a heated House subcommittee hearing.

Yes, I agree with her. No, I disagree with her.

Megyn Kelly Declares ""The Met Gala is Dead"" and Calls Out Obscene Nudity and ""Rosa Parks on Crotch""





Megyn Kelly launched into a furious tirade against the 2025 Met Gala, slamming the prestigious fashion event as a “wannabe version of its old self” and accusing organisers of pandering to Black Americans with an “incomprehensible” theme.Speaking on Tuesday’s episode of The Megyn Kelly Show, the former Fox News anchor took aim at the gala’s theme “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,” which celebrated Black dandyism and its influence on fashion. Kelly ridiculed the concept as elitist and politically driven, dismissing it as “leftist academic, gobbledygook, nonsensical talk.”“Once the apex of high fashion culture and A-list celebrity, the gala now looks more like a sad sack D-list past-its-prime wannabe version of its old self,” she said.“It’s closer to today’s Nerd Prom White House Correspondents Dinner than the centre of the celeb and beauty universe as it used to be.”Kelly openly mocked the theme’s intellectual basis, referencing Monica Miller’s 2009 book Slaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity, which inspired the Met exhibit. “So far we have dandyism, intersection and diasporic identity,” Kelly said. “We’re batting a thousand on the scale of leftist code language that will make liberals sound smarter and feel superior.”She went on to quote Miller’s description of Black dandyism, before blasting it as purposefully obtuse: “The whole point is to lose you and sound smarter than you by saying words that are totally empty and meaningless,” she said.Kelly accused the event of virtue-signalling, saying the gala’s true intent was to “pander to Black people because we love Black people and that makes us good people.” She described the night as “basically Black Lives Matter at the Met,” calling it “a parade of Black Americans, leftists in their dandy style.”“Near as I can figure,” she added, “it appears to mean over-the-top black and white with weird shapes and vaginas showing.”The annual Met Gala, co-chaired this year by stars like Colman Domingo, Pharrell Williams and Lewis Hamilton, was otherwise hailed by fashion critics for celebrating the elegance and defiance of Black style throughout history. But Kelly dismissed the celebration entirely, describing it as a self-congratulatory gathering of elites.“You’re not meant to understand this,” she concluded. “You dumbasses. You have to go to Harvard to understand what these people are saying, how they speak and how they code talk.”The Met Gala reportedly raised $31 million this year.",Megyn Kelly slammed the 2025 Met Gala as a ‘wannabe version of its old self’ Accused organisers of pandering to Black Americans with an ‘incomprehensible’ theme.

NEW DELHI: Amid the threat of an all-out war between India and Pakistan, US secretary of state Marco Rubio dialled his counterpart S Jaishankar and Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif , seeking immediate de-escalation and expressing support for direct dialogue between the two countries.While the US readouts of the two conversations said Rubio encouraged continued efforts to improve communications, Jaishankar later on X said he told Rubio that India will firmly counter any escalation by Pakistan.In the case of Shehbaz, while he expressed sorrow for the reported loss of ""civilian lives in the current conflict"", Rubio reiterated his calls for Pakistan to take concrete steps to end any support for terrorist groups . Pakistan has accused India of killing civilians but India has maintained that its May 7 strikes were targeted only at terrorists and their infrastructure, not civilians.In the case of India, he reiterated his condolences for the terrorist attack in Pahalgam and reaffirmed the US's commitment to work with India in the fight against terrorism . Appreciating the US support on terrorism, Jaishankar told Rubio that India will firmly counter any attempts at escalation by Pakistan, underlining India's measured response to cross-border terrorism. The conversation took place in the middle of fresh clashes between India and Pakistan late on Thursday that sparked fears of a major escalation.Jaishankar also spoke to his EU and Italy counterparts late evening, as tensions soared.Jaishankar also told his visiting Iranian counterpart, Abbas Araqchi, that it's not India's intention to escalate, but if there's any military attack on India, it will be met with a ""very, very firm response"". Jaishankar also met Saudi Arabia junior foreign minister Adel Aljubeir and, as he said in a post on X, shared India's perspective on firmly countering terrorism.While the Iranian minister was in India on a pre-arranged visit for the regular India-Iran joint commission meeting, Aljubeir arrived here for an unannounced visit. Both countries have been in touch with top Indian and Pakistani leadership, looking to defuse tensions.Araqchi and Aljubeir both urged restraint and de-escalation. ""We hope that India and Pakistan will prevent the escalation of tension in the region. Our region needs peace, especially to expand economic cooperation between regional countries, and we hope this will happen,"" said Araqchi.The EU also strongly urged de-escalation, while condemning terrorism. Every state has the duty and the right lawfully to protect its citizens from acts of terror, said the EU in a statement. ""The EU calls on both parties to exercise restraint, to de-escalate tensions and desist from further attacks to safeguard civilian lives on both sides. The EU urges both sides to engage in dialogue. It is vital that India and Pakistan also live up to their obligations under international law and take all measures possible to protect civilian lives,"" said the statement.Amid global calls for restraint, foreign secretary Vikram Misri said there has been a recognition among the international community of the fact that the Pahalgam attack was of barbaric nature, and of India's right to respond to it. ""There is also a recognition of the fact that in responding, we have been nothing but responsible and have done so in a restrained, measured, and non-escalatory manner.

White House proposes overhauling the outdated US air traffic control system in the wake of crashes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/white-house-proposes-overhauling-the-outdated-us-air-traffic-control-system-in-the-wake-of-crashes/articleshow/121010553.cms,"AP file photo





The Trump administration proposed a multibillion-dollar overhaul of the U.S. air traffic control system on Thursday in the wake of recent deadly plane crashes and technical failures that have put a spotlight on the outdated network.The plan calls for six new air traffic control centers, along with technology and communications upgrades at all of the nation's air traffic facilities over the next three years, said Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy. How much it will all cost wasn't immediately revealed.""We use radar from the 1970s,"" said Duffy, who compared the proposal with upgrading from a flip phone to a smartphone. ""This technology is 50 years old that our controllers use to scan the skies and keep airplanes separated from one another.""The Trump administration wants to add fiber, wireless and satellite technology at more than 4,600 locations, replace 600 radars and increase the number of airports with systems designed to reduce near misses on runways.Six new air traffic control centers also would be built under the plan and new hardware and software would be standardized across all air traffic facilities.The plan has an aggressive timeline, calling on everything to be finished by 2028.The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee estimated last week that it might cost $12.5 billion to overhaul the air traffic control system, but that estimate was developed before the Transportation Department revealed the details of its plan. Backers of the proposal indicated the amount was just a first step.U.S. Rep. Sam Graves of Missouri, who heads the House transportation committee, called it only a ""down payment.""To build the system in three to four years, as planned, Duffy said Congress must give the Federal Aviation Administration all the money up front.Trump said Thursday that the plan will revolutionize flying. ""The new equipment is unbelievable what it does,"" he said from the Oval Office. He began to say it may even alleviate the need for pilots before adding, ""In my opinion, you always need pilots. But you wouldn't even have to have pilots. This system is so incredible.""The aging system and its struggles to handle more than 45,000 daily flights have come under renewed scrutiny since the midair collision in January between a military helicopter and a commercial airliner that killed 67 people over Washington, D.C.The crash showed the need for these upgrades, Duffy said in front of airline officials, union leaders and family members of those who died in the crash near Reagan National Airport. ""If there are foreseeable issues in the airspace you would expect someone to take actions to save lives,"" Duffy said.""This is bold. This is going to be challenging, but we absolutely can do it,"" he said.Some of the equipment is so dated that the government shops on eBay for replacement parts and some systems still use floppy disks, Duffy said.Following the midair crash, Trump promised to fix what he called ""an old, broken system"" and to tackle the nationwide shortage of air traffic controllers while blaming the previous Biden administration for both problems.But the weaknesses within the air traffic control system have been highlighted for years in hearings before Congress and government reports. The struggles to keep up with increasing air traffic has been recognized since the 1990s - long before either Trump or Biden took office.The Trump administration's overhaul plan will need backing from Congress and enough funding to be more effective than previous reform efforts during the last three decades. Already more than $14 billion has been invested in upgrades since 2003 but none have dramatically changed how the system works.The Federal Aviation Administration has been working since the mid-2000s to make upgrades through its NextGen program.One of the biggest challenges with a massive upgrade is that the FAA must keep the current system operating while developing a new system and then find a way to seamlessly switch over. That's partly why the agency has pursued more gradual improvements in the past.The shortage of controllers and technical breakdowns came to the forefront in recent weeks when a radar system briefly failed at the Newark, New Jersey, airport, leading to a wave of flight cancellations and delays.Without the planned upgrades announced Thursday, those breakdowns will be repeated around the nation, Duffy said. ""Newark has been a prime example of what happens when this old equipment goes down,"" he said.","The plan calls for six new air traffic control centers, along with technology and communications upgrades at all of the nation's air traffic facilities.

Pentagon on Thursday announced it will start removing openly transgender service members from the US military, following the supreme court’s recent decision allowing enforcement of the Trump administration ’s long-pending ban.Defence secretary Pete Hegseth issued the directive within hours of the ruling, saying that roughly 1,000 transgender personnel who have publicly identified will now be moved out of service. Others have 30 days to self-report before the department begins examining medical records to identify additional cases.In a social media post after the decision, Hegseth wrote “No more trans at DoD,” reinforcing his earlier remarks at a special operations conference in Florida, where he said the military was abandoning “wokeness and weakness.”He also told the audience, “No more pronouns,” in reference to gender identity practices within the forces.According to Pentagon data, 4,240 active duty, national guard, and reserve troops had been diagnosed with gender dysphoria as of December 2024. However, officials acknowledge that the actual number may be higher, given that not all individuals have come forward or received formal diagnoses.The new policy mirrors one introduced in February but halted due to ongoing litigation.

The Trump administration's latest trade deal with Britain unfairly penalizes US automakers that have partnered with Canada and Mexico, a trade group representing Detroit automakers said Thursday.In a sharply-worded statement, the American Automotive Policy Council (AAPC) said the US-UK trade deal ""hurts American automakers, suppliers, and auto workers,"" according to the group's president Matt Blunt.The deal unveiled Thursday between US President Donald Trump and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer lowers the tariff on British vehicles to 10 percent from 27.5 percent on the first 100,000 cars shipped from Britain to the United States.In contrast, AAPC members Ford , General Motors Company and Jeep-maker Stellantis now face import tariffs of 25 percent on autos assembled in Canada and Mexico.The Detroit companies organized their supply chains around the 2020 US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which Trump negotiated in his first term.""We are disappointed that the administration prioritized the UK ahead of our North American partners,"" Blunt said. ""Under this deal, it will now be cheaper to import a UK vehicle with very little US content than a USMCA compliant vehicle from Mexico or Canada that is half American parts.""Trump last week unveiled some steps to lessen the impact of tariffs on imported auto parts in moves applauded by GM and Ford.The Trump administration will allow companies that assemble autos in the United States to deduct a fraction of the cost of imported parts for two years to give the industry enough time to relocate supply chains.In another change, the administration said companies wouldn't face a 25 percent levy on imported steel or aluminum in addition to a 25 percent levy for an imported vehicle.But last weeks' changes did not soften the 25 percent tariff on imported finished autos.The Trump administration plans to negotiate separate agreements with Japan, South Korea and the European Union, all of which export finished autos to the United States.""We hope this preferential access for UK vehicles over North American ones does not set a precedent for future negotiations with Asian and European competitors,"" Blunt said.","The American Automotive Policy Council says the US-UK trade deal ""hurts American automakers, suppliers, and auto workers"" The deal lowers the tariff on British vehicles to 10 percent from 27.5 percent on the first 100,000 cars shipped from Britain to the United States.

US president Donald Trump on Thursday confirmed a trade framework with the United Kingdom that reduces tariffs on autos and metals while keeping the baseline 10% tariff as it is. The announcement followed a phone call with UK prime minister Keir Starmer Under the plan, US tariffs on British cars will drop from 27.5% to 10% for a quota of 100,000 vehicles. Tariffs on steel and aluminium will be removed. In return, the UK will increase purchases of US agricultural goods, simplify customs for American products, and cut import taxes on around 2,500 items, including olive oil, wine, and sports equipment.The Republican president indicated that other countries negotiating trade deals with the US could face steeper import taxes.Referring to the UK’s 10% tariff rate, Trump said, “That’s a low number,” and argued that nations with which the US runs trade deficits—and which he claimed had treated the US unfairly—would be subject to higher tariffs.US stocks meanwhile surged Thursday as investor optimism grew following the announcement of the trade deal between the United States and the United Kingdom that could ease recession fears by lowering select tariffs and restrictions.Earlier, during simultaneous press conferences in London and Washington, Keir Starmer appeared via video link from the White House alongside Donald Trump, calling the US-UK trade agreement “a truly fantastic and historic day.”","US president Donald Trump confirmed a trade framework with the United Kingdom that reduces tariffs on autos and metals.

But for this to happen, Russia must show that it is serious about ending the war, starting with a full and unconditional ceasefire,” he posted on social media.The conversation between the two leaders came just as the Kremlin initiated a symbolic three-day ceasefire to mark Russia’s Victory Day. Starting at midnight on Thursday, the pause is meant to honour the 80th anniversary of the country’s World War II win. But Ukraine swiftly rejected the gesture, labelling it insincere.Kyiv officials have argued that Russia has broken similar agreements in the past.

NEW DELHI: A sustained escalation in tension with India could hurt Pakistan's growth, impact its fiscal consolidation and macroeconomic stability, Moody's Rating warned on Monday. In contrast, it does not expect a significant impact on India, apart from higher defence spending weighing on govt's fiscal consolidation plan.Pakistan was on the brink of bankruptcy until the International Monetary Fund bailed it out once again, provided it met several conditions. Its credit rating, Caa2+ according to Moody's, is speculative grade, signalling its weak fundamentals.""Pakistan's macroeconomic conditions have been improving, with growth gradually rising, inflation declining and foreign-exchange reserves increasing, amid continued progress in the IMF programme. A persistent increase in tensions could also impair Pakistan's access to external financing and pressure its foreign-exchange reserves, which remain well below what is required to meet its external debt payment needs for the next few years,"" Moody's said.Apart from assistance from multilateral agencies, including IMF and the World Bank, Pakistan had also managed to roll over debt from Saudi Arabia, China and UAE to tide over the foreign exchange and debt crisis.The weak sentiments are also reflected in stock market indices. Pakistan's benchmark KSE-100 index fell another 635 points on May 5. Since April 23, the index has lost over 7,500 points, or 6% due to fears of a conflict.Indian markets have, however, held up. ""Comparatively, the macroeconomic conditions in India would be stable, bolstered by moderating but still high levels of growth, amid strong public investment and healthy private consumption. In a scenario of sustained escalation in localised tensions, we do not expect major disruptions to India's economic activity because it has minimal economic relations with Pakistan (less than 0.5% of India's total exports in 2024),"" Moody's said.Moody's is not budgeting for a broad-based military conflict. ""Our geopolitical risk assessment for Pakistan and India accounts for persistent tensions, which have, at times, led to limited military responses.

DHAKA : The interim govt, headed by Muhammad Yunus , is set to finalise an ordinance within a week that will abolish nine controversial provisions of the cyber security act-2023, including one related to the liberation war and father of the nation, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman One of the provisions abolished during the drafting of the new ordinance is punishment for carrying out any “hateful, misleading or defamatory propaganda” against the liberation war, the spirit of the liberation war, Mujibur Rahman, the national anthem, or the national flag.” Law adviser Asif Nazrul said this provision had often been misused in the past to “harass” people.At a meeting held Tuesday, the council of advisers approved the draft of the new ordinance, titled ‘Cyber Surokkha Adhyadesh-2025 (cyber protection ordinance-2025), fulfilling the interim govt’s promise to repeal the cyber security act-2023. Once vetted by the law ministry, the ordinance is expected to be formally gazetted and enforced within a week.Nazrul said the nine abolished provisions had accounted for 95 per cent of all cases previously filed under the 2023 act.These cases will be automatically cancelled once the new ordinance comes into effect. “When we first took office, we pledged to repeal the previous cyber security act and replace it with amodern law,” he said.For the first time, internet access will be officially recognized as a civil right in Bangladesh.

Who is Chinmoy Krishna Das?

A Bangladesh court on Wednesday granted bail to former Iskcon leader Chinmoy Krishna Das in a sedition case , reported Bangladesh's The Daily Star.Das was arrested following a controversy that erupted when a sedition case was filed against him and 18 others in Chittagong on October 30 last year.The charges were linked to the hoisting of a saffron flag above Bangladesh's official flag during the October 25 rally at Laldighi Maidan in Chattogram.Das was presented before a Chittagong court on Tuesday, where his bail plea was denied, and he was sent into custody. The arrest has triggered widespread outrage, with many demanding his immediate release.Das serves as the spokesperson for the Bangladesh Sammilita Sanatani Jagran Jote , a group that champions the rights and security of minorities. He has been a vocal advocate for the Hindu (Sanatani) community in Bangladesh, calling for key reforms such as a minority protection law, a tribunal for fast-tracking cases of minority persecution, and the establishment of a dedicated ministry of minority affairs.He gained widespread attention for organising large public rallies, including one in Chittagong on October 25 and another in Rangpur on November 22, which sparked significant socio-political discussions across the country.Das hails from Satkania Upazila in Chittagong. From 2016 to 2022, he was the Chittagong divisional secretary of Iskcon. He gained popularity at an early age for his religious speeches and earned the nickname of ‘Shishu Bokta’, or ‘child orator’, reports Bangladeshi media.",Chinmoy Krishna Das is a former Iskcon leader.

Bangladesh Currency Crisis: Bangladesh faces currency crisis as central bank halts issuing notes featuring Mujibur Rahman,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-faces-currency-crisis-as-central-bank-halts-issuing-notes-featuring-mujibur-rahman/articleshow/120714882.cms,"Approximately Taka 15,000 crore worth of notes remain unused

DHAKA: The central bank of Bangladesh has apparently incurred a huge financial loss due to the interim govt’s decision not to issue previously printed notes, with approximately Taka 15,000 crore worth of paper notes featuring the image of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman remaining unused. The decision aligns with govt’s efforts to diminish Bangabandhu’s presence in public memory.Although bank officials are unwilling to discuss the matter publicly, many, on conditions of anonymity, said the longstanding tradition of obtaining new notes from Bangladesh Bank has been abruptly halted, creating a crisis in the market. On the one hand, the printed money is being wasted without use; on the other hand, customers are suffering as a result, they added.“Notes of various denominations are printed using paper and ink purchased with people’s taxes. Millions of notes with Bangabandhu’s picture are still lying in the vaults of various banks. The Security Printing Corporation does not have the capacity to cancel all the notes at once and print new ones. Therefore, notes with Bangabandhu’s picture cann’t be suddenly cancelled,” Ziauddin Ahmed, former executive director of Bangladesh Bank and former managing director of Security Printing Corporation, told reporters.In this situation, he suggested the printed notes be circulated in the market to alleviate public suffering. “When new design notes come into the market, the old ones should be gradually withdrawn. Generally, notes printed once can be used for a maximum of four to five years,” Ahmed said.According to media reports, Bangladesh Bank is unable to issue new notes to banks in line with demand. The crisis became evident following the country’s political upheaval in Aug last year.Since all forms of currency, including metal coins, feature Mujibur’s image, Bangladesh Bank abruptly stopped issuing new notes early April. As a result, the notes featuring Bangabandhu’s image are not reaching the market. Shops, banks, and citizens are now left with torn and old, dirty notes.According to sources at Bangladesh Bank, the Security Printing Corporation is set to begin printing new design notes next month. In the first phase, new design notes of 20, 50, and 1,000 taka will be printed and subsequently released in the market through banks.","Taka 15,000 crore worth of paper notes featuring the image of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman remain unused.

Poll Should the Bank of England adopt a more proactive approach to monetary policy? Yes, absolutely No, they should be cautious





LONDON: The Bank of England is widely expected to look past near-term inflationary pressures in the British economy and opt to cut interest rates on Thursday as a result of the potential shock to growth emanating from the tariff policies of the Trump administration.Most economists believe it's a near-certainty that the nine-member monetary policy committee will sanction a quarter-point reduction in the bank's main interest rate, to 4.25%. The decision is to be announced at 12:02 p.m., two minutes later than usual as a result of the two-minute silence for Victory in Europe Day. There's some speculation that some members may opt for an even bigger half-point cut.Economists are going to be particularly interested in the bank's accompanying economic forecasts as they will be the first since US President Donald Trump made his tariff announcement in early April. Though most tariffs were paused for 90 days following the ensuing market turmoil, including the 10% baseline tariff applied to UK goods entering the United States, the backdrop for the global economy remains highly uncertain.""With US trade policy presenting a new demand shock, there have been early signs that the MPC is willing to adopt a more proactive approach to loosening policy,"" said Edward Allenby, UK economist at Oxford Economics.The forecasts, particularly those regarding growth and inflation, will provide a steer as to whether a more proactive approach is likely. Since it started cutting interest rates in August 2024 from the 16-year high of 5.25%, the MPC has been consistent in lowering borrowing costs every three months.The imposition of US tariffs on British goods, and the potential for a wider global trade war, has the potential to weigh on growth as well as oil prices, which would consequently depress price pressures by lowering demand.Though UK inflation stands at 2.6% and could well hit double the bank's target rate of 2% in coming months as a result of a raft of price increases in April, such as domestic energy and water bills, economists think rate-setters will opt for a cut, given the anticipated slowdown.Unlike the Bank of England, and the European Central Bank, which last month cut interest rates too, the US Federal Reserve kept rates unchanged Wednesday as its policymakers wait to see how Trump's tariffs affect the US economy before making any moves.Inflation rates around the world are way down from levels seen a couple of years ago, partly because central banks dramatically increased borrowing costs from the near zero rates during the coronavirus pandemic. Prices then began to shoot up, first as a result of supply chain issues and later because of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which pushed energy costs higher.As inflation rates have declined from multidecade highs, central banks, including the Fed, have started cutting interest rates, though few, if any, economists think that rates will fall back to the super-low levels that persisted in the years after the global financial crisis of 2008-2009 and during the pandemic.","Bank of England is widely expected to cut interest rates on Thursday.

TOI CORRESPONDENT FROM LONDON: Despite the rhetoric that tensions between India and Pakistan might spill over onto Britain’s streets, things were calm on Wednesday and members of the Indian and Pakistani diaspora were all still getting on with each other.“Our fight is not against any community, religion, or nationality — it is against terrorism and the nations that sponsor it,” said a spokesman for British Indians Voice. He said the diaspora supported India’s military strike. “India has shown restraint for decades. This was not a reckless strike — it was a measured and necessary response to repeated acts of terror emanating from Pakistani soil. We stand with our homeland. It is time for the world to unite against terror. Because silence is no longer an option.”British Indian Santosh Patil said: “Terrorism has no place in a civilised society and anywhere where terrorist sympathising groups are based should meet the same fate. British Indians feel it is the right thing that happened as India attacked a terrorist group. We are still getting on with British Pakistani friends and neighbours.This is not an attack on Pakistan but on terrorism.”Ganapati Bhat, Kannadigaruuk president, said: “The whole community have a sense of justice being done because it was the worst of kind of terrorist attack on 22nd April and India has been at the receiving end of terrorism since Independence. Retaliation was not there previously, except for a couple of instances, and this time they have done it very well and eliminated this terrorist infrastructure so we feel satisfied. There is a bit of worry that things could impact trust issues among communities but I think people view Pakistan and terrorists as separate things. These things have been happening for over a decade, so I don’t see it spilling over into UK’s streets.”Amjid Ali Akram Jarral Rajput, a British Kashmiri with roots in J&K, said: “It’s dreadful what has happened.” He has family on both sides of border. “This is just another way to escalate what is happening and bring the world’s attention to Kashmir. This is due to what Britain did and the mess it left Kashmir in.”British Pakistani Murtuza Ali Shah, bureau chief for Geo News in the UK, said: “British Pakistanis are worried about their families in the region.” He said he did not see tensions playing out on UK streets. “We have all lived here a long time and fought racism together. Many of us are friends,” Shah said.","British Indian Santosh Patil said: “Terrorism has no place in a civilised society and anywhere where terrorist sympathising groups are based should meet the same fate.” British Pakistani Murtuza Ali Shah, bureau chief for Geo News in the UK, said he did not see tensions playing out on UK streets.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120974637,imgsize-953489,width-400,resizemode-4/120974637.jpg"

Working for GRU:

Like a 'spy novel':





Six Bulgarians, members of a sophisticated spy network dubbed ""The Minions"", were before court Wednesday for sentencing, facing up to 14 years in prison for spying for Russia The four men and two women either pled guilty or had been convicted of charges of conspiracy to spy at Russia's behest with their sentences due to be handed down on Monday, after four days of hearings at London's Old Bailey court.Between 2020 to 2023, the six-person cell targeted journalists and a Kazakh former politician, and plotted to kidnap and honeytrap targets, tracking them across several European nations.It was "" industrial-scale espionage on behalf of Russia"", Metropolitan police counter-terrorism Chief Commander Dominic Murphy said in March.Ringleader Orlin Roussev, 47, along with his second-in-command Bizer Dzhambazov, 43, and Ivan Stoyanov, 32, pled guilty to spying.Barrister for the prosecution, Alison Morgan, on Wednesday laid out their roles in different operations, stressing they knew they were spying for Moscow.London-based Katrin Ivanova, 33, Vanya Gaberova, 30, and Tihomir Ivanchev, 39, were convicted in March after a trial lasting more than three months at the Old Bailey court.Two of the group were in court on Wednesday, with the rest appearing by video link from their detention centres.They had dubbed themselves ""The Minions"" after the cartoon yellow characters in the film ""Despicable Me"" who work for the dastardly Gru. The six also worked for the GRU, the acronym for the Russian military intelligence service.The group launched operations in the UK as well as Austria, Spain, Germany and Montenegro.But UK police were able to retrace six operations thanks to more than 100,000 messages found on Roussev's Telegram account, which led police to his seaside home in the eastern town of Great Yarmouth.Roussev received his instructions from Jan Marsalek, an Austrian fugitive who reportedly fled to Russia in 2020 after becoming wanted for fraud in Germany.Marsalek, the former chief operating officer of payments firm Wirecard, was acting as a proxy for Russian intelligence services.One operation targeted investigative journalist Christo Grozev, from the Bellingcat website, who uncovered Russian links to the 2018 Novichok chemical weapon attack in the English town of Salisbury and the downing of a Malaysia Airlines aeroplane four years earlier.The group had planned ""disruptive activity"" at the Kazakh embassy in 2022, discussing a plan to spray the building with fake pig's blood.Roussev received more than 200,000 euros ($227,000) to fund his activities.After the gang was busted in February 2023, police found huge amounts of spyware equipment in his home, including cameras and microphones hidden in ties, a stone, even a cuddly toy and a fizzy drinks bottle.In messages to Marsalek, Roussev claimed ""he will find the resources"" to ""keep the Russians happy"" such as by kidnapping someone, Morgan said.""The defendants were deployed to gather information about prominent individuals whose activities were of obvious interest to the Russian state,"" she added.Murphy said in March that police had found ""really sophisticated devices -- the sort of thing you would really expect to see in a spy novel"".Journalist and UK-based dissident Roman Dobrokhotov, and former Kazakh politician Bergey Ryskaliev, granted refugee status in Britain, were also among their targets.The group also kept the US military base Patch Barracks in Stuttgart, Germany, under surveillance, believing Ukrainian soldiers were being trained there in using the Patriot air defence system.Ties between Britain and Russia have been strained since Moscow's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine.British security minister Dan Jarvis warned the convictions should ""send a clear warning to those who wish to do the UK harm"".","Six Bulgarians, members of a sophisticated spy network dubbed ""The Minions"", facing up to 14 years in prison for spying for Russia.

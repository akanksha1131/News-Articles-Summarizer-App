Hong Kong Horror: New Footage Shows Exact Moment Fire Started And Swept High-Rise Towers | On Cam





Hong Kong on Saturday entered a three-day official mourning period for victims of the devastating fire at the Wang Fuk Court residential complex in Tai Po, as the death toll climbed to 128 and investigations widened.Authorities also announced that eight more people have been arrested in connection with the tragedy, one of the worst building fires the city has seen in decades.The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) said the latest arrests include engineering consultants, scaffolding subcontractors and a middleman involved in renovation works at the estate.They are being investigated for suspected corruption linked to repair and maintenance projects at the site, news agency ANI reported, citing the Global Times.The blaze erupted on Wednesday afternoon on scaffolding at one of the towers under large-scale renovation, before rapidly spreading to six neighbouring blocks covered with protective netting and construction materials.Firefighters battled the flames for more than 40 hours and used a team of nearly 1,000 personnel for rescue.Officials said at least 79 people have been injured, including 12 firefighters, while around 200 residents are still missing.Nearly 900 evacuees have been moved to temporary shelters as search and relief efforts continue.Early findings from the government’s briefing revealed alarming safety failures. Fire Services Director Andy Yeung confirmed that alarm systems in all eight buildings malfunctioned, leaving residents with no warning as the flames engulfed their homes.Investigators also found highly flammable polystyrene boards, foam packaging, bamboo scaffolding, and non-compliant netting around the building. These materials significantly accelerated the spread of the fire, according to AFP.“We do not rule out the possibility that police will find more charred remains when entering (the building) for detailed investigation and evidence collection,” Security Secretary Chris Tang told reporters.He added that the identification process for victims is still ongoing.Earlier, three men linked to the renovation contract were arrested on suspicion of manslaughter and gross negligence. The Hong Kong government has now ordered urgent, city-wide inspections of all scaffolding and construction materials used in renovation works.As the mourning period began, Chief Executive John Lee led senior officials in a three-minute silence as flags flew at half-mast. Across the city, condolence points were set up and residents laid flowers near the charred towers.Families are still searching hospitals and identification centres for loved ones.“She is on antibiotics... so she is always sleeping. There was no fire alarm… she might not have known there was a fire,” said Mr Fung, who has been trying to locate his elderly mother-in-law.The blaze has become Hong Kong’s deadliest fire since 1948 and has raised urgent questions over safety compliance in ageing public housing. Authorities say a full investigation could take up to four weeks.","Authorities also announced that eight more people have been arrested in connection with the tragedy.

BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia hospitalised; condition 'extremely critical',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bnp-chairperson-khaleda-zia-hospitalised-condition-extremely-critical/articleshow/125650030.cms,".





Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) chairperson and former prime minister Khaleda Zia is in “extremely critical” condition, a close aide said on Friday, as she continues treatment in hospital. The 80-year-old leader was admitted on Sunday night after developing a chest infection that affected both her heart and lungs.“Last night, the doctors said that her physical condition is extremely critical,” BNP secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir said on Friday, as quoted by PTI, citing the state-run BSS news agency.Following Friday prayers, the BNP organized special prayer gatherings across the country for her recovery. “We have sought prayers from the people across the country after Jummah prayers for the recovery of the ‘Mother of Democracy’, Begum Khaleda Zia. We pray that she may recover and return to the people to get the opportunity to work for the country,” Fakhrul added.Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus expressed deep concern over Zia’s condition and urged everyone to pray for her early recovery. His office said Yunus has been regularly inquiring about updates on her health and has instructed officials to ensure every form of necessary medical support.“There must not be any shortcomings in Begum Khaleda Zia's treatment. The government is prepared to provide all necessary support,” Yunus said. “At this crucial moment of democratic transition, Begum Khaleda Zia is a profound source of inspiration for the nation. Her good health is extremely important for the country.”Zia has long suffered from multiple health complications, including liver and kidney issues, diabetes, arthritis, and eye-related illnesses. She is the widow of slain president Zia-ur Rahman. Her elder son, Tarique Rahman, has been living in London since 2008, while her younger son, Arafat Rahman, died of a cardiac arrest in 2025.With national elections approaching next year, Zia’s health is seen as particularly significant for the party. The BNP has emerged as a key player in Bangladesh’s changing political landscape after a student-led protest toppled Sheikh Hasina’s Awami League government on August 5, 2024.Earlier this year, Zia returned to Bangladesh from London on May 6 after spending four months abroad for advanced medical treatment.","The 80-year-old leader was admitted on Sunday night after developing a chest infection that affected both her heart and lungs.

America’s Spy Network COLLAPSES In Caribbean; NATO Allies CUT Intel Ties After ‘Drug-Boat’ Strikes

REPORT: Second strike to kill survivors on alleged drug boats





The US military reportedly carried out a second strike on a suspected drug boat in the Caribbean on September 2 to kill survivors.Defence secretary Pete Hegseth reportedly instructed the military before the operation to ensure no one survived. “The order was to kill everybody,” a source told Washington Post.The September strike became the first in a series of US attacks on suspected drug boats in the region. The first strike reportedly disabled the vessel and caused several deaths. When the military assessed that some crew members were still alive, a second strike was launched. All 11 people on board were killed, and the boat was sunk.Briefing materials given to the White House said that the “double-tap,” or follow-up strike, was meant to sink the boat and clear a navigation hazard for other vessels, not to target survivors, according to someone who saw the report.Officials have admitted they do not always know who is on board before launching strikes. This has alarmed lawmakers.""I have been alarmed by the number of vessels that this administration has taken out without a single consultation of Congress,” Democratic Rep Madeleine Dean told CNN this week.Pentagon has defended the actions, saying they comply with US and international law. The administration claims the boats carry individuals linked to drug cartels posing an imminent threat.But legal experts argue these groups are not combatants and should be treated as criminals, not enemy fighters.In a social media post on Friday, Hegseth again defended the strikes on suspected drug boats.“Our current operations in the Caribbean are lawful under both US and international law, with all actions in compliance with the law of armed conflict and approved by the best military and civilian lawyers, up and down the chain of command,” he said.","The US military reportedly carried out a second strike on a suspected drug boat in the Caribbean on September 2 to kill survivors.

Pope joins patriarchs from East and West at historic Christian site in Turkey to pray for unity,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/pope-joins-patriarchs-from-east-and-west-at-historic-christian-site-in-turkey-to-pray-for-unity/articleshow/125649812.cms,"Photo credit: AP





IZNIK: Pope Leo XIV joined Eastern and Western patriarchs and priests Friday in commemorating an important anniversary in Christian history, gathering at the site in Turkey of an unprecedented A.D. 325 meeting of bishops to pray that Christians might once again be united.Leo, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I and other Christian leaders met on the shores of Lake Iznik, the site of the Council of Nicaea that produced a creed, or statement of faith, that is still recited by millions of Christians today.Standing over the ruins of the site, the men recited the creed, which Leo said was ""of fundamental importance in the journey that Christians are making toward full communion.""""In this way, we are all invited to overcome the scandal of the divisions that unfortunately still exist and to nurture the desire for unity for which the Lord Jesus prayed and gave his life,"" he said.The prayer marked the highlight of Leo's visit to Turkey and the main reason for his trip, the first of his pontificate.A crucial moment in Christianity The Nicaea gathering took place at a time when the Eastern and Western churches were still united.They split in the Great Schism of 1054, a divide precipitated largely by disagreements over the primacy of the pope. But even today, Catholic, Orthodox and most historic Protestant groups accept the Nicaean Creed, making it a point of agreement and the most widely accepted creed in Christendom.As a result, celebrating its origins at the site of its creation with the spiritual leaders of the Catholic and Orthodox churches and other Christian representatives marked a historic moment in the centuries-old quest to reunite all Christians.""The Nicene Creed acts like a seed for the whole of our Christian existence. It is a symbol not of a bare minimum; it is a symbol of the whole,"" said Bartholomew, spiritual leader of the world's Orthodox Christians.At the start of the prayer service, he told the men they were gathering not just to remember the past.""We are here to bear living witness to the same faith expressed by the fathers of Nicaea. We return to this wellspring of the Christian faith in order to move forward,"" he said.A prayer for unity Roman Emperor Constantine had convened the gathering of bishops from around the Roman Empire after he had consolidated control following years of civil war and political intrigues.Constantine wouldn't formally convert to Christianity until the end of his life, in 337. But by 325, he had already been showing tolerance and favor toward a Christian sect that had emerged from the last great spasm of Roman persecution.The version of the creed that emerged from the council, and recited today by Catholics, begins: ""I believe in one God, the Father almighty ... ""The service commemoration, which featured alternating Catholic and Orthodox hymns, took place at the lakeside archaeological excavations of the ancient Basilica of Saint Neophytos. The stone foundations of the basilica, which were recently uncovered by the lake's receding waters, are believed to be on the site of an earlier church that hosted the council 1,700 years ago.In addition to Leo and Bartholomew, the participants of the commemorative service included priests, patriarchs and bishops from Orthodox Greek, Syrian, Coptic, Malankarese, Armenian, Protestant and Anglican churches.In his remarks to the men, Leo said all Christians must strongly reject the use of religion to justify war, violence ""or any form of fundamentalism or fanaticism.""""Instead, the paths to follow are those of fraternal encounter, dialogue and cooperation,"" he said.A brief protest before Leo arrived Christians are a minority in predominantly Sunni Muslim Turkey, and ahead of the prayer in Iznik, around 20 members of a small Turkish Islamic party staged a brief protest. They said the encounter posed a threat to Turkey's sovereignty and national identity.Under a heavy police presence, Mehmet Kaygusuz, a member of the New Welfare Party, read a statement denouncing what he said were efforts to establish a ""Vatican-like Greek Orthodox state"" in Turkey. The group dispersed peacefully shortly after.Iznik resident Suleyman Bulut, 35, acknowledged his town's deep historical and spiritual significance for Christians and said he had no issue with them coming to honor their heritage.""Muslims (too) should go and visit places that belong to us in the rest of the world, in Europe,"" he said.But Hasan Maral, a 41-year-old shopkeeper said he felt uncomfortable with visit. ""The pope coming here feels contradictory to my faith,"" he said.A boost for Turkey's tiny Catholic community Leo began his first full day in Istanbul by encouraging Turkey's tiny Catholic community to find strength in their small numbers. According to Vatican statistics, Catholics number around 33,000 in a nation of 85 million, most of whom are Sunni Muslims.He received a raucous welcome at the Cathedral of the Holy Spirit, where he was greeted with shouts of ""Papa Leo"" and ""Viva il Papa"" (Long Live the pope).""The logic of littleness is the church's true strength,"" Leo told them in English. ""The significant presence of migrants and refugees in this country presents the church with the challenge of welcoming and serving some of the most vulnerable.""Leo later visited with a group of nuns, the Little Sisters of the Poor, who run a nursing home in Istanbul.""He was so simple. We just felt he was at home. He felt very much at ease. Everybody got what they expected: a blessing, a kind word. It's just enormous,"" said Sister Margret of the Little Sisters of the Poor Nursing Home.On Saturday, Leo continues with his ecumenical focus, meeting with Bartholomew and other Christian leaders. But he'll also visit the Sultan Ahmed Mosque, commonly known as the Blue Mosque, and will celebrate a late afternoon Mass in Istanbul's Volkswagen Arena.Leo heads to Lebanon on Sunday for the second and final leg of his trip.",Pope Leo XIV joins Eastern and Western patriarchs and priests in commemorating an important anniversary in Christian history.

"Ekman, who linked facial expressions to emotions, dies at 91",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/ekman-who-linked-facial-expressions-to-emotions-dies-at-91/articleshow/125649854.cms,"



Paul Ekman, a psychologist who linked thousands of facial expressions to the emotions they often subconsciously conveyed, and who used his research to advise FBI interrogators and screeners for the Transportation Security Administration as well as Hollywood animators, died Nov 17 at his home in San Francisco. He was 91.Ekman sought to add scientific exactitude to the human impulse to interpret how others feel through their facial expressions. He recorded 18 types of smiles, for example, distinguishing between a forced smile and a spontaneous one; a genuine smile, he discovered, crinkles the orbicularis oculi muscle - that is, it creates crow's feet around the eyes.Sometimes described as the world's most famous face reader, Ekman was influential in reshaping the way facial expressions were understood - as the product of evolution rather than environment - and his findings crossed over to popular culture.As a young researcher in the late 1960s, Ekman changed the scientific consensus on facial expressions. In the postwar era, the conventional wisdom of eminent anthropologists like Margaret Mead was that human facial expressions were learned and that they varied across cultures. Ekman believed otherwise. He showed photographs of people making faces expressing 30 different emotions - including anger, joy and fear - to subjects in the United States, Japan and South America.Across cultures, the study's participants linked the expressions they were shown with the same emotions.He then travelled to Papua New Guinea with a colleague, Wallace V Friesen, and showed the same pictures to some 300 Indigenous people who had no exposure to modern media and could not have learned to interpret faces that way. These subjects also connected the expressions to the same emotions.""There is a pan-cultural element in facial expressions of emotion,"" Ekman wrote in a paper in 1970 on returning to the United States.","Paul Ekman, a psychologist who linked thousands of facial expressions to the emotions they often subconsciously conveyed, died Nov 17 at his home in San Francisco.

‘Can’t Believe…’: DC Suspect’s Family Speaks Out As Trump Mulls Deportation For His Wife, 5 Kids

Trump Questioned On Who Granted Asylum To DC Shooter





Trump administration on Friday ordered US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) officers to stop making all asylum decisions, following the shooting of two National Guard soldiers in Washington, DC.The pause comes after Wednesday’s attack, which officials say was carried out by an Afghan man who received asylum earlier this year. One of the soldiers has died. The suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, entered the US in 2021 under the Biden administration’s humanitarian parole programme and was granted asylum this spring.The order affects all nationalities and covers “affirmative” asylum cases handled by USCIS. Officers were told to continue interviews and case reviews, but stop at the point where a decision would normally be entered. In-person appointments scheduled for Monday, where applicants receive final decisions, were also cancelled.In a statement to CBS News, USCIS director Joe Edlow confirmed the decision. He said, ""USCIS has halted all asylum decisions until we can ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible,"" Edlow said.""The safety of the American people always comes first.""The move is part of a wider set of immigration actions announced after the shooting. Earlier, the administration paused the processing of all legal immigration applications from Afghan nationals, including green cards, citizenship and work permits.USCIS has also begun a detailed review of green card cases involving people from 19 countries listed under a presidential proclamation issued in June.Late on Thursday, president Trump said he intended to “permanently pause migration from all third world countries.” He also said his administration would revoke the citizenship of those it considers a threat to “domestic tranquillity” and deport any foreign national viewed as a security risk or “non-compatible with Western civilisation.”","US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) officers to stop making all asylum decisions.

UN calls on Pakistan to respect Imran Khan's human-rights





Former Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan 's son Kasim Khan on Thursday claimed his father has been kept in a ""death cell with zero transparency"", despite Islamabad refuting rumours that the cricketer-turned-politician was “brutally” assaulted by police for seeking a meeting with their brother last week.Kasim Khan said there have been ""no phone calls, no meetings and no proof of life. Me and my brother have had no contact with our father.""He alleged that the former prime minister, who has been under arrest for 845 days, has been kept in solitary confinement for the past six weeks. He also said that Khan’s sisters have been denied permission to visit him despite court orders allowing access.Kasim further alleged that the Shehbaz Sharif-led government and “its handlers” will be held accountable “legally, morally and internationally”.He also urged the international community to “intervene urgently” and demand proof of life.Earlier, Imran Khan’s sister, Noreen Niazi, accused Pakistani authorities of keeping the former prime minister in harsh prison conditions and cutting off all family contact, claiming that “no one knows what’s happening inside the jail.”Speaking to ANI about her last meeting with the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder, she said, “...Heis going through a tough time alone. He is in isolation... As per the jail manual, one can't be placed in isolation for more than 4 days. But he was put in isolation for three weeks last year as well, during which electricity was switched off, and he wasn't even allowed to read books. The same has been done now.”Her allegations come against the backdrop of growing speculation about Khan’s health and the month-long blackout on family and legal visits. “We don't know anything. They are not telling us anything, nor are they letting anybody meet him,” she said, adding that even PTI members with approved meetings were prevented from entering.“We have not been allowed to meet him for the last four weeks... The Police have been ordered to stop us and, I believe, also given permission to do to us whatever they want. This has never happened in Pakistan before,” she said.Niazi described the treatment of supporters and family members outside Adiala Jail as unprecedented. “No one has ever disrespected women like this, nor has anyone been oppressed this way. This is the first time in Pakistan that these people have been allowed to beat up people like there won't be any consequences, without considering if it's a child, an elderly person, or a woman in front of them. The world is aware of what's happening in Pakistan. ”She called the current situation Pakistan’s “darkest period”, comparing it to “Hitler-era-like repression”, and alleged that people are being “killed, beaten, and jailed without accountability”. She argued that the continued ban on meeting Khan was intentional. “We have been going there for the last four weeks, and they are not letting us meet him. This is why such rumours are spreading.”Warning of growing frustration, she said public anger is nearing a tipping point. “I believe there will be a spark among people soon, and then they will see the level to which the people go... The oppression is too much.”Expressing no expectations from the global community, she said: ""... We have such support from outside that Trump called our dictator Asim Munir a very good friend of his... Shehbaz Sharif had lost his seat. Asim Munir helped him win, so he is the bigger force... Dictators have come before. Their fates were not good either. But how long can these people survive, or how long can they continue to oppress?""Meanwhile, adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah and senior Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leaders on Thursday rejected rumours about former prime minister Imran Khan’s deteriorating health, saying the PTI founder was “fine and nothing is wrong with him,” reported Pakistan daily Dawn News.Earlier in the day, the PTI pressed for a meeting with the jailed leader, expressing concern over his condition after he was denied access to his family and lawyers for more than three weeks. Imran has been in prison since August 2023, serving a 14-year sentence in a corruption case.His family members and party activists have been staging protests outside Adiala Jail in recent days, demanding he be allowed visitors. A PTI delegation once again attempted to meet him on Thursday, but authorities refused permission.The UN's deputy spokesperson reaffirmed that the world body has urged Pakistani authorities to ensure the human rights and due-process rights of Imran Khan are respected.This follows his arrest and ongoing legal proceedings -- the UN has emphasized that in such politically sensitive cases, fair treatment under law and procedural fairness are essential.In a response to ANI, United Nations deputy spokesperson Farhan Haq said, ""We have called for his human rights and due process rights to be respected.""","Pakistan Erupts As Imran Khan’s Son Claims ‘No Proof Of Life’ Amid CM Afridi's Jail-Side Protest.'Darkest period' in Pakistan, says sister Noreen Niazi.

The government closed offices and schools Friday as conditions worsened, reported AP. Heavy downpours since last week flooded homes, fields, and roads, triggering landslides across the island. Overflowing rivers and reservoirs have blocked key roads, while rocks, mud, and fallen trees have obstructed roads and railway tracks, some of which were submerged, forcing authorities to suspend passenger train services in many areas.The central tea-growing district of Badulla was worst hit, where 21 people were killed overnight when a landslide buried homes, the Disaster Management Centre (DMC) said. Four more died in neighboring Nuwara Eliya, while other fatalities were reported across the country. Over 1,800 families have been moved to temporary shelters, AFP reported.Videos shared on social media showed homes being washed away, while military and navy personnel used helicopters and boats to rescue stranded residents. Students scheduled for Advanced Level exams also had their tests postponed, BBC reported.Sri Lanka is currently in its northeast monsoon season, worsened by Cyclone Ditwah, which formed off the island’s eastern coast and is expected to move toward India. River levels continue to rise, prompting the DMC to warn residents in low-lying areas, including Colombo, to move to higher ground. The Irrigation Department issued a red-level flood warning for the Kelani River valley over the next 48 hours, and the Met Office has forecast over 200 mm of rainfall in some central and northern regions on Friday.BBC cited DMC saying that around 20,500 army personnel have been deployed nationwide to aid in rescue and relief operations.","Heavy downpours since last week have flooded homes, fields, and roads, triggering landslides across the island.

Tips to avoid accumulating black points





Maintain a safe distance from other vehicles. Yield to pedestrians and emergency vehicles at all times. Wear your seatbelt and ensure children are seated safely in the car. Avoid using your mobile phone while driving. Follow parking rules and avoid blocking fire hydrants or reserved spaces. Be extra cautious near school zones and bus stops. Regularly check your black points through apps, SMS notifications, or official websites.





Driving in the UAE comes with responsibilities, and the Black Points System is at the heart of keeping roads safe for everyone. Introduced to curb reckless driving and reduce accidents, it assigns points to your license for traffic violations. Accumulating these points can lead to hefty fines, vehicle impoundment, or even license suspension. For both residents and visitors, understanding how black points work, which violations carry them, and how to check your status is essential. Staying informed can help you avoid penalties and ensure a smoother, safer driving experience across all emirates.Black points are penalties assigned to a driver’s license for traffic violations. Introduced in July 2017 under Ministerial Resolution No. 178/2017, the system applies across all UAE emirates, including Dubai and Abu Dhabi.Violations are recorded using an advanced network of cameras, radars, and AI-powered monitoring systems. Once a violation is detected and confirmed, drivers typically receive an SMS notification within 48 hours detailing the offense, the fine, and the number of black points added.The system is designed not only to penalize drivers financially but also to track repeat offenses, which can ultimately lead to license suspension or mandatory retraining. It ensures safer roads and consistently encourages responsible driving behavior, moreover supporting long-term compliance.The UAE uses a 24 point scale to manage driving penalties:License suspension periods are based on how many times the 24 point limit is reached:Drivers can monitor their black points in several ways:In addition to black points, violations can also result in hefty fines, vehicle impoundment, and a daily impoundment fee of Dh100.The UAE enforces 143 federal traffic laws, each with penalties to maintain road discipline. Some of the most common violations include:These penalties are carefully designed to encourage responsible driving and protect all road users.Checking your black points is simple and can help you avoid penalties:Regular monitoring ensures you are aware of your points and prevents unexpected license suspensions or retraining requirements.By following these practices, drivers can stay safe, avoid fines, and prevent their license from being suspended.","Black points are penalties assigned to a driver’s license for traffic violations.

When real people are turned into disposable archetypes

Projection disguised as commentary





The ending that should disturb all of us









Since Donald Trump announced he would be picking JD Vance to be his running mate, Usha Vance has undergone the kind of scrutiny that has hardly ever occurred to an Indian-American. MAGA folks freaked out that she was a practising Hindu, and it was immaterial that her faith had helped JD find Christ again. Democrats wondered how a person with Usha’s credentials (Yale, academic family) could be with someone like JD or who followed JD’s politics. JD Vance hasn’t helped himself, like the time he told a Turning Point USA audience that he hoped his “agnostic” wife — what a way to erase her religion — would embrace Christ, even doubling down to claim that it was every Christian’s job to help others see the light. But even after all the disparaging rumours aimed at Usha Vance, a recent podcast featuring Joy Reid starkly shows how easy it is for people to dehumanise Indian-Americans.Reid, wearing a t-shirt that says F*** Trump, F*** ICE, Free Palestine, Unoccupy Chicago, and a bunch of other messages which combined explain the dire strait in which the Democratic Party finds itself, casually claims that JD Vance will drop his “brown Hindu wife” Usha for “white queen” Erika Kirk.What makes this moment especially disturbing is how neatly it fits into the rise of anti-India hate online and offline.In recent years, Indians in the West have found themselves cast into every role except that of actual human beings. They are colonial agents one day, fascist foot soldiers the next, tech bros on Monday, caste villains on Tuesday, and accidental beneficiaries of “white adjacency” by the weekend. It is a rotating caricature factory that reduces 1.4 billion people to whichever label best suits the Western cultural mood. And Indian-Americans are often caught at the intersection of all these projections. The same progressives who champion diversity suddenly talk as if Hindu identity is a contaminated category. The same conservatives who praise family values treat brown families as demographic threats. Usha Vance, unfortunately, becomes the perfect canvas for the week’s anxieties. Not because of anything she said, but because her existence unsettles the simplistic narratives both sides prefer.The moment Reid begins to speak, it is clear this is not analysis. It is improvisation dressed up as political insight. “They can’t have the successor to MAGA be the guy with the brown Hindu wife,” she declares, as if she has unlocked a hidden psychological truth about an entire voting bloc. She calls them “Christian nationalists,” insists Usha “won’t work,” and then suggests JD Vance is either sacrificing his wife for ambition or that Usha herself is complicit in the performance.She then fixates on JD Vance’s public hug with Erika Kirk, calling it “slap-and-tickle” and “the weirdest shit,” and pivots to critiquing Erika’s clothing with, “You’re supposed to be a widow. You in leather pants?” These are not the observations of a serious political thinker. They are the lines of someone scrolling through gossip threads and mistaking them for structural analysis.Finally she arrives at the centrepiece of her theory. “Wouldn’t it be the most perfect MAGA fairytale if he finally sees the light that he needs a white queen instead of this brown Hindu.” She adds a quick “I’m not saying that’s happening,” but the narrative is already complete. The hierarchy is drawn. The brown woman is written out.What is most striking about the segment is the contradiction between Reid’s t-shirt and her argument. She wears slogans about liberation, solidarity, resistance and justice. Then she denies every one of those ideals to a brown woman who did nothing except marry someone with different politics.Reid says she is calling out racism, but she ends up performing it. She does not see Usha Vance as a lawyer, a mother, a daughter of immigrants or a woman balancing two faith traditions. She sees her as a demographic problem. A cultural obstacle. An inconvenient symbol of brownness and Hindu identity that, in her mind, cannot fit inside a movement she despises.It is easy to condemn racism when it comes from the other side. It is harder to notice when it slips out while criticising the other side. The t-shirt says “Free Palestine.” The monologue denies empathy to an Indian-American Hindu woman who is, by every measure, as much a minority as anyone Reid claims to defend.Underneath the moral performance, the entire theory comes from three unrelated moments. Erika Kirk, grieving the murder of her husband, said she wished she had been pregnant when he died. It was a moment of pain, not a confession. JD Vance hugged her on stage in full public view. It was sympathy, not symbolism. And Usha Vance appeared without her wedding ring one afternoon. It was an ordinary oversight, not a marital crisis.None of these events belong together. They were stitched into a story only because the internet craves drama. And instead of challenging that logic, Reid absorbed it, embroidered it and presented it as something profound.The widow became an archetype. The wife became a liability. The husband became a character in a political telenovela.It was rumour inflated into racial prophecy.There is a special cruelty in dragging two women into a plot they never agreed to inhabit. Erika Kirk is barely beginning her life as a widow, yet she is recast as a “white queen” waiting in the wings. Usha Vance, who has kept an almost painfully private profile, is turned into an emblem of “brown Hindu” undesirability. Neither woman asked to be the heroine or the villain of this fever dream. Neither deserves to be reduced to the colour wheel of someone else’s political imagination.JD Vance, for all his flaws, becomes a piece on a board. In Reid’s story he is not a husband or father. He is a man conducting a marital reshuffle to please a base that exists only inside her claim.The humanity is lost. What remains is theatre.The problem is not simply that Joy Reid repeated a conspiracy. It is that she treated it as obvious. She began with the assumption that MAGA is racist and ended with the conclusion that its chosen successor must behave in ways that confirm her view. It is commentary built backwards: the conclusion arrives first, the justification later. This is the same logic she spent years accusing right-wing media of using. Start with the villain. Start with the allegation. Fill in the rest. Do not worry about the truth. Worry about the story.When the noise settles, the truth is small and human. A widow missing her husband. A woman who occasionally forgets her ring. A public hug meant as comfort. There is no conspiracy here. Only life happening in its messy, tender, inconvenient way.Yet three people were dragged through a podcast and reduced to plot points. Usha became the wrong kind of wife. Erika became the tempting “other woman.” JD became the protagonist of a love triangle that never existed.And this was said on a platform that presents itself as political thought.Imagine, for a moment, the mirror image. Imagine a conservative podcaster declaring that Michelle Obama was the “wrong kind of wife,” and that Barack Obama needed a “white queen” to be more acceptable to America. Imagine the outrage. Imagine the editorials. Imagine the rightly furious conversations about racism, misogyny and the dehumanisation of Black women.Now imagine what Usha Vance felt hearing her marriage framed the same way. This was not commentary. It was a small, callous story told with the confidence of someone who assumed there would be no consequences. It revealed how quickly empathy collapses when the woman in question does not belong to your political tribe. It showed how easily the language of justice can be used to justify the erasure of someone else’s dignity. The podcast will fade. The clip will scroll away. But the message remains. It tells us that for some commentators, solidarity is conditional. Dignity is selective. And some women are granted humanity only when their politics align. That should trouble us far more than any rumour ever could.","Since Donald Trump announced he would be picking JD Vance to be his running mate, Usha Vance has undergone the kind of scrutiny that has hardly ever occurred to an Indian-American.

'Treated very harshly': Trump pardons ex-Honduras president Hernandez ahead of elections,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/treated-very-harshly-trump-pardons-ex-honduras-president-hernandez-ahead-of-elections/articleshow/125649378.cms,"Hernandez, Trump (AP file photos)

.





US president Donald Trump on Friday intervened in Honduras' politics by pardoning former president Juan Orlando Hernandez, just days before the country votes for a new president, and warned that US support to the country could be cut if his preferred candidate loses.Hernandez was convicted in a US court last year for drug trafficking and given a 45-year sentence. He governed Honduras from 2014 to 2022 and was accused by US prosecutors of helping move nearly 400 tonnes of cocaine into the United States. He was extradited soon after leaving office, when the current president, Xiomara Castro, took power.Trump’s announcement came through a social media post backing Nasry Asfura, the candidate from Hernandez’s right-wing party. Trump had already endorsed Asfura, but this time he went further, suggesting that future US aid depends on Asfura winning Sunday’s election.On Truth Social, Trump wrote, ""If he doesn't win, the United States will not be throwing good money after bad, because a wrong leader can only bring catastrophic results to a country, no matter which country it is."" He issued a similar warning before Argentina’s election last month.Asfura, a 67-year-old construction businessman and former mayor of Tegucigalpa, is in a close three-way race against leftist lawyer Rixi Moncada and right-wing TV host Salvador Nasralla.Trump accused Nasralla, 72, of acting as a spoiler who would split the right-wing vote. He pointed out that Nasralla previously served as Castro’s vice president before resigning, and claimed he is now “pretending” to be anti-Communist.Trump also criticised Moncada, calling her a “communist” and claiming her win would benefit Venezuela’s Nicolas Maduro and “his Narcoterrorists.”The decision to pardon Hernández comes at a time when Washington is carrying out a large anti-drug operation in Latin America, where more than 80 people have been killed in strikes in international waters.A New York jury convicted Hernandez in March 2024 for helping move cocaine from Colombia and Venezuela into the United States since 2004, years before he became president. After his sentencing, former US attorney general Merrick Garland said Hernandez had abused his office to support a major drug-trafficking conspiracy.In his post on Friday, Trump said Hernández had been treated “very harshly and unfairly,” but did not explain further.","Hernandez was convicted in a US court last year for drug trafficking and given a 45-year sentence.

This decision comes in the aftermath of a tragic incident involving an Afghan national, which has reignited discussions on immigration from 'Third World countries.





The US Treasury is moving to cut off federal benefits to ""illegal aliens"" and preserve them for US citizens, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Friday. The action is being taken at the direction of US President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly criticised current immigration policies in US.Treasury ""announced that it will issue proposed regulations clarifying that the refunded portions of certain individual income tax benefits are no longer available to illegal and other non-qualified aliens, covering the Earned Income Tax Credit, the Additional Child Tax Credit, the American Opportunity Tax Credit, and the Saver’s Match Credit,"" Bessent said on X.The announcement comes after a deadly attack earlier this week, when two members of the National Guard were shot by an Afghan national just blocks from the White House in Washington, DC. One of the victims died of injuries and one remains in critical condition.The shooter was identified as a 29-year-old Afghan national named Rahmatullah Lakanwal. He was wounded during the encounter and taken into custody. Investigation is ongoing with the help of various federal agencies even considering terror angles.According to CNN, the shooter had previous ties to US intelligence agencies, including the CIA, and was vetted to enter the US in 2021 after fleeing Afghanistan, where he had assisted American military against the Taliban.Bessent’s comments were made in response to a post by Donald Trump on Truth Social following the shooting, in which the US president himself vented out on current immigration policy.The MAGA chief announced a permanent pause on migration from “Third World countries,” including Afghan nationals. The pause also affects green card and asylum applications, as Trump’s team said it plans to review past admissions it considers “illegal” or unsafe. The administration framed the action as necessary to protect national security and to prevent similar attacks in the future.","Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced plans to limit federal tax benefits for undocumented immigrants.

What is an autopen?





US President Donald Trump on Friday said he is cancelling all executive orders signed by former President Joe Biden using an autopen and warned that Biden could face “charges of perjury” if he claims that staff were acting under his direction.The MAGA chief posted on Truth Social: “Any document signed by Sleepy Joe Biden with the Autopen, which was approximately 92% of them, is hereby terminated, and of no further force or effect. The Autopen is not allowed to be used if approval is not specifically given by the President of the United States.”Trump added: “The Radical Left Lunatics circling Biden around the beautiful Resolute Desk in the Oval Office took the Presidency away from him. I am hereby cancelling all Executive Orders, and anything else that was not directly signed by Crooked Joe Biden, because the people who operated the Autopen did so illegally. Joe Biden was not involved in the Autopen process and, if he says he was, he will be brought up on charges of perjury. Thank you for your attention to this matter!”Trump has long claimed that Biden was mostly absent during his four-year term and that unelected aides were running the country in place of him without proper authorisation.He has already revoked many of Biden’s executive orders and even suggested that some of his pardons may be invalid.The autopen is a mechanical device used to automate presidential signatures. It carries full legal force if staff are acting under the president’s directive. It has been used by chief executives for decades, including for routine proclamations, constituent letters, and, in rare cases, legislation.A House Republican investigation into Biden’s autopen use earlier this year found no direct evidence that aides acted without presidential approval, according to the New York Post. The inquiry found that Biden seldom met with key West Wing officials and there were internal concerns about how his verbally given instructions were being carried out, including crucial decisions on end-of-term clemency.",Donald Trump cancels all executive orders signed by Joe Biden using an autopen.

Neighbors of 29-year-old Rahmanullah Lakanwal were aware that the family of Afghan refugees were living in the area but they never got to know much about the family as 'they never made a peep'. Their apartment was mostly empty, a neighbor told New York Post. There was no beds and only some cushions to sleep on. Lakanwal had a delivery driver job with Amazon Flex but as an independent contractor and was not working lately. His last delivery was recorded to be in August. The 7-member family including five children, kept to themselves and Rahmanullah was often seen playing Call of Duty and FIFA inside their apartment.Lakanwal did not speak much English, a neighbor confirmed.The Lakanwal family had been living in the Bellingham area of Washington State and Lakanwal drove to DC to carry out the attack that is now being probed as a premeditated terror attack. Lakanwal is not cooperating with the agencies and investigators have not yet pinpointed any motive behind his ambush-style attack.""There are certainly many more charges to come, but we are upgrading the initial charges of assault to murder in the first degree,"" Jeanine Pirro, the attorney for Washington DC, told the Fox News program Fox & Friends.""It is a premeditated murder. There was an ambush with a gun toward people who didn't know what was coming.""Attorney General Pam Bondi promised to seek death penalty for 'moster' Lakanwal. Lakanwal was allowed to enter the US under Biden's resettlement program for Afghan refugees as he was part of the ""Zero Units"" -- a CIA-backed Afghan paramilitary force.

What the op-ed said





Donald Trump Jr. criticised the Wall Street Journal editorial board on Friday after the paper published an op-ed defending Afghan refugees living in the United States.The Journal’s editorial was titled “The Ambush on the National Guard.” It argued that Afghan refugees should not be blamed for the actions of a single individual.Recently, two National Guardsmen were shot by a suspected Afghan national, killing one of them and leaving one critically injured. The Trump administration halted all immigration requests from Afghan nationals and later extended the pause to include migration from all Third World countries.The WSJ piece said: ""The ambush of two West Virginia National Guard members near the White House Wednesday afternoon is horrifying on its own. But it arouses a particular anger because the alleged shooter is an Afghan man who was granted refuge in the US. after the Taliban takeover in 2021.""It added: “The alleged shooting by an Afghan ‘partner’ shouldn’t condemn all who assisted the US and now live here. Some will say this means the U.S. should never admit such refugees, but the alternative is abandoning allies who assist Americans in war to the retribution of our enemies.The fate of Afghans, men and women, who worked with the US has often been brutal. You can be sure Americans will fight overseas again, and our troops will need allies on the ground to succeed. How many will assist us if they believe there will be no exit for them if the US leaves with the enemy triumphant?”Trump Jr. responded on X: “Give me a f***ing break. The RINOs at the Wall Street Journal Editorial Board want us to be flooded with millions of America-hating migrants who don’t share our values.”He attacked some Republicans as well: “This is a good reminder that it’s not just Democrats responsible for this – It’s the globalist RINOs too.”RINO stands for “Republican in name only.”Trump Jr has long aligned himself with his father’s hardline stance on immigration.WSJ’s editorial board has published various pieces critical of high-profile figures within the MAGA movement, according to Mediaite",The Wall Street Journal published an op-ed defending Afghan refugees living in the United States.

'Zero Americans are named Raja Krishnamoorthi'





Indian-origin Democratic Congressman (Illinois) Raja Krishnamoorthi was criticized for reintroducing an Act that he proposed earlier to increase the number of H-1B visas available each year. The move was called 'vicious' and 'tone-deaf' on social media as the administration is dealing with a major H-1B controversy after President Donald Trump said America needs certain talents but MAGA doesn't agree.The High-Skilled Immigration Reform for Employment (HIRE) Act proposes to increase the number of available H-1B visas from 65,000 to 130,000. The proposal says this would ensure US employers, including those in critical and emerging technology sectors, can recruit the specialized talent needed to fill persistent workforce shortages.To shield itself from criticism, the bill also directs new funding to strengthen STEM programs in US schools.“To build the jobs and industries of tomorrow, America must stay at the forefront of innovation by strengthening our own workforce while continuing to welcome top talent from around the globe,” Krishnamoorthi said. “The HIRE Act advances both goals by boosting STEM education in our elementary and secondary schools and by expanding the annual supply of H-1B visas from 65,000 to 130,000.By growing our domestic talent pipeline and ensuring employers can recruit the skilled workers they need, we can create good-paying jobs and secure America’s leadership in the technologies of the future. ”Social media users called for Krishnamoorthi's deportation as they claimed that he should not be in Congress if he is serving India. ""Zero Americans are named Raja Krishnamoorthi. Deport that man,"" one wrote. Another called him 'Raja Krishnamoorthi of New Delhi'. Social media users also reacted as to why he was so interested in H-1B as there are no large tech companies in Illinois.Krishnamoorthi's bill is supported by ITServe Alliance, the nation’s largest association of IT services firms. “The HIRE Act is an important step toward modernizing our high-skilled immigration system and ensuring that talented professionals can continue to contribute to America’s innovation economy,"" governing board chair of ITServe Alliance Raghu Chittimalla said",Indian-origin Democratic Congressman (Illinois) Raja Krishnamoorthi was criticized for reintroducing an Act that he proposed earlier to increase the number of H-1B visas available each year.

“It’s true, women do need to get married ... Women are happier when they’re married. … It’s just biologically and literally true.”

“They are going to flood the zone and might --- you might go out to dinner, go see a movie and come back to a bunch of illegals sitting in your living room, and it will then become their home.”

“I will say that for future retirees, people under the age of 45, we should absolutely raise the retirement age. I'm going to say something very provocative. I'm not a fan of retirement. I don't think retirement is biblical.”

“Gay marriage happens and we're talking about gay stuff more than any other time. Why? Because they are not happy just having marriage. Instead, they now want to corrupt your children.”

“I can’t stand the word empathy. Empathy is a made up new age term that does a lot of damage”

“Happening all the time in urban America, prowling Blacks go around for fun to go target white people, that’s a fact. It’s happening more and more.”

“Why else would you want to have two dudes or two women kissing in a Disney film? What is the agenda? To expose them to it or to increase the ranks of the LGBTQ community?”

“Not being able to get access to loans, or go into school, because you're white. Happening. Active discrimination is happening all across the country in the third stage of genocide.”

“Taylor Swift, I think she put up one voter registration link and she registered millions and millions and let's just be honest, all the Swifties want is swift abortion. That's what they want. It's 100%.”

Trump Goes Nuclear On 3rd World Nations After National Guard Trooper Killed | ‘US Pausing Migration’





: In an explosive tirade following the death on Thursday of a National Guard soldier in a terrorist attack near the White House, US President Donald Trump vowed to “permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries,” launch mass deportations, and even denaturalize immigrants deemed incompatible with “Western Civilization” taking a country built on immigration into uncharted territory.In two angry posts on social media, Trump essayed a sweeping indictment of bipartisan U.S immigration policy of decades, using sketchy statistics to lay out the contours of a “reverse migration,” including revoking citizenship from those who “undermine domestic tranquility.”The President’s screed came even as the USCIS issued new guidelines to reevaluate green cards issued to people from 19 nations including Afghanistan, the country from which a former CIA conscript, Rahatullah Lakanwal, attacked two U.S military personnel three blocks from the White House on Wednesday, shooting them at close range. One of them, Sarah Brackman, 20, died in hospital on Thanksgiving, triggering the President into a furious rant on immigration.The other countries in the USCIS “blacklist”, which will consider new guidance allowing for negative, country-specific factors to be considered when vetting foreigners, include Burma, Somalia, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Sudan, Yemen, Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.Taken with the President’s warning on social media, the new guidelines, which may be implemented through executive order if it cannot be legislated, will go far beyond Trump’s first-term travel ban on several majority-Muslim nations, representing the most sweeping immigration restriction in modern American history.Trump anchored his case against immigration in a series of dodgy statistical assertions, including claiming most of the 53 million foreign born population in the US “are on welfare, from failed nations, or from prisons, mental institutions, gangs, or drug cartels.” He also claimed that a green-card holder earning $30,000 receives “roughly $50,000 in yearly benefits for their family.”The assertion that “most” immigrants are on welfare or come from criminal backgrounds has been repeatedly debunked in all but extreme MAGA circles which cotton on to stray cases. Undocumented immigrants are ineligible for nearly all federal benefits, and legal immigrants face a five-year waiting period for programs such as Medicaid and SNAP (food stamps). A 2024 Congressional Budget Office report found that immigrants as a whole contribute $1.6 trillion more in taxes than they consume over a 75-year horizon when second- and third-generation effects are included. In fact, studies have shown the US needs immigration to keep its social security programs solvent.But Trump maintained that even as the US has progressed technologically, immigration policy has eroded those gains and living conditions for many. “I will permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the US. system to fully recover, terminate all of the millions of Biden illegal admissions… and remove anyone who is not a net asset to the United States, or is incapable of loving our Country, end all Federal benefits and subsidies to noncitizens of our Country, denaturalize migrants who undermine domestic tranquility, and deport any Foreign National who is a public charge, security risk, or non-compatible with Western Civilization….Only REVERSE MIGRATION can fully cure this situation,” he wrote.The President singled out the state of Minnesota, which has a prominent Somali community due to resettlement going back to the Clinton era after the civil war in that country. He alleged that “hundreds of thousands of refugees from Somalia are completely taking over” the state causing social dysfunction, with “Somalian gangs… roving the streets” while residents cower behind locked doors.Demographers place the Somali-ancestry population between 64,000 and 80,000, and while there is documented gang violence involving a small sub-set of Somali-American youth – like with Canadian Sikhs in Vancouver – their entrepreneurship has contributed significantly to the local economy.Trump reserved particular venom for Minnesota's Democratic Governor Tim Walz, whom he called “seriously retarded,” and Somali-American Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, whom he accused of entering the country illegally by marrying her brother and of hating America. The brother-marriage allegation, first aired by anonymous online posters in 2016, was investigated by Minnesota journalists and found to rest on mistaken identity and forged documents; no charges were ever filed. Omar, who arrived as a child refugee in 1992 and was naturalized in 2000, is one of three Muslim women currently serving in Congress.","USCIS issued new guidelines to reevaluate green cards issued to people from 19 nations including Afghanistan, the country from which a former CIA conscript, Rahatullah Lakanwal, attacked two U.S military personnel three blocks from the White House on Wednesday.

‘Hitler-era repression’: Imran Khan’s sister slams jail treatment; family barred from meetings,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/hitler-era-repression-imran-khans-sister-slams-jail-treatment-family-barred-from-meetings/articleshow/125623777.cms,"'Darkest Times': Imran Khan's Sister Calls Out Pakistan Govt, Compares Asim Munir To Adolf Hitler





Imran Khan’s sister, Noreen Niazi, has criticized Pakistani authorities over the treatment of the former prime minister in prison, warning that his family has been kept completely in the dark and that “no one knows what’s happening inside the jail. ”Speaking to ANI about her last meeting with the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder, she said, “...He is going through a tough time alone. He is in isolation... As per the jail manual, one can't be placed in isolation for more than 4 days. But he was put in isolation for three weeks last year as well, during which electricity was switched off, and he wasn't even allowed to read books. The same has been done now.”Her remarks come amid a surge of rumours about Khan’s health, fuelled by the month-long blackout on family and legal meetings. “We don't know anything. They are not telling us anything, nor are they letting anybody meet him,” she said, adding that even party members with a scheduled meeting had been blocked from entering.“We have not been allowed to meet him for the last four weeks... The Police have been ordered to stop us and, I believe, also given permission to do to us whatever they want. This has never happened in Pakistan before.”Niazi described the treatment of supporters and family members outside Adiala Jail as unprecedented.“No one has ever disrespected women like this, nor has anyone been oppressed this way. This is the first time in Pakistan that these people have been allowed to beat up people like there won't be any consequences, without considering if it's a child, an elderly person, or a woman in front of them. The world is aware of what's happening in Pakistan. ”She said Pakistan had entered its “darkest period”, comparing the situation to “Hitler-era-like repression”. According to her, people are being “killed, beaten, and jailed without accountability”. The continued ban on meetings, she argues, is deliberate. “We have been going there for the last four weeks, and they are not letting us meet him. This is why such rumours are spreading.”Public anger, she warned, is reaching a breaking point. “I believe there will be a spark among people soon, and then they will see the level to which the people go... The oppression is too much.”Her comments come as PTI leaders, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, continue to be denied access to Khan, who has been held since August 2023. While Adiala Jail officials insist he is in “completely good health”, the lack of transparency has only intensified demands for a clear and verifiable update on his condition.","Noreen Niazi says family has been kept in the dark about Imran Khan's condition.

The UAE has stopped issuing visas to Pakistani nationals and only narrowly held back from imposing a complete ban on the Pakistani passport, a senior Pakistani interior ministry official told a parliamentary panel on Thursday.Pakistan’s additional interior secretary Salman Chaudhry informed the Senate Functional Committee on Human Rights that both the UAE and Saudi Arabia had “stopped short of imposing a ban on the Pakistani passport,” as reported by Dawn.“If a ban is imposed, getting it removed would be difficult,” Chaudhry said.Senator Samina Mumtaz Zehri, who chairs the Senate human rights committee, confirmed the interior ministry official’s account in comments to the paper.She said the travel restrictions stemmed from concerns about individuals visiting the UAE and “getting involved in criminal activities”.According to her, the committee was informed that the UAE had largely stopped issuing visas to Pakistani nationals, and that only a limited number had been granted recently, and “after much difficulty”.A Pakistani blue passport is an official travel document reserved for government officials and other eligible personnel, distinguishing it from the standard green passport issued to ordinary citizens.Meanwhile, UAE Ambassador to Pakistan Salem M Salem Al Bawab Al Zaabi briefed Pakistan's finance minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Thursday about “major UAE visa facilitation reforms for Pakistanis,” according to a statement from the minister’s office.The statement added that nearly 500 visas were being processed daily at the newly launched UAE Visa Centre in Pakistan, outlining the reforms highlighted by the envoy.Pakistan and the UAE maintain longstanding diplomatic, economic, and cultural ties. The Gulf nation is among Pakistan’s largest trading partners in the region and a key source of remittances, supported by a sizeable Pakistani workforce residing there.However, Pakistani nationals experienced a surge in visa rejections in early July, prompting interior minister Mohsin Naqvi to take up the matter with his UAE counterpart.","The UAE has stopped issuing visas to Pakistani nationals, a senior Pakistani interior ministry official told a parliamentary panel on Thursday.

IMF Applauds India’s Growth And Reforms, Bails Pakistan Again Out From Economic Burden

(With ANI inputs)





State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) governor Jameel Ahmad has warned that the country’s existing economic growth model “can no longer sustain” its population of 250 million (25 crore).“Our business cycles are shortening and as such, our current growth model simply cannot sustain a country of over 250 million people,” he remarked at the Pakistan Business Council’s Dialogue on the Economy on Wednesday, according to The Express Tribune.Ahmad, who has led the SBP since August 2022, noted that Pakistan’s growth trajectory had been “steadily weakening for decades” — slipping from an average of 3.9 per cent over the past 30 years, to 3.5 per cent in the last two decades, and further down to 3.4 per cent over the past five years.He added that Pakistan had been caught in a “prolonged phase of stabilisation,” during which, he said, citizens and businesses were burdened by steep taxes, high energy costs and unchecked government spending. He urged policymakers and private-sector leaders to move away from short-term fixes and adopt a long-term outlook.Calling the moment an “inflection point,” Ahmad pushed for a shift towards inclusive, sustainable growth, advocating structural reforms and urging businesses to expand their competitiveness by integrating into global value chains, modernising production, and avoiding “shortcuts” for quick profits.Ahmad also highlighted that Pakistan’s external debt nearly doubled from $55 billion to $100 billion between 2015 and 2022 without a corresponding rise in reserves. Since 2022, however, public external debt has remained broadly unchanged while SBP’s reserves have climbed from $2.9 billion to $14.5 billion, aided by $8.4 billion in market purchases during the last fiscal year.His remarks came a day after Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal blamed the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for Pakistan’s highest unemployment rate in 21 years. Unemployment has risen to 7.1 per cent, while the World Bank estimates 44.7 per cent of Pakistanis now live below the poverty line.","State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) governor Jameel Ahmad has warned that the country’s existing economic growth model “can no longer sustain” its population of 250 million (25 crore) Ahmad said Pakistan had been caught in a “prolonged phase of stabilisation,” during which, he said, citizens and businesses were burdened by steep taxes, high energy costs and unchecked government spending.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125617122,imgsize-60374,width-400,resizemode-4/pakistan39s-current-growth-model-cannot-sustain-250-million-population-says-state-bank-governor.jpg"

A young Pakistani woman, missing for 17 years, has been reunited with her family with the help of facial recognition technology and AI.Kiran, now 27, went missing in 2008 when she stepped out to buy ice cream in her Islamabad neighbourhood and forgot her home address. “I was lost and crying.

Pakistan's Adiala Jail Issues Statement On Imran Khan's Health Amid Viral Death Rumours





The Adiala Jail administration on Wednesday dismissed rumours and confirmed that former Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan remains inside the Rawalpindi prison and is in good health.This comes amid growing speculation regarding the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder’s whereabouts.“There is no truth to reports about his transfer from Adiala Jail,” officials said in a statement. They added that Khan was “fully healthy and receiving complete medical attention.”The authorities further rejected the claims about any deterioration in his condition, calling it “baseless,” according to Geo TV.The clarification comes at a time when social media has been flooded with unverified claims, including suggestions from accounts based in Pakistan and Afghanistan alleging that Khan had been harmed or killed inside the prison.Khan has been behind bars since August 2023 and faces several cases, including corruption and terrorism-related charges. The accusations were filed after he was ousted from office through a no-confidence vote in April 2022.Meanwhile, defence minister Khawaja Asif claimed that the former premier was being kept in conditions far more comfortable than those faced by previous prisoners.“Check the menu of the food that comes for him — it is not available even in a five-star hotel,” Asif said.He added that Khan had access to a television, exercise equipment, a double bed and a velvet mattress, according to Geo TV.Recalling his own incarceration, he said, “We slept on cold floors, ate jail food, and had only two blankets in January with no hot water,” accusing PTI leaders of exaggerating Khan’s condition.“Fear God — no one owns time,” the defence minister added.The rumours intensified after Khan’s three sisters were allegedly assaulted by police personnel outside Adiala Jail last week while trying to meet him.Noreen Niazi, one of the sisters, said they were peacefully protesting concerns over Khan’s health when streetlights were “abruptly switched off,” followed by what she described as a “brutal and orchestrated assault.”""We peacefully protested over concerns for his health condition. We neither blocked roads nor obstructed public movement, nor engaged in any unlawful conduct. Yet, without warning or provocation, the streetlights in the area were abruptly switched off, deliberately casting the scene into darkness. What followed was a brutal and orchestrated assault by Punjab police personnel,” Noreen Niazi said.“At the age of 71, I was seized by my hair, thrown violently to the ground, and dragged across the road, sustaining visible injuries,” she added.Thousands of PTI supporters later gathered outside the facility, demanding permission to meet Khan and protesting against restrictions imposed by the government, which has reportedly barred visits to the former prime minister for over a month.Earlier, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Sohail Afridi was also denied multiple requests to meet Khan, a decision the PTI alleges is influenced by security forces.",Pakistan's Adiala Jail Issues Statement On Imran Khan's Health Amid Viral Death Rumours.

Key findings





Institutional weaknesses





Context and IMF programmes









The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned that persistent corruption and “state capture” in Pakistan are at the root of its ongoing economic crisis, where public policy is manipulated to benefit a narrow circle of political and business elites.The findings are part of the Governance and Corruption Diagnostic Assessment (GCDA), finalised in November 2025 and requested by the Pakistani government. The 186-page report paints a grim picture of dysfunctional institutions unable to enforce the rule of law or safeguard public resources, reported AljazeeraAccording to the IMF, corruption in Pakistan is “persistent and corrosive”, distorting markets, eroding public trust, and undermining fiscal stability. The report warns that without dismantling structures of “elite privilege”, economic stagnation will continue.“Failure of implementation [of laws and principles of accountability] gives vested interests too often free rein and addressing this must be at the core of efforts for economic reform,” said Stefan Dercon, professor of economic policy at the University of Oxford.The GCDA highlights that corruption is most damaging when privileged entities exert influence over key economic sectors, including state-owned or affiliated industries.The IMF estimates that tax exemptions and subsidies to such entities drain billions annually, limiting private sector growth.Ali Hasanain, associate professor at Lahore University of Management Sciences, said the IMF’s conclusions are consistent with prior domestic and international studies.“Powerful interests shape rules to maintain their advantage,” Hasanain told Al Jazeera, noting similar findings in a 2021 UNDP report.The report estimates that Pakistan could achieve 5–6.5 per cent GDP growth over five years by implementing governance reforms. Pakistan’s GDP stood at $340 billion in 2024.The IMF identifies the special investment facilitation council (SIFC) and public sector entities as major areas of concern. The SIFC, formed in June 2023 to promote investment, operates with limited transparency and legal accountability. The report urges the council to publish annual investment reports and details of concessions granted.The judiciary and key anti-corruption bodies like the national accountability bureau (NAB) and federal investigation agency (FIA) are also flagged. The judiciary faces over two million pending cases, while selective accountability by NAB has damaged public trust. Despite recovering 5.3 trillion rupees ($17 billion) in 2023–24, NAB’s low conviction rates remain a concern.The GCDA criticises recent constitutional amendments that created a parallel Federal Constitutional Court, warning that they could increase executive influence over judicial appointments.Pakistan has turned to the IMF 25 times since 1958. The current programme, initiated under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, is a 37-month, $7 billion arrangement, with a $1.2 billion tranche expected next month. The country narrowly avoided default in 2023.The report underscores that state capture and elite privilege—through tax exemptions, regulatory capture, and subsidies—remain systemic challenges. Implementing reforms, the IMF argues, could significantly restore economic growth, fiscal stability, and public trust.","Pakistan has turned to the IMF 25 times since 1958.

Five phases of cross-border terror: 1947–2025



Phase I (1947–1971): Foundational conflicts





Phase II (1972–1989): Proxy warfare





Phase III (1990–2000): Urban terror expands





Phase IV (2001–2009): National symbols targeted



Phase V (2010–2025): Adaptive terrorism and stronger Indian response



India’s resilience



NEW DELHI: A report released on Wednesday by NatStrat, a Delhi-based strategic affairs think tank, claims that Pakistan has used terrorism as a state instrument against India since 1947, with cross-border operations evolving through five distinct phases over nearly eight decades. The release coincided with the 17th anniversary of the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks.The study, titled ‘Chronology of Pakistani Terror Attacks on India: 1947–2025’, says records since Independence indicate a “consistent strategy” by Pakistan’s military and intelligence establishment, particularly the inter-services intelligence (ISI), to deploy terrorism as part of its policy framework.""The history of Pakistan-sponsored terrorism against India needs to be told and retold,"" the NatStrat compilation states.The report categorises the trajectory of Pakistan-origin terrorism into five periods - foundational conflicts (1947–71), the rise of proxy warfare (1972–89), escalation and urban attacks (1990–2000), targeting national symbols (2001–09), and adaptive terrorism with hardened Indian responses (2010–25).The period begins with the Poonch uprising and the tribal invasion of Jammu & Kashmir in 1947–48, followed by Operation Gibraltar (1965) and Operation Chengiz KhanPakistan’s pre-emptive strike in 1971.India’s counteroffensive culminated in the surrender of 93,000 Pakistani troops and the creation of Bangladesh.The report recounts plane hijackings, targeted killings - including the 1984 murder of diplomat Ravindera Mhatre - and ISI backing the Khalistan movement. The hijackings of Indian Airlines flights in 1971 and 1984 are cited as early examples of Pakistan’s covert strategy.Pakistan-backed groups, including Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), escalated militancy in J&K through the K2 project. Major urban attacks included the 1993 Mumbai serial blasts, 1996 Lajpat Nagar blast, 1998 Coimbatore bombings, the 1999 Kargil intrusion, and the IC-814 hijacking.Key attacks in this era include the 2001 Parliament attack, 2002 Akshardham temple assault, the 2005 Delhi blasts, 2006 Mumbai train bombings, and the 26/11 Mumbai attacks, which killed 166 and brought India-Pakistan ties to a breaking point.The report tracks attacks like the 2010 German Bakery blast, 2016 Pathankot and Uri attacks, and 2019 Pulwama bombing. It also lists recent incidents, including the 2025 Pahalgam attack, claimed by ‘The Resistance Front,’ and India’s retaliatory Operation Sindoor , which defence minister Rajnath Singh described as treating “any attack on Indian soil as an act of war.”The report stresses that cross-border terror has not deterred India’s progress. ""They have not stopped India's march as a nation. Instead, Indian society and polity have pushed back attempts to divide the country or slow down its progress,"" it notes.Calling terrorism an affront to humanity, the report says state-backed terrorism poses a grave threat to global stability.""It is a scourge that affects the whole world and must be fought unitedly, without reservation or double standards.""NatStrat is convened by Pankaj Saran, a former diplomat with four decades of experience, who has served in the prime minister’s office, national security council secretariat, and as India’s envoy to Russia and Bangladesh. He also served as deputy national security adviser.The compilation is dedicated to victims of terrorism and those who have fought against it, offering a detailed account of what it calls Pakistan’s “decades-long hybrid warfare” and India’s evolving response.(With inputs from agencies)",Report claims Pakistan has used terrorism as a state instrument against India since 1947.

The missile can engage both sea and land targets with high accuracy and incorporates advanced guidance systems along with improved manoeuvrability,"" the ISPR noted.""President Asif Ali Zardari, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee General Sahir Shamshad Mirza, and the heads of the armed forces congratulated the teams of scientists, engineers, and operational units involved,"" it added.Separately, a Pakistan Navy spokesperson highlighted that the launch underscored the country’s ""growing technological capacity"" and reaffirmed the service’s commitment to safeguarding national interests.Pakistan has been stepping up efforts to expand its defence capabilities since the May conflict with India, which came to a halt following a ceasefire request by Islamabad. In September, the Pakistan Army conducted a training launch of the newly developed Fatah-4 — a ground-launched cruise missile with a range of 750 kilometres.The ISPR has described the Fatah-4 as equipped with advanced avionics and navigational aids and capable of evading missile-defence systems through low-altitude, terrain-hugging flight, ensuring high-precision strikes.India’s political and military leadership have repeatedly warned Pakistan of consequences “more serious than during Operation Sindoor"" - the four-day conflict - in the event of any “misadventure” by the neighbouring country.","Pakistan has been stepping up efforts to expand its defence capabilities since the May conflict with India.

NEW DELHI: Direct flights between Pakistan and Bangladesh will start next month, marking a significant boost to connectivity between the two countries, Bangladesh’s ambassador to Pakistan announced on Wednesday.There have been no direct air links for several years between the two, which were part of one country - Pakistan - until 1971. Bangladesh — formerly East Pakistan — became independent after the India-Pakistan war of December 1971. Bilateral relations, long shaped by this history, have begun to improve notably since the 2024 ouster of then-Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.“Mahan Air will begin operating three weekly flights between Dhaka and Karachi from next month,” Bangladesh’s High Commissioner to Pakistan, Iqbal Hussain Khan said. Dhaka is Bangladesh’s capital and largest city, while Karachi is Pakistan’s biggest metropolis; both rank among the world’s most populated urban centres.Khan did not specify the exact launch date or share further operational details.He also highlighted that the visa process has been simplified. “Visas are now being issued on the joint recommendation of Lahore Chamber of Commerce & Industry (LCCI) and the Bangladesh Honorary Consulate in Lahore,” he noted.Travellers can expect visas within three to four days, he added, describing the change as a step that will make cross-border movement faster and more convenient.The envoy emphasised that the new air links “will be a significant leap in strengthening connectivity between the two countries.”Mahan Airlines, which operates as Mahan Air, is a privately owned Iranian carrier. In addition, two Pakistani private airlines — Fly Jinnah and AirSial — have already received approval from Bangladesh’s aviation authorities to commence direct flights.Khan also disclosed that a direct cargo shipping service will be launched soon. “Although a cargo service has been operational since last December, rising trade volumes now demand a dedicated direct route,” he explained.Relations between the two countries have warmed in recent months. Following the August 5, 2024 ouster of Sheikh Hasina amid widespread student-led protests, and the appointment of Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus as Chief Adviser of the interim government, Dhaka and Islamabad have increased engagement across multiple fronts."," direct flights between Pakistan and Bangladesh will start next month.

TL;DR Driving the news

'Necessary Response At Proper Time': Taliban Vows Action After 10 Killed In Pak Strikes

What changed: The 27th Amendment





Passed in five days without broad consultation, the amendment:

Created a new Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) - removing constitutional jurisdiction from the Supreme Court.

Gave the president power to transfer judges - effectively coercing judicial loyalty.

Handed lifetime immunity to the president and military chiefs - beyond the reach of courts.

Eliminated the post of Chairman Joint Chiefs and established a Chief of Defence Forces - placing all services under Field Marshal Asim Munir.

Why it matters





A civilian-military consolidation of power unseen since the days of General Pervez Musharraf.

The official death of judicial independence, according to resigning justices and legal experts.

A reshuffling of Pakistan's political DNA - where the army writes the script, judges act the scenes, and a veiled mystic, Bushra Bibi , remains a ghost in the wings.

, remains a ghost in the wings. “We are facing completely uncharted territory,” warned constitutional lawyer Asad Rahim Khan.

The big picture: A triangle of power





Field Marshal Asim Munir: commander of all armed services, architect of the new order.

Imran Khan: jailed, disqualified, but symbolically invincible.

Bushra Bibi: spiritual advisor-turned-political wife, whose journey from Pakpattan to Islamabad may yet reshape the battlefield.

Together - or more accurately, against each other - they define Pakistan’s struggle between civilian populism, military dominance, and spiritual mysticism.

The new triumvirate: The general, the pirni & the cricketer





Asim Munir: The new pharaoh

All armed services via the new title Chief of Defence Forces

The nuclear command (transferred from civilians)

His own legal protection, via lifetime immunity

Parliament, by proxy of pliant coalitions

“Field marshals don't retire. They may leave a post, but they remain field marshal for life.” Shuja Nawaz on Munir

Imran Khan: Popularity in captivity





His party, despite rigging, won 93 out of 266 seats in 2024 elections.

His speeches are censored, yet his words circulate like sacred scripture.

His rivals - from Shehbaz Sharif to Zardari - struggle to match his moral authority.

Bushra Bibi: The mystic in the mirror





Predicted Khan’s rise to power - prompting their 2018 secret marriage.

Selected cabinet appointments by reading photographs.

The ISI angle





Bushra behind bars





Unlawful marriage (violating the Islamic waiting period)

Saudi gifts corruption scandal

Land deal redirection for an Islamic university

Yet none of these - even when supported by leaked audios and courtroom theatrics - have cracked public perception.

“Bushra has not made herself my weakness,” Khan said from his cell. “Her bravery has made me stronger.”

Between the lines





This is not just a crisis of governance - it’s a recasting of Pakistan’s founding vision.

From constitutional democracy to executive-military command

From judicial review to judicial obedience

From public representation to spiritual symbolism

What’s next





Munir had been due to retire in 2027. Now, he is set to oversee the 2028 elections, installing loyalist judges and neutering opposition.

What if Khan compromises - freeing himself and Bushra in exchange for political silence.

Then there is the risk of popular backlash erupting-driven by youth, lawyers, and civil society.

For now, the regime holds the cards. But as with every overreach in Pakistan’s history - from Zia to Musharraf - backlash often comes not as revolution, but as decay.

Bottom line





The Field Marshal cannot be arrested

The Supreme Court cannot speak

The President cannot be questioned

And the people’s vote barely matters





On paper, the 27th Constitutional Amendment is 59 clauses of dense legalese. In practice, it reads like a character study of three people: a jailed former cricket hero, his mystic wife, and a general-turned-field marshal who now enjoys lifetime immunity.On November 14, 2025, Pakistan enacted the 27th Constitutional Amendment - a sweeping legal overhaul that granted lifetime immunity to President Asif Ali Zardari and Field Marshal Asim Munir , while transforming the judiciary into an executive-led structure.Two Supreme Court judges resigned. Opposition parties stormed out of Parliament. And somewhere in a prison cell in Adiala, Imran Khan , Pakistan’s most popular politician, began writing a letter - alone, without books or newspapers.“Parliament has done what previous dictators could only dream of,” said legal analyst Mirza Moiz Baig.“This is autocratic legalism,” warned Aqil Shah of Georgetown University. “In no other democracy is the army chief of staff the designated joint service chief,” Shah told AFP.The 27th Amendment isn’t just constitutional tinkering. It represents:In a scathing editorial, Dawn argued that “with this, the separation of powers and basic structure established by the 1973 Constitution of Pakistan - which envisioned an independent judiciary and armed forces subservient to the civilian dispensation - now stands terminated.”It noted the irony that “instead of the military, an independent judiciary has been amended away into a subservient department of the executive branch. ”“The funeral rites for the judiciary have been performed,” said the editorial.Pakistan’s new regime is no longer about parties. It’s now a triumvirate:Munir rose through the ranks as quartermaster general and Corps Commander Gujranwala, then as head of Military Intelligence and, eventually, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). In 2019 he was removed as intelligence chief “just eight months into his stint, under then-prime minister Imran Khan and for reasons that have never been made public.”That sacking is widely seen in Pakistan as the first major clash between Munir and Imran Khan.Now elevated to Field Marshal, Asim Munir controls:“He probably has as much power as Musharraf,” said military analyst Shuja Nawaz. “Like Musharraf, he has a subservient prime minister and the authority to reshape the army's structure,” Nawaz told AFP.And unlike Musharraf, Munir doesn’t wear the scars of a military coup - he wears constitutional legitimacy.Former Prime Minister Imran Khan - held in solitary confinement, his party symbol banned, and facing dozens of legal cases - still commands unmatched national support.“He is still seen as Pakistan’s moral sovereign,” noted a leading historian.But behind bars, choices are narrowing. Some in PTI want compromise. Bushra Bibi, too, is reportedly inclined toward negotiation.As per a profile of Bushra Bibi in the Economist, by the mid-2010s, Imran Khan was at a personal and political low. Then came the introduction to Bushra Manika, a middle-aged woman from Punjab with a reputation as a Sufi-inclined spiritual guide. Their relationship began with late-night phone calls, before turning into visits to her family home in Pakpattan. According to 1843, Bushra’s then-husband, Khawar Manika, initially enjoyed the glamour but became uneasy as his wife’s intimacy with Khan grew. He recalled asking: “Why can’t we sit together?” and described walking into rooms to find conversations abruptly cut short.Manika later told 1843 that his wife had shared a prophecy with Khan: if they married, he would become prime minister. She divorced Manika at the end of 2017 and married Khan in a secret ceremony on January 1st 2018. Khan later told a British newspaper, “Sufism is an order with many levels, but I have never met anyone who is as high as my wife.”As per the Economist, few first ladies in modern history have combined veiled mysticism, political access, and whispered intrigue quite like Bushra Bibi.Once a pirni from Pakpattan, she:“Her interference was absolute,” a member of Imran Khan’s cabinet told the Economist.“He cannot see beyond that Sufi halo she carries around her,” added close friend Salman Ahmad.Per the Economist’s reporting, ISI officers allegedly used a pir to funnel intelligence to Bushra, who then passed it to Khan as revelations from dreams - reinforcing her mystical power and his trust in her.“Faiz was feeding information to Bushra Bibi through her pir,” confirmed ex-ally Faisal Vawda.“That’s how Khan started getting blinded.”But what the spy agency built, it later dismantled. When Khan sacked Asim Munir as ISI chief in 2019, allegedly after he raised corruption concerns about Bushra, the seeds of retaliation were planted.Bushra Bibi now shares Khan’s fate - imprisoned, silenced, and at the center of three separate cases:“No ordinary Pakistani will remain unaffected,” Dawn warned.“When the state is tried by a court that it has hand-picked, the citizen will lose every time.”This crisis leaves Pakistan at a crossroads:This isn’t just about one amendment, or one general, or one mystic wife. It’s about a state remade in secret, then rubber-stamped in Parliament, where:But still, whispers from prison echo across Pakistan - from Khan’s letters to Bushra’s mysticism and protests.(With inputs from agencies)",The 27th Amendment to Pakistan's constitution was passed in five days without broad consultation.

Suicide Bombers Storm Pakistan’s FC Headquarters In Peshawar As Explosions Rock High-Security Zone





A coordinated attack involving suicide bombers and gunmen targeted the headquarters of the Federal Constabulary (FC) paramilitary force in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Peshawar on Monday. Rebel group Jamaat-ul-Ahrar (JuA) has claimed responsibility for the attack. While the group claimed around two dozen casualties and death of three of its fighters, Pakistani authorities said there were six deaths, including that of three soldiers.The JuA, which is comprised of soldiers from Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), was also behind the suicide bombing at a judicial complex in Islamabad a day after the blast in Delhi. Monday's operation began with a suicide bomber detonating explosives at the main entrance of the highly secured FC headquarters, a compound located in a densely populated area on Sunehri Masjid Road in Peshawar Cantonment.Following the initial blast, at least two other attackers breached the premises and engaged security forces, sources said. Several personnel and civilians were also reported injured and rushed to nearby hospitals.Over two dozen people were admitted for treatment.Peshawar capital city police officer Mian Saeed Ahmad told local media that the three personnel killed were stationed at the main gate. Ahmad claimed that the quick response of security forces resulted in the timely elimination of the remaining two attackers, preventing a potentially high casualty count as a large number of personnel were reportedly gathered inside for parade drills.A representative of JuA posted on Telegram about the attack, saying: ""Three suicide mujahideen are participating in the attack. We want the complete and 100% implementation of Sharia. If the enemy agrees to 99% but refuses even 1%, then our jihad against them will continue. Insha'Allah...""The JuA split from TTP in 2014 due to ideological differences. However, it joined hands with TTP again a few years ago. The recent resurgence in militancy has been attributed to TTP and its associated groups, including JuA.",Rebel group Jamaat-ul-Ahrar (JuA) claimed responsibility for the attack.

Cyclone Ditwah Approaches India: Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Andhra Pradesh Brace For Impact





COLOMBO: Sri Lanka on Friday grappled with one of its worst disasters as cyclonic storm Ditwah wreaked havoc, causing floods and landslides that left more than 80 dead, amid a trail of destruction and damage to infrastructure.India launched 'Operation Sagar Bandhu' to assist Sri Lanka in its hour of crisis, and the first tranche of relief materials was handed over after the consignments were transported by the Indian Navy's aircraft carrier INS Vikrant and frontline ship INS Udaigiri to the island nation.The relief came as Sri Lankan authorities warned of an ""unprecedented disaster situation"" in the Western Province from Friday night due to rising water levels in the Kelani and Attanagalu rivers.Both Colombo and the next most populous district of Gampaha are under severe threat, prompting officials to urge residents in vulnerable areas to evacuate, they said.Late on Friday, the Disaster Management Centre (DMC) confirmed more than 80 people have died, while 34 remain missing in the past three days, as rescue operations intensify, according to news portal NewsFirst.lk.The DMC said as many as 1,48,603 individuals from 44,192 families were suffering due to widespread flooding, while 5,024 families (approximately 14,000 people) had taken shelter in 195 emergency centres.Scores of houses were destroyed completely or partially, leaving thousands homeless as Cyclone Ditwah unleashed torrential rainfall, triggering extensive flooding, landslides in central hill regions and major disruptions in other parts that have left several areas inaccessible.""It is unlikely this situation will change. We expect the Kelani River's water levels to exceed those recorded during the 2016 floods,"" Director General Ajith Gunasekara told reporters.He urged residents in vulnerable locations to secure essential items, including educational certificates, vehicle documents and valuables, before relocating to safer ground.The central Matale district recorded the highest rainfall in the 24 hours ending 6 am Thursday, receiving 540 mm, authorities said.Three major bridges - Moragahakanda Main Bridge, Elahera Bridge, and Kumara Ella Bridge - were washed away, cutting off vital transport routes and isolating communities in Matale, Polonnaruwa, Kurunegala, and Uva provinces, all routes crucial for trade, agriculture, and relief convoys.The disaster management officials said that the severity of the weather has significantly hindered the ability of officials to reach affected sites or carry out on-ground assessments and rescue efforts.The Irrigation Department issued a further warning that the Kelani river is approaching historically high flood levels, posing a severe risk to Colombo and surrounding areas for the next two days, the news portal said.Severe weather has also caused widespread power outages, affecting 25 to 30 per cent of the region.Two major hydropower plants, Kotmale and Rantambe, were shut down after a power cable failure, said Shirley Kumara, general manager of the Ceylon Electricity Board.As of 5:30 pm Friday, the cyclonic storm Ditwah lay centred about 40 kilometres west-northwest of Trincomalee in eastern Sri Lanka, officials said, adding, it was moving north-northwest, dumping massive rainfall.The Indian High Commission, in a statement, said New Delhi has so far provided 4.5 tonnes of dry rations and 2 tonnes of fresh rations, including staple foods, packaged and ready-to-eat items, dairy and bakery products, beverages, and other nutritional essentials.Additional survival supplies have also been handed over, it said.Meanwhile, the National Building Research Organisation (NBRO) described the current situation as ""extraordinary and unprecedented"" and warned that landslides could occur at any moment in any mountainous region due to the prevailing severe weather conditions.The director of the NBRO's Landslide Research Division told local media that landslides can occur when rainfall exceeds 150 mm within 24 hours. ""Several mountainous areas have (already) received more than 500 mm of rainfall during the past 24 hours,"" he said on Friday afternoon.""The total rainfall during the past 10 days is close to 1,000 mm. This situation is unlike anything we have ever experienced,"" he said.Earlier in the day, a diplomatic briefing was held at the Prime Minister Harini Amarasuriya's office, and attended by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Foreign Employment and Tourism, Vijitha Herath.The Colombo-based Heads of Mission were updated on the Sri Lankan government's ongoing emergency flood relief operations and recovery measures, and they were told that the government has designated an officer to handle inquiries regarding foreign tourists affected by the current disaster situation, according to the PM's Office.According to local media, several important examinations were postponed due to the precarious flood situation, authorities announced.In response to the disaster caused by Cyclone Ditwah, President Dissanayake invoked powers under the Essential Public Services Act, declaring a wide range of services as ""essential"" to the life of the community reeling under severe adverse weather conditions.These services include electricity supply; supply or distribution of petroleum products, fuel, including gas; hospitals, water supply, and public transport.All long-distance express, intercity, and night mail trains on every railway line were cancelled, with several train services resuming on Friday evening only within the Western Province, according to railway authorities.","India launches 'Operation Sagar Bandhu' to assist Sri Lanka in its hour of crisis.

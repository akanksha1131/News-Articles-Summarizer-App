Serbia protest: Anti-government unrest escalates for third night of clashes — see video,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/serbia-protest-anti-government-unrest-escalates-for-third-night-of-clashes-see-video/articleshow/123315522.cms,"



At least 42 police officers, including 26 in Belgrade, were injured after a Clash erupted between rival groups of protesters in Serbia, as months of anti-governmental demonstrations boiled over into street violence for a second night, Tass news agency reported.A wave of anti-corruption protests has gripped Serbia since November, following the collapse of the Novi Sad railway station roof that killed 16 people, a tragedy widely blamed on entrenched corruption.Protesters gathered again in several cities across Serbia late on Wednesday, mainly in response to an attack by ruling party supporters on demonstrators in the town of Vrbas, about 160 km north of the capital, Belgrade. For the second night running, large groups of pro-government supporters, most wearing masks, confronted protesters.The two groups hurled bottles, stones and fireworks at each other. Police arrested nearly 50 people across the country. The worst violence was reported in parts of Belgrade and Novi Sad, where the protest movement first began. One man, later identified as a military police officer, fired a pistol into the air as protesters approached the ruling party’s offices in Novi Sad, causing panic, as per Guardian.Footage also appeared to show supporters of the ruling Serbian Progressive Party launching fireworks at protesters gathered outside the party’s headquarters there. Police intervened with teargas, and stun grenades could also be heard.Frustrated with government inaction, protesters demanded an investigation into the Novi Sad tragedy and piled pressure on the Serbian president, Aleksandar Vucic, to call early elections. Over the past nine months, thousands of mostly peaceful, student-led demonstrations have been held, some attracting hundreds of thousands.This week’s violence, however, marked a significant escalation and indicated the increasing strain on Vucic’s populist government, in power for 13 years. Since June 28, when about 140,000 demonstrators gathered in Belgrade, the government has responded with an “intensifying crackdown” on activists, according to a statement by UN human rights experts released earlier this month.Protesters and those linked to the movement had faced a “troubling pattern of repression” including excessive police force, intimidation and arbitrary arrest, the experts said. Vucic has remained defiant, repeatedly rejecting calls for early elections and denouncing the demonstrations as part of a foreign plot to overthrow him.After the Novi Sad shooting incident, officials confirmed the man was a member of a special military police unit usually tasked with protecting government ministers, Guardian reported.He had fired his weapon while “on a routine assignment when attacked by about 100 people”, officials said. The officer told journalists on Thursday: “I used my firearm and fired a shot into the air in a safe direction.At that moment, the attackers scattered.” Footage widely shared online showed a man wearing a black T-shirt and no clear military insignia pointing a pistol into the air near protesters. Military officials said that seven members of the same military police unit had been injured while on duty to “protect a specific person”, but gave no further details.Student protesters accused the police of protecting pro-government supporters while doing little to stop the attacks on their own gatherings. “The authorities tried to provoke a civil war last night,” the students wrote on their official Instagram page.They announced further protests for Thursday night. Vucic, who visited pro-government encampments overnight, denied his supporters had started the violence. “No one attacked them anywhere,” he said of the anti-government protesters, speaking at a late-night press conference.“They went everywhere to attack those who think differently.” While the protests have so far led to the resignation of the prime minister and the collapse of his cabinet, Vucic remains at the helm of a reshuffled government.","Protesters gathered again in several cities across Serbia late on Wednesday, mainly in response to an attack by ruling party supporters on demonstrators in the town of Vrbas.

Trump's crackdown on crime in Washington: DEA head appointed as ‘emergency police commissioner'; granted full powers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-crackdown-on-crime-in-washington-dea-head-appointed-as-emergency-police-commissioner-granted-full-powers/articleshow/123315025.cms,"



US Attorney General Pam Bondi has appointed Terry Cole, the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), as Washington’s “emergency police commissioner,” granting him the powers of the police chief amid the federal takeover.On Thursday, Bondi , in a directive notice, said that Cole will assume “powers and duties vested in the District of Columbia Chief of Police.”She added that the Metropolitan Police Department “must receive approval from Commissioner Cole” before issuing any orders, AP reported.The Attorney General has rescinded a directive issued by Pamela Smith, the city's current police chief, that required MPD officers to share information with immigration agencies concerning individuals not in custody, such as those involved in traffic stops or checkpoints.Bondi stated that she was revoking that order along with other MPD policies that limited inquiries into immigration status and prevented arrests based solely on federal immigration warrants.""All new directives must now receive approval from Cole,"" the Attorney General said.The late-night announcement followed an eventful day in the ongoing federal operation. Smith's earlier directive effectively aligned Trump's initiatives on city law enforcement with his nationwide efforts to curb immigration, and Trump had commended it in the hours preceding Bondi's declaration.“That’s a very positive thing, I have heard that just happened,” Trump said of Smith’s order. “That’s a great step. That’s a great step if they’re doing that.”The police chief increased cooperation between her officers and federal immigration officials as President Donald Trump’s law enforcement takeover of the nation’s capital took root Thursday. National Guard troops watched over some of the world’s most renowned landmarks and Humvees took up position in front of the busy main train station.The White House said 45 arrests were made Wednesday night, with 29 people arrested for living in the country illegally; other arrests included for distribution or possession of drugs, carrying a concealed weapon and assaulting a federal officer.Troops were stationed outside the Union Station transportation hub as the 800 Guard members activated by Trump begin missions that include monument security, community safety patrols and beautification efforts, the Pentagon said.“They will remain until law and order has been restored in the District as determined by the president, standing as the gatekeepers of our great nation’s capital,” Pentagon press secretary Kingsley Wilson said.“The National Guard is uniquely qualified for this mission as a community-based force with strong local ties and disciplined training.”","US Attorney General Pam Bondi has appointed Terry Cole, the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, as Washington’s “emergency police commissioner,” granting him the powers of the police chief.

Air Canada attendants strike: Carrier cancels flights ahead of work stoppage — Here’s what passengers can do,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/air-canada-attendants-strike-carrier-cancels-flights-ahead-of-work-stoppage-heres-what-passengers-can-do/articleshow/123314508.cms,"Air Canada executives leave after they are interrupted by Air Canada flight attendants during a press conference as a possible strike looms, in Toronto, on Thursday, Aug. 14, 2025.

What to do if your Air Canada flight is cancelled





Air Canada began canceling flights on Thursday, ahead of a possible work stoppage by flight attendants, who issued a 72-hour strike notice, potentially impacting hundreds of thousands of travelers.A complete shutdown of the country's largest airline threatens to affect approximately 1.3 lakh people daily, A.Mark Nasr, Chief Operations Officer for Air Canada, stated the airline has begun a gradual suspension of Air Canada and Air Canada Rouge operations. “All flights will be paused by Saturday early morning,” he said.Nasr added that this approach will help facilitate an orderly restart “which under the best circumstances will take a full week to complete.”He mentioned that the initial set of cancellations, involving several dozen flights, will impact long-haul overseas flights scheduled to depart Thursday night.“By tomorrow evening we expect to have cancelled flights affecting over 1 lakh customers,” Nasr said. “By the time we get to 1 am on Saturday morning we will be completely grounded.” Nasr said the grounding will affect 25,000 Canadians daily abroad who may become stranded.They anticipate 500 flights to be cancelled by the end of Friday. He further stated that customers whose flights are cancelled will be eligible for a full refund, and the airline has arranged with other Canadian and foreign carriers to provide alternative travel options “to the extent possible.”The Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE), representing attendants nationwide, issued a strike notice, leading Air Canada to announce a 72-hour lockout effective August 16.According to the union, 99.7 per cent of its members supported the strike, which will suspend operations from Saturday until a labour agreement is reached. “For the past nine months, we have put forward solid, data-driven proposals on wages and unpaid work, all rooted in fairness and industry standards,” said Wesley Lesosky, President of the Air Canada Component of CUPE.“Air Canada’s response to our proposals makes one thing clear: they are not interested in resolving these critical issues.” The airline stated that eight months of negotiations and an offer to go to arbitration failed to produce a deal.Some flight attendants at the airline's news conference on Thursday held up signs that read “Unpaid work won't fly” and “Poverty wages = UnCanadian.”Natasha Stea, who represents flight attendants in Montreal for the union, said she thinks the airline is counting on the government to intervene. Stea said they want a fair and equitable contract.“There is still time. I'm sure if we sat down and talked we could actually get to an agreement,” she said.On August 11, it proposed a 38 per cent pay increase over four years, along with additional benefits and protections, but the union rejected the offer.John Gradek, who heads McGill University’s aviation management program, said that Canada’s Air Passenger Protection Regulations require airlines to promptly notify passengers of cancellations—via text, voicemail, or email—and outline their options, CBC reported.Typically, Air Canada must cover the cost of rebooking passengers on another airline so they arrive within 48 hours of their original scheduled time. If that’s not possible, or the alternative offered doesn’t meet the passenger’s needs, the airline must issue a refund for the unused ticket value.Expenses for hotels, meals, and other costs incurred while waiting must also be reimbursed—passengers should keep receipts and be prepared to submit them.Canadian North passengers should check how their booking was made: if the Air Canada leg was on a separate ticket, Air Canada is responsible for rebooking; if the journey was booked entirely through Canadian North, that carrier must arrange the replacement flight.","Air Canada began canceling flights on Thursday, ahead of a possible work stoppage by flight attendants.

‘Reprehensible act’: Indian temple in US vandalised; consulate seeks probe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/reprehensible-act-indian-temple-in-us-vandalised-consulate-seeks-probe/articleshow/123275155.cms,"



A Hindu temple in the United States has been vandalised, prompting condemnation from the Indian Consulate in Chicago. In a post on X, the consulate described the desecration of the main signboard of the BAPS Swaminarayan Temple in Greenwood, Indiana, as “reprehensible” and confirmed it had raised the matter with law enforcement for prompt action. The Consul General met devotees, local leaders and the Mayor of Greenwood, urging unity, solidarity and vigilance against “miscreants”.The incident comes less than 6 months after a similar act of vandalism at the BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir in Chino Hills, California. At the time, ministry of external affairs condemned the act “in the strongest terms” and urged local authorities to act swiftly and ensure security at places of worship. BAPS Public Affairs said the Hindu community would “stand steadfast against hate” and “never let hate take root”.The Coalition of Hindus of North America also linked such incidents to rising hostility towards Hindus, noting the timing ahead of a planned “Khalistan referendum” in Los Angeles. Previous attacks on BAPS temples were reported in Sacramento and New York last year, fuelling concerns over repeated targeting of Hindu places of worship across the US.","Vandalism at BAPS Swaminarayan Temple in Indiana described as'reprehensible' Indian Consul General met devotees, local leaders and the Mayor of Greenwood, urging unity, solidarity and vigilance against'miscreants' Incident comes less than 6 months after a similar act of vandalism at the BAPS Shri Swaminrayan Mandir in California.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123275239,imgsize-985007,width-400,resizemode-4/123275239.jpg"

'Treated like a criminal': New Zealand woman and 6-year-old son detained by ICE at US border; narrates 'terrifying' ordeal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/treated-like-a-criminal-new-zealand-woman-and-6-year-old-son-detained-by-ice-at-us-border-narrates-terrifying-ordeal/articleshow/123274510.cms,"Image: GoFundMe@/VictoriaBesancon





A New Zealand woman held at a US immigration center with her six-year-old son after being detained while crossing the Canada-US border is being “treated like a criminal,” said her friend and advocate, reported the Guardian.Sarah Shaw, 33, a New Zealander who has lived in Washington state for just over three years, dropped her two older children at Vancouver Airport on July 24 for them to take a direct flight to New Zealand to visit their grandparents.When she tried to re-enter US, the immigration and customs enforcement (ICE) detained her and her youngest son in what her friend Victoria Besancon described as a “terrifying” ordeal.“Sarah thought she was being kidnapped,” Besancon said, as quoted by the Guardian. “They didn’t really explain anything to her at first; they just kind of quietly took her and her son and immediately put them in like an unmarked white van.”Her phone was then confiscated, and she was transported to the Dilley immigration processing center in South Texas.Shaw is currently applying for a green card under a provision for domestic violence survivors. According to the GoFundMe page organised by Besancon, Shaw had work authorisation but had not yet received travel permission under what's known as a “combo card,” although her son had such permission.“It wasn’t until she tried to come back across the border that she realised only half of the combination card, because it’s only one physical card, had been fully approved,” Bescanson said.Meanwhile, all three of Shaw’s children have their I-360 visas approved, and Bescanson claimed that Sarah’s youngest son was therefore being held “illegally.”Minda Thorward, Shaw’s attorney, said that under the previous administrations, customs and border protection (CBP) would likely have quickly paroled her back into the country, but that approach has changed under Trump, reported NBC King 5 News.Shaw, who works for the Washington state department of children, youth, and families (DCYF), was preparing to start graduate school soon, as per the GoFundMe page.The fund, which raised over $33,000 by Monday morning, aims to cover legal fees and basic needs after Shaw depleted her savings on legal representation, reported Newsweek.“She gives therapy and counselling to some of our most at-risk youth … and to be treated like a criminal herself has just been absolutely devastating,” Bescanson said as quoted by the Guardian.Several legal US residents have been detained by ICE in the past months. While some detainees reportedly have criminal histories that might justify visa revocation, others argue that errors in paperwork led to their detention and believe they should be released.New Zealand’s foreign affairs ministry has confirmed that they are in contact with Shaw but provided no further details due to privacy concerns, reported The Guardian.","Sarah Shaw, 33, a New Zealander who has lived in Washington state for just over three years, dropped her two older children at Vancouver Airport on July 24 for them to take a direct flight to New Zealand.

'We have Tony Soparno': George Conway compares Trump to fictional character; remarks made over federal takeover of DC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/we-have-tony-soparno-george-conway-compares-trump-to-fictional-character-remarks-made-over-federal-takeover-of-dc/articleshow/123313276.cms,"Donald Trump (AP image) and George Conway (Image: X/@C_3C_3)





George Conway, a conservative and prominent critic of President Donald Trump , has compared the Republican leader to Tony Soprano, the fictional mob boss from the TV series The Sopranos. The comment came in response to Trump’s federal takeover of Washington DC.Conway and former Homeland Security official Miles Taylor appeared on MSNBC Wednesday to discuss Trump placing the DC police under federal control and deploying the National Guard. Trump said the move was in response to “out of control” crime, although data shows violent crime in DC has been declining since its peak in 2023, as reported by the Independent.Conway, who was once married to Trump's adviser Kellyanne Conway, said, “We don’t have Ronald Reagan anymore. We have Tony Soprano. He’s holding people up, threatening them, bullying them, doing things beyond his legal authority. And that scares people.”He added that Trump intimidates those he sees as opponents. “We see the intimidation of people who have had the courage, like Miles [Taylor], to speak out and criticize the president,” Conway said. “There is no limit to how low he will go, and what he will do to intimidate and to threaten and to assert power over things.”Taylor, who served as Chief of Staff at the Department of Homeland Security under Trump’s first term, wrote an anonymous 2018 op-ed titled “I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration.”In it, he said many Trump appointees aimed to protect democratic institutions while preventing Trump’s “more misguided impulses.”In April, Trump had signed an executive order targeting Taylor, revoking his security clearance and instructing the Justice Department to investigate him. His attorneys also sent letters to the justice department and Homeland Security inspectors general, requesting an investigation.Taylor described the experience as deeply disruptive.“This has not been made easy, because once you are on the president's blacklist, all sorts of things in your life start to implode, businesses, relationships, friendships, financial, you have an army of lawyers,” he told MSNBC.Conway also expressed concern about federal involvement in local law enforcement across the country. Trump indicated Wednesday that the DC move could serve as a model for cities such as New York, Chicago and Los Angeles.“I also think it's important that people understand why it is that this kind of federal overreach is bad, and it's bad because it consolidates power in a federal government. And as Americans, we have never, never wanted that to happen,” Conway said. “We've always had a federal system where local authorities handle local things like crime and safety on the streets, public safety.”He added that such federal involvement could lead to abuse since there would be limited checks.Trump has also suggested extending the federal takeover of DC police beyond the 30-day limit, which would require Congressional approval. He expects Republican support for the extension to be nearly unanimous.","Conway and former Homeland Security official Miles Taylor appeared on MSNBC Wednesday to discuss Trump placing the DC police under federal control and deploying the National Guard.

‘Take a drug test’: Donald Trump targets Elizabeth Warren; sparks Social Security debate at White House,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/take-a-drug-test-donald-trump-targets-elizabeth-warren-sparks-social-security-debate-at-white-house/articleshow/123312889.cms,"Donald Trump and Elizabeth Warren (AP images)





President Donald Trump on Thursday said that Senator Elizabeth Warren “has got to take a drug test” in response to her claims that he is trying to cut Social Security.Trump made the remarks during a White House event marking the 90th anniversary of the Social Security Act, where he pledged to strengthen the program “for generations to come.”""It's so vicious what they do. Elizabeth Warren said she was an Indian. We call her Pocahontas. She's a liar. She lied her whole career,"" Trump said. ""Based on the fact that she was an Indian, she was able to get into certain colleges, get certain jobs, get into certain universities to work there. And she's a liar and a mean person.""Trump also criticized Warren for supporting Democratic Socialist New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani . ""She's a nutjob. I watched her the other night. She's all hopped up endorsing a communist in New York City, and she was all excited and jumping up and down. She's got to take a drug test. She really, though, she's got to take a drug test. There's no way somebody can act that way and be normal.”Earlier this year, Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, wrote an op-ed for Fox News claiming that Social Security is under unprecedented attack under the Trump administration. She criticized billionaire Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Elon Musk , alleging attempts to weaken the program by firing workers, closing offices and cutting services, as reported by Fox News.Warren said that Social Security services should not be cut or Americans’ benefits threatened. She added that people are struggling with high prices while their retirement savings shrink. She called for a temporary increase in benefits to provide relief and suggested lifting the cap on contributions from millionaires and billionaires to secure the system long-term and fund permanent benefit expansion.Trump defended his administration’s approach, saying, “We've already kicked nearly 275,000 illegal aliens off of the Social Security system.""The US President said that many of these people have already left the country, yet they were still receiving Social Security checks. He added that removing them strengthens the system and contrasted with former President Joe Biden , who he claimed did not remove anyone and allowed everyone to stay on.","Trump made the remarks during a White House event marking the 90th anniversary of the Social Security Act.

ChatGPT health scare: 60-year-old man hospitalized after following AI advice- Here's why,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/chatgpt-health-scare-60-year-old-man-hospitalized-after-following-ai-advice-heres-why/articleshow/123312776.cms,".





A 60-year-old man was hospitalized for three weeks after replacing table salt with sodium bromide following advice from the AI chatbot ChatGPT.The case was detailed in a report published this month in the Annals of Internal Medicine by three physicians from the University of Washington. According to the report, the man had no prior psychiatric history when he arrived at the hospital ""expressing concern that his neighbor was poisoning him. ""He reported that he had been distilling his own water at home and appeared paranoid about the water he was offered. After lab tests and consultation with poison control, doctors found high levels of bromide in the body, as reported by NBC News.""In the first 24 hours of admission, he expressed increasing paranoia and auditory and visual hallucinations, which, after attempting to escape, resulted in an involuntary psychiatric hold for grave disability,"" the case report said.Once stabilized, the man revealed that he had conducted a ""personal experiment"" to eliminate table salt from his diet after reading about its potential health risks.

Free speech clash: Supreme Court allows Mississippi's law requiring age verification for minors; tech giants oppose mandate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/free-speech-clash-supreme-court-allows-mississippis-law-requiring-age-verification-for-minors-tech-giants-oppose-mandate/articleshow/123312681.cms,"US Supreme Court (AP image)





The US Supreme Court on Thursday declined to temporarily block a Mississippi law that requires age verification and parental consent for minors to use social media platforms.The law, aimed at protecting young people from potential online harm, will remain in effect while legal challenges continue. It is one of several measures passed by US states to curb the influence of social media on children.NetChoice – a group representing companies including Facebook, Instagram , Reddit, X and YouTube had asked the Supreme Court to halt the law after the New Orleans-based 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals allowed its enforcement. A lower court had earlier blocked the law, ruling it likely violated the First Amendment.US District Judge Sul Ozerden said the measure was overly broad and that parents already have other ways to monitor their children’s online activity.The Supreme Court did not explain its decision. However, Justice Brett Kavanaugh noted that while the law may be unconstitutional, NetChoice had not proven that enforcing it during the court battle would cause enough harm to justify halting it, USA Today reported.NetChoice attorney Paul Taske called the ruling a “procedural delay” and expressed confidence the group would ultimately prevail in protecting free speech rights.“Although we’re disappointed with the Court’s decision, Justice Kavanaugh’s concurrence makes clear that NetChoice will ultimately succeed in defending the First Amendment − not just in this case but across all NetChoice’s ID-for-Speech lawsuits,"" Taske said in a statement.Mississippi officials defended the law, saying it targets platforms that allow predators to contact minors. They cited a case in which a 16-year-old boy took his own life after he met someone on Instagram who threatened to expose their sexual encounter unless he paid $1,000.The state also argued that blocking the law conflicted with the Supreme Court’s earlier decision to uphold a Texas law requiring age verification for pornographic websites.NetChoice maintains the law infringes on free speech by forcing all user, including adults to provide personal information to access online platforms.""Social media is the modern printing press − it allows all Americans to share their thoughts and perspectives,” Taske said. “Just as the government can’t force you to provide identification to read a newspaper, the same holds true when that news is available online.”","Mississippi law requires age verification and parental consent for minors to use social media platforms.

US President Donald Trump again claimed he brokered peace between India and Pakistan when the countries were probably going ""nuclear"". The statement came as Trump is all set to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday in Alaska to settle the Russia-Ukraine war. As Trump spoke about the negotiations he facilitated since coming to power, he mentioned India and Pakistan, though India repeatedly rejected Trump's ceasefire claims.""I've solved six wars in the last six months, little more than six months now. And I'm very proud of it. We had one war raging, as you know, for 37 years. One in the Congo with Rwanda was raging for 31 years. We solved six of them. Made peace, not just solved them. If you look at Pakistan and India. Planes were being knocked out of the air. Six or seven planes came down. They were ready to go. Maybe nuclear.

Pakistan rejected the claim.On his Alaska meeting, Trump said the more important meeting will be the second meeting he will have with Putin after he sets the stage at the first meeting.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and some of the European leaders may take part in the second meeting, apart from him and Putin.""I think President Putin will make peace, President Zelenskyy will make peace. We will see if they can get along. And if they can, it will be great.Trump said he thought solving the Russia-Ukraine war would be the easiest one, but it's actually the most difficult one.

Trump 'cold-called' Norwegian minister to ask about Nobel Peace Prize; they spoke about tariff,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-cold-called-norwegian-minister-to-ask-about-nobel-peace-prize-they-spoke-about-tariff/articleshow/123312155.cms,"Donald Trump spoke to Norwegian minister about tariff and Nobel Prize, reports claimed.





President Donald Trump called Norway's finance minister Jens Stoltenberg last month to discuss trade tariffs, POLITICO reported, citing Norwegian newspaper Dagens Næringsliv and called it a ""cold call"" to ask about his bid to win the Nobel Peace Prize. Several countries, including Israel, Pakistan and Cambodia, have already nominated Trump for brokering peace as Trump claimed he facilitated peace between many countries since his inauguration in January. Trump also hosted Armenia and Azerbaijan as the two countries ended their hostilities.Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) in March said he would nominate Trump for the award, and Rep. Buddy Carter (R-Ga.) nominated him in June, citing his role in brokering a ceasefire agreement between Iran and Israel.Trump's August 15 meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin is another step towards his attempts to broker peace. While critics are questioning why Putin is being welcomed to Alaska, Trump is hopeful to coerce Putin into an agreement to stop the Ukraine war, as he emphasized that he would understand in the first few minutes of the negotiation talk where it's headed.Trump said a second meeting may follow, where the peace deal could be worked out after the stage is set at the Alaska summit.“It is true that President Trump called me a few days before his conversation with Prime Minister Støre. Several of the president’s staff members also participated in the conversation, including Treasury Secretary Bessent and Trade Representative Greer,” Stoltenberg, the former NATO secretary-general, told POLITICO in a comment.“We discussed tariffs, economic cooperation, and it served as preparation for his call with Prime Minister Støre. I will not go into further detail about the content of the conversation,” he added.The MAGA has been aiming for a Nobel for Trump and if he gets, he would become the 5th US president to receive the prize, following Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Jimmy Carter and Trump’s longtime rival Barack Obama.Trump laid his heart bare on how much he wants to win the Nobel Peace Prize but he believed that they won't give it to him. “It’s too bad. I deserve it, but they will never give it to me,"" he said.The award is given annually in December by the Norwegian Nobel Committee to someone who has worked to establish peace between nations.","President Donald Trump called Norway's finance minister Jens Stoltenberg last month to discuss trade tariffs, reports claimed.

A US department of justice employee has been fired on Thursday after allegedly assaulting a US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agent with a Subway sandwich in Washington DC.The suspect, identified as Sean Charles Dunn, 37, worked in the DOJ’s criminal division in the international affairs section, according to Attorney General Pam Bondi, as reported by CNBC News.“I just learned that this defendant worked at the Department of Justice — NO LONGER,” Bondi wrote on X.The incident took place Sunday night in the city’s Northwest section. A video on X was posted by FBI Director Kash Patel shows a man in a pink polo shirt and light shorts holding a wrapped sandwich while speaking to a small group of federal agents.The footage then shows the man hurling the sandwich into the chest of a nearby CBP officer before running away, with several officers giving chase.According to a police statement, Dunn was apprehended after attempting to flee. While in custody, he allegedly admitted to the act, saying: “I did it. I threw a sandwich.”Dunn has been charged with felony federal assault. Prosecutors say the altercation began after he shouted at a group of federal officers, calling them “fascists,” before throwing the sandwich, as reported by New York Post.“Why are you here? I don’t want you in my city!” Dunn shouted, according to police.Dunn was arrested on Wednesday night, Patel said.The incident occurred amid heightened federal law enforcement activity in the capital. President Donald Trump ordered additional federal officers to support local police on August 7 and later asserted federal control over the DC Metropolitan Police Department, deploying the National Guard.","Sean Charles Dunn, 37, worked in the DOJ’s criminal division in the international affairs section.

‘100% I’ll get him out’: Trump vows to free jailed Hong Kong tycoon Jimmy Lai; Beijing warns against foreign interference,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/100-ill-get-him-out-trump-vows-to-free-jailed-hong-kong-tycoon-jimmy-lai-beijing-warns-against-foreign-interference/articleshow/123310588.cms,"Jimmy Lai (Image: X/@hkdc_us)





Days before winning second presidential elections, Donald Trump vowed to secure the release of 77-year-old jailed Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai Lai is the outspoken founder of the now-closed Apple Daily which is a strong pro-democratic newspaper known for its sharp criticism of China’s Communist Party which was later forced to shut down, as reported by CNN.He had spent more than 1600 days in a maximum-security prison, much of it in solitary confinement. Lai is accused of working with foreign forces, a crime under Beijing’s 2020 national security law that can lead to life in prison and a separate sedition charge. He has not pleaded guilty to all charges.On Thursday, a Hong Kong court was set to begin closing arguments, but proceedings were delayed due to severe weather. The hearings, expected to span several days, will pave the way for a verdict that could test Trump’s ability and willingness to deliver on his October 2024 campaign promise to “100%” secure Lai’s release.Trump has indicated he would raise Lai’s case directly with Chinese leader Xi Jinping , potentially linking it to ongoing US–China trade negotiations. Lai’s aides and supporters say the case has been mentioned informally during recent trade talks. White House officials under Trump have reiterated that securing Lai’s release remains a goal.In an October interview, Trump told podcast host Hugh Hewitt that he would “100%” speak to Xi Jinping to secure Lai’s release if he won the election.Later, as president, Trump vowed to bring up Lai’s case during US trade negotiations with China. “100% I’ll get him out. He’ll be easy to get out,” he said“I think talking about Jimmy Lai is a very good idea,” he told Hewitt in a subsequent radio interview in May, just days before officials met in Geneva for the first round of talks. “We’ll put it down, and we’ll put it down as part of the negotiation.”Beijing and Hong Kong authorities have condemned foreign involvement in the case, calling it interference in China’s internal affairs. Chinese officials have rejected suggestions that the legal proceedings are politically motivated.“Any attempt by any country, organization, or individual to interfere with the judicial proceedings in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region by means of political power, thereby resulting in a defendant not being able to have a fair trial that one should receive, is a reprehensible act undermining the rule of law of Hong Kong and should be condemned,” the city’s Security Bureau said in a statement.Lai, a British national and devout Catholic, is a longtime critic of the Chinese Communist Party and a prominent supporter of Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement. His imprisonment has drawn bipartisan support for his release in Washington and public backing from the UK government.“Jimmy Lai is British, not American. Given the high profile of his case, I doubt that China will be willing to make a deal,” said Yun Sun, director of the China program at the Stimson Center think tank in Washington.Supporters warn his advanced age, diabetes and prolonged solitary confinement threaten his health. Sebastien Lai, son of Jimmy Lai has said that he is hopeful that President Trump will be able to free him.“We’re incredibly grateful that the president knows about my father’s case and has said that he will free him,” Sebastien said. “The president has a tremendous track record in freeing prisoners around the world. So hearing this gives our family a lot of hope.”Paul Harris, former chairman of Hong Kong’s Bar Association, said that Lai’s presence in Hong Kong does not prevent his release. He explained that under Hong Kong’s mini-constitution, known as the Basic Law, the chief executive has both the authority and the responsibility, in certain cases, to pardon convicted prisoners or reduce their sentences.“So that power is there, and it’s a matter for the Chief Executive’s decision whether he wants to use it, and one can safely assume that if the President of China wants him to use it, he will use it,” Harris said, referencing Xi.","Jimmy Lai, 77, is accused of working with foreign forces, a crime under Beijing’s 2020 national security law that can lead to life in prison and a separate sedition charge.

Florida Republican Rep and a prominent MAGA spokesperson Anna Paulina Luna said she is certain that Congress has seen evidence of ""interdimensional beings"". What are interdimensional beings? Things that exist and travel between dimensions of space or time. Anna Paulina said she did not make this up and it's based on evidence she's seen. “And that’s not something that I came up with on my own. That’s based on stuff that we’ve seen. That’s based on information that we’ve been told,” she said on the Joe Rogan podcast.Luna, and Kentucky Republican Rep. James Comer, sent letters in February to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, and CIA Director John Ratcliffe, asking for a briefing on all records connected to UAP -- unidentified anomalous phenomena.“Based on testimony that would be based on witnesses that have come forward. But what I can tell you is just we’re told that ... they’ve seen things,” Luna told Rogan.“And what I can tell you without getting into classified conversations is that there have been incidences that I believe were very credible people have reported that there have been movements outside of time and space,” she added. “Based on the photos that I’ve seen, I’m very confident that there are things out there that have not been created by mankind.”Luna leads a task force working on the declassification of federal secrets, organized by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. She told Rogan that during her time working as an airfield manager with the Portland International Guard, she met F-15 pilots who had likely encounters with UAPs.“There’s definitely something that I can tell you with confidence, that we don’t know how to explain currently,” said Luna, adding that she believes information is being withheld.“When you have thousands upon thousands of people throughout time that have reported something, to say that those people are crazy, to say that the whole concept of just asking the question [may mean] that you are not psychologically sound, that in itself is a disinformation campaign to get people to shut up about it,” she said.Luna said she’s never seen a portal or a spaceship but was searching for documentation that could lead to more evidence of life beyond humans.","Rep Ana Paulina Luna said she is certain that Congress has seen evidence of ""interdimensional beings"" Luna, a prominent MAGA spokesperson, said she's never seen a portal or a spaceship but was searching for documentation that could lead to more evidence of life beyond humans.

Putin To Unveil Deadly ‘Invincible’ Nuclear Missile Right Before Trump Alaska Talks | WATCH





New Mexico’s Democratic Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham on Wednesday have declared a state of emergency in Rio Arriba County due to rising violence and drug trafficking.This comes two days after President Donald Trump took control of Washington DC’s police force to combat violent crime in the Democrat-run capital.The county, which includes two Native American Pueblo communities and stretches from Española to the Colorado border, has long suffered from some of the nation’s highest opioid overdose death rates.Governor Grisham said local leaders had urgently requested help, as public safety threats had “overwhelmed local resources.”""When our local leaders called for help to protect their communities, we responded immediately with decisive action,"" Grisham said in a statement. ""We are making every resource available to support our local partners on the ground and restore public safety and stability to these areas that have been hardest hit by this crisis.""The declaration will provide $750,000 to the state department of homeland security and emergency management to coordinate the response and supply resources to affected communities.She said increased criminal activity has resulted in rising cases of homelessness, family instability and fatal drug overdoses.It has put a lot of strain on local governments and law enforcement. Police calls in Española and surrounding areas have doubled in the past two years and police dispatches to businesses have increased four times.The county’s drug crisis, driven largely by fentanyl, has become the worst in the state. Although no immediate troop deployments were announced, the declaration allows authorities to call the National Guard if needed. Emergency funds will help local law enforcement agencies in supporting overtime pay, new equipment and coordinated policing, as reported by Fox News.Local tribal leaders have also raised alarms. Santa Clara Pueblo Governor James Naranjo warned that fentanyl and alcohol abuse were harming children and impacting the wider community.""The Pueblo has expended thousands of dollars trying to address this crisis... and to protect Pueblo children who are directly and negatively affected by a parent's or guardian's addiction,"" said Santa Clara Governor James Naranjo in a July letter to Lujan Grisham. ""But we are not an isolated community and the causes and effects of fentanyl/alcohol abuse, increased crime and increased homelessness extend to the wider community. ""The move follows Grisham’s April decision to send the National Guard to Albuquerque to help address juvenile crime and the fentanyl crisis there.Republican officials welcomed the emergency declaration. Española City Councilor Sam LeDoux called it “a step in the right direction”.""I am pleased that the governor is addressing the out-of-control crime in our community,"" LeDoux said. It has long been overrun and not addressed. Fentanyl has overwhelmed our law enforcement, and this seems to be a step in the right direction to protecting our citizens.""New Mexico GOP Chairwoman Amy Barela have urged the governor to focus on solutions that address the root causes of crime.""This community is long overdue in receiving help to combat the out-of-control crime caused by the failed policies of our state leadership,"" Barela said in a statement.""While I hope the deployment of the National Guard will provide real assistance, the people of Española deserve more than just street counselors — they deserve action that addresses the root of the problem.""""Thanks to President Trump’s America First policies and his decisive action to secure the border, we have already begun to see crime rates decrease nationally. Now, it’s time to put New Mexicans first by ensuring those who commit crimes are caught and held accountable.""","New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham has declared a state of emergency in Rio Arriba County due to rising violence and drug trafficking.

But she took it down immediately. A day later, she filed for divorce.





Ashley Biden, the daughter of former president Joe Biden, ended her marriage of 13 years and filed for divorce from her husband Dr Howard Krein. Signaling a new beginning in her life, Ashley posted Monday a photo on her Instagram stories of her walking through a park, giving a thumbs up, while Beyoncé’s “Freedom” played. She also reposted a quote, “New life, new beginnings means new boundaries. New ways of being that won’t look or sound like they did before,” set to Lauryn Hill’s “Freedom Time.”Ashley and Krein met in 2010 through her older half-brother Beau Biden. They got engaged in October 2011 and then married in June 2012 in Greenville, Delaware.

Pakistan announces Army Rocket Force Command,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-announces-army-rocket-force-command/articleshow/123311070.cms,"



ISLAMABAD: Pakistan turned its Independence Day celebrations on Thursday into a carefully choreographed display of military muscle and political messaging headlined by the announcement of a new Army Rocket Force Command.The event at Islamabad’s Jinnah Stadium, branded Marka-e-Haq (“Battle of Truth”), saw Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif share the stage with army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir, ISI chief Lt Gen Asim Malik, and Asifa Bhutto Zardari. Military representatives from Turkey and Azerbaijan added a touch of foreign endorsement.In his address, Shehbaz also unveiled “Misaq-e-Istehkam-e-Pakistan (Charter for Stability)”, pitched as a call for unity beyond partisan divides.The newly announced rocket force marks a first in Pakistan’s military structure, signalling ambitions for precision-strike capability. But with the economy still under strain, the decision is likely to spark debate over balancing strategic aspirations with fiscal realities.On foreign policy, Shehbaz expressed gratitude to China, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Azerbaijan, UAE, Iran, and, pointedly, US President Donald Trump, for support during tensions with India. He reiterated Pakistan’s firm positions on Kashmir and Palestine, indicating no softening of regional stances.The Independence Day spectacle underscored an image of civil-military unity in a country where political turbulence often overlaps with military dominance. Whether Marka-e-Haq becomes more than pageantry will depend on Islamabad’s ability to deliver on promises of reform, stability, and economic recovery long after the parades are over.","Pakistan turns its Independence Day celebrations into a carefully choreographed display of military muscle and political messaging.

PESHAWAR/ISLAMABAD: Four people were injured when an improvised explosive device derailed six coaches of the Peshawar-bound Jafar Express in the Mastung district of Pakistan's restive Balochistan province on Sunday.There were, however, no casualties, officials said.This is the latest in a series of attacks targeting the Jafar Express.The improvised explosive device (IED) explosion hit the track near Spezand Railway Station, about 25 km from Quetta, shortly after the train with 350 passengers had departed the city at 9 am (local time), a railways official said.""A bomb attached to the railway track exploded loudly, derailing six bogies of the train heading from Quetta to Peshawar. Fortunately, there was no loss of life,"" Muhammad Kashif, public relations officer of the Pakistan Railways' Quetta division, told the media.All injured passengers sustained minor wounds, the official said.Rescue teams, including railway staff, were dispatched to the site, and a relief train was sent to transport stranded passengers to Quetta.Security forces and police cordoned off the area, while a bomb disposal squad was deployed to clear the track.Meanwhile, in a separate statement, Kashif said the services of the Jaffar Express and Bolan Mail were suspended till August 14.The Bolan Mail will resume its operations on August 16 (Saturday), when it will depart from Karachi ""in its proper turn"" and will arrive in Quetta the next day, he added.The Jafar Express, which runs between Quetta and Peshawar, has been repeatedly targeted in recent months.On August 7, the train narrowly escaped a disaster near Balochistan's Sibi railway station, where a bomb planted near the track exploded just after the passenger train had passed.In another incident, on August 4, gunmen fired five bullets at its pilot engine near Kolpur. The separatist Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for the latter attack.In June, a remotely controlled explosive device fitted to rail tracks exploded, causing four bogies of the Jaffar Express to derail in Jacobabad.On March 11, the Jaffar Express was hijacked while traveling from Quetta to Peshawar in the Bolan area, resulting in the deaths of 21 passengers and four security personnel. The security forces in a targeted operation killed 33 terrorists involved in attacking the train.It is believed that ethnic Baloch terrorist groups carry out such attacks.A July 28 derailment of the same train in Sindh province's Sukkur was initially attributed to an explosion but the Ministry of Railways later said it was due to a technical fault.","A bomb attached to the railway track exploded loudly, derailing six bogies of the train heading from Quetta to Peshawar.

Pakistan: Tablighi Jamaat's grip on Khyber Pakhtunkhwa fuels concerns of radicalisation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-tablighi-jamaats-grip-on-khyber-pakhtunkhwa-fuels-concerns-of-radicalisation/articleshow/123203430.cms,"Pakistan: Tablighi Jamaat's grip on Khyber Pakhtunkhwa fuels concerns of radicalisation





KHYBER PAKHTUNKHWA: The rise of the Tablighi Jamaat in Pakistan's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province is sparking fears of cultural erosion and the steady grooming of recruits for radical movements. As reported by Himal Southasian, many Pashtuns say the orthodox Deobandi missionary group is dismantling traditional practices while quietly laying the ideological groundwork for extremism.In Bajaur district, a young resident told Himal Southasian that ""men and women used to dress fashionably, enjoy music, watch television, visit shrines, and play sports without being judged."" Today, he said, the Tablighi Jamaat's puritanical preaching has transformed local life. Activities once central to Pashtun culture are now branded as sinful. ""It has changed the cultural landscape drastically,"" he warned, noting that while the group does not directly preach violence, it produces ""raw human resources that can be easily turned into jihadists. ""Founded in colonial India in 1926, the Tablighi Jamaat is now a global organisation with millions of followers. In Pakistan, its headquarters in Raiwind, Punjab, commands vast influence.According to Himal Southasian, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has become one of the movement's most fertile grounds, with the group leveraging its ""quietist"" image to avoid official scrutiny while embedding Deobandi orthodoxy deep into Pashtun society.The group's impact is most visible in cultural change. Himal Southasian documents how shrines, folk music, mixed-gender dances, and colourful traditional clothing are being replaced by conservative dress codes and rigid segregation. A North Waziristan academic described the Jamaat as ""the root of evil... laying the ideological groundwork for the future Taliban"" and importing an ""Arab culture"" that dismisses Pashtun identity.While the Tablighi Jamaat insists it is apolitical and non-violent, Himal Southasian reports that it shares the sectarian orientation of groups such as the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. Its close alignment with the Pakistan state's Islamisation project dates back to the 1980s, when military ruler Zia ul-Haq and the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) used Deobandi networks - including Tablighi circles - to recruit Pashtun fighters for the Afghan jihad against the Soviet Union. Former ISI chief Javed Nasir was himself a Tablighi Jamaat member.Critics in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa told Himal Southasian that the group's influence has depoliticised Pashtun communities, discouraging discussion of exploitation or military abuses. This ideological shift, they argue, suits the Pakistani establishment, which has long used Islam as a tool for domestic control and foreign policy. A Peshawar lecturer warned that ""Tablighis are making our people orthodox, helping Islamist sectarian groups"" and turning them away from Pashtun nationalism and resistance to militancy.The group's gatherings draw hundreds of thousands annually to Raiwind and regional centres. A businessperson from Khyber district told Himal Southasian that almost every household in the tribal areas now has a member. The Jamaat's appeal as a ""peaceful"" alternative to militant brutality has made it a mass movement - but one that critics say nurtures a mindset receptive to Taliban influence.Perhaps most troubling, Himal Southasian notes, is the way the Tablighi Jamaat erodes ethnic identity in favour of pan-Islamic loyalty. This mirrors the Taliban's removal of Afghanistan's national flag in favour of the white shahada banner. ""Extremism and war have taken away every good thing from us,"" a South Waziristan student lamented.For Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's embattled Pashtuns, the rise of the Tablighi Jamaat represents more than religious revival - it signals Pakistan's ongoing project to reshape a proud, distinct culture into a pliant tool for its Islamist and geopolitical ambitions. As Himal Southasian's reporting makes clear, the consequences are already visible, and they reach far beyond the mosque walls.","Tablighi Jamaat's influence in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province fuels concerns of radicalisation.

‘Unbelievable’: Body found almost intact after 28 years in Pakistan's melting glacier,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/unbelievable-body-found-almost-intact-after-28-years-in-pakistans-melting-glacier-how-did-it-happen/articleshow/123155499.cms,"Image: X@/MarioNawfal





The body of a man missing for 28 years has been discovered in a melting glacier in Pakistan’s remote Kohistan region. A shepherd, identified as Omar Khan, came across the well-preserved remains, clothing still intact, in the Lady Valley, located in the country’s eastern mountains.""What I saw was unbelievable,"" Omar was quoted as saying by the BBC. ""The body was intact. The clothes were not even torn.""An ID card was found with the body bearing the name Naseeruddin, allowing police to identify him as a man who went missing in June 1997 after falling into a glacier crevasse in the area.Once police confirmed the body was that of Naseeruddin, locals came forward with additional information, Khan said.Naseeruddin, who was married with two children, was travelling on horseback with his brother on the day he disappeared. The two had reportedly left home due to a family dispute, as per the police, reports the BBC.His brother, who was with Naseeruddin during the 1997 incident, said they had chosen an unconventional mountain route to avoid possible threats, reports the Express Tribune.He recalled hearing gunfire on their return journey, and in an attempt to escape the attackers, Naseeruddin took refuge in an icy cave, never to be seen again.An extensive search was carried out at that time, but Naseeruddin could not be traced, and a symbolic funeral was held at the location.With the body finally recovered after 28 years, his brother is returning to Lady Valley to determine whether to lay the remains to rest there or bring them back to the family’s ancestral home.Reduced snowfall in the region has left glaciers more exposed to direct sunlight, accelerating the ice-melting process, highlighting how higher temperatures are speeding up glacial melt, reports the BBC.","The body of a man missing for 28 years has been discovered in a melting glacier in Pakistan’s remote Kohistan region.

A United Nations-backed investigator has revealed disturbing evidence of “systemic torture” inside Myanmar’s detention centres, describing electric shocks, strangulations, gang rape and the burning of sexual body parts among the abuses that were documented over the past year.Nicholas Koumjian, head of the international independent team investigating atrocities in the country, spoke as the group released its latest annual report on Tuesday, covering the 12 months to 30 June.The country has been in turmoil since February 2021, ever since the army overthrew Aung San Suu Kyi’s elected government, sparking a civil war. As peaceful protests were crushed with lethal force, those opposing military rule took up arms.Since then, conflict has engulfed large parts of Myanmar.The investigative team, as quoted by AP, said that it had made progress in identifying security personnel involved in detention operations, as well as “perpetrators who have summarily executed captured combatants or civilians accused of being informers.”These perpetrators included members of the security forces, affiliated militias and opposition armed groups.The report details the ""documented torture in Myanmar’s detention facilities which includes beatings, electric shocks, strangulations, gang rape, burning of sexual body parts and other forms of sexual violence,"" according to a summary of the findings.“Our report highlights a continued increase in the frequency and brutality of atrocities committed in Myanmar,” Koumjian said. “We are working towards the day when the perpetrators will have to answer for their actions in a court of law.”“We have uncovered significant evidence, including eyewitness testimony, showing systematic torture in Myanmar detention facilities,” he further added.The team also launched new investigations into atrocities committed in Rakhine state, where the military and the Arakan Army, an opposition force, are battling for control.Rakhine has long been the scene of grave abuses. More than 700,000 people from the Rohingya minority fled to neighbouring Bangladesh in 2017 to escape persecution. About 70,000 more crossed the border last year after the Arakan Army effectively seized control of the territory.The Independent Investigative Mechanism on Myanmar has been operating since 2018 under a mandate from the UN-backed Human Rights Council to document human rights abuses and violations in the country.It has already shared evidence with authorities pursuing cases involving the Rohingya at the International Criminal Court and the UN’s International Court of Justice.","U.N.-backed team releases annual report covering the 12 months to 30 June.

Three Thai soldiers were injured in a landmine explosion on Saturday while patrolling near the Cambodian border, just days after the two countries agreed to extend a fragile ceasefire following their deadliest clashes in decades.The blast took place in Sisaket province at around 10 AM local time (0300 GMT), the Royal Thai Military said in a statement. One soldier sustained a severe leg injury, another suffered wounds to his back and arm, while the third experienced serious ear damage from the blast’s pressure.Tensions have been high since last month’s five-day conflict over disputed ancient temples along the 800-kilometre (500-mile) border, which left at least 43 people dead and forced more than 300,000 residents from their homes. The fighting, which involved jets, artillery, rockets and infantry, ended on 29 July after mediation by US President Donald Trump.On Thursday, Thai and Cambodian defence officials met in Kuala Lumpur and agreed to extend the truce. However, Saturday’s incident has cast doubt over the ceasefire’s stability.Thailand’s foreign ministry accused Cambodia of laying new landmines in violation of the agreement and said it would file an official protest. However the country’s Mine Action and Victim Assistance Authority denied the allegation, insisting no new mines had been planted.Acting PM Phumtham Wechayachai, who was in neighbouring Surin province at the time, has ordered the military to ensure the injured soldiers receive full treatment.","One soldier sustained a severe leg injury, another suffered wounds to his back and arm, while the third experienced serious ear damage.

Sri Lankan authorities on Wednesday arrested former minister Shasheendra Rajapaksa, a nephew of ex-presidents Gotabaya and Mahinda Rajapaksa, over corruption charges related to misusing state land and claiming undue compensation.The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) said Shasheendra coerced officials into granting him compensation for property damage, even though the asset in question was located on state-owned land. He is also accused of misusing government land, fraudulently claiming losses, and committing corruption during the aftermath of the 2022 mass protests which forced Gotabaya to resign.This marks the first arrest of a Rajapaksa family member since the leftist government of President Anura Kumara Dissanayake took office in September 2024, pledging a crackdown on entrenched corruption.Shasheendra, son of former parliamentary speaker Chamal, the eldest Rajapaksa brother, was produced before a Colombo magistrate and remanded till August 19.The once-dominant Rajapaksa family faces mounting legal troubles.

An earthquake of 4.4 magnitude struck Afghanistan on Wednesday, according to the National Center for Seismology (NCS). The quake occurred at 2:24 pm IST, at a depth of 155 kilometers. The epicenter was located at latitude 36.51°N and longitude 70.70°E within the Afghan territory.This was the second quake recorded today, as seismic activity continues to affect the region. Earlier, a magnitude 4.2 earthquake struck at 12:19 pm IST. It occurred at a depth of 47 kilometers, with the epicenter located at latitude 36.54°N and longitude 71.52°E.This is the latest in a series of earthquakes to hit the region in recent days. On August 2, a stronger earthquake measuring 5.5 on the Richter scale struck Afghanistan at a depth of 87 kilometers. Prior to that, on July 29, a 4.8-magnitude earthquake was recorded at a shallow depth of just 10 kilometers.Shallow earthquakes are more dangerous than deep earthquakes. This is so because the seismic waves from shallow earthquakes have a shorter distance to travel to the surface, resulting in stronger ground shaking causing more damage to structures and greater casualties.According to the Red Cross, Afghanistan lies on several fault lines between the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates, particularly in the Hindu Kush mountain region, making it one of the most earthquake-prone areas in the world.The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA), Afghanistan warn that frequent quakes continue to pose a serious threat to communities in the country, which are already vulnerable due to decades of conflict and underdevelopment.The organization also noted that the country is highly vulnerable to natural disasters, including seasonal flooding, landslides and earthquakes.","An earthquake of 4.4 magnitude struck Afghanistan on Wednesday.

Bangladesh Interim Chief Yunus To Stay After Resignation Threat Amid Protests Over Rohingya Corridor

July Declaration unveiled:

Tight security and public celebration:





Bangladesh’s interim chief adviser and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus on Tuesday announced that the country’s next general elections will be held in February 2026, ahead of the holy month of Ramadan. He made the declaration during his address to the nation via state television, BTV and radio to mark the first anniversary of the mass uprising that ousted former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina ""On behalf of the interim government, I will write to the Chief Election Commissioner, requesting that the Election Commission organise a national election in February 2026, before the next Ramadan,"" Yunus said.The announcement marks a shift from his earlier indication that polls would be held in April. The revised timeline comes after consultations with major political parties, including the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) headed by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia which had called for earlier elections.""We will all begin mental preparation and institutional arrangements from tomorrow to complete all arrangements so that this year's election is memorable in the country's history in terms of joy and celebration, peace and order, voter turnout, and cordiality,"" he added.Yunus urged political parties to ensure that youth and women are not excluded from their manifestos or future governance plans. ""Remember, the youth who have changed Bangladesh have the power to change the world as well,"" he said.Earlier today, the interim government had also formally released the ""July Declaration"", a 26-point document outlining proposed reforms in governance, constitutional and political issues.Top leaders from political groups such as the BNP, Jamaat-e-Islami, and the newly formed National Citizen Party (NCP) were present during the official unveiling at the Bangladesh Parliament Complex, commemorating the uprising anniversary.The declaration sharply criticized the 1972 Constitution after its independence war against Pakistan in 1971, calling for reforms aligned with the will of the people.""Whereas, the post-independence Awami League government failed to materialise the people's aspirations because of the weaknesses in the procedures of drafting and in the structure of the constitution, along with its inappropriate application,"" the July Declaration said.It also condemned Sheikh Hasina’s administration, accusing it of turning Bangladesh into a fascist, mafia and failed state through alleged authoritarian rule and human rights violations.""Whereas, during the rule of Sheikh Hasina, under her very leadership, an extreme force that was anti-people, autocratic and against human rights turned Bangladesh into a fascist, mafia and failed state and thereby tarnished Bangladesh's international image,"" it added.The document calls for the 2024 uprising to be given official recognition and proposes that the July Declaration be included in a reformed constitution.Tens of thousands gathered at Manik Mia Avenue in Dhaka to mark the anniversary of Hasina’s ouster. The government declared the day a national holiday. Security was heightened across the capital, with police checkpoints and patrols in sensitive areas.Sheikh Hasina, who had been in power for 15 years, fled to India in August last year following mass protests. Her party, the Awami League, has since been banned by the interim administration, and its registration has been revoked by the Election Commission, effectively barring it from contesting in future polls unless the ban is lifted.Meanwhile, Human Rights Watch (HRW) raised concerns over the interim government's progress on human rights.""The hope of the thousands who braved lethal violence a year ago when they opposed Sheikh Hasina's abusive rule to build a rights-respecting democracy remains unfulfilled,"" said Meenakshi Ganguly, deputy Asia director at HRW.She warned that the interim leadership is struggling to balance security reform with pressures from hardliners and rival political factions.As the nation reflects on the events of the past year, Bangladesh remains on high alert. The month of August also marks the anniversary of the 1975 assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the country’s founding figure and Hasina’s father.","Bangladesh's interim chief adviser and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus announced that the country’s next general elections will be held in February 2026.

A newly formed political party led by students who played a key role in the anti-government protests that led to the ouster of former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina held a rally in the country's capital Dhaka on Sunday, pledging to build a new Bangladesh amid ongoing political uncertainty surrounding the next national election, reported news agency AP.The National Citizen Party, formed by the organisers of last year’s protests, gathered near the Shaheed Minar monument with around 1,000 supporters. Party leader Nahid Islam announced a 24-point agenda and called for the creation of a new constitution to replace the one adopted in 1972.“Exactly one year ago, at this Shaheed Minar (memorial), we vowed to free this country from the hands of dictatorship. By responding to that call, we together defeated the fascist rule and regained control of our country,” Islam said.“Let us all unite and transform this historic 24-point agenda into reality to build a new Bangladesh, a Bangladesh that fulfills the dreams of all citizens, as we move toward the formation of our second republic,” he added, as quoted by the agency.The party did not provide specific details on the proposed constitution but said its goal was to reflect the aspirations of a new generation of Bangladeshis.Separately, the student wing of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) also held a large rally in Dhaka.BNP acting chairman Tarique Rahman, who has been in exile in London since 2008, addressed the crowd virtually and urged supporters to mobilise young voters ahead of the upcoming polls, according to AP.Rahman said, “We must reclaim our democratic rights and engage the youth in shaping Bangladesh’s future.”The rallies took place two days before the interim government, led by Nobel peace prize laureate Muhammad Yunus is set to mark the first anniversary of Sheikh Hasina’s departure from power.Hasina fled to India on August 5, 2024, following weeks of mass protests and political unrest that resulted in hundreds of deaths and thousands of injuries. Yunus assumed office on August 8.The demonstrations come amid criticism of the interim government’s handling of law and order, with opposition parties accusing it of failing to contain mob violence and uphold human rights.With Hasina’s Awami League banned and the political future still unclear, the rallies highlighted the growing activity among both new and established political forces ahead of the next election.","National Citizen Party, formed by the organisers of last year’s protests, gathered near the Shaheed Minar monument with around 1,000 supporters.

"China push: In Nepal, EVs now account for 76% of all vehicles sold",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/china-push-in-nepal-evs-now-account-for-76-of-all-vehicles-sold/articleshow/122960428.cms,"



KATHMANDU: The narrow streets of Kathmandu - sized for pedestrians and rickshaws - are choked with engines. Buses, motorbikes, small trucks and taxis fill the sprawling valley with horns and exhaust. For its more than 3 million residents, just getting around is a dangerous, eye-stinging ordeal.But recently, a new kind of motor has started to ease the crush. Sleek electric vehicles glide by with a quiet hum. Gleaming showrooms do a brisk business in the latest models, and charging stations on highways have turned into rest stops with cafes for drivers. Over the past year, EVs accounted for 76% of all passenger vehicles and half of the light commercial vehicles sold in Nepal. Five years ago, that number was essentially zero. The EV market share in Nepal is now behind only those of a few countries, including Norway, Singapore and Ethiopia. The average for all countries was 20% in 2024.The swift turnover is the result of govt policies aimed at leveraging Nepal's wealth of hydropower, easing dependence on imported fossil fuels and clearing the smog. It has been fed by an intense push from Nepal's biggest neighbour, China, world's dominant manufacturer of battery-powered vehicles.""For us, using EVs is a comparative advantage,"" said Mahesh Bhattarai, DG of Nepal's department of customs. ""In the global market, Chinese EVs are expanding. The same is happening in Nepal."" The effort stands in contrast to policies in the US and Europe, which have blocked Chinese EVs to protect their domestic auto industries. And it carries hope for other developing countries that seek to become wealthier without enduring the crucible of pollution from which many rich nations have already emerged.""We're interested in making sure this rapid growth in these emerging markets doesn't follow the same trajectory as developed markets,"" said the head of sustainable transportation for UN Environment Programme. But as Nepal has learned, there are obstacles. The country has spent heavily on subsidies, and getting rid of the support too quickly could derail the shift to battery power. Even if gas-powered passenger cars are phased out, cleaning the air will require public transportation to go electric as well.Asian Development Bank has been a key financier of Nepal's dams, transmission lines and charging networks. The head of ADB's resident mission in Nepa is cautious about the risk of backsliding. ""Given the economic sense this EV conversion represents, I think I would see it as unlikely that we would have major policy change.""Businesses and advocates are, however, concerned Nepal may already be backing off its commitment to the transition. It has had three PMs in past five years, and priorities have shifted with each of them. Nepal's central bank doubled down-payment requirements for EVs. Govt has been inching up its tariffs on EVs. And auto dealers worry faulty cars from some smaller Chinese brands could discredit the category. Rajan Babu Shrestha holds the licence to distribute cars in Nepal from Tata Motors. He has seen sales skyrocket on his EVs, but he could go back to selling gas-powered vehicles if tariffs rose or subsidies for charging stations went away. ""Stability is always a question mark.""","Electric vehicles account for 76% of all passenger vehicles and half of light commercial vehicles sold in Nepal. The EV market share in Nepal is now behind only those of a few countries, including Norway, Singapore and Ethiopia. The swift turnover is the result of govt policies aimed at leveraging Nepal's wealth of hydropower.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122960480,imgsize-759119,width-400,resizemode-4/122960480.jpg"

LONDON: A multi-million pound conservation programme in England helped save 150 struggling species but ""time is running out"" to halt the decline, the head of Natural England, which led the initiative, said Wednesday.The public body, responsible for protecting and enhancing England's natural environment, invested a £13 million ($17.6 million) grant in efforts to support animal and plant species such as water vole, oystercatcher, lady's slipper orchid, the hazel dormouse and Atlantic salmon.""From the Lizard Peninsula in Cornwall to Cumbria and Northumberland, 63 different projects involving 78 partners have transformed landscapes and supported the recovery of 150 species, many of which were on the brink of national extinction, through research, captive breeding, habitat creation, and conservation translocations,"" the body said in a statement released Wednesday.More than 15,000 individual animals and plants were translocated to expand species territories under the projects, which ran from August 2023 to March 2025.Notable successes include the reintroduction of black grouse to the North Yorkshire Moors, northern England, and the return of the large marsh grasshopper to the Norfolk Broads in east England after an 85-year absence.Despite the achievements, the chair of Natural England Tony Juniper warned more needed to be done.""A rising number of nature recovery projects, both large and small, are making a huge difference up and down the country,"" he said in the press release.""We know we can turn round species decline and improve ecosystems with the right targeted actions, the drive and the funding. But time is running out fast,"" he added.Juniper called for more projects, more volunteers and more investment, particularly from the private sector.","Multi-million pound conservation programme in England helped save 150 struggling species.

UK court of appeal refuses to increase sentence of boy who killed Bhim Kohli,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-court-of-appeal-refuses-to-increase-sentence-of-boy-who-killed-bhim-kohli/articleshow/123288743.cms,"



LONDON: Court of Appeal judges here have refused to increase the seven-year sentence given to a 15-year-old boy for killing much-loved 80-year-old British Indian grandfather Bhim Kohli, saying the sentence he was handed down was correct.On Wednesday, Lady Justice Macur, Justice Cutts and Justice Murray dismissed the application by the solicitor-general for permission to appeal against the boy’s sentence on the basis it was unduly lenient.The judges also dismissed an application for permission to appeal the sentence by the boy’s lawyer, Balraj Bhatia KC, who claimed it was “manifestly excessive”.Lucy Rigby KC had referred the case to the Court of Appeal in July. The boy was acquitted of murder but convicted of manslaughter in April and sentenced in June.Kohli, an active and fit man who was held in high regard by the local community, was killed on Sept 1, 2024 while walking his dog in a Leicestershire park. The boy, then aged 14, put on a balaclava, knocked him to the ground, then hit him round the head with his slider shoe as he was on his knees trying to get up as a girl he was with, then aged 12, laughed and filmed the attack on her mobile.The boy attacked Kohli a second time near the park exit, punching and kicking him, breaking three ribs. He died later in hospital.The sentencing was enhanced due to aggravating factors which included the boy calling Kohli a “Paki”. Kohli was born in Punjab, India.Bhatia argued that calling Kohli a “Paki” was at the lower end of the scale of racism and the addition to the sentence was excessive. The court heard the boy’s sentence was half what an adult would get.Lady Justice Macur said: “We understand that not only his family but the public too were shocked at the lenient sentence of 7 years. However , the sentencing of children and young people for serious offences is complex. Many are not fully developed and may not understand the pain they cause to victims. The court must bear in mind the principle is to prevent offending and the welfare of the child. We do not find the sentence unduly lenient. ”She rejected the argument that adding six months to the sentence for racial aggravating factors was excessive and praised Kohli’s “sunny disposition” and “enjoyment of life” to his family who were in court.","Court of Appeal judges refuse to increase the seven-year sentence given to a 15-year-old boy for killing much-loved British Indian grandfather Bhim Kohli.

"UK asks people to 'delete' old emails to save water, drought situation 'nationally significant'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-asks-people-to-delete-old-emails-to-save-water-drought-situation-nationally-significant/articleshow/123266577.cms,"UK asks people to delete old emails to save water.

List of UK cities in drought



UK government's 7 tips on how to save water at home



Install a rain butt to collect rainwater to use in the garden Fix a leaking toilet -- leaky loos can water 200-400 litres a day. Use water from the kitchen to water your plants. Avoid water in your lawn-- brown grass will grow back healthy. Turn off the taps when brushing teeth or shaving. Take shorter showers. Delete old emails and pictures as data centers require vast amounts of water to cool their systems.





The UK government has asked its people to delete old emails to play their part in not wasting water as the current drought situation has been defined as a ""nationally significant incident"". Old emails, photos stored in data clouds require vast data centers and they consume large amounts of water to keep cool.The advice was issued as Britain endures its fourth heatwave of the summer. Five areas of England are currently officially in drought, with six more in 'prolonged dry weather'.""The current situation is nationally significant, and we are calling on everyone to play their part and help reduce the pressure on our water environment,"" Helen Wakeham, the Environment Agency's director of water, said.""We are grateful to the public for following the restrictions, where in place, to conserve water in these dry conditions.""Simple, everyday choices – such as turning off a tap or deleting old emails – also really helps the collective effort to reduce demand and help preserve the health of our rivers and wildlife.""Drought has been declared in Yorkshire, Cumbria and Lancashire, Greater Manchester, Merseyside and Cheshire, East Midlands, and the West Midlands. Areas categorised as having had ""prolonged dry weather"" (the phase before drought) are: Northeast, Lincolnshire and Northamptonshire, East Anglia, Thames, Wessex, Solent and South Downs.Hosepipe bans are still in place for all Yorkshire Water customers along with some customers of Thames Water, South East Water and Southern Water.","The UK government has asked its people to delete old emails to play their part in not wasting water.

"Mia Tindall cheers on mum Zara at Hartpury, and her love of horses is clear",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/mia-tindall-cheers-on-mum-zara-at-hartpury-and-her-love-of-horses-is-clear/articleshow/123263060.cms,"Credit: AL123/Splash News & Max Mumby/Indigo/Getty Images

Zara Tindall spent the weekend competing at the NAF Five Star International Hartpury Horse Trials in Gloucestershire. Beside the warm-up ring, her 11-year-old daughter Mia watched closely, smiled for photos, and reached up to stroke one of Zara’s horses. The small moments told their own story. Mia looks at home around the stables.Zara rode two familiar partners at Hartpury. She brought Showtime, known in the yard as “Cracker,” and Class Affair, nicknamed “Socks.” Between rounds, Mia stayed close, chatting with her mum and keeping an eye on the action. It was a simple family scene at a busy event.The outing fits a long family pattern. Zara is an Olympian who has spent most of her life around eventing. Her mother, Princess Anne, was the first royal to compete at the Olympics. Her late grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, was a lifelong horsewoman. Seeing Mia comfortable in that world feels natural, and it hints at a next chapter for the Tindalls’ eldest child.Crowd shots from Hartpury showed Mia following each phase and cheering from the ropes. She watched showjumping from close enough to see take-off strides and leaned forward during cross-country updates.Nothing about it felt forced. It looked like a child enjoying her mum’s sport.The event itself is a regular stop for Zara. It draws strong fields across levels and gives riders a good mid-season test. This year she balanced competition with being present for her daughter, and the cameras picked up that easy rhythm. A rider’s focus can be intense on show days. Zara still made space for quick smiles with Mia before heading back to the horsebox.There was also a small stable-side detail that fans loved. Mia reached up to pat Showtime and grinned as the horse flicked an ear toward her. Little gestures like that say more than any speech about where a child’s interests might lead. No one is mapping out her future, but comfort around horses often starts with moments like this.Zara has said before that all three of her children have been on a pony. That early exposure shows. Mia moved around the yard with confidence, giving the horses space when needed and stepping back when grooms asked. It is the kind of quiet horsemanship children pick up by being around good yards.Mother and daughter also offered a simple picture of support. When Zara finished a round, Mia was there. When the next phase approached, Mia made way so the team could work. For families who live the show circuit, that balance is familiar. It is how many young riders begin, watching first, riding later.The photos from Hartpury will add to Mia’s growing gallery of equestrian days out. For now, it is enough to see interest and joy. If she chooses to ride more in public, she will have a mother who understands the sport at the highest level and a family who know how to blend normal life with busy weekends on the road.Hartpury offered a gentle reminder of what this family values. Horses, routine, and time together. One weekend, two good horses, and a child who could not stop watching. That was the story from the rails, and it was easy to read.","Zara Tindall spent the weekend competing at the NAF Five Star International Hartpury Horse Trials in Gloucestershire.

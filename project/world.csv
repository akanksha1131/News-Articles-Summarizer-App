DHAKA: Bangladesh International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) on Wednesday sent 15 serving army officers to jail to face trial on charges of enforced disappearances, murders and custodial tortures during former PM Sheikh Hasina ’s tenure. The officers were taken into custody by the army on Oct 11 after a special tribunal ordered their arrest in cases of atrocities linked to the Taskforce for Interrogation Cell and the Joint Interrogation Cell.The tribunal did not hear any bail petitions, noting there is a formal process for such petitions, and the officers could submit formal applications before the next hearing on Nov 5, chief prosecutor Tajul Islam told reporters. “The Bangladesh army has extended cooperation to the judicial process,” he said. Defence counsel M Sarwar Hossain said the accused would be kept in a sub-jail inside the cantonment.ICT is also likely to set the date for delivering its verdict in ‘crimes against humanity’ cases— committed last year — filed against Hasina, former home minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal and former police IG Chowdhury Abdullah Al-Mamun. Prosecutor Mizanul Islam said the state-appointed counsel for Hasina and Khan, as well as the defence lawyer representing approver Mamun, concluded their arguments on Wednesday.","The officers were taken into custody by the army on Oct 11 after a special tribunal ordered their arrest.

The journalist’s defense contrasts with multiple clips circulating online showing some attendees enteringand limited visible security presence around high-traffic meet-and-greets, fueling discussion about the effectiveness of on-floor protection.The controversy reignited questions about the difference between entrance security and active protection during events. Critics argue that strict badge checks and facial verification matter little if creators remain vulnerable to harassment or assault inside the venue.

How Kramnik and Naroditsky’s relationship evolved — from public glasses







American chess Grandmaster Daniel Naroditsky took his last breath on Sunday, at the age of 29, his family confirmed on Monday.Naroditsky, known as “Danya” in the chess community, was among the world’s top-ranked blitz players and a well-known chess commentator, author, and content creator.Till now there has no news on the reason behind the death, however, former World Chess Champion Vladimir Kramnik has alleged a foul play, hinting at possible drug use and alleging that signs of distress were ignored by those close to Naroditsky.Vladimir Kramnik, who previously accused Naroditsky of cheating in 2024, shared screenshots on social media from a private message sent by a viewer who had watched Naroditsky’s final stream.The message expressed concern over Naroditsky’s condition and questioned whether he was under the influence of drugs.Sharing the screenshot, Kramnik tweeted, ""What exactly happened? Because I received this two days ago from a friend of mine, chess fan, and at least did what I could to warn people to do something urgently in my posts. To those who prefer blaming and shaming instead of helping. Awful tragedy, hope properly investigated.""Before Naroditsky’s death was confirmed, Kramnik had posted several tweets suggesting the streamer was “on something else than sleeping pills.”After the news broke, he continued to criticize those close to Naroditsky, alleging they ignored signs of serious problems.In another tweet, he wrote, ""Too high price paid, but if I was the only person shouting about obvious long-term problems of Danya becoming alarming, requiring urgent measures from people around, while 'friends' only cared about hiding it and erase evidence, it’s rotten to the core.""The controversy that cast a long shadow over Daniel Naroditsky's final year commenced when Vladimir Kramnik publicly accused him of cheating through a series of online posts in early 2024.Kramnik alleged that Naroditsky used a second screen to consult chess engines, a serious accusation undermining the integrity of a professional player. Naroditsky, ranked among the world's top 75 in Rapid and top 25 in Blitz, had to defend himself in the court of public opinion.He strongly denied the allegations, stating that his streaming setup had been misinterpreted by Kramnik. In a raw and emotional response, Naroditsky described the former world champion as 'worse than dirt' for making such damaging claims without concrete evidence.The allegations compelled Naroditsky to release detailed videos defending his setup and playing style, an ordeal that visibly affected the popular streamer, International Business Times UK reported.","Daniel Naroditsky, 29, died on Sunday, his family confirmed on Monday.

New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani continues to hold a double-digit lead in the race, but his advantage over Andrew M.

The race is entering its final phase, with the next debate scheduled for Wednesday, early voting set to commence in five days, and Election Day 15 days away, CBS news reported.CBS News New York reports that the same poll suggests a tight race between Cuomo and Mamdani should Sliwa withdraw, placing Cuomo four percentage points behind Mamdani—within the poll's margin of error. In such a scenario, Mamdani would lead with 44.6% against Cuomo's 40.7%.""I’m not dropping out,"" Sliwa declared, reaffirming his participation in the race.

I believe he’s, ultimately, irrelevant, because he’s not a viable candidate and I don't think people are gonna throw away their vote,"" Cuomo stated.Sliwa responded, ""I’m not dropping out.

I never heard a caveat that said one person, one vote, and of course others need to drop out along the way.""Mamdani welcomed Sliwa's participation, stating, ""It’s genuinely positive for our democracy that there’s another candidate in this race who believes New York City voters should pick their next mayor, not billionaires who mostly live somewhere else.""He also criticised Cuomo for focusing on other candidates, noting, ""We are spending this time speaking directly to New Yorkers.

Who is Najah Al Masaeed?





How the Najah Al Masaeed $7 million scam unfolded?

“Justice for Najah” trends across the arab world

Financial scam trends in the MENA region

Jordanian authorities launch investigation





The Arab world was left stunned this week after Emirati-Jordanian poet and television personality Najah Al Masaeed revealed that she had fallen victim to a massive financial scam, losing what she described as a “very large sum” of money. In a tearful video shared across her social media accounts, Najah said she had been deceived by individuals she trusted deeply, describing the ordeal as a calculated act of fraud rather than a spontaneous theft. The revelation ignited a wave of support and outrage across the Middle East, with fans, journalists, and fellow artists calling for justice and stronger protections against organized scams targeting public figures.Born in Al Mafraq, Jordan, in 1977, Najah Al Masaeed became one of the most influential female voices in Arabic poetry. She gained fame for her emotionally charged verses and eloquent performances, earning admiration from the late King Hussein of Jordan, who offered her a scholarship after she recited a poem in his presence.Najah studied Sociology at Mutah University, becoming one of the few women of her generation to pursue higher education.Her boldness and intellect led her to become a prominent media presenter, poet, and cultural figure, later acquiring Emirati nationality in recognition of her artistic contributions.Over the years, she became a symbol of female empowerment in Arab arts, inspiring countless young women to pursue literature and public life without fear.In her emotional confession, Najah disclosed that she had been the victim of a well-planned fraud that cost her a staggering five million Jordanian dinars (approximately USD 7 million). Though she did not name the perpetrators, Najah made it clear that the scam was perpetrated by someone she personally trusted, likely linked to a business or investment venture “It’s not a small amount. I was deceived in a way that broke my heart and faith in people,” she said in a viral video.According to reports from Youm7 and Al-Mashhad, Najah has filed a formal complaint and initiated legal proceedings to recover her stolen funds. The case is currently being investigated by Jordanian authorities. Sources close to the poet indicated that the scheme involved false investment promises and manipulated documents, convincing Najah to transfer large sums over time.The case quickly became a social media storm, with hashtags like #JusticeForNajah, #NajahAlMasaeedScam, and #ArabCelebrityFraud trending across Jordan and the UAE. Prominent Arab influencers and writers publicly voiced support, urging authorities to hold the perpetrators accountable and applauding Najah for her transparency.According to recent reports from regional financial crime authorities and cybersecurity firms, financial scams targeting high-net-worth individuals and public figures in the MENA region have risen by over 25% in the past three years. In 2024 alone, the Jordanian Anti-Fraud Authority reported losses exceeding JD 120 million (approx. USD 170 million) due to investment, digital banking, and trust-based scams, while UAE authorities cited over AED 500 million in reported fraud cases, a significant portion involving celebrities or public personalities. Most scams involved real estate, online investments, and false consultancy schemes, with an average individual loss of JD 250,000–500,000. Najah Al Masaeed’s estimated loss of JD 5 million (USD 7 million) thus places her among the largest publicly reported cases of celebrity-targeted financial fraud in recent years, highlighting both the sophistication of modern scams and the vulnerability even high-profile figures face.According to early reports, the Jordanian Public Security Directorate has begun examining Najah’s complaint, focusing on banking transactions, digital communications, and contractual documents related to the alleged fraud. Legal analysts say the investigation may expand internationally if the suspects or funds are traced outside Jordan.Under Jordanian law, financial deception and breach of trust can carry severe penalties, including prison sentences and asset confiscation. If the suspects are found guilty, the court could order the restitution of Najah’s funds through asset recovery mechanisms. Najah’s lawyer, whose name has not been disclosed publicly, is reportedly working with financial crime experts to trace the missing money and identify all those involved.The Najah Al Masaeed fraud case combines heartbreak, betrayal, and courage in equal measure. It’s not just a story about losing millions, it's about how trust, money, and fame can collide in today’s interconnected global world. Her emotional honesty has made people listen. Her next steps legally and personally could define not only her legacy, but how Arab media and public figures handle financial fraud and increasing accountability in the digital age.","Emirati-Jordanian poet and TV personality Najah Al Masaeed revealed she had fallen victim to a massive financial scam.

Best time across the US

Peak Date: Night of October 20 into the morning of October 21.

Best Time: After 1:00 a.m. local time until the start of dawn. This is when the radiant point is highest in the sky.

Where to Look: The shower gets its name from its radiant—the point where the meteors appear to originate which is located in the well-known Orion constellation . Look toward the eastern sky after midnight, where the constellation will be rising, eventually climbing highest toward the south-southeast before sunrise.

Why is 2025 the best year to watch?





Tonight, stargazers across the United States have a cosmic treat: the Orionid meteor shower peaks, offering up to 20 shooting stars per hour. From New York to Los Angeles, the best viewing is after midnight until dawn, with clear, dark skies giving skywatchers a front-row seat to Halley’s Comet debris streaking across the night sky. Don’t miss this annual celestial spectacle—perfect for a late-night blanket and a hot cocoa under the stars.If you love a little magic in the night sky, tonight is your chance! The Orionid meteor shower, born from debris left by Halley’s Comet, is lighting up the sky. Peak viewing starts late October 20 into the early hours of October 21, 2025, giving skywatchers across the Northern and Southern Hemispheres a stellar show.This year, you can expect up to 20 meteors per hour streaking across the sky, creating a dazzling display of “falling stars.” The best part? No telescope needed, your eyes are enough to enjoy the spectacle.The best time to see the Orionids in 2025 will be during their peak activity, which occurs on the night of Monday, October 20, into the early morning of Tuesday, October 21. For U.S. viewers, the key viewing window is between midnight and dawn.During the peak, observers under a clear, dark sky can expect to see an average of 10 to 20 meteors per hour.Pro-Tip: You do not need to look directly at the Orion constellation. Meteors will appear across the entire sky. In fact, looking 45 to 90 degrees away from Orion will give you longer, more impressive meteor streaks due to an effect called foreshortening.Even if you can’t reach these far-off locations, any dark spot away from city lights will dramatically improve your meteor viewing experience. Remember to bring a blanket, snacks, and binoculars if you have them.This year’s Orionid meteor shower comes at a perfect astronomical timing: it coincides with a new moon. That’s great news for stargazers because a new moon means the sky is naturally darker, with no moonlight washing out the faint meteors. Without the interference of a bright moon, even the smallest, faintest meteors become visible to the naked eye. This makes it easier to spot streaks shooting across the sky at up to 66,000 mph, producing the iconic “falling star” effect that makes meteor showers so magical.Another advantage this year is the late October timing. During this period, much of the United States experiences cooler, crisp autumn nights, which often coincide with clearer skies. Unlike summer evenings that may be hazy or humid, fall nights offer better air transparency, helping meteors appear brighter and more vivid. For US viewers, this combination of a new moon, cool autumn skies, and the Orionids’ peak activity makes 2025 a particularly prime year to witness the meteor shower.Even casual stargazers or families watching from their backyard can enjoy a spectacular display of up to 20 meteors per hour, creating a true “sky full of falling stars” experience that’s hard to forget. The Orionids aren’t just any meteor shower, they’re remnants of Halley’s Comet, streaking through our skies after millions of years. Tonight is a chance to witness 20 meteors per hour, make wishes, and share the moment with friends and family. So grab your blanket, maybe a thermos of cocoa, and head outside - your personal cosmic show awaits.","The Orionid meteor shower peaks tonight across the US, offering up to 20 meteors per hour for stargazers.

What to expect from Japan’s new PM?



PM Modi congratulates Japan's elected Prime Minister



PM Modi post





Sanae Takaichi made history on Tuesday, winning Japan’s parliamentary vote to become the nation’s first female prime minister. Her victory was met with enthusiasm in domestic stock markets.Takaichi secured 237 votes in the first round in the 465-seat Lower House, eliminating the need for a runoff, according to public broadcaster NHK.Her election follows a weekend agreement between the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and the Japan Innovation Party to form a coalition government.Takaichi will succeed Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, ending a three-month political deadlock following the Liberal Democratic Party's poor showing in the July elections. Ishiba, who served only one year, resigned along with his Cabinet earlier Tuesday, clearing the way for his successor.“Political stability is essential right now,” Takaichi said at Monday’s signing ceremony with JIP leader and Osaka Governor Hirofumi Yoshimura. “Without stability, we cannot push measures for a strong economy or diplomacy.”A candidate who secures a simple majority in both the lower and upper houses of parliament is elected prime minister.If no candidate achieves this, a run-off is held between the two with the most votes from the first round. In the run-off, the candidate with the most votes wins, even without a majority, as cited by Reuters.If the two chambers disagree, the lower house’s decision takes precedence.After being elected prime minister, Takaichi is expected to form a Cabinet including several allies of LDP kingmaker Taro Aso and other supporters from the party leadership vote.Takaichi is among Japanese politicians who have opposed measures for women’s advancement.

Zero personal income tax: Poland introduces new law for parents with two children – What it means for families,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/zero-personal-income-tax-poland-introduces-new-law-for-parents-with-two-children-what-it-means-for-families/articleshow/124671648.cms,"(AI-generated image)

Public reception







Poland’s president, Karol Nawrocki, has approved a new law that removes personal income tax for parents raising at least two children.The move is aimed at supporting families, boosting household income, and stimulating the economy.The bill was presented in August. It removes the income tax obligation for families earning up to 140,000 zloty (€32,973) per year. It applies to all parents with legal responsibility for children, including legal guardians and foster parents.According to calculations by the presidency, an average Polish family is expected to be around 1,000 zloty (€235) better off each month due to the new tax relief. However, the full impact of the law will only be visible in the 2026 tax return, which will be filed in 2027.The reform is part of a broader effort to reduce the tax burden on families, increase disposable income, encourage professional activity, and stimulate consumption. Nawrocki made zero personal income tax (PIT) a central promise during his presidential campaign. He first announced the measure in March as part of his ""Contract with the Poles,"" pledging to implement it from the first day of his presidency. After winning the June run-off, he signed the bill in August 8 before sending it to the Sejm, Poland’s parliament.Zero PIT is also part of a package known as the ""tax armour,"" which includes a reduction in VAT from 23 per cent to 22 per cent, the abolition of capital gains tax, and the introduction of a quota-based pension indexation.Experts note that the benefits of the new tax law are likely to be greater for wealthier families. Piotr Juszczyk, chief tax adviser at inFakt, said, “Low-income families, who pay little or no income tax, will gain a negligible amount while those with high incomes will benefit the most.”Families earning 7,000 zloty (€1,648) a month can expect a relief of around 395 zloty (€93) per month, while those earning 12,000 zloty (€2,826) per month could save 913 zloty (€215) monthly, or over 11,000 zloty (€2,590) annually. Families earning the lowest national income will see only minimal savings, and those already below the tax-free threshold will see no change.Public outlook was largely positive. During consultations on 11 September, 476 people participated, with 76% supporting the new law and 66% approving the economic and financial assessment presented by the president. Only a small minority, around 16%, expressed strong opposition.","Poland's president Karol Nawrocki has approved a new law that removes personal income tax for parents raising at least two children.

The US military carried out its ninth strike against an alleged drug-smuggling vessel on Wednesday, destroying the boat and killing three people in the eastern Pacific Ocean, US defence secretary Pete Hegseth announced.Sharing a video of the strike on social media, Hegseth said the vessel, part of a known narco-trafficking route, was carrying drugs.Three suspected narco-terrorists were killed in international waters, with no US casualties.

We’re allowed to do that,” adding that similar strikes could eventually target land operations.“We will hit them very hard when they come in by land,” Trump told reporters, as cited by AP. “We’re totally prepared to do that.

Florida councilman Chandler Langevin who called for a mass deportation of Indians from the US, mocked Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi after the Indian-origin Congressman denounced Langevin's hate speech. Calling Krishnamoorthi a 'foreign occupier', Langevin said Krishnamoorthi's name is unpronounceable and his country of origin is Tatooine, a Star Wars location.Chandler Langevin is a city councilmember in Florida who has been making a series of derogatory comments against Indians and callin for their mass deportation .

This nation was founded on immigrants … We are all part of the very fabric of the flag, our banner, the United States of America,"" Mayor Rob Medina, who also serves on the council, said.Hindus for Human Rights, a national advocacy organization, released a letter calling the remarks “overtly bigoted, dehumanizing, and dangerous” and urged the Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, to suspend Langevin from his role.Langevin, however, refused to apologize for his statements and doubled down on what he said.He said he is not the first Republican to make a mean tweet and he meant to start a discourse on immigration. He also said that his target was not the Indian-Americans settled in the country and contibuting to the country but the migrants.Democratic leader and US representative for Illinois's 8th congressional district Raja Krishnamoorthi issued a statement condemning the recent remarks by Langevin. “It’s unacceptable—and dangerous—that in 2025 we’re hearing elected officials call for the mass removal of Indian Americans.

Trump’s Diwali Goof at White House: Fumbles ‘Diwali’, Mocks Indian Names | WATCH





MAGA fundamentalists are having an almighty meltdown after US President Donald Trump hosted a Diwali celebration in the White House on Tuesday, their hysteria underlining the growing hostility towards immigrants and foreigners in nativist circles in America.Scores of MAGA supporters, many of them Christian nationalists, berated the Trump on social media after he lit a Diwali diya (lamp) in the Oval office in the presence of prominent Indian-Americans in his administration and from Corporate America.“The White House has been defiled by celebrating Diwali with a pagan ritual” and “Trump has been compromised by demon worship” were among the dozens of posts on X from MAGA fundamentalists, some of whom called for a nation in which Christianity is the only religion recognized by the government.It is not the first time Trump has hosted a Diwali event at the White House; he did so during his first term, continuing an administration tradition that first began in the Bush White House in 2003 and continued into the Obama and Biden administrations, when it got bigger and attracted ever-larger throngs of Indian-Americans.Although Tuesday’s event was much smaller, involving only about two dozen invitees, Trump praise for the community and its success rankled his MAGA base, which has some of the lowest education and health metrics in the country and is in the throes of an isolationist fervor.According to several surveys, median household income of Indian-Americans is double that of white US-born Americans and the national median ($126,000 v $ 69,000). Nearly 80 percent of Indians and Indian-Americans have college degrees compared to 36 percent for native-born Americans,“What a wonderful culture and what a wonderful group of people,” Trump said as he walked into the Oval Office for the lamp lighting ceremony, waving to the CEOs of IBM (Arvind Krishna), Micron Technology (Sanjay Mehrotra), Adobe Systems (Shantanu Narayen), and Palo Alto Networks (Nikesh Arora), who were among the Indian-American executives who attended the event.FBI Director Kash Patel, National Intelligence czar Tulsi Gabbard, Justice Department’s Civil Rights head Harmeet Dhillon, and White House policy Advisor on AI Sriram Krishnan were among those present from the administration.“This is a serious group of people…seriously the biggest business people in the world….whatever they are teaching you, they are teaching you well,” Trump said, talking up the performance of the Indian-American CEOs, including the current stock market performance of their companies and quizzing them about their US investment plans.In the spirit of the current White House, all of them fawned over the President, praising him for his leadership and vision and pledging support for his MAGA outlook.But that did not avert a flood of rage-posting from the nativist flock which sees Indians and Indian-Americans as ""job stealers"" or ""unassimilable foreigners,"" often invoking stereotypes about skin color, hygiene, caste, and religion. “The horrible optics of this are only surpassed by the horrible smell in there,” read one post.Among the critics was Nick Fuentes, a raging racist platformed on Elon Musk’s X, who has become increasingly hostile to Trump and his global engagement.“This administration is a joke,” Fuentes told his nearly million followers, posting a video of Trump lighting the Diwali diya, accompanied by a rant about Trump ""dancing around with a bunch of Indians lighting lamps and eating curry.”"," MAGA supporters, many of them Christian nationalists, berated the Trump on social media. “The White House has been defiled by celebrating Diwali with a pagan ritual” and “Trump has been compromised by demon worship”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124744265,imgsize-1091249,width-400,resizemode-4/lkj-94.jpg"

What happens next





When a California mother discovered that her 11-year-old daughter had been socially transitioned to a boy by school staff without her knowledge, she turned to the courts for answers. Two years later, a federal appeals court has revived her lawsuit, ruling that the lower court wrongly dismissed her claims. The decision marks a significant moment in the ongoing national debate over parental rights, student privacy, and school gender policies — an issue now drawing attention well beyond California’s borders.The case, Regino v. Staley, was filed by Aurora Regino in January 2023 against the Chico Unified School District (CUSD) and Superintendent Kelly Staley. Regino alleges that school officials at Sierra View Elementary allowed her daughter, identified as A.S. in court documents, to adopt a male name and pronouns at school without informing her family.According to filings, this occurred under a district policy that required parental notification only with the student’s consent, effectively preventing parents from being told about a child’s declared gender identity if the child objected.Regino argues that this policy violated her constitutional right to direct the upbringing and welfare of her child under the Fourteenth Amendment.After Regino’s lawsuit was dismissed by U.S. District Judge John Mendez in July 2023, she appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. In April 2025, the appellate panel reversed the dismissal, stating that the lower court had “applied an incorrect legal standard” by requiring pre-existing precedent to recognise the parental right in question.The Ninth Circuit wrote that while no identical precedent existed, the right of parents to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children was “long recognised under constitutional due process.” The case was sent back to the lower court for further proceedings.In its opinion, the panel stopped short of ruling on the constitutionality of the school district’s policy, instead clarifying that Regino’s claims were substantial enough to merit a full hearing.The decision has been hailed by Regino’s legal team at the Liberty Justice Center, a nonprofit public-interest law firm, as a victory for parental rights.“This ruling restores a critical safeguard for families,” said Emily Rae, an attorney representing Regino. “Parents, not bureaucrats, have the right to make major decisions about their children’s identities and wellbeing.”The Chico Unified School District, in a statement to the media, said it would continue to “follow state and federal guidelines on student confidentiality” while defending its policy in court. “Our staff are committed to creating a safe environment for all students,” the statement added, emphasising that the district’s actions were consistent with California’s educational code and anti-discrimination laws.Legal analysts describe the Ninth Circuit’s decision as one of the first appellate-level rulings allowing a parental-rights challenge to proceed in the context of school gender policies. While the ruling does not determine liability, it opens the door for courts to weigh how far public schools can go in supporting students’ gender transitions without parental consent.The decision could also influence similar lawsuits filed in Massachusetts, Maryland, and Wisconsin, where parents have made comparable claims. It adds to a growing divide between states adopting student privacy protections for gender identity and those advancing parental notification laws.“Courts are now being asked to navigate an emerging conflict between two constitutional values: the right to privacy and the right of parents to direct their children’s upbringing,” said Professor Neal Devins, a constitutional law scholar at William & Mary Law School. “This case underscores the need for clearer legal guidance as these policies proliferate across districts.”According to Regino’s complaint, her daughter confided to a school counsellor in 2022 that she “felt like a boy.” Without consulting Regino, the counsellor began referring to the child by a male name and pronouns in class and correspondence. Regino said she only learned about it months later, when her daughter mentioned the new identity at home.“I was shocked,” Regino told reporters in 2023. “No one at the school ever called me, met with me, or even told me this was happening. As a mother, I had the right to know.”The case quickly gained national attention, with critics arguing that such policies undermine parents, while supporters claim they protect vulnerable children from potential harm or rejection at home.California law currently gives schools discretion on whether to inform parents about a student’s gender identity, with several districts adopting confidentiality rules to protect student privacy. The California Department of Education maintains that these policies comply with state anti-discrimination standards.Conservative legal groups, however, have framed the issue as a question of parental authority and transparency, warning that secrecy undermines family trust. Civil liberties advocates counter that forced disclosure could endanger transgender and questioning youth, particularly in unsupportive households.The Ninth Circuit’s ruling does not take a side in that policy debate but reaffirms that such questions belong before a court, not dismissed on procedural grounds.The case now returns to Judge Mendez’s courtroom in the Eastern District of California for a renewed hearing on the merits. Both sides are expected to file updated briefs later in 2025.If Regino ultimately prevails, the decision could reshape how schools nationwide handle gender identity disclosures to parents. Conversely, if the district’s policy is upheld, it could reinforce the principle of student autonomy in gender matters under school care.For now, the Ninth Circuit’s message is clear: the question of who decides what children are told, and when parents should be informed, is not settled — and deserves a full hearing in court.","Aurora Regino filed a lawsuit in January 2023 against the Chico Unified School District (CUSD) and Superintendent Kelly Staley.

39-year-old Mehul Goswami, an Indian-origin New York man, was arrested earlier this month for working two jobs -- one being at the New York State Office of Information Technology Services. This was his remote job while he was working another job in the town of Malta where he was working for a contractor at GlobalFoundries. Goswami was arrested on suspicion of grand larceny resulting in the theft of more than $50,000 in state funds.According to reports, an anonymous email triggered the joint investigation by the Saratoga County Sheriff's Office and the New York State Inspector General's Office. “Public employees are entrusted with the responsibility to serve with integrity, and MrGoswami’s alleged conduct represents a serious breach of that trust,” Inspector General Lucy Lang said.“Working a second, full-time job while claiming to be working for the State is an abuse of public resources, including taxpayer dollars.”Goswami was arraigned in Malta Town Court and released on his own recognizance. Under New York State law, the charge is not considered a qualifying offense for bail.The Times Union reported that Goswami did not want to make any comment on his arrest and the accusation. According to court documents, Goswami worked for the outside employer between March 2022 and September 2025.Goswami is listed as a project coordinator for New York state who was paid $117,891 in 2024, according to SeethroughNY, a website that tracks the salaries of government workers in New York, the Times Union report said.","39-year-old Mehul Goswami, an Indian-origin New York man, was arrested earlier this month for working two jobs.

'Remaining thoughtful': What Walmart said about pausing job offers to H-1B candidates,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/remaining-thoughtful-what-walmart-said-about-pausing-job-offers-to-h-1b-candidates/articleshow/124741773.cms,"Walmart has paused job offers to those who would need H-1B visa to join.

Big Relief For Indians: Donald Trump Clarifies $100K H-1B Fee Won’t Apply To Existing Visa Holders

$100,000 H-1B visa fee not meant for extension, change of status







As Walmart paused offers to candidates who would require H-1B visas, the retail chain said they are committed to hiring and investing in the best talent. But they are being thoughtful about the H-1B hiring approach. “Walmart is committed to hiring and investing in the best talent to serve our customers, while remaining thoughtful about our H-1B hiring approach,” a Walmart spokeswoman told Bloomberg.This comes as the Donald Trump administration imposed a $100,000 visa fee for hiring from foreign countries. According to data, Walmart employs an estimated 2,390 H-1B visa holders, which represents a small fraction of its total US workforce of about 1.6 million.“Walmart is committed to hiring and investing in the best talent to serve our customers, while remaining thoughtful about our H-1B hiring approach,” the spokesperson added.After the administration's new H-1B mandate, Tata Consultancy Services announced that it will stop hiring new employees under the H-1B visa in the immediate future.In the aftermath of the new H-1B mandate, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang struck a different approach and said his company would continue sponsoring H-1B visas as immigration remains essential for America's leadership in technology and innovation.As the visa fee led to chaos among H-1B holders and companies employing them, the USCIS released a fresh memo clarifying that the new fee is not meant for those who are seeking a ""change of status"" or ""extension of stay"". ""The Proclamation does not apply to any previously issued and currently valid H-1B visas, or any petitions submitted prior to 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on September 21, 2025,"" the USCIS said.It added that the proclamation also does not prevent any current H1-B holder from travelling in and out of the US. Many H-1B holders outside the US were immediately called back to the country in panic as they thought they would be diasllowed from entering the country.The proclamation also does not apply to a petition filed at or after ""12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on September 21, 2025, that is requesting an amendment, change of status, or extension of stay for an alien inside the United States where the alien is granted such amendment, change, or extension,"" the USCIS clarified.","Walmart has paused job offers to those who would need H-1B visa to join.

SpaceX, Artemis, and the race back to the Moon

What lies ahead for America’s space agenda





There has been a fair share of name-calling and pettiness in the upper echelons of America’s space leadership this week, with Elon Musk taking aim at acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy on X. The spat erupted after Duffy suggested SpaceX was falling behind on the Artemis lunar programme and would open contracts to rivals, including Blue Origin. The row also recalls earlier tensions when President Trump withdrew Musk ally Jared Isaacman’s nomination to lead NASA, following the well-publicised fallout between Musk and Trump.Elon Musk’s simmering tensions with the Trump administration reignited this week after the billionaire launched a furious online tirade at US Transportation Secretary and acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy. The exchange erupted on Tuesday when Musk accused Duffy of “trying to kill NASA,” moments after the cabinet official suggested that SpaceX was falling behind on the US mission to return humans to the Moon.The clash followed Duffy’s comments on CNBC a day earlier, where he said Musk’s rocket company was lagging behind the government’s schedule for the Artemis programme, the ambitious effort to establish the first long-term presence on the Moon. Duffy added that he intended to open the $2.9 billion lunar lander contract to other bidders, including Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin.“We’re not going to wait for one company,” he said. “We’re going to push this forward and win the second space race against the Chinese.Get back to the moon, set up a camp, a base.”Musk, never one to hold back on his platform X, first replied to Duffy’s post with a with a GIF of a famous exchange in which an African anchor asked a guest, “Why are you gay?” before escalating further. “Sean Dummy,” he wrote in another post, accusing Duffy of “trying to kill NASA.”In response to Duffy’s remarks about opening up contracts to competitors, Musk took a swipe at Bezos’s company, posting, “Blue Origin has never delivered a payload to orbit, let alone the Moon.”In a separate message, he added: “The person responsible for America’s space program can’t have a 2 digit IQ.” He also mocked Duffy’s past as a competitive tree climber, posting a poll asking, “Should someone whose biggest claim to fame is climbing trees be running America’s space program?”Duffy avoided responding to Musk’s personal attacks directly but addressed the broader criticism later that day. “Love the passion,” he posted on X. “The race to the moon is ON. Great companies shouldn’t be afraid of a challenge. When our innovators compete with each other, America wins!”The outburst capped months of uneasy relations between Musk and the Trump administration’s space team, highlighting the mix of political and corporate friction in America’s space programmeThe latest confrontation stems partly from an earlier political rift that began when President Donald Trump withdrew the nomination of Jared Isaacman — a close Musk ally and billionaire pilot — to lead NASA. Isaacman, who previously flew SpaceX’s private Inspiration4 mission, had been Musk’s preferred choice for the agency’s top job. But Trump rescinded the nomination in May, reportedly citing Isaacman’s connections to Musk and his political leanings.“Some people had some axes to grind,” Isaacman said at the time, suggesting that the decision was driven by personal grievances within the administration. Musk reposted several messages defending Isaacman on X, calling him “literally the most qualified and best person to be the new head of NASA.”Instead, Trump elevated Sean Duffy, a former Republican congressman, reality TV personality from, and competitive lumberjack — to serve as Transportation Secretary and acting NASA Administrator. Duffy’s appointment cemented the perception among Musk supporters that SpaceX was being sidelined. The feud deepened when reports surfaced that Duffy had previously clashed with Musk over cuts to the Federal Aviation Administration during Musk’s tenure at the now-defunct Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).Adding fuel to the dispute, an earlier report inreport said that acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy was exploring a plan to fold NASA into the Department of Transportation — a proposal Musk denounced as a catastrophic mistake. On X, Musk and several of his followers warned that such a move could “mark the beginning of the end for American dominance in space.”“The person responsible for America’s space program can’t have a 2 digit IQ,” Musk reiterated in another post responding to the report.NASA Press Secretary Bethany Stevens toldthat while Duffy “had floated the idea of NASA benefiting from being part of the cabinet, maybe within the Department of Transportation,” he “never said he wants to keep the job himself.”Still, the suggestion has unsettled scientists and industry observers who see NASA’s independence as central to its credibility and long-term mission planning. Folding it into a department focused on highways, air travel, and logistics, they argue, could weaken the agency’s technical autonomy and reduce its global standing.SpaceX remains one of several key contractors in NASA’s Artemis programme, alongside Blue Origin, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman. The initiative aims to establish a permanent base on the lunar surface as a stepping stone for future missions to Mars.SpaceX won its $2.9 billion contract in 2021 to develop the lunar lander system that would return American astronauts to the Moon for the first time in more than fifty years. However, the timeline for the Artemis III mission has been repeatedly delayed. NASA’s next crewed lunar flyby, originally scheduled for 2025, has been pushed to April 2026, while the first landing of two astronauts on the Moon’s south polar region is now planned for 2027.Duffy told CNBC that under current projections, the Artemis III landing might not happen until 2028. “We’re not going to wait for one company,” he said, emphasising that the US must move swiftly to “win the second space race against the Chinese.”China, meanwhile, has announced plans to land its astronauts on the Moon by 2030, advancing steadily toward that goal. Duffy has publicly warned that Beijing’s progress represents a serious challenge to US leadership in space exploration.Musk, however, insisted that SpaceX remains far ahead of its competitors. Responding to a user who said, “It seems silly to imagine someone getting us there faster than SpaceX,” Musk replied: “They won’t. SpaceX is moving like lightning compared to the rest of the space industry.”Behind the barbed exchanges lies a deeper contest over who will shape the future of US space policy. Duffy’s administration is keen to diversify contracts and accelerate the Artemis timeline, while Musk sees such moves as political interference that undermines innovation.SpaceX and Blue Origin have until 29 October to present proposals on how they plan to speed up lunar missions, according to a NASA official cited by CNBC. Whether Musk’s company can maintain its lead amid growing political friction remains uncertain.","Elon Musk launched a furious online tirade at US Transportation Secretary and acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy.

Democratic New York mayoral hopeful Zohran Mamdani has criticised Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi , accusing him of promoting a vision of India “that only has room for certain kinds of Indians.” Mamdani made these remarks while speaking at a Diwali event in New York.The New York State Assembly member, who is running for mayor of New York City, framed his comments around his belief in ""pluralism and inclusion"".“I've been critical of Mr. Modi because of the vision that I grew up with was of an India that was pluralistic, an India where everyone belonged, no matter their religion,” Mamdani said.“And my critique has been of Modi and the BJP political party for their vision of an India that only has room for certain kinds of Indians. And it's part of a belief that pluralism is something to be celebrated, something to be strived for,” the New York mayor hopeful added.He went on to say that his campaign in New York is based around representing all residents, regardless of their political views.""Eight and a half million people, many of whom may feel differently than me about PM Modi, and that's their right. And I will look to represent them all the same because my responsibility is to them as New Yorkers to ensure that they are safe,"" he said.With just weeks to go before New Yorkers head to the polls on November 4, Mamdani has positioned himself as a candidate focused on inclusion, affordability and safety. His recent campaign trail included visits to four temples across Queens to celebrate Diwali, ending at Maharaja Sweets in Jackson Heights. He shared images of the celebrations on social media.The visits, which included prayers at the Ganesh Temple in Flushing, highlight Mamdani’s efforts to connect with diverse voters in a city where eight and a half million people hold widely differing views. “While my opponents are focused on speaking about each other and which one of them should drop out, my focus will be on New Yorkers themselves and the concerns I’ve heard from them,” he told reporters this week.Mamdani faces a challenging final stretch of the campaign, with former Governor Andrew Cuomo seeking to consolidate moderate and conservative voters by portraying Republican Curtis Sliwa as a spoiler.Sliwa, the founder of the Guardian Angels, has rejected calls to exit the race and continues to attack both Cuomo and Mamdani, highlighting his outsider appeal.","Democratic New York mayoral hopeful Zohran Mamdani has criticised Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Living Separate Lives? Meghan Markle’s Paris Move Hints At Growing ‘Cracks’ With Prince Harry

A simple, stark demand

An unlikely alliance for a common cause

Is the fear justified or just hype?





In an unusual coalition, Prince Harry Meghan Markle , and prominent figures from the worlds of tech, politics, and entertainment have joined forces with conservative commentators Steve Bannon and Glenn Beck . Their common cause? A demand for a ban on the development of ultra-powerful, ""superintelligent"" AI that they fear could threaten humanity's future.The call for action, organized by the non-profit Future of Life Institute, is directly aimed at tech giants like Google, OpenAI , and Meta, who are locked in a high-stakes race to build Artificial Intelligence that can outperform humans in nearly every cognitive task.The group's statement is a concise, 30-word warning: “We call for a prohibition on the development of superintelligence, not lifted before there is broad scientific consensus that it will be done safely and controllably, and strong public buy-in.”The letter acknowledges that AI can bring benefits like new cures and economic prosperity. However, it warns of a dark side, stating that the goal of creating superintelligence raises fears of ""human economic obsolescence and disempowerment, losses of freedom, civil liberties, dignity, and control, to national security risks and even potential human extinction,"" AP cited.The list of signatories is notably diverse, crossing deep political and professional divides in an effort to show widespread concern.Prince Harry, in a personal note, stated, ""the future of AI should serve humanity, not replace it. I believe the true test of progress will be not how fast we move, but how wisely we steer. There is no second chance.” Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, also signed, as per AP reports.They were joined by AI pioneers who helped create the technology now causing alarm. Yoshua Bengio and Geoffrey Hinton, both Turing Award winners, added their names. Hinton, who also recently won a Nobel Prize in physics, has been vocal about the dangers.The inclusion of Steve Bannon and Glenn Beck signals an attempt to appeal to a broad political spectrum, including supporters of former President Donald Trump .Other notable signatories include Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, billionaire Richard Branson, former top US general Mike Mullen, and Barack Obama 's national security adviser Susan Rice. Actors Stephen Fry and Joseph Gordon-Levitt also signed.Gordon-Levitt, whose wife was previously on the board of OpenAI, commented, “Yeah, we want specific AI tools that can help cure diseases, strengthen national security, etc.”He further added “But does AI also need to imitate humans, groom our kids, turn us all into slop junkies and make zillions of dollars serving ads? Most people don't want that.”This letter is likely to fuel ongoing debates within the tech community about how real the threat of superhuman AI is.Max Tegmark, president of the Future of Life Institute, noted that the criticism has gone mainstream. ""In the past, it's mostly been the nerds versus the nerds,” he said. “I feel what we're really seeing here is how the criticism has gone very mainstream.”Complicating the issue is that the very companies developing this technology sometimes exaggerate their products' abilities to attract investors, creating what some fear is an ""AI bubble.""This is not the first warning from Tegmark's group. In March 2023, they called for a temporary pause on developing powerful AI models. That plea was ignored by major companies, including by its most famous signatory, Elon Musk, who was simultaneously starting his own AI firm.When asked if he approached Musk again, Tegmark said he contacted all major AI CEOs but didn't expect them to sign. He expressed sympathy for their position, trapped in a competitive race. ""I think that's why it's so important to stigmatise the race to superintelligence, to the point where the US government just steps in,"" he concluded.","Prince Harry Meghan Markle and prominent figures from the worlds of tech, politics, and entertainment have joined forces with conservative commentators Steve Bannon and Glenn Beck.

China Breaks Silence on Border Clash, Follows India To Tell Pakistan, Afghanistan to End Crisis

What is a remote sensing satellite?

Poll Do you believe space collaborations between countries are beneficial for advancement in technology? Yes No





China successfully launched a Pakistani remote sensing satellite into orbit on Sunday, accompanied by two of its own satellites, underscoring the deepening space collaboration between the two long-time allies.A Lijian-1 Y8 carrier rocket carrying three satellites—the Pakistan Remote Sensing Satellite (PRSS-2) and China’s AIRSAT 03 and 04—was launched from a commercial aerospace innovation pilot zone in northwest China. The launch successfully placed all three satellites into their planned orbits, according to state-run Xinhua news agency.A remote sensing satellite is equipped with specialised sensors and cameras that observe and measure the physical characteristics of the Earth or other areas from space.It collects data on things like forest fires, temperature changes in oceans, cloud patterns, volcanic activity, urban growth, farmland changes, and the topography of the ocean floor. This helps scientists and researchers monitor large-scale environmental and geographic changes over time, according to USGS.This mission marks the third Pakistani satellite China has helped launch this year, following PRSS-1 in July and PRSC-EO1 in January.In recent years, China has played a key role in expanding Pakistan’s space capabilities, including the launch of a multi-mission communication satellite last year.Back in 2018, China also deployed two Pakistani satellites: PRSS-1, Pakistan’s first optical remote sensing satellite, and PakTES-1A, a smaller observation satellite.","China successfully launched a Pakistani remote sensing satellite into orbit on Sunday.

Pakistan And Afghanistan Agree To ‘Immediate Ceasefire’ After Peace Talks In Doha

Pakistan and Afghanistan have agreed to an immediate ceasefire after several days of deadly cross-border clashes, Qatar’s foreign ministry said on Sunday. The announcement came after at least 10 people were killed in Pakistani airstrikes that followed an earlier truce.“During the negotiations, the two sides agreed to an immediate ceasefire and the establishment of mechanisms to ensure lasting peace and stability between the two countries,” Qatar’s ministry of foreign affairs said in a statement.Officials from both sides met in Doha on Saturday to ease tensions. Kabul had earlier accused Islamabad of breaking a 48-hour ceasefire that briefly paused nearly a week of fighting which killed dozens of soldiers and civilians on both sides.Security officials in Pakistan said the latest strikes in Afghan border areas targeted a militant group linked to the Pakistani Taliban. The attack, they said, came in response to an assault on Pakistani paramilitary forces.Pakistan’s delegation in Doha includes defence minister Khawaja Asif and intelligence chief general Asim Malik, while the Afghan side is led by defence minister Mohammad Yaqoob, the Taliban said.Violence erupted on October 11, just days after explosions in Kabul during a rare visit by Taliban foreign minister Amir Muttaqi to India.

Pakistan's field marshal Asim Munir has yet again engaged in anti-India rhetoric issuing veiled nuclear and economic threats while claiming that the ""misconceived"" immunity of India's geographic vastness will be shattered by the reach and lethality of their weapon systems.Speaking at the Pakistan military academy in Abbotabad (where Osama Bin Laden lived and was killed by the US) on Saturday, the rabble-rouser army chief threatened that a response far beyond the expectations of the initiators (India/Afghanistan) can be expected, if a fresh wave of hostilities is triggered.""With diminishing distinction between combat and communication zones, the reach and lethality of our weapon systems will shatter the misconceived immunity of India's geographic vastness,"" he added.He cautioned and advised the India's military leadership that there is no space for war in a nuclearised environment. ""Core issues should be settled with Pakistan as per international norms, on the basis of equality and mutual respect.

What's happening?

Operation Sindoor and the Muridke connection





A state at war with itself





An imploding picture









“You can’t keep snakes in your backyard and expect them only to bite your neighbours.”External affairs minister S Jaishankar issued a stern warning to Pakistan at the United Nations in 2022. Three years later, Pakistan is yet to mend its ways, and the warning rings truer than ever. Then, both leaders accused Pakistan of nurturing terror groups for strategic leverage. Now, the country is confronting the full consequences of that strategy.Pakistan is in turmoil at all fronts, and at the centre of the latest crisis lies Muridke - the same city India struck during Operation Sindoor , a swift 22-minute campaign that targeted terror hubs including Markaz Taiba, the headquarters of Lashkar-e-Taiba.This week, Muridke is again in the spotlight as it turned volatile after Pakistan’s law enforcement cracked down on a protest camp organised by Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP). The government action has triggered violent clashes, arrests, and growing instability across the region.In a move dripping with irony, the provincial chief minister chaired what her office called an ""extraordinary"" meeting, ordering arrests of ""extremist leaders"" and seizure of assets linked to the same group once courted by the establishment.Over 2,700 people have been detained, and Section 144 has been imposed across Punjab, banning gatherings and protests.Mosques associated with the TLP have been sealed, its social media accounts suspended, and its top brass is being added to Pakistan’s Fourth Schedule—a list of individuals suspected of terrorism or sectarianism.Officials have also announced plans to recommend a federal ban on the party, freeze its assets, and prosecute its leaders under anti-terror laws. AI tools are being deployed to track wanted individuals.Authorities say the TLP’s so-called ""Gaza solidarity"" march to Islamabad had turned, as one official put it, ""bloody as always.""The timing and geography of the crackdown are significant. Muridke was among the nine key sites targeted during Operation Sindoor in May following the Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 civilians.During the four-day campaign, the Indian Air Force destroyed at least six Pakistani fighter jets, two high-value surveillance aircraft, a C-130 transport plane, over ten drones, several cruise missiles, and radar installations.One of its central objectives was Markaz Taiba, Lashkar-e-Taiba’s nerve centre in Muridke — just 25 km from the International Border. The facility, built with donations reportedly including Rs 10 lakh from Osama bin Laden, trained the 26/11 Mumbai attackers.For decades, Pakistan’s national security doctrine rested on militant proxies—to gain ""strategic depth"" against India and influence over Afghanistan. That policy has now imploded.Islamabad is fighting multiple insurgencies at once - from the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) in Balochistan, and even rogue Taliban factions across the Durand Line.According to the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), more than 2,400 security personnel have been killed in 2025 so far—the bloodiest year since 2015. The violence is now driven by what analysts call a ""Quad of Terror"": the TTP, Baloch insurgents, Islamic State–Khorasan (IS-K), and Taliban breakaway groups.Since the Taliban’s 2021 takeover of Kabul, Pakistan’s western frontier has unravelled. The TTP, long sheltered in Afghanistan, now launches near-daily attacks. The BLA targets Chinese projects in Gwadar and convoys in Balochistan. Despite repeated military operations, the insurgency only appears to be deepening.Drone strikes, air raids, and mass arrests have failed to stem the violence. Meanwhile, reports of enforced disappearances, civilian casualties, and militarisation have eroded public trust, especially in Balochistan.The TLP ban, border tensions with Afghanistan, and the fallout of Operation Sindoor together expose a grim truth that India has warned of several times: Pakistan’s long experiment with extremism has backfired catastrophically.When Hillary Clinton stood beside then-foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar, in 2011 and delivered the ""snakes in your backyard"" warning, it was a diplomatic metaphor. Today, it's Pakistan's reality.What began as a policy of control has spiralled into a crisis of survival. Pakistan's greatest threat is no longer at its borders: it's the legacy of its own choices.","Pakistan cracked down on a protest camp organised by Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) The government action has triggered violent clashes, arrests, and growing instability across the region.

Fierce Border Clash Between Pakistan, Afghanistan Intensifies With Tanks, Shelling, High Casualties

Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif on Friday said that his country can no longer maintain its past relations with Afghanistan, alleging, without evidence, that the Taliban leadership is ""sitting in India’s lap"" and warning of a ""heavy price"" for cross-border terrorism, signalling a public hardening of Islamabad’s stance toward a regime it once helped install.His comments came after at least six people, including two children, were killed and seven others injured in airstrikes conducted by Pakistan in Afghanistan’s southeastern Paktika province. The strikes reportedly violated a recent ceasefire agreement between the two countries. Media reports said that representatives from both sides are expected to meet in Doha, Qatar, to address the situation.""Pakistan can no longer afford to maintain relations with Kabul as it did in the past,"" Asif said in a social media post.""All Afghans residing on Pakistani soil must return to their homeland; they now have their own government/caliphate in Kabul... Our land and resources belong to 250 million Pakistanis,"" he added.""Self-respecting nations do not thrive on foreign land and resources,"" Asif said.He stated that despite Pakistan’s efforts and sacrifices over the past five years, Kabul has not responded positively. ""Pakistan issued 836 protest notes to the Afghan side and another 13 demarches,"" he said.Asif warned that Pakistan will now respond more strongly to acts of terrorism. ""There will no longer be protest notes or appeals for peace; no delegations will go to Kabul. Wherever the source of terrorism lies, it will have to pay a heavy price,"" he said.He also alleged that Afghanistan has become a ""proxy of India"" and is working with New Delhi and the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) against Islamabad.""The rulers of Kabul, who are now sitting in India’s lap and conspiring against Pakistan, were once under our protection, hiding on our land,"" Asif said, without providing any evidence for his claim.Earlier this week, MEA Spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal, while addressing the weekly press briefing, said that Pakistan is habituated in blaming its neighbours for its internal problems. ""On the developments that are happening on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, we are closely monitoring the situation three things are clear. One, Pakistan hosts terrorist organisations and sponsors terrorist activities. Two, it is an old practice of Pakistan to blame its neighbors for its own internal failures. And three, Pakistan is infuriated with Afghanistan exercising sovereignty over its own territories. India remains fully committed to the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Afghanistan,"" he had said.The Pakistan defense minister reiterated that Pakistan is prepared to defend itself against any aggression from Afghanistan.Earlier this week, Asif said that Pakistan is ready to respond if the Afghan Taliban ""wish for war."" Speaking to Samaa TV, he said, ""Pakistan remains ready for any aggression; no one should harbour doubt.""Islamabad has repeatedly called on the Taliban government to ensure that Afghan territory is not used for cross-border attacks. Kabul has denied these claims, saying that Afghan soil is not being used against any neighbouring country.Tensions between the two nations have grown following repeated attacks by the TTP, allegedly launched from Afghan soil. A recent attack in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Orakzai district killed 11 Pakistani soldiers, including a Lieutenant Colonel and a Major.","Khawaja Asif says Pakistan can no longer maintain its past relations with Afghanistan.

Pakistan army chief Asim Munir on Saturday repeated his anti-India rhetoric amid its ongoing border tensions with neighbouring Afghanistan.

In the weeks leading up to the Pahalgam attack, Munir had stirred controversy by invoking the two-nation theory—the ideological foundation of Pakistan’s creation—urging citizens to inculcate in their children a sense of distinction from Hindus. He had further escalated tensions by describing Kashmir as Pakistan’s “jugular vein,” a phrase long associated with Islamabad’s territorial ambitions.Just days after the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack, which claimed 26 lives, Munir reiterated his stance, declaring, ""The two-nation theory was based on the fundamental belief that Muslims and Hindus are two separate nations, not one.

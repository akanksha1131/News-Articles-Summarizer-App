'A horrible thing'

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Sunday urged US President Donald Trump to visit his war-torn country before making any decisions on ending the conflict with Russia.In a televised interview, Zelenskyy said Trump needed to see firsthand the destruction left behind by Moscow's invasion.“Please, before any kind of decisions, any kind of forms of negotiations, come to see people, civilians, warriors, hospitals, churches, children destroyed or dead,” Zelenskyy said during a CBS '60 Minutes' interview.He said that a visit to Ukraine would help Trump understand the nature of Russian President Vladimir Putin. “You will understand with whom you have a deal,” he added.Zelenskyy made clear that Trump would be free to visit any part of the country that has seen destruction. “If Trump chose to visit Ukraine, we will not prepare anything. It will not be theater,” he said. “You can go exactly where you want, in any city which (has) been under attacks.”Zelenskyy claimed that Putin never wants to ""end the war.""“Putin can’t be trusted. I told that to President Trump many times. So when you ask why the ceasefire isn't working – this is why,” Zelenskyy said. “Putin never wanted an end to the war. Putin never wanted us to be independent. Putin wants to destroy us completely — our sovereignty and our people.”On the question of peace, Zelenskyy said a just resolution would be one that preserves Ukraine’s independence. “To not lose our sovereignty or our independence,” he said, vowing that Ukraine would reclaim its occupied territory. “We, no matter what, will take back what is ours because we never lost it — the Russians took it from us.”The comments come weeks after a tense exchange at the White House in February between Zelenskyy, Trump and US Vice President JD Vance. Vance had accused Ukraine of organising “propaganda tours” for visiting foreign leaders — a charge Zelenskyy dismissed again in the interview.Trump has been pushing for a swift resolution to the more than three-year-old war, with the US reportedly holding direct talks with both Russia and Ukraine. While Kyiv has accepted a US-backed proposal for an unconditional ceasefire, Moscow has rejected it so far.After a Russian strike on Sunday in Ukraine's Sumy that killed at least 34 people, Trump called it “a horrible thing.”Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump said, “I think it was terrible. And I was told they made a mistake. But I think it's a horrible thing. I think the whole war is a horrible thing.”The White House has not blamed Moscow for the strike. However, US secretary of state Marco Rubio offered his condolences “to the victims of today’s horrifying Russian missile attack on Sumy.”The missile strike on Sumy occurred just two days after Trump’s presidential envoy Steve Witkoff visited Moscow to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin, aiming to advance US-led efforts toward a possible truce.",Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged US President Donald Trump to visit his war-torn country before making any decisions on ending the conflict.

VIRAL MOMENT: Trump Invites Granddaughter Kai To Join Late Night Press Gaggle, Mocks Biden

US President Donald Trump recently took a jab at news organisations during a press briefing labelling them ""fake news"" as he introduced his eldest granddaughter, Kai Madison Trump , to reporters aboard Air Force One .Accompanied by Kai along with Donald Trump III, and Spencer Trump—children of Donald Trump Jr. and Vanessa Trump—attended the UFC 314 fight in Miami. After the match, as the entourage headed back to Palm Beach aboard Air Force One, Trump turned to the waiting reporters, gesturing to 17-year-old Kai, he quipped, “This is the fake news,” before inviting reporters to ask her questions directly. ""What's up, Kai? Come on. You know the fake news.. This is the fake news,"" he said.Trump then went on to praise his granddaughter and her achievements calling her a ""a great athlete"". ""Great golfer and great student, actually,"" he added as he introduced Kai.The jab at the media—one of Trump’s frequent targets—drew a few laughs as Kai greeted the reporters with ""Hey, what's up, everyone?""Kai Trump, who will graduate from The Benjamin School in Palm Beach Gardens in 2026, is already making her own headlines. She plays competitive golf with Charlie Woods, son of Tiger Woods, and is committed to play collegiate golf at the University of Miami. She became a more public figure during the Republican National Convention in 2024, when she delivered a speech offering a personal glimpse into life with her famous grandfather, describing him as a “normal grandpa.”Adding to that evening’s spectacle, Trump’s VIP section at the Kaseya Center where the fight was held featured a high-profile gathering of political and tech leaders. Among those seated with Trump were Elon Musk—now serving as head of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)—and his son, X Æ A-12. Also in attendance were health and human services secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his wife, actress Cheryl Hines; FBI director Kash Patel; Texas senator Ted Cruz; secretary of state Marco Rubio; director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard; and Florida Congressman Byron Donalds.Other viral clips from the night showed Trump appearing to snub a handshake from Hines while greeting RFK Jr., fueling online buzz and one of Trump doing his signature dance after a received a loud and roaring welcome at the UFC event.","Donald Trump recently took a jab at news organisations during a press briefing labelling them ""fake news"" as he introduced his eldest granddaughter, Kai Madison Trump.

In a lengthy Truth Social post, Trump claimed the show was guilty of “fraud” in connection with the 2024 presidential election and said CBS should face severe penalties, including losing its broadcasting license .“Almost every week, 60 Minutes, which is being sued for Billions of Dollars for the fraud they committed in the 2024 Presidential Election with their Interview of Failed Presidential Candidate Kamala Harris , mentions the name ‘TRUMP’ in a derogatory and defamatory way, but this Weekend’s ‘BROADCAST’ tops them all,” Trump wrote.The president alleged that two recent 60 Minutes segments misrepresented him—one involving the war in Ukraine and another about Greenland. “They did not one, but TWO, major stories on ‘TRUMP,’ one having to do with Ukraine, which I say is a War that would never have happened if the 2020 Election had not been RIGGED… the other story was having to do with Greenland, casting our Country, as led by me, falsely, inaccurately, and fraudulently,” he said.Trump further claimed that CBS and its parent company Paramount tried “everything possible to illegally elect Kamala,” referring to Vice President Kamala Harris. He added, “They are not a ‘News Show,’ but a dishonest Political Operative simply disguised as ‘News,’ and must be responsible for what they have done, and are doing. They should lose their license!”Calling on regulatory action, Trump wrote, “Hopefully, the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ), as headed by its Highly Respected Chairman, Brendan Carr, will impose the maximum fines and punishment, which is substantial, for their unlawful and illegal behavior.”CBS and 60 Minutes have not yet responded to Trump’s claims. His post comes amid an ongoing legal battle in which Trump says he is suing the network over the Harris interview and its election coverage.","US President Donald Trump lashed out at CBS’s 60 Minutes on Sunday, accusing the long-running news programme of defamation and dishonest reporting.

"NY Helicopter Crash: FAA grounds helicopter company after crash that killed 6, including Siemens executive",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/faa-grounds-helicopter-company-after-crash-that-killed-6-including-siemens-executive/articleshow/120267862.cms,"The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Sunday announced that New York Helicopter Tours , the company whose sightseeing chopper broke apart midair and plunged into the Hudson River last week, killing six people, is ceasing operations immediately. The move comes amid mounting pressure from federal lawmakers and renewed scrutiny of the city’s helicopter tour industry.“The FAA is initiating an immediate review of New York Helicopter Tours’ operating license and safety record,” the agency said in a statement posted on X, hours after US Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer urged regulators to revoke the company’s license.Thursday’s crash killed all on board — pilot Sean Johnson, 36, a US Navy veteran, and five members of a visiting family from Spain: Agustín Escobar, 49, a Siemens executive; his wife, Mercè Camprubí Montal, 39; and their children Agustín, 10; Mercedes, 8; and Víctor, 4. The family had arrived in New York from Barcelona that same day.Schumer, speaking before the FAA announcement, called the crash “a tragic consequence of regulatory loopholes,” and demanded a crackdown on tour operators. “One of the things we can do to honor those lives and try to save others is to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” he said. “We know there is one thing for sure about New York City’s helicopter tour companies: they have a deadly track record.”The helicopter was operating under FAA’s “Part 91” regulations, a category with looser safety and training standards compared to stricter commercial flight rules. “The rules under Part 91 just aren’t strict enough when people’s lives are on the line,” Schumer said, warning that these relaxed requirements allow companies to ""cut corners and put profits over people.""The ill-fated chopper had been on its eighth flight of the day when witnesses saw it trailing smoke before it spiralled out of control and slammed into the river. Video footage captured parts of the rotor flying off midair. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), now leading the investigation, said the crash occurred less than 20 minutes after takeoff from a Manhattan heliport.Authorities believe a mechanical failure may have caused the main rotor to strike the tail, resulting in catastrophic midair disintegration. NTSB officials confirmed that the aircraft’s main rotor and transmission are still missing, and no final determination will be made until those components are recovered.New York Helicopter Tours has a troubled history. FAA records reveal that the aircraft, built in 2004, had a documented transmission issue last year. In 2013, one of its helicopters lost power mid-flight, though the pilot safely landed. The company has previously filed for bankruptcy and faces several lawsuits over unpaid debts.Schumer also called for increased FAA ramp inspections for all tour operators, including FlyNYON — another operator under scrutiny after a 2018 crash in the East River killed five people. A recent jury found FlyNYON liable for that incident.Industry advocates pushed back, with the Eastern Region Helicopter Council stating that New York sightseeing flights “already operate under the most stringent of regulations.” But critics argue that nonessential helicopter flights in densely populated areas like Manhattan remain a persistent safety hazard.After a 2016 city cap limited Manhattan heliport flights to 30,000 annually, many operators moved to nearby New Jersey. Nonetheless, five sightseeing helicopters have crashed into the Hudson or East River over the past two decades, killing 20 people.","FAA announces it is reviewing New York Helicopter Tours' license and safety record.

He also stated that China is ""actively building a diversified market, deepening cooperation with all parties in the supply chain,"" and added, ""Importantly, China's domestic demand market is broad.""These remarks come a day after US President Donald Trump said no country would be exempt from tariffs. ""Nobody is getting 'off the hook'... especially not China, which, by far, treats us the worst!"" he posted on his Truth Social platform.Trump’s administration has been engaged in a trade conflict with China, with both countries imposing tariffs on each other’s goods. US tariffs on Chinese imports have reached 145 per cent, while China has responded with a 125 per cent tariff band on American products.On Friday, the US appeared to ease some pressure by announcing temporary tariff exemptions for products such as smartphones, laptops, and semiconductors, many of which are sourced from China. These exemptions are expected to benefit US tech firms like Nvidia, Dell, and Apple, which manufacture several of their products in China.However, President Trump and his aides clarified that these exemptions are not permanent. Trump said on Sunday that the move was being misunderstood and that his administration is working on new tariffs that could apply to items recently exempted. ""The tariffs will be in place in the not distant future,"" he said.Earlier, China’s commerce ministry responded to the exemptions by saying that the move only ""represents a small step"" and urged the US to ""completely cancel"" its entire tariff policy.Meanwhile, Chinese President Xi Jinping, during a visit to Vietnam at the start of his Southeast Asia tour on Monday, cautioned that protectionist policies ""will lead nowhere.""In an article published in a Vietnamese newspaper, Xi called on both countries to ""resolutely safeguard the multilateral trading system, stable global industrial and supply chains, and open and cooperative international environment.""He also repeated China's stance that a ""trade war and tariff war will produce no winner.""","China's customs department said on Monday that while the country is under ""severe"" pressure in its export sector, the situation is not disastrous.

Good riddance: Trump admin reacts to Mahmoud Khalil order



What Mahmoud Khalil said after the ruling



The verdict of the Mahmoud Khalil case was crucial as several international students were detained by ICE after Khalil and are now waiting to be deported. An immigration judge, Jamee E Comans, on Friday ruled that Khalil can be deported as his presence in the US posed ""potentially serious foreign policy consequences"". The judge said the government established by clear and convincing evidence that he is removable.His lawyers said he would not be deported immediately as they would appeal the verdict. Previously, federal judges in New York and New Jersey ordered the government not to deport Khalil while his case remains in court.Tuft University doctoral student from Turkey Rumeysa Ozturkl who was detained by immigration officials near her Massachussets home has been demanding her release. She has filed an updated account of how she was surrounded by ICE officials who grabbed her phone.Rumeysa's case is like Khalil's, though Khalil is a US citizen through his marriage to a US citizen, Dr Noorr Abdallah who is going to be a mother next month.The petition to release her was filed in a Boston court and then it was moved top Vermont, which will be heard on Monday.Ozturk was one of four students who wrote an op-ed in the campus newspaper, The Tufts Daily, last year criticizing the university’s response to student activists demanding that Tufts “acknowledge the Palestinian genocide,” disclose its investments and divest from companies with ties to Israel.DHS secretary Kristi Noem said it will be 'good riddance' once Khalil is deported. ""Mahmoud Khalil hates the United States and what we stand for—so his removal should come as welcome news,"" Noem posted.""It is a privilege to be granted a visa or green card to live and study in the United States of America. When you advocate for violence, glorify and support terrorists that relish the killing of Americans, and harass Jews, that privilege should be revoked, and you should not be in this country,"" Noem posted.""I would like to quote what you said last time that there's nothing that's more important to this court than due process rights and fundamental fairness. Clearly what we witnessed today, neither of these principles were present today or in this whole process. This is exactly why the Trump administration has sent me to this court, 1,000 miles away from my family. I just hope that the urgency that you deemed fit for me are afforded to the hundreds of others who have been here without hearing for months,"" Khalil said.","An immigration judge, Jamee E Comans, on Friday ruled that Khalil can be deported as his presence in the US posed ""potentially serious foreign policy consequences"" Rumeysa Ozturk who was detained by immigration officials near her Massachussets home has been demanding her release.

The Trump administration confirmed on Saturday that Kilmar Abrego Garcia , a Maryland resident mistakenly deported last month, remains confined in a notorious prison in El Salvador but did not provide the full scope of information demanded by a federal judge regarding efforts to bring him back.In a court filing submitted, US state department official Michael G Kozak said that Abrego Garcia is currently being held in the Terrorism Confinement Center in El Salvador, reported news agency Associated Press.“He is alive and secure in that facility. He is detained pursuant to the sovereign, domestic authority of El Salvador,” wrote Kozak, identified in the filing as a “Senior Bureau Official” in the Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs.However, Kozak’s statement failed to address US district judge Paula Xinis’s additional directives. On Friday, the judge had ordered the administration to disclose not only Abrego Garcia’s “current physical location and custodial status” but also “what steps, if any, defendants have taken (and) will take, and when, to facilitate” his return.Xinis had expressed deep frustration over the government’s lack of transparency. “I’m not asking for state secrets. All I know is that he’s not here,” she said during a tense court hearing on Friday, adding, “The government was prohibited from sending him to El Salvador, and now I’m asking a very simple question: Where is he?”As per AP, Friday’s hearing exposed the administration’s failure to provide even basic information about Garcia's whereabouts or the plan for his return, prompting Xinis to demand daily updates from a US official with direct knowledge of the case.Garcia, 29, was deported in March despite a 2019 federal court ruling that prohibited his removal due to the likelihood he would face persecution in El Salvador. The deportation, which was later admitted by a US immigration official to be an “administrative error,” sent him to El Salvador’s CECOT prison , a high-security facility known for holding dangerous criminals.Garcia’s deportation occurred under a $6 million agreement between the Trump administration and the Salvadoran government. The deal allowed US authorities to detain and transfer migrants to Salvadoran custody.","Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident mistakenly deported last month, remains confined in a notorious prison in El Salvador.

A 5.5 magnitude earthquake rattled central Myanmar early Sunday, making frightened residents rush out of their homes in towns near the epicentre. This new quake in the Southeast Asian nation hit just weeks after a powerful 7.7-magnitude temblor on March 28, as one of its strongest aftershocks .The quake struck near Meiktila , a small city in Mandalay Region , according to the US geological survey . Its epicentre lay roughly between Mandalay, Myanmar’s second-largest city, and the capital Naypyitaw—both of which were heavily affected by the quake of March 28.Two residents of Wundwin township, near the epicentre, told The Associated Press by phone that Sunday’s quake was strong enough to shake buildings and damage ceilings. “People rushed out of buildings,” one said. Another resident described cracked walls and minor debris falling indoors.However, in Naypyitaw, a resident told AP that he did not feel tremor.All three people spoke on condition of anonymity, citing fear of angering the military authorities, who have long maintained tight control over information and restrict public criticism—especially during times of crisis.Sunday’s tremor is one of the strongest aftershocks following the March 28 disaster, which killed at least 3,649 people and injured more than 5,000, according to the military government. That quake also flattened villages, severely damaged hospitals, and disrupted farming and transport across several regions.The UN last week warned that the devastation is compounding Myanmar’s existing humanitarian crisis, worsened by ongoing conflict and the displacement of over 3 million people.The earthquake struck as the country marked the beginning of Thingyan, Myanmar’s traditional New Year holiday. Celebrations had already been canceled out of respect for the recent victims.While officials said there were no immediate reports of new casualties.","The quake struck near Meiktila, a small city in Mandalay Region.

Rubble littered a street as rescuers carried one person away from the site, which the rebels claimed was a ceramics factory in the Bani Matar neighborhood of Sanaa, the capital.The US military's Central Command, which oversees American military operations, did not acknowledge the strikes. That follows a pattern for the command, which now has authorization from the White House to conduct strikes at will in the campaign that began March 15.The American military also hasn't been providing any information on targets hit. The White House has said over 200 strikes have been conducted so far.Houthis claim another American drone shot down The Houthis separately claimed Sunday night they shot down an MQ-9 Reaper drone over Yemen's Hajjah governorate, which sits to the northwest of the country on the Red Sea on the country's border with Saudi Arabia.Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree, a Houthi military spokesman, described the downing in a prerecorded video message as the fourth in two weeks by the rebels. Saree said the rebels targeted the drone with ""a locally manufactured missile."" The Houthis have surface-to-air missiles - such as the Iranian missile known as the 358 - capable of downing aircraft.Iran denies arming the rebels, though Tehran-manufactured weaponry has been found on the battlefield and in sea shipments heading to Yemen for the Shiite Houthi rebels despite a United Nations arms embargo.General Atomics Reapers, which cost around $30 million apiece, can fly at altitudes over 40,000 feet (12,100 meters) and remain in the air for over 30 hours. They have been flown by both the US military and the CIA for years over Afghanistan, Iraq and now Yemen.Central Command said it was aware of ""reports"" of the drone being shot down, but did not elaborate.US strikes come as part of monthlong intense campaign An AP review has found the new US operation against the Houthis under President Donald Trump appears more extensive than that under former President Joe Biden, as Washington moves from solely targeting launch sites to firing at ranking personnel and dropping bombs on cities.The new campaign of airstrikes started after the rebels threatened to begin targeting ""Israeli"" ships again over Israel blocking aid entering the Gaza Strip. The rebels have loosely defined what constitutes an Israeli ship, meaning many vessels could be targeted.The Houthis targeted more than 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two of them and killing four sailors from November 2023 until January of this year. They also launched attacks targeting American warships without success.The US campaign shows no signs of stopping, as the Trump administration has also linked its airstrikes on the Houthis to an effort to pressure Iran over its rapidly advancing nuclear program.","Suspected US airstrikes around Yemen's rebel-held capital killed at least six people. Houthis also claimed shooting down another American MQ-9 Reaper drone.

Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa , a towering figure in Latin American literature and winner of the 2010 Nobel Prize in Literature, died on Sunday at the age of 89. His death was confirmed in a statement shared on social media by his son Álvaro Vargas Llosa.“It is with deep sorrow that we announce that our father, Mario Vargas Llosa , passed away peacefully in Lima today, surrounded by his family,” read the statement signed by his children Álvaro, Gonzalo and Morgana.The family said there would be no public ceremony and that his remains would be cremated. “His departure will sadden his relatives, his friends and his readers around the world, but we hope that they will find comfort, as we do, in the fact that he enjoyed a long, adventurous and fruitful life, and leaves behind him a body of work that will outlive him,” the statement added.Vargas Llosa was known for novels such as The Time of the Hero, Conversation in the Cathedral, and Feast of the Goat, works that explored power, corruption, and the contradictions of Peruvian society. His debut novel, The Time of the Hero (1963), based on his experience at a military academy, provoked national controversy and was partly burned by military officers who labelled him a communist.He was a leading voice of the Latin American literary “Boom” alongside Gabriel García Márquez and Carlos Fuentes, gaining global recognition for his ability to intertwine personal stories with sweeping political commentary.Born Jorge Mario Pedro Vargas Llosa on March 28, 1936, in Arequipa, Peru, he spent his early childhood in Bolivia with his mother and grandmother. He later discovered that his father—previously believed to be dead—was alive, and the family reunited in Lima when Vargas Llosa was ten.He was sent to the Leoncio Prado Military Academy, an experience he described as “like discovering hell,” which later served as the basis for his first novel. He studied literature and law at San Marcos University in Lima and later earned a doctorate in Madrid.His career spanned decades and continents, with residences in Paris, New York, and Madrid. He was also a political commentator and columnist, penning the influential “Piedra de Toque” column, and evolved from youthful communist affiliations to becoming a staunch critic of authoritarianism and leftist regimes in Latin America.In 1990, Vargas Llosa ran for president of Peru but lost to Alberto Fujimori, a political outsider who later became a controversial authoritarian leader. Though he never held office, his political views influenced much of his later work and public life.His novels often depicted Peru's complex social fabric, from Amazonian tribes to crumbling aristocracies. Later works, such as The Way to Paradise and The Dream of the Celt, explored historical figures like Paul Gauguin and Roger Casement .Vargas Llosa was twice married and had three children. His high-profile relationship with Spanish socialite Isabel Preysler, mother of singer Enrique Iglesias, ended in 2022.His final novel, Harsh Times (2019), tackled US intervention in Guatemala. Despite critics’ disapproval of his political shift, Vargas Llosa remained a literary force into his late 80s, his works continuing to provoke thought and admiration across the world.","Mario Vargas Llosa, winner of the 2010 Nobel Prize in Literature, died on Sunday at the age of 89.

‘Tariffs don’t bring manufacturing back. They’re just a tax on Americans’: China targets US public amid escalating trade war,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/tariffs-dont-bring-manufacturing-back-theyre-just-a-tax-on-americans-china-targets-us-public-amid-escalating-trade-war/articleshow/120266278.cms,"As tensions deepen in the US-China trade war , Beijing appears to be shifting tactics by addressing the American public directly, instead of engaging solely with the Trump administration. In its latest effort, China has launched a social media campaign to counter the prevailing belief among many Americans that tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump primarily hurt foreign economies.Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning posted a video on X (formerly Twitter) featuring a man portrayed as a US importer. The video targets American citizens, particularly Trump supporters, with a warning that tariffs on Chinese imports ultimately burden US consumers. “Foreign countries pay the tariffs? No – US businesses pay, then pass costs to you. Tariffs don’t bring manufacturing back. They’re just a tax on Americans,” Mao wrote in the caption.The message was timed alongside renewed hostilities in the ongoing trade dispute. On Wednesday, Trump announced an increase in tariffs on Chinese goods to 145%, prompting a retaliatory move from Beijing, which raised its own tariffs on American imports to 125% by Friday. The tit-for-tat measures have pushed bilateral trade—valued at over $650 billion in 2024—toward a potential breakdown, analysts warn.While Trump insists the tariffs are paid by foreign exporters—telling reporters on Air Force One, “We can set the tariff, and they can choose not to deal with us or they can choose to pay it”—economists and trade experts point out that the importers, not foreign suppliers, shoulder the cost. These costs are usually passed on to consumers through higher prices.Still, Trump has left the door open for negotiations. “The president made it very clear: When the United States is punched, he will punch back harder,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Friday, even as Trump praised Chinese President Xi Jinping, suggesting a deal might be possible.Meanwhile, in a separate move, the Trump administration announced exemptions for certain electronics from the punitive tariffs, providing relief for major tech companies like Apple and Dell. The US Customs and Border Protection agency issued a notice listing 20 product categories—including computers, semiconductors, memory chips and displays—that will be excluded retroactively from April 5.The exemption also applies to Trump’s 10% “baseline” tariffs on imports from most countries, excluding China, effectively lowering costs on key tech components from Taiwan and India.","Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning posted a video on X (formerly Twitter) featuring a man portrayed as a US importer.

Tariff pause: Freight rates may rise on 'front-loading',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/tariff-pause-freight-rates-may-rise-on-front-loading/articleshow/120265353.cms,"NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump's reciprocal tariff policy could significantly drive up freight rates for Indian exporters , fuelled by front-loading of orders amid a volatile and uncertain global trade environment .With the 90-day tariff pause on imports from India, freight rates could see an initial double-digit spike as exporters rush to book consignments, industry experts said. This increase, adding to India Inc's cost burden, could mirror global trends, where freight rates rose 3% to $2,265 per 40-feet container (as per Drewry's World Container Index) last week.On April 9, Trump announced a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs, lowering them to 10% for several countries, including India, but excluding China. Ajay Sahai, DG and CEO of the Federation of Indian Export Organisations, told TOI: ""The exporters' rush to ship consignments before the 90-day deadline is expected to lead to a double-digit spike in freight rates to the US. Post-deadline, rates could soften.""For now, the industry is in a wait-and-watch mode. Christian Roeloffs, co-founder and CEO of Container xChange, an online container logistics platform for container trading, leasing, and management, said: ""Prices are increasing right now, both in typical loading as well as in discharging locations. Essentially, the uncertainty and cancelled shipments are soaking up container inventory. Our members are very much in a wait-and-see mode. Most of them are still expecting structural container price decreases.""Industry experts noted that the domestic container logistics sector stands at a critical juncture, grappling with global trade disruptions and Red Sea instability, leaving stakeholders uncertain about operational stability. Moreover, India relies heavily on leasing containers from foreign players, particularly China. The recent push for domestic shipbuilding, backed by a Rs 25,000 crore Maritime Development Fund, could change this, but industry experts caution that true self-reliance will take years.The volatility and complexity of the shifting policy landscape place global logistics at the forefront, highlighting the importance of agile and robust supply chains amid trade tensions. ""It's crunch time for transport and logistics companies, and we are fully geared up for the task. We have often faced challenging situations where companies' supply chains were put to the test - and we are well-equipped to deliver solutions. We have previously seen that an integrated logistics portfolio and control over our own assets become crucial when the unexpected creates a need to either slow down or speed up,"" says Karsten Kildahl, global chief commercial officer of AP Moller-Maersk.","US President Donald Trump's reciprocal tariff policy could significantly drive up freight rates for Indian exporters.

A New Jersey restaurateur , previously convicted of acting as an unregistered agent of the Chinese government, is now in the custody of US immigration and customs enforcement (ICE), facing likely deportation.Ming Xi Zhang , a 61-year-old Chinese national and owner of Ya Ya Noodles in Montgomery Township , was arrested on March 24 in Newark, New Jersey, reported the New York Post.Zhang, widely known in his community as “Sushi John,” pleaded guilty in May 2021 to operating as an agent of China in 2016 without informing the US attorney general, a direct violation of the Foreign Agents Registration Act .According to ICE, Zhang lawfully entered the US through Los Angeles International Airport in June 2000 but later “violated the terms of his lawful admission.”As per FAIRUS.org, Zhang admitted to meeting with Chinese security operatives in the Bahamas in 2016 and later delivering $35,000 to a person in New Jersey. He also hosted a Chinese government agent twice at his Princeton-area home. His activities remain partly shrouded in secrecy as court records are sealed.On April 30, 2024, Zhang was sentenced by a federal judge to three years of probation and fined $10,000. His release on a $150,000 bond following the 2021 plea came with the condition that he could be removed from the US.“Any illegal alien conducting activities related to espionage, sabotage or export control against the United States is subject to deportation,” said ICE Newark field office Director John Tsoukaris.He is now being held at the Elizabeth Detention Center as he awaits immigration proceedings. Despite the serious charges, Zhang’s restaurant has remained open and local support appears strong. “The whole town has been really supportive,” a staff member was quoted saying by The New York Post. “Everyone’s been coming in, offering phone numbers, talking to his family”, the member added.Zhang’s case comes amid a broader Trump administration effort to tighten immigration enforcement and remove individuals deemed national security threats. Similar recent arrests have raised concerns about a growing pattern of Chinese nationals attempting to access sensitive US sites, including military bases, according to FAIRUS.org.The department of homeland security had recently warned that Chinese-made internet-connected devices, such as surveillance cameras, could be exploited to spy on or disrupt US infrastructure.","Ming Xi Zhang, a 61-year-old Chinese national, was arrested on March 24 in Newark, New Jersey.

Trump Administration Tariffs: Trump warns 'no one is off the hook' despite Lutnick's claim of electronics getting temporary tariff reprieve,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-warns-no-one-is-off-the-hook-despite-lutnicks-claim-of-electronics-getting-temporary-tariff-reprieve/articleshow/120263957.cms,"File photo: US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick (left) and US President Donald Trump (Picture credit: AP)

US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick on Sunday said the Trump administration’s decision to temporarily exempt electronics like smartphones and laptops from steep new import tariffs was not permanent and that the products would soon fall under a new policy targeting the semiconductor sector.“They’re exempt from the reciprocal tariffs but they’re included in the semiconductor tariffs, which are coming in probably a month or two,” Lutnick told ABC’s ‘This Week’, making it clear the brief relief for consumer electronics was only a pause before a more targeted approach.The White House on Friday had excluded several electronics from the wide-ranging “reciprocal tariffs” introduced earlier this month, in a move that was expected to benefit tech giants like Apple, Samsung, and Nvidia. The exemption included devices such as smartphones, laptops, flat-panel monitors, hard drives, and chips, according to a US Customs and Border Protection bulletin.Semiconductor manufacturing machines were also spared from immediate levies.But just hours after Lutnick’s clarification, US President Donald Trump directly contradicted the idea of any exemption. In a post on Truth Social, he declared there was no tariff “exception” at all, saying the goods were merely being moved to a different category and would still face a 20% tariff.“Nobody is getting off the hook,” Trump wrote. “We will not be held hostage by other Countries, especially hostile trading Nations like China.”As per AFP, the White House now plans to launch a new wave of national security investigations aimed at the broader electronics and semiconductor supply chain, part of a push to reshore key industries. Lutnick reinforced that view, saying, “We need to have semiconductors… made in America. We can’t be reliant on Southeast Asia for all the things that operate for us.”The temporary reprieve comes as part of a confusing sequence of tariff changes by the Trump administration, with sharp reversals sparking uncertainty for companies and investors alike. Lutnick confirmed the administration was crafting a separate tariff model “in order to encourage” semiconductor and pharmaceutical manufacturing in the US.Some analysts saw Friday’s exemptions as a response to backlash over rising tech costs. According to AP, the administration’s sweeping tariffs had battered the market value of the tech industry's “Magnificent Seven” — including Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Tesla, Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon, with a $2.1 trillion drop from April 2. That loss narrowed after Trump paused tariffs for countries outside China, but Friday’s contradictory messaging cast new doubts.China, meanwhile, has urged the US to drop the tariffs altogether. As per AFP, Beijing’s commerce ministry said the Friday exemption “represents a small step” and warned that the US should “completely cancel” its aggressive trade strategy.While Trump has promised to provide further details on Monday, officials have confirmed that China remains excluded from any wider tariff pause. According to AFP, there are no plans yet for talks between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping.Trump is expected to clarify the administration’s stance on electronics and semiconductors further on Monday.","US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick on Sunday said the Trump administration’s decision to temporarily exempt electronics from steep new import tariffs was not permanent.

Donald Trump: Donald Trump has no plans to speak with Xi Jinping as tariff battle with China deepens,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-has-no-plans-to-speak-with-xi-jinping-as-tariff-battle-with-china-deepens/articleshow/120262418.cms,"File photo: Chinese President Xi Jinping (left) and US President Donald Trump (Picture credit: AP)

US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping currently have no plans to hold talks amid an intensifying trade war, confirmed trade representative Jamieson Greer during an appearance on CBS News’ “Face the Nation” on Sunday.Greer said the issue now rests ""at the leaders' level"" and that any future engagement would occur only “at some point,” as President Trump has suggested.This comes in the wake of Trump’s April 2 announcement, dubbed “Liberation Day”, when the US imposed a 10% baseline tariff on all foreign goods, alongside higher “reciprocal” tariffs targeting countries that tax US exports.Shortly after, Trump announced a 90-day pause on most of the new tariffs after markets plunged, but simultaneously hiked the tariff on Chinese imports to 125% and slapped an additional 20% fentanyl duty, bringing China’s total to 145%.China responded on Friday by raising tariffs on American goods from 84% to 125%. According to CBS News, China condemned the move, calling the escalating levies a “joke” and accusing Washington of violating international trade norms.Greer defended the administration’s approach, emphasising that Trump’s tariff plan is part of a broader strategy to reshore US manufacturing and reduce reliance on China. “The only reason we’re really in this position right now is because China chose to retaliate,” Greer said in the interview. “So many other countries affirmatively said they did not want to retaliate, they want to negotiate… China made a different decision. They have agency here”, he added.Greer also noted that negotiations had already been in progress with over 70 countries before the tariffs took effect, acknowledging that talks are ongoing “around the clock.”When asked whether the US would push China to sell its estimated $1.5 trillion in US assets, Greer said that was “not part of the plan.” Instead, he stressed the need for economic resilience and noted that “we’ve become so dependent on China” without fair market access for decades.China’s countermeasures follow Trump’s warning that further retaliation would lead to even harsher tariffs.Last week, the White House announced an electronics exemption for Chinese imports, only for commerce secretary Howard Lutnick to declare that the exemption was temporary, signalling further tariff hikes could follow.While Xi Jinping embarks on a diplomatic tour of Southeast Asia this week to strengthen trade ties, with visits to Vietnam, Malaysia, and Cambodia, no signs point to an immediate thaw in US-China tensions.","US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping currently have no plans to hold talks amid an intensifying trade war.

However, if you are Lauren Sanchez - journalist, pilot, children's book author, philanthropist and fiancee of Jeff Bezos, the second-richest man on the planet - you have another idea. You think, ""Let's reimagine the flight suit."" ""Usually, you know, these suits are made for a man,"" Sanchez said. ""Then they get tailored to fit a woman."" Or not tailored: an all-female spacewalk, planned in 2019, had to be cancelled because Nasa did not have two spacesuits that fit two women. (Instead they sent out one woman and one man.)But Sanchez is part of the first all-female flight since Russia sent Valentina Tereshkova on a solo flight in 1963. She will be going up on a Blue Origin flight with a pop star (Katy Perry), a journalist (Gayle King), two scientist/activists (Amanda Nguyen, Aisha Bowe) and a film producer (Kerianne Flynn). Feeling like yourself is what makes you feel powerful, she said, and you shouldn't have to sacrifice that because space has been - well, a mostly male space. Even if you are a space tourist, rather than a full-fledged astronaut.So, five months ago, Sanchez got in touch with Fernando Garcia and Laura Kim, co-founders of Monse, who are also creative directors of Oscar de la Renta's (Garcia and Kim made Sanchez's 2024 Met Gala outfit).The result of their collaboration will be unveiled Monday, when Sanchez and crew climb into the Blue Origin rocket in West Texas, and take off for their approximately 11-minute trip past the Karman line and into zero gravity. ""I think the suits are elegant,"" Sanchez said, ""but they also bring a little spice to space."" When Gayle King tried hers on, she said, she loved it. She thought the suits looked ""professional and feminine at the same time."" Nguyen called the suits ""revolutionary."" Clothes are about identity and representation, she said, and by allowing women to look like women, the suits are a statement that ""women belong in space.""As to why designers were suddenly so popular with the astrophysics set, Garcia said, ""if we make suits look approachable and like something anyone could wear, then space might feel a little bit less distant."" Maybe, Garcia said, people might even think they ""want to buy that spacesuit to go to the gym.""Sanchez was excited to give space travel a new look. ""This isn't what you would call 'normal,' but neither is sending six women into space,"" she said.""If you want to do glam, great. If you don't, great."" The point was everyone gets to choose. Then she quoted something she said Perry had told her: ""We're putting the 'a**' in astronaut,"" she said.","Lauren Sanchez is part of the first all-female flight since Russia sent Valentina Tereshkova on a solo flight in 1963.

Baloch separatists kill 8 Pakistanis in Iran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/baloch-separatists-kill-8-pakistanis-in-iran/articleshow/120262403.cms,"ISLAMABAD:

Eight Pakistani car mechanics were shot dead in Iran late Saturday, sparking outrage and deepening fears that the country was becoming a hub for anti-Pakistan militants after Afghanistan.Balochistan National Army (BNA), a lesser-known separatist group, claimed responsibility for the attack in Sistan-Baluchestan province, escalating tensions between the neighbouring countries as Pakistan demanded swift action. The eight workers hailed from Punjab -- Pakistan’s most populous province -- and were killed at a workshop in Mehrestan district, near Afghanistan’s border, Pakistani authorities said.BNA framed the killings as retaliation against perceived Punjabi dominance in Balochistan’s economic and political spheres. “We will not allow outsiders to exploit our land and resources,” BNA said in an online statement, echoing long-standing Baloch grievances over resource exploitation and marginalisation. The outfit has aligned itself with the broader Baloch insurgency led by groups like Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA).Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif called the attack “barbaric”. “We demand the perpetrators be brought to justice swiftly,” he said, urging Tehran to act. Sharif ordered the foreign ministry to help the victims’ families and repatriate the bodies. Foreign minister Ishaq Dar issued a similar condemnation. “This attack challenges our sovereignty. We cannot allow our citizens to be targeted abroad,” Dar said.Iran’s response was measured but conspicuously vague. Ambassador Reza Amiri Moghadam condemned the killings as “inhumane and cowardly”, calling terrorism a “chronic plight” that demands regional cooperation. Yet, Tehran offered no concrete assurances of cracking down on groups like BNA, prompting scepticism in Islamabad.Thousands of Pakistanis, particularly from economically deprived areas, travel to Iran on a regular basis to take up informal jobs in sectors such as vehicle repairs, construction, and agriculture.In Jan 2024, nine Pakistani labourers were killed and three critically injured in a similar attack in Saravancity, also located in Iran’s southeastern border region. Like in the latest killings, the victims in that case worked in an automobile repair shop. These murders occurred at a time when Pakistan and Iran were attempting to repair diplomatic relations after tit-for-tat missile and drone attacks.","Balochistan National Army (BNA), a lesser-known separatist group, claimed responsibility for the attack.

ISLAMABAD: Bilawal Bhutto Zardari has been re-elected as Chairman of the Pakistan People's Party (PPP) for the next four years after the party's intra-party elections held at the Central Secretariat in Islamabad, The Express Tribune reported.The elections were conducted according to the PPP's constitution and finalised key leadership positions for the next four years. In addition, Humayun Khan was chosen as PPP's Secretary General, and Nadeem Afzal Chan was elected Secretary of Information.Aamna Piracha has been chosen as Secretary Finance, completing the list of newly appointed senior officials, The Express Tribune reported. According to the PPP's internal electoral framework, all party officials were elected for a four-year term.Earlier on April 4, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari said that the PPP rejected the government's canal project, terming it ""unilateral"" and warning that it would harm farmers in Punjab, Dawn reported.On February 15, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz and Chief of the Army Staff General Asim Munir inaugurated the Cholistan project to irrigate south Punjab's lands amid public outcry and strong reservations in Sindh.Meanwhile, in March, the Sindh Assembly unanimously passed a resolution against building six new canals on the Indus River. The resolution also demanded an immediate halt to any plans or work related to the project until an agreement with all provincial governments, especially Sindh, was reached to ensure that the province's rights were fully protected and respected.While addressing a PPP rally in Garhi Khuda Bakhsh on the anniversary of Pakistan's former Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's execution, Bhutto said that the PPP had always fought for peoples' rights to water, Dawn reported.He said, ""The workers of the PPP have grown old fighting for the fair distribution of water."" Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari said, ""Be it Musharraf's unilateral canal proposal, or that of the PTI founder, there is no forum where we have not taken up our struggle."" He stated that the IRSA report shows there are water shortages in Punjab also, Dawn reported.He said, ""If we take water from here (Sindh), it'll harm farmers in South Punjab.

The move adds to the existing challenges and struggles for the citizens, who are faced with a towering inflation, which is aggravated by consistent job losses in the private sector, and now the govt sectors as well.According to reliable sources in the Punjab school education department, it will now be up to the private sector owners to hire teachers according to their policy. On the other hand, teachers say that the decision will add to growing unemployment among youth. ians","The education department of the Punjab province in Pakistan has abolished 44,000 posts of govt schoolteachers as part of its outsourcing campaign to the private sector.

Poll Do you believe that Pakistan is adequately prepared for earthquakes? No Yes

A moderate-intensity earthquake with a magnitude of 5.8 struck Pakistan at around 1 pm on Saturday, with tremors felt in Jammu and Kashmir.Tremors were felt across many parts of the Valley, but there were no immediate reports of casualties or property damage. The earthquake occurred at a depth of 10 kilometres, with coordinates of 33.63 degrees North latitude and 72.46 degrees East longitude.According to the National Center for Seismology (NCS), the recent earthquake struck at a shallow depth of 10km, increasing the likelihood of aftershocks.Shallow earthquakes are typically more dangerous than deeper ones because the seismic waves travel a shorter distance to the surface, causing stronger ground shaking and potentially more damage to structures and higher casualties.Pakistan, located on the boundary of the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates, is one of the most seismically active countries. The nation frequently experiences destructive earthquakes due to its position on major fault lines. Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, and Gilgit-Baltistan lie on the southern edge of the Eurasian plate, while Sindh, Punjab, and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir are on the north-western edge of the Indian plate. The collision of these plates makes the region highly susceptible to violent earthquakes.Earlier, Pakistan’s neighbor Tajikistan was also jolted by a 4.2 magnitude earthquake.","A moderate-intensity earthquake with a magnitude of 5.8 struck Pakistan at around 1 pm on Saturday, with tremors felt in Jammu and Kashmir.

Poll Should the Pakistani military have a role in politics? No, it undermines democracy. Yes, they provide stability.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s political landscape remains a battleground of competing forces, with the military, former prime minister Imran Khan, and the current govt under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif locked in a tense struggle.The interplay of US foreign policy and the Pakistani diaspora’s growing voice adds further complexity to a nation grappling with economic woes, security threats and democratic erosion.Imran Khan, ousted in April 2022 via a no-confidence vote, continues to challenge the status quo from behind bars. Convicted on corruption and state secret charges, the cricketer-turned-politician retains a fervent base, accusing the military and Sharif’s govt of colluding with the US to orchestrate his downfall.Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) alleges widespread rigging in the Feb 2024 elections, which saw Sharif’s Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) secure power through a fragile coalition. PTI supporters, galvanised by Khan’s claims, have staged protests, clashing with the security forces and deepening the political divide.The military, longtime kingmaker in Pakistani politics, appears to have shifted allegiance. Once Khan’s backer in his 2018 rise, the army soured on him after policy disputes and his public criticisms of General Asim Munir, the current army chief.Analysts suggest the military now props up Sharif’s govt, a dynamic evident in legislative moves like the 2023 Pakistan Army Act amendment, which stifled dissent and empowered the armed forces. This hybrid regime – blending electoral democracy with military influence – has drawn scrutiny for undermining constitutional norms, yet the generals show no sign of relinquishing their grip.However, Shehbaz Sharif, re-elected in March 2024 as PM, faces a legitimacy crisis. His coalition, including the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) and other smaller factions, struggles to address surging militant attacks, crumbling infrastructure, and an economy reliant on IMF bailouts.Sharif vows to mend ties with Washington but his govt’s dependence on military support raises questions about its autonomy. Khan’s call for an election audit, echoed in a letter to the IMF, threatens to derail these efforts as Pakistan awaits a critical loan installment.The US role remains contentious. Khan’s unproven claims of a Washington-led conspiracy resonate with a populace wary of foreign interference, a sentiment rooted in decades of strained relations. The Biden administration, while engaging Sharif’s govt, has maintained robust military ties with Pakistan, prioritising counter-terrorism over democratic concerns. This ambivalence has fuelled Khan’s narrative, even as US officials dismiss his allegations.Meanwhile, the Pakistani diaspora, particularly in the US, has emerged as a vocal force. Pro-democracy activists, many aligned with PTI, have lobbied Congress, securing bipartisan support for resolutions condemning elections irregularities and Khan’s detention. Over 100 lawmakers have urged his release, while some advocate sanctions against military leaders like Munir. This diaspora-driven pressure marks a shift, challenging the traditional US-Pakistan security nexus.As Pakistan teeters between chaos and stability, the military’s shadow looms large, Khan’s defiance endures, and Sharif’s govt navigates a treacherous path. With the US and Pakistani diaspora adding external weight, the nation’s democratic future hangs in the balance.","Imran Khan, ousted in April 2022 via a no-confidence vote, continues to challenge the status quo from behind bars.

Poll Do you support the call for a long march by Sardar Akhtar Mengal? No, I do not support it. Yes, I support it.

ISLAMABAD: A tense standoff unfolded across Balochistan on Monday as a shutter-down strike and widespread road blockades sparked by nationalist leader Sardar Akhtar Mengal ’s call for a “long march” from Lakpass to Quetta paralysed the Pakistani province.The protest by Akhtar’s Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M), now in its second week, demands the release of detained Baloch activists, including women leaders of Balochistan Yakjehti Committee (BYC), amid escalating clashes with authorities.Shops businesses and schools remained closed in cities like Quetta, Kalat, Mastung Khuzdar, and Gwadar. Mengal’s supporters blocked key highways, including the Quetta-Karachi national highway.The provincial govt’s deployment of containers, trenches, and police checkpoints at Lakpass, roughly 30 km from Quetta, stalled the march, forcing demonstrators onto rugged mountain routes.Reports of police using teargas and shelling BNP-M workers have intensified the unrest.Mengal, addressing a sit-in at Lakpass, accused the state of oppression and vowed to press forward. “The state may crush us, but we won’t bow,” he declared, signalling plans to escalate the march into province-wide resistance. The protest began March 28 in Wadh, Mengal’s hometown, following the arrest of BYC leaders, including Mahrang Baloch, during a crackdown on their Quetta sit-in. A suicide bombing near the rally on March 29 left Mengal unharmed but underscored the volatile stakes.Balochistan’s govt, led by chief minister Sarfraz Bugti, has taken a hard line. His spokesperson, Shahid Rind, warned Mengal of arrest under the Maintenance of Public Order (MPO) Act if the march entered Quetta’s Red Zone.Negotiations have faltered, with Mengal dismissing the provincial govt’s delegations as powerless to meet demands. BYC, however, rallied behind Mengal, urging highway blockades and strikes to amplify pressure.Analysts see it as a critical juncture for Balochistan, where grievances over state repression, enforced disappearances and resource exploitation fuel dissent. The shutter-down has disrupted public life, with Quetta’s land links to 12 districts severed for over a week. With cellular networks down and security tightened, the province braces for what Mengal’s supporters call a defining fight.","The protest by Akhtar’s Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M), now in its second week, demands the release of detained Baloch activists.

Ice stupas

Harvest seasons multiply

HUSSAINABAD: At the foot of Pakistan's impossibly high mountains whitened by frost all year round, farmers grappling with a lack of water have created their own ice towers.Warmer winters as a result of climate change has reduced the snow fall and subsequent seasonal snowmelt that feeds the valleys of Gilgit-Baltistan, a remote region home to K2, the world's second-highest peak.Farmers in the Skardu valley, at an altitude of up to 2,600 metres (8,200 feet) in the shadow of the Karakoram mountain range, searched online for help in how to irrigate their apple and apricot orchards.""We discovered artificial glaciers on YouTube,"" Ghulam Haider Hashmi told AFP.They watched the videos of Sonam Wangchuk , an environmental activist and engineer in the Indian region of Ladakh, less than 200 kilometres away across a heavily patrolled border, who developed the technique about 10 years ago.Water is piped from streams into the village, and sprayed into the air during the freezing winter temperatures.""The water must be propelled so that it freezes in the air when temperatures drop below zero, creating ice towers,"" said Zakir Hussain Zakir, a professor at the University of Baltistan.The ice forms in the shape of cones that resemble Buddhist stupas, and act as a storage system -- steadily melting throughout spring when temperatures rise.Gilgit-Baltistan has 13,000 glaciers -- more than any other country on Earth outside the polar regions.Their beauty has made the region one of the country's top tourist destinations -- towering peaks loom over the Old Silk Road, still visible from a highway transporting tourists between cherry orchards, glaciers and ice-blue lakes.Sher Muhammad, a specialist in the Hindu Kush-Himalayan mountain range that stretches from Afghanistan to Myanmar, however said most of the region's water supply comes from snow melt in spring, with a fraction from annual glacial melt in summers.""From late October until early April, we were receiving heavy snowfall. But in the past few years, it's quite dry,"" Muhammad, a researcher at the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), told AFP.The first ""ice stupas"" in Gilgit-Baltistan were created in 2018.Now, more than 20 villages make them every winter, and ""more than 16,000 residents have access to water without having to build reservoirs or tanks"", said Rashid-ud-Din, provincial head of GLOF-2, a UN-Pakistan plan to adapt to the effects of climate change.Farmer Muhammad Raza told AFP that eight stupas were built in his village of Hussainabad this winter, trapping approximately 20 million litres of water in the ice.""We no longer have water shortages during planting,"" he said, since the open-air reservoirs appeared on the slopes of the valley.""Before, we had to wait for the glaciers to melt in June to get water, but the stupas saved our fields,"" said Ali Kazim, also a farmer in the valley.Before the stupas, ""we planted our crops in May"", said 26-year-old Bashir Ahmed who grows potatoes, wheat and barley in nearby Pari village which has also adopted the method.And ""we only had one growing season, whereas now we can plant two or three times"" a year.Temperatures in Pakistan rose twice as fast between 1981 and 2005 compared to the global average, putting the country on the front line of climate change impacts, including water scarcity.Its 240 million inhabitants live in a territory that is 80 percent arid or semi-arid and depends on rivers and streams originating in neighbouring countries for more than three-quarters of its water.Glaciers are melting rapidly in Pakistan and across the world, with a few exceptions including the Karakoram mountain range, increasing the risk of flooding and reducing water supply over the long term.""Faced with climate change, there are neither rich nor poor, neither urban nor rural; the whole world has become vulnerable,"" said 24-year-old Yasir Parvi.""In our village, with the ice stupas, we decided to take a chance.""","Warmer winters as a result of climate change has reduced the snow fall and subsequent seasonal snowmelt that feeds the valleys of Gilgit-Baltistan.

Which are the most affected regions?



What are the consequences of the rising violence?



More than 100 deadly attacks in Pakistan by Islamist militants and separatist rebels made March the deadliest month over a decade with 335 people killed, a think tank reported Thursday.Of the deaths, 228 were caused by militant groups, according to a report by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) think tank. They included 73 members of security services, including soldiers and police officers, 67 civilians and 88 militants.The Islamist-militant Pakistani Taliban, or Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), and the separatist rebel Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) were the main militant groups responsible for the attacks.The BLA was responsible for a 28-hour hijacking of the train Jaffar Express in the southwestern region Balochistan. Some 450 people were held hostage and more than two dozen were killed.Balochistan was the most affected province, followed by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in the northwest of Pakistan.They have both also been targets of suicide bombings, a form of attacks that surged in March.In Punjab, the eastern province bordering India, the think tank observed a strong increase in militant activity.At least seven attacks were recorded, and most were attributed to the TTP.In response to the growing threat, Pakistan's security forces have intensified their operations in the region. Many people have been arrested with connections to militant groups, including the TTP.Islamabad claims that most attacks, both by militants and rebels, are planned and executed from Afghanistan. It accuses the neighboring country of granting Pakistani militants space to plan and organize attacks.A recent report by the United Nations supported this claim. It said that the Taliban provided support to the TTP and that some attacks were launched from Afghan territory.As a consequence, the Pakistani government has urged the ruling Taliban in Afghanistan to act against the allegedly responsible criminals. Kabul, on the other hand, denies that the militants are in Afghanistan.","Of the deaths, 228 were caused by militant groups, according to a report by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies.

He maintains his innocence, asserting that the charges are politically driven.","Imran Khan has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for his contributions to human rights and democratic values.

Pakistan said it killed 10 civilians during an anti-militant operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on Saturday.The operation, in Katlang, a remote hilltop area in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, was aimed at militant hideouts and resulted in the deaths of 12 suspected terrorists.

Bangladesh on Sunday issued an arrest warren against British MP Tulip Siddiq over allegations linked to a widening corruption probe involving her aunt, the ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina The warrant issued by the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC), accuses Siddiq of unlawfully acquiring land through political influence , The Financial Times reported.The Hampstead and Highgate MP is among more than 50 individuals named in connection with the investigation, which centres on alleged misuse of state property during Hasina’s regime, removed from power last August after mass protests.The ACC claims Siddiq and her family received a 7,200 sq ft plot in Dhaka’s diplomatic zone and were involved in securing multiple land allocations via Hasina’s government. The case also includes allegations related to a 2013 nuclear power deal with Russia, where Siddiq is accused of helping inflate the project cost, reported BBC.Siddiq has strongly denied any wrongdoing. In a statement via her lawyers at Stephenson Harwood , she said she has ""never had a plot of land in Bangladesh"" and ""has never influenced any allocation of plots of land to her family members or anyone else.""Her legal team insisted the charges are “completely false” and “politically motivated”, adding that neither Siddiq nor her lawyers had been contacted formally by the ACC or informed of any hearing or warrant.The warrant reportedly stems from her non-attendance at a Dhaka court hearing earlier this week, as per the Financial Times. Her legal representatives argue she had no knowledge of the hearing or prior summons.Siddiq resigned in January as city minister following scrutiny over her ties to the Hasina regime.The accusations have ignited political backlash in the UK. A Conservative Party spokesperson said, “If it is the case that Keir Starmer’s choice for anti-corruption minister is the subject of an international arrest warrant for corruption, she should immediately stand down as Labour MP.” The party also criticised Starmer’s reported openness to her returning to government, according to The Guardian.Siddiq has maintained she is being targeted as part of a broader political campaign against Hasina's family. ACC chair Mohammad Abdul Momen rejected these claims, was quoted by BBC that the investigation is based on “documentary evidence” and that Siddiq “must not shy away from the court proceedings.”Bangladesh does not have a formal extradition treaty with the UK, though it is listed as a 2B extradition country, meaning clear evidence must be shown for any legal action to proceed.","Bangladesh issues an arrest warrant against British MP Tulip Siddiq.

Bangladesh's interim government announced on Sunday it has reintroduced the ""except Israel"" inscription on the country's passports, formally debarring its citizens from travelling to the Jewish state.“We issued the letter to the passport and immigration department on April 7,” Nilima Afroze, deputy secretary of the Bangladesh home ministry, told the state-run Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha (BSS) news agency.The statement ""THIS PASSPORT IS VALID FOR ALL COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD EXCEPT ISRAEL"" was dropped from the official travel documents in May 2021 during the tenure of the Awami League government of then-Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. In August last year, the government collapsed after Hasina resigned and came to India following weeks of student-led protests against her.The caretaker administration led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus took charge on August 8, three days after Hasina's ouster.According to BSS, the authorities at the time had said the purpose was to ""maintain international standards of the document"" and maintained there would be ""no change"" to Dhaka's decades-long policy of travel ban to Israel.However, after the text was removed, Bangladeshi nationals were allowed travel to Israel from a third country if they could obtain a visa.The two nations do not have diplomatic ties. Dhaka supports an independent Palestine.The inscription has been brought back at a time when there is widespread anger in India's eastern neighbour over Israel's military offensive in Palestine's Gaza Strip.On Saturday, thousands of protesters rallied in the capital Dhaka with Palestinian flags and chanted slogans like ""Free, Free Palestine.""The main protest was held at the Suhrawardy Udyan near the premier Dhaka University. Several protesters ""beat"" the images of US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.The Bangladesh Nationalist Party of former prime minister Khaleda Zia, as well as Islamic groups and other political parties expressed solidarity with the rally.","Bangladesh's interim government has reintroduced the ""except Israel"" inscription on the country's passports.

The Taliban leader said executions were part of Islam, days after four men were killed by gunfire in Afghanistan after they were convicted of murder.The executions took place in sports stadiums Friday, the highest number known to have been carried out in one day since the Taliban returned to power in 2021. Rights groups and the U.N. condemned the killings.Taliban leader Hibatullah Akhundzada has previously rejected the need for Western laws in Afghanistan.In an audio clip released Sunday by the Taliban's chief spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid on X, Akhundzada said: ""We must carry out disciplinary measures, perform prayers and acts of worship. We must enter Islam completely. Islam is not just limited to a few rituals; it is a comprehensive system of all divine commands.""Not a single command of Islam should be left unfulfilled, he told a seminar of Hajj instructors during a 45-minute speech in southern Kandahar province.God had commanded people to pray and to enforce his punishments, said Akhundzada, adding that the Taliban did not wage war for power or wealth but rather to ""implement Islamic law "". He rejected criticism of the executions.Afghanistan's Supreme Court earlier ruled that the four men were guilty of murder. A death sentence was handed down after families of the alleged victims refused to grant the men amnesty.Akhundzada's comments come as the Taliban seek greater engagement with the international community, most recently the West.The United States last month lifted bounties on three senior Taliban figures, including the interior minister who also heads a powerful network blamed for bloody attacks against Afghanistan's former Western-backed government.The Taliban have freed four Americans from custody this year, describing these releases as the ""normalization"" of ties between the U.S. and Afghanistan.","Taliban leader Hibatullah Akhundzada has previously rejected the need for Western laws in Afghanistan.

A court in Bangladesh issued a fresh arrest warrant on Thursday against ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina , her daughter Saima Wajed Putul and 17 others in a corruption case, alleging fraudulent acquisition of a residential plot.

A Canada commission report has stated that ""no definitive link"" to a ""foreign state"" has been ""proven"" in the killing of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar , casting doubt on outgoing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's earlier claims of India's involvement in the case.Trudeau had alleged in September 2023 that Canada had ""credible evidence"" of Indian agents' role in Nijjar’s murder in British Columbia that June.However, the report, titled 'Public Inquiry Into Foreign Interference in Federal Electoral Processes and Democratic Institutions', was released on Tuesday and did not establish such a connection.Commissioner Marie-Josee Hogue mentioned in the report that ""disinformation is used as a retaliatory tactic to punish decisions that run contrary to a state's interests.""The findings of report suggest that India may have spread disinformation after Trudeau's announcement.""This may have been the case with a disinformation campaign that followed the Prime Minister's announcement regarding suspected Indian involvement in the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar (though again no definitive link to a foreign state could be proven),"" the report said.Nijjar was shot dead in Surrey, British Columbia, in June 2023.The 123-page report also addressed the expulsion of diplomats.""In October 2024, Canada expelled six Indian diplomats and consular officials in reaction to a targeted campaign against Canadian citizens by agents linked to the Government of India,"" it said. In response, India expelled six Canadian diplomats and withdrew its high commissioner.India-Canada relations have remained strained since Trudeau's 2023 allegations. New Delhi dismissed the claims as ""absurd"" and has frequently criticised Trudeau’s government for its stance on Khalistan supporters in Canada.While the Khalistan movement is banned in India, it has significant backing among sections of the Sikh diaspora, particularly in Canada.On Tuesday, India strongly rejected the report’s ""insinuations."" The ministry of external affairs in New Delhi responded with a firm statement, saying it was in fact Canada that has been ""consistently interfering"" in India's internal affairs.","A Canada commission report has stated that ""no definitive link"" to a ""foreign state"" has been ""proven"" in the killing of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar.

Protecting monuments and public order

US President Donald Trump has reportedly ordered a sweeping law enforcement crackdown on anti-semitism on college campuses, including the deportation of pro-Hamas activists on student visas.According to a report from Fox News, Trump's directive mandates that all federal agencies identify within 60 days the civil and criminal authorities available to combat anti-semitism, ensuring that any anti-Jewish activists who violate the law face prosecution or removal.""It shall be the policy of the United States to combat anti-semitism vigorously, using all available and appropriate legal tools, to prosecute, remove, or otherwise hold to account the perpetrators of unlawful anti-semitic harassment and violence,"" the order states.A White House fact sheet obtained by Fox News indicates that the department of justice will take immediate action to investigate and penalise anti-Jewish discrimination, particularly at what it describes as ""leftist, anti-American colleges and universities.""The announcement comes amid rising tensions on US campuses, where anti-Israel demonstrations intensified after the Oct 7, 2023, Hamas-led attacks on Israel. Recent Republican reports have accused the Biden administration of failing to address anti-semitism at these institutions and of withholding data on visa holders among anti-Israel protestors.In addition to the crackdown on campus anti-semitism, Trump has signed two education-related executive orders. One order will strip federal funding from K-12 schools that teach critical race theory or radical gender ideology, while another supports school choice initiatives.Trump also signed an executive order establishing the White House Task Force on Celebrating America’s 250th Anniversary. The group will plan the US semiquincentennial celebrations set for July 4, 2026.The executive order also reinstates a measure Trump originally signed in June 2020 to protect American monuments and memorials from vandalism and criminal violence. Citing recent incidents of pro-Hamas-related vandalism, the order references attacks on Washington, DC, landmarks, including the treasury department building and Lafayette Square, as well as the Columbus Memorial Fountain and Freedom Bell at Union Station.","US President Donald Trump has reportedly ordered a sweeping law enforcement crackdown on anti-semitism on college campuses.

Did DeepSeek-tied group improperly get OpenAI data?

Software developers can pay for a license to use the API to integrate OpenAI's proprietary AI models into their own applications.Microsoft, an OpenAI technology partner and its largest investor, notified OpenAI of the activity, the sources said. Such activity could violate OpenAI's terms of service or could indicate the group acted to remove OpenAI's restrictions on how much data they could obtain, the people said.DeepSeek earlier this month released a new open-source AI model called R1 that can mimic the way humans reason, upending a market dominated by OpenAI and US rivals such as Google and Meta. The Chinese upstart said R1 rivaled or outperformed leading US developers' products on a range of industry benchmarks and was built at a fraction of the cost.

DOJ official monitors Chicago raids amid sanctuary city crackdown: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/doj-official-monitors-chicago-raids-amid-sanctuary-city-crackdown-report/articleshow/117713606.cms,"File photo: Emil Bove (Picture credit: AP)

Sanctuary city under scrutiny

A top Department of Justice (DOJ) official was in Chicago over the weekend as federal authorities carried out large-scale deportation raids, monitoring for any interference from city officials, reported The New York Post quoting a DOJ source.Acting deputy attorney general Emil Bove travelled to Chicago after warning that the DOJ could investigate and prosecute sanctuary city leaders who obstruct Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations.The crackdown resulted in 100 arrests in pre-dawn raids on Sunday, conducted by ICE alongside the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and other federal agencies.Chicago’s sanctuary policies prohibit local police from assisting federal immigration enforcement in most cases. According to The New York Post, ICE notified the Chicago police department of the general locations of its raids but withheld specifics.Bove recently launched the Sanctuary Cities Working Group, a DOJ initiative tasked with gathering evidence of potential federal law violations by sanctuary cities. The group is also investigating federal funding allocated to such jurisdictions.Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson has remained defiant, vowing to uphold the city’s long-standing sanctuary status. “Regardless of who is in the White House, Chicago is a city that opens its arms to people from around the globe,” Johnson said Tuesday. He reaffirmed that the city would continue protecting immigrants under its “Welcoming City Ordinance.”Adding further, Johnson said, “The Welcoming City Ordinance is a law, and it is the law of the land here in Chicago. We will uphold it, along with the complementary Illinois Trust Act to ensure that our immigrant communities are safe”.The raids come amid heightened tensions between federal authorities and sanctuary city leaders. Tom Homan, former acting ICE director and Trump’s “border czar,” criticised Chicago for what he described as a “well-educated” illegal migrant population.“They’ve been educated on how to defy ICE, how to hide from ICE,” Homan said in an interview with CNN, adding that aid organizations provide pamphlets guiding migrants on how to avoid arrest. “They call it ‘Know Your Rights.’ I call it ‘how to escape arrest,’” he said.As per The New York Post, the House Oversight Committee is also investigating Johnson and other mayors for implementing policies that allegedly obstruct ICE operations.","Acting deputy attorney general Emil Bove travelled to Chicago after warning that the DOJ could investigate and prosecute sanctuary city leaders.

It was often a perverse scene of despair and violence.”She praised Kennedy Jr . for “pulling himself out of illness and disease” but lamented the “siblings and cousins who Bobby encouraged down the path of substance abuse suffered addiction, illness, and death while Bobby has gone on to misrepresent, lie, and cheat his way through life.”“I have never wanted to speak publicly about my family members and their challenges,” she wrote.Robert F.

The Trump administration struggled to clarify which programmes would be affected by the spending pause.Sources speaking anonymously about internal communications confirmed that the OMB cancelled the order through a brief two-sentence notification to government agencies and departments on Wednesday.Officials in the administration explained that the temporary suspension of loans and grants was intended to verify compliance with Trump's recent executive orders. Agencies were required to respond to specific yes-no questions about each federal programme by February 7, including queries about gender ideology promotion and abortion support.The unclear language in the memorandum, coupled with incomplete White House clarifications throughout the day, left government officials, legislators and citizens uncertain about which programmes would face funding interruptions. Even brief funding disruptions could potentially result in job losses or delays in public service delivery.The implementation of the freeze, originally set for 5 pm Tuesday, was temporarily halted by a federal judge until at least Monday, following an emergency session requested by grant-receiving nonprofit organisations. A separate legal challenge from Democratic state attorneys general remained unresolved.Officials from the Trump administration confirmed that direct assistance programmes, including Medicare , Social Security, student loans and food stamps, would continue uninterrupted. However, they faced difficulties in providing precise details.Initially, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt was uncertain about Medicaid's exemption status, though the administration later confirmed its exclusion from the freeze.The impact of Trump's funding pause initiative extended beyond Washington, despite his campaign promises.

The initial directive issued Monday evening created uncertainty regarding vital financial support for states, educational institutions and organisations dependent on substantial federal funding.

Donald Trump appeals against his conviction in hush money case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-appeals-against-his-conviction-in-hush-money-case/articleshow/117701374.cms,"US President Donald Trump has filed an appeal to challenge his hush money conviction to nullify the judgement that made him as the first convicted individual to secure the presidency.Legal representatives submitted an appeal notice on Wednesday, requesting the state's intermediate appeals court to invalidate his May conviction on 34 counts related to business record falsification.Among Trump's various criminal cases, this particular one, concerning an alleged cover-up of a payment to adult film performer Stormy Daniels during his 2016 Republican campaign, was unique in reaching trial.In New York, the appeals process commences with a notice of appeal, after which Trump's attorneys will have the opportunity to present detailed arguments in future court documents.The Manhattan district attorney 's office, which led the prosecution, will be entitled to respond through court submissions.For managing the appeal, Trump has engaged new legal counsel from Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, led by the firm's co-chair Robert J. Giuffra Jr.Giuffra and four colleagues from his firm replaced the president's primary defence attorneys, Todd Blanche and Emil Bove, who were selected for senior positions in his administration's Justice Department.""President Donald J. Trump's appeal is important for the rule of law, New York's reputation as a global business, financial and legal center, as well as for the presidency and all public officials,"" Giuffra said in a statement provided by a Trump spokesperson.""The misuse of the criminal law by the Manhattan DA to target President Trump sets a dangerous precedent, and we look forward to the case being dismissed on appeal.""Trump received an unconditional discharge on January 10, which maintained his conviction whilst avoiding imprisonment, supervision, monetary penalties or additional sanctions.The Republican president had indicated his intention to appeal, which could only proceed post-sentencing.Judge Juan . Merchan had previously dismissed Trump's attempts to nullify the conviction, rejecting arguments based on presidential immunity and his potential return to presidential office.During his virtual sentencing appearance, Trump denounced the proceedings as politically motivated persecution and criticised New York's handling of the case.Last May, a Manhattan jury found Trump guilty of falsifying business documentation within his property development organisation.The charges, whilst technically concerning financial records, were intertwined with controversial elements of Trump's political ascendancy.The prosecution alleged that Trump incorrectly classified reimbursements to his former solicitor Michael Cohen as legal fees, concealing their true purpose: repaying Cohen's $130,000 payment to Daniels for her silence during the 2016 presidential campaign.Daniels had considered revealing an alleged 2006 intimate encounter with the married Trump, which he continues to deny occurred.Trump maintained his innocence, with his legal team asserting the Cohen payments were correctly classified as legal expenses.""For this I got indicted,"" Trump stated during sentencing. ""It's incredible, actually.""His defence team contended that Trump's motivation for suppressing such claims was family protection rather than campaign interests, maintaining the allegations were false.Presidential pardons being limited to federal offences, Trump cannot pardon himself in this state court matter.","US President Donald Trump has filed an appeal to challenge his hush money conviction to nullify the judgement that made him the first convicted individual to secure the presidency.

Vogue slammed, social media users share writer Hannah Jackson's photo asking if she can criticize anyone's fashion choice

Vogue published an article that criticized First Lady Melania Trump 's outfit and appearance in her official White House portrait, released a few days ago. Writer Hannah Jackson said Melania does not look like a public servant but in her tuxedo, she looks like a freelance magician. According to Jackson, Melania should have worn a blazer or blouse in the official photo -- but she said it was better than her 2017 photo.“Trump looked more like she was guest starring on an episode of ‘The Apprentice’ than assuming the role of first lady of the United States,” she wrote, referring to the black Dolce & Gabbana tuxedo jacket, white button-up and Ralph Lauren cummerbund Melania wore for the photo taken by Belgian photographer Régine Mahaux.“The choice to wear a tuxedo — as opposed to a blazer or blouse — made Trump look more like a freelance magician than a public servant.”The writer said Melania perhaps refused to ""abandon theatrics"" for the portrait since she lived in a ""gold-encrusted penthouse"" and her fame is ""so intertwined with a reality-television empire"".“This time, while the portrait remains more subdued, the Trumps are displaying wealth not through diamond rings but through the coterie of tech CEOs who sat in the front row at the 2025 inauguration, whose combined net worth was over a trillion dollars.”The black and white photo of Melania drew flak as many social media users called it ""heavily photoshopped"" but Vogue's harsh criticism of Melania has a context. Vogue did not make a cover on Melania during her first stint as the First Lady ditching a long-running tradition which they again reversed for Jill Biden as Jill was featured on Vogue cover months before the election.Melania Trump had earlier reacted to Vogue's snub to her not featuring her on the cover. “They’re biased and they have likes and dislikes, and it’s so obvious,” she had said. “And I think American people and everyone sees it. It was their decision, and I have much more important things to do—and I did in the White House—than being on the cover of Vogue.”On Vogue's X post, users called the magazine petty. ""She’s stunning and rarely misses when it comes to fashion…your opinions are trash and based purely on politics. Pathetic,"" one wrote. One shared the photo of writer Hannah Jackson and asked whether she should be giving out fashion advice to anyone.

Secret recordings reveal that RFK Jr cheated 'because he was being abused at home',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/secret-recordings-reveals-that-rfk-jr-cheated-because-he-was-being-abused-at-home/articleshow/117699073.cms,"New York Post

Robert F Kennedy Jr reportedly told his wife Mary Richardson Kennedy that it was her own fault he’d cheated on her with dozens of women, according to an American magazine citing secret recordings he made of their conversations during their bitter divorce.“I want to be in a monogamous relationship. I don’t want to be in a polygamous relationship. I think that’s wrong,” he told her in a June 2011 recording accessed by Mother Jones magazine.“But then why have you done it for 10 years?” asked Richardson, who had found a diary listing 37 of her husband’s infidelities.“I did it because I was being abused at home,” Kennedy replied.It was just one of more than 60 conversations that President Donald Trump’s nominee for secretary of health and human services secretly recorded, according to Mother Jones. At least one recording appeared to have been made when Kennedy was in California, a state that requires both parties to consent to a recording, the site reported.He apparently used the recordings to compile a 60-page affidavit accusing Richardson of violent outbursts, excessive drinking, physical abuse, and threatening suicide in front of their children.Richardson in turn prepared a previously unreported point-by-point rebuttal, saying Kennedy “has been stealthily tape-recording phone conversations in my home,” according to Mother Jones. She died by suicide in May 2012, without ever filing the rebuttal in court.In the document, Richardson admitted she had once lost her temper and hit Kennedy, but she denied many of his allegations—including that she had ever talked about killing herself in front of their kids. Her husband was waging a “scorched earth” campaign against her, she said.She also alleged Kennedy had physically abused her, was abusing prescription medicine, had lied to her about the extent of his infidelity, and was a bad father. She also called him a “sexual deviant” and a sex addict, and said she had texts and photos from his phone related to his affairs.“I have witnessed Bobby’s obsessive-compulsive need to not only beat but annihilate someone he perceives as an adversary. He re-jiggers the facts, or makes them up, and rushes to tell as many people as he can so that is the version of reality that gets distributed in people’s minds—classic gaslighting,” she wrote.In September 2013, Kennedy’s 2001 “sex diary” was leaked to the. In the back of a nearly 400-page red notebook, he listed 37 women and, using a scale of 1 to 10, noted which sex acts they’d done.Sixteen of the women were marked as 10s; on one day he recorded a “triple play” with three separate encounters listed as 10, 3 and 2.The diary highlights Kennedy’s struggles with his “lust demons,” and on days he’d managed to resist a sexual temptation, he wrote, “Victory.”“Despite the terrible things happening in the world, my life is… great. So I’ve been looking for ways to screw it up. I’m like Adam and live in Eden, and I can have everything but the fruit. But the fruit is all I want,” he wrote in November 2001. In an earlier entry he wrote, “It’s not ­misogyny. It’s the opposite! I love them too much.”","Robert F Kennedy Jr. secretly recorded his wife, Mary Richardson Kennedy, according to Mother Jones magazine.

Marri brought attention to the Pakiststate's systematic exploitation, enforced disappearances, and violence against various ethnic communities.""The sufferings of the Baloch and Pashtun under Pakistan's occupation are countless and unending,"" Marri stated, emphasizing the urgent need for unity between the two nations to resist colonial oppression.He recalled previous instances of solidarity, such as the treaty of kalat in 1758, in which Afghan and Baloch leaders promised to respect and support one another. He asked both groups to rekindle this spirit in their struggle for independence.Marri compared British imperialism to the colonial strategies that Pakistan acquired. He denounced Pakistan's continuous military actions in Balochistan , pointing to unlawful executions, torture, and enforced disappearances as means of quelling dissent. The Baloch leader cited the targeted profiling of Pashtuns and killings like the 1948 Barbra event in Charsadda, claiming that these practices were continuations of the British heritage of divide and conquer.Recalling how Pashtun tribes were utilized as frontline combatants in 1948 while Punjabi elites remained behind, he also denounced Pakistan's abuse of Baloch and Pashtun youth. He also drew attention to the fact that thousands of Baloch youths were forcibly drafted into the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s and sent to die under pretences of religious salvation.Marri condemned Pakistan's racial profiling of Afghan refugees, primarily Pashtuns, and their forced deportation as a pressure tactic against Afghanistan. ""These people have lived here for generations, yet they are treated as disposable,"" he said.Calling for a renewed alliance between the Baloch and Pashtun nations, Marri declared, ""Our unity is the path to freedom.

He sentenced the four men to death and also fined them 4.6 million Pakistani rupees (approximately $16,000). They were identified as Rana Usman, Ashfaque Ali, Salman Sajjad, and Wajid Ali.According to the court order, dated Jan 24, the four individuals were sentenced to death by hanging for using derogatory remarks against the Holy Prophet. They were also sentenced to life in prison for defiling the Holy Quran and to 10 years’ imprisonment for deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs. “All the sentences shall run concurrently,” the order read.The prosecution lawyer said the case was supported by forensic evidence from the devices used. The men’s lawyer, Manzoor Rahmani, criticised the court’s order, saying doubts and uncertainties that arise in such cases are ignored by the courts, likely due to fear of a religious backlash and potential mob violence against the judge if the accused is acquitted.“We are preparing our appeals against the decision and will go to the high court,” Rahmani said. A member of a support group formed by the families of the accused was quoted by media as saying the pattern of arrests and prosecutions in this case was consistent with previous ones.“We urge the government to establish a commission to investigate the rise in these cases before these young individuals spend the best years of their lives behind bars,” said the support group member.Critics say blasphemy accusations, whether true or false, often lead to lengthy prison sentences on death row and solitary confinement. The laws, according to them, are often abused to settle scores or used to target members of Pakistan’s religious minorities.Hundreds of people have been accused of blasphemy since the draconian laws were introduced by former dictator Gen Zia-ul-Haq in the 1980s. Nearly 100 people have been reportedly lynched to death so far while dozens remain on death row.",A Pakistani court has sentenced four men to death on blasphemy charges.

A Pakistani court on Monday awarded death penalty to four men for ""online blasphemy"" against the Prophet Mohammed and the Islamic holy book Quran.The four were charged with spreading blasphemous content online against Prophet Mohammed and the Islamic holy book.""They were sentenced to death... on Friday for spreading blasphemous content online against the Prophet Mohammed and the Quran,"" Rao Abdur Raheem, a lawyer from the legal commission on blasphemy Pakistan, a private group which brought the case to court, told news agency AFP.""Our case was supported by forensic evidence from the devices used in this heinous act,"" he added.The four men were sentenced in Rawalpindi, the garrison city that neighbours the capital Islamabad.A member of a support group formed by the families, however, said to AFP that they would challenge the conviction.""The pattern of arrests and prosecutions in this case is consistent with previous ones,"" said the support group member, who spoke on condition of anonymity told the news agency.""We urge the government to establish a commission to investigate the rise in these cases before these young individuals spend the best years of their lives behind bars,"" the member added.Blasphemy laws in Pakistan are among the strictest in the world, carrying severe punishments, including the death penalty, for offences against Islam.These laws, primarily enshrined in Sections 295-298 of the Pakistan Penal Code, criminalise acts such as insulting the Prophet Muhammad, desecrating the Quran, or offending religious sentiments.These laws have often been criticised for being misused to target minorities, settle personal disputes, and incite mob violence. The lack of safeguards against false accusations has led to numerous cases where individuals face imprisonment, violence, or even extrajudicial killings without substantial evidence.The blasphemy laws have sparked national and international debates about human rights and freedom of expression in Pakistan.Activists argue that these laws suppress religious minorities, limit free speech, and create a climate of fear, while conservative groups strongly defend them as essential to protecting Islam.High-profile cases, such as those of Asia Bibi and Salman Taseer, have highlighted the deep divisions in Pakistani society regarding these laws. Successive governments have been reluctant to amend or repeal the legislation due to the risk of backlash from religious hardliners. As a result, blasphemy remains a highly sensitive issue, with calls for legal reforms often met with strong resistance.","Pakistani court awards death penalty to four men for ""online blasphemy"" against the Prophet Mohammed and the Islamic holy book Quran.

Six of the petitioners appeared in court on Friday after the case was set for hearing.They claimed that it was the responsibility of the respondents to protect and provide a safe environment for all foreign citizens legally staying and investing in the country, including the petitioners.The petitioners said the Sindh police had engaged in repeated acts of harassment over the last six to seven months, including unwarrantedly restricting movement of Chinese nationals in Karachi and Sindh and unjustified detentions within their residences on the pretext of “security issues” without any clear legal grounds or specific incidents to justify such actions.They also claimed that the policemen stationed at their homes literally locked them in and restricted their movement within the confines of their houses, and that when the petitioners bowed to their illegal demands of paying Pakistani Rs 30,000 ($110) to Rs 50,000 ($182), they were let go.The petitioners also stated that officers from Sukhan police station (in Sindh) had recently sealed seven industrial units of other Chinese nationals without prior notice, citing security reasons.They added that their problems began when they arrived at the airport where officials refused to let them enter the country unless they were bribed, despite having all legally required papers.They also accused police of allegedly throwing stones at their vehicles and smashing the rear screens of their cars, and that the deployed policemen appeared indecent and unprofessionally trained. They cited complaints against them for disturbing privacy and demanding tips ranging from Pakistani Rs 15,000 ($55) to Rs 50,000 ($182).The petition also referenced an incident in which three Chinese female investors were forced to return to China after being treated disrespectfully at a Karachi expo centre.

LAHORE: A Pakistani court has awarded a death sentence and 80-year imprisonment to four persons for uploading blasphemous content on Facebook , an official said on Saturday. Additional Sessions Judge Mohammad Tariq Ayub on Friday convicted four suspects -- Wajid Ali, Ahfaq Ali Saqib, Rana Usman and Suleman Sajid -- for insulting Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), his companions, and his wives.The court official said the convicts uploaded blasphemous content on Facebook from four different IDs.""The judge after hearing arguments of both prosecution and defence and witnesses accounts awarded the death penalty and 80 years imprisonment to each of them on different counts,"" the official said.They were also slapped with a fine of PKR 5.2 million.Pakistan's Federal Investigation (FIA) Cybercrime registered a case under Section 11 of the PECA (Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act) and 295A, 295B, 295C, 298A, 109 and 34 of the Pakistan Penal Code on the complaint of Shiraz Farooqi, a citizen.According to Amnesty International , Pakistan's blasphemy laws are often used against religious minorities and others who are the target of false accusations, while emboldening vigilantes prepared to threaten or kill the accused.""There is overwhelming evidence that Pakistan's blasphemy laws violate human rights and encourage people to take the law into their own hands. Once a person is accused, they become ensnared in a system that offers them few protections, presumes them guilty, and fails to safeguard them against people willing to use violence,"" it said.Amnesty International added that in perversion of the justice system, the accused are often presumed to be guilty based on little or no evidence.""Once an accusation of blasphemy is made, the police can arrest the accused, without even checking to see if the charges make sense. Bowing to public pressure from angry crowds, including religious clerics and their supporters, they frequently pass cases on to prosecutors without scrutinising the evidence. And once someone is charged, they can be denied bail and face lengthy and unfair trials,"" it said.",A Pakistani court has awarded a death sentence and 80-year imprisonment to four persons for uploading blasphemous content on Facebook.

Hasina, 76, fled to India, and an interim government led by Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus was formed.Despite the change in government, a lawyer in Dhaka explained, ""If someone elected after a country's nomination to a United Nations body, he or she remains in position in his or her individual capacity, despite the country's government falls.""The political turmoil in Bangladesh has also spilled over to international politics. Recently, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer faced another setback with the resignation of anti-corruption minister Tulip Siddiq . Siddiq, 42, the niece of Sheikh Hasina, was implicated in an embezzlement investigation tied to Bangladesh.Siddiq clarified her position on X, stating, ""An independent review has confirmed that I have not breached the Ministerial Code and there is no evidence to suggest I have acted improperly. Nonetheless, to avoid distraction for the Government, I have resigned as City Minister."" She also explained that her family connections were disclosed, and she recused herself from matters related to Bangladesh to avoid any perception of conflict of interest.Hasina, who fled Bangladesh last year, has been living in India since August 5. The fallout from these events has significantly affected the political landscape in Bangladesh and has drawn international attention. Despite the investigations and political instability, Wazed remains in her position at WHO, as the case continues.","Saima Wazed is a psychologist by training and has worked extensively on neurodevelopmental disorders. She was confirmed as the WHO Regional Director on January 23, 2024, by the WHO Executive Board in Geneva. Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) of Bangladesh is investigating her for alleged corruption charges.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117593003,imgsize-610144,width-400,resizemode-4/117593003.jpg"

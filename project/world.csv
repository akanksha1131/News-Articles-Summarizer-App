Trump’s immigration policy shift? What US President said on farm labors; watch video,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-immigration-shift-theyve-turned-out-to-be-great-says-us-president-on-farm-workers-watch-video/articleshow/121814358.cms,"Donald Trump (PTI photo)





Despite his typically hardline stance on immigration, US President Donald Trump on Thursday signalled a potential shift—suggesting some undocumented immigrants may be allowed to remain in the US to prevent labour shortages in critical sectors like agriculture and hospitality.Speaking at a White House event, Trump said an executive order is being considered to allow certain undocumented immigrants to stay in the country, especially those working for American farmers.""Our farmers are being hurt badly. They have very good workers,"" Trump said.""They've worked for them for 20 years. They're not citizens, but they've turned out to be great. We're going to have to do something about that,"" he added.Trump indicated the possible executive action would also impact the hotel sector: ""We can't take farmers and take all their people and send them back because they don't have maybe what they're supposed to have.""""We're going to have an order on that pretty soon. We can't do that to our farmers,"" US President said.He did not specify what the order would contain or when it might be issued.Farm industry leaders have long urged the administration to shield agriculture from mass deportations, warning that such policies could severely disrupt the nation’s food supply chain, which relies heavily on immigrant labour.According to the US Departments of Labour and Agriculture, nearly half of America’s estimated 2 million farm workers—and many in the dairy and meatpacking industries—lack legal status.""Our great Farmers and people in the Hotel and Leisure business have been stating that our very aggressive policy on immigration is taking very good, long time workers away from them, with those jobs being almost impossible to replace,"" Trump wrote on his social media platform. ""Changes are coming!""The US president’s remarks come amid nationwide protests against immigration raids.Demonstrators have criticised the targeting of undocumented immigrants without criminal records, especially those detained at their workplaces. Protests intensified last week following enforcement actions in Los Angeles.On Thursday, Trump acknowledged the broader economic consequences of strict immigration enforcement, including within the hotel industry—an area connected to his own business interests.","US President Donald Trump suggests some undocumented immigrants may be allowed to remain in the US.

"500,000 immigrants affected: Trump admin revokes humanitarian parole for these 4 nations; tells them to leave US",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/500000-immigrants-affected-trump-admin-revokes-humanitarian-parole-for-these-4-nations-tells-them-to-leave-us/articleshow/121812169.cms,"



The Trump administration has begun notifying hundreds of thousands of immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela that their temporary permission to live and work in the United States has been revoked, and they must leave the country immediately, according to a statement by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on Thursday.The notices are being sent via email to individuals who entered the country under a humanitarian parole program initiated by the Biden administration in October 2022. Approximately 532,000 people from the four nations had been granted two-year permits under the program, which allowed them to live and work in the US with financial sponsorship.DHS confirmed that the letters state their work authorization and legal status are now “effective immediately” terminated. The agency encouraged those affected to leave voluntarily through a mobile application called CBP Home, promising a travel stipend and a $1,000 payment upon return to their home country. However, the department offered no details on how it would track departures or distribute payments.The decision follows the US Supreme Court’s ruling last month that allowed the Trump administration to dismantle the program, which the former president had vowed to eliminate, calling it an example of “broad abuse” of the humanitarian parole system.“This is a deeply destabilizing decision,” said Krish O'Mara Vignarajah, president of Global Refugee. “These are people that played by the rules... they passed security screenings, paid for their own travel, obtained work authorization, and began rebuilding their lives.”Zamora, a 34-year-old Cuban mother who came to the US in 2023 under the program, said she’s afraid of being detained while her child is at school. “I’m afraid to return to Cuba, the situation is very difficult there,” she said. Zamora is seeking permanent residency through the Cuban Adjustment Act but has not yet received approval. “I’m going to wait quietly without getting into trouble,” she added.","Hundreds of thousands of immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela must leave the country immediately.

California Democratic Senator Dragged Out Of Kristi Noem Presser Over LA ICE Clashes | Watch





In a chaotic scene on Thursday, Democratic US Senator Alex Padilla was forcibly removed, pushed to the ground and handcuffed during Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem ’s news conference in Los Angeles.The incident was captured on video and has sparked national outrage and renewed criticism of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.The California representative interrupted Noem’s event to raise questions about recent immigration raids that have triggered protests across the state and the country. Tensions flared after Noem said that federal forces were not retreating but instead planned to intensify operations to ""liberate"" the city from its ""socialist"" leadership.“I’m Sen. Alex Padilla. I have questions for the secretary,” Padilla shouted as a Secret Service agent grabbed him by the jacket and shoved him out of the room. A scuffle ensued in the hallway, where he was seen on his knees before being pushed to the floor and restrained by several officers.“Hands off!” he yelled during the altercation.The Department of Homeland Security later defended the actions of officers, claiming Padilla “chose disrespectful political theatre” and did not identify himself.However, the video clearly shows him stating his name and position. DHS also said that Padilla “was told repeatedly to back away and did not comply,” adding that officers “acted appropriately.”Padilla explained he was seeking answers about “increasingly extreme immigration enforcement actions” after receiving no response to prior inquiries. “If this is how this administration responds to a senator with a question… I can only imagine what they are doing to farmworkers, to cooks, to day labourers,” he said.Such treatment of a sitting senator drew immediate condemnation from fellow Democrats. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called it “despicable” and said, “We need immediate answers to what the hell went on.” Kamala Harris described the event as “a shameful and stunning abuse of power.”Meanwhile, Noem later told Fox LA she had a “great” conversation with Padilla but criticised his behaviour as inappropriate. The White House accused the senator of “grandstanding.”Republicans defended Noem, with House Speaker Mike Johnson accusing Padilla of “charging” at her and suggesting the act was worthy of censure. Meanwhile, Democrats in Congress are now demanding an investigation into the incident.","California Democratic Senator Dragged Out Of Kristi Noem Presser Over LA ICE Clashes.

US President Donald Trump took a reflective turn on Thursday, steering a conversation back in time to the days of World War II.In remarks that blended history with surprise, Trump recounted recent conversations with French President Emmanuel Macron and Russian President Vladimir Putin—both of which circled back to one of history’s greatest conflicts.""Macron is a good man,"" Trump began, before describing how the French leader told him, “We are celebrating World War II and our victory.” Trump said he responded with a smirk: ""Your victory?""—a remark that seemed to play down France’s role in the Allied win, despite being one of the key members of the coalition.He then shifted to Russia. Recalling a conversation with Putin, Trump said the Russian president emphasised the Soviet Union’s immense sacrifice in the war.""Russia fought with us in WWII and everybody hates them,"" Trump quoted Putin as saying, mentioning that the USSR lost around 51 million people during the conflict. ""And Germany and Japan, they're fine — someday somebody will explain that,"" Trump continued. ""But I like Germany and Japan too. Everybody hates Russia and they love Germany and Japan… It’s a strange world.""Trump went on to express confusion and disappointment over what he sees as America’s lack of commemoration for its role in the war. ""We won World War II and World War I, right? We won them. And yet, we are the only country that doesn’t celebrate. Everybody’s celebrating and we should celebrate too,"" he said.During World War II, the United States was a major force within the Allied powers, which included the UK, the Soviet Union (successor - modern day Russia), and France.

Meghalaya Murder: ‘Kamakhya visit before consummation of marriage’: Cops say Sonam used temple ruse to lure husband Raja Raghuvanshi to northeast,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/kamakhya-visit-before-consummation-of-marriage-cops-say-sonam-used-temple-ruse-to-lure-husband-raja-raghuvanshi-to-northeast/articleshow/121793341.cms,"Raja Raghuvanshi from Indore was killed during his honeymoon in Meghalaya. His wife, Sonam, allegedly planned the murder with her boyfriend, Raj Kushwaha. They hired three contract killers.

Poll Should the media play a role in raising awareness about such crimes? Yes, it's crucial No, it could lead to panic

NEW DELHI: Raja Raghuvanshi, the Indore-based businessman murdered during his honeymoon in Meghalaya, had been convinced by his wife Sonam to delay consummating the marriage until after a ritual offering at the Kamakhya Temple in Guwahati — a ruse investigators now say was part of a sinister plot to lure him to the Northeast and have him killed in a remote location.“Sonam told Raja that they should first visit the Kamakhya Devi Temple and offer prayers before consummating the marriage,” a senior investigating officer told PTI on Wednesday.The couple got married in Indore on May 11 and travelled to the Northeast on May 20, reaching Meghalaya via Guwahati. They checked out of a homestay in Nongriat village on May 23 and then disappeared — prompting Raja’s family to raise an alert. Ten days later, on June 2, Raja’s body was found in a gorge near Weisawdong Falls in Sohra.The case has since unravelled as a premeditated murder allegedly orchestrated by Sonam in connivance with her boyfriend Raj Kushwaha and three hired contract killers. Sonam, who initially went missing after the murder, resurfaced in Ghazipur, Uttar Pradesh, and surrendered on June 9. Her boyfriend and the three hitmen — Vishal Singh Chauhan, Akash Rajput, and Anand Kurmi — were arrested soon after.According to investigators, Sonam pushed for the trip to Nongriat — a remote jungle area accessible only by trekking — hoping the murder would be easier to execute there. But the plan was delayed due to heavy tourist presence on May 22 and 23.“They ultimately killed Raja near Weisawdong Falls and dumped his body into a gorge,” said the officer.East Khasi Hills SP Vivek Syiem, who is leading the investigation, said the contract killers arrived in Guwahati on May 21, a day after the couple reached the Northeast. They bought a machete near their hotel before heading to Shillong by road.“Sonam stayed in touch with Raj throughout the day of the murder, while Raj coordinated with the three killers. She was present at the spot when Raja was killed,” said SP Syiem.After the murder, Sonam fled from Mawkdok to Shillong in a local taxi, then hired a tourist cab to Guwahati, from where she boarded multiple trains to avoid detection.“While she claims to have returned to Indore directly, we are still verifying this route,” the officer added.The Meghalaya Police SIT is now piecing together the full timeline of events and has already gathered CCTV evidence and mobile data to support the investigation.“We are also verifying Sonam’s claim that she had never been to Meghalaya before. The SIT is committed to filing a watertight chargesheet,” an officer said.All five accused — Sonam, Raj Kushwaha, and the three contract killers — have been produced before a court in Shillong and remain in police custody.","Raja Raghuvanshi from Indore was killed during his honeymoon in Meghalaya.

5 vegetables approved by a gastroenterologist for liver health,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/5-vegetables-approved-by-a-gastroenterologist-for-liver-health/articleshow/121817336.cms,"Dr. Joseph Salhab recommends incorporating specific vegetables into your diet to promote liver health. Scientific studies suggest that beetroot, broccoli, onion, spinach, and cabbage can improve liver function and reduce the risk of conditions like NAFLD and liver cancer.

Liver health is crucial for overall well-being, as it performs over 500 essential functions, including detoxification, nutrient processing, and bile production for digestion. And yet, liver diseases are on the rise, affecting millions of people across the globe. Diet plays an important role in keeping the liver healthy. Dr. Joseph Salhab, a Florida-based gastroenterologist known as The Stomach Doc on Instagram, has now shared a list of vegetables that are good for the liver. Backed by scientific studies, these vegetables can improve liver function and may help reduce the risk of liver-related conditions, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and liver cancer. “I recommend these vegetables to all my liver patients. I make a habit of trying to eat these vegetables throughout the week,” he said in a video . Let’s take a look at the vegetables that offer a protective effect on the liver.Beetroot is a powerhouse for liver health. It has protective effects that lower liver enzymes. A 2023 meta-analysis found that beetroot juice supplementation significantly lowered liver enzymes alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), key markers of liver stress, in patients with NAFLD. Beetroot also improved hepatic steatosis, a condition characterized by excess fat in the liver.Incorporating beets in the diet can keep the liver sound and healthy.The gastroenterologist has stressed the importance of adding cruciferous vegetables to the diet. Broccoli, which is a cruciferous vegetable, has shown promising results in improving liver function. A 2015 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial found that broccoli sprout extract significantly reduced ALT and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GTP) levels in men with fatty liver disease. This leads to improved liver function. Broccoli’s ability to enhance detox enzyme activity makes it a staple in the diet of liver patients.Onions are rich in the antioxidant quercetin, which offers liver-protective benefits. The antioxidant properties help combat oxidative stress, a key factor in liver damage. A 2020 meta-analysis found that quercetin supplementation significantly reduced ALT levels in NAFLD patients. Onions are often an easy addition to many dishes. Along with the flavour, they also support liver health.Leafy greens are good for the liver. Spinach is linked to a reduced risk of liver cancer. According to a 2019 meta-analysis higher consumption of leafy greens, such as spinach was associated with a 39% lower risk of developing liver cancer. One can add spinach into salads, smoothies, or cooked dishes to get its protective effects against liver disease.Cruciferous vegetables are linked to lowering the risk of several types of cancers. Cabbage, on the other hand, also provides protective effects on the liver. This vegetable supports the liver’s natural detoxification processes. A 2007 human intervention study found that consuming Brassica vegetables like cabbage increased the activity of phase II detoxification enzymes in the liver.","Scientific studies suggest that beetroot, broccoli, onion, spinach, and cabbage can improve liver function and reduce the risk of conditions like NAFLD and liver cancer.

Australia captain Pat Cummins reached the milestone of 300 Test wickets while leading his team to a commanding position in the World Test Championship final against South Africa at Lord's on June 13, 2025. After two days of play, Australia reached 144-8 in their second innings, establishing a lead of 218 runs with two wickets remaining.A total of 28 wickets fell across the first two days as both teams' batsmen struggled for runs on a challenging pitch.Cummins delivered an outstanding bowling performance, taking 6-28 on the second day to help dismiss South Africa for 138 runs, giving Australia a first-innings lead of 74 runs.An eighth-wicket partnership of 61 between Alex Carey (43) and Mitchell Starc (16 not out) strengthened Australia's position at stumps.""It's set up pretty well. The mood in the changing room is pretty positive. It was a great partnership and a good way to end the day,"" Cummins said.""After two days it's pretty close to 50-50. It's a pretty good Test match. Some blokes have got themselves in and looked comfortable out there, but a lot of other guys haven't,"" Cummins added regarding the bowlers' dominance.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? Cummins attributed the rapid progress of the match to both pitch conditions and bowling quality.""Both teams have bowled really well, really disciplined. There haven't been many half-volleys,"" he said.""The trend of the game is that the runs are coming down. It's still pretty difficult out there, but we will have to bowl well tomorrow (Friday),"" the 32-year-old said in his 68th Test appearance.Cummins became the eighth Australian bowler to reach 300 Test wickets, achieving this feat at an average of 22.08.""There's not too many on that list.

It's a pretty good sign of durability and longevity,"" Cummins remarked about his milestone.South Africa's top scorer David Bedingham , who made 45 runs, acknowledged the challenging conditions.""It's a fairly tricky pitch, but I think when you have six quality seamers on a tricky pitch it obviously makes batting tough,"" Bedingham said.Despite trailing in the match, Bedingham expressed confidence in South Africa's ability to chase down the target.""It is an amazing chance and we are very excited about the opportunity to win. It could go either way but there is a lot of belief,"" he said.""I think the pitch is slowing down a bit and maybe in the fourth innings it will go a bit straighter.

The Boeing 787-8, carrying 242 passengers and crew, failed to gain altitude, impacting near the airport.

Flight AI-171 seen moments after lifting off from Ahmedabad airport, flying unusually low with its landing gear still deployed — the aircraft appears to struggle for altitude just 425 feet above the ground before vanishing behind buildings near Meghaninagar.

A massive explosion engulfs the BJ Medical College hostel building as the Dreamliner crashes into the doctors’ mess, triggering a fireball and dense black smoke that rose above the Meghaninagar skyline. Eyewitnesses described the sound as “like a bomb going off”.

The mangled remains of Air India’s 787-8 Dreamliner sprawled across the residential block and mess hall — its tail section wedged into the rooftop and debris scattered across half a kilometre. The scale of destruction left little hope for survivors.

NEW DELHI: In just 34 seconds, a routine takeoff turned into India’s deadliest single-aircraft crash. And in those same 34 seconds, three images, now etched into the nation’s memory, captured the full descent into horror.The first photo shows Air India’s London-bound Dreamliner moments after it lifts off from Runway 23 of Ahmedabad airport at 1.39pm. The aircraft, an 11-year-old Boeing 787-8, appears unusually low, barely clearing the airport perimeter. Its landing gear is still down. It isn’t climbing — it’s gliding flat, almost hesitantly, as if fighting an invisible drag. Flaps aren’t visibly engaged. For a wide-body aircraft carrying over 240 people, the trajectory looks disturbingly unnatural.The second frame freezes the exact moment of impact. The aircraft, having lost altitude rapidly, tears into the BJ Medical College hostel mess in Meghaninagar. The image captures a deafening blast — an orange-white fireball erupting from the ground, hurling metal, glass, and flame into the sky. Black smoke begins to rise instantly. Eyewitnesses said they heard the plane coming in too low.The third photo is aftermath.Nothing resembling an aircraft remains. The fuselage has splintered; debris strewn across the hostel quarters and adjacent lanes. A section of the empennage — the aircraft’s tail — hangs grotesquely from the roof of the mess building. The landing gear is embedded in a nearby wall. The crash site, just 3km from the end of the runway, looks like a war zone.AI-171, with 242 passengers and crew onboard, had taken off late — and didn’t get far. Captain Sumeet Sabharwal’s calm “Mayday” call to Ahmedabad ATC was the last transmission. After climbing to just 425 feet, the plane nosedived, leaving little time for response, and no chance for recovery.The crash killed at least 245 people, including former Gujarat CM Vijay Rupani and several doctors and residents on the college campus. One man, seated in 11A — a UK national of Indian origin — survived and walked out of the burning fuselage. The death toll is expected to rise, with nearly 290 body bags in use by rescue teams.Initial probes point to a double engine failure, possibly due to bird strike — though investigators have not ruled out technical or procedural lapses. This was the first crash involving a Boeing 787 Dreamliner since its launch. The aircraft had logged over 41,000 flight hours, with 8,000 takeoffs and landings in the past year alone.The Tata Group has announced ₹1 crore compensation for each victim’s family and has pledged support to rebuild the BJ Medical College hostel.As firefighters, NDRF teams, and hospital staff sifted through the charred remains, the three photos — frozen moments from a tragedy — told the full story in a way words never could.","Boeing 787-8, carrying 242 passengers and crew, failed to gain altitude, impacting near the airport.

Appeals court temporarily blocks judge's ruling to return control of National Guard to California,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/appeals-court-temporarily-blocks-judges-ruling-to-return-control-of-national-guard-to-california/articleshow/121817354.cms,"Appeals court temporarily blocks judge's ruling to return control of National Guard to California(AP Photos)





The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday temporarily blocked a federal judge's order that directed President Donald Trump to return control of National Guard troops to California after he deployed them there following protests in Los Angeles over immigration raids.The court said it would hold a hearing on the matter on June 17. The ruling came only hours after a federal judge's order was to take effect at noon Friday.Earlier Thursday, U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer ruled the Guard deployment was illegal and both violated the Tenth Amendment and exceeded Trump's statutory authority. The order applied only to the National Guard troops and not Marines who were also deployed to the LA protests. The judge said he would not rule on the Marines because they were not out on the streets yet.California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who had asked the judge for an emergency stop to troops helping carry out immigration raids, had praised the earlier ruling.""Today was really about a test of democracy, and today we passed the test,"" Newsom said in a news conference before the appeals court decision.The White House had called Breyer's order ""unprecedented"" and said it ""puts our brave federal officials in danger.""""The district court has no authority to usurp the President's authority as Commander in Chief,"" White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement. ""The President exercised his lawful authority to mobilize the National Guard to protect federal buildings and personnel in Gavin Newsom's lawless Los Angeles. The Trump Administration will immediately appeal this abuse of power and looks forward to ultimate victory on the issue. ""Newsom's case was solely focused on the National Guard, and the judge said when the state attorney asked about whether this could apply to the Marines that he would not rule on that because they were not on the streets yet.Marines in civil disturbance training at nearby base About 700 Marines have been undergoing civil disturbance training at Naval Weapons Station Seal Beach in Orange County, California. Nicholas Green, an attorney for the state, told the court: ""I have been told by the office of the governor that within the next 24 hours, 140 Marines will replace and relieve National Guard members in Los Angeles.""Typically the authority to call up the National Guard lies with governors, but there are limited circumstances under which the president can deploy those troops. Trump federalized members of the California National Guard under an authority known as Title 10.Title 10 allows the president to call the National Guard into federal service under certain limited circumstances, such as when the country ""is invaded,"" when ""there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government,"" or when the president is unable ""to execute the laws of the United States.""Breyer said in his ruling that what is happening in Los Angeles does not meet the definition of a rebellion.""The protests in Los Angeles fall far short of 'rebellion,'"" he wrote.It was not immediately clear how that would change the situation on the ground.California sued the federal government Newsom sued to block the Guard's deployment against his wishes. California later filed an emergency motion asking the judge to block the Guard from assisting with immigration raids.The governor argued that the troops were originally deployed to protect federal buildings and wanted the court to block the troops from helping protect immigration agents during the raids, saying that involving the Guard would only escalate tensions and promote civil unrest.Maj. Gen. Scott Sherman, commander of Task Force 51, which is overseeing the Guard troops and Marines sent to Los Angeles, said that as of Wednesday about 500 of the Guard troops had been trained to accompany agents on immigration operations. Photos of Guard soldiers providing security for the agents have already been circulated by immigration officials.None of the Marines have been trained to go on immigration raids, and it is not yet clear if they eventually will, Sherman said.Trump improperly called up the Guard, judge says In his broad ruling, the judge determined Trump had not properly called the Guard up in the first place.The lawsuit argued that Title 10 also requires that the president go through governors when issuing orders to the National Guard.Brett Shumate, an attorney for the federal government, said Trump complied with the statute by informing the general in charge of the troops of his decision and would have the authority to call in the Guard even if he had not.In a brief filed ahead of the Thursday hearing, the Justice Department said Trump's orders were not subject to judicial review.""Courts did not interfere when President Eisenhower deployed the military to protect school desegregation. Courts did not interfere when President Nixon deployed the military to deliver the mail in the midst of a postal strike. And courts should not interfere here either,"" the department said.""Our position is this is not subject to judicial review,"" Shumate told the judge.Breyer, who at one point waved a copy of the constitution, said he disagreed.""We're talking about the president exercising his authority, and the president is of course limited in that authority. That's the difference between a constitutional government and King George,"" he said.Protests intensified The protests over immigration raids in Los Angeles intensified after Trump called up the Guard and have since spread to other cities, including Boston, Chicago and Seattle.Trump has described Los Angeles in dire terms that Bass and Newsom say are nowhere close to the truth.","The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will hold a hearing on the matter on June 17. A federal judge's order to return control of the National Guard to California was to take effect Friday. Earlier, the judge ruled the Guard deployment was illegal and exceeded Trump's statutory authority. The White House called the order ""unprecedented""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121817428,imgsize-1220260,width-400,resizemode-4/121817428.jpg"

No chance of survival, says Amit Shah

Formal investigation launched

Airline response and compensation

Site of devastation

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the site of the Air India plane crash in Ahmedabad on Friday, a day after the deadly accident killed 241 people, including 12 crew members.He was accompanied by Gujarat Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel and senior Union ministers as he reviewed the situation on the ground.The crash, which occurred shortly after take-off on June 12, involved Air India Flight AI171, a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner en route from Ahmedabad to London Gatwick.Among the 241 people onboard were 169 Indian nationals, 53 British nationals, seven Portuguese citizens, and one Canadian national.According to the airline, one passenger miraculously survived the crash. The survivor, a British national of Indian origin, is currently undergoing treatment.The aircraft, piloted by Captain Sumeet Sabharwal — a Line Training Captain with over 8,200 hours of flying experience — took off from Ahmedabad’s Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport.Shortly after take-off from runway 23, the crew issued a Mayday call to Air Traffic Control (ATC).However, all communication was lost moments later, and the aircraft crashed just beyond the airport perimeter into the BJ Medical College campus in Meghaninagar — specifically into a residential building housing young doctors.An official said thick black smoke was seen billowing from the site minutes after impact. The crash sparked a massive fire, fuelled by an estimated 125,000 litres of aviation fuel on board.Union home minister Amit Shah, who was briefed by Gujarat chief minister Bhupendra Patel shortly after the incident, said there was virtually “no chance of saving anyone” due to the extreme temperatures caused by the burning fuel.Speaking to reporters, Shah said, “The moment we received the information, I alerted the Prime Minister, the Gujarat Home Minister, the Civil Aviation Ministry and all key agencies. The PM called back immediately, and a coordinated rescue effort began within minutes.”Shah also revealed that over 1,000 DNA samples had been collected to help identify victims. The official death toll will be released after these tests are completed.Union Civil Aviation Minister Ram Mohan Naidu confirmed that the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB), which operates under the Ministry of Civil Aviation, has launched a formal probe into the incident.The investigation will follow international guidelines laid out by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).Naidu also announced that a high-level committee of experts from multiple disciplines will be formed to examine the circumstances of the crash and suggest measures to enhance aviation safety in India.In a related development, the US-based National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is preparing to send a team of investigators to assist with the probe, as per international protocols involving aircraft built by American manufacturers.Tata Group, the owner of Air India, has announced a compensation of ₹1 crore (approximately £95,000) for the families of each deceased passenger.A dedicated helpline has also been set up for families and relatives of those on board. For callers within India, the number is 1800 5691 444. For those calling from abroad, the helpline number is +91 8062779200.Air India Managing Director and CEO Campbell Wilson also visited the crash site to assess the situation and support ongoing relief efforts.The crash left a trail of devastation in the BJ Medical College campus, where the aircraft’s nose struck a residential block for junior doctors, while the tail section hit the doctors' mess just after a large group had finished lunch.The fire and impact killed at least three resident doctors and the pregnant wife of another. A 13-year-old boy who worked at a tea stall nearby also died.One doctor described the scene as “apocalyptic”, with smoke, heat, and screams filling the air. Many of the doctors present at the site joined rescue efforts, pulling out bodies and tending to the injured despite the trauma unfolding around them.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the site of the Air India plane crash in Ahmedabad.

Visuals from Iran showed smoke billowing from multiple areas in Iran early on Friday as Israel launched an attack, with explosions resonating throughout Tehran. The strikes targeted nuclear and military installations.Tehran residents woke to explosions. State television acknowledged the incident. Smoke was visible near Chitgar, western Tehran. No known nuclear facilities exist there, with situation unclear elsewhere.While there is still uncertainty surrounding the extent of damage, Iran's primary nuclear enrichment facility was reportedly targetted at Natanz.The Natanz facility consists of both above-ground and underground sections, housing numerous centrifuge halls for uranium gas enrichment in its nuclear programme.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed Israel's responsibility for Friday's attack on the site.

Israel launched a ""preemptive strike"" on Iran, targeting Iranian nuclear and military sites. The Iranian state-run news agency acknowledged the explosions. Air-raid sirens preventatively rang out in Israel.The strikes occurred amid heightened tensions regarding Iran's nuclear programme. The International Atomic Energy Agency's Board of Governors issued its first censure against Iran in 20 years on Thursday. Iran responded by announcing plans for a third enrichment facility and upgrading its centrifuges.Also read: Operation 'Rising Lion': What nuclear facility did Israel strike in Iran?

Tasnim news agency, a local media outlet, stated: ""Major General Hossein Salami, head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, was martyred in the Israeli regime's attack on the IRGC headquarters.""The Revolutionary Guard maintains significant influence within Iran's theocratic structure and holds authority over the nation's ballistic missile capabilities, Times of Israel reported.Also read: Operation Rising Lion: Iran's key uranium enrichment facility hit 'several times' - what we know so far Israeli forces report that the initial strikes also resulted in the deaths of Mohammad Bagheri, Iran's military chief, along with several high-ranking military officials and prominent nuclear scientists.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated via YouTube that Israel conducted ""a targeted military operation roll back the Iranian threat to Israel's very survival,"" indicating operations would persist until the threat subsides. He added that the attacks will continue “for as many days at it takes to remove this threat.”Iran warned Israel after it launched ""Operation Rising Lion"" on Thursday, said they will face a “severe punishment.”Israel “opened its wicked and blood-stained hand to a crime in our beloved country, revealing its malicious nature more than ever by striking residential centers,” Khamenei says.“With this crime, the Zionist regime has set itself for a bitter and painful fate and it will definitely receive it,” Khamenei says.Defence minister Israel Katz issued warnings about potential missile and drone attacks, declaring an emergency situation requiring adherence to protective measures. “In the wake of the state of Israel’s preventive attack against Iran, missile and drone attacks against Israel and its civilian population are expected immediately,” he said in a statement.The statement added that Katz “signed a special order declaring an emergency situation in the home front.”“It is essential to listen to instructions from the home front command and authorities to stay in protected areas,” it saidSecretary Rubio confirmed Israel's independent action, stating the US received prior notification of strikes deemed necessary for Israeli self-defence. He cautioned Iran against targeting US interests.In a statement, he said: “Tonight, Israel took unilateral action against Iran. We are not involved in strikes against Iran and our top priority is protecting American forces in the region. Israel advised us that they believe this action was necessary for its self-defense. President Trump and the Administration have taken all necessary steps to protect our forces and remain in close contact with our regional partners. Let me be clear: Iran should not target US interests or personnel.”Also read: ‘We are not involved’: US distances itself from Israeli strikes on Tehran; warns Iran against retaliation US Senator Jack Reed, leading Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, criticised the Israeli strike as a dangerous action that could trigger regional conflict.""These strikes threaten not only the lives of innocent civilians but the stability of the entire Middle East and the safety of American citizens and forces,"" he said. Reed further stated: ""I urge both nations to show immediate restraint, and I call on President Trump and our international partners to press for diplomatic de-escalation before this crisis spirals further out of control.""Numerous commercial aircraft were traversing Iranian airspace during the strikes, as evidenced by flight tracking data.After the Israeli strike commenced, some aircraft continued their routes through Iranian airspace, whilst others swiftly adjusted their flight paths to exit the region.Several countries had previously restricted their aircraft from flying over Iran due to ongoing regional tensions.A senior Israeli military official, speaking anonymously, confirmed that Israel has conducted strikes on Iranian nuclear and military installations, though specific locations were not disclosed.During the operational briefing, the official outlined three primary concerns regarding Iran: They claim Iran is secretly developing nuclear weapons, despite US intelligence assessments indicating otherwise. Additionally, Iran's extensive ballistic missile arsenal and its distribution of weaponry to regional groups like Hezbollah and Hamas were cited as significant threats.During the Tehran explosions, Donald Trump was observed socialising with Congressional members on the White House lawn. He continued meeting and photographing with guests, though it was not clear whether he had been briefed about the situation.Earlier that day, Trump had commented that whilst an Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear facilities was not immediate, it remained a strong possibility.The US government had taken precautionary measures, including withdrawing diplomatic staff from Baghdad and offering evacuation options to US military families across the Middle East region.After the Israel attacked Iran, the oil prices surged over six percent on Friday. West Texas Intermediate (WTI), the main US oil contract, was trading 6.3 percent higher at $72.29 per barrel, while Brent North Sea crude was up 5.7 percent at $73.29.Also read: Operation Rising Lion: Iran's key uranium enrichment facility hit 'several times' - what we know so far","Israel launched a ""preemptive strike"" on Iran, targeting Iranian nuclear and military sites.

Israeli PM Netanyahu said in a video message: ""Moments ago, Israel launched Operation Rising Lion, a targeted military operation to roll back the Iranian threat to Israel's very survival.""

Israel’s defence minister described the assault as a series of ""preemptive strikes."" Codenamed as 'Rising Lion'.

Israel’s military chief of staff said the country is fully prepared along all its borders and issued a strong warning to its enemies. ""We are prepared across all borders. I warn that anyone who will try to challenge us will pay a heavy price,"" he said.

According to a statement from IDF spokesperson Brigadier General Effie Defrin, the Israeli military targeted Iranian military and nuclear sites in what is being described as a broad and coordinated offensive.

""This operation will continue as long as necessary, until we complete the mission,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement, adding that the strikes are aimed at Iran's nuclear program, ballistic missile capabilities, and broader military infrastructure.

In response to the attacks, Iran’s Tasnim news agency reported that flights were suspended at Tehran’s Imam Khomeini International Airport . While the airport itself has not been directly hit, air traffic has been halted as a precaution.

State TV reported that the Natanz enrichment facility ""has been hit several times,"" and broadcast footage showing thick smoke rising from the site.

Israel has for years warned it would take direct military action if Iran’s nuclear program crossed red lines.

International watchdogs say Iran continues to enrich uranium close to weapons-grade levels, raising alarm in Israel and among its allies.

The strikes come as the Trump administration has been engaged in diplomatic efforts to reach a new agreement with Iran to curb its nuclear activities. US envoy Steve Witkoff has held five rounds of talks with Iranian officials in recent months. However, there are no signs that the US participated in the Israeli operation.





Israel launched a military operation against Iran late Thursday, with explosions reported across Tehran, the Iranian capital.

New UAE Dirham symbol: All dos and don’ts you must know for correct use and official compliance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/new-uae-dirham-symbol-all-dos-and-donts-you-must-know-for-correct-use-and-official-compliance/articleshow/121776894.cms,"The new UAE dirham symbol blends national heritage with modern design, featuring a ""D"" with two lines for physical currency and a circular ring for its digital version / Image (X)

Where the Dirham Symbol Should Be Used

Physical currency : Printed on banknotes and coins.





: Printed on banknotes and coins. Cheques, invoices, and receipts : Displayed to represent amounts clearly.





: Displayed to represent amounts clearly. Point of Sale (POS) systems and Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) : For transaction displays.





: For transaction displays. Online and in-store price tags : Ensuring price visibility and uniformity.





: Ensuring price visibility and uniformity. Financial apps and accounting systems: Used within user interface (UI) fields for clarity.





Where the Symbol Should Not Be Used

It should not be used as a logo or branding element.





Avoid using it on splash screens or headers.





When writing amounts in words, always use “Dirhams” instead of the symbol.





How to Use the Dirham Symbol Correctly





Keyboard Placement:

Placement Rules





In single-language contexts, the symbol should be centered relative to the number.





In dual-language contexts, place the symbol in the top-left corner.





Maintain a minimum clear space of 2mm around the symbol to preserve visibility.





On Cheques

In the ‘amount in figures’ field: place the symbol before the numeric value, keeping the symbol the same size and weight as the numbers.





In the ‘amount in words’ field: spell out “Dirhams” rather than using the symbol.





On Receipts

Place the symbol before the numeric value.





Use the same font, size, and weight for consistency.





Text should be in English, right-aligned, with appropriate spacing.





On Price Tags

The symbol should appear directly before the numeric value.





Keep the font, size, and weight consistent.





Use either the symbol or “AED” (the currency code), not both.





Maintain clarity and legibility, especially in busy retail settings.





Dos and Don’ts for Using the Dirham Symbol

Dos:

Maintain the shape and direction of the symbol relative to the text.





Ensure proportional spacing and size in relation to numerals.





Use sufficient contrast so the symbol is easily readable.





Use either the symbol or “AED,” but not both together.





Always position the symbol to the left of the numerals.





Keep a clear space around the symbol to avoid crowding.





Respect the geometry and proportions of the symbol in all uses.





Don’ts:

Do not distort or alter the symbol in any way.





Avoid combining the symbol with “AED.”





Do not reduce contrast or add any decorative elements that could obscure the symbol.





Avoid incorrect positioning or sizing, such as placing the symbol after numerals or making it disproportionately large or small in a way that diminishes the clarity of the symbol.







As the Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE) moves forward with the digital transformation of the dirham, the guidelines for the new symbol are a crucial step toward harmonizing physical and digital currency usage. The Digital Dirham, expected to launch for retail use in late 2025, will be issued through licensed financial institutions like banks, exchange houses, and fintech companies. This digital version will utilize blockchain technology to enhance security, reduce transaction costs, and streamline cross-border payments, offering instant, secure settlements with smart contract capabilities for multi-party transactions. Integrated into a secure wallet and smart contract–enabled platform, the Digital Dirham will support retail, wholesale, and cross-border payments, providing a seamless and convenient user experience across various transactions.



This move is part of the UAE’s broader strategy to establish the dirham as a leading global currency, underpinned by the nation’s recent adherence to the FX Global Code. As the first central bank in the Arab region to join this code, the CBUAE is bolstering the dirham's credibility by committing to best practices in currency trading, reinforcing transparency, market integrity, and ethical standards. These developments signal a new chapter for the dirham, not only strengthening its role in the UAE's financial ecosystem but also positioning the currency to play a more influential role in the global digital payments space.





On March 27, 2025, the UAE unveiled a new symbol for its national currency, the dirham. A blend of national heritage and modern design, the symbol represents not just the UAE’s financial stability but also its vision to strengthen its role in the global economy. Unveiled by the Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE), the symbol features the English letter ""D"" flanked by two horizontal lines, inspired by the UAE flag, signifying the dirham's enduring strength. The design, rooted in classical Arabic calligraphy such as Thuluth and Diwani, reflects elegance and authority through its sweeping curves and pointed endings. The Digital Dirham symbol takes this a step further, incorporating a circular ring around the ""D"", symbolising security, continuity, and the UAE's forward-looking financial ecosystem. The use of the UAE flag’s colours in the digital design reinforces national pride, while the circular motif signifies a tokenised, blockchain-based currency, aiming to enhance global connectivity and transactional efficiency.As part of this launch, local authorities have provided clear guidelines on how the symbol should be used across various platforms to maintain consistency and clarity.The authorities emphasize consistent application of the symbol across both physical and digital platforms to maintain clarity and coherence in financial communications. Here’s where the symbol is intended to appear:The guidelines also specify clear restrictions to avoid misuse or dilution of the symbol’s meaning:The symbol is assigned to the number 6 key on keyboards for easy access.","The new UAE dirham symbol blends national heritage with modern design, featuring a ""D"" with two lines for physical currency and a circular ring for its digital version.

Jamaluddin arrived in Dubai by ship from Mumbai/ Image: X-Dubai Airports

From Humble Beginnings





Inspired by UAE’s Visionary Leadership



Passing the Torch to Future Generations







In a heartfelt tribute to a life dedicated to Dubai, 90-year-old Indian expatriate Haji N. Jamaluddin was recently presented with a special commemorative airport-entry stamp, 60 years after he first set foot in the emirate. The honour was granted by Dubai Airports, fulfilling a touching request from his son to mark a pivotal moment in their family’s shared history with the UAE.As reported by Gulf News, Jamaluddin arrived in Dubai from Mumbai on February 26, 1965, travelling by ship to a city still in its early days of development. What began as a journey of opportunity turned into a lifetime of service and deep community ties.“This new entry stamp isn't just a mark in a passport, it's a tribute to everything Dubai has given us,” said Jamaluddin, speaking to Gulf News. “My son wanted to honour the years I've spent here, and with the help of the Dubai Airports team, he made that possible.”Now a well-respected educator and community leader, Jamaluddin is the chairman and founder of Crescent English High School, an institution he established in 1984. The school has grown steadily under his leadership and today educates over 1,700 students, maintaining its reputation as one of the most affordable private schools in the UAE.Jamaluddin’s educational philosophy is rooted in values, not profit. He shared his guiding principle:“Money is not everything. Education is the best weapon for enlightenment.”F or four decades, he has nurtured generations of students, driven by a deep-seated commitment to social upliftment and access to quality learning. His leadership and efforts have left a lasting mark on Dubai’s educational ecosystem.Throughout his journey, Jamaluddin has drawn inspiration from the UAE’s leadership, particularly the late Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum, who he recalls seeing visiting construction sites in the early mornings. This connection, he believes, shaped both his values and his deep bond with Dubai.“He was always among the people and now His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai is continuing that legacy. It’s what makes Dubai what it is today,” he reflected.This personal insight into the UAE's visionary leadership underscores the emotional and symbolic significance of the commemorative gesture, a recognition of his enduring loyalty to the city.As part of the celebrations, students from Crescent English High School were invited for a special educational tour of Dubai International Airport (DXB). Organised by Dubai Airports, the tour offered students a rare glimpse behind the scenes, showcasing how DXB plays a pivotal role in global connectivity.The visit was more than just a field trip; it served as a tribute to their founder’s legacy and an educational opportunity to understand the infrastructure that supports Dubai’s status as a global hub.","Haji N.

A major update to media regulation in the UAE has officially come into force, requiring all social media influencers and content creators engaged in commercial activities to obtain a business license before applying for a media license from the UAE Media Council.This shift is part of the broader Media Regulation Law, implemented on May 29, 2025, by the UAE Media Council, marking a significant development in the country's evolving digital media landscape. The regulation is aimed at fostering ethical, high-quality online content, while safeguarding societal norms and ensuring public trust.Previously, influencers and creators were only required to obtain a media license. The new regulation now mandates a business license first, reflecting the UAE’s commitment to more structured oversight of online commercial activity.The policy is part of the UAE’s Digital Participation Policy, designed to promote constructive engagement on social media while ensuring compliance with local laws and values. It gives the Media Council broad authority to monitor, modify, or remove digital content that violates regulations.Speaking at a recent press conference in Dubai, Maitha Al Suwaidi, CEO of Strategy and Media Policies Sector at the UAE Media Council, emphasized the broader vision behind the law.“This road map reflects our deep understanding of the challenges and opportunities presented by new media. It is designed to foster a flexible, contemporary environment that aligns with global media trends while safeguarding the UAE’s core values,” she said.She also noted that the primary goals of the new licensing system are to build public trust, protect audiences, and elevate the quality of online content.In a supportive move aimed at easing the transition, the UAE Media Council has waived all permit fees for a period of three years for influencers and content creators applying under the new system.According to Maitha Al Suwaidi:“To support content creators, the Council is offering a three-year exemption from permit fees, providing a financial cushion for influencers to adapt to the new regulations.”This approach reflects an understanding of the financial and logistical challenges that many independent creators face, particularly those who are just beginning to commercialize their platforms.The updated Media Regulation Law also introduces stringent penalties for violations. Offenders may face fines of up to Dh1 million, with the severity of the penalty based on the frequency and gravity of the offense.The UAE Media Council retains full authority to delete or modify any content that contravenes the guidelines set forth in the new law, including posts that may be deemed defamatory, offensive, or otherwise disruptive to social harmony.Here’s a breakdown of what’s now required under the new law:The UAE’s updated media framework marks a defining moment in its approach to digital communication. It puts in place a modern and robust regulatory system that balances the freedom to create with responsibility and accountability, ultimately aiming to promote a safer, more credible, and culturally respectful digital environment.With the UAE emerging as a growing hub for digital talent, these regulatory developments are likely to shape influencer practices, guide content standards, and ensure that public engagement remains respectful and in line with national values."," Influencers earning from content in the UAE must get business licenses or risk fines up to Dh1 million.

Trump's 'CHANGE OF HEART' After Elon Regrets Attacks On U.S. Pres. | Biggest Drama Of 2025 Ends?





An Islamist terror group leader has released a disturbing video calling for the assassination of US President Donald Trump , Vice President JD Vance, and several top advisers. He said their strong support for Israel was the reason behind the threat, according to the New York Post.The Yemen-based figure is Sa'ad bin Atef al-Awlaki, who is the leader of al-Qa’ida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP).In a disturbing 34‑minute video titled 'Inciting the Believers', released on Sunday, the terror leader urged American Muslims to “take revenge” and strike at those he called “infidel Americans”. He named Trump, Vance, as well as figures like Secretary of State Marco Rubio , Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth and billionaire Elon Musk . “Go after them and their families and all those who have any ties or are close to the politicians of the White House,” al‑Awlaki said.He further said, “There are no red lines after what has been happening to our people in Gaza,” and endorsed recent antisemitic attacks and prior assassination attempts on Trump, according to security sources.The video also includes a broader incitement of violence against Jewish people in the US. “Do not leave a single safe place for Jews — just as they have not left any homes, shelters, or respite for the Palestinians,” al‑Awlaki said.“Even hospitals are being bombed … Take revenge.”Al‑Awlaki became head of AQAP in March 2024 and has a $6 million US bounty on his head offered by the State Department. AQAP is officially designated a foreign terrorist organisation by the US government. The Associated Press reported that al‑Awlaki’s video was his first since assuming leadership and also urged lone‑wolf attacks targeting leaders in Egypt, Jordan and Gulf states over the Gaza conflict.According to analysts, AQAP appears to be trying to regain prominence amid growing tensions in Gaza and rising influence of the Iran‑backed Houthi movement in Yemen.","The Yemen-based figure is Sa'ad bin Atef al-Awlaki, who is the leader of al- Qa’ida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) In a disturbing 34‑minute video titled 'Inciting the Believers', released on Sunday, the terror leader urged American Muslims to “take revenge” and strike at those he called “infidel Americans’","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121770314,width-400,resizemode-4/121770314.jpg"

A Shifting Landscape: New Additions and Deletions



Commitment to International Standards and Future Steps



UAE's Proactive Stance: A Glimpse at Recent Efforts







In a significant development for its global financial standing, the European Union on Tuesday announced the removal of the United Arab Emirates from its money-laundering ""high-risk"" list. This decision reflects growing international recognition of the UAE's intensified efforts to combat financial crimes. Alongside the UAE, seven other jurisdictions were also removed from the list: Barbados, Gibraltar, Jamaica, Panama, the Philippines, Senegal, and Uganda.While the UAE and others exited the high-risk list, the European Commission also revealed new additions. Monaco was included alongside nine other jurisdictions now subject to increased scrutiny of their money laundering controls. These newly added countries are Algeria, Angola, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Laos, Lebanon, Namibia, Nepal, and Venezuela.The EU's move aligns closely with the assessments of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a Paris-based international watchdog. The FATF reviews the efforts of over 200 countries and jurisdictions in preventing money laundering and terrorism financing, compiling a ""grey list"" for nations under increased monitoring. Notably, the FATF had already removed the Philippines from its list of countries facing increased monitoring in February, while adding Laos and Nepal.Monaco has been on the FATF list since mid-2024, a list which also includes EU member states Bulgaria and Croatia.Maria Luis Albuquerque, the EU's commissioner for financial services, underscored the importance of this update. She stated, ""The commission has now presented an update to the EU list which reiterates our strong commitment to aligning with international standards, particularly those set by the FATF.""The updated EU list is not yet final. It will now undergo scrutiny by the European Parliament and member states. If there are no objections, the revised list will officially enter into force within one month, as confirmed by the Commission.Monaco's government, upon taking note of this expected update, issued a statement acknowledging their anticipated placement on the EU list, unless the European Parliament or the Council of the EU decides otherwise. The principality also stressed its firm commitment to take all necessary steps to be removed from the FATF's grey list ""in the short term,"" indicating proactive measures to address international concerns.Also read: UAE Launches Major Money Laundering Crackdown, Collecting Dh339 Million in Fines The EU's decision to remove the UAE from its high-risk list comes amidst significant and widely publicized efforts by the Emirates to strengthen its anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing framework. In recent months, UAE regulators have launched an intense crackdown, levying over Dh339 million in fines against local exchange houses, foreign bank branches, and insurance companies. This aggressive stance includes imposing hefty penalties, pursuing systemic weaknesses in monitoring suspicious transactions, and expanding regulatory oversight to high-risk sectors such as real estate, gold and jewellery trading, auditing, and corporate service providers. Furthermore, the UAE Ministry of Economy has teamed up with Dubai Police to enhance surveillance and data sharing on beneficiary ownership details, reinforcing the nation's commitment to protecting its financial system from abuse.","The European Union on Tuesday announced the removal of the United Arab Emirates from its money-laundering ""high-risk"" list.

A String of Heavy Penalties and Enforcement Actions



Latest Actions: On Tuesday, the CBUAE imposed Dh12.3 million in fines on six exchange houses. These penalties followed inspections that uncovered multiple violations, specifically failures to comply with the country's anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CFT) framework. This move came just a week after the Central Bank had already issued a Dh3.5 million fine to another exchange house for similar shortcomings, with investigators citing significant lapses in the firm’s adherence to AML/CFT policies and procedures.





Earlier Major Fines: The intensity of the crackdown notably increased late last month. One exchange house was fined a staggering Dh100 million. Days before this, another exchange house received an even larger penalty of Dh200 million. In this specific Dh200 million case, the branch manager was personally fined Dh500,000 and permanently banned from working in any UAE-licensed financial institution, marking a strong stance against individual accountability.





Broader Reach: Foreign banks have also been subject to scrutiny. The Central Bank recently penalized two UAE branches of international banks with a combined Dh18.1 million in fines; one received Dh10.6 million, and the other Dh7.5 million, both for failing to meet AML/CFT compliance standards. Earlier in February, an exchange house operating in the UAE was given a penalty of Dh3.5 million. Furthermore, in March, five banks and two insurance companies were fined a combined Dh2.62 million by the CBUAE.

A Clear Message: Zero Tolerance and No Safe Haven







The United Arab Emirates is ringing a stark new alarm for financial institutions, unleashing an intense crackdown on money laundering and terrorism financing. UAE regulators have recently imposed staggering penalties totaling over Dh339 million, targeting a spectrum of financial institutions including local exchange houses, international bank branches, and insurance companies. This robust enforcement sends an unmistakable signal across the Emirates: the fight against money laundering and terrorism financing is paramount, and there will be no leniency for those who fail to protect the financial system from exploitation.The Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE) has been particularly active in its crackdown, issuing a series of substantial fines.Across all these cases, regulators consistently identified a common issue: systemic weaknesses in how these institutions monitored and reported suspicious transactions, as well as in how they verified the identities of their clients and the true beneficiaries behind financial dealings.The UAE's intensified crackdown is no longer limited solely to the traditional banking sector. Authorities are actively expanding their regulatory oversight to include other sectors that have historically been less regulated but carry a high risk for illicit activities. These include:To boost the effectiveness of these expanded efforts, the UAE Ministry of Economy has teamed up with Dubai Police. Their collaboration focuses on tightening surveillance of suspicious transactions within these high-risk sectors.A crucial part of this partnership involves creating direct and secure data-sharing channels, particularly for beneficial ownership details. This aims to clearly identify the true individuals who ultimately own or control corporate structures and financial dealings, making it harder to hide illicit funds.With fines now reaching into the hundreds of millions of dirhams and strict bans being enforced at the individual level, the message from UAE regulators is unequivocal: there is absolute zero tolerance for institutions that fail to protect the financial system from abuse. As stated in a report by Justin Varghese, Your Money Editor, ""The message from UAE regulators is clear: there is zero tolerance for institutions that fail to protect the financial system from abuse. ""The UAE remains committed to enhancing its efforts to meet global compliance standards and avoid being placed on international watchlists. Consequently, businesses operating in any of these high-risk sectors are now under increased pressure to significantly upgrade their internal controls and procedures. Failure to do so could result in severe penalties, sending a strong deterrent message across the financial landscape.",CBUAE recently fined six exchange houses Dh12.3 million for breaching AML regulations.

Britain, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and Norway on Tuesday imposed sanctions on two far-right Israeli cabinet ministers, Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, accusing them of inciting extremist violence and enabling human rights abuses against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank.The coordinated move by five Western nations traditionally supportive of Israel marked a strong condemnation of Israel’s settlement expansion and a rare diplomatic rebuke of top Israeli officials. The sanctions, which include travel bans and asset freezes, come amid heightened violence in the West Bank following the October 7, 2023, Hamas attacks and the subsequent Gaza war.In a joint statement, the countries' foreign ministers said Ben-Gvir and Smotrich ""have incited extremist violence and serious abuses of Palestinian human rights. Extremist rhetoric advocating the forced displacement of Palestinians and the creation of new Israeli settlements is appalling and dangerous.”UK foreign secretary David Lammy said the two ministers had been “inciting violence against Palestinian people for months and months and months"" and “encouraging egregious abuses of human rights.”Both men are key figures in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition.Ben-Gvir, the national security minister, responded defiantly, writing on social media: “We overcame Pharaoh, we’ll overcome Starmer’s Wall,” referring to UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Smotrich, the finance minister, learned of the sanctions while inaugurating a new West Bank settlement and said, “We are determined to continue building. ”Israel’s foreign minister Gideon Saar labelled the sanctions “outrageous” and said he would consult with Netanyahu to coordinate a response.The move reflects increasing global frustration with Israel’s conduct in the occupied territories. Netanyahu himself is the subject of an ICC arrest warrant over alleged war crimes in Gaza — allegations he has denied, accusing the court of bias.The Biden administration had earlier imposed sanctions on violent Israeli settlers in the West Bank, a policy that was reversed during Donald Trump’s presidency.Israeli human rights lawyer Eitay Mack, who has long campaigned for action against Ben-Gvir and Smotrich, called the sanctions “historic,” saying they “break the wall of immunity Israeli politicians have enjoyed.” He added, “It is a message to Netanyahu himself that he could be next.”Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem during the 1967 war. Today, over 500,000 settlers live in the West Bank in communities deemed illegal by most of the international community, while around 3 million Palestinians live under Israeli military control.

The Rediscovery of Faith in Captivity



Nietzsche Underground



The Fragility of Life, the Tenacity of Faith







More than a century ago, Friedrich Nietzsche famously declared that “God is dead.” But in the fetid, pitch-dark tunnels beneath Gaza—where air was scarce, food scarce still, and the future nearly absent—God and Nietzsche coexisted.For dozens of Israeli hostages taken during Hamas’s brutal October 7, 2023, attack, survival meant something more than physical endurance. Inside those underground cells, belief returned with unexpected force—sometimes in the form of sacred verses from the Book of Psalms, other times through the secular wisdom of Nietzsche’s existential despair. What united them was the same core truth: the need for meaning, for something to hold onto when everything else—light, freedom, identity—was stripped away.Omer Shem Tov, 20 at the time of his abduction, had been a secular Israeli, waiting tables and planning a post-army trip to South America. He was seized at the Nova music festival, along with friends, and quickly spirited into the Gaza tunnel network—lowered underground in a plastic tub.Days into his captivity, without access to clocks or sunlight, Shem Tov began to pray. He clung to Psalm 20—“May the Lord answer you on a day of distress”—a passage that, by eerie coincidence, his mother was reciting back home in Herzliya, unaware her son had adopted the same verse as his mantra.For him, faith didn’t emerge as sudden revelation, but as necessity—a response to isolation, uncertainty, and fear. He began blessing his food, making promises to God, and vowed to don tefillin in prayer if he ever returned home.But if God gave him ritual, Nietzsche offered something else: a reason to endure. A saying frequently repeated among hostages was drawn from the German philosopher, popularised by Holocaust survivor Viktor Frankl: “He who has a why can bear with any how.” It had reportedly been spoken by Hersh Goldberg-Polin, an Israeli-American hostage, before he was executed by his captors. The phrase reverberated through the tunnels like scripture. One hostage later had it tattooed on his arm.Shem Tov wasn’t alone in finding God in Gaza. Other hostages, like Eli Sharabi—who survived 491 days in captivity only to learn that his wife and two daughters had been killed—described saying the Shema Yisrael prayer each night and attempting to recite the kiddush over water when wine wasn’t available.Ritual became resistance. For many, Jewish observance wasn’t imposed by identity politics or external pressure—it was personal, a lifeline in the most dehumanising conditions imaginable. One hostage described saving a bottle of grape-flavoured drink for the Sabbath prayer. Others placed their hands on their heads in lieu of skullcaps. To the captors, it may have seemed like theatre. To the hostages, it was meaning.And yet, alongside God, Nietzsche endured. Stripped of everything familiar, hostages turned to a philosopher who had buried God in the pages of The Gay Science but also taught generations that suffering could be endured if one had a reason. In the absence of hope, they made purpose. In the absence of time, they made ritual.Even Shem Tov’s captors unwittingly played a role. After an Israeli military unit passed above ground, the gunmen handed Shem Tov reading material they had recovered—suspecting hidden codes. Among the texts: religious literature, and a printed card of Psalm 20. No names, no signatures. Just the verse. It mirrored the exact same card that had been handed to his mother months earlier by a hostage support group.At one point, Shem Tov spent 50 days in a dark, suffocating tunnel cell. He was given a biscuit a day, a few drops of brackish water, and suffered asthma attacks that went nearly untreated. In desperation, he begged God to move him—anywhere else. Within minutes, his captors relocated him to a better chamber. Whether miracle or coincidence, he saw it as divine intervention.From there, he survived through quiet cooperation—cleaning, cooking, helping clear debris after tunnel collapses. He maintained the Sabbath. He saved a bottle of drink for a moment of blessing. He kept faith alive in a place designed to crush it.Now home, he prays daily with tefillin, just as he promised. He has toured Jewish communities in the US, speaking not only of suffering but of resilience. His mother, too, now observes the Sabbath. Theirs is not a tale of religious conversion, but of rediscovery—of how stripped of society’s noise, ancient traditions and modern philosophy became tools of survival.","Omer Shem Tov, 20 at the time of his abduction, had been a secular Israeli, waiting tables and planning a post-army trip to South America.

From June 10 to June 30, travellers utilizing Terminal 1 Car Park B, Terminal 2, and Terminal 3 at DXB can take full advantage of these newly reduced long-stay parking rates.Under this compelling new offer, long-term travellers now have access to exceptional value:These updated rates represent a substantial saving compared to the standard tariffs, providing a much-needed sense of relief and peace of mind for UAE residents embarking on extended vacations abroad.The introduction of these discounted rates is more than just an enticing offer; it's an integral part of Dubai Airports' broader strategy to significantly enhance passenger flow and streamline the entire airport experience during its peak operating season.By offering compelling prices for official airport parking, the airport is actively encouraging travellers to choose designated parking facilities over curbside drop-offs. This deliberate shift aims to markedly reduce the often-frustrating traffic bottlenecks that can occur at terminal entrances, ensuring a less stressful start to any journey.Furthermore, the benefits of this summer offer extend beyond just those flying out. Visitors arriving at DXB specifically to pick up incoming guests are also advised to utilize the airport’s designated car parks or convenient valet services. Importantly, these visitors too can now benefit from the very same reduced parking rates under the summer promotion.","Travellers can now park for up to two weeks for just Dh300 across all DXB terminals. From June 10 to June 30, travellers utilizing Terminal 1 Car Park B, Terminal 2, and Terminal 3 can take full advantage of these newly reduced long- stay parking rates.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121755926,imgsize-1067056,width-400,resizemode-4/121755926.jpg"

The Lunar Arrival: Times and What to Expect

Best Views: Where to Look Up

Why until 2043: A Rare Lunar Standstill





As the sun dips below the horizon on Tuesday, a rare and truly stunning sight awaits those gazing at the sky across the UAE: the Strawberry Moon, the last full Moon of Spring 2025. This particular moon event holds special meaning, confirmed to be visible throughout the Emirates, not least because it's the last time this specific phenomenon will appear so remarkably low in the sky until the year 2043. For anyone eager to witness nature’s grand show, tomorrow, June 11, offers a chance not to be missed.The exact times for this heavenly display have been carefully set. Khadijah Hasan Ahmed, Operations Manager at the Dubai Astronomy Group (DAG), told Gulf News on Tuesday, June 10, that ""The Strawberry Moon will be visible in the UAE, with moonrise at approximately 7:32 PM on June 11 and moonset at 5:55 AM on June 12."" This generous time frame, stretching from evening twilight into the early morning, gives plenty of opportunity for viewing. Importantly, Khadijah Hasan Ahmed also confirmed that the Strawberry Moon will indeed be visible everywhere in the UAE, easing any worries about where to see it. The best part, she stressed, is how easy it is to watch: ""And the best part is that you don’t need any special equipment to see it.""For residents wanting the most impressive views of this lunar wonder, simplicity is key. You can simply step outside and look towards the eastern horizon soon after the moonrise at 7:32 PM.The Strawberry Moon is expected to be seen with just your eyes, assuming the skies are clear. Khadijah Hasan Ahmed suggested that the best places to watch are usually wide, open areas like peaceful beaches, the vastness of the desert, or elevated spots that offer a clear view. Even in the city, the Moon can still be seen if you have a clear line of sight to the eastern horizon. While looking with your bare eyes is a wonderful experience, she thoughtfully added, ""Of course, using binoculars or telescopes would definitely enhance the view,"" promising an even more detailed look at the Moon’s surface.This particular moon event, as highlighted by Khadijah Hasan Ahmed, is ""a beautiful, easy-to-watch celestial event that connects us with the universe."" She warmly described the Strawberry Moon as the final full moon of Spring and ""one of the most visually striking, often appearing larger and more golden when it rises."" It's important, however, to remember its name doesn't mean its color: despite its appealing name, the Strawberry Moon will not actually look pink or red. Its usual color, affected by air conditions when it's low on the horizon, is typically a warm yellow or a bright orange.The true charm and compelling reason not to miss this Full Strawberry Moon on June 11 comes from its connection to a truly rare natural event: a Great Lunar Standstill. This significant alignment of the Moon happens only once every 18.6 years, making tomorrow's event an exceptionally rare pairing.Khadijah Hasan Ahmed, using information from the astronomy app Star Walk 2, explained the phenomenon's different effects in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres: ""In the Northern Hemisphere, it will be the lowest Full Moon until 2043, staying unusually close to the horizon. Conversely, in the Southern Hemisphere, it will be the highest Full Moon until 2043."" This precise and rare position is directly due to the major lunar standstill cycle. ""It’s like the Moon’s version of a solstice,"" she clarified, offering an easy comparison for its unique path.To be clear, For those in the Northern Hemisphere, including the UAE, this particular Full Moon on June 11 will be the lowest seen in 18.6 years. It'll rise and set at its farthest points to the southeast and southwest. In the Southern Hemisphere, it's the opposite: they'll see their highest Full Moon this month, with their lowest coming in December. This happens because the Moon's orbit is tilted about 5.1 degrees compared to Earth's path. When this tilt combines with Earth's own 23.4-degree tilt during a major standstill, the Moon appears at its most extreme positions. This complex interplay means the June 11 Strawberry Moon isn't just a pretty sight; it's a rare cosmic event that won't appear this low again for almost two decades.","The Strawberry Moon will be visible in the UAE from approximately 7:32 PM on June 11 until 5:55 AM on June 12. This particular moon event holds special meaning, not least because it's the last time this specific phenomenon will appear so remarkably low in the sky until the year 2043.

Marriage contracts in the UAE: Why more couples are choosing prenups,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/marriage-contracts-in-the-uae-why-more-couples-are-choosing-prenups/articleshow/121751700.cms,"Legal experts say prenuptial agreements can often reduce the bitterness and legal chaos that sometimes follow a marriage breakdown ( Representational Image)

A Landmark Legal Shift in the UAE

Learning from Experience: Fostering Clarity and Reducing Conflict

A Modern Tool for Financial Protection and Management

Custom-Fit Agreements: Bridging Cultural Divides





The fairytale notion of eternal bliss often overshadows the pragmatic realities of marriage, but in the Gulf region, a quiet revolution is taking foot. Increasingly, couples are choosing to safeguard their futures not just with vows, but with prenuptial agreements. This burgeoning trend is particularly pronounced in the UAE, a nation rapidly evolving its legal landscape to meet modern demands. Here, significant reforms have smoothed the path for drafting, recognizing, and enforcing these crucial contracts. While the concept of a prenup might still carry a whisper of social stigma, suggesting, perhaps, a lack of faith in enduring love, and certainly can't guarantee a ""happily ever after,"" legal minds are unequivocallychampioning their power. As highlighted in a Khaleej Times report, these agreements are proving to be remarkably effective tools in softening the sharp edges of separation, transforming what could be acrimonious legal battles into more manageable, and ultimately, less bitter transitions. It's a clear signal that for many, maturity and foresight are now as vital to a strong union as love itself.A pivotal development that profoundly impacted the landscape of prenuptial agreements in the UAE occurred in 2021.This was with the introduction of Abu Dhabi Law No. 14/2021 on Personal Status for Non-Muslim Foreigners, a legislative move subsequently reinforced by Resolution No. (8) of 2022. Together, these established a clear and robust legal framework specifically for civil marriages. This groundbreaking legislative change allowed non-Muslim couples, predominantly expatriates residing in the UAE, to enter into marriage under a civil contract, operating independently of traditional religious laws.Tyne Hugo, a Senior Associate from the prominent law firm BSA, elaborated on the profound implications of this legal evolution for prenuptial agreements, as reported by Khaleej Times. ""As the ceremony is civilly based, it effectively allows for prenuptial agreements to be signed before marriage,"" explained Hugo. She further clarified the significant new opportunities this presented, stating, ""Couples now have the opportunity to tailor their financial arrangements from the outset, something that was previously unavailable or legally ambiguous. ""Considering the UAE's diverse demographic, which includes millions of expatriates from various cultural backgrounds, officials have increasingly focused on fostering an environment where the country feels like a long-term home rather than merely a transient stopover. This strategic approach aligns with the growing acceptance of prenups. As Tyne Hugo further conveyed to Khaleej Times, ""To attract foreigners, the UAE must cater to their cultural norms, and in the West, prenups are not only common but expected. "" This underscores the UAE's commitment to adapting its legal framework to better serve its multinational populace.While a prenuptial agreement cannot guarantee the success or longevity of a marriage, legal professionals widely acknowledge its powerful utility in reducing both the emotional and legal fallout should a union fail.BSA, the law firm, shared insights from their experience, including a recent divorce case where, despite the absence of a prenup, the couple successfully managed to negotiate an amicable financial agreement. However, as Tyne Hugo pointed out in the Khaleej Times report, this ideal scenario is not always the case. ""That’s not always the case,"" she stated, adding a vivid illustration: ""We’ve seen divorces where couples fought over everything, including the cutlery. These kinds of disputes are often more about emotions than assets."" This stark comparison highlights the potential for contentious battles in the absence of clear pre-agreed terms.Conversely, couples who have proactively signed prenuptial agreements typically report experiencing significantly less conflict and achieve faster resolutions when facing marital dissolution. ""There’s clarity,"" Tyne Hugo confirmed to Khaleej Times, emphasizing, ""and that clarity helps prevent unnecessary legal battles.""This benefit is echoed in personal experiences, such as that of Maha A., a Lebanese designer who married in the previous year. She recounted her initial reaction to her fiancé's suggestion of a prenup, telling Khaleej Times, ""I was surprised when my fiancé suggested a prenup. At first, I felt hurt."" However, her perspective quickly shifted: ""But he explained it wasn’t about preparing for divorce, it was about protecting each other. We both have separate assets and wanted to keep things clear. In the end, it actually made me feel more secure."" Maha also revealed that the process itself, though not traditionally romantic, instigated vital conversations about potentially sensitive topics like spending habits, savings goals, and possible financial risks. ""It wasn’t romantic, but it was responsible,"" she wisely concluded.Although the topic of prenuptial agreements might still be uncomfortable for some families, they are increasingly being perceived not as a threat to the sanctity of marriage but rather as a sensible means to achieve financial clarity and mutual understanding within a partnership.""Prenups don’t just deal with how assets are split in case of a divorce; they can also outline how assets are managed during the marriage,"" Tyne Hugo explained to Khaleej Times. She detailed the expansive scope of these agreements, noting that ""Partners can decide whether to have joint or separate estates and shield themselves from each other’s financial liabilities."" This protective aspect is crucial: ""If one person goes into debt, the other can ensure their assets are protected from creditors,"" she further highlighted. This demonstrates how prenups serve as a vital tool for safeguarding individual financial interests within the marital union.Cultural differences undeniably continue to influence how prenuptial agreements are viewed and accepted. In more traditional or conservative families, the very notion of signing a legal document before marriage can be perceived as an admission of doubt or a sign of distrust in the relationship.""Some cultures may see this as a betrayal of what a marriage is supposed to be,"" Tyne Hugo acknowledged in her comments to Khaleej Times. Nevertheless, she underscored the remarkable adaptability of prenups: ""But the beauty of a prenup is that it’s entirely customisable. It can reflect any cultural or religious values the couple deems important."" This flexibility allows the agreement to be tailored to respect and incorporate various deeply held beliefs and practices.Despite traditional reservations, younger couples, particularly those from dual-nationality backgrounds or who have been raised in more globalized environments, are increasingly viewing prenups in a progressive light. This evolving perspective is indicative of a broader shift in societal attitudes towards financial planning within marriage.Speaking to Khaleej Times, Rania F., a licensed marriage and family therapist based in Dubai, confirmed this trend, that ""Couples are beginning to realise that love and legal planning are not mutually exclusive."" She offered a nuanced perspective on the purpose of such agreements: ""A prenup doesn’t mean you expect a divorce, it just means you’re mature enough to talk about money, expectations, and personal boundaries before problems arise. "" Rania F. also noted that a growing number of her clients are actively inquiring about prenups during premarital counseling sessions. This is particularly prevalent in situations where one partner owns a business, has children from a previous marriage, or carries significant debt, where the need for clear financial boundaries and protections becomes even more apparent.","Legal experts say prenuptial agreements can often reduce the bitterness and legal chaos that sometimes follow a marriage breakdown.
